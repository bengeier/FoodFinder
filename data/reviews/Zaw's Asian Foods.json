{"text":"We're still looking, but nothing in the Bay Area compares to Zaw's.  The sesame chicken with a little spice...yum!  Each serving is cooked to order (over HUGE flames--wish my range could do that) . MMMM.  Good Chinese-American food, tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Zaw's is, hands down, the best Chinese food in Squirrel Hill. Everything I have ordered has always been fresh, hot, and most importantly, delicious.

But it's not just the good food that endears this place to me. The gentleman that runs this establishment is the nicest man I have ever met, and he sealed my loyalty on my second visit about a year ago.

I arrived to pick up my food, only to realize I was short about $5. My girlfriend volunteered to walk to a nearby ATM, while I stayed behind. After about 30 seconds, the owner picked up my order, held it out to me, and told me to take it and I could pay him back next time. This was only my second time in his restaurant, and he was trusting me to not just take the food and conveniently \"forget\" to pay him back.

So, good food and good people? Why would you go anywhere else?"}
{"text":"This was the first place I ate at when I moved to Squirrel Hill, it was WORTH IT! Affordable, quick, and above all delicious. The inside of the shop isn't pretty, but don't let that fool you (it's take-out, who cares?). The man that owns the shop is also incredibly nice and polite- he'll be the one answering the phone and cashing you out. Highly highly recommended."}
{"text":"Never waited more then they tild me to wait food on point everytime lo main with extra beef very good egg roll very good.. the owner does its job good..very simple.. I love it! And u can NOT beat the price $$$$"}
{"text":"We've been ordering from Zaws for over 7 years. We have tried many asian places in Pittsburgh and we keep coming back to Zaws. 

The food is fresh (that's why it takes close to 40 minutes) not microwaved or just recooked like at most asian places you see. 

Best general tso chicken and Mongolian beef by far. The owner, Sonny, is the nicest man you'll ever meet and know your name by no time. 

Great place! Great food! Great people!"}
{"text":"I have loved this place for so long and I can't believe I never thought to review it on Yelp!  They serve delicious and fresh food.   My personal favorite is the Sesame Tofu and Shrimp Egg  Rolls.  Great food and awesome people.

P.S. Those people behind the counter, working diligently to make you an awesome meal would probably appreciate a dollar or two in the tip jar."}
{"text":"2011: I just changed a plane flight to eat at Zaw's. That's how much I love their General Tso's. Have been searching for years for something similar that I don't have to fly to eat, but so far have failed.

2013: Zaws is still a hole-in-the wall and still my favorite Asian food I've ever found. The things people mention in other reviews, such as the cleanliness of the floors, and unrealistic time estimates on the phone are all true, but I've always found the food and the personal attention to be well worth it. I've lived in several other cities since Pittsburgh, but still make a point of eating at Zaws every time I'm in town.

2015: Still here and still Zaws. I'm sitting here at what is almost always my last stop on my way out of Pittsburgh. I really don't care how \"authentic\" to anything their General Tso's is, the sweet and spicy with big chunks of chicken is still how I want it."}
{"text":"I have a hard time understanding some of the negative reviews of Zaw's.  Is it authentic? - No.  Is it fresh and delicious? - YES!!!  I'll admit that I was a skeptic at first, but gave it a try on the recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed.  I've been steadily working my way through the menu and everything I've had is good.  Some of my favorites are Lo Mein (any kind), Sesame Chicken, and Hunan Beef.  The items on the menu that are indicated as spicy are actually spicy... so watch it if you ask for anything \"spicy\" that is already supposed to be spicy.  I normally order my Lo Mein spicy, and it can be dangerously hot depending on the day... but it's a good burn.  Everything they make is exceedingly fresh and the flavors are tremendous.

If you're more comfortable paying double for a place that \"has tables\", \"takes credit cards\" or \"has a kitchen you can't see\", then Zaw's is not for you.  Try Jimmy Wan's or any of the other \"fancy\" Chinese restaurants in town.  Otherwise - enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is what Chinese takeout should be.  This is old school American Chinese food.  Everything is fresh and made to order from scratch & cheap.  It's like a really good Chinese greasy spoon.  Had the Chop Suey, Singapore noodles, and dumplings.  Everything was really awesomely flavored.  

You know that scene in Blade Runner when Gaff finds Deckard at the noodle shop?  That's what the Singapore noodles taste like.  That scene."}
{"text":"I think this place is Pittsburgh's best-kept secret.  The typical American-Chinese dishes are fine, but the other stuff is what's really great.  My favorites are the coconut chicken curry, the roast pork with garlic noodles, and the Malaysian beef fried rice.  Order extra spicy and you really get extra spicy.  Also, the won ton soup is gingery and scalliony and the best medicine for a cold."}
{"text":"I was a die hard Zaw's fan for years, however, after last night's takeout, it may be awhile before I go back. I ordered chicken lo mein, after a few bites, I noticed I began tasting small clumps of salt in my lo mein!! To my dismay, the entire container contained small clumps of salt. So, not the best experience I've ever had from Zaw's but the samosas that I always order were delicious as ever."}
{"text":"The best general tso! Saucy, spicy and very fresh. You can't beat the lunch special. Let's face it, this place isn't much on the inside and some may say it is dirty, but the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Such a strange restaurant.  

1)  It is filthy.  Hard to get around this.
2)  The portions are very generous.
3)  We were told 25 minutes for our take out.  After we arrived at the place (25 minutes in) there was no sign of our food.  When we asked they said that it wasn't ready yet.  OK...  Then we were ignored for half an hour as seven different other take out customers got their order with little or no wait.
3.5)  While we waited we were smoked out by fires in the kitchen three times!  Thick black smoke that made it difficult to breathe! 
4)  The food was OK when we got it not the best or worst chinese food that I have ever had and certainly not worth the wait.
5)  They don't take credit cards?!?

Will not be returning..."}
{"text":"This place is great.  A friend (who used to live nearby) recommended it to me a few years ago and I've been going there for almost 6 years now.  It's got some of the best Asian food I've ever had.  The chicken chow fun, sesame chicken, and delights of three are some personal favorites.  Highly recommend for east asian food if you live in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"I have been going to Zaw's since 1995. Excellent food for a decent price. I now live in O'Hara Township and still order food from Zaw's.  Sonny, Phillip, and Esther are wonderful people and have always treated me nicely. Yes, it can take up to an hour for the food, but well worth it."}
{"text":"this must be that hole inthe wall i still dream about. tis true -the burmese chicken curry with coconut rice is great. friendly owners too"}
{"text":"Anyone that's giving this place a bad review is actually an idiot. This place is freakin amazing!! Everything is made to order in front of you, fresh, delicious, and the meat is always amazing as well as the sauces. I've lived in a lot of places and eaten a lot of Asian food (Seattle and NYC, 18 years and 5 years). This is some of the best Chinese I've ever had."}
{"text":"How the @$#%&?! do you screw up rice and call yourself an Asian place? 

I don't understand those who say this is the best Chinese food in Pittsburgh. I drove here from Oakland based on the reviews, but the rolling cart in the atrium of Newell-Simon Hall at CMU is better. This place is super, super cheap, but you get what you pay for. Cash only, no delivery. The staff are friendly, and know their regulars by face, but the food is greasy, below-average Chinese take out, and their rice is hard and undercooked. It wasn't a one-time thing, either. I went a second time (it is cheap) and the rice turned out the same. I will not be going back again, especially when I live a block from Orient Kitchen."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Their lunch special is dirt cheap--under $5 for an entr√©e, with rice and a side of soup. I got the sweet and sour chicken, which was a mistake because the sauce was so sweet it tasted like a fruit cocktail. For the side of soup, I got the hot and sour soup. It tasted nothing like hot and sour soup, and it looked nothing like hot and sour soup. It tasted more like a beef stew with chunks of tofu. The food was made when ordered, so no doubt about the freshness. However, I didn't think the lunch special was that tasty. My first dinning experience here with the sweet and sour chicken was a disaster. DO NOT get the sweet and sour chicken! As for the rest of the menu, I'm not sure if I have the courage to venture back here."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food.  Very spicy great lunch prices"}
{"text":"Either I had an unusual experience at Zaw's or everyone in Pittsburgh needs to venture out of state to find real authentic Chinese food.

The high reviews from Yelp encouraged my drive from Rivers Casino all the way to Zaw's.  I called ahead and they kindly told me that they'd be open till 10pm tonight. I was excited because I was craving Chinese food!

The cashier (whom I will assume is the owner) was extremely kind and friendly.  I ordered a large Pork Chow Mein and General Tso's Chicken.  Just FYI, this is really expensive Chinese fast food!! I was born and raised in San Francisco so I suppose that may have played a large factor.  But $7.95 for a large chow mein and $8.95 for the chicken is outrageous (or it would be in the west coast)!  I told myself this had to be amazing for what they're charging.

You can imagine my disappointment when I opened up the chow mein to find that it wasn't even chow mein!! It did have pork, but there were NO NOODLES. All I had in that red and white take out box was thin slices of roast pork, a big batch of cooked BEAN SPROUTS, and an overwhelming amount of SAUCE?!? i was so upset that I paid $8 for it.  I've taken a picture so please tell me this was just a huge mistake.  There are absolutely no noodles in my chow mein.  I didn't pay for a big box of cheap bean sprouts.  I have no idea how this happened because I even watched the cook make it from my seat on one of their bar stools! We must both be blind. Zaw's had the nicest man in the world working there but I do hope they read this as to make sure they don't make the same mistake with anyone else.

The General Tso's Chicken wasn't so great either.  They put way too much sauce on everything! That is some THICKKKK sauce they're using. My boyfriend found it decent but I may have already been scarred by the chow mein.

I was starving and upset so we ventured off to Primanti Bro's nearby since our chinese take out didn't make the cut."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. The level of filth is off putting as soon as you walk in. I saw the cook lick his finger and blow his nose without washing his hands within 5 minutes. This place should be shut down. Stay away."}
{"text":"Really gonna miss this place. Been ordering there for years. They know who you are and what you like whenever you call. Very sad to see this place go. Their food was perfection."}
{"text":"This is a MSG-injected chinese takeout place.  My expectations were pretty low, but I visited because of the positive reviews Zaw's received on Yelp.  

My initial reaction was negative, because they do not accept credit cards and the non-kitchen area was filthy... leaving me wondering when the last time I received a tetanus shot.

However, I gave them four stars, because they followed through on what matters.  Mainly, the food was cooked to order before my very own two eyes.  While the entrance is dirty, the kitchen appeared sanitary.  The ingredients were of a higher quality than I expected: fresh veggies and higher quality pork.  I walked a half of a mile home, and my food was still piping hot.  The portions were generous.

I would eat from here again, but will not recommend to friends, because the place looks sketchy."}
{"text":"Food is always good and consistently the same.  The owner is probably the nicest man you will ever meet.  This place is a hole in the wall and it is take out only but i reccomend it to anyone who wants quality cheap takeout."}
{"text":"This is your prototypical hole-in-the-wall Chinese place that isn't low on ambience, it's non-existent but high on quality. 

Food is prepared in front of you by a 113 yr old former Tai Chi master. And...there is an awesome pile of16 yr old National Geographics on the counter for you to read while your meal is being freshly prepared.

What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Is the restaurant dirty? Yes, yes it is.  And I have no problem with that.  

The people working are always super nice, when I order something \"super spicy\" they actually manage to do that, the prices are super low, and (with exception of the egg rolls) the food is always tasty."}
{"text":"felt like it was below quality meat covered with a straight from can type sweet sauce on top"}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese takeout. You can get your dish made spicy, but be careful it'll be extremely spicy. Another cash only place on Murray Ave."}
{"text":"I love this little place. I used to live around the corner and would go here all the time. The owner is really nice. It reminds me of a place where you might be able to buy a Mogwai. I always get the General Tso's chicken. They cook it right in front of you in a wok that has probably seen more chicken than colonel sanders. It actually might be the original wok. 

The thing I love about this place is that it doesn't try to be anything more than it is: an old, kinda dirty, delicious, little Chinese takeout joint. Very genuine."}
{"text":"Hands down, best Asian food ever...seriously EVER.

You will not find anything better in any city.

Okay, okay...it's small, doesn't deliver, doesn't take cash and the walls have gotten progressively more yellowish-brown over the years but the food is amazing and better yet, it's super cheap.

Sonny is the guy who runs the place.  After he learns your name, believe me - he will never forget it.

I highly recommend the lunch specials...4 dollars gets you a huge amount of food.

A few of my favorites:

- Sesame tofu
- Fried bean sprouts & tofu
- Lemon chicken
- Szechuan Eggplant
- Chicken & black bean sauce

PS - Egg drop soup = best!"}
{"text":"This is a really great neighborhood take-out place; we've been getting food here for many years. But pay attention to the \"Asian\" in the title; these are not Chinese people and they do dishes other than the expected standards. Also, this is not the place for your romantic once-in-a-lifetime gastronomic adventure; it's a place that gives you consistently good, well prepared, food, on a regular basis.

The folks in there are from Burma (brother, sister, husband thereof); they make food that seems to be from all over. Since this is the U.S., most of the menu is standard Chinese-American, but check out the dishes listed on the right-hand side of the menu. There's a real range. In particular the curried dishes are invariably yummy.

Ordering by phone is the right thing to do. Sonny would always tell me (it seemed) that your order will be ready in \"40 minutes\". For a while I was puzzled by this, especially since the food never seemed to be ready at the promised time. Eventually I figured out that they wait for you to show up and then make your meal  and so you end up with fresh made dishes. We're regular customers, so this works out. You probably have to go there a number of times before they start to recognize you on the phone.

I'm a bit puzzled by some of the other reviews: you're not going to get something just like what you got in some particular West Coast eatery; eating out is about variety, and being open to different approaches. In any case, if you want to be picky, in my experience none of the stuff in this country is anything like what you get in mainland China (where the cuisine is just totally way better).

Among the things that I like about this place is that they cook everything to order (I can't believe someone compared Zaw's to the vendor at CMU that serves almost everything from a steam table; yuk). Certain dishes stand out: I hate to use this one as the example, but their General T'so chicken is (I think) the best I've had in the city. Many other places treat this as a \"chicken-flavored fried dough\" dish. Zaw's does it right: the batter is very thin and the chicken is all white. It tastes as a chicken dish; who cares if there's a bit too much sauce? Yes, I know that T'so's is not \"real\" Chinese, but I believe that Zaw's preparation of it tells you what you need to know about their general approach.

I should point out that there's also some real losers on the menu. But so what? Just figure out the bits that you enjoy and go for it."}
{"text":"We tried Zaw's as a recommendation from friends.  It is take out only, but for a quick Friday after work dinner it hit the spot.  I am not a huge Chinese food fan.  But I definitely liked the food.  The egg rolls were fresh and not super greasy.   I had some veggie Lo Mein that was delicious!  (The the left overs were great the next day too!) I asked for the Lo Mein spicy and it delivered.  Apparently all their food is a little spicy to begin with so if you ask for it spicy be ready!  It did not disappoint.  My fiance, who LOVES Chinese food, really liked this place too.  He said it is not the best he has ever had, but certainly would ea here again!  We are excited to try some other things on the menu.
Like I said it is take out only and cash only.  They are also preparing thing fresh so it takes a little bit of time to prepare.  We ordered at 430 and picked up at 5.  I think the prices are very reasonable also."}
{"text":"Best Asian food in the city!!!! 

Though there are a few (and very minor) drawbacks: Must pay cash, place is old and a bit dirty on the customer end,  this food is fabulous! Fresh chicken, beef, shrimp, pork and veggies (also tofu dishes as well). Forget about that hammered-thin chicken filled with MSG you see so often in Asian fast-food restaurants. You can see them prepare every morsel of your food; 100% fresh! Zaw's is as fresh as it gets. Like spice? Get it as hot as you want (if you ask for spicy, it's gonna be SPICY). I have tried many of the items on the menu and found about 5 that I rotate every time I order. Trust me!!!! I have been eating there for over 12 years. once you find your dish, you will be craving it at 6 in the morning. 

Once Sonny, one of the owners, learns your name and the dishes you enjoy, He will recognize your voice on the phone and know your order before you can make it. The three staff: husband, wife and brother are loving, personable people who deliver great food for an unbelievable price. 

Recommendations:

1) Order by phone. When Sonny says it will be 45 minutes, it will probably be close to an hour and 15 minutes if you want to just run in and pick up your food. If you go \"on time\" you will wait as the make your food fresh right in front of you. Don't worry! Your food is given to you hot and fresh; don't get discouraged as other customers come in and get their food before you. It is ALWAYS busy, but these customers have waited at home for at least an hour and 15 minutes... worth the wait.

2) Try it more than once and try several dishes. This IS NOT you average Asian food take out. It may take 2-3 times to find what you like, but...worth the wait.

3) If you enjoy a bit of spice DO NOT ask for extra spice. The food is a tiny bit spicy in all the dishes I've tried (about 20 different dishes). To add spice it to get it SPICY (which I love). 

4) Do not concern yourself with the restaurant itself. It is old and a bit dirty, but once you eat the food and meet Sonny and the other staff, you will know that the food prep and kitchen is well up to standards. There is a reason it is take out only and so popular, not just with people who enjoy a hole-in-the -wall food place, but all walks of Pittsburgh people who enjoy great food.

5) Be a regular customer. Sonny and his family make you feel like you are the only customer that matters at Zaw's, but here is a secret: he does it to every single return customer (and there are a lot of them). Feel free to adjust your meal to suit your needs. My wife asks for all-white meat chicken in the General T-so's Chicken (know it's not spelled correctly, but this is not your average meal) and I get extra onions in my Pork Lo Mein .

Try it a few times, find what you like and I promise you you will not be able to live without Zaw's Asian food.

P.S. I had it last night!"}
{"text":"I am so upset about this I can't even express it. The curry chicken here was my favorite thing to eat to the point where I would consider it as a last meal. It was a red spicy curry sauce with garlic and ginger and chicken broth. I will miss it so much"}
{"text":"This is a great take out place in Squirrell Hill (Murray & Hobart). We order from here almost every other week.  Almost always get the same dish-- Burmese Chicken Curry.  The great thing about this place is that they make every dish to order rather than premaking it... you can watch the cook make the food when you go to pick up.  They have good hot and sour soup too."}
{"text":"Decided to give such highly reviewed Americanized Asian food for once and immediately regretted it. \"Why not give it a try,\" we thought to ourselves. Everyone knows it's not \"authentic,\" but people are saying that the food is delightful. I ordered a sweet and sour pork, friend ordered the General Tso's, both lunch specials. 

We both opened our small boxes (I guess the size fits the price) and found, on the left side, a bunch of meat chunks smothered in sauce, and some white rice on the right side. Only difference was that sweet and sour was bright red, while General Tso's was brownish orange. Two tiny sad pieces of broccoli in the latter and some onion and bell pepper pieces drowned in the former. \"Okay... well maybe it'll taste good despite its appearance,\" we thought.

We each took a bite of both, followed by self-reflecting thoughts on what sins we committed recently to be subjected to such painful karma. We literally could not even tell the difference between the chicken and the pork. On the outside there was no crispiness; on the inside the meat was hard and stringy instead of tender. The worst part were the sauces. They were disgustingly dense and heavy, both too sweet and overwhelming. It was a miracle that we could even taste the differences between the two.

So here we were, trying to stomach these chunks of \"meat\" lavishly dressed in two types of sauce. We couldn't take any bite without accompanying it without rice. Oh right, the rice. It was so obviously western style rice that it wasn't funny. You would think that they would at least get Asian rice to go with their dishes, but nope. The wonton soup didn't help things either. The soup tasted completely of MSG, and the wontons were mostly hard pieces of flour skins with a tidbit of meat inside. Lovely.

The place itself is dirty and revolting. The floors, the counters, the signs, the trash can, the out of order soda machine. You would think the owners could put some effort into making the place look better, but nope. I guess it's to cater to those loyal customers who have grown up on this \"food\" for more of a homely feel.

Seriously, stay as far away from this place as possible. Unless you are homeless or a broke college student (or just like eating loads of sauce), nearby Sichuan Gourmet and Rose Tea are undoubtedly better choices."}
{"text":"I was driving through Squirrel Hill today , and decided that Chinese would hit the spot . I did not know this was a \" take out \"  only kinda place. ....Food was ok I guess, I did not get a fortune cookie or any additional sauces. The place looks dirty as many other reviewers had mentioned.
Not sure if I could recommend this place. kinda on the fence."}
{"text":"Nice place .... Dishes are very tasty .. Tried Schezwan Chicken, Egg Roll and Fried Rice and they were amazing ... Though the look of the restaurant is a bit old but food quality is good !!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Every time I come back to PGH, I eat here. My choice? The Szechuan Bean Curd. Cheap. Plentiful. Super yummy. Eat here now."}
{"text":"Very tasty General Tso's chicken. The preparation time was fairly short and was cooked right in front of me as I waited. There's not a lot of room for seating, and the plasticware provided for my eat-in order was flimsy, but overall very good."}
{"text":"Since moving here from CA a few months ago, I've been on the search for good chinese food.  Growing up on some of the best SF has to offer, I'm a tough critic.  But I have one dish that I order at every chinese restaurant and that is beef chow fun.  I love it! I love it without a gravy and I've eaten so much of it in my life I sometimes wonder if I'm not going to turn into a noodle one day.

Well we had been hearing all of these magical things about the food at Zaw's and how it is the best chinese food around, blah blah blah.  

So one day we decided to try it, we made sure to have cash on us and were excited for the meal ahead.  Well I ordered my beef chow fun and asked for it 'dry and with bean sprouts' well he told me NO! They didn't do it with bean sprouts and used other veggies but cooked it in the normal way, not in a gravy and it will be good.  I came in a gravy and it wasn't good! Maybe if I ate it right when I got it instead of taking it home, because when I got home the gravy had been soaked up by the top layer of the noodles leaving the bottom ones sauce less and tastesless, the top was breaking apart and the flavors didn't balance.  

We also ordered some other dishes but those too fell short.  I'm not shocked and amazed by zaw's.  

But if I'm ordering the wrong thing, please someone tell me! What do you order that is so amazing it keeps you going back?! And do you take it home and eat or eat right there? I'll give it another try, I won't be getting my chow fun there but I'll try something else, I have to give chinese food a second chance, if not I'll be a noodleless asian girl and that's sad!"}
{"text":"Just had another great meal from Zaw's.  I have tried something different every time I've gone there and they do not disappoint.    

I love Zaw's and will go back soon."}
{"text":"Lived down the street for two years. The way this man fried chicken for general tso's was REVOLUTIONARY."}
{"text":"I'm biased against American-Chinese food, since I ate Chinese home cooking most of my childhood.  I'm giving Zaw's 3 stars, but I can see why it's gotten higher ratings here.

If you can, call in your order before you head to the eatery.  Zaw's isn't speedy, but that's a good thing, as each dish is freshly made and piping hot.  I like how the tofu is prepared--it's not overly fried or spongy, but just right.  My favorite dish is the fried bean-sprouts and tofu.  The sauce  for the sesame tofu was way too thick--oh, hey, cornstarch--and too sweet, but I think the dish is meant for someone with more of a Western palate.  The coconut tofu here has the perfect amount of spice, but I found the vegetables, which are $1 extra--the dish is normally just curry and tofu cubes--kind of disappointing, as they were just some random carrot and onion slices and some slivers of water chestnuts.  I'm aware that I've only talked about tofu dishes here, but I'm pretty sure they use similar bases for sesame chicken and the coconut curry chicken.

Even though all the previous reviewers have already said this, I think it bears repeating: the staff is extremely nice, so nice that I feel like a horrible human being for not loving everything I've ordered.  Zaw's won't cure my cravings for childhood foods, but I'll keep going back."}
{"text":"This is the definition of a hole in the wall.  It's take-out only; there's maybe four seats in the place, meant mostly for you to hang out while your food is cooked.  They don't deliver.  They're often busy.

Putting that all together, if a restaurant doesn't deliver, and doesn't have any seating, and has a stream of people through the door... the food has to fill the gap.  And it does.

I'm a big fan of the sesame tofu.  Need to stop back again soon."}
{"text":"I just had my steam veggie take out tonight. The veggie is not very fresh and tofu is about to go bad. Without sauces, you can taste the freshness of the dish. I will not return."}
{"text":"Is this for real? I read the menu...Lo Mein, Beef and Broccoli, Chicken and Black Bean sauce, pretty much everything Asian you can wish for.

The beef packs zing, the sauce is sweet, and the broccoli provides the tongue appeal. This is an amazing dish that only Zaw's can provide correctly.

Without the outrageous prices.

Delicious. I had no idea that such a hole in the wall could be so satisfying.

Like savoring the goodness of a true Beef and Broccoli dish without worrying about breaking your bank.
Ingredients;

Beef - Yes, overwhelmingly.

The sauce - That explains the sweetness. 

Broccoli - The alkaline feel of the veggie on my tongue comes from the Broccoli.

Chicken - Chicken, yes, that provides the full bodied, protein sensation.

Black Bean Sauce - More zing!

And the manager/cashier, Sonny is an absolute doll. We've ordered from him so many times that he is now proud to call us \"his friend\" and always asks how we are doing.

Okay, I'll admit that the atmosphere is nothing to write home about and it is odd that they don't take credit cards.

I don't care.

This is great Asian food."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall but oh my, these cheap eats are fantastic! The sweet and sour chicken is fantastic according to my picky friends! I loved the eggplant! 
While the place may look a little beat up and grimey you get a great view of your food being made fresh in a fiery fashion! Will be returning!"}
{"text":"This is a memorial review, because after tonight, Zaws will be closed, and I will miss them, because they are some of the nicest people you would meet in Pittsburgh, and watching them cook in the open kitchen was quite a treat. I'm sad to see them go."}
{"text":"When I asked my dad what he was most looking forward to in retirement, amongst his list he included, \"Saving money by not paying for lunch in the cafeteria.\"  My father for the past 33 years had worked at a Junior High School in Mesa, Arizona.  I laughed, asking him how much he possibly could have paid for lunch in the school's cafeteria.  He told me, \"around three dollars,\" and I good-naturedly teased him and we had a good laugh over the fact that there was no restaurant in the world where he would find a better lunch deal.

This was BEFORE I knew about the Zaw's lunch special.  Far from Mesa, AZ, on Murray Ave. in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, PA you will find the most delicious Chinese Mandarin food you have ever tasted.  Zaw's lunch special includes full meals for less than three dollars.  How is this even possible??  For those of you cynics thinking that the portions must be ridiculously small, or the food be not tasty--I assure you, neither is the case.

Sonny, the owner/manager (we are not sure, but he's been around a long time) goes out of his way to shake your hand, learn your name, and remember it--even if you haven't been in for multiple years!  Marvin, the cook who speaks less English is just as friendly if not as verbal as he whips up sesame tofu, rice, lemon chicken, Szechuan eggplant, and a variety of other dishes.

This is the kind of greasy-hole-in-the-wall Chinese that actually isn't greasy at all--that's my kind of Chinese food!  It will however satisfy your cravings that sometimes only greasy-hole-in-the-wall Chinese can alleviate. 

Go here for the lunch special.  Go here for a good time.  Go here to meet Sonny and Marvin. Go here for good food.  Bottom line: Go here.

Just to let you know: Cash only, no delivery, limited seating (get it as take-out, or eat it on the stoop next door and people watch Murray Ave.)"}
{"text":"Lil bit spicy?  Yes please!  My go to for a nice spicy fried.  The veggies are fresh, the food is cheap, and they stuff it to the brim.  I always order it a little bit spicy, yes I say those exact words!  If you say spicy - watch out!  Believe me it's too much, and I love sweat dripping off your forehead kind of spice.  The veggie fried rice is the only thing that I can comment on, because it's the only thing I have ever ordered from this place.  It's a total dive - but I kinda love places like these.  Definitely check it out if you are in the area.  But give yourself some time to order and pick up.  They are always busy, and wait time is minimum 25 minutes.  This is definitely not fast food Chinese..."}
