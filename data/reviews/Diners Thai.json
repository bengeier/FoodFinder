{"text":"Pad thai was very bland and greasy.  Basil chicken had very little chicken and the vegetables were all way overcooked.  Delivery took over an hour."}
{"text":"Is there a star for -1 or a score lower than 1 or zero!?! My God this is the 2nd time we ordered from this place. 1st time they can't get my address right AND my credit card number but the food was decent so we decided to give it another go. 2nd time ordering as I write this review. I called at 7:24PM and it is now 9:11PM and my food is not here yet. They said that the food will be here in 45 minutes to 1 hr. I called the restaurant 2 times and was upset but the lady on the other line did not even say \"I'm sorry\" or \"We want to make up for this poor experience..\" NOTHING! What angered me more is her saying \"HOLD ON PLEASE\" and dropping the phone like a hot potato. During the 1st follow-up call at 9:15pm, she said that the driver is running late because of the weather and will be at my place in a few minutes. Ok IT IS NOT EVEN SNOWING OUTSIDE!!!! plus I live like 11mins away (according to Google Maps with current traffic). No apology. 2nd follow-up call at 9:11PM the lady said \"hold on please\" and after talking to someone on the background in another language said I'll call you back. And I was like \"how can you call me back you didn't even get my number?\" She was like \"oh yes, what's your number?\" 

PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT THIS LOCAL BUSINESS! POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE PLUS POOR COMMUNICATION SKILLS! MAKES YOU WAIT FOREVER FOR YOUR FOOD! Train your front line people to SPEAK PROPER ENGLISH. We are in Canada. You need to learn English."}
{"text":"The name may not sound like much but the food at Diners Thai is tasty!
My favourite item is the panang gai (red curry chicken) dish. It's both hearty and flavourful. My hubby tried the appetizer tasting platter. So amazing, tons of selection. 
The atmosphere is nice, neutral decor.
There's a very efficient and friendly server that I've seen ther a few times now.
I like it."}
{"text":"After my complaint they got investigated and had their green pass revoked. This place made me sick and I would not suggest anyone to go out here."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through just-eat.ca. had a few hiccoughs because they originally rejected my order but once that was done the food was great. delivery was a bit slow though but that might have been just the time of day/driver."}
{"text":"This review is for delivery only, as I've never actually been to Diner's Thai. They have really good food for a decent price, and my first experience with them was excellent.

Since then I've still received a good order each time, with a couple of exceptions. Once the chicken in my Mango Chicken seemed rubbery, and the Pad Thai does taste a little too salty/ketchupy.  It's not the best Thai I've had, but when I'm hungry and want something delivered quickly, Diner's Thai does the trick.

And speaking of quick, they have been extremely prompt with their delivery, sometimes showing up way ahead than when I was quoted over the phone (i.e.: last delivery was twenty-five minutes, and they quoted an hour on the phone).

To conclude, their menu is still in my take-out drawer and I don't have any intention of tossing it. If you're looking for something different, I would recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I agree with Jennifer D. on this one. The customer service is pretty horrendous. While I did not find a hair in my food (thank christ) I did experience attitude.
Back when I didn't know there was decent Thai in my neighbourhood, I ordered take out from Diners Thai. They were continuously omitting my orders of rice that came with the meal. The first time I just ignored it. Probably just a misunderstanding. The second time I called the restaurant. When inquired, they asked why I would want extra rice if I ordered coconut rice. Uhh..because I paid for it, perhaps. Or maybe because there are TWO of us eating. 
Come on, really?  
How cheap.
Needless to say, I stopped ordering from them."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly delicious!  The food was incredibly tasty and of high quality given the price.  Dishes are around $8-12.  And they're quite big!  I had one of the beef dishes, and the meat was unexpectedly tender, the portions generous, and the taste incredible.  The spring rolls were yummy as well, and not too greasy.  This place loses a star for its ambience/setting though...its not exactly the most beautiful resto, and there was a funky scent around (might have just been snow from people's boots).  But if you want great food for cheap, this place is perfect!"}
{"text":"This is what happens when you fail to use Yelp.  One of the worst customer service AND dining experiences I've had, ever. 

The server came over to take our order, and I asked if there were any dishes available that didn't include rice.  \"Well, you can just not eat it.\" She said, nonchalantly.  \"Well, I'm trying to eat healthfully. Can I exchange the tofu for chicken on this one?\" I said, pointing to Combo F.  My friend had ordered a chicken dish and asked for them to remove the chicken, so I asked if she could add it to my dish.  \"I can't do that, I'd have to charge you another $2\".   So, on her advice I ordered the mango chicken.  When I asked for coffee, she said \"The machine's broken\" and failed to offer an alternate choice.

Just a purely shit attitude which said to me \"I hate you and wish you were dead.\"

The food took forever to come out, and we were extremely hungry.  My \"chicken\" was spongy and fried.  It was impossible to tell what it really was, and it tasted like breaded-fried bread.  

After what seemed like an eternity, she arrived at our table and asked \"How was everything?\"   I said \"Frankly it was terrible. Just terrible.\"  She said nothing and walked away.

I can't remember the last time I spoke up about my dining experience to the wait staff.  This is something that I've done maybe 2 or 3 times IN MY ENTIRE LIFETIME.  That's how f'ing bad this place is.

On the way out I walked up to her and asked why she didn't care to ask why my meal was so dreadful. Her flippant response was \"So why didn't like like your meal?\" and included 12 sides of attitude.

The answer is that she didn't give a flying fuck. This place should be shut down."}
{"text":"Very cheap prices and decent service. The unique Malaysian food choices were awesome and spicy. Give it a go!"}
{"text":"Delicious curries (golden and thick)!!! I've only ordered delivery but have been impressed every time!!"}
