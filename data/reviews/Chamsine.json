{"text":"Amazing food at an even better price, really nice staff. This place is one of my favourite spots on St Clair, so definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I love Chamsine so much. Everyone who works there always seems really happy, the food is delicious and fresh, the portions are generous, the prices are a steal, lots of options, easy to customize your meal, and they are very knowledgeable of various dietary restrictions. The falafel plate (which actually fills TWO plates) with an order of the hearty lentil soup is maybe the best value vegan meal you can get in Toronto for $10, and it will feed you all day. In terms of the restaurant itself, they keep it really simple and clean. Most people get take-out."}
{"text":"It was not a busy day, when me and my boyfriend saw this shawarma restaurant and that's the first time we visited that place, so obviously we are not familliar with the menu. We were asking what comes with a certain dish and the cook told us that we should know what to order before we line up. He was being rude to us for no apparent reason. I'm never going back to this restaurant again because of their bad customer service."}
{"text":"This place has by far the best falafel I've ever encountered (and as a vegetarian, I've eaten a lot of falafel). I used to think falafel was always dry and meh until I ordered Chamsine's. It's so tasty and has a moist, fresh texture, not dry at all. Delicious!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here on our way to a dessert shop and were so happy we did.   We ordered the chicken shawarma over fries, it was quick, it was hot, and it was so delicious.   Not only was the food amazing, the two gentlemen working on a Saturday night (tonight) were very friendly and bubbly and just genuine. After coming from the Jamaican restaurant nearby were the staff was not very nice, it was refreshing.   I was going to rate this 4 stars but when I rethought my decision, the only complaint I had was that the tables were dirty and the lights were way too bright lol. So, I settled on 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This is a needle in a haystack find. I LOVE this place. If only I lived closer. The food is AMAZING. The prices are crazy affordable. The food is DELICIOUS and healthy. The staff are SUPERBLY fast and friendly. The portions are HUGE. Choose from Shawarma chicken, beef, salad, kabab, shish taouk, falafal, vegetables, salad, lentil soup, taboula, zaatar and delicious fries laden with wait for it...pomegranate sauce, tahini sauce and so much more that make you want to dive in head first and lick your fingers at the end. Sweet divine its scrumptious. I was lucky enough to find it in December  2017 when they just opened, its owners are Syrian and the love of their culture and food is shared daily. These guys deserve every bit of the success they are experiencing. Go - go - go. Its worth the trip, its worth the effort. Going to this place warms my heart and my belly. What a wonderful addition to the area."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem! We always order delivery and it comes so quickly and so fresh. The falafel plate is such a fantastic deal. Last time I got some sauteed veggies with my shwarma plate and they were so flavorful. We need to keep this place in our neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Woooowwwwwwwww!! We just went to Chamsine for lunch and everything we ate was amazing. When you order a plate it comes piled high with tons of salads, delicious rice and meat or falafel. Every bite is different as you mix together the sauces with all of the different elements of the plate.   The falafel is cooked on the spot and was one of the most tender/crispy, moist and flavourful falafels any of us had ever tried.  The shish taouk chicken was unreal too - moist, a good amount of char, and a great serving for the price! The soup is really delicious and warming as well - perfect to warm up on a wintery day.   We left full and satisfied, with tons of leftovers. We're itching to go back! Everything about this place is great: price, location, service with a smile, generous servings, and FLAVOUR. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Wrap and a pop, with falafel fried to order for 6$? Holy moly yes yes yes.  The shawarma isn't as good as Shawarma Q further east, but that will set you back another three bucks."}
