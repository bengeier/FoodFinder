{"text":"Pretty tacky place but gotta love a rooftop?! Food was pretty gross American Mexican food. My taco salad was just like what you'd get at Eddie's under Towers. At least corn tortillas were an option for a taco, though. The margaritas tasted like jolly ranchers but my mimosa had a generous champagne to oj ratio. I'd go back to hang out on the roof.."}
{"text":"One of the best burritos I have ever had! De Muerte was great. Nice wait staff. Good beer selection. Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"This was my message to the manager..I wanted to message whomever and tell you that your food is excellent. The service on the other hand is not. I am not one to complain and I will make this brief. My boyfriend and I went to your establishment around 10 pm Saturday night. We were seated by the hostess table and sat there for quite a while. I looked, made eye contact, and smiled at a server but after watching her walk by us four times I realized she wasn't our server. While waiting to get her attention prior to ordering many other tables were sat. The server eventually came over and asked what we would like to order. This server was indeed the same girl that I attempting to get service from initially. She apologized and was happy to take our order. I ordered queso, a pollo burrito without pico and and a yinzarita. She promptly came back with the queso and informed me that it was going to be about 15 minutes to make my drink. She then asked if I wanted something else. I said no and that I would wait.  There were three females who also ordered yinzaritas. I know they were seated after us because I thought about asking to be moved to that table. We got our food and I still had not received my drink. The server did come over once more and tell me it would be a few more minutes. I had pretty much finished my food and I realized the girls at the other table were all sipping yinzaritas. After a few minutes the server came back again, said it would only be a few more minutes and I asked her to just cancel my order.  I mentioned the girls having their drinks to my boyfriend and he (being passive as always) said, yeah, I was hoping you didn't notice that. I didn't ask for a manager or complain to the server I just wanted out of the restaurant. That was the second time eating at Steel Cactus and we had issues with rude staff before. The manager was more than polite but it doesn't make up for a bad experience. We will not be coming back to your restaurant. I hope eventually, you get either new staff or retraining needs to be implemented. I will be telling my friends about my poor experience and the few people I've already told have then told me their bad experiences with your restaurant. Good luck, with your reputation because its going downhill fast."}
{"text":"It is about time the bar be raised on Carson Street - Steel Cactus you set the standard high!  You are a triple threat with your beautiful establishment, your delicious food, and your unbeatable staff!  I cannot say enough good things about you!  Keep up the great work, I can only see great things happening in your future. Thank you for a great time and I look forward to next time!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place more stars but I cannot. Walked in to beautiful decor. First impression of appearance was positive. We sat at one of the bar tables, my best friend, her husband, my boyfriend, and myself so that they could watch the March Madness game on a Sunday evening. Initially, there was a decent crowd with probably 75% restaurant tables full and 60% of the bar area. Our Server was friendly but that's about it. We ordered 2 dip trios, which comes with salsa, quac, and queso. Queso was cold on both of our plates and we we're only given one basket of chips. We he came back to check on us 10 mins later, we requested that he heat up our existing queso and bring us our 2nd basket of chips. He replied with \"yeah that wasn't my decision\" and walked away... what wasn't your decision? We ordered two appetizers and we need the other half of one of these... and just please microwave our queso please! So anyways, he comes back with new queso......still cold. We complain, he says \"yeah you're actually not the first person to complain about it today\" and leaves again. Just clearly not getting it. We end up getting one new decent queso to split between the four of us. Onto entrees. We waited forever. My friends have been there before, in addition to the Shadyside location. They always get the same thing. My friends salad had been sitting in the window long enough for the cheese to not only melt, but harden into a solid chunk of cheese. Her husband's 412 burrito, which the primary ingredient is steak, came without one spec of meat. My boyfriend was too hungry to care but he said his fajitas weren't great but weren't terrible. My steak nachos were cold and very skimpy. I've had bigger portions from Taco Bell. The manager came over and sent back the burrito and my nachos for remakes. When our meals come out they are still sub par. Only 5 tiny pieces of meat in the $12 burrito and my nachos were edible but with cold queso, yet again, I could barely eat half. The manager, Jake was kind enough to comp our meal which we appreciated because I've never had such a terrible dining experience. He seemed overwhelmed and frustrated with the staff. Ultimately, we were there for almost 3 hours waiting on terrible food. Also, we all felt really sick the next day. So whether it was bad quality or they messed with our food, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is just awful and over priced.  It is well decorated and feels upscale, but don't be fooled.  the overpriced food has no flavor.  My wife and I went to lunch here today, paid $45 and we didn't even get drinks.  Wish I had my money back."}
{"text":"To me, Steel Cactus is about a fun place to meet up with friends!  There's plenty of seating and a large deck, so it's perfect for sitting around and chatting over drinks.  Catch their happy hour, which doesn't end till 7pm.  Nibble on whatever their daily special is.  Enjoy the lively atmosphere, and possibly use their photobooth, tucked away by the bathrooms.    The food was just ok and the margarita very \"from-a-mix\" tasting, which is the main reason I'm giving 3 stars.  Generic mexican food, nothing special.  (I'm pretty biased and picky about mexican food.  Usually, I'll reserve mexican food for trips back to Texas or California.).  But again, I stress that this would probably only be a place I go for casual meet ups over drinks.  Don't be expecting the most authentic best tasting mexican fare.  Service is pretty good, considering the high pace/bar atmosphere.  The bartenders are always hustling around during happy hour, so they're very quick and no-nonsense.  But definitely not rude.  The last time I was in, there were a few credit card technical difficulties and also some order mixups, but they were handled very quickly and the bartender was very apologetic."}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  The skinny margarita was solid.  Quesadillas were just ok. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"If you get a margarita go ahead and buy two shots of tequila for it as well. That way at least there will be 2 shots... It'll come out to about $24 for some limeade and added tequila."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 10 for a Friday happy hour (runs until 7; half priced apps and a few dollars off the specialty drinks). Excellent, attentive, friendly service and mediocre Mexican. For example, the traditional quac has cucumbers in it - strange, and bland."}
{"text":"I used to rave about this place for their happy hour. I think they've limited their happy hour menu now, but regardless, one thing must be said: their water is horrendous. Every place in Pittsburgh has very normal tasting water (as in, it doesn't taste like anything). For some reason, every time I have been here, the water is undrinkable. So it must be said that every piece of ice that goes into your margarita is coming from the same place. For that reason alone, AVOID."}
{"text":"Overall, OK experience and the food was OK.  I would go again in a pinch but I am sure there are better Mexican places in the area.    We Sat at the bar for dinner and drinks.  The person with me ordered the carnitas nachos and a house margarita.  I had a order of the picante guacamole, the Mexican street corn and two build your own tacos.  (It was Tuesday and Happy Hour).  The nachos were OK.  The quest they used was kinda thin and watery, so chips were a soggy mess within 20 min.  My tacos were good - grilled chicken with some fixings.  The Guacamole was also good - smooth with pieces of jalape√±o on top.   I would order everything again EXCEPT for the Mexican street corn which was clearly frozen corn on the cob from Costco.... the flavors with the dressings on the corn were fine. It the corn itself was clearly boiled and soft and not fresh AT ALL.  It was actually kind of gross.    Overall, I would go again, but definitely avoid the Mexican street corn at all costs unless they decide to start using fresh corn.  OR they make it a seasonal appetizer for when corn is in season."}
{"text":"Typical Mexican style food- appetizers ok. Speciality tacos made the visit though- recommend the brisket tacos and the chorizo tacos."}
{"text":"Montana (our server today) is the bomb!!!( ...even though she's never been to Montana)  love the guac, the margs... Steel Cactus and Montana has ours hearts"}
{"text":"Terrible food, weak drinks,  poor service, basically the bane of Walnut Street. Better suited for Southside or Station Square."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but I had to give these guys a shout out. Visiting pgh with some friends we went out for the night on Carson st. Steel Cactus looked cool so we went in for dinner. Our dinner turned into 2hrs cause we didn't want to go. The food was really good but even if it wasn't I would still go back. Our server, Jane, was awesome. The way the staff all the way to the mgr, Kelly?,  interacted with each other and the customers really makes the difference. You can see they genuinely enjoy the job and the customers. It wasn't the fake smiles and \"how can I help you\" that you usually get at places. We left our cc so we had to go back and ended up staying until the bar closed. All the places on Carson but these guys get it."}
{"text":"I felt compelled to write after I had dinner at this new place in the middle of the week with my wife. I usually don't rate places online! In few word: Disappointing, if you are going for the food. OK if you are going to sit at the bar"}
{"text":"More like a 2.8 but I will be a half glass full kinda guy on this November day.    Happy hour was nearing its end  so I chose to  go with a yinzerita (still have no idea what was in it but assume  it had Margarita characteristics with an Appalachian accent )  It tasted a bit watered down but I like the look of the Corona stuck in it 10:30 angle style,,,, had the pulled chicken Taquitoes (spell?)  which were average at best but I was starved from my drunken walkabout.    Service was aloof and borderline arrogant.  Crowd was 20 something crew so at least I know I wouldn't be stabbed or puked on at 6:45pm  I am not really sure why I went with a 2.8 but I did.  :O"}
{"text":"Worst tacos I have ever had! Strange for a place that specializes in Mexican food. Food server smelled too."}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday night and had a blast. The drinks were good and the music was great. The table was not cleaned after they cleared it, it was disgustingly sticky. But I had an overall good time there and decided to go back Sunday night for a drink. This time we ordered an appetizer because there was four of us. We got the nachos with ground beef thinking of would be enough to share. Nope, the nachos could have fed about two and they weren't really good. The cheese was hard and the little bit of ground beef we did get was all clumped up. On top of all that it was pretty chilly out and they had all the windows open. There weren't many customers so we asked if they could close the window and she said she would ask. It took about 20 minutes for her to come back and say a bartender had to close it but by then we already made up our minds to leave because our service was not great on this particular night. We just paid the tab and left and not exactly sure if I will be returning even though I really enjoyed Saturday night despite the dirty table."}
{"text":"Decent food and drinks here.  I am a fan of the guacamole, shrimp tacos and fajita salad.  Margaritas are decent enough.  Have yet to try a \"yinzerita.\"  Atmosphere is also decent depending on what time you are there and what you are looking for.  Music selection always makes me laugh - it is quite an eclectic mix sometimes.  One night, there were 8 Frank Sinatra songs in a row that then transitioned into a few country tunes before sliding into pop music for the rest of the time I was there.  There is always something for everyone.  I haven't been for brunch, but I have heard that it is absolutely amazing - on my to do list to try it out myself!  Overall, a great place for a good meal or even just a drink."}
{"text":"Came to South Side location once, food was average at best.  Figure I'll give them another chance because I enjoy the Shadyside location.   Walk in with a date and hostess tells us there is a 30 minute wait. No problem (gave her my number to call when table opened and go to the upstairs bar for a drink).   Twenty minutes passes, hostess comes up, and seats a couple groups who were most likely on the seating list before us (no worries).  Forty minutes passes, no phone call, no problem (it's Friday, I'm sure there are others waiting).  An hour passes and I figure it's time to go check the waiting list. On our way down the steps, the original hostess comes walking back up with a couple I know for a fact were not ahead of us.  Arrive back at the front entrance and ask the other hostess why I hadn't gotten a call yet. Give her my name/number... \"Oh, it looks like your number was never submitted\".   Turn to leave, original hostess comes prancing to the front door with a huge grin on her face and doesn't even acknowledge us.   Step it up guys.   Average food, overpriced drinks, and terrible service. Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"Their chips are horrible and they sprinkle some spice on them in an uneven pattern. One chip will taste like saw dust and one is covered in chili powder. They should use tostidos. The atmosphere is nice but the salsa is bland and the chips are horrible. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and loved the atmosphere. The upper deck with the roof that opens is awesome. Not a crazy beer selection."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and was skeptical but had a great meal and a fantastic, attentive server."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is the best, especially at happy hour (between 5p-7p). Taco Tuesday = $2.50 tacos. Happy Hour = 1/2 priced appetizers, $5 house margaritas, $7 yinzer margaritas  (recommend the strawberry margarita with summer shandy, just like a fizzy strawberry lemonade)."}
{"text":"Waitress got my order wrong, sub par food. The building is great for summer. However they sat us upstairs where there is no roof and it was 45 degrees out! It was freezing."}
{"text":"I've never felt more disrespected in my life. The security guard outside of the restaurant was rude, inappropriate and incredibly racist and I will never return to this restaurant again. I hope you don't support this behavior either."}
{"text":"Love Steel Cactus! We definitely be back again soon! The upstairs patio is very nice and open. It has cool lights and good music. Food service can be a bit slow but it is worth the wait! This location is much better than the Shadyside location! South Side is the perfect location to grab a bite here and then go shopping!"}
{"text":"I've been to the North Shore location more than once and always leave with an overall sense of less than average service/food. Out of all the North Shore destinations, I probably wouldn't rank this very highly compared to Local Brewhouse/Burgatory/The Foundry. Once was here enjoying a beer at 8:30 and they closed at 9:00 pm despite posted hours being 10 pm. I would not make a point to visit this location at the North Shore. Shadyside and Southside locations are much nicer in terms of service and atmosphere.    UPDATE 7/27 ****** Visited the North Shore location again to try it out, and see if anything has changed. Sat at a table for 20 minutes, then left with no service. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place must still be going through a rough start. I ordered a tequila on the menu that the bartender \"couldn't find.\" On the second try, the tonic was flat, and even after asking about it, wasn't offered a new drink. Finally, I watched as she blew her nose into a tiny beverage napkin, and without washing her hands, continued to make drinks, serve food, and hand out silverware. Yikes!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worst restaurants. Horribly slow service, disgusting and watered down drinks. Bad food period. Why is it that this restaurant group has bad food at every single one of its restaurants. Decor is nice which makes it such a shame."}
{"text":"First of all, I love Mexican food and Mexican restaurants - authentic or generic. The vibe in any Mexican restaurant is always fun. I've been to the location in the Southside before a pens game and had a pretty good time!  I was anxious to get my hands on another lime yinzerita(lime margarita with a corona beer bottle added in the mix). However, we were seated within seconds of arriving but we sat and waited at our table for 10 minutes with no service. Three waitresses walked past our table many times and they made many glances but no one ended up acknowledging us. Total bummer. We decided to leave. Maybe another time, maybe not. Would love to recommend but do not at this time."}
{"text":"Honestly, fuck this place. Service is horrible. Wait times are atrocious. I just wanted to have some margs and queso with friends. Not wait 6 centuries to have our waitress bring the wrong order.   The scene is great and location second to none. With that being said, service and general attitude of staff completely negates any potential this place has.  Do yourself a favor, don't waste your fucking time. You're going to be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful inside! The service was amazing, we stopped in for lunch to find out that they have brunch. The French toast was great, and Amy was our waitress who was fast and attentive. We will be back! Also they have a bloody Mary bar, can you say win win!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a few hours to kill for dinner before a movie.  We were going to grab a beer and food at Fat Heads however, the wait at Fat Head's was long per usual.  We were seated right away as there were three hostesses however we were not greeted yet alone offered drinks by anyone for about 12 minutes.   When the server finally came over, she was disconnected and unfriendly. Ordering food was equally as painful a process.  We watched uncomfortably as one of the hostesses asked a table of two whom were completing their meal if they could move them upstairs because there was a misunderstanding with the number of people needed for a reservation.    Overall the food and atmosphere were fine however the service was unprofessional, misguided, rushed and frankly impersonable."}
{"text":"They called & CANCELLED my reservation 10 minutes before we were scheduled to sit down. They were extremely unhelpful when I tried to see if there were other options (such as splitting up the group). This put out our whole group & we were left wandering around trying to find a place to eat on a Saturday night (good luck with that ..) I've never had someone cancel a reservation before .. if you can't take the group, then don't take the reservation."}
{"text":"I had some family visiting from out of town and we decided to try this place on a whim based on some other good reviews.  We stopped in for lunch on a Thursday and since it was such a warm, beautiful day they had all the windows and doors open so it really felt open and inviting in the restaurant.  Loved all of the decorations; day of the dead masks, HUGE neon cactus in the middle of the bar, pointed star lights, exposed wooden walls and enormous murals all added to the fun and kitschy ambience.    Since it was a quiet lunch hour our server was super attentive (not in your face kinda way-but genuine).  We ordered guacamole and gringo salsa (would have tried something hotter but when you're traveling with lightweights who's tongues light on fire by just smelling tobasco and the like-you take it easy on them).  Guacamole was OK, salsa was OK-HAVE TO SAY, NEVER HAD TO PAY FOR REGULAR SALSA AT ANY TEX-MEX OR MEXICAN RESTAURANT...and I lived in LA for over 10 years...just saying this should probably be standard fare.  Taco salad with chipotle ranch was delicious, dressing was spicy and plentiful.  Carne soft tacos were tender and flavorful as were black beans and rice.  My kids enjoyed their chicken burrito immensely too.    House margaritas-I recommend getting them with lemon and lime juice and forgoing sweet/sour mix which is usually overly sweet for me.    Overall a good experience, good food, service and setting.  Yet another place that makes me love the South Side!"}
{"text":"Recently ordered takeout from here. Over the phone we ordered 3 types of tacos. After ordering, I specifically said to the person helping me, \"Please let the chef know that I am allergic to shellfish. There can be no cross contamination.\" She said, \"Of course, I will let them know.\" When we got home with our meals, I opened the first box, grabbed the taco and put it on my plate. Instead of being the mahi taco that we ordered, it was a taco full of shrimp. If I had taken a bite of this taco I could have had an anaphylactic reaction. Thankfully, I saw that it looked different and immediately put it back in the box. I am very disappointed that they not only got my order wrong, but also put my life in danger."}
{"text":"Food was just okay. Service was extremely slow - it was a Thursday night but the restaurant was not overly busy. If you're looking for great Mexican, I'd say pass."}
{"text":"Their food is ok. Personally I think that el patron in monroeville has the best Mexican food in the area. Their drinks are reasonably priced. For a Fri or Saturday in shadyside, this is the new place to be. It has a lot of space and a roof top bar. It depends who else is around to make up the atmosphere. There were a lot of cmu students who.just finished their mbas there. They were moody and rude to the bar tenders."}
{"text":"We came back a few weeks ago,I forgot to post as promised to my favorite waiter josh! I brought my husband,daughter and her bf,they loved it,we gave him a heads up we were coming and he had our drinks,quesno and chips brought out immediately, talk about top service,he was quick with drinks and orders and helped our guests with recommend actions,awesome service as usual...and the honor Groupon certificates when available with no hassle,its my go to favorite place,watched their chef on pgh2day on Tuesday this week,live the new concept of root beer pot roast tacos,and I really want to try the mango/mango yinzerita next time,also wish they would sell t-shirts,I always recommend steel cautus to anyone wanting Mexican,great authentic food and down to earth service,actually have plans soon to have josh to our house for Hubby's famous wings soon...keep up the great job josh and crew!!!!cannot wait til the roof is open on a warm summer evening.....hopefully see ya on cina de Maya!!!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre; edible but lacked flavor.  Wait staff was ok. Atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"Went here for drinks for one night. They called last call and 5 minutes later they kicked everyone out, making my friend chug her beer. And meanwhile it wasn't closing time yet. Very crappy service."}
{"text":"The waiter was great, however the food sucked so bad.   The tacos were cold, and the stuffed pepper my friend got resembled hospital food.   Also, the tea tastes like mop water. I feel bad for any server that works there. The food is just so awful."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Steel Cactus.  The decor is really nice, it has a great semi-open bar with a nice view of Walnut Street.  And... that's about all it has going for it.  When I walked in the hostess was nowhere to be found so I seated myself at the bar.  The bartender very begrudgingly took my order, and about 15 minutes later I was treated to 3 very bland tacos.  They were only served with raw onions and cilantro.  No tomatoes, sour cream, cheese, or any sides.  Way overpriced and underwhelming.  Such a shame, it seemed so nice!"}
{"text":"I would not call this place great by any means, but the food came out quickly when I visited and my server was always where I needed them to be. The food lacks in flavor and the margaritas are way to sweet, but it isn't bad by any means. I think it is as close to my definition of 3 stars as you can get - totally passable and utterly forgettable."}
{"text":"This place sucks! Literally the worst food I've paid for in the 26 years I've been on this earth. Skip this place - anywhere is better. Trust me."}
{"text":"Just came back from Steel Cactus and was so disappointed, I've been moved to write a rare Yelp review. Atmosphere is loud and raucous, acoustics are bad, but some people like that. No complaints there.   Biggest complaint - the food is HORRIBLE. Like almost inedible horrible. The seasonings were either total overload or totally lacking. I feel sick already. Neither my bf or I could finish our plates. What a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Food was good.  The service was bad.  It wasn't busy.  It took 20 mins from the time we sat down to get our drinks.  We ordered soup, nachos & entrees.  They all came out at the same time. Oh that's not true, the waiter forgot the soups.  Nice atmosphere.  I'll go again with crossed fingers."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice but steer clear of the food and drinks. My friend ordered a mojito and the basil in the mojito was brown and wilting! As a \"bartender\" how do you serve something like this to your customers?? Do you not even look at the product that you are making for someone? It gets better (or worse!) The queso dip with chorizo was horrible. The chips were stale tasting with tons of seasoning on them. The queso tasted like cardboard and the chorizo-um three little chunks of chorizo?! I hardly call that queso AND chorizo dip. Tacos were on special that night and I was highly unimpressed with them. I could make a dozen tacos at home with a higher quality of ingredients for the cost that I spent on two tacos here. Service was sparse and somewhat scattered."}
{"text":"Great patio and service, but the food is pretty bad. It's hard to mess up guacamole, and they even managed to do that. Come for a drink, but go somewhere else for dinner"}
{"text":"The East Carson and Walnut St. locations consistently try to kick me out for being \"underage.\" I am 22, almost 23, and do not appreciate this. Steel Cactus, please trust in you bouncers more. I do not want to go through 3 levels of ID checking just to sip on a good drink and eat a burrito. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Nice lunch today while visiting the South Side.  Our server Hannah took great care of us.   Tacos, chips, salsa and queso were very good.  Margaritas hit the spot.   We'll be back."}
{"text":"I had huevos rancheros, I kinda felt like it was cafeteria food with eggs made from powder and potatoes with peppers that were probably sitting in the kitchen in a pan all morning (mushy). The bloody marys had zero...zero flavor. I might come back for dinner or drinks but brunch is no bueno."}
{"text":"Came for some drinks and the atmosphere and drinks were great. Brie was my server and she was overall great. Very quick with drinks and super sweet. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The event planning is horrific. Do not ruin your event by booking here. Beyond unprofessional."}
{"text":"Food sucked I thought. Nachos were good but that's hard to screw up. Maybe it was an off night for them but I won't be back anytime soon if ever again"}
{"text":"Steel Cactus gets two stars for their rooftop deck.  It's a nice place to hang out on warm days.  I've gotten food here numerous times and have had several bad experiences with food of questionable freshness, so now I basically just go for drinks from time to time.  With that being said I find their margaritas to be overpriced for what they are, even on happy hour special.  Their other mixed drinks are decent and are about 7 bucks.  Their happy hour deals on wine and beer are okay, but the selection marginal.  All in all, I go back because of the rooftop deck, and in truth, they probably have one of the best set-ups in Shadyside to kick back and meet up with friends.  If only the food/drinks matched the atmosphere."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped here for dinner. We were promptly seated on the balcony. Then we waited. And waited. After approximately fifteen minutes a member of the wait staff stumbled across our table. We ordered chips and salsa, two glasses of water, and a margarita. The water was delivered in short order. The chips and salsa followed ten minutes later. After another fifteen minutes I reminded the waiter that the margarita had not been provided. Within five minutes the margarita arrived. We were seated more than an hour ago. We're still waiting for our meals.   To be continued."}
{"text":"I have Pirates' season tickets, and this is my go-to for per game food and drinks. The staff is great and I've never had a bad meal here. I highly recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"Oh Steel Cactus, where do I start?    When we walked in for an early dinner this place was pretty empty. Even though it was so empty there were a good 15-20 staff members just hanging around. Some were at the bar, five or six were at the hostess stand and still more were standing around outside of the kitchen. I have never seen so many employees in such a small restaurant. When one of the hostess' finally decided that she was going to seat us we asked for a booth. It took three more requests before she actually seated us at a booth though. She tried to sit us on the deck (it was about to storm, really?) and then she tried to sit us at a table and then she tried to sit us at another table. So finally, we got a booth. The table was sticky and greasy and so were the menus.   We ordered the appetizer trio where you can pick three dips to order. We got the guacamole, queso and pineapple salsa. It was lackluster to say the least. When I was a kid my sisters and I would cook for our family once a week. We really young so often times our meals were pretty much inedible but our parents were good sports and ate the terrible food we provided. The queso dip at Steel Cactus reminds me of a particularly disgusting concoction my sister created that consisted of salsa and Kraft cheese slices melted in a bowl to make spicy cheese dip. It was plasticy, tasteless and seemed solid as a rock. the guacamole was tasteless and generally disappointing. It had giant (I mean like a third of an avocado) chunks of avocado in it. The pineapple salsa was interesting. It tasted exactly like pineapple, which would maybe be interesting if they got different chips to go with it. The chips. Let's talk about those for a second. It seemed to me that somebody took normal chips and gave them a salt rub. They were not good unless you are into super salty chips..   Our main courses were OK. I had the San Jose burrito. Our waiter, who genuinely seemed to be a really nice guy and was a good waiter, said that people love the San Jose sauce. Love it! I did not love it. It tasted like they take unripened tomato and mash it up. I'm not a huge tomato person to begin with. Luckily the San Jose sauce was on the side so I was able to just abandon it.  The chicken in my burrito was acceptable and even varied to the good side of things. The rice in my burrito was salty, very salty, and I would get a bite every once in a while that had rice that was undercooked. The ride had litter flavor. the menu said it was cilantro rice in the burrito so I thought GREAT! It'll be like Chipotle rice. WRONG! No flavor at all and I'm not even sure I tasted cilantro in any of the dishes I tried. Everything just tasted like salt. Speaking of salty, let's talk about the salt content at this place.    I don't really cook with salt. I don't use a lot of salt. It's just not a flavor that I find appealing. Steel Cactus loves salt. Everything I had there was slathered in it. The chips practically had a shell made of salt. The chicken was salty, the rice was extremely salty.  I felt like a rabbit with a salt block. Honestly, I went through a few glasses of water with dinner and it wasn't because the food was spicy (which is normally why I would drink so much water at a Mexican restaurant), it was because I was trying to flush the salt out of my system.   The service was OK. Our waiter was really very nice and he was very attentive but not hovering too closely over us.  Random members of the staff would flutter by from time to time because there really weren't enough customers to justify so many staff members being there.   Let's take a minute and talk about the bathroom. It was OK, clean enough but the thing that really pushed me over the greasy tabled edge into hysterical laughter was the sign in the bathroom asking patrons to please hold the lever down until the \"toilette\" had flushed completely. Really? Toilette? If you need to have a sign up asking people to hold the lever down, you are not a nice enough restaurant to throw extra letters onto the word toilet.    My favorite thing about this whole experience was that they gave us a customer loyalty card. Yep, because I definitely want to come back and have my sodium intake for the year again!  I will just say this, I have always considered the Shadyside area to be sort of a college hangout. So if I were still in college and had consumed a lot of alcohol, the Steel Cactus would be the perfect place to go soak up some of the booze in my stomach with salty burritos and plastic queso dip."}
{"text":"The bartender,Shannon, was amazing. She was very friendly, and helpful when making decisions about drinks/ the menu. Great conversations. The food was awesome too. We got the queso to start and de meurte burrito. Sit at the bar and ask for Shannon when you go!"}
{"text":"In general, meh.  The Mexican fare is average at best, and if it wasn't for the lure of the gimmicky yet pretty tasty \"Yinzeritas\" I'm not sure I would even give the place 3 stars.  It's decent enough for a happy hour when you're getting drinks and chips and dip, or even just to get drinks, but I wouldn't recommend the place if you're looking for a great Mexican dining experience, or great dining experience in general."}
{"text":"I brought a large group here yesterday and it was wonderful. My table was ready at the time of my reservation and our server, Dustin, was great. He even split the bills perfectly on the first try! We were celebrating, so not the easiest table, but our food and drinks were great and I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I love this place. Three words: beer cheese queso. Good bar, great salsas, and beer cheese queso. Yeah, they have other food. But seriously, beer cheese queso. We order the smothered chicken burrito (guess what we smother it in...). Even the soup is good! I suspect they put the queso in it. Delicious and staff are super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food I've ever had. Seriously, do not waste your money here. You are welcome!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner because I wanted to go for a beer at the Beerhead bar across the street and they don't serve food. Server came and took my drink order and it took a while for my drink to come out despite a limited amount of customers. Server came back and took my order for a pulled chicken burrito. I waited quite a while when she came out and said she forgot to place my order and asked what I had ordered. I repeated my order and she said she'd put it right in. After a while my food was brought out. It was barely warm. The \"Hot queso cheese sauce\" looked like they had melted a slice of American cheese on top of the burrito about an hour prior.  In cutting the burrito and it's barely warm contents open there was an unidentifiable chunk of black charcoal like material. To top everything, the table was very dirty also. I would not recommend this place with so many other great choices nearby."}
{"text":"Had a great time here before and after the game. Stop in and say hello Melissa. Live music game days. Nice drinks, great atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"The hip modern decor and nice atmosphere drew me inside but the food was nothing special. For a nice looking upscale restaurant, they serve water and sauces in disposable cups and even supply plastic flatware, which I thought seemed out of place. The salsa and queso were way overpriced for the amount you're served in a small plastic ramekin. The tacos were on what seemed like store bought tortillas that were not cooked at all. We went during the Pirates game so there were only two occupied tables in the restaurant with at least 5 servers on duty, but we were still mostly neglected as ours was more interested in socializing with her coworkers and being on her phone at the bar."}
{"text":"What a waste of money.  Unless maybe you're wasted.  I had high hopes considering the novelty of rooftop dining in Pittsburgh. For the price point, the food and service should be a lot better.  The hostesses were rude, refused to sit us in the booth and then immediately sat a couple in a booth right after us.  Server was sweet, but painfully slow and never refilled our water. The cocktails were no where what was described about 10-12 bucks a pop and zero buzz.  A couple that was seated a few minutes after us was finished with their main course 15 minutes before we even go ours.  And when we did it was very disappointing.  The \"guacamole\" was just mashed avocados, no seasoning whatsoever.  The rice was clearly a mix like Zatarans or something and the beans were equally unseasoned and appeared to have been poured out of a can and undrained.  Really gross.  The shrimp in the tacos were well cooked, but it was all downhill from there, no flavor, overcooked veggies and to top off- two really thick and cold corn tortillas for each taco.  Having no flavor is the worst crime against Mexican food. Being slow and rude, the worst crime against service.  Really terrible place."}
{"text":"Horrific bar service. Got there at 8.30PM. Bartender kept saying \"1 min\" and every time she would go away to joke around with the staff while there was plenty of people just wanting to get served."}
{"text":"I love steel cactus for brunch on the weekends. Fun menu and it never seems to be packed like the other spots in Shadyside. Do I need to mention 2 dollar mimosas and a pretty decent Bloody Mary bar?! If the Bloody Mary bar had stuffed olives I would be giving 5 stars. Such a winning spot!"}
{"text":"2 stars for being average. It was nice to sit in the open breeze of the second floor, on a warm afternoon, and have some drinks. I had the 412 salad in a taco shell bowl. Chicken and potato wedges were great, as well as the grilled onions. The huge chunks of romaine were undesirable, and the ranch was probably the worst ranch I've ever had. The chipotle ranch was a bit better, but not impressed. I would classify the food as average, and I would eat here again during the happy hour specials that they have, because it's not worth paying full price. The apps were the best part, check out my pictures of the Mexican sweet corn and chorizo dip... Though the chip to dip ratio is wayyyy off. We thought the frozen margaritas could be a bit more \"frozen\", but they were pretty tasty anyway. Tips:  1) There are few places in Pittsburgh that have nailed  authentic Mexican cuisine, but the ones trying for spin-off food aren't quite there either... And this is one of them.  2)Go to Mad-Mex for flavor, quality, and delicious wannabe Mexican food. After 11 it's half off in Oakland.  3) If Taco Bell sold margaritas, it would put Steel Cactus out of business.  4) Try El Burro Comedor in north side if you want the real stuff.  5) Read Yelp reviews on everything! I don't take my own advice, but I'll learn eventually!"}
{"text":"Not as bad as I thought it was going to be based on other reviews. Sure the service was extremely slow but look at your location people; your downtown and there's usually always an event going on nearby.   The chips and salsa were ok but the chicken quesadilla was actually really good."}
{"text":"OMG is not enough.let me explain.  Meat head bouncer.  You know the guy.  Kinda fat.  Arms with zits.  Didn't graduate anything.   Sad life.  My buddy was physically removed.  It was ugly.  And not necessary as we are all old.    Literally old.  We are in our 40's, doing 40 year things.   I'm sad for the owners and especially the bouncer."}
{"text":"I actually really like their happy hour here. The yinzeritas are my favorite and the food is good. However, the staff is what makes this a 1 Star review. I went about two months ago with a large party that eventually dwindled down to four people. Our waitress was incredibly slow at taking our order and bringing us drinks. Then, when we were ready for our checks, she brought them out incorrectly at least three times. Each time we would tell her what the correct order was, and it would still either be incorrect or incorrectly priced. Now, we all got sick of waiting so we just wrote on the back of a receipt what each order had and how much it would cost. Then she took a long time bringing our checks back, but at least they were correct this time. We ended up spending 40 minutes waiting to pay, because of how slow she was and how many times the checks were incorrect.   I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't recommend anyone else going either."}
{"text":"With so many good taco joints in Pittsburgh these days, it's more and more rare for me to make it to Steel Cactus. I was in the area today and decided to stop for a quick lunch.   Let's get this out of the way first, as far as chips and salsa goes, they lag behind their other Pittsburgh area counterparts. The chips are a little bit thicker than most taquerias and are not my favorite. Neither was the pineapple salsa that I tried today. It lacked any real balance of flavor or much spice.  I decided to build my own chicken flour tacos (Mexican style) and added avocado creme. The chicken was over cooked but had nice spices. The rest of the taco was forgettable including the avocado creme which lacked much flavor. The beans and rice that came with the meal were pretty good however.  Over my many visits here, I've come to realize that this is the place to come to drink. Of all the Mexican joints around they have the overall best drink specials."}
{"text":"I went to Steel Cactus for the first time last night for an event. I had done my research on the place before going, just to see what other patrons thought. When my Mom and I got there, we sat up in the rooftop bar area which was really nice. It was enclosed in glass since it was threatening rain all night. All the other people there for the event had ordered drinks and food, so we decided to do the same.  I was put off a little by how expensive a lot of the dishes were. I wasn't so hungry I wanted a full-out meal but even some of the appetizers were a little high. My mom and I both just ordered some chips and dips. She got the pineapple salsa and I don't think she was too crazy about it. I got the picante guacamole, which while good, was nothing to write home about. We both ordered $2.25 Blue Moons because we didn't want to pay more for drinks. I did notice some other people at this event had those Yinzeritas, which were huge. Not sure how they liked them though.  All in all, would I come back? Maybe for a drink. But the food... I don't know. Sometimes I can be a bit on the cheap side when I go out to eat. I don't normally order stuff over $10-12 unless I know it's going to be good. And based on other reviews, it's probably smart I didn't order a major meal."}
{"text":"I would not recommend going to Steel Cactus, unless you're just having drinks on the rooftop.  I went to dinner with 10 of my friends on Saturday night and we all had an awful experience.  Ambiance - the decor is nice...very modern, clean, and urban though it is quite possibly the loudest restaurant I have been to in Pittsburgh.  Granted it was a Saturday night, but we were forced to scream at one another just in our normal conversations.    Service - given our large party size, we should have had 2 servers, though we had one frazzled and sadly under-trained waitress.  Steel Cactus also doesn't seem to have busboys, which would improve this experience.  It took us about 20 minutes to get drinks - and I'm talking about water and Diet Cokes in addition to margaritas.  Also I ordered a bottle of wine that never came (in fact the server just disappeared and forgot about it altogether)...the only saving grace was that it didn't appear on my bill.   Food/Drinks - half our table liked their margaritas, while several others sent theirs back as they were terrible.  I got a vodka and soda and the soda was flat...and even their beers on tap were flat, so I think they just had issues that night.  I had a carne asada steak, which for $12.50 was a steal, but you could tell that it was old poor quality meat that was graying on the counter prior to it being cooked.  Overall, I wouldn't go back to Steel Cactus as there are better venues with mediocre/good Mexican food and better service and ambiance like Round Corner Cantina or Verde."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews.   But since my horrible experience with ECCO shoes, I've decided to write reviews when I've had a positive experience.  Ate lunch (no Pirate game).  I had the chicken tacos Steel Cactus way with mango habanero sauce.  Spicy but mouth burning.  Really liked the black bean side dish.  Tea was very good which is important to me.  Service was very good.  Great day to sit outside in the shade and people watch."}
{"text":"I've been to Steel Cactus several times since the fall. Host/hostess not friendly or helpful any time. Customers should be \"greeted\" by friendly staff or first impression is lost. Last Saturday we are at the bar. Bar staff didn't smile. Served meals then disappeared! Guacamole was tasteless. Really? In a Mexican restaurant. Cool looking place though."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. Nice setting with old rustic wood bar top. Full bar with a nice draft selection. Jordan was an outstanding bartender- friendly, helpful and attentive. Their bloody marys were good - heavy on the Horse radish just like I like it. We ordered chips and salsa and guacamole. The homemade chips were perfect, the salsa was excellent but there was something missing from the guacamole... Still good but perhaps it needed a bit more salt and cilantro. We filled up on chips & drinks and didn't leave room for dinner. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after the Pirates game the other night. We were exhausted, but the drinks here were so good that we were right back in it. We ordered a couple apps, they were alright, your typical chain texmex . But they were warm and came out fast, so they were still perfect.  The best part of this restaurant is by far the staff. So friendly and totally at your service. The manager, Jake, stopped by multiple times and was so funny. The bartenders knew what we needed before we did, and we ended up staying all night. Definitely check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"As a bar, I think this place is great. Never too crazy and the deck upstairs is fantastic when the weather is nice. I recently went for brunch and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. They have $2 mimosas and a Bloody Mary bar. The food was excellent as well. And the best part was it wasn't crowded at all! Definitely beats waiting in line at Pamela's or Cafe Moulin."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but the food is pretty mediocre. If you want good Mexican food I would recommend going to Condado."}
{"text":"Good spicy chicken nachos. Suggest going for happy hour. Margaritas are very good. Shane is the best waiter ever. Friendly staff. Bathrooms clean."}
{"text":"After a very long night of drinking, me and my friends headed to Steel Cactus for the bloody mary bar and some delicious Mexican breakfast options. Upon sitting down at the rooftop bar, it seemed as though Steel Cactus was a bit hungover, too. Only one other seat in the whole place was filled, and it casted this eerie morning-after vibe across the bar.  We sat down and I ordered my much anticipated bloody mary and headed to the bloody mary bar, which had plenty of options for mixing into your drink. One thing I would have loved to see at the bloody mary bar was a freshly-grated pepper option, but the jar of lemon pepper had to suffice.   As I sipped my spicy bloody mary, I ordered the huevos rancheros which, upon arrival, were underwhelming. I wasn't as impressed with the enchilada sauce and i found the hard corn tortillas difficult to eat. Everything needed a bit more salt and pepper and copious amount of hot sauce. Seeing that I was extremely nauseous from my hangover, I could not finish my bloody mary or breakfast. The bloody mary was quite tasty and I really wish that I had been able to drink it but I was not in the right state to be drinking it.   I must say though, as this experience was rather unexceptional, our waitress was the kindest person and was very personable. Even when I asked for an extra plastic bag in case I puked in the car ride home, she never judged me one second!   Discalimer: Steel Cactus's to-go bags are NOT good for puking in the car. The bloody mary does taste just as good coming up as it does when it's going down (if you know what I mean).  Update: after my hangover subsided and I reheated my huevos rancheros in the microwave, they tasted much better. Perhaps Steel Cactus should nuke their food before serving it as well."}
{"text":"I was really afraid to come here after reading the reviews about the service, but we tried it nonetheless and I was very pleasantly surprised.   The first thing I appreciate about this place is how every design detail has been thought of. As a detail person I can so appreciate that. Lighting fixtures, tables, chairs, the stairs, the wall along the staircase, the open air windows in the warmer weather, the music... This place definitely has an ambience and I dig it.  We got here just before 5 on a Saturday night (tonight, actually), and it wasn't too crowded or too empty. Our waitress, Megan, was absolutely great. Knowledgeable about drinks and food, and on top of everything. We were never waiting around for her to come back which is such an awesome thing. We were still looking over the menu twice when she came back and most waiters get miffed and ignore you for a while when you get to talking with your party instead of reading over the menu (the nerve!), but this girl was back in just the right amount of time. I've never done it, but I'm sure waiting tables is a frustrating azz job, so I can appreciate someone who does it well.  Anywho, on to the food. I ordered the Taco Burrito and I'm not sure I've ever made a better decision. I love tacos. I love burritos. Combine the two and I'm pretty much really excited. The beef was seasoned deliciously, the rice was tasty, there was cheese and beans, sour cream and lettuce and diced tomatoes. I'm the kind of person who just keeps going 'Mmmmm' with delight when something tastes good and YO that was happening with this burrito. It was a little messy to eat since the sour cream, lettuce and tomatoes were on the side, but I'm sure it's so the lettuce doesn't get soggy and the sour cream doesn't melt all over. I'd still devour another one gladly, messy hands and all. The more I think about it the more I decide that I'll be returning for another burrito when the craving strikes. For some reason it's so hard to get a decent ground beef burrito and I'm so glad to have found this one. Am I sounding like a whack job? SHUP it was just a really good burrito, okay? The rest of my par-tay was very pleased with their meals as well (another burrito and tacos were ordered), and they were raving about their margs, which were on special for $5 for cinco de mayo weekend.  My only advice on this place (other than ORDER THE FRIGGIN TACO BURRITO)  is to avoid it at all costs after 8 PM. It seems to get boisterous from what I can tell walking by on an evening stroll. Unless you're looking to get belligerent on Yinzeritas. Then this place will be perfect for you.  Oh oh oh and also, I did want to comment on the staff's garb. I think it's a requirement to wear short shorts for the female waitresses, which I find pretty distasteful but, um, America, eff yeah, or something like that. Just wanted to note that as an interesting observation."}
{"text":"My first time and probably my last. I ordered through a mobile app for delivery. The food arrived at the right temperature so that was no issue. I ordered a quesadilla with beef and queso con chorizo. The quesadilla was alright, the ground beef was seasoned but over cooked. The queso con chorizo did not contain chorizo, it contained beef. I don't know if that's how it's really served or if it was an error when they made the order but either way it was disappointing. The chips paired with the queso dip were very greasy too. I probably should have popped on here first to check reviews, oh well."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere at the rooftop! Efficient And fast service on a Friday night. I recommend it. And the chips and queso were amazing"}
{"text":"Very spicy good chicken nachos. Shane the best waiter. Margaritas are sooo good Suggest going for happy hour, better deals and still a lot of food for the price."}
{"text":"This is a great happy hour spot. Came straight over after work on a Friday. They had half off on appetizers and drinks specials. Took a little long to get served at the bar but once I was greeted the service was good. I spent about  $20 including the tip for 2 appetizers and  strawberry yinzerita."}
{"text":"I think Steel Cactus is a little underrated here on Yelp. No, it's not perfection and it's definitely not real Mexican. To be fair, I only ever come here for lunch or weekday dinner when it's not filled with drunk Shadyside girls and the \"yinzerita\" crowd (ew). I really like their tofu tacos but they definitely need extra hot sauce poured on for flavor. They give you options between REALLY American (\"gringo style\") and Mexican-ish American. They have fantastic drink specials, especially the $2 mimosas on Sunday (however, why on earth does brunch only happen until 1pm?). Prices are lower than Mad Mex and portion sizes are more friendly to non over-eaters.   Space is huge, including a rooftop deck, and I've never had real problems with the service. Ultimately, Steel Cactus is the kind of place with something for almost everyone, and a good place to bring parents."}
{"text":"Steel Cactus is one of those places that I don't frequent often, but as a place for a decent happy hour, I would recommend. I met with a friend on a Friday for drinks and dinner. We were able to sit at the bar despite it being relatively busy and were able to snag two margaritas for $6 a piece. Not a terrible price and they were really delicious! I recommend trying their seasonal blood orange and cranberry ginger margs. Worth it.  Thankfully we were in no rush to eat as it took about an hour of waiting for us to be seated for a meal. They had the upstairs closed (not sure why, possibly because Cinco de Mayo was the next day and they had decor up there?) so it took significantly longer to seat people. What agitated us was that there were several small, 4 person tables COMPLETELY EMPTY that they would not seat anyone at. Just our luck, as soon as we waited a full hour to eat and were seated in the back area, they began to seat people in the front that had been empty for an hour. Go figure.   Our waiter was great, he announced that he was new to serving and that he would do his best to make sure we got everything we needed. He was incredibly friendly and he did an outstanding job at taking care of us. Food in general is pretty standard, nothing terribly unique, but if you are simply looking for general Mexican fare, this is a good option."}
{"text":"Got some steak tacos from Steel Cactus today. I got them through UberEATS and the service was spectacular. In less than a half hour I received my steak tacos with rice and beans guacamole and chips. The guacamole was OK nothing great nothing horrible. The steak tacos were probably some of the worst tacos I've ever had. I have no idea what the meat was but it was definitely no kind of steak. It was very mushy and you could squeeze it flat between your fingers. It literally looked and probably tasted like Alpo. Never again Steel Cactus!"}
{"text":"The worst meal we've had in a long time.  20 minutes to get our drinks after we sat down, another 15 for the chips and salsa, and I wish our main courses never showed up.  We had two waitresses (waitress in training), how hard would it be for one of them to run over with our drinks and chips?  And the place was empty!  Anyway let's just say the service was lousy except for another waitress (extra fit young lady) who was very pleasant and helpful. Now to the food- first we ordered the chips and salsa and of course they charged us $4 each for two salsas without notifying us.  Ok so be it, but the problem was that the salsas were fermenting like they have been in the back of the frig for months!  Anyway, I needed to eat something after 45 minutes so I ate them but everybody else was grossed out. Next, I had the burrito and luckily it was fairly edible but rest of the table ordered salads and they looked horrible.  My wife had the chicken fajita salad but came out was lettuce and uncooked red peppers, that's it!  No chicken , no guacamole, no nothing.  The others were Cobb salads and the chicken looked totally burned like a charcoal brickette.  They didn't want to complain and said it was nonetheless tasty but I'm sure they went home and are probably still talking about it. Finally the place just didn't appear or smell clean.  It had that sticky feel and smell almost like a Sunday morning in the fraternity house. It's a shame because it's an A1 location with a great outside seating area and nice decor inside. Need less to say we will not be back.  Patrons and mad mex are much better options."}
{"text":"Visited here while attending NSEA conference. A fellow conference friend and I were wandering around and decided to try. It took a while to be served but the waitress was warm and friendly. The nachos I had were enormous and so delicious. I also enjoyed the margarita but wish it was presented in a better cup instead of the regular short clear plastic cup. All in all the food was delicious ."}
{"text":"I came here for girls night with some friends a few weeks back. We had just hit the end of happy hour and our waitress was super helpful in telling us to order extra drinks before the deals were done! The tacos are all pretty good and we also had some queso and guacamole! Totally didn't disappoint for some good drinks and snacks to talk about our weeks!   I would totally return!"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch earlier today for a friend's birthday. I was very disappointed in the \"Bloody Mary bar\" I got my glass with ice and vodka and trekked over to the bar. There was tomato juice and  2 3-tiered stands with one bowl of lemons. Bacon strips were placed in cups and 6 or 8 different spices were at the end of the table. That was it. I assumed they were replenishing so I sat back down and waited a few minutes for the servers to bring out all the goodies from the missing spots on the tiers. After no one showed up, I asked the girls by the table if they were filling the empty spots and they said \"no, this is all we have. We ran out yesterday.\"  No olives, celery, hot sauces, Worcestershire sauce, horseradish. No celery?! Nothing fun but the bacon. All they had to offer was the lemons, bacon, and spices. By the way the spices were in jars and they only provided 1 spoon. You had to use that solo spoon for all of the options. I was bummed. 7$ was too much for that sad display. Why even offer a make your own Bloody Mary? I really should have skipped it and got a beer instead.  With that being said - our server was very friendly, we were seated quickly, food was tasty, and everyone else enjoyed their mimosas and beer."}
{"text":"My daughter who is a college student dined at your South Side location yesterday evening. She was there for a formal event for a school fraternity. At exactly 11 they were waiting for their buses to pick them up and were told they had to wait outside. I'm not sure what time you close...but as a restaurant manager myself...I would never make a large group that had just had a large event at my business wait for their ride outside. That is not worst part of it. My daughter was traumatized at what she witnessed next. As they were waiting on the sidewalk outside the restaurant for their buses to arrive...a extremely large bouncer comes out of the building while aggressively shoving one of her classmates. He then proceeds to push him up against a fence with his hands around his throat lifting him off the ground and choking him. He did not stop until he went unconscious. While this was happening my daughter and her friends were all trying to pull him off of him to keep him from hurting him and the other bouncers that followed them out were physically pushing them away instead of jumping in and helping this poor kid. I don't know exactly what went on but there is no excuse for this behavior. He's lucky the kid wasn't killed. I hope the family of this kid is pressing charges against your business!"}
{"text":"I recommend coming here specifically for happy hour. They have decent offerings, half priced apps and drink specials every day of the week. I wouldn't say the food is anything to write home about, but I've not had a bad experience here either. I've only had the apps so will comment on those. The shrimp ceviche isn't the authentic mexican or peruvian quality, but it is passable. Can't go wrong with the guac and chips and would recommend those for sure, the spicier version has jalapenos in it.  Queso dip is pretty standard but satisfies the crave. The rooftop is pleasant when the weather's nice. It's in a great location, so it's convenient for a quick or casual bite, from which you can move onto your next great adventure. It's a great meeting place, accomodates large groups, and I always see the after work crowd there to unwind. Overall, I feel like the food is in the same range as a Chili's or Applebee's, but given the vibe and location of the place, it feels like a step above."}
{"text":"I went here with a large group and the service was terrible. The waitress treated us like we were two small groups with the table that split us in half. My enchiladas were not hot when they came out of the kitchen. If you want to have great Mexican food, go to Emiliano's down the street. Steel Cactus was not what I expected. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Read yelp review before going even with all the negative reviews I thought I'll give it try. Boy I wish I didn't!   Food OK and over priced.  Inexperienced waitress"}
{"text":"Hooooo boy. Let me start with the end: we left without offering to pay a dime. I don't remember the last time I tipped less than 20 percent. I have never, ever been driven to walking out of a place without paying. What a shitty experience. It wasn't even a mess there or particularly busy, or understaffed, which is the most puzzling part of all this. Here is a list of stuff that happened on our visit. Most of them individually are totally forgivable, all of them experienced in one visit is just not great guys. Not great! Sad!  -11:40 we arrived and ordered -drinks take so long we contemplate asking the bar for them. Coworker does not get drink ordered but no fuss is made because she is happy with water. -dips come, wrong queso given to us. It's fine we are happy with the regular queso. Mistakes happen sometimes. -order more drinks. They do not come and after 25 minutes we ask the bar for them. They've apparently been sitting there waiting for the ever-absent waitress to bring them to us. -when seated at the bar, I overhear another patron saying \"I think they forgot my tacos.\" I feel you, my friend. They seem to have forgotten our tacos as well. Coworkers tell me they watched two people waiting to be seated storm off because the hostess is MIA. -table of 5 that arrived 15 minutes later than us have been served their tacos and are given their checks. They leave.  -waitress doesn't check on us until around about 12:50 when she tells us for the very first time that the kitchen is \"backed up\" does not offer any other details to help us understand or sympathize.  -we agree we are going to get the check and leave regardless of what happens by 1 pm. -1pm my coworker stands at the podium waiting for the hostess so he can discuss our situation. We have 1 hour for lunch and have been here going on 1 hour and 20 minutes. She does not acknowledge him and stares at the podium.  -I stand up with my arms crossed and say, \"Ok, that's enough. We are leaving.\" Hostess looks at me clueless and says \"What's wrong?\" Like she hasn't been here the last hour and a half and isn't aware of what is going on in the restaurant she is supposed to be hosting. I pointed out the table of five we watched arrive, get served and leave before we got our food and could barely get served drinks. -we stand and stare at her waiting for some type of reaction, or acknowledgment and get none so we leave.   It's like everyone here was really stumped by how tacos work. Unfortunate for a taco place."}
{"text":"This is the best place for pre Pirates eating and drinking.  The Mexican Cobb Salad is the best thing ever.  And now they have a beer created just for them, called White Cactus, and it is fabulous.  The staff is the greatest you'll ever find.  You will not be disappointed with anything there.  And the prices are great.  I love this place."}
{"text":"i know what you will think - he gives a two star review and eat there again! What's wrong with that guy? - Well I wonder myself. I was very unhappy with my second visit there. They only have terrible beers on tap, and they don't have a list of decent beer bottles. How hard is it to carry some decent brews, fgs. We're not in the 1980s anymore. the food (Tacos) was mediocre too. so, beat me if I go back."}
{"text":"If I could give double the stars, I would. I really think this is an overlooked Saturday brunch spot. I've been here for brunch twice and have been so happy each time.   Brunch has a Bloody Mary bar with so many topping and their Bloody Mary mix is delicious. I love making my own and it's only $7-$10 depending on your vodka choice. I definitely recommend the breakfast nachos, they are what dreams are made of- basically nachos smothered in the perfect amount of queso, jalape√±os, and scramble eggs.   It's a must-go spot!"}
{"text":"Riddle me this - how do you screw up rice? Rice served was hard. Had the shrimp tacos. The server couldn't pronounce the name - she really didn't care. Flavor was there but shrimp were cold. For a very slow night service wasn't all that great. And a 50 cent up charge for sour cream. This place is good for the college crowd but not those who want true Mexican."}
{"text":"Great addition to Walnut Street.  I highly recommend attending for happy hour as I think they have one of the best happy hour deals in Pittsburgh.  From 5-7 it is half off all appetizers which includes guacamole, chips/salsa and quesadillas.  The specialty drinks at $5 and they usually have $2.50 beer specials and $3 wine specials.  This past visit I went with the specialty margarita (also the Yinzerita is only $7 at happy hour) and my date choose the Moscow Mule.  We ordered chips and guacamole (the guacamole is delicious!) and I got a beef taco and he ordered the pork quesadilla. All super delicious and it only came to $21!  On Tuesdays it is Taco Tuesdays so you could order as many $2.50 tacos as you would like and can pick from flour or corn soft shells (they do not have hard shells) and pick your meat as well as the toppings.  Great place in the summer with the rooftop bar! When it is busy sometimes the service is not that great but I can live with that. Also recommend trying a pitcher of margaritas (great deal)."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner with some friends. Service was fast and was on point with drink refills and reorders. Only down side to the meal when my fajita came to me it was sizzling and looked great but I kept smelling something burning that wasn't food. And then I saw it smoke bellowing out of the cloth handle for my fajita plate. IT WAS ON FIRE! I quickly took it off poured my water in it and handed it to them. Not a bad experience just different"}
{"text":"All I have to say is that bartender was super awesome. I think her name was Sara. She took care of us and made us amazing drinks. Def worth checking this place especially if Sara is working!"}
{"text":"The servers are pretty knowledgeable about gluten free options on the menu... and if they are new the kitchen staff is more than happy to help.  I've had the nachos there, which have to be baked and have a differing cheese placed on them ( the cheese is mixed with beer and the friers are not dedicated).  However, they were very nice in accommodating me on these slightly crazy requests in my quest for nachos.  They werent the best or most crispy nachos, but it was nice to have with a great margarita.   Very interesting atmosphere and decorations."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. The food is medium-good, the drinks are moderately priced, and the decor is somewhat interesting. It's a good idea to get out here and TRY a Yinzerita, but expect a heavy sugar headache afterwards. The best part about steel cactus is probably their happy hours on weekdays from 5-7, featuring half-priced appetizers and $5 cocktails. Pro tip: Try their mojito without simple sugars."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and will return! The rooftop patio on this place is amazing! It's cozy and full of life! The drinks and food are great as well. There's a variety of seating available including outdoor and at the bar. This place can get pretty packed on the weekends so plan accordingly. I fully recommend the tacos made your way!"}
{"text":"I'm biased because I am from California (San Jose, CA specifically) where we have sooooo many amazing authentic Mexican (and not only Mexican but Salvadorean, Peruvian, etc.) restaurants around me.. So I understand that I am super lucky and privileged to have quite the selection.   I came here for dinner on a Saturday night - took a cab from Oakland but it's walking distance. We were seated immediately by the host and our server promptly greeted us. She gave us extra time to look through both the drink and food menus then came to take our orders. We ordered:   Drinks (the drinks were my favorite part of this place, sooooo good!) -Cactus Caribbean Hurricane (spiced rum, coconut rum, OJ & pineapple juice) -Steel Cactus Mojito -Patron Select Blood Orange Margarita  Food -Camarones De Chili Lima -Cactus Molcajete Bowl (mix of carne asada, chicken, jalapenos, shrimp served in a HUGE heated bowl along with lots of sides like salsa, black beans, etc.) -Carnitas Enchiladas (DO NOT order these, they were not good at all. Dry and not tasty.)  Anyway, I give the service 5 stars, the food 2 stars and the overall atmosphere/vibe/interior 4 stars. Altogether, 3.6 stars. :)"}
{"text":"In my (probably not so popular or nice) opinion, I think this place is a pox on the spirit of walnut street in shadyside. They paved paradise and put up a parking lot. Long are the days of the couple of relatively quiet dive bars in shadyside and enjoying a nice stroll home at night. This place is like a loud club with a patio: loud music, loud (and drunk) college or post college graduates stuck in their old Greek life days, cigarette butts paved over the sidewalk in front. Further, the food and drinks here aren't event particularly good. I understand that this is some peoples' scene, but it's not really mine."}
{"text":"The service is so bad here. Servers are not attentive. Tables all around us need to be bussed. Food is good when it finally makes it to the table."}
{"text":"my family and i went here for lunch today and we're not too satisfied with our meals. to start we got the Mexican street corn and queso dip. the mexican street corn was on the cob and did not have much flavor. the queso dip was almost completely saturated when it got to us, we could barely dip our chips in without getting a huge clump of solid cheese.   for our meals we got an assortment of tacos which were alright but the common conclusion we came to was that they were all just very very bland and did not have much flavor. the taco I would suggest ordering would be the carnitas and red cabbage slaw (cactus style). other than that the food was filling and the service was amazing and the ambiance and setting was fun, but the food was very bland."}
{"text":"The taquitos were good but the salsa is made fresh and delicious. The staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Not sure if I really feel like reviewing this place based off of the poor service and the cold food that had to be sent back. Our waiter was nice, but he never came to our table, ever. We were without drinks for extended periods of time and waited over 40 minutes for our food. When it finally came out, my tacos were ice cold and my friends nachos were also cold. Who wants to eat cold nachos? We had to send our meals back and they were re-heater obviously not re-made. This would have been fine, had they not burned my hard taco shells. At this point I decided to not even bother saying anything because it just was not worth it. They did deduct a percentage off our bills for the cold food, but The icing on the cake was that all of our bills were incorrect. My bill had my friends beers on it, which was annoying, but I still didn't bother with it because we really wanted to leave. Overall, just come here for margaritas, don't even bother with the food."}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience at Steel Cactus. After waiting for an hour on the Nowait app, and clearly specifying in the notes that we needed high chairs, they sat us at a high top. Then they told us it would be another 20 minutes, and after 20 minutes it was another 20. We left after 1.5 hours not even getting a seat. Hostesses need to learn how to use their own POS system if they allow guests to use Nowait."}
{"text":"After walking around the city, we stopped in here to grab some drinks and a bite to eat. Lucky for us we'd made it just in time for the happy hour. So we sipped on $3 drinks! They weren't super strong but hey for $3 we were happy. Then we decided to order some chicken nachos. They were good, but nothing fancy. I'll have to come back and try something else from the menu and see if they kick it up with the entrees.   But overall, this is definitely a pretty solid place to grab drinks and a bite to eat. And you can't beat the location!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Pittsburgh. I come with my girlfriend regularly and we always get the Dip Trio, consisting of queso, guacamole, and salsa. The dips are always fresh and full of flavor. Chips are also always fresh and never have that stale bite to them. We usually get the 3 tacos, i get mine mexican style, with cilantro and onion while my GF gets hers gringo style, tomato, cheese, and lettuce.   Service is awesome, everyone is friendly and we usually get seated and served rather quickly!   Atmosphere is awesome with 2 levels of seating and when it is warm they open the roof and windows to take in the views of walnut street in shadyside.  A must stop place to eat if you are in the mood for mexican food and a good time!"}
{"text":"I had the fish and tofu tacos for lunch. They use corn tortillas, which I respect. The fish was good and the tofu mixture was interesting, but the tacos were not particularly great.  The location seems good though. The bar has a lot of space around it, and I assume the patio is quite nice."}
{"text":"The only reason I would come back would be to get wasted...maybe then I would enjoy the food. Our salsa tasted watered down and the food overall was very bland. Disappointing lunch."}
{"text":"I've been to other locations before and this one in the North Shore did not change my opinion of the local Steel Cactus chain. Steel Cactus, to me, is just average all around. I came to this location for a work holiday lunch and to my surprise, we were the only ones in the entire restaurant. The dining space was also surprisingly small, which I think other locations might be larger.   Our table ordered a selection of chips and dip and the red salsa was my favorite. I thought the guacamole was bland and the queso was ok, however resembled more of a beer cheese than a queso. I ordered the shrimp tacos and thought they were pretty tasty. The sides, though, were an embarrassment. My sides of rice and beans came in little cups that you typically get condiments in, which might not even be so bad if the platter everything came on weren't so large, highlighting exactly how small everything was. For $13, I expected a bit more.   Steel Cactus is not my first pick if I'm in the mood for Mexican, unfortunately. Will I return? Maybe, but probably not anytime soon."}
{"text":"When it comes to Tue nights and your looking for some cheep eats with a cold beer, Steel Catus is where it's at. You have your choice of multiple meats with fresh mixings. I highly recommend you check it out if you're ever in Shadyside on a Tuesday. Just a reminder the kitchen closes at 10 so don't wait to long or your out of taco luck."}
{"text":"Back again!! Seriously one of my favorite brunch places. I took the husband this time, and he couldn't decide what to get off the menu based on all the yummy sounding dishes. If you're a fan of Southwestern/Mexican style food- this is a total hit! He got the breakfast enchiladas. Definitely a smaller portion than my order: the breakfast nachos. We also got the mimosa pitcher, which held us over nicely. After a relaxing and long breakfast, our bill was a meager $28, minus tip. Always a fan of keeping things economic. Staff were very friendly and attentive as usual. We also loved that they had the windows open, had a very summery feel.Looking forward to going back for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes! Everything you want in brunch!  I went with a medium sized group- it was a great atmosphere in the morning (11am). Food was amazing. I got the breakfast nachos. SO delicious. It's not that often that I go somewhere and start planning the next time I am coming back after just one bite of my dish. The mimosas were great and very cheap. The staff were amazing- very gracious and helpful with our group size and splitting checks. It was a hit!"}
{"text":"Steel Cactus is a beloved go to restaurant for me. One of my most frequented and I'll tell you why: dip trio and yinzeritas. The dip trio includes salsa, guac, and queso and is the perfect thing to share with your friends at happy hour. Yinzeritas are frozen margaritas with a beer upside down in them. Yes, it's as awesome as it sounds. You can't beat the location on walnut street and the rooftop level makes for fun vibes. Everything I've tried on the menu is excellent, I only docked one star because the service is typically very average."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars for happy hour in southside ! So many good deals and the drinks are so great. Love the atmosphere here"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service sucks. Last night it took like 15 minutes to get a waitress and when she finally came she graciously reminded us that the kitchen was closing on 10 minutes. Wouldn't have felt as bad ordering that late if we had gotten a waitress when we came in. She also just acted like she had a stick up her ass which definitely put us off even more. For the most part, the bartenders don't know what they're doing and would rather sit on their phones behind the bar than get anyone a drink. There are some rare gems that have more than two brain cells that work here but definitely rare."}
{"text":"So, Mexican food in Pittsburgh? Hellz yeah! Yinzerita & the 412 Burrito. 412 Burrito? Well yes, a burrito with fries and slaw in the burrito. It's Pittsburgh! We ate upstairs on the patio. Seems a bit out of place for the neighborhood. Shadyshade seems pretty gentrified to me with it's Apple Store and Microsoft Store, but then again, there's nothing fru-fru about a Yinzerita and a 412 Burrito."}
{"text":"I was in town for a week and I was craving Mexican food. The reviews on yelp weren't that great but I decided to go anyways. I ordered the carne asada, medium rare. What I got was well done steak with uncooked rice and bland beans.  The food was terrible and I wished I hadn't come here. The first sign should have been the empty tables.  This place is a must skip. Their website was good to get you in but don't let that fool you. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Stood in front for 5 min nobody greeted me another 10-15 min sitting down nobody acknowledged my presence. I saw another table being waited on. Then my wife had to ask the bartender who was too busy flirting with other customers for a waitress.  Ooh and they don't serve after 10 pm which is displayed nowhere on the website. Worst service ever. I understand if the kitchen is closed but taking 20+minutes and no waitress visits my table is utterly ridiculous."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, good food, & reasonable prices. Always have some kind of drink special going on. \"Yinzeritas\" are . Sometimes they get pretty busy but they manage it well. We shared a Molcajete bowl, which was plenty of food for two. The carne asada and pollo was fantastic. The shrimp had amazing flavor but was a bit overcooked. The sauce it came with was sizzling hot and had excellent flavor as well. I've had better Mexican food, but it's a solid place. Great for groups and great for drinks. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Let me start this off with I have been to the Steel Cactus in Shadyside multiple times. I have never had a complaint. This is my first time at the airport location. It was just okay. Maybe it was what I ordered???  I did a build your own salad with tofu. Im a lover of tofu and this was blah. I couldn't finish it. Not sure what spices they tried to put on it but it didn't work.  It was clean and orderly through the line and the staff were very friendly. I will not be ordering tofu from here again."}
{"text":"We were seated by 1215, waitress took our drink order and returned quickly with drinks.  She didn't check on us again until 1250.  Told us 'food will be out in a minute'.  We could see the food sitting at the pickup area ready for her to pick them up.   She walked by several times and didn't get them.  We walked out at 1257.  She never came to refill our drinks Despite walking past our table a dozen times. Go somewhere else for tacos or to Slice on Broadway for quick easy service."}
{"text":"The food is consistent in that it's okay, at best, the service is lackluster, and they are able to get by being mediocre because of the constant flow of college kids on weekends.   Avoid."}
{"text":"I guess I can't really be surprised that a restaurant like this butchered Mexican food.  After all, it is more Americanized Mexican food than anything.  If you like Qdoba or Chipotle, then you'll be fine here.  Otherwise, you'll be pretty disappointed.  I ordered the Carne Asada Burrito.  It had obvious fillers like black beans and rice but I wanted to give it a shot.  The meat tasted pretty good.  But it was overpowered by black beans and rice.  We also ordered a Chicken Quesadilla.  It didn't differ from my burrito all too much because all I tasted was black beans.  Worst part about this place are the tables.  The tables have holes all over them to mimic holes in wood.  Looks great except we find bits of old and new food in all the holes.  How disgusting is that?  My friends said the drinks were good but how bad can any place mess that up?  Overall, it's an ok spot to hang out and talk.  The hostess was nice and the waitress was good.  I had no problems with service.  If you like the Qdoba and Chipotle type Mexican food then you're fine here.  I don't really feel compelled to come back or give it another try."}
{"text":"Stopped in to meet with friends. We got the 3 dips and an app of pulled chicken taquitos as well as drinks. I will say I enjoyed my tropical hurricane and frozen margarita a lot. Both strong and the margarita was so thick I had to give up on the straw. The queso was the best out of the dips and the taquitos were also very good. Everyone else seemed to enjoy the burritos and salsas. Our sever was good. Stopping by to check on up as well take take our staggered orders. Now I can't comment much on other foods but If I get back for dinner I will update my review."}
{"text":"I visited Steel Cactus for the first time last week, but my first visit was enough for me. I arrived around 6:00 to meet with a group for happy hour, the plan being to talk over cocktails and nibble on food. Should have made for an enjoyable time overall.  We placed our food order not long after most of us arrived, only to sit with our cocktails for about an hour waiting for the food to get to our tables. By the time things were coming out of the kitchen to us, one of our party members had to get a box and take her freshly delivered food home. I myself asked for a check the moment the food arrived so that I wouldn't be held up too much longer.  As for the food itself, I will grant that I thought it was tasty - I was pretty delighted to sink my teeth into something after the long wait. I had ordered two tacos as part of Taco Tuesday: $2.50 per taco, not a bad deal. I more or less got to order them my way, too, as you can pick the type of shell, meat, vegetables, and sauce/salsa on your order. However, if we had been here any other day I may have been disappointed - a regular order of 3 tacos is at least $10, a bit much given the size of them. Admittedly, the normal order comes with beans and rice, so - you do get more than the tacos. If the tacos were a bit bigger, I think I'd be less hesitant to give a normal order my blessing. Compared to some of the tacos I've eaten elsewhere, the ones I got were snack sized.  Ultimately, while I didn't order a full meal, my food and cocktail were very good - and reasonably priced during a Tuesday happy hour, yay! And across the board, people thought their orders tasted as good mine. But the experience as a whole did not leave me begging for more. I plan on frequenting other watering hole and taco joints in the 'Burgh, at least for a while."}
{"text":"I love their apps!!!! Happy hour is a STEAL because you get half off drinks AND half off apps. I got the street corn and my friends got the queso and quesadilla. We all loved our dishes. The service was not very punctual but still very friendly. The environment is a nice place to hang out with friends at the end of a long day. Especially when its warm outside they have open air seating!"}
{"text":"Because of some bad reviews, we almost didn't stop here, but, I thought that because it's in my community, and had a good happy hour deal that maybe I should make my own decision. The food and drinks were really good. Our server Jane, was super cool and very nice. Good times. I had the grilled mahi tacos, my friend had the pick 3 tacos ( she had chicken and steak) she said they were both very good. The atmosphere is great. We were outside on the upstairs deck, very nice."}
{"text":"This was honestly the worse tacos I've ever had! Not good at all...the beans that came with my tacos were so bland and disgusting. The Mexican street corn was OK nothing out of this world. I've definitely had better corn in other places. Don't waste your time coming here if you want good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Awful place.  Bouncer used aggressive force on our friend this evening.  What happened to asking questions first before using Force?  They knew we were leaving establishment and our friend was thrown out of restaurant by bouncer.  No questions just removed...thrown into heating lamps and broke his glasses.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"This was a cool bar to grab a great margarita-esque drink and other similar cocktails on a night out. Bartenders were nice and I liked the vibe, lighting, and decor of the restaurant. They have some different margarita flavors and an interesting assortment of fruit flavored mixed drinks. I came here mostly to grab a drink while doing a mini bar crawl on Pittsburgh's East Carson Street. One complaint I have is that I really wish they offered chips and salsa or guacamole even after their kitchen closes so you can munch on something while drinking. I'm surprised this place has as many negative reviews as it does because drinks were great (I got some kind of electric blue cocktail) and the pictures of the food look really appetizing. I would definitely come back here to try out more options on their drink menu and sample the food despite the plethora of negative reviews this place has accrued. My advice: give this place a try and form your own opinion."}
{"text":"I'll keep this one brief:  I love the food here, particularly the carne asada (in any form).  They also have good daily drink specials.  Love the upstairs balcony and  deck- rain, shine, snow, it's open (and covered/heated/etc. when it needs to be).  I think I'm a little old to hang out here on Friday and Saturday nights.  The crowd seems to be grad students and young professionals- like well under 30.  I like to be able to sit- instead of stand around at a bar.  Anywho, try it out and judge for yourself."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I'm a huge fan of authentic Mexican cuisine. El toro loco and Emeliano's are my go to in the Southside. Me and my buddy went for happy hour where they have some decent drink specials and solid food specials. We both ordered the three amigos chips/ salsa and queso. The three amigos is 3 tacos 3 different kinds of meat, your choice of corn of flour tort and two kinds of toppings. Wow, they were phenomenal. Our bills came to $6.02 after splitting the bill. I would of gave 5 starts but they charge for chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I visited Steel Cactus for brunch after church. I had steak and eggs that came with potatoes. My steak was cooked well but just tasted ok and eggs were blah. The potatoes that came with it were a nice flavorful addition. A mimosa came with brunch and it was delish, perfect levels of sweet and citrus.  The restaurant is fairly dark where the tables are. Even in broad daylight...just an fyi. I've been here one other time and sat on the bar side. It's a fun place to visit on a Saturday night and the folks working here are very friendly.   While it's a cool spot with ok food, I'm not sure if their worthy of more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"I went to Steel Cactus with a large group for happy hour drinks and dinner.  Decent, not great beer selection.  Service was very good and we had no problem splitting checks in a large group.  I love the space Steel Cactus has, the rooftop seating area is roomy and heated when needed.    I ordered the Camarones Tacos (grilled shrimp, sweet chili sauce).  The tacos were very yummy, but I am admittedly a sucker for faux mexican.  If you like Mad Mex, which this place will inevitably get compared to, you should be able to find something you like at Steel Cactus.  I wasn't too excited about the rice and bean sides, but I ate them all, so that says something (I can eat an unlimited amount of any quality of rice, though, to be honest).  During my happy hour I did hear people's disappointment with the Yinzerita, as others have reviewed here.  My advice:  avoid it, go for happy hour, enjoy a Dogfish Head or two (or more), and don't expect to be transported to Mexico CIty.  It is what it is, folks."}
{"text":"Jeff was awesome! After coming home from a long trip we decided to grab nachos at the airport before heading home. We asked 3 different restaurants and just heard no. Jeff went above and beyond saying even though it wasn't listed on the menu he would make it. Great food, great service."}
{"text":"They have fresh foods, and everything can be basically create your own. Nachos aren't on the menu, but are available with lots of toppings.  They have tofu for the vegetarians out there.  Fast and friendly service. Normal human being sized fountain drinks, and reasonable airport food prices. I do wish they had red onions instead of white..."}
{"text":"First time here with a few friends. We were looking to have a few drinks and a light snack before heading over to the festival. We headed over to the bar while we waited for our table to be ready. I tried the spicy margarita, wasn't my favorite - it was a bit too bubbly for me for a margarita, but every place has their own recipes.  Once our table was ready, we sat down and looked for what we wanted. Again, we wanted something small, so we were going to split a chips and queso. We are told that they are completely out of chips. As a restaurant serving Mexican food, that was a huge letdown. So back to the drawing board.   We order another round of drinks while we're deciding what to order. The drink I asked for had a floater in it. Usually, those drinks come with the shot floating on top. The waitress told me to let her know if it was in the drink. I've never been there before, and as a first timer getting that drink, how am I supposed to know? So she did bring it back to the bar, and they poured a shot in there, so not sure if I was drinking double what was supposed to be in there.  After we placed our order (an order of taquitos and the boys split the 3 taco order) - we see tables around us receiving baskets of chips. This was disappointing - the waitress told us they were out. If they were just making more, we would have waited. Disappointing to see around us.  I do give the place 2 stars, because their food was good, and drinks weren't bad. They just seem all over the place - places have off days, but was just really disappointed with everything as a business."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes and not one person approached to even say hello. We were seated by a host. Yes it's a baseball night, no it's not busy as we sat down at 4pm. Obviously the service sucks, so not sure about the food. A bunch of other places in immediate area to choose from."}
{"text":"Like the salad there. They have a tortilla bowl and avocado is always great in salad'"}
{"text":"I love Steel Cactus!!!!! The queso with chorizo is out of this world and their margs are so refreshing. Regina was the nicest server and she was so on top of everything! Muy buno!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely beautiful. They did an amazing job remodeling the old Villa. The atmosphere is incredible and on a warm, sunny day it is so much fun to sit by the big windows or out on the rooftop patio and drink margaritas.  The food is okay, nothing spectacular... But the fun drinks and atmosphere make up for that. Happy hour prices are great, too!  Super excited that this place is finally open!!"}
{"text":"I went here during Cinco De Mayo with two of my friends. I read a review on CBS Pittsburgh saying it was one of the best places to go for the holiday. Their website and even when you walked into the door said that they had specials. We get seated and the waitress tells us that they don't have any normal specials because it's Cinco De Mayo... WHAT? It was posted on a stand downstairs as soon as I walked in. Her response \"oh. We meant to take that down.\" It was still there as we walked out... Overpriced tacos. Seriously. Three tacos for $12 that aren't anything special? Ridiculous. And we got margaritas and they weren't even frozen. I'm never going here again and I'm highly disappointed."}
{"text":"We just can't understand it- every time we come here, no matter where we sit, service is awful...!    The last time we were here we sat at the bar when there was only a couple other people there and it took 10 minutes for the bartender to come over.  Then when we ordered the drinks that were the happy hour special- she charged us full price.  We sat down at 5:15, 10 minutes to order, HH started at 5, we get the tab and see we were charged full price.  When we asked about it- she said that her register 'never flipped over to HH'.  Seriously?  Do u think we're that stupid...?    This time we sat at a table and ordered drinks... Coors Light 'drinks' in CANS...  And it took the over 10 minutes to bring us 2 cans of beer...  WTF...?  Why...?  Maybe it's a server issue, and I don't like to call out servers but ours today was Jenna...    Don't come here thirsty..."}
{"text":"I would have given it 5 stars but it was quite loud and warm inside when I was there so that took away from some of the goodness of this place. The Queso dip with Chorizo was fantastic and so was my dinner, I would certainly go here again."}
{"text":"You can always find great deals at their happy hour. My favorite is Wednesdays in which you can get a PITCHER of margarita for $10!   On top of that, all their apps are 1/2 off. I usually get the \"Three Amigos\" which consists of 3 tacos, discounted for $4. It usually fills me up pretty well, and with the pitcher shared with a friend, the cheque comes out to ~$10!   Not the most amazing food, but I'm a huge fan of their prices!!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet.    The food is standard PennaMex.  Think Mad Mex, but not as good.  The chips have been stale two out of three times.  The chicken tacos were bland--cumin, cayenne, black pepper, cilantro...any or all would have been welcome.  The guac just made me sad--and tears of guac depression could have only improved things.  The draft beers are small and the \"yinzerita\" makes me want to punch someone.  The regular marg is all shades of awful--the mix is just bad and there's either too much or not enough salt.  The music selection can be fun.  The bros are always in high numbers here if you're looking for chest bumps and high fives.  Why did I give it three stars?  It's totally fine on a summer night with a few friends on the top floor either before 11pm or not on a weekend.  Or it's okay for sitting at the bar on the second floor and enjoying a whiskey--the top shelf liquor selection there is decent .  I've only had terrible and very slow service at top bar and at the tables on all floors, but I've found the security staff and second floor bartenders to be super nice.  It's a bro bar on the new Walnut Street, so take it as what it is."}
{"text":"Multiple take out orders, never right. Last time (6 weeks ago) I picked up on my way to work around 9p and it wasn't even close to right but I was already gone by the time I looked in the bag. Called back and they told me I had \"a week\" to go back to claim a new meal. Not likely to happen, sorry; especially only within A WEEK!!! I also recently went for drinks on the top deck and waited well over 20 mins despite there being only maybe 20-30 people up there and 3 people behind the bar, 2 of whom were just washing glasses. They really, really need a manager. As someone who has worked in the restaurant industry before, there just is no supervision and it seems this is another top-down disaster in Shadyside. Great concept, poor execution"}
{"text":"Worst new years experience I've had. Super basic open bar, no coat rack, a tray of cold ground beef as an \"appetizer\" and trying to make a taco while standing is almost impossible. There was no description anywhere about what drinks were included or not. The bar closed at 1 when the ticket said it would be open until 2. The bathrooms were not ready for 400 people and every worker we interacted with was extreamly rude. Thanks for ruining our friends first visit to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, once for dinner and once just for drinks. The first visit started out with a botched reservation; I had called to reserve a table a few days earlier and they had no record of it. We got seated relatively easily for a weekend, however, so it wasn't a huge deal.   I am a big margarita fan, so I started off with a frozen mango. It was one of the only, if not THE only time in my life I have hated a margarita. It was sickly sweet and extremely artificial tasting. I ordered the chipotle beef tacos with pomegranate seeds for dinner, which were good, but unable to be enjoyed through the margartia-induced nausea.  I tried out Steel Cactus again last night hoping for redemption. I ordered a regular marg on the rocks and ended up giving away 2/3 of it. The bartender made it with orange juice (?!) and some other juice out of a bottle and it tasted nothing like any margarita I've ever tasted. Sickly sweet and frothy on top, just like the last one. Bleh. I'm usually very amenable to this kind of food and I adore tequila based drinks, but I'm going to stick to beer here,"}
{"text":"I came here on Monday for my birthday and sat at the bar with my friend. I noticed that the happy hour drink menu had changed and they raised the prices. The bartender made us a pitcher of margaritas (you only get two small drinks out of it). The margarita was SO tart I could not finish it. I also noticed that even when you ask for water they give you plastic cups. I guess they don't use real glassware anymore. The bartender hid in the corner and was not very friendly. We left fairly quickly and went to find a more enjoyable bar."}
{"text":"Steel cactus is great! My friends and I stayed for trivia and had a blast!  Cassie is even better!!!"}
{"text":"This place, which caught my eye en route to the Shadyside Mad Mex, is entertaining solely for its brazen ineptitude and fair to average food.  The friendly, but totally dizzy and distracted and ditzy,  servers are amusing to watch as they wander around in a stupor...basically kids new to the summer job, but they need some guidance and instruction. I ordered a frozen Margarita.....I was told it would take a half hour to make!!!   Talk about being wasted away again in NON-Margaritaville!!!!  The tacos were of the Taco Belle school......just okay.  Their home made chips are good, though.  Maybe they need that guy on TV that whips whacky restaurants into shape.....although this place seems pretty successful. Folks were flocking in like sheep to the trough.  I will try it again....they gotta improve at some point."}
{"text":"Went here Friday night around 11PM.  The decor alone makes me want to go back! The lights are so pretty, the wood bar is cool. The bartenders were working hard, and were able to keep me and mine satisfied with drinks. Upstairs were two bars, one with an open top. Very cool! The dance floor was poppin' and everyone was enjoying the DJ's throwback rap and mixed songs.  Recommend, and will be back!"}
{"text":"Poor excuse for tacos and not cheap. Bad views for TVs and limited beers on tap with no draft list available. Bartender was nice and helpful. Also, flies everywhere."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food is not good. Salsa tasted like a metal can. Taco meat was awful. Guac was just ok, queso was ok but a little lumpy..this was my second visit and will be my last and it is a shame because I love sitting up on the roof:( they need an overhaul on their recipes.. Worst Mexican food I have ever had and Mexican is my favorite"}
{"text":"Wouldn't serve chips and salsa after midnight on a Friday.... I'm hungry! Other than that it was a great place to hang out on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"We sat upstairs and our waiter informed us that we could not get a yinzarita bc the machine upstairs was broken. I am confused why we couldn't get a yinzarita bc the food is made downstairs so why can't you walk a drink upstairs. Waiter was not attentive but the food was good"}
{"text":"I've been to the south side location multiple times and received better service. We chose to sit outside and we waited 15 mins at least to get a glass of water and meet our waitress. Very disappointed in the service at the north shore location.  Also they do not offer happy hour specials during game days. All around a bad experience"}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour with half price appetizers and fun vibrant atmosphere.  Food is average, but I think the other positives make up for that."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough awesome things about the Steel Cactus staff and leadership team at the South Side location on East Carson. My fiance Tyler and I held our wedding shower upstairs, and not only was it a beautiful day on the patio with the nice weather, but EVERY guest was so happy and pleased with the service that was provided to us. The food was great, the bartender Kevin was PHENOMENAL (and makes the BEST white sangria, even gave us his recipe!) and we truly had the most wonderful time. Sarah Masterson of AMPD Group, the managing company for Steel Cactus, was incredibly accommodating and simply the best party planner you'll ever meet -- I highly recommend that you hold your next event here. The flexibility we had in decorating the place, and customizing the space to fit our needs, is simply unmatched in the city of Pittsburgh. Whether you're looking to hold an event or simply finding a good spot for eating out with friends and family, you can't pass up Steel Cactus!"}
{"text":"Guacamole was very hard. Steak meat was dry. Probably one of the worst Mexican food I have ever had in my life. I would recommend this place for drinks only."}
{"text":"I love coming here when the weather is nice to sit up in the rooftop lounge area and enjoy the pretty view of Walnut Street.  The margs are pretty decent, although I vow to never try the yinzeritas... There's just something about beer and maragaritas that doesn't mix for me.  The quesadillas are great here, always crispy. The salsa options are delicious as well. I had a mango salsa in the summertime, and it was delicious.   The service here can be a bit spotty, so I usually don't come here during the cold months when I can't sit in the rooftop bar area. But if you're looking for a good view in a good location, this is definitely a fun spot to try in the warmer months."}
{"text":"Fun place to hang out and have a few drinks. Especially in the summer as there is an outdoor area and the walls open up.  My yinzerita was only about 2/3 of the way filled up last time I visited,  which was pretty disappointing. The food is not anything special."}
{"text":"I like to come for Taco Tuesdays for the $2.75 Dos Equis, $5 margaritas, and $2.50 tacos. Overall the food isn't that great, but not bad if you're only paying two bucks for a taco. I like to get the tofu because it's fried and has a nice crispy outside, and I love the avocado creme sauce. The guacamole is way better at mad mex however, and the chicken and tortilla soup was really sour."}
{"text":"First off the serve brunch until two that's made to order came in 20 min before 2 and they would not honor my brunch request... Don't put it on the menu put 1:45 if u don't want to cook u til 2 lazy cooks. I should have gotten the manager and made the cooks make my order but once I get poor service I'm out went down the street and had wonderful breakfast at Pamela's I'll never go back for there mediocre mimosas and Americanized Mexican food"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the worst dining experiences I've EVER had!  Disgusting is the word that comes to mind.  Being seated at an uncleaned table and given a menu covered with food from previous diners was the first clue.    There was also a bird flying around in the restaurant, which the server told us had taken up home there for some time and they could not get it to leave.    We ordered mimosas with warm orange juice and almost no champaign.  We had to request that the table be cleaned.  We had to ask for plates, flatware and serving spoons.    That was still not the worst of it.  I ordered a vegan burrito....first bite...INEDIBLE!!!  I had to send it back...it was filled with the same tasteless rice which was piled high as a side dish...I did not order a substitute.    My 3 friends ate their salads to their detriment.  All 3 were unwell as the afternoon progressed ultimately resulting in explosive digestive responses at the end of holiday day.  DO NOT EAT OR DRINK IN THIS DISGUSTING PLACE.....EVER!  Sad state of affairs to have a restaurant this bad in Shadyside."}
{"text":"I love coming for Taco Tuesday just because they're $2 tacos. Keep in mind that they're not the greatest tacos in the world, but they are $2. There are also Dos Equis specials on Tuesdays. Overall, if you're craving a Tex Mex chain restaurant, Mad Mex has better food and margaritas, but if all you need is a cheap taco and a beer, this place will work."}
{"text":"Came in after a Steelers game.  Lots of tables open, 4:30pm.  The host promptly informed us he was \"overwhelmed\" and gave the 3 of us 2 menus.   Twenty (20) minutes later, we hadn't seen a waitress/waiter, so we left.  On the menu, it let us know that there were no substitutions on game days.  So I assume they are somewhat aware of when games are?  And maybe people are coming to eat?    We moved on."}
{"text":"First time in Pittsburgh from Arizona. Here to watch our Diamondbacks play the Pirates. Stop by to have a drink. Service  was great and my margarita was very good. Here for  the weekend and will be back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a Mexican place open up in the heart of Shadyside, but wow was I let down.  First and foremost, the location/environment/ambience/decor of this place is fantastic.  The split level structure, open to the outside as well as the roof top deck are all amazing.    Now for the negatives...The bar service though was somewhat mediocre.  Yes, it was kind of busy, but it seemed like they were staffed with plenty of employees and should have been able to do a more efficient job of handling the flow of patrons.  The food was somewhat bland.  No complementary chips were provided.  Not a huge fan of their traditional guac as it really lacked the taste of true avocados, and could probably benefit from more garlic and salt.  The veggie burrito was quite bland and lacking enough beans and veggies.  It really tasted like fast food.  I suppose the food was reasonably priced, but I've had better for the amount I paid.  Unless you're in the area and are dying for a margarita or something, I would just come here for drinks and just skip the meal.  There is better Mexican food to be had in this town."}
{"text":"On a nice day Steel Cactus is pretty legit, not gonna lie.  Hanging out on Walnut Street in Shadyside requires a certain fortitude and Steel Cactus delivers it!!   I came in and posted up with a few friends at a table right by the bar and closest to the open windows allowing one to see Walnut street. On my particular visit, the iPhone 5 was being released, so it was fun looking at all the Apple peeps waiting in line to get their hands on the newest parcel of apple products.   I went with the Yinzer Margarita that comes with an upside down bottle of Corona in a giant margarita glass. It was mois bien.   For the fare, I went with the Mahi Tacos, or some kind of fish tacos, and they were spot on. Just as good if not better than Mad-Mex that's for certain.  I'll be back Steel Cactus. You can count on that..."}
{"text":"A go to place for my friends and me. Their happy hours deals are hard to beat, and who can resist a yinzerita?"}
{"text":"5:50 on a Tuesday:  Sat down at the bar.  It wasn't full, maybe 10 or so people.  i was on the phone finalizing plans with the person I was meeting.  Yes, it was rude of me, but then the bartender asked me if I needed anything, blatantly on the phone.  I say one second please. And he walked away.  6:04 Bartender returns to ask me if I need anything.  No menus, no napkin, no nothing.  I ask for menus and order a margarita from the happy hour menu.  (Couple next to me asked for many things such as check and it did not show up in a timely manner)  6:10 The other bartender comes over and asked if I have been helped.  I was not sure if I had so I just said, \"I am not sure\" and then asked for my margarita again.  6:14 Margarita shows up with no salt although i was asked if i wanted salt and lime.  We ordered then as we were hitting the Yelp party upstairs. When my food showed up (i was never given silverware or napkins) , I immediately asked for my check and did receive it in a timely manner.  Overall, the food was average at best, seemed haphazardly made and not hot, but I really enjoyed our snacks at the Yelp party.    Service needs some improvement for me to up my stars, but I am not sure that I will try it out again on the rare occasion that I am in the South Side."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this restaurant. I think this is the only Mexican restaurant that I had to pay for chips and salsa. The margaritas were weak, and there was hair in my food."}
{"text":"We only came here because La Palapa was full with a 45 minute wait, we were starving, this was across the street, and they could seat us immediately. Sad disappointment. Next time I'll get takeout from La Palapa, or make a reservation there.   To be fair, the chipotle salsa was okay, but the chips were extra tough, and the pile was about four times too large for the amount of salsa.  We tried the beet tacos (interesting, but not amazing), and the fish tacos (downright bad). The rice and beans included as side dishes weren't great either. I think this place mainly caters to the college drinking crowd, but I wouldn't go here for the food. The bathroom was also completely out of soap which is a little gross."}
{"text":"The place is a decent spot for a quick drink in the neighborhood mainly especially during the summer time.  The rooftop patio is very nice and makes a nice little bar.  Bar-tending service could be better though.  Food wise is nothing extraordinary.  It is a decent place to eat; nothing authentic of course - more like Mad Mex type of food.  I would not recommend it for taking there someone to impress but it is definitely a nice hang-out place."}
{"text":"The rooftop deck is a nice touch in the friendlier seasons, but the food could be better. They have a decent happy hour with cheap mixed drinks, house wines, etc.. The chipotle salsa we ordered was good and definitely repeatable. The chips were thick and strong--perfect for dipping into guacamole, which was unfortunately subpar. The avocados must not have been ripe enough and were stringy.  My fish tacos came on double corn tortillas which I approve of, with a side of rice and beans. The tacos themselves were only \"meh\" however, same for the rice. The beans were pretty good.  Overall, my feelings are mixed about Steel Cactus. It has potential, but currently is just a good place to get a drink, salsa, and enjoy the nice weather. The food quality could use improvement."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Menu is selective, not to mention the bad service I had received. The waitress forgot multiple times to give us silverware after our food had come out (which took almost an hour), and the bartender had to find us silverware. Asked for boxes and it took another 20 minutes. Waitress didn't even bring water over after we had asked several times. Not to mention I got food poisoning and was ill for the next few days. Don't recommend it and I will NOT be returning ever again."}
{"text":"We came for lunch on Memorial Day and had an excellent lunch outside.  It wasn't busy but wasn't dead by any means which I'm sure changes on game days.  We shared chips and guac, I had their pinot grigio and Bobby had a Dos XX.  Chips were fresh and guac was super flavorful.    I ordered their Mexican cobb salad with the chipotle ranch and Bobby had the chicken burrito.  Honestly our food was really good and it was shocking because we have been to the Shadyside location twice and both times, the food was absolutely awful.  We will only eat at this location from now on.  Service was great and we had no complaints.  I assume the lack of consistent service mentioned in other reviews is because they are still new and establishing a routine in such a busy area.  Hopefully they get it together, however we had no issues."}
{"text":"Gave it a second try after Michele w/Steel Cactus's management group invited us back to actually try the food. Thank you, Michele! This time service was extremely attentive and orders were filled accurately. Guac was very tasty! Veg entrees are a little limited and not creative, but the food seemed fresh."}
{"text":"We went here this morning for brunch and the food was fantastic.  Great nachos and breakfast burritos.    The biggest disappointment was the service that we received while we were there. We were one of the only parties at the steel cactus and couldn't find the waiter for 10-15 minutes at a time.    At one point I was so frustrated that I just went to the bar for a beer and began ordering drinks for our group (9 of us!).  I guess I really shouldn't have expected much from a server that told us he was \"chillin\" when we asked him how he was doing ."}
{"text":"I was really impressed by both the food and the drinks.  They serve the best margarita in Pittsburgh.  They food was deliciously prepared  and rather authentic.  The staff was attentive and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Great service!   Went before a Pirates game!  Fun atmosphere and the food was great!  Very authentic fresh Mexican food!  Carnitas were great and the habanero salsa was spicy but so delicious!  Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The interior and roof Deck at steel cactus are great- there is tons of room to sit and the outdoor heaters really make a big difference on chilly nights. The service was friendly and prompt, but I did think that the drinks were really underwhelming. I would just have expected a better Margherita from a place like this. I actually switched to mixed drinks."}
{"text":"I knew I'd be back to visit Steel Cactus, I just didn't realize how quickly! After having lunch there this past Saturday (see my original review), I ended up there later that evening to meet some friends for drinks.  They did have a few interesting pumpkin beers that I haven't tried yet, so that was a plus. We were seated upstairs and given menus, as the other two people in my party wanted to have a late dinner.  The waiter came to take our order and my friend was a little too drunk and not paying attention, so I told the waiter her order: a chicken quesadilla.  As soon as she (my friend) heard this, she said \"no no no, it's fine, I don't want food after all.\" So I asked the waiter to cancel that.  Our other party member proceeded to order his food (the 412 Burrito) and then tell the waiter to go ahead with the chicken quesadilla anyway.  I'm not sure what happened, but we ended up with TWO chicken quesadillas and the 412 Burrito.  I wasn't very hungry but figured if they made it, we might as well eat it.  I had one piece of the quesadilla and wasn't terribly impressed. Again, with the black beans, except this time they were inside the quesadilla.  Every time i picked up a piece to eat, the beans came plopping out and onto my plate, the table and the floor.  Also, the cheese was minimal, if not nonexistent... and I don't know about you, but about 75% of the reason I order a quesadilla is for that ooey gooey cheese!"}
{"text":"I've been weeknight drinking here before and was pleased with the draft selection, but recently I went for food and wished I hadn't.  The chips were stale and chewy, but at least the salsa was okay. Most places don't know how to prepare fresh and flavorful vegetarian food, so I wasn't completely surprised when I got the tofu tacos and couldn't taste anything but the salted \"sweet\" corn. The tofu was cold, the lettuce was warm, and the avocado \"sauce\" didn't taste like anything at all.   This is not the way anyone should spend National Taco Day. I'm going to need a do-over for sure."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant because it has a cool name and is in a nice area with plenty of upscale shopping. However, the service was very slow. I ordered the chicken fajitas. They were okay. The chicken was good but the grilled veggies were not the best. No rice or beans came with the fajitas, which was odd. Also, the guacamole that came with it was basically a giant chunk of avocado in a cup. I was not wowed by this restaurant and have definitely had much better Mexican food. The atmosphere was fun, though, and the waiter was pretty nice."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped here for Saturday brunch.  I ordered the shrimp and grits.  It was not cheap.  I didn¬¥t expect what arrived at the table.  A soup bowl of lumped-together dry white grits.  I don¬¥t believe they were seasoned at all, but looked like they had been cooked into a solid mass, then broken up into lumps with a fork.  On top were perched five or six quarter-sized shrimp that had some dry Southwestern-looking seasoning sprinkled on them.  They had that rubbery, ¬®We¬¥ve been cooked for a long time.¬®  quality. There wasn¬¥t a drop of anything moist or tasty in the whole dish.  I have to wonder what restaurant owners or managers are thinking when they put food like that in front of customers.  Horrible."}
{"text":"Last week we went for a quick lunch. Fish Tacos and Mahi Mahi entrees were fantastic. Even better, our server/bartender, Amber was a joy. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This time it was MUCH better.  First scene, the hostess was no where to be found so we were almost sat by the bouncer (bouncer on a Thursday night?). Our server was Joey (I think everyone there kept calling him Jo-Jo). Very sweet guy. We all shared a queso dip. My boyfriend and I had the molcajete bowl, which, let's be real, is the only thing you should ever get at Steel Cactus, and my friend had the chicken fajitas. We came in for Wine night on Thursday, which they were out of the Bluefeld riesling, but Joey came by and showed us 2 other options that were just as reasonable (Estancia Chardonnay & Naked). Unfortunately for Joey, the hostess had seated us without silverware, so he had to run and grab some, and the wine glasses could have used a wipe down or a wash prior to being given to us (my friend's had red wine and lipstick on it still). The bread pudding dessert of the week was fantastic, so good that my boyfriend ended up stealing most of it from me.  All in all, the food and the server were the best part of the restaurant. This visit was infinitely better than my last visit, but could still use some improvement."}
{"text":"Pretty good mexican food. My wife had the fish tacos which she liked and I liked the chorizo tacos. Nothing special, but a good dinner. My 4-year old also liked her cheese quesadilla (she's not ready to write her first yelp review yet).    Would definitely come back for the drinks / bar - my wife really liked her peach margarita. The outdoor seating on the 3rd floor was also a plus (especially where it's hard to come by in Shadyside)."}
{"text":"Steel Cactus, yet another property from the ampd group, the company that's synonymous with plagiarizing other already established restaurant ideas and menus, has now copied The Gobblerito from Mad Mex. I'm waiting for the day when they announce $.99 Chalupas \"inspired\" from Taco Bell .  The actual burrito isn't bad. It's basically a thanksgiving dinner rolled up into a wrap, and I think the gravy is a cheesy turkey gravy that's smothered on top. Still, overall a better option than the mediocre menu options they try to pass along to us on a daily basis.  Still, all things aside this company has never done anything that's impressed me or anything that's original, for that matter."}
{"text":"I stopped by here earlier tonight for dinner by myself.  Steel Cactus is the newest addition to the center core at PIT and is located where curritos used to be.  As a matter of a fact the setup is exactly the same as well right down to the presses at the end of the line.  This specific Steel Cactus is in the fast casual vein and feels like a Chipotle.  You walk up to the counter, order your food and then walk down the counter with a worker telling them what you would like.  On this day I decided to go with a naked burrito bowl with cilantro lime rice (there was no brown rice option), black beans, chicken, romaine lettuce, cheese and hot sauce.  All of this only cost a little north of $8 although it looks like they charge you extra if you get more than one sauce.  Still for an airport, that's pretty cheap.  The bowl that it comes in looks big but ends up being shallower than you would think.  As for the taste, it was decent but didn't stand apart from any other Mexican fast casual restaurant.  I couldn't taste the cilantro or lime on the rice but it was cooked nicely and the chicken was moist and juicy.  While I enjoyed the hot sauce, I wish I could have added another one in the mix to give the meal a little more flavor and moisture.  The bottom line for me is that I will stop by here again in the future.  While it didn't fill my up as much as most fast casual Mexican restaurants do, the price is right, it tasted decent and probably most importantly it nicely fills the void for Mexican food at the airport."}
{"text":"Starting out we had relatives over and they wanted to visit a place to eat that was a bit close to a certain landmark so we went here. After a late lunch at 3 pm we wanted something simple so Steel Cactus it is a place I am aware of from living in Pittsburgh but never visited. Let me make it known I could tell this was not some super authentic Mexican restaurant so I didn't review it on that level which I'l leave the private owner that spends 24/7 in his kitchen doing the best he can to make the best in town Mexican dishes. So rating scale let's do Tex-Mex vs the Competition !   Starting out we got some chips and salsa which if I recall mild and hot but the hot didn't seem really hot but it's just chip's and salsa were not going to make that much of an impact here but note it anyway. A margarita my gf got which was tasty and a cheap Miller Light on top for myself.    Main meals I got a 3 of the special tacos. I can't actually recall the name of the taco as it is not updated online on there main menu at either locations. Bistec (steak) taco with corn salsa, queso fresco and pickled onions.. Really tasty and hit the spot.  All around the place is neat, the service was good and the prices are decent. I will return to try some specials and tacos. 3 stars on the rating scale here but in reality let's do 3.5!"}
{"text":"We had the lousiest night at the Steel Cactus in Shadyside recently.  We were at the restaurant with out-of-town guests who we brought to because we heard it was a great place for Mexican.  We had reservations for six at 7:30 on Sat. Aug. 20.  While we had heard it was Jam on Walnut night, nothing prepared us for the horrendous evening at the restaurant.  The staff allowed the bar crowd to take over the place, especially the top floor where we were seated.  Despite being seated in the back corner of the dining room, we had bar patrons leaning up against our chairs.  The noise level was atrocious!    But even more upsetting was the service.  Our drinks - now remind you we were dinner customers, not merely bar flies - were served in small plastic cups for the same price as the glasses to which we are accustomed.  Margaritas were not even rimmed in salt.    Appetizers: Our trio of sauces with tortilla chips was an embarrassment for the Steel Cactus.  Each ramekin was less than half filled.  We ordered Mexican street corn which while it appeared to have something on it, was incredibly tasteless.  And the cost for one ear of corn split into three....!!!  Ridiculous.  Our main dishes were just OK.  Perhaps because we were having a lousy time - not being able to hear, being jostled by bar customers infiltrating the dining area, and a totally inattentive waitress who took 20 minutes to bring us appetizer plates, forks, etc. - we could not really enjoy our food.  We couldn't wait to get out of there!  While I understand there was a big event in Shadyside, the Steel Cactus should have been prepared for it.  It's not the first time for a Shadyside event.  Perhaps because of this, everything was super subpar!  We attended Little Italy in Bloomfield the night before.  The establishments went over and above to put on a great night for their patrons."}
{"text":"This is a really nice bar and restaurant with multiple levels and an outside rooftop patio....  The is a cool place but the food is mediocre...  I tried their fall burrito called \"The Bird\" which is a thanksgiving dinner in a burrito with turkey, potatoes, corn, gravy, etc., etc., etc.... it was mediocre and disappointing... it also came with guac that had cranberries in it.  I guess if you want to hang here it's cool."}
{"text":"I'm not one to write a scathing review but this place was just dreadful. Granted, the interior is clean and quite nicely done but don't let that fool you. The service here is downright HORRIBLE. Sat at the bar for over 10 minutes while watching lazy entitled waitresses babble incessantly to each other totally ignoring the presence of customers. As we were getting up to leave (which we just should have) the manager came rushing over to take our drink orders and then turned us over to an unpleasant bartender who seemed put upon to wait on us. The drinks themselves were also bad. My girlfriend ordered a whiskey sours which was nothing more than some rot gut whiskey mixed with a neon yellow, straight from the bottle sours mix. Not even topped with a cherry. Truly pathetic. I ordered a draft beer and it was about as bad as a draft can be. There was no head whatsoever and it was about 50 degrees. It was served in a nondescript pint glass with visible water spots. Yum.  The food itself is also absolutely atrocious. Ordered a chicken nacho appetizer and the chips were stale as if they had been fried days prior and the chicken was bland and laden with gristle. My girlfriend ordered the chicken avocado salad which was a poorly assembled disaster of unmanageable chunks of iceberg lettuce, browning avocados and over cooked, dry chicken with poor excuse for an adobo seasoning on it. I had the carnitas tacos and they were equally terrible. The \"carnitas\" were nothing more than a cheap pulled pork with a sickeningly sweet barbecue sauce on it covered with a cheap yellow white blended cheese. The corn tortillas were also of terrible quality. The rice was not homemade and the beans tasted old and of course straight out of the can.   Overall this place is pretty bad. If you like to eat in a place that looks cool and that's all you're worries about, give this place a try. If you care about good service, authenticity, quality or even general taste of the food steer clear of this cesspool. I know I will."}
{"text":"I had a steak and cheese quesadilla with pinto beans added. The steak was super tender!"}
{"text":"Cheap beer in plastic cups and the tables are sticky. There are plenty of other places to choose around this area."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Steel Cactus yesterday for lunch.  The space is really cool, and the menu is very promising, but the execution just doesn't quite work out and we ended up disappointed.  We ordered: --chips and gringo salsa:  shouldn't chips and salsa be free?  That gripe aside, these were quite good.  The salsa had a nice favor and good kick from the jalape√±os, and the chips tasted fresh. --fish tacos:  \"Grilled Mahi, red onion confit, pineapple, avocado, cilantro, & cayenne lime crem√®\" sounds amazing, and it almost was, except they burnt the fish.  I'll give them points for the idea, but it didn't quite work out. --chipotle brisket tacos:  another dish that sounded fantastic but then just wasn't.  I tried a bite of my husband's lunch-- the barbecue sauce was fantastic and the pomegranate seeds were a nice touch, but the meat itself tasted oddly like bacon and not at all like slow-cooked brisket. --rice and beans: came with both tacos.  Nothing extraordinary, but no complaints. --Pacifico: I'll give props to anywhere that carries my favorite Mexican beer, but lime and a glass would've been nice.  Also-- do they have breakfast, or brunch on Saturdays?  There was a bloody mary bar, but we didn't get a brunch menu.  Then I heard someone at the table next to us ordering a breakfast burrito, and was kind of disappointed because that probably would have been my order.  On the bright side, the prices are reasonable, the service is good and I'm a fan of the neighborhood.  I haven't been thrilled with Pennsylvania Mexican food yet, and unfortunately Steel Cactus was not the exception.  I'll have to keep looking."}
{"text":"Steel Cactus is fun. It's a fun restaurant / bar.  I enjoy myself here, but it isn't a place to eat or drink.  The crowd is great. The bar staff is great. The basic drinks are well made.  The food is alright. It is definitely better than suburb Mexican, but I'd prefer Round Corner when it comes to food.  The cocktails are boring. Mad Mex does a better basic volume margarita. Round Corner has a better margarita selection.  Steel Cactus doesn't have any Mezcal.  Overall, Steel Cactus is fun. That is why I go."}
{"text":"Having an early morning flight meant one thing to me: I got to enjoy breakfast.  I am not a breakfast person at all, I'm usually still asleep well into the early afternoon due to my work schedule.  But having to be at the airport in those god awful hours I figured I might as well seek out this food that people eat for breakfast.  Seeing that Steel Cactus was now located in the airport I thought why not give it a shot.  I like Steel Cactus when I get a chance to eat at one of their spots in the city.  But as Jason F. had stated in his review, they went the way of fast casual in here and it's kind of missing the flare I was expecting.    I decided to get the Breakfast Burrito Bowl.  I went with chorizo for the meat to give it a bit more of a Mexican kick.  This is your basic burrito bowl, but with breakfast in mind.  So think more egg than rice.  The bowl consisted of scrambled eggs, chorizo, black beans, breakfast potatoes (the same generic ones you will find at other fast food places), cheese, pico de gallo, and probably the best part the avocado creme sauce (which is a smart alternative if you don't want to pay extra for guacamole).  The mixture was good, but to me, this didn't scream breakfast.  I don't know why, but it wasn't filling at all either.    It's a good option to have in a pinch, but I wouldn't come here for breakfast, come here for a burrito.  Not a breakfast one, but a true burrito.  Also, make sure it's not a long flight you will be on either."}
{"text":"I love me some good Mexican food.  And this place didn't disappoint.  We must have been here on an off night.  Place wasn't too crowded so that meant we got stellar service from the moment we walked in the door until we left for the night.  For not being here before, the staff were patient enough to take time and point out a few suggestions on the menu before I opted for the Pollo Queso Burrito.  The poblano/chocolate salsa that came with it, amazing.  As we waited for our food to arrive, I browsed over their drink menu and decided to go with their take on a classic, a margarita.  Typical margarita with the top shelf stuff, the first sip made me feel all warm and fuzzy, so I knew that meant the rest of the drink would do me good.    The wait staff were totally on point.  Never faulting when it came to our order, even when I requested no salt on my glass rim for the Margarita, she took it back and got me another.  She even had some time to chat with us as we waited for our food.  Even when we were done with our food and requested to leave it there as we stepped outside, she was fine with that and ensured that it would remain there until we got back.    There was just one downside.  The table.  I mean I liked the way they looked, rustic and unique.  But cleaning them has to be a difficult task.  I only say that because when I put my hand down on the table I somehow got a piece of glass stuck in one of my fingers.  But our server came to the rescue almost immediately with a band-aid in hand.  All in all, it was a great experience and I'm sure to return again."}
{"text":"Fair at best. Frozen margaritas were good. Staff was friendly enough. Guacamole wasn't good. Salsa wasn't good. Chips were okay. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Lunch in Shadyside.  Had a beef burrito with green chili salsa.  Food was tasty but would prefer a choice of shredded beef rather than ground.  Green chili sauce was Ok but I haven't found anything in Pittsburgh that compares with New Mexico.  Portion was large,  Spanish rice blah and no guocomole or sour cream."}
{"text":"I was here last night for a friends birthday dinner. The manager Kira helped prior to make sure it was special for a birthday and not just an average dinner. Ellie was our server for a group of 11 and did a great job. Margs and food were perfect for a 30th birthday celebration!"}
{"text":"I went here for a work event that the restaurant agreed to hold. While the drink I had was tasty, I was only able to have the one due to the poor service. I was about to order a second, when my friend advised me otherwise, as he had been waiting half an hour for his. So I asked for my check instead. And waited. And waited. I asked the waitress a second time for my check. She said as soon as she gets a minute she'd bring it. (It had been about 20 Minutes.) 10 minutes later she came back and asked about what appetizers should be put on which bill. #1- these are questions that should have been asked half an hour ago. 2-At least one of those items should have been comped considering the wait time, and their errors in our service. The wrong food was brought out, the wrong drinks were made. All of which we accepted with an understanding smile. But that question put us all over the edge of patience. We all had to put more time on our meters...simply because we were waiting for our check.   The food was adequate, but nothing Mad Mex hasn't done better for years. The service was exceptionally awful. Don't be a bar in Shadyside on a Friday night if you cannot handle a Friday night crowd in Shadyside. I understand being understaffed, but this was beyond inexcusable. We all felt completely ignored and disrespected. Won't be going back, and neither will any of the 7 people I was with. But given the way we were treated, Steel Cactus won't be missing us, either."}
{"text":"Service was ok and the food was also just ok. I've been here multiple times for different things and this time was the worst. Our server blamed the kitchen that the food was wrong and then said she take off the price of the chips and queso. The queso tasted burnt. My friend was gluten free and the server acted like it was an inconvenience to tell her what she could eat with out getting sick. She suggested a few things and kept saying oh wait no you can't eat that. Go to the one in the south side they have better service."}
{"text":"Ordered three steak tacos and they were dry, so dry a bite got stuck in my throat.  Horrible"}
{"text":"We ended up here on a whim because The Pub Chip Shop across the street was full and I wish we had just waited.   Our meal started with our waitress telling me not to order the tortilla soup I wanted to order because \"it's really bad everyone hates it.\"  Then, we waited 20 (literally) for a beer and a margarita. Only 3 people were sitting at the bar.   My margarita was so watered down I only drank half because... well, I had a plastic solo cup of water already. No seriously, they serve their drinks in plastic cups.   Then, my waitress brought me silverware in a plastic bag. I don't even know what to make of this.  The waitress sat at the bar on her phone the entire time we were there except to clear our plates and take our orders.   Then our meals came. My tacos were so dry I could only eat one. It was like the chicken sat in a pan getting dryer and dryer until they were inedible.   The bathroom was disgusting- there was no toilet paper in any of the stalls, one toilet was clogged and the women's sanitary box was so overflowing it couldn't shut and stuff was falling out.   This was literally one of the worst experiences I've ever had. I cannot believe I paid $45 for a meal here."}
{"text":"The 2 stars are for the decor and that's about it. The service was non existent as the staff was too busy talking with each other vs. their customers. Margarita was ok but I'd suggest 'no rocks' because it was mostly ice like a fast food place. Enchiladas were cold, fajitas were ok. Had to actually ask for silverware...ridiculous. They charge for chips & salsa so I expected a better product, I think it was from a jar. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Nice decor. The service was wonderful.  The food is not the total authenic Southern California mexican but the food was awesome. The guac was in the top 10 I have had.  Great place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Living in Shadyside I thought I would give this place a try. I am not huge lover of Mexican food, but I am trying to broaden my food choices. I do hate giving negative reviews. I know how hard servers, cooks and managers work in this industry, being a prior owner myself.  I was not impressed with the mediocre food or the lousy service. This place could be half empty and service will still be slow. The wait time between being seated and service is horrible.   The food is bland and tasteless and lacking in any kind of flavor.   Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. I Don't recommend this place to anyone. Management really needs to read the negative comments if they wish to improve. There are so many other good Mexican restaurants in the area, this one isn't one of them."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The crowd and ambiance are very cool and the food decent but the service and cleanliness were severely lacking.            We went as a group of 10 celebrating a special occasion on a Friday night. Our waitress was SO RUDE. She rolled her eyes every time we made a request which was mostly because she messed up our order and we waited over 15 minutes for bottled beers to be delivered to the table. When one of us walked up to the hostess stand to ask for a toothpick, she said that she didn't know if they had any and instead of asking someone or going to check, she went back to chatting with a guy hanging out near by.         There was no soap in the men's bathroom from the time that we got there until the time that we left. OVER 2 HOURS! Which means any of the employees using the bathroom were unable to wash their hands. We even witnessed one employee leaving a bathroom stall and bypassing the sink entirely. DISGUSTING!     When we asked to speak to a manager, we waited over 20 minutes before finally just leaving. Clearly the management is as sub-par as the service and employee standards.        We will definitely NOT be back!!"}
{"text":"We're here for the #yelpPIT event. The taco was our favorite! The chef was friendly and appreciated us trying them. The chicken was flavorful and fresh. The chips weren't soggy and extra crispy. Will try other items in the future"}
{"text":"For lunch, dinner, or brunch, you really can't beat the Steel Cactus.  My favorite lunch/dinner item are the tofu tacos.  For brunch, definitely a couple $2 mimosas and either the chorizo burrito or a standard scrambled eggs and bacon.  The breakfast nachos are special, I wish I could eat those everyday.  Also worth mentioning is the decor, it's very interesting and fun to look at.  The rooftop bar looks nice, although I've never sat out there.  You must give the Steel Cactus a try!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here Sat night with husband. Atmosphere is cool and rooftop is nice. Food is mediocre at best. We both had the same type of burrito, but they were very different. One had a lot of sauce inside and no pico, the other barely any sauce and lots of pico. Chips and salsa were good. Service was horrible. The two hostesses are more interested in talking with each other than seating guests. They kept looking at us, but kept talking. We finally asked to seat ourselves, then they seated us. Our waiter was HORRIBLE! He was rude. He kept asking us if we wanted seperate a checks. We were seated at a four top, but sat beside each other. We were both wearing our wedding rings and my 5carat diamond...we are obviously married. My husband said no, but the waiter wouldn't let it go. He kept it up. Then before we left he snidely said \"sorry to make this uncomfortable\". Save yourself the trouble...drive another mile and go to Mad Mex...always great food!"}
{"text":"Fun looking place but horrible chips   , tasteless salsa, nasty food and artificial sours unused in the margarita. Even the soup sucked.   Eat a stouffers mexi meal and be happier"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. There was no wait to get in but my party waited 20 minutes for a server before we asked the host, who said someone would be coming shortly. 15 minutes later the server wandered over without an explanation for the delay. Placed orders for food, apps and drink all at once and waited another 20 just for drinks. The drinks were terrible - took one sip and walked out. Food may have been good, but we wont go back to find out. Only redeeming quality was the music."}
{"text":"Poor service and the food was disappointing.  We didn't finish anything and was never asked if we wanted take out boxes. I ordered the 3 pepper burrito with extra black beans in it. It was mostly rice with a few green peppers and little to none black beans. We will never return."}
{"text":"Yesterday we had a group of almost 20 people at the upstairs bar. I have never been treated so rude. The female bartender was so miserable and did not want to do her job. I asked for a Yuengling draft...she said they were out and walked away. Then I had to get her attention again and ordered a Blue Moon draft and she said we don't have it in draft, its not even up there (pointing to the drafts). It was clearly labeled with the other draft beers. Again she walked away. My friend then ordered a Margarita and she glanced down and said they don't have any glasses for it AND WALKED AWAY AGAIN without asking what else she could get us. When I asked her if she was making the drink she practically yelled saying \"I TOLD YOU WE HAD NO GLASSES\". Another bartender came over to us and I ordered a Blue Moon draft and he got it for me with no problem while I watched other people drinking Margaritas. I was so disappointed in the service and disrespect we received. I liked the bar but will never recommend it because of that one bartender"}
{"text":"MUCH BETTER!  After yelping about a few awful experiences I'd had at Steel Cactus my friend and I were invited to come back and try the food again after they'd had some time to work out the kinks in the kitchen.    It was GORGEOUS outside (last Tuesday, pre hurricane) and we were seated under the new roof.  The atmosphere was very cool and there's a pretty rad fan they have going over the bar that kind of gives the deck a cozy industrial vibe.  Is that possible?  It might not be, all I know is it looked cool and I liked it.  When we were seated the table next to us was RAVING about their food, so much so I thought someone must have been rude to the waitress and was trying to make up for it or something, but then the I overheard the one girl say the fajitas changed her life, so at that point I was pretty much set on fajitas.  Our server, Alex, was really nice.  We started out with the chipotle salsa and chips.  I've NEVER had a salsa that tasted like that, and it was AWESOME.  It almost tasted like it was made from green tomatos or tomatillos.  It was somehow sour, and sweet at the same time w a kick from the chipotle.  I am pretty much obsessed with it.  Its so good I'm convinced it could cure cancer, and I swear after eating it my skin was clearer, my hair looked inexplicably awesome, and my dining companion was 50% more handsome.  This may also have been because I'd had a yinzerita.  Those things are fantastic, but one will get you wasted so be careful, it is a sipping tea!    The fajitas were excellent, the girl sitting to my left didn't lie!  The best part about the fajitas were the roasted red peppers that came with it.  My friend had the chicken enchiladas and he thought they were excellent.  They were pretty good.  The only thing about Steel Cactus is all the food is pretty salty, so you may want to go easy on the hot sauces so as not to overwhelm the food completely.  Otherwise, it was great.  The manager came out and told us about some of the changes the kitchen has made and they really have come a long way since opening weekend.  I look forward to going back.  Try the chipotle salsa!"}
{"text":"Good service. Good drinks. Good food. Great location. Right next to the stadium. No complaints."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here before a Pirates game.  At first we were happy because they had great happy hour specials but then we found out they weren't active during baseball games (which is understandable).  My sister and I ordered the guacamole and then we wanted to split the beef tacos.  We asked the waitress to please bring out the guacamole first as an appetizer.  She did, but then the tacos came out about 1 minute later, so they got cold while we ate the guac and chips.  The guacamole tasted like they used avocados that were not at all ripe.  The tacos were okay.  My sister said that she was pretty sure her mojito had hardly any alcohol in it but I just got beer."}
{"text":"No complains here.  Have been few times here for happy hour but didn't quite feel the need to review the place solely on drinking at the bar until today.   Went here yesterday with few friends for a graduation happy hour. Since we were a group of around 14 - we had to divide  in 2's to be seated in the booth which I wasn't a big fan of. As for the roof top, it was all reserved - so, unlike us make sure to make a reservation for a larger group.   The food was okay. Everyone seemed to enjoy their Chorizo Tacos and the salsa with chips. I especially like the Chipotle salsa. The prices were reasonable. The service.. well, it normally depends on the server no matter where you go.  And yes, don't forget to \"try\" the Yinzerita."}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant, there is a noticeable vomit smell that is overwhelming. After seeing the prices and tasting the food, there is no wonder why it smells like vomit.   While their chips and various salsas taste good, it is a Mexican restaurant so that should be standard. What wasn't impressive was the fajita burrito. It had no real taste and the chicken was dry. It also was expensive and not worth it. Their drink prices are also outrageous and while it may be the most popular bar in Shadyside, they are extremely slow at getting drinks and taking orders."}
{"text":"Decent place. The chicken quesadillas are really good. The chicken and steak fajitas were good as well. Ian was our server, he was really nice. I didn't like the strong chipotle flavor of the Mexican corn.   My problem was the guacamole. WORSE guacamole I've ever had. It was bland and flavorless. I literally had to ask for extra limes to add and season it with salt and pepper... How do you F up guacamole at a Mexican restaurant? Smh if I wasn't really craving guac I would have sent it back"}
{"text":"Terribly slow service.  Bad servers.  The queso tasted like beer.  Overpriced.  Was not happy and will not return.  Took over 20 minutes to bring us our salsa."}
{"text":"I came to Steel Cactus a few weeks ago on a Sunday night.  It was a little too chilly for the outdoor seating, but I think that the selling point is their outdoor seating.  The atmosphere indoors is loud and bar like.  My major complaint is that Steel Cactus is overpriced for serving the same quality of food as Chipotle, but the prices are double.  I wouldn't chose to come back here on my own, but I guess I would think about returning.  At $12 for 3 regular sized tacos and $11 for a burrito, I would say it's just ok but nothing special."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday. It's roomy enough. There was a good amount of space and I didn't feel cramped at all. The first problem I ran into was their beer selection. Barely anything but American beers (i.e., Coors, Bud). I ended up with a Dos Equis Amber Lager--not a bad beer, but it looked like they didn't have the Special Lager. Their mixed drinks weren't bad. I had a mojito. I'd give it 3/5 stars. But again, the selection wasn't that great.   I ordered their fish tacos, and I thought they were pretty good. It came with black beans and cheese, but I was still hungry after eating my dish. For $12-14, I'd like my stomach to be filled. My advice, order the burritos or enchiladas. They looked to be a lot bigger.   My other complaint was that--and this seems to be a trend with restaurants--the appetizers cost almost as much as a meal. My friend ordered taco chips and a soup/salsa appetizer. Around $8. For chips. And salsa. Come on, mate. You're not running a Michelin 3-star joint."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday with a group of 10 people.  Got a table right away, as it was not particularly crowded.  The service was TERRIBLE.  We ordered a round of drinks and it took forever to get them.  I dont think it was the server, but the bar was not working very quickly.  The restaurant was not very crowded either.  We made the mistake of ordering a second round and shots.....forget it.  We had to wait 20 plus minutes for them to get to the table.  Too bad, because the margaritas were pretty good.  But, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Yikes, this place should have a sign that says '30somethings stay out.'   If I go to a place that calls itself a 'Mexican cantina,' I expect to not get a blank stare from waitstaff when I ask to see a tequila list. (To be fair, once they located said list, I was pleased to see that there were a couple of decent tequilas on the list. They were mostly spelled wrong, but they were on there!)  I guess I just can't understand the circumstances in which you would say, 'Hey! Let's go to Steel Cactus!' after the first time you accidentally show up there. It was crowded and hot and disorganized. We'd hoped to order food, but couldn't find a server anywhere in sight. Most people were drinking what appeared to be a huge frozen margarita with a beer bottle in it. If that's your thing, go on with it, but it kiiiiiind of grosses me out.  If I want a huge margarita, I'll go to Mad Mex. If I want authentic Mexican food, I'll go to Cuzamil. If I want good tequila, I'll go to Verde. If I want to feel old, have to pass by half a dozen bouncers to get anywhere, and watch millennials try to pick each other up, I'll go back to Steel Cactus."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had in any establishment. DO NOT COME HERE!!!!!!  My colleagues and I went to this place around 11pm yesterday (28th). We were allowed through the bottom door after showing our ID's. Then we get up to the upper portion of the bar where we were harassed by a bouncer for our ID's again. Granted we thought this was a little outrageous but we complied again. The bouncer refused to believe we were 21 even though we are all 22 and 23. He asked to see our facebook (of all things) to match with our ID. Then he asked to see our credit cards. I have never had that happen before in any place. Three forms for people who are 22 and 23. We were getting a little agitated as you might imagine. Especially since we were cold sober at this point, which makes it even worse. The bouncer who obviously had an agenda decided to kick us out anyway. He physically assaulted two of us.   Unfortunately for steel cactus this happened to me, and probably fortunate for all the other people this might have happened to. I work for the Pennsylvania AG's office, and you better believe there will be an investigation into this, and whether this is a pattern. Due to the sensitive nature of those investigations, I won't specify the exact reason I filed the report. Two of us have also filed police reports against the bouncer as well for harassment and assault.  All the owner has to do is look at the camera's and he/she we will see his/her worker was in the wrong. I hope they take this seriously as you better believe I am.  If anything like this has happened to you at Steel Cactus, please contact me: marksmith191576@gmail.com  Please explain describe what happened, and when it happened. I will gladly add you to the report already filed."}
{"text":"Beware! They might serve you soap in a cup!  My friend ordered a yinzerita that had SOAP in it! That's right SOAP! They clean their frozen margarita machine with soap and sometimes they forget to cycle out the soap before they start serving margaritas in it. My friend asked for a new yinzerita when she thought it tasted funny but the waitress insisted that there was nothing wrong with the yinzerita. Evenutally, the waitress realized there was soap in the yinzerita and gave her a new one with no apology or a refund.   This is a serious health hazard! Seriously now, soap in cup?   I've gone here several times for their happy hour and late night bar experience. For happy hour they have a ton of appetizers for half off and drinks including the mojito and yinzerita. The appetizers and drinks are just ok.  The ambiance is pretty nice during bar hours. If you don't like having smokers in your bar you could try steel cactus as no one is allowed to smoke on the main 2nd floor.  Sometimes they get your drink order wrong when it's busy so watch out for that.   Overall they have bad service, ok food, oh and they sometimes serve you soap."}
{"text":"I initially went to Steel Cactus when it first opened, and I have to say I wasn't initially a fan.  However, things have certainly changed in a short period of time.  The food is spicier, the cocktail list is lengthier, and the roof top...well, the roof top has always been amazing (and definitely the key component that added the 4th star for this review :)  The roof has been constructed to allow it to be opened during warm summer nights, but water proof during the fall and winter.  Heat lamps adorn the majority of the space, so every spot is cozy!  The charred tomato and sweet corn salsa ias amazing, as is the freshly prepared guacamole and chipotle salsas- I couldn't get enough!  The pollo tacos and carnitas tacos were both well spiced and flavorful.  A new item on their menu is the crispy tofu taco- a must try for non-meat lovers!!   For cocktails, we tried the skinny-rita (didn't taste skinny at all!) and the premium margarita (delish).  Will definitely be coming back to sample more of the cuisine...and, of course, to enjoy the roof."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere of this place are both great.  The summer time is the best time to go so you can take advantage of the open windows and outside roof area upstairs.  I have never had anything I didn't like.  The queso is one of the best ive had.  The Buffalo chicken chicken tacos are my usual go to and taste great.  I have had the regular tacos and burritos before also and always been happy with them."}
{"text":"Happy. Burrito excellent--like the ability to design it your way. Quesadillas from appetizer big enough for meal. Ambience nice. Came early on a rainy Saturday evening and no problem getting table. Scherzer's no hit night"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I admit to being somewhat of a Mexican food snob, especially after living in Los Angeles for 26 years. While my server was very friendly (the only reason this place even received one star) the food was probably the worse Mexican food I've ever eaten. I ordered a margarita and we shared carnitas tacos and nachos. The food tasted like food made at a gas station in the morning and not bought until late that night after sitting under heat lamps all day. The avocado sauce for the taco looked like it was squeezed out of a tube, I wish I could say the l margarita was good, but then I'd be lying. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"nope. the restaurant looked nice, but felt dirty.  we watched the hostess pick few pieces of food off of the table with her fingers (gross), but never wiped it off. the food was not so great. the guac was clearly not fresh...it was bland and tasted like pre-packaged goo. the margarita was ok, but relatively flavorless for 9$. salsa was definitely not housemade. you get the idea. cool atmosphere, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch the Sunday after St. Patty's Day. The food is delicious. For $8 get the [SPICY BREAKFAST SANDWICH: Chorizo sausage topped with melted cheddar jack cheese, fresh jalape√±os, Pico de Gallo, and picante guacamole. Served on toasted croissant bun with a side of potatoes]. Would've given 5 stars because we come here all the time for drinks and usually have good service, but it took 15 minutes for a waitress to come to our table. I awkwardly had to ask the hostess if she knew where our waitress was, and when we finally got our food the waitress gave my friend the wrong order and had to go back and give her the right one. Other than that, the staff is super friendly and the food is great"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Food sucks and well drinks are watered down. Waiters are slow, bouncers have something up their butts...you're not a real cop so relax! And the prejudice vibe, ugh people c'mon get over yourselves already."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good Mexican food for a restaurant that appears to be staffed by no Mexicans. They've made a lot of improvements since they first opened and the guacamole has gone from flat-tasting to really good. The portions are generous, the staff is friendly, and the Mojitos are excellent. The one downside is that it doesn't take much for the place to become crowded and very, very noisy."}
{"text":"I'm an LA native, so I am admittedly a little snobby about Mexican food. I feel like Steel cactus breaks two cardinal rules of Mexican restaurants:  1. Chips and salsa should be free 2. Vegetarian options should NOT include tofu  There are many ways to do vegetarian Mexican dishes that don't involve meat substitutes. And if you want to do meat substitutes, seitan and tempeh are way better in the context of a taco or burrito.  If you are absolutely set on doing tofu, crumble it (a la Chipotle). Cubes of tofu do not have the right texture at all for a Mexican dining experience.  Given my background, I order instead the 3 peppers burrito, which is always solid. The service is good, as is the drink selection. I also think the prices are fair. Therefore, Steel Cactus gets a solid 3."}
{"text":"Their \"grilled steak\" was such garbage - tasted like pre-packaged steak strips. My steak salad came with literally four small strips of this - for which they charge an extra $4.5 - and fajita veggies which were actually just unseasoned steamed peppers. So disappointing and not worth the money."}

{"text":"I found Steel Cactus on Southside to be average. I've never been to the one in Shadyside although I've always wanted to while waltzing down Walnut Street whenever i used to live in N. Oakland.  The good.. my Yinzerita honestly tasted fabulous! I'm not sure how much alcohol was in the original margarita because I wasn't really buzzed for having a beer mixed in a margarita but on a positive note, it tasted great. The rooftop bar is also really cool so check it out before the snow comes!! The service was also good. Bobby accidentally spilled my cup of water which went all over the table and floor. Our server as well as one of the food runners rushed over to help us.. well basically they cleaned and mopped all up while we sat there embarrassed.  The average... the food! I'm not saying the food is terrible by any means. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and Bob ordered the steak- I know, you're not supposed to order the same thing while going out but it stuck out to both of us. You get 3 (small) enchiladas as well as rice and black beans. My chicken enchiladas were average but Bobby's steak ones were really tasty. The thing is.. they servings just arent big. While heading home, we chatted that while it tasted ok, it felt as if it was an appetizer. Most places you are so full that you take some home but this isn't the case. We were finished and barely full... Idk I guess you have to go and see for yourself. Next time, we will order an appetizer before our meals.   Since we live so close, we will most likely try it again and i'll update."}
{"text":"Both the bartender and server were attentive, with thoughtful touches like bringing extra napkins without having to ask and making great drink suggestions.  Love the Yinzerita - the drink has that cool factor (we liked the Peach margarita).  The white queso and the mahi fish tacos were very good.  The southwest decor with the star lights and cactus is funky and has an inviting warmth and fun vibe."}
{"text":"I usually have the best time here. However, I went a couple days ago and was extremely disappointed. It took over 10 minutes to be seated, it was not busy. My entree arrived before my appetizers, again the restaurant was not busy and I ordered salsa and queso. Then when my food did come it was cold. By this time, I'm hungry, but the server didn't even stop back to see how the food was. Not the best experience I had here."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since I love Mexican food. Pretty disappointing. We had the chips with pineapple salsa and the pineapples in the salsa tasted rancid. I had the huevos rancheros, the taste was okay but nothing major. Could have had more eggs. The corn tortillas were burnt as well. Service was below average.   I'd possibly try the place again for lunch or dinner instead of the brunch. We'll see."}
{"text":"I liked the food, but the service is kind of confusingly bad. We showed up just before the dinner rush and were told there would be a 15-minute wait for a table for two. When I looked around in confusion at the 4-5 empty tables I could see, the host told me they were all reserved. However, we only had to wait for about 5 minutes before they discovered that there was, in fact, a table available.  Anyway, after we got seated everything was much better. My sizzling fajitas were served on a very hot cast iron skillet, as they should be, and they were very tasty. The small tacos were also good. I didn't like the specialty cocktails much, though--the mango one tasted kind of like soap.  Assuming the seating service was a fluke, I'd say 4 stars."}
{"text":"The rooftop makes this place worth going to, otherwise the smell, the food, and the drinks are not worth it. I don't know how you can serve bad salSa and bad guacamole but Steel Cactus manages to. It honestly would taste better if the went across the street to rite aid and bought a jar, its gross. Their margaritas are unbelievably sugary and have almost no alcohol in them. The interior has a musty smell that is really makes me lose my appetite every time I walk in. I really don't get this place, a little seasoning on the tacos, and a new salsa and guac recipe could go a long way"}
{"text":"I had the worst time here Cinco De Mayo. It was short lived because my friend and I were sitting at the bar upstairs and all your servers/bartenders acted like we weren't there. We were seated and it wasn't that busy. None of the bartenders would make eye contact with us and when one of them was filling up a drink in front of us we asked if she could help us and she said \"no I can't.\" Very unattractive bartenders with trashy looking cut off shorts on with personalities to match. I guess this place hires anyone and has low standards for their employees. Clothe your staff appropriately and teach them what customer service means. I will never bother going back here but I have never been so blatantly ignored anywhere before Steel Cactus. We left and went to another bar close by where we received amazing service and they were shorter staffed and busier than Steel Cactus. Steel Cactus is pathetic."}
{"text":"The tacos were ok except the serving size was pretty small. I'm not even a big eater and I didn't feel full by the end of the meal. The service was pretty bad. Even for a glass of water, you'd have to stand up, walk to the bar and ask them to fill it for you."}
{"text":"Not as great as the Southside location.  Our food took an incredibly long time to come out, and my breakfast burrito was served with rice instead of breakfast potatoes, which I've never seen before.  I've had brunch at the Steel Cactus in Southside probably 10 times... definitely enjoyed the service and environment there more."}
{"text":"Had a nice time here last Saturday with my bf...sat at a high top table in the bar, great for people watching. Hannah was our server and she was very  nice..also, awesome bloody Mary! I guess the days of free chips and salsa are long gone, but we got some anyway..they were just ok...tacos were good, but everything seemed way too salty. Probably come back for drinks and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to Steel this past Friday. The food was great (so many vegan options), but the highlight was our server, Jordan. She was so accommodating and willing to make our entire experience a positive one. Will be back in the near future - for the food & great service!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for drinks, but have never been impressed with the quality of drinks or service.  The drinks have been on the weaker side, and seem overpriced outside of happy hour.  I've had the margaritas, and they aren't as good as the ones at Mad Mex.  I believe they do offer free chips and salsa, and they haven't been remarkable.  I haven't ordered other food here, so I can't comment on its quality.  Obviously, the main draw here is the rooftop bar, which can be a fun place to hang out on weekend nights, and offers a nice view of Walnut Street.  Be forewarned, however, that it gets busy at these times.  For rooftop dining and drinks, I recommend BRGR in East Liberty, which offers a more relaxed atmosphere, and better food/drinks.  The Chinese restaurant across the street also has a rooftop deck, though I've never been there, so I can't offer an opinion.  Overall, not a place I'd go out of my way to patronize--there are many other places in Shadyside and East Liberty offering better drinks, service, and ambiance, and many better, more genuine Mexican places."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the pork tacos here and the mango signature drink (perfect for people who like fruity/sweet drinks like me). The salsa was also really good. I'll be back to try more, but I did enjoy my first experience so I'm giving it 4 stars for now."}
{"text":"I had a celebration with ten friends here last night.  Food is an issue. Ordered hard shell tacos, but I was told they don't have hard shells, only \"soft tacos with corn kernels,\" which were not crunchy or satisfying at all. The beans were watery, and the rice was inedible for me, like quinoa grains mixed with undercooked rice and a Mexican flavoring. I took a box to be polite and gave it away.  Service was OK. Server was nice enough, but I asked him to do something special for my friend's birthday, and he waited until after the checks arrived. One of the girls actually tried to leave once we got the bill, and it was awkward to explain she couldn't go yet without saying why. Not a big deal, but it could have been handled better.  Best part was the drinks. More of a chips and salsa and drinks place than anything else, honestly."}
{"text":"If you're the type of person who likes the ambience and environment of a restaurant, then this is a great choice. It's hip, trendy, conveniently located right on East Carson Street, and has modern fixtures and open air dining and a balcony. There are almost always a ton of young people here -- it just has that vibe.  But if you're a foodie who is looking for well-done Americanized Mexican, I prefer Emiliano's down the road. And if you crave authentic Mexican, la palapa is also nearby. I've had the nachos, tacos, and margaritas here, and none hold a candle from a culinary perspective to other restaurants in a one-mile radius. I only enjoy the guacamole and skinny margaritas here, and, well, that's not a lot.  Service here could also be better -- I hosted a party for twelve of my friends here earlier in the year, and there were several complaints amongst the group that the drinks and the food were slow. We did have a lot of people, though, so take it as you will."}
{"text":"The food is par. The service needs a lot of help. From the time I walked in the door till I walked out was 1.5 hours on a Monday night. Really!!!!!  I ask for my check and 15 mins later it came. I'm from San Diego and life does not move this slow anyplace."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place.  But since I am a baseball fan, I usually end up here before or after a baseball game due to its proximity to the ballpark.  It is the same disappointing experience every time. Food and service can best be described as mediocre.    They rush to take your order the second you are seated, even though you haven't even opened the food or drink menu yet. Once you do place the order, it seems like eternity before your food arrives.  What is even more frustrating, is that we ordered items that were supposed to be easier and quicker to prepare. Not sure what the time frame would have been for items more complicated.   I understand that game day dining can be hectic and the service is compromised, but an order of nachos shouldn't be swimming in water due to improperly washed and drained lettuce.  I asked for a side of rice and beans, and was told by the server she would see what she could do.  Steel Cactus is spacious and offers great outdoor dining, but it certainly needs to step up on their game."}
{"text":"The service was the only good thing about our dinner. Awful food. Weak and skimpy flavorless specialty (expensive) cocktails. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Food was average, and waiter wasn't the best. Probably would not be back for the food, but it was fun for the drinks!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend and our children (4 kids combined). The service was outstanding. Our server Emily was attentive and went above and beyond to make our clan feel welcome and comfortable. Great kids menu with delicious grilled cheese and chicken fingers. My friend and I both had tacos that were outstanding...I was happy to have so many vegetarian choices with tofu included as a protein option for all of the dishes. (And it was cooked perfectly) Lunch prices were very reasonable. If I had to find a fault I would say that the sides were lackluster, but the tacos were so fresh tasting it didn't matter."}
{"text":"Sooooooo bad. The food is really really gross (my avocados were brown) and it is very over priced for what they actually give you. I had to send my tofu tacos back, and I'm not even that kind of person. For a side of queso and a side of rice my bill came out to $16"}
{"text":"If you're looking for $11 chips and salsa (found a hair in the chips) that takes 25 minutes to come out, warm guiness, and a bathroom that smells like Hiroshima, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Really good happy hour specials, I am doing low carb and the really nice bartender helped me pick a delicious grilled chicken salad. The chicken was marinated and actually had char lines from a real grill- hungry again just thinking about it! Hostesses always so friendly and helpful! Upstairs on deck is nice too... Chairs up there not so great if you're old or overweight but hey there's options ya know! Always had really good food here, been a bunch of times, fun late night too!"}
{"text":"I wish there was only a half of start; because I would put that. And here's why:   Asked for a Paloma but the bartender said 'that's tequila and grape juice.... You can do better.... I'll make you something' ten minutes later he comes back with a glass that has a hint of something orange in it with the taste of pure vodka. I told him I liked fruity drinks and I get straight liquor.  We got our order, waited five minutes to get silverware and by that time my six shrimp that were in my flour tortilla (too bad I ordered corn tortillas) were cold. The rice was dried out, the beans were straight from the can with a little Parmesan cheese on top. I watched the male bartender throw ice across the bar length wise hitting some guests sitting at the bar. Then I proceeded to watch him make a mix drink and right when he strains the drink; he uses his fingers to cover the mouth of the container and use his fingers as a stopper for the ice. My experience was terrible. The bartender said right before he gave us our check 'should I get my manager over here for you so you can bitch more about me?' I replied ' ya, that'd be nice!' Good luck with this place. And good luck if Dustin is your bartender/ waiter/ or whatever his part time job requires him to do."}
{"text":"So I used to love going to steel cactus solely for the vibe and rooftop bar, especially in the warmer months.  The atmosphere has always been laid back and not so \"collegey\" as other bars which I loved.  Recently, a group of us decided to get drinks there before getting ready for a wedding event.  This was earlier in the day around noon. This is the time we first encountered a not so nice hostess.  She was very stand offish but we continued to the rooftop.  The bartender up there was very attentive and did a wonderful job.  We just had basic mimosas which were alright and bloody Marys which were below average.  The sun was pretty intense that day so a lot of our friends wanted to move out of the sun downstairs.  We had to go get one of our phones fixed at the apple store and called it a day and left, but when the phone took longer than expected we decided to go back into SC but on the regular restaurant level.  Now mind you, at this point in the day there was maybe one to two full tables of people, that's it.  It was DEAD. We wanted to get more drinks but there wasn't enough seats clustered together at the bar so we asked this hostess if we could just sit at the table because clearly none were being used.  We realized (as she so rudely explained) that tables were for people who are eating, but Since there were no other customers we didn't see a problem.  I have never met a hostess who was so blatantly rude for no good reason seeing we were very nice and understanding while talking to her.  With angry sighs, multiple eye rolls, and an attitude she basically shrugged us off and told us to do what we wanted.  We ended up standing at a high table by the bar in the corner to where we were greeted with more rude eye rolls from one of the waitresses.  But guess what...it didn't even get busy to where we were hindering other customers eating.    Other than that bad experience, I've always had an okay time at steel cactus.  Their food is okay, I definitely wouldn't choose it as a place to get Mexican food."}
{"text":"I'm glad I had great company to spend my rare weekly lunch outside of work because food was blah. The cheese on my burrito had to be Velveeta... it tasted so wrong! The rice accompanying the burrito had a strange flavor.  I have to give it to them, the chips and salsa were better.  Then, to make our experience more weird they opened the window; in the middle of the winter. I guess the guys in the kitchen were hot. Haven't they heard of a fan?  It's a trendy place. The layout reminded me of the old Cozumel. I miss that place. Now that was a mexican restaurant!   Service was ok, but I guess it's because they only had three tables to wait.  I give them 2 stars for the chips and salsa. Way to go!"}
{"text":"Steel Cactus on Walnut Street was fantastic.  We started off with the dip trio (salsa, guacamole,  and queso) with delicious tortilla chips.  I can honestly say this was the best guacamole I have ever had. I had three beef tacos served gringo style as my entree. It was slightly hotter than I expected but delicious.  Out dessert was the fried oreos. All I can say about that is ...yummy. I highly recommend Steel Cactus for the drinks (Yinzer margarita was delicious although could use a tad more alcohol), the food,  and the service (our server Courtney was awesome). We were also"}
{"text":"We went back a second time.  Same server - Ben.  I see a lot of reviews displeased with the service...but Ben is stellar.  Friendly, attentive...he even tried to get them to change the TV station so my husband could watch the pirates game from the particular TV that was facing our table.    In terms of my last review - I took those chips/salsa home and continued to eat them all weekend.  Still good even a few days later.   This time I got the taco salad and it was very good.  I've always been a fan of the fried tortilla bowl and this did not disappoint.  The chipotle ranch is a bit funky...smoky maybe?  Next time I'd go with regular ranch, but overall, I very much enjoyed my taco salad.  Really...it didn't even NEED dressing.  Despite all the less than stellar reviews, I still like this place."}
{"text":"Flat beer, Mexican food with no flavor, and terrible service. We liked the atmosphere but that was about it. Was nice to sit with the garage style doors open and enjoy the warmth and sunshine in February."}
{"text":"I visited here about a month ago with friends and we were all disappointed that their staff did not inform us of the price change for their yinzerita's. I come here quite often and i am also a server at a different restaurant. Personally, i would notify my guests if a drink or food item went up in price. Especially when the menu clearly states the old price."}
{"text":"The Last Straw...  I am always dragged to the steel Cactus on Walnut Street by my coworkers, I have tried my best to give this place a chance over the past year.  The men's bathroom door upstairs does not lock. The men's bathroom door downstairs will not stay shut. Very few times has there been hot water to wash your hands in the restroom and sometimes there is no water available at all. Not long ago  there  was a guy  with a bulldog  in the restaurant, one of my co-workers has a severe allergy  to pet dander  and we asked if we could be moved to a different table. After a few inquiries  it was revealed that that indeed was not a service dog  but it was a pet of one of the owners and he always had his dog in the dining rm. He was quite rude and disrespectful in a typical d-bag fashion. The employees were very apologetic. I wish he would have seen it again so I could have called the health department. All Summer Long there was a temporary cooling tube strung through the ceiling, it was discustingand always dripped condensation on the customers. The upstairs deck floor it's so filthy and disgusting it makes do you want to throw up. The retractable roof was never retracted all summer and there are several broken panels patched with plywood covered in black mold. Last spring only a couple of the heaters were working, and this past fall only 2 of the heaters worked and unsafe kerosene torpedo heaters were strewn around the deck. Last night we came in and the front door would not shut and we can see our breath all the way to the top of the stairs. The poor guy at the door was inside and had many sweatshirts and jackets on to try to stay warm. We tried to go upstairs and we're informed that it was closed. I mentioned that the reason why we enjoy the place is for the for the upstairs deck. An employee apologized and said that the pipes were frozen and it could not be opened. We all turned and walked back out the door. I will now only visit this establishment to do my own inspections and see if anything has changed. According to the employees I spoke with over the last year, they probably will not."}
{"text":"This place was horrible.  I wish I could tell u how the food was but after over a 10 minute wait without seeing a waitress we left. It wasn't even half full. Awful service to say the least. There were 3 women standing at the hostess station drinking soda and talking and the only waiter we saw was too busy talking to the table near us the whole time we were there to be bothered. Don't bother with this place and hit up the the pub chip shop across the street. Also the bathrooms were disgusting"}
{"text":"I have driven past this place on East Carson Street countless times and always catch myself looking inside at how lovely the atmosphere is.  I decided to stop one Friday evening and try it out.  I was greeted by a friendly host and decided to sit at the bar.  Alyssa took very good care of me and the group I was with. We had made it in time for their awesome happy hour specials that run from 5-7 pm. She was very sweet and attentive. With her recommendation I tried one of their specialty drinks, the captains hurricane which was delicious and my friend decided on a strawberry mango yinzerita, which also was a great choice!  We tried out the dip trio as an appetizer, which comes with queso(delicious with a little spice to it), guac and your choice of salsa. Loved all of these.   Fajitas are a go-to of mine so I tried out the chicken ones here.  Came out in a timely manner, Portion was plenty to fill me up, and they were very tasty!   I enjoyed the atmosphere and decor inside.  I was pleased with my experience here and I most definitely will be back for another visit with friends."}
{"text":"I think this place is underrated.  1.  good happy hour, cheap drinks and wine to choose from.  I had the pineapple something...yum! $5 with pinepple bits and vodka.  Be careful, it sneaks up on you!  2.  1/2 off apps, several people were eating nachos; I ordered the chicken quesadilla.  I wasnt expecting much, but it was good.  Thick and full with fesh ingredients and flavor. a little spice, lots of chicken.  3.  Feeling hopeful I ordered the carmel cheesecake chimichangas for dessert.  Once again, I'm shocked!  I got three rolls, warm and fresh, topped with sauce, and tasting delicious.    4.  Service was perfectly fine. It was packed on a Friday and CMU was having an event there so the drinks took a little longer than the food, but.....SOOOO what?  Everyone seems to be complaining about the service; hey I'm from Chicago, maybe I'm so used to being treated crappy that this place seems great to me...  5.  My waiter.  Cute little curly haired guy with glasses.  He couldn't remember anything, but he was adorable. Only thing I would improve is the cleanliness.  The chairs were full of food and waitress wiped the table with the dirty chair cloth - ew!"}
{"text":"I am giving 3 out of 5 because of the service & drinks. The bartender was not attentive & gave us skunked beer. Good conversation with friends, the roof top bar, & the queso dip made up for it."}
{"text":"Moved jobs and had to find a place to eat in Northside. Everyone told me that this place sucks but I have to give it some kudos...first tacos. I'm happy to have TACOS within walking distance of work! Also, happy hour. They have $3 glasses of wine and a bunch of other discounted drinks. I couldn't find a happy hour appetizer menu though....  Finally, no one is there at night. It's quiet. Everyone is down the street at Souther Tier and such. This place is clearly a game bar as its in PNC Park. So my service was tremendous! The staff was super attentive and the food was pretty good too.  The one thing I have to say is that they tend to run out of things fast. First time is was bacon, second the keg was kicked."}
{"text":"Being a buiness man on the go I must say that this Catus is  really efficient with great customer service. The food is quickly served and always very good !"}
{"text":"My new friend and I went here after having a very disappointing experience in another nearby restaurant.    What a pleasant surprise!!  The service was great, the food in expensive, and DELICIOUS! Nothing fancy ... Just simple good tasting tex- mex food! Yummy! We WILL be returning!!"}
{"text":"I visited this establishment as part of a Yelp tasting event.   I got to sample a chicken taco with corn, lettuce, red cabbage, and what tasted like a sour cream drizzle on top. My favorite part of the taco was the red cabbage- it was so tangy and flavorful that I can't believe it isn't a staple thing on a taco because it should be! The corn was very nice as well.  The chicken was just okay for me (not a huge fan of dark meat chicken), though I did like the spices on it. I also enjoyed the soft tortilla. I typically don't really like them, but this tortilla tasted very fresh and didn't have that weird smell that packaged tortillas have.    The chicken taco was served with a side of very crunchy, delicious tortilla chips.  They were not too salty and I enjoyed them even without any sauces or salsas for dipping.   The chef who served the tacos was very friendly and took the time to explain a little bit about the menu as well as the taco they created for us to try.  Thank you Steel Cactus for giving me the opportunity to sample your food.  I hope to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Good drinks. Great margaritas. Brie at the bar was especially accommodating."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: the review is about their brunch menu, although I think their Mexican menu is also very subpar. Take the extra drive and go to Mad Mex if you don't want to be disappointed.   Would give 0 stars if I could--do yourself a favor and never come here for breakfast/brunch.  Steel Cactus used to have good breakfast with fresh eggs and enormous fluffy pancakes. My visit today was extremely unpleasant.   The pancake was not only smaller, but the batter was gritty and had an off taste to it. Also they definitely made the pancakes on the same grill as the ones they cook their meat.   Also they must have thought that using powdered eggs while charging the same amount of money is okay. The scrambled \"eggs\" were cold, gritty, dry and chalky. Definitely the most disgusting thing I received today.   Disappointment really, since this was a nice alternative to standing in line at other breakfast places on Walnut"}
{"text":"Had to try another one, a beer and spicey, crunchy, made to perfection nachos. Love steel Cactus, for fun at this location!!!"}
{"text":"Bottom line: the steel cactus is nothing special. The food is average and over priced. HOWEVER, their frozen margs are awesome. The regular frozen marg is so fresh and tastes like it has real lemon and lime juice in it. That's refreshing to me considering most Mexican restaurants have very artificial tasting margs.   Overall, I'd only go to steel cactus if it was happy hour. They seem to have pretty good specials and the drinks are wayyy better than the food."}
{"text":"Came on a unusually warm Friday night in February. It seems like everyone was out at the south side. When we arrived the hostess told us it would be an hour wait. There were several open tables which she said were for reservations. We found out the rest of our party was upstairs at the bar. We joined them and found that there was an entire upstairs section that was open and empty.   We still went ahead and sat at the bar. The bartender was so f%^*ing rude. If I actually wasn't with a group of people I would of left. He took our drink orders and we told him we wanted to order food too. It took us about 15 mins to get a drink. After we got tired of waiting on him to take our order we asked a waitress if we could sit at one of the many empty tables. After she told us that normally you have to put your name in with the hostess to get a table she let us sit. The bartender flipped out on her and us! It's clear this place doesn't care about customer service.  The food is average. The drinks are the only positive about this place. I won't be surprised when they got out of businesses. Save your time and money and skip this place!"}
{"text":"This place had great potential for it's location but completely missed the boat on the food and drink menu. Do yourself a favor and drive or walk down to Mad Mex.  The food here is mediocre at best. I've been here multiple times and the service has been lacking each time."}
{"text":"The service was a little slow, the drinks were good, the prices were right, the food was meh. I'm from CA I've heard our Mexican food is pretty authentic here, but I got a chicken quesadilla... How can you screw that one up right? Should be easy... well the chicken inside was weird and not seasoned like Mexican food should be seasoned. It just wasn't what I was expecting... at all.  Alas, maybe the kitchen was off, or I'm used to the amazing food back where I live, but it was just ehhh. I wouldn't order food here again, but you can't go wrong with a yinzerita from here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots. I usually take co-workers from out of town and they always leave happy. Great for entertaining large groups. Great service. I highly suggest the Molcajete bowl. It comes out sizzling and the verde sauce is to die for. We never leave without having at least one Yinzerita. A must try!"}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting worse each time I visit.  It's not authentic Mexican food at all, nor is it fresh.  Save your money and go somewhere else, unless you would just like a drink.  I do like the atmosphere here though.  However, the food is horrible."}
{"text":"Guacamole tasted bland. Salsa was like tomato pur√©e. Do not recommend this place. Limited menu, not much to choose from"}
{"text":"I have literally never had Mexican food - no, food in general, this bad in my life.  I am from Texas. I have tons of Mexican family. I was in a very long term relationship with a Mexican and went to every family gathering and reunion. I know what good Mexican food is.   The first red flag for me was there there was not a single Mexican in the building. Staff or patrons. Ok, I'm not racist so I'll give it a chance. My dad makes great Mexican food and he's white.   We sat down and our waitress greeted us 5 minutes later.  She was nice enough but very unknowledgeable on the menu. Told us there weren't pinto beans. WTF? 15 minutes later she says oh actually I just found out we DO have pinto beans. You're a 'Mexican' restaurant, duh you have pinto beans.  Our appetizer comes out, which is chips and salsa we have to pay for (weird but ok). Chips were a bad texture, salsa was ok. My fianc√© liked it but I did not due to taste.  Our entree comes out. We ordered the steak fajitas, medium rare, with a couple of sides.   I'm not kidding you. Everything was horrible.  The steak had this weird sweet flavor. It was tough as hell and other than the gross sweetness, it had no flavor.   The rice was some weird white person take on Mexican rice with all these vegetables in them. It tasted bad and was clearly overcooked. The refried beans were more authentic when it came to the texture, but they were flavorless. The flour tortillas were DISGUSTING. They tasted like the kind you buy in a bag from the grocery store shelf. The guacamole was the best thing, but that's not saying much. It was way oversalted, but I thought, that's better than the rest of this flavorless crap.  This is not Mexican food.  I was pretty disgusted and the waitress came over and asked how everything was which was nice. I told her we didn't like any of it, we couldn't eat it. She said she would get her manager.   Her manager came over after a couple minutes in plaid shorts and flip flops (weird but ok). He was nice and asked us if he could give us anything else. I was like, please no. I told him where i was from and he proceeded to kind of insult me by saying \"Yeah, it's a little bit of Tex-Penn Mex!\" And I was like no. Have you ever eaten Texmex? This is not anywhere near Texmex. It's disgusting. Come to Texas.  I didn't say that, but I was thinking it.  The waitress was really sweet and apologetic.  Anyways, I hated eating here with a passion. There is a Mexican flag painted on the wall and there shouldn't be. This place has absolutely NOTHING to do with Mexico. In any way. At all.   I don't recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I met a group for drinks on a Monday night. Our server, Ashley, was awesome -- attentive and friendly, even with our fairly rowdy group (for a Monday night).  Steel Cactus' drinks tend towards quantity over quality. I ordered a Dark and Stormy, which came in a 16 oz glass filled with ginger ale and a shot of rum. I would have rather had something half the size with double the flavor."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Nice little venue for sure, but it's expensive for tex-mex, the high table chairs upstairs are horrific. Seriously, i'd rather sit on a jagged boulder.  Overall 3 stars, the venue is very nice, food decent..."}

But upon ordering 3 apps we were charged full price, and correcting it was a big deal. Our server was nice but was covering the outside tables and inside tables....food was cold and some of it was inedible.....go across the street to Local Brewhouse ...amazing food and service!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great dining experience...it is so hard to find good Mexican, especially in the South Side where there is a Mexican restaurant on every block...this is by far the best!  Service: Great, the hostess was very friendly and welcoming, our server Drew was amazing, warm, genuine, hip, attentive, never an empty glass, new the menu, very nice.  Atmosphere: Awesome, dark, with lots of fun lighting, not tacky though, really cool big round booths, cool bar, high tops, fun and trendy, good music  Food: Actually very good, I saw \"actually\" b/c I didn't expect such good food from a South Side bar, but it was very very good. Lots of unique taco selections; mahi mahi with pineapple salsa were great. BF had brisket and fried jalapeno tacos which were fantastic. The Trio dip appetizer was nice, salsa, guac, cheese, all fresh and super tasty. Very impressed.   Drinks: We stopped in quick, no time to drink b/c work, but I am dying to try their nice margarita menu...good happy hour specials.   Super cool place, will definitely be a new go to spot!"}
{"text":"After visiting the nearby Warhol Museum, we stopped in to get out of the sun and grab a bite to eat. While I'm not a huge fan of mexican food in the middle of the day, the Chicken Burrito with hot queso hit the spot. Additionally, their chips and guac were pretty stellar too. I only had a lemonade, but from the looks of their bar and alcohol selection, they seem to know what their doing. The only real bad thing I can say against them was that I wish I knew about this place before going to a game!"}
{"text":"Immediately walked in and wasn't carded which is unprofessional and against the law!  Ordered a frozen margarita thinking its a Mexican place and it should be good. It was like drinking a frozen orange Julius with no tequila in it. Go to mad mex. I hope when trump builds the wall that steel cactus is beyond the wall."}
{"text":"I went with friends for drinks and ordered the cran-apple mojito. It was not very good and tasted like juice. The previous time I dined was no different. I ordered the fish tacos which is pretty simple...... WRONG. The flavors were horrible and did not blend. This will be my last time giving Steel Cactus a chance."}
{"text":"Stay away unless you want just Chips and Salsa. Sat down at 1:25 on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Surprise! They don't serve lunch until 2pm!?!? Who does that?? They force you into a mediocre brunch menu....unless you want to wait. Too hungry, we ordered brunch. I had the eggs and chorizo burrito .  It was cold. When I asked the waiter to heat it up, he said he would have another one made. They head waiter came out and told me the likely reason was that they put avocado Guacamole on it and that made the rest of it cold. When they brought out the new one, it had the guacamole on the side. It sounds like a lot of people have sent it back. Even the Redone one was not that good. It was dried out chorizo and eggs were like warm. The other people in my party got other items that were just as mediocre. The only redeeming quality of this place is the chips and salsa. The bathrooms smell like a fraternity house bar, and are about just as clean. If you want decent Mexican food, I suggest going to southside."}
{"text":"Steel Cactus sits in a great location on Walnut Street in Shadyside. You have to walk up a few flights of steps once you get there but this place has some cool decor and two floors of seating. The top floor is the roof and my friend and I decided that a second flight up was worth it to enjoy a perfect day.   This trip to Steel Cactus was purely in the name of happy hour. Too bad we were there a little early for happy hour (starts at 5PM) so we couldn't get the reduced price.  No worries, that wouldn't stop me from ordering Pumking on tap!  We decided to share an order of chicken nachos to offset the high ABV content of said Pumking and I'd rate the nachos a 2.5 out of 5. Definitely not the best ever.   I don't often mention restrooms in my reviews but I must say the bathroom at Steel Cactus was sparkling clean. Like, you could eat your nachos off the floor clean. Also, good friendly service to be found here.   Good happy hour destination and if the weather is nice I highly recommend heading up to the roof."}
{"text":"Was hesitant based on other reviewers, but decided to give it a try.  Never been to a Mexican Restaurant that charged for chips & salsa ($4.00).  I could get over it, but it was very bland.  Burrito was also bland.  Why would they serve a wet burrito on paper?  It was a mess!  Not something I would recommend."}
{"text":"I had no idea that a second Steel Cactus had opened in Pittsburgh until a coworker of mine suggested meeting here with a group last Sunday evening.  I had no problem finding a parking spot on the street (at 5pm on a Sunday afternoon), but if you came at a busier time, you could also park at a public lot just a block away. Like all amp'd group restaurants, the new Steel Cactus is well decorated and has a trendy vibe while still keeping with a Mexican theme. I also enjoyed sitting with a view of Carson Street and people-watching from time to time throughout the meal.  Though this is a fun place to hang out, the food and drinks are just mediocre. I had a sangria (white peach, I believe?) that was tasty but was very sweet and tasted very light on the alcohol content. My margarita was also very sub-par, and one of my coworkers actually sent hers back to be remade. We split chips and three dips, which were very tasty. I do like Steel Cactus's style of queso - mild, smooth, white cheese - and also enjoyed trying a pineapple salsa. Finally, for my meal, I ordered the chicken fajitas, which were very light on the chicken and heavy on the saut√©ed/grilled onions and peppers.  Though a little slow, service was descent, especially considering that we were a confusing bunch. We anticipated more people than actually arrived.... Everyone arrived in 10 minute intervals over a half hour period of time.... We had a groupon.... We sent a drink back.... The groupon holder actually had to leave early, before we all paid our checks.... Even with all this randomness, our waiter did a good job keeping up.  Overall, this Steel Cactus would have a lot going for it if they improved their food and drink quality. I would really just plan on returning to order their chips with three dips and maybe a drink."}
{"text":"Don't come to the Steel Cactus and expect to be blown away by quality of food or service. However, I do have to say that I've enjoyed my several experiences here and would recommend this restaurant as a fun place for late night drinks or a Saturday afternoon snack. The drinks that I've had from here have been good, and I've enjoyed ordering the nachos a couple of times."}
{"text":"The food came quickly and was really good. A fine queso option. The service however is a bit forced, and not genuine. The server was on her phone, taking selfies, not paying attention to her tables. Polite enough, but it seemed like a common theme there. Regardless, the food proved to be filling and tasty."}
{"text":"Get the Molcajete Bowl and you won't be disappointed. It's definitely enough to share with 3 people and worth every penny. I've never had anything like it before. If you're in the area on the weekend definitely also stop in for brunch. The breakfast nachos are spot on."}
{"text":"Food was so, so. Margarita was straight tequila (though I did enjoy). Five star because I'm not a jerk."}
{"text":"It's impossible to go into Steel Cactus for the first time without comparing it to a well-loved Pittsburgh staple, Mad Mex.  Things that I prefer about Steel Cactus:  -Happy hour.  I almost don't want to mention it here so it doesn't get crowded, but they pour a hefty glass of wine for just $3. Other drinks are also reasonably priced and the appetizers are 1/2 off.  It's great. -Service.  I've sat at both the bar and dining area, and the service was great at both locations.  It did take a while for drinks to come out, but our food was served right away. -Tacos.  They double-wrap their tacos, and I think the use a corn tortilla instead of a flour one.  Delicious.  Steel Cactus can improve on a few things: -Menu.  It's not a huge menu, which I usually prefer, but I wish there were more vegetarian options.  The tacos were good though.  The guacamole was just okay.  They had a great choice of salsas, and the one we had (there was corn in it! was great). -Drinks.  I had a regular margarita on the rocks and it wasn't the best.  My friends' specialty cocktails were also on the sweet side.  I'm not giving up on Steel Cactus just yet.  Their happy hour is great and I still have to try their other 4 salsas!"}
{"text":"Just skip it. The food was okay (needed a squeeze of citrus at the least) but our waitress was a mess from start to finish. Didn't introduce herself just asked for our drink order. She sent our food to another table and after we ate she sent another table's food to our table. She never checked on us once or asked how the food was or asked if we wanted another drink order but had time to check her phone and chat with coworkers...they got a smile from her, we didn't see one...then she dropped off the bill and took a very long time to come back for payment. I thought the restaurant template was to increase sales by 1. bringing more drinks and 2. turning tables over. Oh well. We'll try another restaurant next time."}
{"text":"So I came here with some friends and my fiance to enjoy their rooftop bar. The service was literally non existent. After 20 minutes we were finally able to put in an order of chips and salsa and it literally took 30 minutes to come out to our table. No one ever came to see if we needed drink refills or silverware, plates, napkins, nothing. We literally never got any of that. There was no manager in sight to speak with either.  The worst part was, it wasn't busy. It was during a Penguins playoff game. Half their tvs werent functional. They absolutely should have been expecting a crowd and they were horribly incapable of providing any service to us or any of the tables around us. When we arrived, there were tables covered in dirty dishes that were still untouched when we left an hour later. When we were finally able to flag any employee down to get our server over to us so that we could pay and leave; it genuinely took them 15 minutes to run our card. How is that even possible? At this point in expecting to find fraudulent charges on my account soon given how long they held my card for.  I can't express my dissatisfaction enough. I will never visit the restaurant again. I will likely never visit a steel cactus again either. If I could I would give zero stars. Stay away. Please don't give this place your business. I hope a sink hole swallows exclusively this business,  because I rather enjoy the neighborhood."}
{"text":"While settling our daughter here at The University Pittsburgh we came across a restaurant that looked very inviting nice atmosphere . The hostess welcomed us and sat us where we wanted.  Didnt even wait for service as soon.as we sat down. Heather the name of our server took.care of us asap with a smile as if we were regulars . One of the things my husband and I look for is making sure we have what we need yet not interrupting us every 3 minutes .  Heather anticipated our needs and served us with what we appreciate to be Great work ethics. We will be back again :)"}
{"text":"During lunch today, 4 of my coworkers and I decided to have a nice lunch to celebrate my birthday. We arrived at 11:40 and were promptly seated in the outdoor area. As it was before noon there weren't too many people there yet. The waitress came and took our drink order.   She did not come back with our drinks for 15 minutes (which was not at all complicated). She then took our food orders and we all ordered tacos.   A group also consisting of 5 people came in around the time we were being given our drinks, ordered their food, paid, and LEFT and we still didn't have our food.   The waitress basically forgot about our table and 2 of my coworkers had to go to the bar to order more drinks. At this point, we have been there for an hour and a half and still no food. One of my coworkers went to the hostess to ask to speak to a manager and she IGNORED HIM. Finally, the hostess comes over to our table and asks us \"what's wrong?\" like she had no idea we've been sitting in front of her for so long. Another colleague frustratingly told her about everything and she just stared at us without so much as an apology. We only have an hour for lunch and were being completely neglected. We got up and left without our ever receiving our food because the staff refused to acknowledge there was a problem.   I have never done that in my life and this was honestly the worst restaurant experience I have ever had.  EDIT: I wrote to the restaurant and the manager quickly responded saying that they were training in the kitchen and ran into some issues. While that in iteself is understandable (and we would have understood if the staff had told us) that fact remains that the waitress and the hostess repeatedly ignored us and clearly had no problem with several groups of people walking out due to lack of service."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food but this was very sad. The waitress completely forgot to put in our chips and queso and blamed the kitchen. Our tacos came out and the 2 that I ordered weren't even the same (which is ordered 2 of the same tacos). My fianc√© ordered $2.50 taco Tuesday tacos. He ordered 3 and got 2. The bonus: he was not supposed to get rice and beans but he did. The beans were terrible. The rice was good. The chips and queso finally came  out right before our food. We got the 3rd taco they forgot and they made 2 instead of 1. Okay, cool, we got extra tacos but he can't eat tomatoes which he told the waitress when she took our order. It was a cluster. $52 later... I'm sorely disappointed in this place. It's not hard to make some tacos... not sure if it was her first day but it was bad. I tipped her well but don't feel bad for posting how terrible the restaurant was. Think long and hard about this place... I wouldn't waste my money here ever again!"}
{"text":"I like this place's happy hour because it is a good deal. The happy hour food and yinzeritas are decent.   If that was all I got there then I would give them 4 stars, but the service is pretty slow and the bartenders don't pay attention to you even when the bar is empty. Also, do not get a \"top-shelf\" margarita here, I have tried 3 different bartenders and the manager and they cannot make one. All of  them so sweet that they weren't drinkable."}
{"text":"The only compliment I can give this place is that the guacamole is good.  Other than that, here's a summary of our experience.  We had a rooftop reservation, showed up and our table was set inside the restaurant.  I get that mix ups happen, they kindly said they'll put something together on the rooftop so we waited.  Our table was set then no one came to tell us we could be seated, so we had to ask if we were allowed to sit down.  The manager gave us a complimentary pitcher of margaritas (nice gesture) but they were no good, not mixed well and barely any alcohol in them.  Like I said, guac was good.  After waiting almost an hour for our food, the tacos were pretty bland, some luke warm and some cold, none of them were hot at all.  Not a good experience here."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Kind of pricey if you ask me especially for food that taste just okay. The bar is pretty fun though. I was just there with family in shady side and the bouncer was mad cool. The bartenders were really nice as well. Sunday brunch is pretty cool. I mean the food is not terrible but I just don't think it matches the price well."}
{"text":"Came here with some coworkers at peak time on a Wednesday night. We were seated immediately on what looked like a busy night. There was music playing and yet it wasn't loud enough that you couldn't carry a conversation. Food was fairly priced and the brisket tacos were good. The sides were a little bland compared to the entree but I'm not picky. The house guacamole was good though too. Our wait staff was  courteous and had our food out to use promptly as well. Really nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Very cool! I loved the two floors especially the top floor. Just didn't like the yinzerita. I hate beer so when my friend brought me that was all beer and a tiny bit of purple slush i wasn't thrilled. But very cool spot with nice vibe in Shadyside."}
{"text":"Great drinks Great service Been here 2xs now and the food was cold, both times. I'm not one to focus on the negative but Im worried about getting sick from not being too hot."}
{"text":"Yikes! the food quality and service at this joint was awful! The interior and exterior of the place looks amazing and fresh, honestly a job well done, love the all woodwork. That being said I felt like I have had better at Taco Bell. No joke. The meat was dry as a Steel Cactus would be if you tried to eat it, sauces tasted like they were out of a jar, cheese tasted moldy. One of the guest at our table said his taco tasted like it was dipped in perfume.. How do you mess up tacos"}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better.\" is actually a pretty good description; thanks Yelp. I have just never been impressed by Steel Cactus, and more often than not, let down. I really try not to go here, however, this place is popular amongst a group of people I spend some time with that work close by... so most of the time its me trying to persuade them into going somewhere else.   Being that it is in Shadyside, and on Walnut specifically, I'd expect it to be one of the best not only in taste, but also service. I honestly have to say Mad Mex is way better. I would expect this place to be better even if it weren't on Walnut.   My first time there I had the blackened mahi mahi with edamame succotash, cilantro rice, and a grilled lime... sounded fantastic on paper, but in reality it was quite bland and forgettable. I thought the lime would have at least enough juice left to squeeze on the fish, but it was just a piece of dry green pulp, so its inclusion was quite pointless. Sad to say, it was probably the most boring meal I've ever had. Same with the house chips, salsa, and guac, they are just lacking flavor and don't keep me wanting to eat them (and trust... I love me some chips & guac). On another occasion, I had their tacos - carne sarteneada. Containing: carne, guajillo pepper salsa, red onion confit, chipotle ranch, bleu cheese, & scallions. While a step up from the mahi mahi, it was nothing to write home about.  To their benefit, they do have a great space. I like the layout, everything looks nice. They have a great outdoor patio area, and I like their sangria. Their mixed drinks and margs I've found to be prettttty weak on the pour.  In all, I think Steel Cactus is out of place in this area, it belongs in the Southside or maybe some suburb where multiple good options are less prevalent."}
{"text":"I have only been here a couple of times, however that was enough to determine that Mad Mex is far superior in every way.Had nachos with chicken as an appetizer-rather flavorless and nothing special.I ate the \"3 amigos\" as my entree-1 beef minitaco, 1 carnitas minitaco, and 1 chicken minitaco. They were all very bland, the tortillas were soggy, and frankly the beef taco was inedible.Everything I have ever ordered at Mad Mex has been very tasty so since they are both so close to eachother in shadyside-walking distance in decent weather-I see absolutely no need to go to Steel Cactus-head right to Mad Mex!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Our first visit. We we're impressed. Great service and better food. The burrito was as good or better than Mad Mex. They had all kind if cool drinks. Recommend this place. I will be back."}
{"text":"Bartender was nice enough, however, the place was empty (should have had prompt service) and the food absolutely cold. Avoid the chorizo tacos w/ rice and beans. Not really worth the money for the quality against price. Great location; very average food."}
{"text":"The service is terrible every. single. time. Even when it is not crowded, I find myself waiting and waiting for service. The food is decent, but I would suggest Emiliano's down the street instead."}
{"text":"It's Tuesday night, 9 o'clock.. Pens are down 4-0 to the Rangers which means it's not busy!!! Yet, I waited 10+ minutes for A (meaning 1) margarita that isn't good... And then waiting oh, another 15 minutes for a bowl of soup and nachos. Not cool. I'm a server and if I worked here I would be back and forth wondering where my food is for the table and apologizing for the wait... that hasn't even happened. I live in Southside and I must say, this will not be a place I return to."}
{"text":"I visited this location for brunch a year ago when they first opened. We got there around 10:30 and they had the sign out on the sidewalk that said brunch 10-2 but the doors were locked. We returned at 11 and when we walked in the entire staff was gathered around the bar and saw us walk in but no one approached us to seat us till I asked if I should seat myself. They explained that they didn't have their brunch menus yet so they couldn't serve brunch. I ordered enchiladas off the lunch menu and they were cold.   I gave it a year and decided to go back today and give them another chance after being open for a year now. Took a while for our waitress to come over and take our order and brings our drinks. My friend and I ordered the breakfast nachos which was should have had sour cream on it but it didn't. We then ordered a carafe of mimosas and it took 15 minutes to get it. At that point we were done eating so we had to stay to finish it. Our waitress came over 2 times to ask if we were just hanging out as if she irritated we weren't leaving after paying.   Overall the food I would give a 2 star. The nachos barely had anything on them and it was missing ingredients. The taste also wasn't that great. The Bloody Mary bar wasn't much for $7-9 in comparison to other more elaborate Bloody Mary bars. The environment I would give maybe a 4. I think in the summer with the doors open it could be really nice. The service I would give a 2 because it was terrible both times."}
{"text":"We came here prior to a Pirates game on a Saturday afternoon during the 2016 season and the restaurant got crowded pretty fast. We were here from 1-2pm and there was a high traffic of people throughout that hour waiting for the gates to open. The great thing though is that not only do they have seating inside of the restaurant, but they also have seating outside.  Our stop here was brief, but we ordered 2 appetizers while we were here - The Traditional Guacamole and Nachos with Beef. Unfortunately, both appetizers were very disappointing. First, the Guac. The Guac appetizer came with a lot of tortilla chips, but the amount of Guac for it was very small. We were quite surprised at how little Guac was in the bowl, if you can call it that. In addition, the Guac lacked flavor and we had to salt it on our own to give it a little kick. The Nachos with Beef wasn't that much better. Once again, there were plenty of chips on the plate, but the lack of beef was disappointing. Some of the beef and ingredients were on the bottom, but the spread of the ingredients on the tortillas was still not as much as we would have liked. If anything, we enjoyed eating the chips with the Chohula Hot Sauce on the table more than we did with the Guac or Beef!  The critiques don't stop with the food though. The service wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. The waitress we had seemed semi-friendly, but we felt she checked up on us way too much constantly asking if we needed something else. In our 1 hour there, she probably came back to ask the same question about 5 times. We ordered 2 appetizers because we felt 1 would not have been enough monetarily with the both of us at a table, but the waitress was a bit too aggressive coming back to our table over and over again. Sometimes waiters/waitresses don't give enough attention, this was an example of TOO MUCH. Just when we thought she came by too often, when it came time to pay, she was no where to be found. I gave her my credit card, but she ended up going to other tables to take down orders and didn't return until 10-15 minutes later.  I hate saying these things about establishments, but the truth is the truth. Not only were we served below average appetizers, but the service was right there with the food. The good thing is that this restaurant has major potential and it's not out of their realm to fix these problems because they are definitely resolvable."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, food dislike, drinks dislike (not strong enough)..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before and it was okay. Service was pretty lousy and the food was meh. Went back today with some coworkers for lunch. I was a little worried due to all of the bad reviews. We were seated promptly and service was actually very good. Our waitress was attentive and took our orders quickly. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to come out. The food was a little better than I remembered, nothing special. I got the mexican cobb salad. The avocado in it was a little strange, I can't really pinpoint why. The jalapeno ranch was tasty. All and all I would come back but not as a first choice. Just felt like I should help redeem this place!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour spot. Probably my favorite in southside. They have half off appetizers and drink specials. You can't beat it! The atmosphere is a lot of fun which keeps us coming back. They have open windows and a rooftop bar.   The food is delicious and they have a lot of options for everyone (including vegetarian). Their queso is one of my favorites. Get the chicken nachos!!  Service here is mediocre at best. Last night they lost our food ticket, however the server did give us a round of beers which was nice."}
{"text":"Life changing for real this is not a joke. I left a different person.  I have been baptized in margaritas.  I am redeemed.  I am whole. I am Jesus Christ of Pittsburg.  Go steelers"}
{"text":"The service for the food took forever even tho we were the only few who ordered any food in the restaurant/bar. Extremely overpriced (should have expected it since it was on south side"}
{"text":"The onnnnnly reason this place is getting three stars and not two is because the service and management is fantastic, as well as their drink specials for happy hour. The atmosphere is also really nice, especially if you get to sit on the roof top during the warmer months.   I've visited several times for drinks only, and loved it. Went for food and it wasn't too great. Had the chips and guac (half off for happy hour!) which was really good, creamy and garlicky the way good guac should be. My two friends had the enchiladas and they both enjoyed them, but I did notice they were pretty small. My shrimp and Carnitas burrito didn't taste like Carnitas, but some other sort of mystery meat in some weird sauce. The shrimp were excellent, and if I ever give this place an order chance I will stick to only shrimp. And the sauce on top tasted like spaghetti sauce. Don't know what was up with that, but I was not a fan.   Like I said, service is great and so are drinks, so I'll probably be back in the warmer months, but I wouldn't call this a destination spot for food.   Oh, and if you're short and have short legs, do not attempt to sit at the high tables with the high chairs. Trust me on this one."}
{"text":"I don't have any complaints about Steel Cactus. It's pretty good food. Large quantities for a pretty inexpensive price. I also happened to come to this place for the first time during a trivia night. It was fun and also semi-depressing (I'm not sure why). The happy hour is good. I enjoyed the gauc. The burrito is worth a try. They moved quick.   I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if I'm hungry and happen to be by it . . . I'd come back. It serves that very needed purpose of having a lot of decent food for a decent price when you need it. At least it isn't McDonalds, which tries to serve the same purpose? (Ouch)"}
{"text":"We went down for happy hour and National Taco Day!  Parking: you can pay along Carson Street at the kiosks or in lots nearby.  Happy hour: 5-7, highlights include half off apps (except the dip trio) and $10 pitchers of margaritas.   Tip: check in on the Yelp app and get 10% off your food order. Not applicable for happy hour apparently but I would still try it!  The deal yesterday was all you can eat tacos for $10. You ordered in sets of 3 and could get anything from steak to chorizo to my favorite...carnitas. They were juicy and filling and delicious! I opted for corn tortillas and the chipotle aioli which was the bomb!  Definitely will be back for happy hour again and to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Don't come Down here tonight! 5$ cover, a line to get upstairs which they are letting 1 person an hour and they aren't even putting tequila in the margaritas"}
{"text":"Food is bland and the rice isn't cooked. Large portions but I feel like I \"have\" to eat the whole thing so I don't waste. I don't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I had an event for work scheduled here. I scheduled it weeks in advance, probably 6. Had it all set up. Then a week ago.I get an email asking if I could switch it to the following day or the following Saturday because they just booked a Cinco de Mayo party last night. I guess Cinco de Mayo trumps hospice volunteer week celebration. I will never patron there again."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour. They have good food and drink deals for happy hour. The queso chorizo dip was my favorite. Also got a yinzerita and it was the shit. I'll be back for happy hour again for sure."}
{"text":"I hate to give a three star review because the food was delicious, but the service was muy disappointing today. A freak 70 degree day in March, and a restaurant with garage door Windows and a patio- they should've anticipated the crowd and scheduled a few more people. My friend and I waited awkwardly at the host stand for about five minutes (2 pm) before someone hurriedly grabbed us to sit us down, table was unbussed and dirty but the man took care of it right away. High top at the bar, right by the windows so the breeze was lovely and the view was ideal. He grabbed us our drinks and told us the server would be right there. The bar area was moderately crowded, with a few j crew dressed ex frat boy tables and some retail walnut street workers lunching, but nothing that would warrant the 20 minute wait we had before our adorable little server finally came over. We ordered some chips and salsa to start as well as our entrees. We could feel her pain, clearly she was struggling with what looked like an understaffing issue. As we idly chatted and stared at or empty iced teas, 20 minutes later our food came. The appetizer was forgotten about but whatever who needs the extra carbs (we weren't charged so no harm no foul). No complaints about the food, my pulled chicken tacos were delicious and my friends fiesta salad looked fresh to death. By the time we were done eating the little server came over and cashed us out promptly. We are easy going humans so obviously will give them the benefit of the doubt but in all actuality, the place was not crowded enough to excuse the slow, slow service. I'll be back tho, love me some avocado cream sauce."}
{"text":"Love this place. Being an early morning traveler and not enjoying the typical breakfast food the airport offers, its perfect for me to grab a burrito and go. They recently got their liquor license and have frozen margaritas and beer to go! Margs are strong and the chicken is always tasty. Dominic is such a joy to talk to during stressful travel experiences."}
{"text":"Food tasted amazing. Had the two taco lunch, steak with the mango habanero sauce. Tacos were very small and the service wasn't great. 3 servers and 3 Tables filled. Yet we waited forever for our check to come and then even longer to get it back. Would definitely go back - don't get me wrong. The food was amazing."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place...  Pros:  Came at 8pm on a Saturday and was told for a table for 2 on the top floor, it would be 45 min...we only waited 10 min! Loved the atmosphere and all the staff was friendly.   Cons: The drinks were sub par. I got a margarita and it was 3 parts margarita mix and 1 part tequila After 2 sips I had to stop drinking it and ordered a Dos Equis Amber draught and it tasted funky like the lines needed to be cleaned and the carbonation was too much so I returned it and asked for a bottled beer.  Chips and guacamole app was not good...the chips tasted stale and the guacamole was too salty.   My main course was the steak tacos which weren't that bad, I actually liked them, but overall I was not impressed. I'd definitely come back if the food and drinks were better."}
{"text":"I was wanting to try out this venue after going bust on the \"Jam on Walnut\" event (going bust was my fault as I didn't realize it was a nighttime event, not a daytime one).   We saw they had rooftop seating so thought, \"Yay\"!  The setting was good (until the rain shower -- not their fault, obviously).  No prob.  We ran inside touting our tacos and drink. But, I stray.   The server was pleasant and helpful.  The drink he recommended -- bleh... I didn't know a blood orange margarita would taste like the orange crush drink -- not my idea of a good time, yeck!  Besides, it wasn't even served in a margarita glass.  WTH?   The menu looks extensive with all the choices.  But, the results?  Bleck...  I ordered \"The Amigos\". 3 small tacos - chicken, beef, and carnitas with a salsa containing cilantro which I love on my tacos.  But?  There was no cilantro flavor and worse?  The tacos were dry -- no salsa as in no liquid in the salsa topping?  WTH?   No, NO, NOOO... So many other choices abound."}
{"text":"Cool place, never been to any other branches. Nice open patio seating that's right on the sidewalk. Waiters are quick. The happy hour is bomb. That's the only reason you should be coming here. Pregame here before 7pm and get a Yinzerita. First time trying one and was not disappointed at all. Flavors were peach, strawberry, regular and some others. Got chips and queso which was decent. Both these were pretty good for an appetizer before going somewhere else to eat and for the price during happy hour. Ambience is \"mexican\", but on the basic instagram side. Didn't try any real food so can't comment, but from what I saw the it look decent nothing amazing, but good portions. Worth checking out for happy hour and the famous Yinzerita"}
{"text":"We actually came to the Southside to try Carmella's but they don't serve food on Sundays or Mondays. So we decided to head across the street to Steel Cactus.  We walked in to a warm, glowing, welcoming place. The host was nice and our server even nicer. We started out our meal with an order of chips & queso. Our wait wasn't long. The chips were hot and crispy and the queso had a little bit of spice.  For dinner I ordered 3 pulled chicken tacos on flour shells. You could get them 2 ways. I went \"Mexican\"- cilantro, onion, and grated cheese. It came with black beans and rice. My son ordered 3 pork belly tacos. They also came with black beans and rice. We both thought the beans and rice were okay.  The chicken on my tacos was moist and tender but not much flavor. You could really taste the cilantro or onion. It tasted more like parsley.   I was bummed. My son said his pork belly tacos were really good. They had a red cabbage slaw on top.  The portions were just enough for a meal but I had already eaten the queso and chips so I ended up taking home one if my tacos and most of my beans and rice.  The food was okay but we have other places that in the area that are better."}
{"text":"Oh man, I wanted to like this place so hard for multiple reasons: Mexican food is one of my top three favorite types of cuisine, they have rooftop seating (score!), it's affordable eats in Shadyside - ohmuhgawd!  We visited during the Shadyside Arts Festival, which was a bad move on our part. Everything in Shadyside was crazy packed. However, we weren't in a rush to get anywhere so that didn't bother us too much. We put our names on a the list for a table and the wait was only about 15-20 minutes. Unfortunately, they seated us at a table that had a speaker situated about 2 feet above it. As loud as they were playing their music, this was not cool. I saw a couple leaving the bar so we snagged their seats instead.  The bar area is neat and reminds me of one of my favorite bars back in Florida (Monkey Bar in Orlando!). The open air design is very nice. The bar was packed, which was not surprising as it definitely has the best seats in the house, besides the rooftop.  I've read and heard of others complaining about the service and it was no different when we visited. My boyfriend had actually come earlier in the week and said there was barely anyone there and the service still was incredibly slow. So there's that.  I decided to start off with a mojito, one of my favorite drinks. This place goes down as making probably the second worst mojito I've ever had. There was so much club soda! It's just supposed to be a splash! *sigh*  We put in orders for carne asada tacos, Pescado tacos, and the roja salsa and chips. The salsa was just straight up awful. I don't know what they do to it, but I have never had salsa that bad. I asked one of the bartenders to take it off for us because neither one of us would be eating it.  I was delighted to see that they make most of their food authentically: cilantro, queso fresca, salsa, etc. Sadly, the steak in my tacos was way overdone. It was crunchy. They should also greatly consider double wrapping their shells. While tasty, those things do not hold up at all. It's no fun eating a taco with a fork. My boyfriend said his mahi mahi tacos were super delish and they looked it. Whatever they do to the black beans is to die for and the spanish rice was really good. However, I don't think they'll be knocking off Round Corner Cantina for good, authentic Mexican food for me (and it's cheaper!).   Pros: great bar area, would be fantastic for hanging out and having drinks  Cons: slow service, so-so food"}
{"text":"This review is only for the drinks. Lived in Shadyside for years in grad school and was in town from LA for a grad school reunion/bachelorette party. Stopped in for some drinks in our old stomping ground and we were excited to try a new place with a rooftop. Well, we were having a great night until we came here. Got pitchers of regular margaritas and they were absolutely disgusting. Too tart. Between that and the hot box that the glass roof creates, people were getting overheated and sick. I had to write this bc over a week later I can still remember the taste of the margarita and it makes me sick thinking about it. This place has such potential with the idea and location, but if you are Mexican place and the margarita is not drinkable- you should be ashamed!"}
{"text":"Steel cactus is much better than the fast food chains that surround out....okay okay chik fil a is pretty damn good too. Whenever I have an early morning flight I like to come here and fill up on a breakfast burrito with eggs, bacon, beans, cheese, potatoes and pico, it's filling and tastes great."}
{"text":"Came here twice for happy hour. Service was awful both times!!!  They do have vegetarian options and tofu tacos. Second time I came with 7 ppl and they all had no issues getting additional beverages. Waitress only served me ONE beer in the 2.5 hours I sat here!! She literally stopped by the table 15 times and didn't ask me once if I needed anything. It was obvious she was ignoring me for no reason!  It took us close to 3 hours to get thru \"happy HOUR\" because service was so slow and waitress never brought checks.  She was tipped according to the poor service."}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant/bar was delicious. The drink specials were very reasonable, but I'm not sure what Pittsburgh's obsession with Miller light is. The waiter, Toby did a really great job serving the table and bringing out all the drinks and food food.  When it came time for the checks, the waiter mixed up my friend and I.  He apologized quite a bit, and I told them it's all good in the neighborhood.  I would go back, but I'm really afraid of the giant fan on the top of the building if it came loose it could chop my head off."}
{"text":"Went there be Pirate game . We friendly staff . Willing to set up for a table of 10. Didn't have to wait for the entire party to arrive before we were seated  . Excellent waitress . Tasty food and drinkswill return"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to come to enjoy Mexican cuisine and yummy cocktails. There rooftop deck is a great place to enjoy cocktail and appetizers with friends! You can't beat their happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"Three of us got three different things and three different reactions. I got the chicken taco salad with chipotle and actually liked it quite a bit. Server said the dressing was not spicy but I found it pretty spicy. This is the location right next to PNC Park and jt was pretty busy. But the staff was attentive and helpful. Prices exaggerated but overall it wasn't too expensive.  For sure there are plenty of other good choices in Pitts."}
{"text":"I stopped here after an appointment I had in Shadyside. It was a gorgeous day, and I wanted a refreshing beverage and a bite to eat. I came on a Wednesday, so select Mexican imports were on special. I ordered a Corona for $2.25. I also ordered the 3 amigos appetizer, which was three small soft tacos- one beef, one carnitas, and one chicken. They were tiny but very tasty! I also got an order of the chips and Roja salsa. Pretty good but also pretty spicy! Ive heard they have a pretty good weekend brunch with cheap mimosas and a Bloody Mary bar, so I hope to be coming back for that!"}
{"text":"Service extremely slow for time of day, (roughly 1pm). Food decent but not exceptional. Price average for the area. Generally not impressed."}
{"text":"Drinks are alright although the menu is quite boring. But I don't understand why they have the space heaters on as well as the giant ass ceiling fan. The left side of my body is nice and toasty but the rest of me is FREEZING"}
{"text":"The crowd here is definitely on the younger side. It looked to be filled with students, recent graduates, and young professionals. I think one of the main draws is the roof-top patio. It seems like a pleasant place for warm weather. In the winter, the patio is tented with space-heaters throughout preserving it as a cool place to hang out.  The guacamole and chips were okay. These days, everyone is a self-proclaimed guacamole connoisseur, so it's hard for restaurants to make guac which pleases every customer."}
{"text":"I was out with my friends in South Side the other night, and we were finishing up at Acacia and looking for another place to go. Why not Steel Cactus? After some poor experiences at the Steel Cactus in Shadyside, I thought I'd at least give this place a chance.  We got in a bit after midnight to meet some friends on the first floor--the bouncer let us know that the first floor is closed and we can only go to the second or third floors. He explained that the bathrooms were out of order and so they weren't letting anyone else on the first floor, even though there was a huge crowd and a busy bar. After some negotiating, he \"allowed\" us to stay on the first floor with the group we were going to meet.  I struggled to approach the bar and got out some cash to let the bartender know I was thirsty. I waited for about fifteen minutes before giving up. I tried again later and was able to get a weak bourbon and coke. Around 1:40, the music abruptly stopped and a staff member came around to our group to loudly tell us that they were closed and we needed to get out.  No last call? No thanks for coming? Who closes at 1:40?  I won't be back to try the food; if it's anything like the Shadyside location, I'd be similarly disappointed."}
{"text":"I went here for a school event and the drinks are terrible!  It definitely makes the list as one of the worst margaritas I've ever had.  The food was meh.  I can see the appeal of the open balcony in the summer, but I'd skip it."}
{"text":"The Steel Cactus was part of an event I was attending.  Apparently they let us down.  They were supposed to have seating and buffet set up for 200 people. As My bus was the first to arrive of 4, I can tell you, it didn't happen that way.   The seating was minimal, the buffet station wasn't going to feed 200 and the food was mediocre at best.  Coming from the south, and having lived in California, I have a fair assessment of Mex and even TexMex food.  This was neither.   The Quac was.. fair. The Chicken we were served was WAY too spicy and the taco filling was .. I can't even explain, the flavours were wrong.    That being said, at least they told us that the purple/blue chips were gluten free.  The tortillas fell apart and the salad/fajita/taco toppings were all fresh looking.  I hope that I don't have to come in again."}
{"text":"Last night, I went to the Steel Cactus with some friends for drinks. Understandably the bar was really crowded and it was taking a while to be served. When someone else was served more quickly than myself, I moved over to the area of the bar where he was. Instead of serving me, a female bartender told me, \"Moving won't get you served any faster.\" So, I decided not to get any drinks at your bar. Instead, we went to the Tiki Lounge where the bartender was cool, so I tipped her over 25%. And if your bartender would have been friendlier, I would've gladly gotten some margaritas and tipped well."}
{"text":"Stupendously unexciting Tex-Mex fare. The Yinzerita's are awesome."}
{"text":"Seriously listen to the reviews and do not come here to eat. The food is borderline inedible, of the tacos, enchiladas and nachos that we ordered not one was worth finishing.   All that said the margaritas and rooftop could make it worth drinking here and our server was friendly and attentive which is always a plus.  But do yourself a favor and  don't come here for the food."}
{"text":"Steel Cactus is a great go-to for a cold Dos Equis on a warm day! They have reasonably priced draft beers and a good variety of daily specials. A major plus for this place is the open air seating that they have by having the giant door windows along the front of the place. So on days that are just warm enough to be outside they have the ability to open them up without having to go through the fuss that other places do to have outdoor seating! I've even enjoyed those seats on a warm January day!  A major plus is the happy hour prices. All apps are half price, so you can get taquitos for $3.50, guac and chips for $3, and their chips and salsa go for $2 during Happy Hour, 5 - 7pm! They also have a variety of drink specials, for a quick snack and drink after work, this place isn't too bad!  The 3 star rating comes to the food. Unfortunately it just doesn't hold up to other local Mexican restaurants, so I have to just say it's a-ok on the Southside. Trying the tacos, I didn't love the ground meat and the chicken didn't have much flavor. They do have a variety of burritos, but unfortunately the only time I ordered one they brought me the wrong one, so it wasn't what I was hoping for / not my preferred kind. Maybe the other kinds at tastier though!"}
{"text":"This is my first and last time I would ever go to this facility. First and for most  it was me daughters 21st birthday and she made reservations, little did we know that the hostess had given our reservations to another party who lied about their reservations. After fighting for a table they give us a table with no chairs. Let's just say I will NEVER go back again and I WILL DEFINITELY TELL ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO NEVER GO THERE!! Not to mention they had ruined a special night for my daughter. The manager was literally unprofessional and simply stupid. The hostess, waitress, and staff was pathetic."}
{"text":"Brunch: the food is so so but the mimosas are only $3. That's pretty much the draw as far as I can tell. There's always space so it's good for large groups of people and they have a fun a Bloody Mary bar where you can fix your own with yummy toppings. I will continue to come for the $3 mimosas."}
{"text":"Great location next to PNC park. Food was good and the service was excellent. We had taco salad and tacos and both were fresh and tasty. Chips were freshly made and crispy. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"This place was not packed on Sunday morning for brunch. It was very low key with a good menu-- Lots of choices but not too overwhelming. They had $2 mimosas which were very generous. The huevos rancheros were yummy and my fianc√© got some delicious apple cinnamon pancakes. I would definitely recommend this for someone who wants to switch up the normal breakfast on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Very nice location. Beautiful views from the balcony overlooking Walnuts St. We were only here for about 30 minutes celebrating my brothers birthday. It was after 12am so the restaurant part was no longer serving food. We only had a few beers and ten left but I was definitely enjoying the vibe of the place.   This spot makes for a good first date or just a friendly get together with co-workers and friends."}
{"text":"Service was prompt, but the food was not the best. We got the nachos with queso which was probably the best part of the meal. The enchiladas were more like taquitos and the tofu tacos were really bland. We asked for cheese on the tacos but it didn't happen. Heard this was a good place for brunch, but I wouldn't go again for lunch"}
{"text":"Great place to eat on a game day!   We decided to eat here prior to the Pirates game, and it didn't disappoint. They had excellent tacos and quesadillas. Also, our table ordered guacamole, queso and salsa. They were all very flavorful and started off our meal with a bang! Yum!!  We also had margaritas, and the price was $18 for a pitcher which had approximately three glasses each. Or you can buy one individually for around $7. So if you have enough people, I recommend the pitcher. The strawberry margaritas are AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Just came back from lunch at this place and holy shit, I think I'd rather be a member of the Donner party than ever experience that again. First of all, it's about five degrees warmer than outside and that might be generous. Our waiter told us there was a draft and that they had purchased space heaters, but they weren't up and running due to some reason I can't remember. They don't serve warm drinks - you would think if they're going to force you to sit where it's 40 degrees, they would spring for some Swiss Miss.   My friend ordered the Mahi tacos and I ordered queso with chorizo. I don't even know why we stayed at this point, but we endured the elements of inside the restaurant as we prepared ourselves for a mediocre meal. We waited almost an hour to get these two things - at that point, I was contemplating that Jack London story where the guy freezes to death and thinking that would be a better way to go than starving. The waiter apologized as he brought our food as they had a large catering order that day (this dude was nothing but kind and polite by the way - the one star actually goes to him).   So I dip into the queso and it's lukewarm, nearer to cold than not - perhaps it froze on the way to our table. I actually asked if he could heat it up - he said he would just get me a new one. This took another 25 minutes and to be fair, the waiter was nice enough to take it off the bill without any prompting. The hilarious part is that the new one he brought didn't have the chorizo. I didn't complain again - partly because I felt bad for the poor guy and partly because I only have like 40 years left on this planet and complaining about average faux-mexican food already seemed like a waste of time once.  In conclusion, if I was to recommend this place, it would be in July when you have a couple days of vacation.  EDIT: I really appreciate that they responded. I want to reiterate that the people there were all extremely nice and it's not their fault the heating was down. I just wanted them to get that fixed ASAP and I know this kind of thing helps. I would honestly give them another shot as my friend enjoyed her mahi tacos. I just don't want to freeze while doing so. It was my friend's birthday lunch while we stepped away from the office for a bit so it was disappointing that it was so cold. Thank you guys for responding and I look forward to trying it again in the future when things are sorted out with the heating."}
{"text":"Bruce ! Bruce was our waiter and he kicked ass! We loved him. He was on time with everything and very personable! I suggest everyone requests Bruce!"}
{"text":"Mary took care of us. Great waiter.  Menu is very inviting.  The wait time after we ordered was over 45 minutes for a party of five while there was only 3 more tables around us.  The food was TERRIBLE,  cold, no taste, you name it.  None of us finished our meal"}
{"text":"I had a few hours to kill on the North Shore before getting a ride to the airport and had a hankering for Mexican. Melissa, the bartender, was great, and the Camerones de Chili Lima (shrimp tacos) were awesome!!! Great stop on game day (or the next day in my case). Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Steel Cactus is not a Mexican restaurant because it doesn't serve real food. Their food tastes like plastic. Even their chips are gross-- how do you mess up tortilla chips?! I do like the open-air space and cute decor, and have been for drinks a few times. The drinks have always been made well and are tasty, but are seriously overpriced compared to other bars in the area. Every time I have come, I have had to deal with staff with attitudes. Most recently, I had not one, but TWO unpleasant incidents. On a Saturday night around 9:00 PM as things started to get busy, I was ordering from a female bartender who was moving around while listening and ended up next to her coworker, causing me to talk across him (he was taking orders from other customers). The male bartender (shorter guy with piercings, I believe) very rudely snapped at me and was like SHUT UP AND WAIT YOUR TURN, I'M HELPING SOMEONE ELSE. I was appalled that he would talk to a customer like this to begin with, much less one that wasn't even talking to him. I informed him that I was talking to his coworker and that was that. About an hour later, things started to get too wild for my group, so we went to close out our tabs. When I got my bill, I almost toppled out of my bar stool. There were charges for things I did not order and the drinks that I ordered that were on special did not have the discount applied. The girl said her manager decided to cut off the special, but since I had been there for hours and was not aware, they would honor it. I was willing to wait for the manager to come take care of the extra items and drink prices, but luckily the bartender was able to take care of it on her own. So she said/so I thought. Thank goodness I saved my receipt, because when I checked my credit card charges two days later, there was a separate charge for the amount that she \"took off\" my bill. Rather than remove the items from the check, in an effort to get me to leave and free up the bar stool quicker, she split them off onto a separate check and ran my card twice, only giving me the one receipt for the correct amount. I did call and speak with the manager, who was very understanding and refunded me the unauthorized charges immediately. I am glad the situation was remedied, but I am shocked by the dishonesty and disrespect exhibited by the bar staff at Steel Cactus. Steel Cactus isn't overall awful, but it will never be my pick when it is my turn to pick where to eat/drink."}
{"text":"Been to the one in Shadyside a few times and always had a good experience. The one in the south side still doesn't have it together. Service was awful. Took 20+ minutes to get our first round of drinks. Our server took our order after we were sitting there for 30 minutes. Our food came out, but we didn't have silverware. Server came over 10 minutes later and finally addressed the issue. By the time we had everything we needed to eat, the food was cold. It wasn't even a packed house, so the excuse that they were really busy isn't applicable. The manager still tries to use the excuse 'we just opened and are still working on things'. It's a restaurant chain that's been open for weeks now. They should have things rolling smoothly by now if they new what they were doing. Won't be going back and would not recommend."}
{"text":"I've been back quite a few times for happy hour and I do have to say that I am liking Steel Cactus more and more for that.  I did order soup yesterday and it took almost 5 minutes to get a spoon for it because apparently the waiter didn't actually have access to the soup spoons and had to get one from the kitchen.  It's ok though because it wasn't particularly good (cold or warm) anyway.  Another thing I would like to see is some consistency.  The PIC and I order pretty much the same things when we go there, but each time the dishes are different.  Do the nachos come with black beans or was that a mistake this time?  How do I get a little cup of chopped up jalepenos once and the next time I get whole ones?  Why do I get a different salsa each time?  It's all very confusing.  There is one thing that will make me give this place an extra star - get some darned refried beans on that menu!"}
{"text":"the ceviche is HUGE!!!  One of the best happy hours around!!!"}
{"text":"My organization hosted an event at Steel Cactus last night. Michelle is the event manager, and she was awesome! The staff was incredibly accommodating and friendly. My friends and I had dinner there before, and the food was also excellent. That sweet corn and roasted tomato salsa is DELICIOUS! Also, I do not like spicy food and the waitress was able to pick out something for me that I would enjoy. We had a wonderful time, and would definitely recommend this place to anyone hosting an event. Incredible service, friendly staff, and good food and drinks! Way to go, Steel Cactus! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was a great atmosphere for my fianc√© and I to have a couple of drinks before finally calling it a night. I just love their ambience. Great colors, lighting, and furniture. It's tastefully decorated and has a very relaxing atmosphere. Great music playing in the background. Steady stream of people but it didn't feel overly crowded. We were here during the week, so I imagine it must get quite packed on the weekends by the young college crowd in the area.   Drinks were okay. I felt like my margarita could've been a little stronger, but it was fine. Our server was great both times. The second time I wish they would have closed the windows. After awhile if your sitting too close to the outdoors, you wish you had a warmer jacket even for a summer night.   We ordered a dessert on one of our visits. It was okay, but I can't say it was all that impressive. Just okay. Much better than any Chevy's out West where I live. But I think they wouldn't be first on my list if I wanted truly authentic Mexican food experience. It's mostly about the nice atmosphere, fun music, and people you're hanging out with that make this a memorable experience."}
{"text":"This was a \"had to do\" for the vegan familia as anywhere we see a veggie protein option we will try.   I like the spot for sure, it would be great for beers in the summer with the windows open. Cute and comfy and great for people watching.   The host was great, funny etc.... we had a laugh. He also turned the heaters on for us because in the winter it's a bit chilly up there.   Waitress was fine, didn't know the menu at all, and certainly had no idea what a vegan was....which is fine because she asked the kitchen .  I'm on prep so I had water because they had no hot tea. Jeff had a couple beers - on draft, nothing too much to offer but some Mexican beers.   I had a taco salad with added tofu less the guac and cheese and dressing - lol...in the taco bowl. It was fine but for my purposes these days I could've eaten 2.   It was taco Tuesday so Jeff had 4 hard shell tacos with \"vegan beef\". It is not vegan beef, it is beans and rice blended into putty with onions.   It was pretty greasy, not ultra healthy even if you try but we are the extreme so you can definitely find something to eat there. Not a vegan hot spot, but worthy in a pinch if you're starving, or if you eat cheese the nachos looked ok...how do you kill nachos though?   Oh! they did have vegan cheese...and I think it was the kind that melts so you could opt for that too."}
{"text":"We actually enjoyed steel cactus quite a bit.  We got the De Muerte burrito and the enchiladas. The burrito was pretty good. It was a little dry and felt like it was mostly tortilla so it was good we ordered extra sauce on the side with the enchiladas just so the burrito was a little less dry, however, it was still a pretty good burrito.   The enchiladas were pretty good too. You get three and get to pick verde or red sauce. Comes with a side of beans and rice. I really enjoyed those.  One thing I noticed was nothing was really spicy so if you're looking for a Mexican restaurant with lots of spicy food this might not be the place for you.   I still give this place 4 stars because the service was attentive and friendly, the food was filling and not too expensive, and if you go during happy hour, appetizers are half off."}
{"text":"Love the staff and the food, always a good time at Steel Cactus. the deck in the summer is a great place for groups to meet up."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I were walking around the area before the Bucs game yesterday afternoon, and he got hungry and thought Mexican sounded good. We were right out around the corner, so we stopped in to eat. We're not local, and this place is good enough to be attached to the park, so we figured it was good enough for us. Well, first of all, the hostess looked at us like she was confused about us being there. Not in a mean way or anything, she just genuinely looked confused. Like, squinty eyes, \"why are you here?\" look. Then our waitress seemed like she did not want to be there at all. I understand not wanting to be at work, and I know we all have bad days, but it just wasn't a great customer experience to be served by someone wearing a coat and day-old makeup. We sat down and she immediately asked us for our food order before we even got to look at the menu, but when we did order, the food came out in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered the chorizo tacos and my fianc√© got a chicken burrito. My food was super greasy, but I know chorizo is very greasy, so I gave it a slight pass. I did have to drain my tacos before I ate them, but they were tasty. My fianc√© said his food was not warm at all. He said it tasted okay, but it was hard to get past the fact that it was cold. At one point, I said it felt like we were in the twilight zone because of the weird vibe everything gave off. Everything was served promptly, and drinks were refilled quickly, so it wasn't a terrible experience. It was just a weird one."}
{"text":"Before a night at Mario's in Southside, we decided to get together with a group of friends to grab some Mexican fare. With another location in Shadyside, the Southside outpost of Steel Cactus opened up less than a year ago.  Paloma [$8] Sauza Blue Silver 100% Agave tequila, grapefruit soda   I started off with one of my favorites - the paloma. Unfortunately, either the grapefruit soda was on its last leg of effervescence or it was simply grapefruit juice. That made for one sad drink. I didn't have the heart to send it back because the size of our party kept increasing so we had to move tables three times (completely our fault!).   Mexican Mule [$9] Hornitos reposado tequila, ginger beer, muddled limes   The GF's tipple was better, with a nice Mexican take on the omnipresent mule. This was subtly sweet, with a bit of herbaceousness and spicy kick from the ginger. Nice.   Dip Trio [$11] Pineapple salsa, queso dip, traditional guacamole  We started with the dip trio, which featured a choice of salsa (we went with pineapple), guacamole, and queso. The salsa was light, sweet, tomato forward, and had a hint of spice from the jalapeno. The queso was luscious with the essence of Dos Equis Amber added in. The traditional guacamole was light, with the addition of cucumber.  Pulled Chicken Tacos [$10.99] Spanish rice, beans  The GF went with the pulled chicken tacos, which were moist and came with your choice of flour or corn tortillas. She went gringo style, which means it was topped with lettuce, tomato, and shredded cheese. Mexican style is the other option, which features cilantro, onion, and grated cheese. The accompanying Spanish rice had some kick. The black beans were tender and came with melted cheese on top.  Pork Belly Tacos [$12.75] Tequila BBQ, spicy red cabbage slaw, radish sticks   My pork belly tacos weren't up to snuff unfortunately. I enjoyed the tequila glaze which cut through some of the heft of the pork, but the belly was tough and only slightly thicker than thin-sliced bacon. The spicy red cabbage slaw was nice though.  Our server was lovely, but our order was messed up multiple times. It's possible it was a kitchen error and not the server. Overall, I've had better Mexican, though admittedly I'm not sure what level of Mexican fare is actually available in the Steel City."}
{"text":"Tastes like Eat N Park sold alcohol.  Went for brunch. Service was laughably slow. The Huevos Rancheros was frozen potatoes with scrambled egg and canned blacck beans. The saut√©ed peppers and onions were no where to be seen.  Sheetz has more flavorful guacamole.  If you're there for brunch ask for the pitcher of mimosas, it's more for less money, not that our server told us. We saw someone order it.  I will not be back if I can help it."}
{"text":"Second bad experience here. This time guacamole had zero taste to it and we tried fixing it with bar lines and salt...nope. Gave up when a friend bit into the avocado stem and nearly cracked his tooth. Two times is enough. Service is pretty terrible too."}
{"text":"how do you mess up Guacamole?    Apparently Steel Cactus can by making it with Avocado's that don't seem particularly ripe, mixing in some of the weird green fake avocado paste, and refrigerating it (it came out in it's bowl with water on the bottom).  Wack.  Also, we were told that shrimp taco's were good after being told the interesting sounding beet tacos weren't.   Shrimp taco's sucked - kinda sweet and not particularly noteworthy.    The upstairs open air terrace is kinda cool, but this place sucks."}
{"text":"Steel Cactus was a really fun place when I went months ago! It was very crowded probably due to it being a Saturday night, but my group and I were able to find a corner to have all to ourselves and had a blast! I ordered some different fun and fruity drinks and they were good and priced low-moderate. The first floor is really dark and flooded with people at the bar and eating. The second floor has some tables, some booths on the side and standing room by the bar and at the corners of the building. I would definitely come back here on a drinking night, or even to try their food in the afternoon some time! Definitely check this place out for the atmosphere, drinks and location!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places I can give or take. In my opinion it is kind of like a knock off Mad Mex. While I am all for trying some knock offs, I would prefer to stick with the real deal here.  First off, we were seated up stairs (it was February, 40 degrees out, and very windy). Of course they have the whole area covered in plastic, which is terrible when it's windy out. Sounded like we were on a rocket ship about to blast off. It would have been a plus that we had a heater right beside our table, if the heater actually put off any kind of heat.   The fresh chips are pretty good. We decided just to go for the Roja salsa, which contains roma tomatoes, onions, and jalapenos. It had a good taste to it and had just the right amount kick to it that I like.   I for whatever reason decided to get the Shredded Chicken Enchiladas. It comes with 3 rolled enchiladas topped, and I chose to have it covered in verde sauce. There is also some kind of cheese covering them. Honestly, if it wasn't for the sauce, the enchiladas would have been completely bland.Not much I can say for the rice. It was bland as well. The beans tasted like beans, nothing special.  All in all, I might come back just to see how the tacos taste. But It really isn't somewhere that I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Would give this place zero stars if that was an option. My experience. We ordered a couple of their high-end margaritas. When the bartender finished making them together in the same shaker and came up short on one glass what did he do? Make another one then top it off? No he simply topped off the short margarita with triple sec....nice....  two of the same drink, looking completely different, and one tasting terrible.  Did not stick around for more.  Another Shadyside loser."}
{"text":"Excellent facilty right off Walnut St. Convenient parking on corner in parking garage  and lot behind building. Super taco salads, burritos, and tacos. Outstanding sauces. Balcony view overlooking historic Walnut St.  A Winner !!!   Mgr Justin takes care of all his customers. Thanks Justin. :-)"}
{"text":"My son got 2 tacos for $6 whatever, cool. Well, I got the \"specialty taco\" which was steak and a mixture of coleslaw and stuff for $14.... ok whatever they're probably good. Um, they were the SAME LITTLE TACOS that my son got for his kids meal. Omg I just paid $14 for an upgraded version of a kids meal they offer. I'm not kidding...these things were like baby mini tacos.   Oh, and the \"queso with chips\" tasted like  velvetta cheese, microwaved, on high for 2 minutes with a topping of tomatoes ...burnt my tongue. Spent $50. Next time I'll just go to Taco Bell for my Taco Tuesday fix."}
{"text":"I will be straight forward, I am not a Steel Cactus fan. I only return because friends always drag me here. I always order the Dos Equis Amber queso dip, that I absolutely love. I will also usually have a Yinzerita. Beyond that, I'm not convinced. This particular visit, I felt as if my table was an annoyance for the server. I did not have iced water until after my appetizer was served. I had to ask a different server for menu's because mine was not response or anywhere to be found. I always give this place second chances and leave feeling truly disappointed. Great environment but mediocre, at best, entrees."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of the type of food they serve so I cannot comment on that.   They have very good drink specials so I generally just go for drinks. I like the patio upstairs so go when the weather is nice so you can enjoy that.   Generally we've had decent service at Steel Cactus.   I would not go out of my way to go to Steel Cactus; but, if you are in Shadyside and looking for a place to grab a beer I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Not good. There are far better quick-service spots. My food was beef tacos (soft) with little flavor and I wasn't able to finish them because they were so bad. Go somewhere else if you want to be happier."}
{"text":"It was a very lively atmosphere, but got a little loud and we found it hard to carry on a conversation even when we were sitting right next to each other.  Our waiter was very nice, and attentive, and our food and drinks came quickly.  The margaritas were a little sweet for my taste, and we were disappointed that we couldn't get a frozen margarita in any flavor except mango...not even a classic lime.  The salsa and queso was delicious, and the chicken tacos were good, but my food was lukewarm when it got to the table.  Overall, I'd go back for an early evening happy hour, or try out the lunch menu."}
{"text":"The Steel Cactus' food is only slightly better than what I can make at home - in that it was hot, fresh, and a very reasonably priced lunch that I didn't have to cook. The balcony overlooks Walnut Street, which was nice during the Arts Festival, but not a big enough draw to make me want to go back."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try Steel Cactus for a while now, but honestly have not been missing much. We came for their happy hour on Friday. All appetizers were 1/2 off! I had the pulled chicken nachos and my friends had the quesadilla carnitas nachos. The food came out really quickly.   The nachos were HUGE. The chips were loaded with queso, lettuce, tomato, onion, jalepenos, beans and chicken. My issue was the chicken had absolutely no flavor. I would have preferred to have just gotten plain nachos. My friend who had the carnitas nachos also said her carnitas had no taste. Overall, very mediocre mexican food. Definitely would not come here if not for happy hour."}
{"text":"They greeted us as we walked in and asked if we wanted indoor or outdoor seating, but I was a little worried when we sat down and got the chips with guacamole. The chips literally tasted like cardboard. The guacamole was very very cold and didn't have much flavor, didn't taste or see any cilantro or garlic. Just a little bit of diced tomatoes and onions, so nothing special there.   Then the food came. I had the grilled tofu tacos with avocado and spicy cabbage on top. Honestly, my favorite tofu tacos ever. The flour tortillas were tasty and the rice and beans were good. The waitress was very nice and the food was exactly as we ordered it.  The drinks were reasonably priced, $4.50 for a corona.   The atmosphere was average sound-wise at 6:30 on a Saturday and there was a family with a baby there as well as what looked like several large groups of friends there when we went. So it would be suitable for anyone. I would go back."}
{"text":"This was the first time that I've been to the Southside location, and was pleasantly surprised by the food, atmosphere, and service! My server Cassandra was incredible attentive to our group. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food is good and the yinzeritas are quite the experience - a little too fruity for my taste but others seemed to enjoy it.  You have to try it once.    Very vegan and vegetarian friendly and the service is great.  If you don't eat meat I would recommend checking your food though as my girlfriend ordered the tofu tacos.  Three of them come in an order and one of them had chicken!  Thankfully she noticed before she had any and notified the server.  The server and manager came over and apologized profusely and gave us a free entree!  I believe the service makes up for the error and won't keep us from coming back.  I recommend sitting on the rooftop bar as it's quite nice and romantic."}
{"text":"First entering the restaurant you get a pretty cool vibe of the atmosphere with dark colors, bright lights, interesting tables and designs and music at a loud but good volume. We went on a Friday night, and it seems to be a popular choice, so for the weekend seems like a good place to hang out not necessary a sit down dinner. Service was quick in asking what we would like to drink. On a side note, it is interesting for a Mexican Cantina to have a low selection of Mexican beers, and being hispanic and new here from California it is sad when the waitresses has trouble pronouncing them, not to say she wasn't nice, our waitress was very friendly.   For the meals, the menu was a bit limited, pretty much tacos and burritos were the option to eat with a couple different selections. Missing an assortment of authentic meals that come to mind.  We ended up ordering a Mango and Shrimp civiche appetizer which tasted a bit different from normal civiche but it was definitely a flavorful experience. After looking over the menu, we ended up going for the shrimp and Carne Asada meal and what I believe called the chicken burrito de muerte (named for its \"spiceyness\"). The food was from ok to pretty good. The Carne Asada plate has very good sauce poured on top of the shrimp and steak and it overall was cooked great and tasted wonderful, For some reason they grilled onions and left a big pile on one side of the plate, kind of confusing, didn't seem to go with the carne asada or the mexican rice with the plate, maybe a better idea if they chose to put a side of beans instead.  The burrito was stuffed with rice and cheese, and could have used a lot more shredded chicken but it has a good taste. Came with chipotle sauce and sour cream. And for being a burrito de muerte, I sensed no spice at all, this opinion seconded by my pregnant wife. Though the chipotle was delightful.   Of the three options for dessert, we went with the deef fried banana cheesecake with vanilla ice cream. The appearance was nice and totally through us off, we thought we were served chimichangas. Ended up the dessert was great! Very sweet and flavorful, went great with the ice cream.   Overall with a great atmosphere and shopping near by, I would suggest coming for sit down dinner or lunch during the week. I cant say about going out for a beer or to hang out, but by the appearance of the crowd and the vibe of everyone, seems like a good choice. If you want AUTHENTIC, this is not the place to go. BUT it is good food and good prices. Appetizer, dinner for two, dessert, and drinks came out to a little more then $50."}
{"text":"Tried the dinner menu once and wasn't impressed. However, lil known tidbit- one of the Only places in Shadyside you can order off a brunch menu at 10 am on a Saturday. The pulled chicken tacos Mexican style are on point.  The P.C. option not so much."}
{"text":"During the Legendary Haunt Tour back in November 2016, this was our dinner place for the evening. The group was about 200 people and this place was suppose to have enough room for us all. I thought maybe our tour organizer purchased the whole restaurant because it looked small outside.   Nope. The restaurant was open to everyone and our section was upstairs in a few small rooms. First off, we are haunters with our spooky look going on. Other customers were staying at us because we looked like Halloween in November in the city. Second, the set was a huge failure. Not enough food, not enough room for 200 people, and the food was horrible.   To be honest, I thought Taco Bell tasted better than what was served to us here that night. The taco fillings like chicken and beef was too spicy, greasy, and not well seasoned. It had some season that was extremely strong. The enchiladas were too mushy that they were hard to pick up without falling apart. While in line for the buffet set up for us, I had to wait a while for more food. Not very selective in the food choices offered to us either.   Then we were given 2 drink tickets for the bar. I tried to order a cocktail, but was denied because it was only good for beer. However, other people were able to get cocktails with their drink tickets. I was upset. I just got 1 beer and gave my other ticket away. Then seating was a huge issue. It's very difficult to eat tacos, enchiladas, and nacho dip standing up holding a glass of beer and plate. All seats were taken in the small place. Then since people were waiting for seats, people felt rushed to finish their meal so they can offer their seat to someone else. I wanted to enjoy my meal and have conversations with other people. That is what is suppose to happened during the tour.   Overall, I completely disliked this restaurant. Not because of the tour experience, but because the food was horrible and the staff wasn't that nice either. Some staff members had an attitude towards us. No bueno."}
{"text":"The food here is really disappointing. Their chicken soup was tasteless, as was the guacamole. I had to put hot sauce and salt in both just to get some taste.i don't know how they killed the taste of avocado. Amazingly for a Mexican restaurant, the tortilla chips were the worst part of the meal. They had no salt on them at all and tasted like they'd been fried in really old oil. I'd never eat here again."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and don't go here.  It is one of the worst meals I have had in a long time.  The food is low quality and poor tasting.  I love Mexican food, love it and I could take only a few bites.  My husband felt the same way about his meal.  Unlike other reviews, we found the staff friendly and once it was apparent we weren't eating the manager came to see if there was anything she could do, offered another meal from the menu.  She tried but we just wanted to get out of there.  Plenty of restaurants on Carson Street, don't pick this one."}
{"text":"Rooftop is so wonderful! Service is good, bartender is great.  I really loved the rooftop so I will definitely be back for but not so sure about the food.  The poblano relleno was terrible, the cheese quesadilla was good."}
{"text":"Meh, it's kinda hit or miss. Really depends on the people you are there with, and depends on the fact that there's not going to be drunks trying to fight with someone over little things.  Food is ok (the regular tex-mex stuff). Their yinzerita is something that everyone raves about - i've never had it though. The huge fan at the top is some kind of a marvel I'll agree. It's nice in the spring/summer because it's nice and cool in the top floor (granted it gets ridiculously crowded however)  It's just something else to do on walnut"}
{"text":"Due to accessibility I've been back twice to Steel Cactus and my consensus is just meh for meals but great for drinks and chips. The first time we sat at the bar. Ordered chips and queso and a beer, which was thumbs up. I like how their chips are seasoned. I ordered the chicken tacos but the food lacked flavor. The chimichanga dessert though was the bomb! The second time we ordered chips and guacamole traditional, which was (standard) delicious. I wasn't that hungry so I ordered the salmon and pineapple ceviche and I was not a fan at all. The ceviche was a big bowl of mush by the time I received and the flavors did not meld well together. Also we tried to order Dos Equis on draft but there was something wrong with the tap that made it taste like a completely different beer. And while the waitress didn't charge us for that draft beer she handed us a bottle of Dos Equis and charged us for that, as oppose to asking if we wanted another type of beer. What a bummer as had high hopes for Steel Cactus."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday evening.  No line and we were seated immediately.  Then waited 15 minutes for a server to come.  It was busy but not crazy busy.  I was ready to walk out but we really wanted tacos.  The bar was open so we relocated.  The bartender was working alone and was hustling but he took care of our orders.  The queso con chorizo was very good.  Nice flavor and consistency.  Could have used a little more chorizo.  Chips were good.  Substantial enough that they didn't crumble.  I order the brisket tacos.  They came as per the menu.  Good flavor but there was not just enough filling in them.  I liked the food but not enough to put up with terrible service.  i won't be going back.  There are other tacos in town now."}
{"text":"One word--Yinzerita! A beer garnished margarita it does not get any better than that! I've only been to the Shadyside location, but am hoping to check out their E. Carson St. store here soon.  Now some Pittsburghers swear by Mad Mex as THE Mexican place in the town, but I prefer Steel Cactus, especially their \"build-your-own\" feature. I particularly enjoy the chorizo burrito with verde sauce--simple, fresh, straightforward, and satisfying"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch with my family and everyone enjoyed the place. Food was really decent, tasted fresh and authentic not like the typical Americanized Mexican food. was not impressed with the bloody Mary bar one bit, highly recommend avoiding it. The Huevos Rancheros and there chipotle salsa were great. Service was great and the place was very comfortable and pleasant."}
{"text":"if you need a fast meal and 5 beers for your 30min lunch break this is the place on the southside"}
{"text":"We came here after participating in a clinic at PNC Park and in before a game between the Pirates and Cardinals.  Our server was friendly and helpful with questions we had about the menu.  The food was really good.  My son and I split three tacos your way.  My son is a picky eater so the fact that he ate says alot."}
{"text":"Food and drinks mediocre, service terrible. Once I asked the bar tender if they had cider, he said no, my friend points to the drafts and there was one on tap. I went with a group of friends and we sat in a round booth, the server was more interested in showing us her cleavage instead of good service. The cocktails here are too sweet. Their signature margarita is made from a mix, not from scratch, and it costs something like 12 bucks. Go to Mad Mex."}
{"text":"Tonight, I went to Steel Cactus in Shadyside. Lauren the bartender captivated my heart. She loves my group of friends, very nice, and I'm glad to have had her as my bartender. Food was on point and great!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican cuisine, fun atmosphere. The desert chimichangas are amazing. Gets a little loud in the late afternoon/early night because of all the college kids. Yuenzeritas are also a local favorite."}
{"text":"Steel Cactus is a chain that just happens to have an outpost here in the airport. I have never been to any of their regular locations so this was a new experience for me.  As one of my passport stops on my recent Yelp event this was one of the last places my husband and I stumbled upon. We were fairly full but decided we could squeeze in just one taco and chips.  The taco was a dark meat chicken taco and the chips were just okay. Again, this is your typical airport fare but it at least gave me the impression what this Mexican restaurant was serving. Since it is designed for traveling, you order at the counter then pick up your food at the other end.  Their other locations are in Shadyside and Southside. Located on the left side in the center of the food court in the airside terminal, food court seating is located behind the row of fast eateries or you can take your bagged food directly to your gate for your flight."}
{"text":"I came here for taco Tuesday and off the bat our waiter had a very apathetic attitude. I ordered 3 tacos which were $2.50 each on Tuesdays. They DO NOT tell you that sauce is extra PER TACO! I was charged $.25 for some mediocre salsa per taco. The tacos were okay, nothing special. The only saving grace was the mango margarita."}
{"text":"20 minute wait, at 25minutes we were told 'another 10 minutes', now at an hour and the clock's still ticking, just watched 2 tables get mis-ordered food and one of the wait staff clearing food onto the floor. Not only that, we watched the hostess set the menus on the floor, wipe them with a rag, then pick them up and put them in the menu stand. That was the last straw. Wait staff is taking their time delivering checks and cleaning/turning tables. Some training is necessary here.  We've been nothing but pleasant and cheerful, just wanted to be able to review the actual food!  We're outta here."}
{"text":"This place is so disorganized and filthy. People who work there look drunk and like they are going to throw up. I ordered a water and nachos. The water took 20 minutes, I asked for a refill and it never came in the hour I sat and waited. My nachos were given to a different table and took an hour for me to get. I recommend to go anywhere else. Waste of time and surprised they are still serving by the stadium."}
{"text":"Who and what is running this place? Here is the list of things that need changed. Tables and bar are dirty.  The booths had dirty finger prints and food on the seats. The tables have holes (knots) in the wood that have dried up food in them. Music was not balanced , too low and they were playing absolute crap.  The lighting was like the inside of a refrigerator.  Beaming down on the tables and bar.  Server training the other server knew too little to train anyone.  Servers looked unkept, long hair all over the place. Short shorts, raggedy clothing. Server had to go back to the bar three times to find out what vodka they carried.  Delivers a drink with no garnish.  First guacamole was super spicy and they were kind enough to exchange. They second one needed salt and flavor.  Mid meal the waitress asked if we wanted our check.  What, no chance of getting a second drink...maybe suggest a dessert?? Who does that ?  Wait staff congregates at the corner of the bar so much you would think they would have better knowledge of what is behind it.  Hostess was pleasant and accommodating. Why this is still in business I have no idea!"}
{"text":"Below average rating due to my most recent visit which happened to be Cinco de Mayo. My husband and I visited and sat at the bar -we arrived minutes after noon. I asked for a mimosa pitcher and the bartender (who was less than thrilled to wait on us) told me they weren't doing brunch items anymore. I thought that was odd since the sign on the chalkboard at the entrance said brunch was until 2p but okay. We ordered different drinks (alcoholic) and I guess since we didn't ask for water we didn't get any -no big deal. We asked for a menu and the bartender told us we could only order appetizers at the bar and if we wanted a meal we had to sit somewhere else. We said okay no prob and ended up ordering nachos with plans to leave and go elsewhere after. Nachos came out and were great though the bartender couldn't be bothered to give us plates so I ate mine over a napkin bc her presence was fleeting -specifically fleeting to the other end of the bar to socialize. I should note that a couple sitting right by us being waited on by a different bartender(male) got appetizer plates to eat their nachos with and waters upon sitting down.  He actually ended up bringing us our check after asking us if we wanted another round of drinks -wish we'd have had him the entire time. We probably would've stayed.  Totally unimpressed with the experience of the most recent visit. There are a ton of good Mexican places in Pittsburgh, I don't need to go to one with crappy service."}
{"text":"Been here a few times,  every time it was a negative experience.   Food wasn't great  I had 20 dollars in songs on the juke box skipped over.   Bought drinks only to have a bouncer tell us it was closing time literally 2 minutes after we were handed the drinks and that we had to leave, In this case my friend sternly dressed him down and the guy left us alone.  This is 3 separate trips,  3 negative experiences.   Don't waste your time, goto one of the other perfectly fine bars on walnut street"}
{"text":"Steel Cactus- a great Latin-inspired local eatery that has everything from bowls to tacos to whatever else you could want! I had a chicken taco with the freshest cabbage I have had in my entire life! Phenomenal."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Mexican food, so I'm always on the lookout for restaurants like the Steel Cactus. Granted, I consider Steel Cactus a little lower on the quality scale than most other Mexican restaurants, but they have a great happy hour which my roommates and I frequent.   One of the things I really like about the Steel Cactus is the rooftop bar. This is such a fun place to be in the summertime, enjoying a fruity drink and looking out over Shadyside. As I mentioned, my roommates and I usually come for the happy hour, so I can't speak too much to the regular entrees. Concerning the happy hour - it's one of the best we've found in the burgh. They have a whole list of house wines (about six of them, I believe) that are $3 a glass...and they are pretty healthy pours! Additionally, all of the specialty cocktails are only $5. I appreciate this a lot as I enjoy getting cocktails but most happy hours only put one or two cocktails on special. I usually get the mojito; it's pretty good, and there aren't many other restaurants in the city that offer mojitos year-round.  On the food scene, all of the appetizers are half off which turns out to be a great deal when you come with a few friends. For example, the guacamole is usually $8, down to $4 at happy hour, and thus only a little over $1 per person if you come with two other friends. You can't beat that! My roommates and I LOVE dips, so we always go straight for the guacamole and the queso dip. The quesadillas with chicken are good as well. One of my friends is gluten-free, and she was easily accommodated by switching out the flour tortilla for a corn tortilla on the quesadillas.   Is this the best Mexican food I've ever had? Well, no, not by a long shot. But man, you can't beat the prices! If you're looking for delicious authentic Mexican food, the truth is that you probably want to look elsewhere. But the Steel Cactus is always a great choice if you're looking for a super cheap happy hour where you can share a few tasty drinks and apps!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place a three star rating is for the atmosphere and the happy hour specials! The rooftop is so fun to hang out with family and friends, and during the week their happy hour is awesome! It's $3 glasses of wine and $5 specialty cocktails, which is an awesome deal. I've had the food, and it was absolutely average. Nothing to rave about, because it was kind of bland. However, I'll definitely go back for the good atmosphere and the drinks!!"}
{"text":"I live close to this place and have gone a few times. The food is okay, nothing special or authentic. The atmosphere is fun with good open air space in nice weather. However, my biggest beef is with the strength of the drinks. I ordered $10 pitcher of margaritas and they were pretty much juice. It might be a better idea to just order beers here because if you're looking for some Mad Mex strength margaritas you aren't getting them here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place out last week, and were pleasantly surprised. I was a little thrown off by the reviews, but it seems like the place is new, so with any new restaurant there are kinks to work out. The spicy Guacamole was really good, and they killed it when it came to the tortilla soup. I was also a big fan of the shrimp tacos, the taquitos, and the dips...I'm a sucker for a good queso! The space is great, I love the metal lamps downstairs and the rooftop patio is great. Sadly we don't live in the area but this will no doubt be our go-to whenever we're in town."}
{"text":"Go for the Yinzerita, but only at happy hour. They're good, but not $11 good. Service is pretty good, but the food is pretty mediocre. I usually go here to drink and eat chips and dip, not to actually eat a meal. I'm not super sold on their other drinks- I've ordered a mojito there twice and it was really watery both times. The rooftop is really nice, though, and it's awesome during happy hour in the warmer months!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Not bad at all!  I think you kinda expect a restaurant like this to be more of a hangout place than anything else.  I mean, they offer margarita's with beer bottles stuck out the side of them!  How do you take that seriously?!  I can tell you how.  By the quality of their roja (roma) tomato salsa, which I could not get enough of.  Or their (Camarones) shrimp taco's, which I ate every bite of.  Or their black beans, which I never usually touch, that I ate half of (big feat I know!).  Although delicious, my pineapple cocktail probably could have been non-alcoholic with the amount of liquor included.  I might order a marg next time, or perhaps just a brew.  Or both, apparently!  Sure, maybe it looks a bit like they've replicated a Mad Mex, but it's a Burgh staple, how can you not?  Add in the huge rooftop balcony, toted s the highest in Shadyside, and I'm a happy little burrito.  I believe that means I'm wrapped in a warm embrace of delicious Mexican food and I'm happy!"}
{"text":"The serving sizes are laughable - two tiny tins of rice and beans to accompany 3 sad, small \"specialty\" tacos. I laughed when I saw the plate. Salad was mostly lettuce. Also- service was super slow. No free chips! Not to mention they tried to take away my dad's food AS he was eating it. Avoid!"}
{"text":"Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh (including Steel Cactus) have no business charging people for chips and salsa; it's the only place I've ever been where that happens and it's riddamndiculous (*steps off Soapbox*).  I don't hate Steel Cactus.  I would totally go here for happy hour or dinner, mostly because I am a Mexican food fanatic and could eat it pretty much every day (it's a convenient location for me, and sometimes one just needs a taco immediately).  If it weren't convenient, it's unlikely I'd go seeking this place out.    The best parts: the rooftop patio, and happy hour drink specials.  Kudos for that, Steel Cactus.    The least-good parts: the food is, in general, bland and unexciting.  While the price point isn't bad ($10-13 for most entrees), they could use a happy hour food special or two.  My personal preference is for more authentic, cheaper Mexican food, like Emiliano's on the South Side."}
{"text":"I was there Saturday night around ten. There was not too many ppl . Drinks were strong . Bartender was friendly and professional. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to come to Shayside for some drinks for a while decided why not Steel Cactus. Mind you this was about 1:00PM but still I was vising some friends and we wanted to check it out. We get lead to the up stairs bar where the three of us hung out. Total must have been 6 other people on the upstairs patio not including the bartender. Drinks where moderately cheap but my scotch whiskey was very flat. My friend also got some food and wasn't impressed by it either, just meh. Place is ok but I bet their are better places to go."}
{"text":"Lovely. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It was open and busy but not loud so you could have a conversation without shouting. Service very quick and friendly. Great Fajita Burrito! Drinks came quick and the house margaritas were pretty good also for only 5 bux! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely atrocious. One of the waitresses blatantly insulted a friend of mine during our dinner; behaving wildly inappropriate and showing no remorse for her actions. Love the drinks and tacos, but that very catty, unnecessarily mean behavior left a gross taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Typical over-crowded bar with weak drinks and crappy food. Bartenders and servers rarely make eye-contact. However, this place is perfect for that \"IDGAF\" college-crowd or 20-something bachelorette party that yell \"WOOOO\" really loud whenever they get wasted."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place even one star is because I did have a good time there once before. The bartenders are nice, drinks are fairly cheap, and the DJ is pretty good. However, I took 4 stars away because of the unbelievably slimey and sleazy security.   Strike 1: Me and 3 of my other friends all decided to spend a casual, non-crazy night out at Steel Cactus, because as I've mentioned before, we had a good night there before. We walked in, the music was pretty good so we started dancing. For a particular song, 2 of us went to the bathroom while the other 2 went to dance on the dance floor. When we met up with these 2, my friend told me that one of the security guys ran a finger down her back.   Strike 2: My friend and I were dancing while the other two went to get drinks. While the 2 of us were dancing alone, we noticed that 3 security guards started grouping around behind us and stared at us like we were pieces of meat. This was an easy fix once we all regrouped and they focused their attention on whatever else.  Strike 3: One extremely drunk young woman (I'm talking drunk out of her mind, leaning against the wall, eyes barely open) was being grinded on by a SECURITY GUARD. He obviously knew she was intoxicated beyond  all reason, because while he was grinding on her he was LAUGHING. But wait...it gets worse.  The security guards circled around her while she struggled to dance in the middle and then fell face forward. You would think security would help then...NOPE. They stood there and laughed at her (as did other douchey bargoers, but that's besides the point). Some nice lady and gentleman tried to gently shake her awake (which by the way was the only time someone helped her) when finally ,security, you know, the ones laughing at her, realized \"oh damn, maybe we should help her\"picked her up and escorted her out.  Needless to say, I am incredibly disappointed in Steel Cactus and the lack of security there is there. I am still stunned that I witnessed something so vile and disgusting. My blood is still boiling, and I've had a few days to mull this over. Steel Cactus, I seriously hope your management reads this and reevaluates who you hire. This is a total disgrace and will not be returning here any time soon."}
{"text":"I took my daughter here after visiting the Andy Warhol Museum on a Sunday afternoon. There was no Pirates game in town so it was quiet. We were first seated inside, but the music was too loud, so we moved outside. Our server was very friendly and helpful! My Bloody Mary was good but my meal was a little spicy for my taste. Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for the Yelp Elite event and their tacos were delicious!!! Definitely one of the best tacos I've eaten (and my friend agrees)! Meat was juicy and the one taco filled us up to the brim (and I like to think that we can handle a decent amount of food). Thank you to Steel Cactus for providing this food and thank you to Yelp for giving us this opportunity!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now for the late-night scene, but had held off on coming in for the food because I had heard it wasn't that great and I wanted to give them a chance to work out their kinks. I came in for lunch this past Friday, and had the same sentiment as the people I had talked to. I feel like my experience at most Mexican restaurants can be predicted by my experience with the guacamole, and this held true at Steel Cactus. The gauc was neither good nor bad - while the avocado seemed fresh, the flavor wasn't great, and the guac itself was pretty bland. I had the soup of the day - Lobster Bisque - as that is one of my favorite soups. There was quite a bit of lobster in it, but the flavor was lacking. I also had the chance to try the Chicken Soup, which had a bit of a kick, but I still wasn't particularly impressed. The Veggie Burrito was decent, although again, nothing that left me wanting me.   All of that being said, I would still come back because the venue is so incredible. They have done a great job renovating the place. The rooftop is amazing and they have now winter-proofed it to a degree so they can keep it open as the weather changes. The bar is also very unique and decorated nicely. Although I was a bit disappointed in the beer selection, they have a full bar."}
{"text":"Hipper than Chipotle, but more of a straight shooter than Mad Mex.  Cool tin ceilings, massive tables with inlaid steel cactii and simple but well prepared tex mex make this a worthy alternative to other Shadyside Mexican options.  My only complaint is, the food can take a while to be prepared, but it's a price I'm happy to pay to get everything made fresh and hot.  Steel Cactus is particularly good during early and late night happy hours where you can get great drink specials, $2 tacos and $5 for GINORMOUS juicy burritos.  Steel Cactus, welcome to the neighborhood, we're glad to have you!"}
{"text":"The Steel Cactus is def. A-OK in my book.  The biggest selling point is the deck - I would go as far to say this is one of the best decks in the 'burgh.  It's HUGE, with ample seating, AND offers a glass-covered ceiling so you can enjoy the outdoors without worrying about the elements.  In our fair city, that's key since it does rain here every once in awhile ;)  Daily drink specials are offered, as well as Happy Hour and Late-Night deals.  This makes Steel Cactus ideal for a slightly-younger crowd than myself.  No hate there, just an observation.  The peeps enjoying the deck last night were most certainly in the mid-20s age bracket.  I enjoyed the Carna Asada Enchiladas, per @Kristian M.'s suggestion.  I'm usually hesitant to order steak in any of my Mexican food, at the risk of it not being a good cut and then ruining the whole entr√©e.  Not the case at the Steel Cactus; the steak was tender, juicy, and had a great flavor.  SC is a fun place to enjoy tasty adult beverages on special and above-average Mexican treats in a youthful, energetic atmosphere on one of Pittsburgh's Premier Porches."}
{"text":"I go out in Shadyside almost every weekend.  While sitting in one of the booths last night, I was with about 10 other people.  The server mixed up our checks and I was charged for a shot and a beer more than I actually ordered.   When last call came around and we got our checks, I told her of the errant charges.  Which was fine.  She was trying to sort it out.  Two bouncers then came toward us, one a bald, black gentleman, and one a blonde tall white gentleman.  They yelled at us to \"Get OUT, Bar is Closed!\"  I told them, I am waiting for a corrected check.  The server messed up my check.  The blonde guy yelled back, directly at me, while I am in front of my friends, \"I DON\"T CARE, GET OUT!\"  He did not stop staring at me for the next minute or two.  I asked him if he didn't want me to pay my check.  Again, he yelled \"I DON'T CARE.  GET OUT!\"  This was intensely unprofessional.  And i will NOT return to this establishment.  There are plenty of other places in Shadyside where I can spend my money.    I was with friends.  And I was embarrassed.  And I do not know what petty anger this bouncer felt he needed to discharge upon me while I was waiting for my corrected check.  Never again."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my 21st birthday with my family! Had a \"yinzerita\" which I would definitely recommend, very yummy. We went on a Saturday night so my only complaint was the noise and the service was a little slow. They gave us free chips and salsa since it did take awhile, and our food was good. Excited to go back for their yummy sounding brunch"}
{"text":"Head to Steel Cactus for an authentic Shadyside crowd and somewhat original Tex Mex fare. The 3 Tacos Built Your Way was ideal for sampling a few of their meat preparations. The steak + carnitas were spot on and the chorizo, while equally tasty, was borderline crunchy. Rice + beans? Not memorable. The redeeming quality was the rooftop patio with the Big Ass Fan -- the open air space and Pens playoff fever allowed for primo people watching."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh visiting.  This is one of those noisy restaurants just wanting to be a bar.  Question:  What is it about the inability these days to have a conversation over music at dinner?"}
{"text":"To be honest the bad reviews almost turned me away. However, we had a great time. The service was better than the food but just slightly and we enjoyed our meal immensely.   We were greeted with smiles. Our little one expressed a desire to sit upstairs and a table was immediately cleared for us. When we balked at the stairs we were shown to the elevator. Our server was gracious and friendly and made great recommendations. When we lamented just missing the brunch and the 2$ mimosas she gave us free mimosa coupons! Food and drinks came out fast. Portions were genorous."}
{"text":"A co-worker chose Steel Cactus for her going away party. I made a (somewhat late) party reservation via email with the events manager, Michele. She was very helpful and accommodating, and squeezed us in on the rooftop even though there were already parties booked. There is no reservation fee for parties, but Michele did mention that there is a spending minimum for larger parties (our reservation was for 20 people).  I loved the rooftop seating. It's open air with a clear glass/plastic roof, so that you have a view but don't have to worry if the weather turns bad.   Our server was attentive and accommodated a couple of special requests with our order. I don't like Mexican food, so I didn't eat much. But I have to say that that the queso was delicious, and my colleagues enjoyed their food. The drinks are overpriced (to be expected) but I thought they were good and rather strong.   Overall, I would recommend this place and I hope to return for the rooftop seating before summer is over!"}
{"text":"Service is AWFUL. We didn't even get the chance to eat. We got there and after being told we could sit on the bar the bartender told us we couldn't sit there, when other costumers were sitting there. We decided to give it another try and sit on a high top to enjoy dinner. After a long wait the waitresses came and VERY rudely told us that the high top was reserved, when the whole place was empty and it didn't have a reserved sign. After that horrible service we decided to leave. There are so many better restaurant/bars to eat on that street with much better service. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"We liked the waitress and we bit on her yinzerita suggestion.  We ate too much. The yellow and black burrito should be named the black and gold. Wife and I are trashed and just realized we are the oldest people on the bar. Oh well."}
{"text":"I graduated from Pitt a few years ago and came back to my old stumping grounds in Shadyside. Anyway, this place was new so I figure I would give it a try.  First, the drinks barely have any alcohol. My mango margarita tasted like juice, with a little drop of tequila. Second, the food isn't that good. Ordered a chicken quesadilla that had to be sent back because the chicken was undercooked.  Service is good though.   This place would be cool in the sumer."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch yesterday. There were very few tables when we arrived yet it still took a while to be greeted by our waiter. We ordered the queso con chorizo appetizer which I've gotten before and loved. It was actually the reason that I selected Steel Cactus for lunch--I was craving the queso. The appetizer came out and the cheese was bright yellow--looked like velveeta and tasted awful. When the waiter came over I asked if the recipe had changed. He stated that the recipe had not changed but was sometimes inconsistent?? Not sure exactly what that meant.  I told him we didn't want the queso because it just wasn't good. He apologized and took it back to the kitchen. Within 5 minutes he brought back a new bowl of the queso which was white in color and tasted the way it was supposed to. I'm still so confused as to what and why we were served the first mess. Then as I was about to take a drink from my iced tea, my boyfriend asked what was in the glass. It was a piece of sticky paper stuck to the inside of my glass--which I had drank out of several times already. Gross.  I've been to Steel Cactus about 6 times prior to yesterday and always had a good experience. In fact, yesterday was my birthday and this is where I opted to dine. Needless to say, it was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere was amazing. The food is pretty mediocre. Its a great spot for drinks."}
{"text":"I got the three amigos appetizer which consists of a carnitas, beef and chicken tacos. It's literally the WORST tacos I have ever had - the chicken was bland, the beef tasted funny and the carnitas was barely acceptable. I also got this in a soft corn tortilla, and they only wrap the fillings with one so the tacos break apart super easily. I basically forced myself to eat one taco and then couldn't do it anymore because it tasted so bad. DON'T GET THEIR FOOD. Their drinks are decent and are probably the only things I will order from there."}
{"text":"Horrible experience pls don't go this place it will make you sick not fresh food at all the rice taste bad, hard and re heat  I don't have even words to describe how bad it was"}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow (we waited quite a bit for our checks and then to get our checks back), but the waiters and hostess were very nice. They checked in multiple times with our group of 7 to see if we needed anything.   The fajita burrito was delicious and the portion was definitely worth the price! I'd definitely come back to try other options on the menu."}
{"text":"We were heading to the Apple Store and went over the the Steel Cactus for lunch.  We thought the frozen raspberry margarita was very good.  I had 3 tacos with rice and beans.  The only thing a I thought could have been better was the rice.  Everything else was pretty tasty!  We would definitely go back in the future.  I had the chorizo, pulled chicken and carnitas tacos yum..."}
{"text":"Service was minimum, the server rarely checked back on our drinks or meals. Our margaritas for happy hour were excellent and the food was pretty good. We ordered a chicken quesadilla and Mexican street corn. Unfortunately the corn was overcooked and quite mushy but the quesadilla was pretty good - could've used more cheese though. I would give this place a second chance if the opportunity arose."}
