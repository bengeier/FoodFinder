{"text":"Me and my GF were down at the outdoor show on Plum Street last week. Decided to try E-Town Pizza since it's right down from the venue. We got the steak pizza and it was incredible! Loaded with perfectly cooked steak and lots of cheese and grilled onions. We also tried the fried cauliflower and it was awesome. The employees were so friendly too. We'll definitely be back to E-Town Pizza!"}
{"text":"There needs to be a 0 stars option. This place is actual trash and so is its employees.  Pay money just to have my orders messed up. Do not waste your time. Go elsewhere! Staff has a attitude even though they are the root problem. Garbage establishment. Take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've ordered a few things from their menu so far.  Their specialty pizza's are awesome.  I've had their gyro and buffalo chicken; both of which, were great.  Their pizza dough is great, maybe store bought but it doesn't matter.  Once their was too much flour on it, but that was it.   I didn't like their Italian sub though, just seemed like lower quality meats on it and american cheese."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but has really gone down hill.  Delivery takes almost an hour, food arrives cold, and toppings are skimpy and not fresh.  I truly would NOT recommend!"}
{"text":"1 and done, will NOT be ordering again! We're new to the neighborhood so I decided to try it out. Ordered a large pizza with bacon, small steak salad, and a kids mac n cheese meal. First the pizza, crust left much to be desired and was cold upon delivery. The small steak salad was very small for $6. I've paid the same for a nicer salad at other places, the \"steak-um\" steak on the salad wasn't even cut up, looks like it may have been microwaved, not grilled. The mac n cheese wasn't even mixed and again, cold upon delivery."}
{"text":"I wont order from here again. Not tasty, not prepared right. Ccoks always on the street smoking (i smoke out of view) just a dirty lil hole in the wall joint. If ya gunna be a hole be a glorius hole in the wall with bangin food not all crap thats may or may not be frozen and or canned when fresh is probably cheaper and a better product. This place needs to step up its game."}
