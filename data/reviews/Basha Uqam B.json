{"text":"We popped in here for a quick lunch. The place is kind of run down and sketch but that is a lot of Montreal restaurants so if the price is right... which I have to say the price is right, the kebabs are good and the sides were great. The eggplant side dish (saksuka is what I know it as) was phenomenal. I know this is a small Montreal based chain but it was still pretty authentic and yummy. I would much rather go here than another rival chain (Amir) that I avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I ate here three times while I was in Montreal, and most of the days I didn't eat there, I was wishing I had! Truly, for the price, the food is hard to beat. The platters are around $10 and the sandwiches even less.   Among other things, their red-cabbage and green salads stand out -- crispy and healthy with flavorful Middle Eastern seasonings. The \"tout garni\" falafel wrap comes with creamy garlic sauce, briny pickled turnips, grilled vegetables and tahini. The shwarma platter might be my favorite -- fresh salads alongside buttery rice pilaf and tender-crispy shards of beef from the giant rotating shawarma behind the counter. Great, now I'm getting hungry just remembering it.  The staff there is wonderful: friendly, helpful and willing to speak French to a novice. Major points in my book. I wish the atmosphere inside was a little nicer, but on a beautiful summer day I would rather head for the park anyhow!"}
