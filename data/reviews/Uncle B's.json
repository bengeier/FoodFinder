{"text":"I love this place!!  Great chips and salsa. Love the white chili con queso!  Ask for pico de gallo in it :-). Great food and really great margaritas!  and.... best Fried IceCream = ask for chocolate and honey together on it."}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting authentic Mexican, because this is not it.  However, if you love Tex Mex that is a big step up from Taco Bell, this is the place to be.  The staff have always been very nice and helpful, and they have never once screwed up my order here, which is something I can't say about many places.  I always get my enchiladas minus the onions, and have never found an onion in my food here!  The margaritas are pretty rad if you're into that kind of thing, and I do love the fried ice cream, though I'm usually way too stuffed from scraping my plate clean to order it.  For non-authentic Mexican, their refried beans are also damn tasty."}
{"text":"I found this place about 10 years ago when I worked for a different agency and we went to arrest a guy in the motel next door.  The restaurant staff were fantastic in helping out nab the perp, but I never returned.  Years later I figured I'd give it a shot.  I went on a Wednesday night when the parking lot was packed and there were plenty of decent cars in the lot indicative hopefully of a decent crowd.  The place still is colorful, with charm and plenty of knick-nacks on the wall that make it interesting for kids.  They started us with good chips, but warning to some, they're peppered in a light cayenne seasoning.  Very good, and the salsa for the chips was good too.  The children ordered off the gringo menu, but my stars, their food looked fantastic...of course you can't go wrong with fresh cut fries.  Mrs. \"You're Kidding Me, Right?\" Y, and myself had fajitas.  My order at first was messed up, but the kitchen did a make-good and they offered to re-cook the botched order.  Regardless of my choice in meal, the fajitas were really fresh, and packed with flavorful options.  Best part of this trip was the strong drinks, ordered some margaritas and Tequila Pancho didn't disappoint, they were strong...pretty much the opposite of our Marcelitas adventure in dining."}
{"text":"The food is great.  The staff is great.  Try the burritos.   Story time: (the events described here in no way reflect on the establishment, this guy is just a jerk)  My first time there.  A rather drunk individual, who had already been thrown out earlier that day, came in for take out.  He was staying in the adjacent hotel.  The bar tender said just sit there and wait for your food (she was way to nice to deal with this jerk).  The guy then started looking around.  Then got up started asking other customers (in a drunken uncomfortable way) if he could use their cell phone.  After about 3 or 4 customers, I heard the line that I never thought I would ever hear.  \"If you don't stop asking the customers to call the police, I am going to have to ask you to leave.\"  Well they came, and he was taken out.  But excellent salsa and chips!"}
