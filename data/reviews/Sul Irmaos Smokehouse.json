{"text":"OMG.  This place is amazing. Fast friendly service. Reasonable prices. Enormous portions. \"YOU HAVE GOT TO EAT HERE\". This was my first visit and won't be my last."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this gem. Discovered it after a recomendation from a friend and greatful they recomended it! Some of the best smoked food I have had in the GTA!"}
{"text":"I have been eyeing this place for a long time. I love anything smoked so seeing the word smokehouse was enough to draw me in. But it wasn't until I read all the great Yelp reviews that I finally ventured in. The smell was so amazing I wanted to stay there all day. I was very lucky that I came on a Friday because the special of the day was the Portuguese chicken which typically requires call ahead ordering of 2.5 hours lead time. The chicken breast was amazing! I got mild- and it still had a bit of a burn to it. I loved it so much. The fries were really good too! I felt that the portions could have been a little larger but for the price I can understand the smaller portion size. 

My husband got the smoked salmon sandwich and he did not enjoy it, but in all fairness, he was expecting smoked salmon and not a smoked piece of salmon steak. Lesson learned. The pops were single serve small glass bottles, it would have been better to have regular, refillable fountain drinks, but I'd still go back! I shared a Portuguese custard tart with hubby and I loved that too! 

We sat inside but they have a nice outdoor seating section as well. My advice for most restaurants: please invest in more comfortable seating. 

I already messaged my foodie friends about this place to encourage them to try it out! I will be recommending it to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Nice place, fun concept, great service, poor execution. 

Sul Irmaos is one of those restaurants that equates more with good. More grease, more mayo, more bread, more random toppings that don't add anything to the sandwich. There's no balance of flavour or texture in anything we ordered. 

Ate there last night and the place is still wreaking havoc on my digestive system and the boyfriend's. 

We ordered the ATBs. 7 bucks for 5 unappealing looking bacon wrapped jalapeños with cream cheese. Super-super greasy. Didn't find it enjoyable at all. Don't get me wrong - Bacon and I are best friends. Got a dozen bacon roses for valentine's day bc that's how much I love bacon. But it was so greasy it wasn't enjoyable. Like had-to-sap-the-grease-out-on-my-napkin-before-eating it greasy. The highlight of our meal was the ATB sauce. It is really delicious. Sweet and peppery. 

I ordered the smoked salmon po' boy. The protein to bread ratio was off - there was barely any salmon in the 10 inch monster roll! The bread is pretty good. Soft and fluffy - strangely reminded me of Subway's though and would have tasted better if it was slightly toasted. Anyway, the lack of salmon was replaced with excessive alioli and pickles.  The texture was mushy because of the soft, small amount of salmon, and excessive sauce. Couldn't finish it. 

I think maybe it could have been improved if it was topped with a crunchy slaw and a thicker cut of salmon instead.

Really wanted to like this place! The brother at the counter was incredibly helpful and his beard game is totally on point. And it was on You Gotta Eat Here! Damn you, John Catucci! You led me to heartburn hell."}
{"text":"I would have to say this is one of the best places to eat in Downtown Brampton. They are still new (just opened September 2012), but the guys running it are great. The food is good, but I'm sure it will become great. I can't wait for them to get their liquor license because a good sandwich always needs a good beer to wash it down.

{"text":"My friends and I have been wanting to check this place for quite some time. And Sul Irmaos Smokehouse is the place to be. The wait time for the food was a little long but it was worth it, food was delicious and fulfilling, I was having a hard time finishing my pulled pork & beanasaurus due to its size. I am planning on returning  to try other items on the menu and hopefully it will be as amazing too."}
{"text":"Went here on a rainy Saturday (surprisingly it was empty). Favourites were the homemade fries (must), the pulled pork beanasaurus, and the turkey and waffles!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after reading great reviews! I had the beanosaurus sandwich - it did not disappoint!! Crispy Mac n cheese fritters, baked beans, and tender bbq pulled pork packed in a big foot long sandwich. Truly a gem in Brampton! Must try!"}
{"text":"Loved it. My brother has been raving about this place for a year.  So when we finally checked it out,  I had to ask myself.... 'why on earth did we wait so long?' first off the service was awesome.  One of the brother took his time orienting us with the restaurant's Louisiana meets Acores concept. And since I love the cuisine of both locales,  I knew I'd be in for a treat.  I was not disappointed.  My hubs got the Turkey po' boy. The belgian waffle was a strange addition in my opinion,  but he loved it and couldn't stop raving about how delicious it all was together. I went for the smoked salmon. So good! I couldn't finish it all,  but it kept perfectly well I  the fridge and reheated nicely for the next day's lunch. We also tried the fries. The house rub is very tasty! Sort of like bbq potato chips. For my own tastes I would reduce a bit of the sweetness,  just a tad tho. Love the location near city hall and Gage Park.  Love the decor. Was very excited  to hear they have live music biweekly. We will definitely be back... Mostly likely with friends in tow.  Muito bom irmaos!"}
{"text":"Amazing food . Very friend staff and a must go if your in Brampton. Not sure why they close early at 8.30 on weekdays"}
{"text":"I dropped by here with 3 other friends. My friends all got the beanasaurus sandwich while I got the beefeater. All the ingredients blending together very well, and I actually had the opportunity to try both sandwiches. The beanasaurus wasn't as \"smokey\" as the beefeater, although still having that southern bbq taste. They were completely different, but both equally appetizing. I've been reading some other comments in regards to the meat serving (which was perhaps not as generous as You Gotta Eat Here pegged it out to be). Next time I eat here I'll definitely order a double serving of meat. Other than the food, the wait staff was very professional and joyful. We sat on the patio which was quietly tucked away from the nearby downtown hussle and bussle."}
{"text":"Food Was great, however the next time I went the place was closed because of a flood and I haven't had a chance to go back since.  Would defiantly recommend this place, based on my first experience."}
{"text":"If yelp could give a 6 star rating,  this place would get it.  Couple of buddies and my self split the butter chicken the beanasauraus and the beef eater .  Food was great.  Delicious,  variety,  different tastes altogether. 

Had the full chicken,  and it was juicy.  

Plus the atbs were a great app!  Comes with 5 pieces

Will definitely come again and try other sandwiches.  

Plus server was really nice and accommodating. 

:)"}
{"text":"Went today for a pulled pork bifana and it was amazing as always. Service was great and food was hot and fresh. Best Portuguese food in the GTA 100% and the prices are so fair it's unbelievable!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, nothing but delicious... My mouth is drooling as I'm writing this review because I remember the first time my friend brought me here after we walked downtown in search of a place that had good food! 

Upon entry, you see a very small, quaint restaurant filled with bubbly personalities. The owner is no exception. 

Upon being seated, we were brought our menu and we're told as first timers to try the wings with the rub. We ordered the wings, Mac and cheese bites, the beefeater (think that's what it was called), the butter chicken po boy, and a bunch of other things that I can't even remember. 

Though the food did take a considerable amount of time to arrive to the table, the wait was well worth it. If you are ever in Brampton and want a good place with good food, you gotta eat here! That's right! This restaurant was featured on You Gotta Eat Here! And you really do, try it try it try it! Take it from me, I really enjoyed myself, and I know you will too!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on \"You Gotta Eat Here\" on the food network so I had to try it. Went on a Saturday for lunch, small little place but I like that. I ordered a veal sandwich and the ATB appetizers. The sandwich was very good very moist and very filling. the ATB were good, not great could've been a bit crispier a tad soggy and not enough filling in the jalapeños. My only negative thing was the service, the girl who served us was great however, there was only one girl working so it took almost 10 mins jus to get a menu then another 10 to get our beers and place our order. It was a great meal and cozy little place in a great area of downtown Brampton just be ready to wait a while for the whole experience if it's busy."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of downtown Brampton is Portugese inspired Sul Irmaos Smokehouse. They are known for their sandwiches, and boast a co-sign on \"You Gotta Eat Here\" with Canadian John Catucci. 

I expected an epic sandwich, but was slightly disappointed. Service was average. It took a while for menus and waters to arrive once we sat down, and our table was still dirty. The waitress was polite and eventually came to wipe off our table, but I found the place to be under-staffed for a Saturday evening. 

I was stuck between their pulled pork Beanasauras and the Beefeater. I opted for the latter, as I read a negative review about them using frozen mac and cheese bites.

The Beefeater: brisket, deep fried okra shrimp crunches, collard greens, house gravy, caesar dressing and creole mustard (10.95) was meh.

The brisket was thin as cold cuts, and not the main component of the sandwich. The sandwich seemed to be filled with mostly the deep fried okra shrimp crunches which were just OK.

I enjoyed the bread used for the sandwich, however I just did not find the proportions to be right. I would have preferred much more brisket, and thicker cuts too, for it to be an epic sandwich. 

To make matters worse, they charge $1 for hot sauce... NO thanks. I am not sure if it was homemade or not, but all I really wanted was tobasco, or sriiracha. 

I will likely not return in the future."}
{"text":"Did not live up to the hype.  Sandwiches are ok but nothing special.  Flatbread pizza too cheesy. Service is really slow and sloppy."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a whim, and had the turkey and waffles po'boy and it was really awesome. Great flavour combination, really well executed. The service was friendly and helpful, and the place was very busy. Highly recommended for great, unique food and friendly service for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"I know, I know, I've been on a super positive 5 star kick lately, but that's not because the holiday season has got me all warm and fuzzy... heck no (well it does) but I've been crossing off some serious lines on my CM bucket list and trying the best places I have wanted to visit for a long time!

Sul Irmaos, has been near the top of that list for a long time, and after a recent camping trip with some buddies from the Brampton area, where ALL I heard about was how amazing this African/Portuguese sandwich spot on George street was... I knew I had to get there.

If you're not form Brampton (even if you are) this can be a tricky spot to find, but to help you out, you'll wanna take Hwy 10 aka Hurontario aka Main street all the way into the Brampton Downtown core. Once you pass the main intersection of the city (queen and Main) you'll want to take a left on Queen and then another quick left onto George St - beware this area is under heavy road construction so you might even be better off coming from  Wellington (off main) and then onto George.

This spot was featured on Your Gotta Eat Here, got having unbelievable fusion style PoBoy sandwiches. And unbelievable they are!!! I went with the Pulled Pork Beanasaurus - Southern style pulled pork, kettle cooked sirloin chili, creamy slaw AND deep fried MacNcheese bites. 

The server informed me when I asked if it came with a side, that I wouldn't need one, so I took her at her word - boy am I glad I did.

This sandwich is many things... healthy is not one of them. But when you order something with Pulled pork AND Deep fried MacNCheese bites - healthy isn't exactly on your agenda. You're hunting flavour!

And Holy shit balls - I was in flavour country up to my eyeballs. I'm pretty sure I heard angels singing Ave Maria every time I took a bite and a single tear rolled down my cheek when the magnificence of this BEAST hit me.

Years from now paleontologists will struggle to find the remains of the Pulled Pork Beanasaurus as most people who have ordered it, finish it to the last bite. Annihilating it from existence without a trace.

Eatcrest Out! Roar!"}
{"text":"Best Po Boys sandwich I've ever had!

It's in the downtown Brampton area, so parking is always a bit of a challenge on streets like this one, but it's totally worth it.

It's great for lunch but I've never been for dinner.  Whether you dine in or get your order to go, it's a short wait and the food is simply amazing.

I highly recommend the Pulled Pork Beanasaurus (I think I have the name right) but you really can't go wrong where.

Portions are great, prices are good too.  You should definitely try this place out if you're a BBQ fan!"}
{"text":"A gem in downtown Brampton if you ask me. After 2 attempts at getting through the door (holiday & some other type of closure) I finally made it. It took a few minutes to get seated just because I couldn't determine if I was to seat myself or not and it was fairly busy. It was a nice day so I sat on the patio. 

I opted for the Pulled Pork & Beanasaurus with a side of Potato Skins.

The sandwich was AMAZING! Mac and cheese... Pork... Beans... Coleslaw... THE BREAD. The flavours come together like no sandwich I've ever tasted and its HUGE. I could only eat half while sitting there before tapping out.

The potato skins fell short for me. Wasn't what I had expected at all. They had some type of sweet sugary topping and I felt they should have been more on the salty side. Potato skins to me equal sour cream, bacon and cheese... Maybe if they had optional toppings like a Cajun spice or something it would've been better for me."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my lunch here. The two of us got a beef brisket sandwich as well as the pulled pork/mac and cheese/bean sandwich. Both were very good... AND MASSIVE. The waitress wasn't kidding when she said we could have just gotten the latter to share. It was probably like 12-14\"? Definitely a very filling meal so come hungry or come with a friend prepared to share.

I loved the mac and cheese bites in the pulled pork sandwich, and I would get those as a standalone side next time. I like that the menu has some originality to it (like a turkey and waffle sandwich!), makes me want to go back. We were mildly disappointed that even though we ordered the brisket sandwich to be \"hot\" (choices being mild, medium, or hot) it was not hot at all.

My other minor complaint is that when it is cold, you experience an unpleasant cold draft every time the door opens, and that's the case wherever you sit because of the open layout. It would be nice to have a curtain around the door to block off the cold. Even so, I was surprised that the restaurant only had one other table of guests when I was there around 12:30 on a weekday. This place deserves some more love!"}
{"text":"So delicious. I had the beefeater and a I shared a side of Mac n cheese bites with my boyfriend. So impressed definitely will come again."}
{"text":"I've only been a few times, but this place packs a punch! They're home to one of the best appetizers I've ever had: ATBs. I dint know what it stands for. All the Bacon? Awesome Tasty Bacon? I suspect bacon is involved somehow, because they're jalapenos stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon. A must-try! 

The sandwiches are amazing, too, of course. If you're not familiar with po' boys, there's a lot happening in one sandwich. If you hate mixing food together you may not like them as much as I do. My favourite is the Beanasaurus which is an epic mix of barbecue, cole slaw, beans, etc. A barbecue plate on two pieces of delicious bread.

Give Sul Irmaos a try.  I can't imagine you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm sooo full *lol*. You definitely get your monies worth when you come here!

I shared the beefeater po' boy and the hot honey BBQ wings with my friend and we were stuffed with deliciousness!

The beef brisket in the sandwich was so tender and juicy...you get the pop of sweetness from the shrimp.  I thought this would be an overwhelming sandwich with all the toppings but they work well together...oh, there's beef brisket, collard greens, okra and shrimp...hopefully I didn't miss out too many things in there lol.  Now the jumbo wings...those are just bomb! I love that they still keep the tip part on the wing, people underestimate that little part of the wing.  I think my fingers still smell smokey after washing my hands a few times lol.

This place was featured on the show, You Gotta Eat Here and I see why.  

Great friendly service and the brothers always have a smile on their faces to greet you.  If you haven't tried this spot yet, you should!"}
{"text":"Great, unique place to have here in Brampton. Sul Irmaos means the \"Southern Brothers\" in Portuguese. How it translates to food is: southern-style Po' boy sandwiches, with their own take on things - whether it be their Portuguese background or just uniquely their own ideas.

I've had virtually all their Po' boys. First thing I like is that they have the best bread for any comparable place in Brampton. They likely get it from a legit bakery and not simply some Dempster's style bread. It's always been fresh and is the proper bun for it. The portion is huge too, and you really won't need to order anything else. 

Each Po' boy is their own take and not simply a standard you may have had before. This is generally a strength; however a couple of the sandwiches could use the 'less is more' approach. For example, the 'turkey and waffles' doesn't need the calamari. Some may feel differently, which is only natural with food; however, they risk alienating a wider customer base. I enjoy 'the beefeater' though I know the reception was mixed for a couple people I know. All that said, there isn't much I'd change with most of the sandwiches, and they do have a couple 'traditional' ones with fewer toppings.

Sides can be hit and miss. The potato skins aren't my thing, and if you order fries (I mean 'if' since the sandwich is huge) I would say without the spice rub. ATB's (bacon-wrapped jalapeño stuffed with cheese) are really good, and the mac and cheese is solid.

Quite a few non-alcoholic drink options, and they have draught beer from Mill st.

Nicely decorated, open-concept and has a patio. Service has always been friendly and timely.

And it wouldn't be a Portuguese place in Brampton without take-out chicken. Good value, and they do have a unique edge by having it smoked.

Come and give them a try. Be adventurous, but also consider which flavours will meet your taste when ordering."}
{"text":"From what I've had here, I'm going to say this place is pretty allllright. The owner, and staff are very nice (when its not busy, and you have time to chat.) I've only ever had take out, though.

The only downside really for me is the sandwiches lack crunch! Maybe a crunchier bread, or something? Because there is so much sauce and stuff going on between the buns that it ends up being soggy. 

My favourite sandwich is the turkey waffle, I love the sweetness. My kids love the pressed ones! And my bf loves them all!

Huge portions, and everything I've had is pretty tasty, can't really complain."}
{"text":"The food here is bland and the staff is poorly organized.
 I've sampled the brisket, the \"Beefeater\" and the pulled pork and they all suffer from the same basic problem: You can hardly tell they've been 'smoked\" at all. If they had been in a smoker, it was only for an hour or two, before they were finished in a regular oven.
 On the two occasions I visited, the service was less than stellar. I had the impression they hired friends and/or family, rather than professionals.
 One final note: This place has more fake reviews than almost any joint I have visited. I'm so glad to see that Yelp has figured this out and moved the \"One review, five stars\" entries into the \"not recommended\" list. Talk about insecure!"}
{"text":"This place is worth the hype! It was featured on The Food Network and you have the option eating in or ordering take out. We choose to dine in and our server was attentative and extremely professional.  They have plenty of drinks there to go with your massive sandwich.  I was surprised they had everything from Beer, Whiskey, and Cocktails.  I stuck with a water because I was already hungover from the Holidays.

I ordered the Beefeater sandwich and it was delicious! The sandwich was massive and you could easily eat it with 2 people.  The bun was super soft and all of the meat tasted so good!  I was surprised that a place like this existed in Brampton but I will definitely be coming back for more!

This place is a MUST EAT here if you live in Brampton or decide to make the trek from downtown for one of the best sandwiches you will have in your life!"}
{"text":"I decided to check out this place after hearing great reviews and being featured on tv. It was definitely a hidden gem in the heart of downtown Brampton! 

FOOD: ordered the Beefeater sandwich and my bf ordered the Beanasaurus...both sandwiches were massive and delicious! The beef brisket in the Beefeater sandwich was cooked to perfection and the bun had a nice soft texture. I highly recommend either of these two Po-Boy sandwiches.

AMBIENCE: nice chill dine in restaurant serving quality beer and whiskey

SERVICE: we came on a Sunday late afternoon so it wasn't busy but the service was pretty top notch and professional. It's always nice when the waitress comes over and asks how everything is even in a non-fancy restaurant.

Definitely coming back to try the other Turkey Waffle sandwich!"}
{"text":"Family-owned/run place on George st. in historic Brampton. Don't let this place's size fool you, it may be quaint but their food is HUGE!

Full of great flavors there's something for every tastebud! I can't decide if I like the \"Pulled pork & beanasaurus\" or the \"turkey & waffles\" PoBoy more...let's conclude that its a tie and if I could I probably would eat them both.

Also- they put a lot of love into their meals...you will taste the dedication in each bite.
Try their Portuguese Pop (Sumol) soon good!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the woman that served us was very friendly. We ate in and ordered the full rack of ribs special and the the pressed brisket sandwich with a side of mac & cheese . It was all delicious."}
{"text":"John Catucci from the Food Network says \"You Gotta Eat Here\"; well, I say you gotta come and judge for yourself. 

Free one hour parking across the street at the City Hall Parking garage, no validation needed for free hour OR you can park there for free on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. Few Green P parking spaces out front.

Friendly staff that know the menu and can give recommendations.

TRIED:

ATBs aka Jalapeño poppers - bacon (limp and pale) wrapped jalapeños (not whole jalapeños) stuffed with cheese, chorizo and dates. I didn't feel the flavor of the date and jalapeño were complimentary, but the sweet chili aioli sauce that it was served with was excellent.

Caesar salad - greens and dressing were meh but the croutons were nice and crisp (tastes home made) as was the deliciously crisp bacon.

Pulled pork sandwich - bread soft but chewy, lots of onions and bread, needs more filling especially meat. Lots of pieces of \"bark\" scattered throughout sandwich if that's your thing. Kinda bland but perked up after I used the delicious sweet, smoky and spicy aioli sauce that came with the Jalapeño poppers.

Would be willing to come back to try their famous po boys minus the okra and mac and cheese please."}

{"text":"Take a couple of awesome brothers Jason and Jonathon who have a dream. The dream is to offer the best and true to their beliefs in the best that comes out of a smoker bbq

The slow smoked wings are a must and I suggest the dry rub as a start

Now shift your attention to the Brisket and ask for extra house gravy because it's just that good

Now loosen your belt a notch and jump into the hot smoked salmon po boy. Whaaaat?  Yeah I know but these crazy brothers have taken a family recipe and shared it with the world

Take that smoked salmon and add a red onion slaw for some crunch with a caper silo and delicious fried sweet pickles.  Grab some knapkins and chow down.

The smarties will split the hot smoked salmon and split it with a turkey and waffles.  This is why you eat in pairs and share.

So take a pile of smoked turkey medallions and a freshly made waffle and top it with sweet chili and breaded calamari and fried red and green peppers and it's foodie heaven 

I strongly suggest the Caldo Verde soup...home made and the collard greens are good for you

The brothers are making their momma proud in authentic food just for you"}
{"text":"John Catucci once said I had to eat here. I was pretty happy to see my city on \"You Gotta Eat Here.\" Not to mention, I definitely did enjoy the place when I was last in.

When I came around, I've been here about three times before writing my actual review on this place. What I noticed is that most of the food that I've tried such as the pulled pork sandwich, ATB's, Mac & Cheese, and so on is that though they were delicious... There was nothing to really put them over the top.

The other issue I had was an inattentive server. I brought a few friends with me the third time I came in and while we were seated promptly, we decided on what we wanted to eat but had to wait 45 minutes because the waitress was busy with another table. When we were finally tended to, it felt as though we were forgotten and had just been seated, as if the waitress didn't know...

You really need to come here and see it for yourself. This isn't one of those over the top amazing places that Brampton has to offer, there are better... But if you're in the area and just want to grab a bite, I'd say why not."}
{"text":"Anybody who thinks there's anything great about this place only does because they've never left Brampton. We ordered the Mac and cheese bites to start and they were hot on the outside and freezing cold on the inside. That tells me 2 things: they're frozen and whoever is cooking them doesn't know how to do so. Totally bush league! Second, ordered one of our sandwiches with cheese and they forgot it. Again bush league but mistakes happen. We told them about the cheese and they took the sandwich back only to return it a minute later with pre-shredded marble sprinkled on it, again cold and un-melted. Totally bush league.

All I can say about this place is that it's totally bush league. Average sandwiches drowned in either sugary or salty sauces. Anyone can do that."}
{"text":"Ok this place is seriously amazing! I wouldn't usually drive to Brampton for food but this place I would totally do that! 

  The flavours are insane the food top quality and the owners are just awesome. So polite and funny, super passionate about what they do! That's important when it comes to a good food joint. 

  I tried a bunch of things but honestly cannot say what I liked best! Every sandwich I had was ridiculously good, if say go with a friend order two and do half and half. Because you're going to want to try them all!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of coming to this place tonight and who knew about a this hidden gem tucked away in a side street of Brampton. this small family run restaurant serves some tasty combinations like the turkey and waffle sandwich. Who would have thought about this combination? The two brothers who spent 6 months perfecting this recipe! The combination of sweet, savory and spicy was balanced quite well. 

The highlight of the night were the bacon wrapped Jalepenos stuffed with cream cheese portuguese sausage and dates! I could have eaten an entire tray and would have been satisfied!

Its got a small bar feel and with friendly staff and owners its easy to feel welcome and one of regulars!

Its no surprise why \"You Gotta Eat Here\". Now you really Gotta here there!"}
{"text":"They definitely deserve their 5 stars. We had the beanasauraus sandwich and it was enough to feed two people. I only ate half. My boyfriend tried the half Portuguese chicken meal with potato skins and it was amazing. It was Smokey and very juicy. The potato skins had paprika and other spices that serve to enhance the humble potato skin, it was very soft and cooked through. We also tried the mac and cheese, for me this was the weakest part of the meal but my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed it. This is the third time we've ordered from this location through skip the dishes and they have never disappointed us. I suggest the BBQ platter, it's amazing and it's such a large portion that you can share."}
{"text":"Great spot in downtown brampton to get a Bite to eat. While I know that they are known for their sandwiches I elected to try out the 1/2 chicken meal. I was not disappointed in the quality and taste of the meat and the fries were amazing as they are tossed in a great seasoning mix. They have a nice little patio and decent selection of bottles beers (only mill street on tap). 

The only real Complaint I have is that the don't have bottled ketchup and instead give you a whole bunch of small packets of the generic stuff. It's not a huge deal but you'd think a relatively well off restaurant would be able to facilitate a bottle of ketchup. 

Overall it's a great spot for a nice meal"}
{"text":"Great food amazing service. ATBs are a must. Ribs could have been in the smoker for a bit longer, were a tad chewy but still delish! Would go back and take more people with me."}
{"text":"I had my first visit here today. I tried the pulled pork beanasaurus and mac and cheese. I enjoyed the sandwich it had a very nice smoky taste and coleslaw was mild but pleasant. The beans gave it a chilli dog kind of taste. Should have requested a little more BBQ sauce on it though. The mac n cheese was good. I am not a big fan of mac n cheese but this is something I am sure my daughter and some friends would really enjoy. I plan to try a few more things on the menu over the summer and will update a final verdict. As for now I would say check this place out. It is the best smoke meat shop in Brampton I have been too"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've noticed the owners here post very heated responses and even got previous negative reviews flagged or hidden somehow.  Let me save you the trouble and tell you don't bother calling me a shill or anything like that; I genuinely did not enjoy your food here at all.  Take the criticism and build from it, stop acting dramatic and making it sound like everyone is out to get you.

We live nearby, and I've been here a total of 3 or 4 times, and was thoroughly disappointed on every single visit.  My little brother even played hockey with one of the two brothers, even has a nickname for him, so trust me when we tell you we genuinely went in here wanting to like the place.

Let's start with their \"Beanasaurus\" pulled pork sandwich.  Calling it the beanasaurus is definitely a wise choice because the pork is bland as hell, reheated, and the entire sandwich tastes ONLY of beans.  No smoke ring or noticeable smoke flavor at all to be found in the pork itself.  Not an offensive sandwich, but very very ordinary and bland as anything..

\"Beefeater\" sandwich fares a little better I guess, my buddy says it's the only good thing on the entire menu and I'd agree that it's \"decent\" but still not very good.  Main complaints, again, is that the meat itself doesn't taste smoked in the least, and is very bland.  The beef is completely grey and cooked through, and there is no evidence of smoking via a smoke ring or anything like that at all.  The \"okra shrimp crunch\" topping is mostly okra and little miniature shrimps that nobody likes.  You'd be way better off breading and frying respectable sized shrimp and just cutting them down to size to spread them out.  

Tried their \"brisket sandwich panini with cheese\" on another visit and AGAIN, it's just underseasoned, undersmoked, and bland, but with the added bonus of oozing grease as well.  It's just boring reheated sliced meat topped with cheese that doesn't seem to compliment it at all, pushed in a panini press.  Squished the sandwich with my hands after a lackluster first couple of bites and it was just swimming in grease, didn't even bother finishing it.

Now lets address their ridiculous misspelling of \"ABT's\".  ABT's are a common appetizer consisting of deseeded jalepenos stuffed with cream cheese and chorizo, wrapped in bacon, then smoked.  Well, Sul Irmaos called them \"ATB's\", completely misspelling it, and when asking them why they are called something different they tell me \"It's just our spin on it\"..  Your spin on it is ripping off a different dish then misspelling it without even changing anything?  What??  I don't get this at all.  ABT's stand for something, ATB's don't.  There's no unique spin on it to justify bastardizing the name!  The ABT's themselves were ultra soggy, the bacon was totally limp and had no crisp edge to it at all, leading me to believe that these were cooked WELL in advance and reheated to order.  7 bucks gets you 5 tiny ones.

French fries, hideous.  Among the worst I have ever had.  Soggy, limp, fried at the completely wrong temperature, and probably incorrect method as well.  Good fries should be at the least double fried when you're doing them fresh cut.  If you're cutting a bunch of misshappen fries and single frying them, the water has not evaporated from the potatoes themselves and they just suck up all the fryer oil while never getting crispy.

Potato Skins are not like you imagine; there is no nicely halved or scooped out potatoes stuffed with cheese, bacon, chives, or sour cream.  Their potato skins are literally the crusty peeled skins from the outside of the potatoes, fried like a potato chip, and overloaded with BBQ seasoning.  At least these are cooked better than the french fries, so if you're going to do a side dish, these should be them.

Breaded Mac & Cheese bites are like 6 or 7 bucks for 5 tiny \"bites\".  Horrible value.  Then they stick them in a gigantic styrofoam box, to get you excited, but when you open the box up, there is nothing inside except a miserable little portion that will just make you angry.  Taste of these aren't too bad either but can't be justified due to the horrible value

The icing on the cake to all of this is the time that we tried requesting an added condiment to a buddies sandwich.  The brother tells us that adding the condiment was \"our risk\" and they don't recommend it because it doesn't match the \"flavor profile\" they carefully constructed.  WHAT?  Is your ego that big, really?

The rest of the menu just sounds bizarre and unappealling as a whole.  Turkey and waffle sandwich instead of chicken?  Huh?

I am seriously disappointed in the previous Yelpers glowing reviews of the place until I observed that most of them are suspiciously new reviewers.  

I have a lot of mutual friends of these two brothers on Facebook, but the only people I ever hear talking about it are friends of theirs shilling the place

Guys, don't take the criticism personal, if you change anything, let us know"}
{"text":"I can't complain about the food, as you can see from previous reviews, I'll give them that.
My main complain is their service, or lack of service I should say. 
I've only tried their chicken with side order of fries. 
The fries is nothing to rave about. The chicken however is amazing. 
My main complain is their ability to follow an order properly. I've ordered food from Sul Irmaos three times so far. 
The first time I picked up and made sure I got the extra sauce in the side that they charge you $1 for. (Really????? That little bit of extra sauce only costs you MAYBE 5 cents.) 
The other 2 times I ordered through skip the dishes and because they don't have an option to ask for extra sauce, I called them personally and asked for extra sauce. Well they forgot BOTH times. 
Which I then had to get dressed, get in my car and drive there and get the f-ing extra sauce. 
What is the point of being in a food delivery app when you can't follow a simple order. 
When I called to complain the second time I was told \"sorry about that, come pick it up and we won't charge you for the extra sauce\" what a joke!!!!! 
I moved to Brampton six months ago and let me tell you I've already started looking for another restaurant to go to for my chicken."}
{"text":"Brampton's best kept secret! These guys were featured on Food Network's \"You Gotta Eat Here\", and for good reason!! Try the ATBs and the Beefeater sandwich"}
{"text":"Sul Irmaos Smoke House is the place to be, if you are looking for love and you haven't been here, you my friend are looking in all the wrong places. It's been on the famous show, You Gotta Eat Here Canada. That definitely says something about this place. First of all do you like Bacon? And do you like Jalapeños? Then you better get on those ATBS. \"Bacon-wrapped Jalapenos stuffed with cream cheese and Portuguese Chorizo,and a date smoked for 2 hours. Served with a sweet chili aioli sauce\" Sounds Amazing right? It is hella good! As for the Po Boys Sandwiches they are to die for. We got a pint size of 3 of their sandwiches and let me tell you I was not disappointed in any of them. The descriptions speak for themselves. The Beefeater - \"Southern slow smoked brisket, deep fried okra-shrimp crunch, and collard greens; served with Creole mustard, house gravy, and caesar dressing.\" Pulled Pork and Beanasaurus - \"Southern slow smoked pulled pork, kettle cooked baked beans, creamy slaw, and fried mac and cheese bites.\" Last but not least, (and my favourite) Turkey and Waffles - \"Fried turkey medallions and gravy, sweet thai dipped waffles topped with calamari, and red peppers.\" Need I say more? Go get some Portuguese Lovin' Smokehouse Style. Jimstar Out!!!"}
{"text":"A nice place in the downtown of the city of Brampton. Parking is street side or available in the City Hall parking garage just across the road. Small place, but nice ambiance.

We had Beefeater, fries and potato skin... the Beefeater is \"huge\", the fries are really great. 
The Server was very friendly and helpful with great service."}
{"text":"I had a hard time deciding what to order because so much of the menu looked interesting and tempting. I ended up with good ol' ribs and wings: ribs I can never resist, and wings because the Portuguese hot sauce sounded intriguing (I don't recall the name but it wasn't a typical piri piri). Both were very good, and notably smokey.  The ribs are a special, only on Sundays at the moment. I loved the seasoning on the fries.  The Caesar looked top quality but tasted a bit bland.   


For those with unadventurous kids like mine: they didn't like the fries.  Also the honey BBQ ribs had a tiny, nearly undetectable bit of heat so of course my kids wouldn't eat them.  I was told that if you alert the server upfront they will be able to accommodate.  The kids did like the Mac and cheese bites, and the Caesar actually!

If I lived or worked close by, I think I'd be here all the time. I hope I can make it back again soon."}
{"text":"The exterior of this place is nothing to write home about (or write on Yelp about, for that matter!), but the food is terrific.

Sat on the patio, had a beer after ordering. The patio affords a sweeping view of the back end of city hall (ie. not much to see). But again, this place is about the food.

Had a gargantuan-sized po' boy sandwich. I mean massive. Nine times out of ten I would take half to go, but this time my appetite was up for it. And often, a large portion means anything but good taste (I'm looking at you, Boston Pizza!). But this thing was de-lish!

Would go back. Would take friends. Heck, would even ride the damn LRT from Port Credit to eat here.

Not a first date place, unless you're okay with a first impression being you devouring a sandwich.

UPDATE:
For the first time in about five visits, I tried something different on the menu (if you try the Beanasaurus, you'll understand why I stuck with it. I mean, macaroni in a po' boy?!). Tried their po' boy version of a Philly cheese steak. The steak was great, but a little thin on the other ingredients. I'm used to a Philly cheese steak causing quite a mess; this didn't. Still quite delicious, but I think I'll go back to the Beanasaurus."}
{"text":"Best wings in Brampton. They're smoked and are deliciously seasoned. The caldo verde soup is great. The Po Boys are amazing, the buns don't tear up your mouth, and are enormous. Good organic beer (Mill St) or wine. Great service. Sports bar atmosphere, cozy, modern decor, with a summer patio, close to Gage Park. Free parking right across the street at City Hall."}
{"text":"After being featured on \"You Got To Eat Here\" and we were nearby in Brampton my wife and I decided to pay a visit. Small place nearby the City Hall and that's why the mayor gets her lunch there I guess! I ordered the \"Beefeater\" which is their signature sub...what a disappointment? It has no beef! 2 thinly sliced cheap beef with lots of fried okra and a mustard aioli for $10.80. I shared my vision with the people around me in the patio and all of us had the same view. By the end of the meal which took too long to come, all the three tables at the patio spoke to the waitress about the disappointment..the neighboring table told her \"if you call it Beefeater then it should contain some F***ing beef. My wife has smoked salmon sub and wasn't great again the size of the salmon piece was disappointing. I told the waitress (who speak loudly and she doesn't know that) I don't mind paying $15 for a good sub but please put some beef in it. I wouldn't go again, any new place on these TV programs has one chance only."}
{"text":"macaroni bites are awesome. Sandwiches were just OK in our opinion. Taste was a bit dry and bland but quality was good. Extremely filling comfort food. Probably won't be back though, not our cup of tea. Would be nice to see more variety on menu for those who aren't partial to big bready sandwiches. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"I need to write this review, because I've been blathering to coworkers and even strangers how awesome this place was!

So, Lee and I were pondering our choices for dinner, we had already had a pretty great lunch earlier in the day, and we were maybe thinking something lighter.

\"How about this place, it's got lots of good ratings?\"

Ha, yeah it's just a sandwich place, sure, it will be light. HA.

So we stopped in, and were shown to a table. The whole place is pretty nice, right downtown, near the central park area. It's warm and comfortable.

The server asked if we were there because we'd seen the place on \"You Gotta Eat Here\" (which is Canada's classier version of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.) Nope, we hadn't even seen the episode. 

She made a couple of recommendations as to which were their most popular sandwiches, which are the Beefeater and the Pulled Pork and Beanasaurus. She also suggested that a lot of people order two different sandwiches and then switch halves, an idea that we were totally behind. They were running out of the mac and cheese bites, so we ordered the last Pulled pork and Beanasaurus, and we also ordered the Turkey and Waffles. For starters, we tried the ATBs, which are bacon wrapped jalapenos, stuffed with cream cheese, dates and house-made chorizo. Those were pretty delicious!

We ordered a couple of beers, munched on the ATBs, and awaited our sandwiches.

Oh my goodness! They come on 10\" soft baguettes, and I would really love to know where they get that bread, because it was incredible! Crusty but not so much that it messes up the roof of your mouth, and just soft and warm and delicious.

So the Pulled Pork and Beanasaurus: Yummy, melting pulled pork that wasn't sweet (one of Lee's pet peeves, he hates sugary barbecue sauce.) it was smoky and beany and the little bits of mac and cheese added a nice cheesy pop.

The Turkey and Waffle: I hate to use cliches, but it was a complete flavor explosion and texture sensation in my mouth. I'm still thinking about it today! It was nice smoked turkey, the thai sauce on the waffles was just incredibly yummy. 

So if you are ever anywhere near Brampton. GO HERE. You will not regret it. My regret is I live an hour and a half and an international border away, or I would be back ASAP to try all the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Wow , have been wanting to try this place since I first saw it on you gotta eat here. My daughter and I ordered the PoBoy sandwiches. I had the pulled pork beanasurus and she had the turkey and waffle. We also shared the Mac & Cheese starter. The Mac was steaming hot and cheesy goodness. Then the sandwiches came out, they are monstrosities filled and overflowing. My pulled pork was amazing and my daughters turkey was also delicious( yeah a had a few bites ) I was going to only heat half and save the other half for later but I couldn't stop myself from finishing the whole thing. My daughter did have some left over but she's the lucky one who gets to enjoy it later for a snack. 
Glad I was able to finally get to this place. I will be back to try some of the other amazing looking dishes I saw on the menu. A must visit place in Brampton."}
{"text":"Good food, great even. So much to learn about how to handle a rush it seems. 

Was quoted a 25 wait for a table so instead opted for a takeout order. That was at 7:50pm on a Saturday. She said 20-25 mins. 

My wife questioned the logic in waiting for takeout when a table would take the same amount of time. Figured we could use the time for a beer run up the road at the LCBO. 

Get back to the restaurant at 8:30 and they're still not done. The wait staff are frantic. There are annoyed retirees all over the place. The waitress asks the cook how long \"just give me 10 more minutes!\" Exasperated. 

So here I am 20 mins later writing a review on my phone while a sexual saxophone plays to the time of my groaning stomach. Do I get a refund and grab mcdonalds? It's seeming like a better idea the more sensually the live saxophonist plays. 

I've eaten here before, it's still almost worth the wait. Now the chef is whining about needing water and a waitress about needing a bathroom break. This might be my sandwich. 

Pack a lunch if you're waiting for dinner.

The sandwiches were great. The service was friendly, but overwhelmed."}
{"text":"We ordered the po boy Beefeater to share for $10.95. I didnt think it was huge since my bf and I were planning to go food hopping in downtown brampton. The sandwich was massive and it was sooooo good! Shrimp, okra and beef can actually go together! Service was slow but pleasant and thats why I saw so many customers doing pick up or take out. I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"We got takeout from here for work and everyone enjoyed their sandwiches. Everyone had either steak sandwich, beefeater, or veal sandwich and all were a hit.
I had the beefeater and it was delicious. I like shrimp but personally didn't think they added much to this sandwich, but I liked the okra. The beef was lean which is my preference and the sandwich was enormous.. almost couldn't finish it. The mustard had an awesome zest to it so the sandwich was perfectly flavoured. Absolutely no complaints about my meal, definitely don't agree with some of the compliments saying it was just sliced sandwich meat warmed up? It was thinly sliced -- not a chunky brisket like I'm used to -- but if that's sliced roast beef I need to find out where this deli is because it was great.
PS I enjoyed trying the Sumol drink :)"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are huge and full of flavours, friendly staff and I actually got to meet one of the owners ( I believe there are 2 brothers) super nice guy and I gotta give props to entrepreneurs who are passionate about their work. You can see they really take pride in their business"}
{"text":"These guys are on point.  Great flavor combination in the Beefeater. Not too saucy.  Fried okra remained crunchy through the whole sandwich.  And bread was perfectly soft and chewy.  Lots of good texture throughout.  I love hitting local gems like this.  Plus, I got a review in before they blow-up."}
{"text":"We ordered the Beefeater and the pulled pork po boy. My goodness it was very fresh and yummy. We came on the weekend early in the day and it wasn't busy. Welcomed by the 2 owners. We both preferred the pulled pork over the beefeater. 

I personally think the flavour of the pulled pork matched and was well balanced with the slaw. Eating it was a little messy but no complains :) The price was fair compared to most places I've been to but definitely 

Made a mistake and should have tried the ATBs, but was quite full so maybe next time. I will definitely stop by again if ever in the area.

Free parking on weekends over at the city hall. Covered indoor parking."}
{"text":"This place is great, mouth watering. Delicious sandwiches and so filling and so cheap"}
{"text":"The staff and atmosphere is very nice 

The wait time for food is long it took me 35mins to get my po boy and no one was a head of me,  the Main dishes are good such as the beenasoraus but some other dishes are disappointing such as the butter chicken po boy.  

Overall great place for a bite"}
{"text":"Sul Irmaos (Southern Brothers) does have an interesting sandwich menu. Love the different combination of elements but does those work in a sandwich? 

But I found out after the first bite of The Beefeater ($8.75) - Southern Slow Smoked Brisket, Deep Fried Okra-Shrimp Crunch, Collard Greens, served with Creole Mustard, that I dislike okra a lot more than I realized! Even deep frying it not helping at all. The beef though tender, has a texture of roast beef instead of brisket!

I though really enjoyed the Pulled Pork Beanasaurus ($8.75) - Southern Slow Smoked Pulled Pork,  Baked Beans,  Slaw and Fried Mac & Cheese Bites. The combination of the ingredients gave it a interesting flavour. I heart Mac & Cheese Bites!!

Sul Irmaos being a smokehouse, I do find the meat lack any smokiness in both beef brisket and pulled pork. 

Owner/Server was super nice and friendly. I don't mind coming back again to try out other sandwiches when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are out this world. Wings are really good too. Im so happy we found this gem in our town."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Came here twice over the last few days and the food is fantastic. Had the pulled pork Po Boy, which has Mac and cheese and beans. Huge sandwich! Second visit I had the smoked chicken. It is fall off the bone tender with just the right amount of seasoning and smoke. 
The seasoned fries are Ok, I prefer crispier fries but my friend liked them fine. Just a personal preference. I would go for the skins or slaw next time. 
Definitely worth checking this place out. If I lived close by I would be here a couple times a week just for the chicken. It is truly amazing."}
{"text":"By far some of the best food in brampton . Had the beefeater one of the best sandwiches ive had in the gta and the coleslaw was perfect fresh addition to any of there sandwiches. Must try place"}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork Po Bo Sandwich which had cut cabbage, fried mac and cheese ( yummy) and beef chilli. 10 inch sandwich sure was tasty. The sandwich had a lot of flavours and was huge surprisingly not to messy either.  The only downside was that there is no near by parking.
There is a parking garage opposite if the place were parking is free for 1 hour."}
