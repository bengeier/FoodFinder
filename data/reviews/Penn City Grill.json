{"text":"Don't come here is your a hotel guest and looking for a quick bite to eat.   Slow service.  The place was only one-third filled and it took them 5 minutes to greet me.  Your a big hotel restaurant... You should be able to handle the needs of your hotel guests."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Food is ok. Atmosphere is ok. Location and convenience to your hotel is amazing. Don't expect amazing food but a semi-quick bite where you can almost always get a table with no wait.

If you have time run across the street to the Taco place or Meatball place down the road. If you have extra time go to Gauchos."}
{"text":"Breakfast, Ray was a peppy as a cup of coffee, service was quick. The menu is standard and limited but they accommodated my every request. Not cheap."}
{"text":"They are nice and try hard. Apart from that all of the reviews are accurate and on point. Not going to plan on going back. It's amazing to me that all of the negative reviews span several years but that there has been no change. Where there is a will there's a way. Conversely without a will there's no way."}
{"text":"The service and food were very good.  The prices were very expensive for what you get.

We had a table of four and were promptly greeted (after we found it hidden behind the elevator).  

The meal consisted of a BLT Benedict, Turkey omelet, breakfast quesadilla and some toast with ham.

Everyone really enjoyed the food.  We even tasted each other's because there were compliments on the flavors.

That said, $66 + tip for breakfast for four is too expensive."}
{"text":"So I have a theory. The architects at the Westin really wanted to build an obstacle course as part of the hotel. And so they did. But then they couldn't figure out how to market it. So they decided to turn that obstacle course into a restaurant instead, and they called it the Penn City Grill.

Now, the food isn't too bad, and the sushi is decent. But the service is so slow and so inefficient at the Penn City Grill, that it's almost comical to watch the waitstaff run back and forth, without any rhyme or reason, because anything you ask for -- menu, silverware, napkins, check -- requires at minimum two laps around the obstacle course.

So eventually, I stopped expecting the waitstaff to come around, and just enjoyed the show. Never mind that the restaurant is at most 25% full. Stuff just takes that long.

Bravo, Penn City Grill! If that's the goal you were aiming for, you certainly succeeded."}
