{"text":"I came here for Karoeke on 7.21.2017. Worst DJ I have ever seen in my life. They dissapeared for more 20 than min during the list set. And played slash metal remixes of otgerwise great songs. 25 people left the bar while this was going on. I approached the DJ company and tried to ask why they were not playing the set I was cursed at and called derogatory names by one of the DJ members. And told I had nothing to say. They closed their set early and turned the bar lights on an hour early. Do not recommend!!"}
{"text":"Hi everyone my name is Pool Shark. Ive been to this place quite a few times and it is god awful every time.  First off there are no good looking bartenders and all they do is hire males. Secondly their food is so awful I would not even feed it to my dog. I'm pretty sure homeless people would rather starve than eat this garbage. The owner is kinda hot but her boyfriend is such a doushebag. He enjoys starting fights with the regulars. The GM is really cheap. Instead of giving you a new glass he will fill up your beer with the same glass so his water bill does not go up by having to wash it. In fact, he is so cheap he makes his own ketchup at home and keeps filling it in Heinz bottles. He tried the same thing with A1 sauce until someone called him out on it.  Finally, the pool tables are horrible. They have no sticks and the balls just roll wherever they feel like it. This place is also going bankrupt for a good reason. Save your money and time and go to a real bar where the owners Boyfriend doesn't start fights with you and you don't have to worry about drinking out of the same glass all night while staring at dudes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, friend and I went here for dinner. Gross! The best part was the jalape√±o poppers. I got the sausage and potato pancakes which were freezer burnt and unseason. My boyfriend  got the fish fry which was all breading. My friend got the open steak sandwich. She took one bite and couldn't eat anymore. No manager on duty so when we raised our concerns, they offered 10% off. Overcharged sicken food. There was one other table filled and we were ignored. Drinks were not filled. Had to stand up just to get attention. Dirty dark and neglected. The check had to be redone a few different times and it was still wrong by the time we left. The other table barely touched their food and when asked if they wanted a box, the answer was h*ll no. I left 90% of my food on the plate. Hopefully I won't have stomach issues tonight.The fast food we got afterwards tasted ten times better."}
{"text":"Yike.

I wish I read reviews before coming in. Fell for their 2 for 1 Twins Day special (found out only for alcoholic drinks).

Ordered calmari and got a tiny plate for the price. Tasted mostly the breaded coatings- hardly can taste any calmari.

Going to subway. Disappointed Twinsburg not offer many better options to eat at 4pm."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time eating here. If you just want to drink, go right ahead. But if you want some good bar food go down the street to Brewster's or Panini's. Service was subpar as well. When I went there the place was almost empty - wonder why?"}
{"text":"Nasty. Doors away from one of the best fresh seafood shops in the state.  Expensive food service salt ladden inedible waste of time and money.

Mac and cheese had no flavor. .. polluck was greasy,  soggy, horrible. 

Chicken sandwich was a salt lick.

Tarter sauce was a sugar rich mess.

Not. Again.

Heading to Brewsters for a dinner after the dinner"}
{"text":"If your going here to eat, think again! The food is terrible... honestly, it may all be frozen or from a box. When we were here we were the only ones in the restaurant which I usually don't mind, but the service was still terrible. The bartender was also trying to be our waiter and it did not work out. If your going for a drink then great, but don't come here to eat. There are many great options right down the street. I have to say that I am surprised this place is still open."}
{"text":"They water down their liquor. My friend pointed it out to me one time and i didn believe him. But last night i stopped for a tanqueray and tonic. Honestly it didnt taste like the tanqueray that i enjoy on regular basis. I had one drink and went to a different bar and ordered the same thing for less money and it had the tanqueray flavor I love. No doubt in my mind Rav's.watering down their liquor. I have tried this place more than a few times because its on my way home from work to give the place a real chance. Dont waste your money here even the food is far from good. Its below average in flavor and quality. So if you want to pay a bunch of money for watered down booze and poor food Rav's is your place."}
{"text":"Awful service. The power went out so the barkeep was super frazzled. Looks like she was waiting on the 3 tables in the dining room and 6 drunks at the bar. We won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is closed now.  Sometimes great service and good food. Other times, they are short staffed and things are just so-so. They offer daily specials and have decent prices. The place is outdated, but comfortable. Get the best service if you sit at the bar."}
{"text":"This is our first time here & we were pleasantly surprised.  It may be mainly a bar but their menu is vast & loaded with options for every person. We were very happy & will be back."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The bartender had no social skills and made me feel horribly unwelcome. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is not worth it. Went in there with high hopes and it was terrible. My wife and I wanted to order a burger and instead were told by the waitress that it had to be an entree (which was more expensive to begin with) nowhere on the groupon did it state you could not have a burger! I ordered chicken Parm and my wife got the fish fry. The chicken Parm was a giant breaded mess and had over cooked pasta beneath it. My wife only took a few bites of her fish fry. The fries were surprisingly amazing and I wish I could have gotten a burger because I bet it was good. Needless to say we won't be going back"}
{"text":"Nice sports bar. Started with garlic mussels. Yum!  Good chicken Parmesan and fried shrimp with the best potato French fries--like fair fries. Took half of each dinner home. Service was good. Music. Laughter at the bar. Bring friends. Band starts at 9."}
