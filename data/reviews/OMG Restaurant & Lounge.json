{"text":"They attempt to cook french style with high end prices, but it's far from it.  Cash only, so be aware because they charge everything!  We wanted extra bread slices, they charged us $1 for four small slices.  This is the exact same bread that Viet subs use. We wanted extra lemon for our 2 dozen oysters as it only came with two wedges, and they were going to charge us per wedge, seriously!?

The mains were mediocre.  I had the 10oz strip, but I think I lucked out and got the piece with the most tendons, as my steak knife couldn't cut through the rubber.  My mother got the pork hock, the meat was tender in the middle, but they stuck it in the deep fryer slightly too long as it was tough like jerky.  The only decent dish was the chicken wing appetizer my wife got.  it was flavorful, crispy and moist."}
{"text":"\"OMG\", its super horrible. I love oysters and have them all the time. I never thought it can be bad....I thought wrong, they exist. Taste and look bad....like I'm going to have to deal with it later tonight.....and it came out with a small green piece of paper on top, I'm guessing it was a chit. Waited a long time for our meal....and waited even longer for my dads meal. He got his when the rest of the family was nearly done. It wasn't even busy.  But all of our meals came out cold...you can tell they have been sitting at the window for a while. I found more paper in my food...looked like part of a wrapper of some sort? Oh, and a random tiny piece of chicken in my dish.....when I had ordered the smoked salmon and shrimp linguine (which was plain and tasteless). The whole experience was a turn off. There were no service, most of the servers just stood against the wall to watch us not eat. I suggest everyone to save their money."}
{"text":"If it is not introduced by one of my friend, I will not find it as not always along Victoria Park.  The first impression is that there are a lot of rules in the menu like if you share food, you have to pay extra; if you exchange an item in a menu, there is something.  Not that are those rules not common but there is a long list in the menu that is uncommon.

I heard the chef is once from previous Dicken on Highway 7.  The portion is big.  I order a steak and is pretty good.  The lobster bisque is so much better than a log of the Hong Kong style western restaurants.  The pasta is very tasty and is al dente.  I like the weekday special that it has $1 per oyster up to a maximum of a dozen.  

When the bill comes, it is around $40 per person for a sumptuous meal.  

The only comment is like some of the Hong Kong style restaurant that  I think is the owner with the baby appears once in a while and empty table is used by the management to work on laptop !"}
{"text":"If you haven't had HK style cuisine before, you should give this place a try.  For those who don't know, HK style is a take on European and American food with a uniquely Hong Kong twist.  This was the type of food that western style diners in Hong Kong served in the 1960s and you'll only find this type of restaurant in places where Hong Kongers live.

When you walk in you're greeted by a dark theme with black painted walls.  There's a solarium area where you get a lot of sunshine along with your food.  We chose to sit there and order some of the classics.  

The German pork hock looks nice and crispy and is brined just right on the inside, served with a side of jasmine rice, while I had the Ox tail in a tomato red wine sauce served Asian style, on a bubbling hot pot of sauce with a side of spaghetti.  Our table also had pork chops with rice, and salmon linguine.

Prices are quite reasonable even at dinner time, with the average HK style combo costing under $20.  With the combo, you get a choice of HK style borsch (cabbage and tomato) soup or cream soup (in this case clam chowder).  You also get your choice of coffee, tea, lemon tea, lemon water for after dinner.  Add a little to the bill if you want those drinks iced.

if you've never had HK style food before, give this place a try for a blend of East and West."}
{"text":"This place is pretty crowded during lunch, it's a HK/western place. There are a variety of dishes, but my favourite is the chicken steak with noodles and extra sauce. What I like about this place is that they start you off with some bread and soup, I love their cream of chicken, then comes your entree, and finally you get some coffee or tea to wash down your meal. All of that for under $10, a pretty good deal of you ask me."}
{"text":"I personally went there twice for lunch and it was not bad.

I went with my group of friends this time for dinner and I was (we all) so disappointed on the food this time.  I ordered the Rack of Lamb with Truffle Cream Sauce on Rice which I never expect truffle cream sauce was strong but I have no clue that why I can strongly taste the Chinese mushroom taste instead.  I ordered medium rare of my Rack of Lamb and it comes at medium well.  The soup was just warm.  My Caesar Salad became Green Salad.  We also ordered one dozen of oysters and they forgot our order and came after the main course.  One of my friend ordered fish but the fish was over cooked!!!

The waitress was nice but we all believe she was a new hire (keep mix up our orders), but the food this time (which cost me $28.99+$3.00 for upgrade as a meal+$1.5 of cold drink + tax +tips) with such quality I definitely wont go back again!"}
{"text":"For the special seafood & steak combo ($100/ 4 people)

Reservation is mandatory. 

Extra head is additional $25

Balsamic vinegar and olive oil with bread sucks it was cold and just crappy.

You're allowed fillet and steak to share but you can only cook the steak one way (ie. All rare or all med rare or all med etc). I'd you ask them to do it differently they basically brush you off or still give you the same thing. I ordered one 30% and others 50%, they were all 50% .... and wasn't amazing. 

The muscles were kinda sour. But sauce/ broth was decent.

The fois gras wad typical ... I've had better but the biscuit it was on was so hard and cold it became chewy.

The seafood pasta was the same sauce as the fillet ........ 

Service was slow but then again it was busy ... 

I almost had to beg for them to change my plate for me.

Mash potatoes were real potatoes. 

Dessert is good but not made in-house.

You cannot use any other promotions along with this one (eg. Promo price oysters).

So this meal really ruined my experience for me. When I ordered from the other menus i actually liked it better."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better HK-styled Western restaurants in the area, especially with the low pricing! I really liked that there was balsamic+olive oil to dip my bread into. 

My mom found the baked pork casserole to be too different from the usual version (the sauce was more tomato-ee, there were a bajillion vegetables), but she applauded the attempt at trying something different.

My red wine sauce braised ox tail was pretty darn tasty. The sauce had a distinct, rich flavor to it and I could definitely taste a bit of that wine. The ox tail itself was tender, easily falling off the bone, and the sauce went perfectly with the meat (along with the rice, the bread, the leftover pork from my mom's dish...)

In any case, this is definitely a pretty good place to go for a nice, affordable lunch. I'm definitely going to try dinner there! For a full review (and more pictures!) please visit my blog, conveniently located in my profile. :) Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went to this place because we were racking our brains trying to find a place to sit and eat and was close to work.  We found this place because we ran out of ideas and didn't want to go to Subway again.  The lunch special is a choice of an entree (a lot to choose from), a soup, and a drink.  There were three of us so we ordered three entrees to share.  We ordered a Portuguese baked chicken on rice, stewed beef brisket, and one more dish that I don't remember (it probably wasn't that memorable).  Anyhow the taste of the food was so-so, but it was hot (it was a chilly day and all I ask was the food to be hot).  The soup was bland...I ordered the cream of corn...terrible choice...never again.   The price wasn't bad...the total for all three of us including tip was $30.  I would come back again and try their other dishes at lunch.  We'll see how it goes."}
{"text":"Had a lamp and pasta. 
Seafood pasta, tasteless , really bad. 
Lamp is ok, just tasted like you can buy and cook by yourself from supermarket. 
Soups, ok, taste like can food.
Oyster , fresh.
So, overall ~ not recommended for 2nd time."}
{"text":"I've been passing by this place for a while, never suspecting it had much business as it seems to be all by itself in an industrial street and besides a service station (They share the building with another restaurant operation...not sure of the name).  The yelp reviews seemed OK enough to give it a try for lunch.  Went at about 1:30 today (a Thursday) expecting the place to be empty.  What a surprise that the place was still almost full and we had to wait a couple of minutes for a table to be cleaned off for us.  Place is small, perhaps it could squeeze in about 40 diners at a time (depending on how many people could squeeze into the 2 or 3 large booths.  We had a couple of the lunch specials ($6.99 including soup and tea/coffee).  The portions are large and the quality acceptable.  These HK style cafe operations all seem to have their own take on the similar dishes, so taste is very much an individual opinion.  Service was scattered but friendly and parking is a big plus by Scarborough standards.  There is a Dickens connection...apparently the chef use to be with the Dickens near Midland and Finch?)  We will be back to try other dishes and this place definitely has the potential for 4 stars or higher."}
{"text":"We both ordered the Chicken Steak & Foie Gras option which also came with mashed potatoes and vegetables (grilled zucchini and yellow peppers).

The foie gras was a decent size and was soft and fatty.  It was yummy!  I really enjoy foie gras.  The chicken steak was very juicy and tender with the thick skin still on.  I also adored the gravy which paired perfectly with the mashed potatoes.  Yum!  It was such an enjoyable and satisfying meal."}
{"text":"OMG there's no air conditioning and it was 30 degrees.

OMG my mom is so awesome for asking them about the radio promotion that they neglected to mention (buy half a dozen oysters and get a half dozen free). 

Yesterday was mom's actual birthday.  We had already taken her out for an official birthday dinner, and today we unofficially brought her to OMG because she had heard a promotion on the radio, and we thought it'd be nice for mom NOT to have to cook on her special day.

We arrived around 6:30PM to a relatively empty restaurant.  Other than us, there was only one other table.  Their servers dress in a logo-ed black polo t-shirt and denim shorts?  The restaurant is relatively small as Jennifer K. mentioned and at maximum capacity could probably fit about 30 people tops.  There are plasma TVs showing whatever the HK Pop Star concert of the day would be.  

As mentioned by previous Yelpers, this is an HK-style Western restaurant.  Oysters are $1 each, and the promotion is buy 6, get 6 free BUT one of the diners has to upgrade to a combo dinner (e.g. add $3 and you get soup/hot drink).  

Bread was served with balsamic vinegar and butter.  I think they add sugar to their balsamic vinegar as it is sweeter than usual.  The bread was warm and quite tasty!  But then again you are talking to a bread-a-holic!

We ordered the oysters to start.  They were served with a cocktail sauce and lemon wedges.  The oysters were pretty fresh and velvety.  A bottle of Tabasco was also brought - but I missed the usual horseradish accompaniment dearly.  We also opted for the Clam Chowder which was creamy and flavourful and was especially good if you dipped your bread into it!

For mains, my dad ordered the Grilled Chicken Steak which came with vegetables and rice.  It was nothing special and tasted like every other HK-Style Café version I've tried.  My mom opted for the Seafood Angel Hair Pasta who's sauce base was rather bland and came from the natural seafood juices of the clams/mussels that came with it.  If you don't like heavy sauces, this would be good for you - but add some salt!

I ordered the Malaysian Pork which was a curry-style pork and Jennifer K was right - it was SPICY!  So spicy for me that I started sweating, and the spiciness of the dish impeded me from tasting any other flavours that were present in the dish.  I had it with a side of rice.  I will add though that the pork was quite tender, although the tendons could've used more cooking time as they weren't tender enough for me.  

The HK-style Milk Tea was pretty weak and lacked any real tea flavour to it.  

Verdict:

For the prices they charge, the service was mostly absent, and the food was pretty unexciting.  I will stick with my usual Lai Doh Restaurant who has a much more extensive menu offering, cheaper prices, and better tasting food."}
{"text":"Lunch special is a pretty good price. Bread, soup, main dish, and drink for around 6-10 dollars depending on what you get. Escargot is really nice and buttery. The lunch cream soup tasted like nothing. The seafood pasta with rose sauce has a good amount of seafood but lacked flavour. 

Honestly, the dinner is soooo much better. Albeit more expensive, the food has a lot more flavour and bigger portions. The chicken steak with foie gras is huuuuuge. The mashed potatoes are really good too. The raw oysters are yummy, they have a special where raw oysters are $1 each with purchase of dinner special. 

Overall, this place has good food but some misses. Service is very attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Expensive. However, some dishes are very large portioned, so it can be shared. 

Overall, it's mediocre."}
{"text":"This is actually one of the best HK styled Western restaurants i have been to in the GTA area in a long time. Their dishes are reasonably priced, and they know how to provide a good service to its customers !

I have ordered their Chicken Casserole in a Bacon and Spinach sauce and it was one of the best things I have ever eaten. I can't wait to try their other dishes, especially their curry !

{"text":"I give this place 2 months tops! Combos suck! Waitress clueless!
Oh and conveniently NO lobster today with the $100 combo for 4. Heard of adding $$ to cold drinks which is normal. We ordered 4 hot horlicks oh n conveniently  $1 extra charge each! Lol are you fkin* kidding me!? Add $ for this add $ for that. I'm surprised they didn't make us add $1 for heat!

Definitely 1st and last time!"}
{"text":"This is the second time since 2 yrs ago that I being here. It has improved since then. The chicken wings a huge. The curry tasted very good. The pork chops are nicely done. The place felt comfortable. The reason it's not 5 star is because when the owner comes to your table and know one of your friend, it is a manner to introduce yourself to others. He came and sat down to talk to my friend and we are all looking at him and not once he introduced himself. Otherwise this is a good restaurant to eat."}
{"text":"went to try this place because of the oyster promotion, buy one get one free. and i think it was $1 each? however you had to make your entree into a meal (+$3) which includes a soup & hot drink (extra for cold drink). And the oyster came in 2 seconds after we ordered it! which makes me think that it can't be fresh?
this promotion in a way I felt it was a trick to make us spend more money... we spent over $60 on dinner for 2, I don't mind if the service or food was good. 

The service was slow, they didn't really understand English.

the bread with the olive oil + balsamic vinegar was the only tasty part of the whole meal. we choose from the chef selections, had a lamb dish and another chicken one... wasn't good enough to remember it.... I know 
we will never return.

CASH ONLY if you had oysters."}
{"text":"We came for weekday lunch. Upon looking at their lunch menu, I was struck by how many additional charges there are. I have since deleted the photo evidence, but it's $3.50 more to add puff pastry to your soup. It's about $1 more if you want a horlick, if I'm not mistaken, and more than that if you want a cold drink. It costs $0.50 if you want sauce on the side. It costs $0.25 for a takeout container. It costs money if you want to change from spaghetti to a different kind of pasta (not that I could see they have any other kinds of noodles one would traditionally call 'pasta' on the menu). I believe they also have a seating limit of an hour at lunch. Well, it's written on their menu. These restrictions made me wonder what the rest of our experience would be like.

Got the baked chicken in spinach and bacon cream sauce on rice ($8.25? $8.50?). It came with soup and a very limited choice of drinks. 

We were told the cream soup of the day was bacon and corn the first time we asked. That sounded good to me, so I ordered it. Usually, I order the borscht at Chinese restaurants because it's more flavorful than the cream soups. I figured the bacon might help with this one. When my aunt ordered after I did, she asked again what the cream soup was. She was told it was corn and clam. That made it less preferably for me than borscht, but in the interest of not complicating things, I just didn't say anything. It tasted like most Chinese style cream soups. Bland. The complimentary bread was soft and pillowy, so my soup ended up being a dip for my bread. Yeah. I'm that kind of girl.

The baked rice was a decent size. I appreciate that it had a fried rice base, and not just white rice. The chicken was tender and tasted fine. The cream sauce was better than the cream sauce (because it did have a few small specks of bacon in it that added some smokiness to the sauce), but I expected my spinach and bacon cream sauce to be a spinachy, smokey cream sauce, and not a cream sauce with small bits of bacon, and a smattering of spinach leaves strewn over my dish. It's more of an English issue than a flavor issue. I think it would have made more sense to call it baked chicken with spinach in bacon cream sauce. It was not bad in taste though.

My mom had the caesar salad with pork chop cutlet. The pork chop was not very big, and we've had better pork cutlets at food courts for cheaper. The caesar salad was not even as good as Pizza Hut's. This one had a few small bits of what we're assuming was bacon, a few croutons, and caesar dressing. Perhaps there was a bit of cheese. Somehow, I doubt it. 

The food here is okay, but OMG isn't a place I'd go out of my way to go to again."}
{"text":"Ordered the special set the has pasta, steak and fish.

NOTE:  if you are going with a group of people just know that they only let you choose the ONE LEVEL of \"done-ness\" for special set dinners--we ordered (2) sets and they both had to be prepared as medium.  

We asked why, and the reason basically came down to \"because\".

Bread was cold, balsamic vinaigrette was weird.  I usually love balsamic, but it tasted stale.

Creamy Seafood Pasta tastes like canned cream of mushroom + pasta.  The seafood they put in the pasta is good though.  I just wish the the sauce wasn't so bland.

Steak was cooked nicely.  Medium was still very juicy.  The sides were good, lots of mash and veges which I liked.  Only thing is I wished they either did mash, or baked potatoes, and not some weird hybrid of the two.

The fish was covered in the same sauce as the pasta.  Tasted neither good or bad.

Dessert was good.
Drinks were good.  
Service was good.

Like the other reviewers said; be aware that there are a lot of little rules and service charges if you inconvenience their establishment.  Read them on the post here before deciding to go."}
{"text":"OMG is a very good choice for lunch as their price is very similar to other HK Cafe in the area.  However, if you do decide to come here for dinner, be prepared to spend around $20 per person at least for very typical food.

I come to OMG mainly for lunch, because of their wide selection of choices on the menu, at around $9 per person, you have bread and soup to start, your choice of the main course and a drink.  Their food is properly the prettiest when compared to other HK Cafe in the area and they also taste very good.  My personal favorite is the smoked salmon pasta with cream sauce.

If you want a quick decent lunch at a reasonable price range, OMG is a very good option!  Dinner, maybe not so much."}
{"text":"Meh HK spin on western food. The front of their menu has a laundry list of rules such as x% for party sizes, another y% for split checks etc. that leaves a poor first impression. 

The veal curry sauce had a hint of coconut, and the veal itself was tender. The seafood mango spaghetti had a delightful and bright flavor, but the seafood was mushy and not fresh. The waitress recommended a horlick drink that was supposed to be a malt chocolate drink. However, it came out looking like milk, and had lackluster flavor."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a something and didn't have breakfast that day. When I yelped the area, there wasn't any food place in the area that wasn't chinese and I haven't had chinese food before so I wasn't comfortable with exploring with almost painful hunger.

But since I had no option I went to OMG and here is my conclusion:

The environment is not neutral. Why? somebody who came about 10 minutes later than me, came in, gave an envelope to one of the waiters, sat down and got served much before me.

I ordered a portugese styled chicken with Spaghetti, and I actually couldn't have much of it. There wasn't much taste to the food, just roasted chicken with spaghetti and vegetables, I took it home and had it with ketchup.

One big plus, the food is very cheap, A Chinese Tea + food + coffe/hot choclate, all for $8.99

I haven't had much Chinese food so it could just be that my taste buds aren't meant for this cuisine."}
{"text":"Starters, 3 dozen oysters - $1 per oyster. Not too bad but definitely not as fresh as places like Biffs bistro. Then we had the fois gras on crostini.... It tasted of nothing and the fois gras had the texture of an overcooked meat. It was so small and it costed $17.50. What the........... 
We also got soups : lobster bisque, Russian borscht, and cream soup. Everything is way too salty. Lobster bisque was very fishy, not a lot of lobster taste.

We had the 4 person meal - $100 : in my opinion, way too expensive. Had spaghetti with cream sauce with seafood, pork foot, steak with mashed potatoes and fish with vegetables. Quality of everything was OK. Steak was very chewy. We asked for medium but we basically got well done. Then spaghetti was way too salty. 

Service was good but the servers really try to rush to get the plates back. It's great if we have more food coming but if feels like they stand there to get us to finish the dish so that they can use the dish again for other guests....

In a way, I'm being brutally honest with my opinions. Salt is definitely needed to enhance the flavor of the dish, however, too much salt just overpowers the flavors that is put into the dish. 

Would I be back? ..... Only if I need to be."}
{"text":"Came in here with the family on a nice quiet week night. For starters, we got the stale ish bread with butter and balsamic vinegar oil mix. Not much to say about that. Then we got our salty soups. The lobster bisque is terrible. No lobster in it at all! And it is overly salty. 

Next we have our oysters which were pretty good. They open it up and serve, so there really no way to mess that up...  Good batch. Not too skinny :)

They had crackers with fois gras. They were more like quarter sized over done steaks. The meal also came with escargots. These were well seasoned with a bucket of salt. The steak was okay. Juicy but the meat itself had a rougher texture than I would like. Especially for the amount were paying. The fish and pork are fairly bland and the pasta is heavy. Their curry, though, is quite well done. :) 

Service is okay. The staff are impatient when they want to collect plates. They just stand there as you eat and say \"if you just clear that up we can take the plates\". Are you running out of plates in there? Gosh. They did it twice. Trying to take the plates while we're still eating off them. 

Place is well lit without being too bright. Clean environment and comfortable seating. I didnt see the bathrooms so no comments there. 

Over all. It's okay, but definitely over priced. Not worth our hard earned money because they provide little to no value. It would probably get higher ratings if they priced according to what they actually offer. 

Would I return? Not really.. No.."}
{"text":"The food is quite good. BF ordered the steak medium rare and it's surprisingly tender though it didn't appear to be very pink. I ordered the pork chop with shrimp and scallop. There's only one piece of shrimp and one piece of scallop but there were two big pieces of pork chop. They were pretty good but not very special. The price is a little bit pricey and I thought it would be better to include a little dessert such as a jelly or pudding just like other Hk styled western restaurants.  I suspect that there's special offer or coupon as the tables next to us seem to all order the pork chop with foie gras and one dude even said that the foie gras was surprisingly big for its price. The service was good as the staff were all polite."}
{"text":"The price is too expensive for what you get. The bread is stale and not soft. It doesn't even absorb the balsamic that comes with the bread. The so called \"Caesar salad\" uses poor quality vegetables."}
{"text":"OMG is an upscale HK restaurant with plenty of western dish choices.  The quality of food is good, each dish was well made and presented well. I got the curry shrimp which was appropriately spicy with a good kick and crisp jumbo shrimps. It was delicious without being too overpowering. 

My group loved their individual dishes. The salted pork foot was a delightful surprise, the whole table enjoyed the crispy skin and the tender meat. The meat was a little too salty for my taste but the whole dish got licked clean so I assume it was good. For those who don't like such strong flavors, the smoked salmon pasta seemed like a good choice."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and the food is really unique. It's kind of a blend between Western and Chinese (Hong Kong style), which seems fairly common in Markham, but what I like about them is that they seem to do it just right without it coming off as TOO chinese.. if that makes any sense. 
The food is always cooked thoroughly and every dish I've ordered has been pretty tasty. Some of the items on the menu are a little overpriced considering they aren't as upscale as they may think they are, but you do get what you pay for, so the quality is there. I love the way they cook their lamb, and their lobster bisque is delicious. 
The bread you get in the beginning is Chinese style, but they serve it with vinegrette so it's pretty tasty with butter. Most HongKong style cafes just give you microwaved bread with butter.
Anyways this is my favourite Hong-Kong style cafe.. probably because it food tastes more western and the prices are fairly reasonable (at least for the items I get!)."}
{"text":"I put 4 stars, but, I think I would have put 3.75.  Partial stars aren't award-able and I thought ok, benefit of the doubt, it's worth 4.

This place is not so stellar that it'll blow your mind.  It's not going to make you rediscover your love for HK style cafe, but it's well worth your while to try.  I've been here for both lunch, and dinner services, and the best bang for your buck is the lunch menu, without a doubt.  Dinner menu is a bit pricier, and while it's not enough to make you break the bank, and it is better than some of the other HK style cafe offerings that are in competition and considering what is on offer, I think it is worth it.  More on that later.

The lunch menu is cash only if I recall correctly.  Having said that, it's well worth it.  The most popular recently has been their chicken/pork chop with the onion sauce.  The mixed grill is not worth the while, considering it's chicken, lamb chop and a sausage.  What has always been a winner is that their soup doesn't feel like it's a powder mix like most restaurants, plus there's always quite a bit more than just soup.  There's also actual clam when they make clam chowder, and some bits of chicken, carrots.  I know it's not much, but at the very least it's not just soup.  Having said that, the menu is rather diverse, and the offerings are quite decent.  The baked casserole is always a must try, and the curry is always spot on.  Portions aren't tiny either.  If you are afraid you can't finish all the food, bring your own container, they charge an extra 50 cents or so for a container (let's be eco-friendly how about?)

The dining room was never intended to be what it currently is.  I think it was designed to be a lounge, so there are 3 seats that are giant u-shaped booths.  I can't stress enough, how awkward it was at first because those booths were never filled up, so they always asked if people wanted to split the seating in these booths when it got busy during lunch time.  This was how Hong Kong style cafes, restaurants and the like have done it.  Fine, but OMG Restaurant & Lounge doesn't seem to fit well with that act.  I understand that you need to do that to cut down on waiting times, but the \"lounge\" aspect is totally gone.  Again, this was born out of necessity, so I am fine with it, but I know not all people are comfortable with it.  I think this has also been their biggest Achilles' heel this whole time, because they wanted this place to be posh and hip, with their extra room to act as a karaoke room to cater to the more young crowd.  That never really happened, so eventually, they just opened it up for more dining (good luck flagging down the waiter then).  I got this feeling that the colour scheme, the setup and whatnot were geared towards the 20-40 crowd, but I think what they ended up with is the 30-70 crowd as their main clientele.  It's not bad, and I commend them for being able to pick up and run with it.

The dinner, I did want to talk about that.  One time, I had a pretty good ham hock.  I miss that meal actually, because it was amazing.  The other time I went, they did a group dinner combo, and I think it's actually quite good.  It was dinner for 4, and you got steak, pasta, foie gras, mussels, and good helping of vegetables for everyone.  Yes, the food served family style is a bit unusual, but trust me, the chef brought his A-Game.  I think that's been the one thing that's kept these guys in business all these years, is that they've been very consistent.  The food is nothing to write home about, but it is always delicious, and the food is prepared with a level of finesse.  

I don't usually need to write reviews for an establishment that's been around for quite a while, but I saw they're about to do some renovations, and I overheard the owner telling one of his regulars that he's considering pursuing other endeavours, and he might move on from the restaurant.  Part of me wants to ensure he knows he's got fans.  I hope he realizes that Yelp does support his establishment.  

As I'm writing this on my computer, I noticed someone with a less than stellar review say that they \"had a lamp and pasta\", and complained that the pasta was tasteless and the \"Lamp is ok, just tasted like you can buy and cook by yourself from supermarket\".  People don't usually cook \"lamp\".  We usually just plug it in and turn it on to help us see in the dark.  As for the seafood pasta, I've had it (I mean..I did check in 27 times) and I think it's not perfect, but definitely not tasteless.  Perhaps they should stop eating light fixtures and they'll realize what's ruining their taste buds?

So, I implore everyone to go give them a try.  I know my taste is not the same as everyone else's but this place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

I pass this restaurant everyday during my days at Seneca on the Viva bus. I originally thought it was a patio lounge, but eventually I learned from here that it's a HK style cafe restaurant. I figure I'd give this place a try, despite the polarizing reviews.

I ordered the seafood spaghetti with rose sauce. I will say, given the price of this meal ($8.99), I can't really complain too much. It's obviously not the best I've tried, but in other places where I have seafood pasta, it easily eclipses $10. The spaghetti and seafood were actually quite well done, but the rose sauce didn't really have a rose feel as it was too watery.

The iced lemon tea here was below average and I would definitely reconsider from ordering that next time.

Service was excellent and I was treated to the whole way. To be honest, if I was nearby and looking for a HK style cafe place to eat, this is the only option within a 1km radius. I wouldn't downright say no to coming back here."}
{"text":"Was here with a group of 10 friends on Sunday for lunch.  The food is decent for HK cafe style food.  The prices are low so it's good value for money.

However the service staff wasn't very friendly and they will not do individual checks and is a cash only payment system.  Just getting the right amount of change for each person proved to be quite the chore.  Definitely won't be returning with any groups of friends."}
{"text":"Truffle pasta did not have truffle taste. Foie gras was not thoroughly cooked (twice). Nothing here stood out. Got sick from eating here. Will not come back nor recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday with a group and they were out of a lot of items on the menu like steak and Portuguese rice.. 

This place is an HK style restaurant, with decent prices for meals, however there are a lot of extra charges.. like extra bread, takeout bag/containers..

Tip: Cash only for lunch specials

The bacon spinach cream sauce on rice is very bland and non-memorable.. 

Mushroom soup was just that... creamy can soup. 

The shrimp and chicken looked pretty good, but I didn't get to taste it and I hear dinner is better.. 

I've heard dinner is a lot better though with one of the people who came with us in the group so I might just go again to see if I can update his review."}
{"text":"It's \"decent\"... nothing out of the ordinary but nothing terrible either.

Came here for lunch on a Saturday. Place is smaller than I expected, but at least seating wasn't crammed. There was also an extra room in the back. Lunch menu had a number of choices too, so that was relieving. They also have a tea time menu which I realized on my way out. Would've tried that instead.

Service was average for a Chinese restaurant; food came at a decent time and presentation was clean. FYI just because this place is trying to be 'Westernized', don't expect them to let you finish your soup and rolls before they bring out the main course... cuz they won't. At one point I basically had everything on the table and just had to tell them to take it away.

The dish names were fancy... like angel hair pasta with out of the world cream sauce and free run chicken garnished with black forest ham, when in fact it's really white sauce pasta with chicken and ham... they're really the common dishes you can get at any other Chinese restaurants.

Had the escargots as well, and although it was pretty flavourful, it was a bit oily. It would've been better if they had baked mashed potatoes under the escargots to absorb some of the garlic butter, which would've been a better pairing too.
Price I have to say is decent. Dishes weren't overly priced for the amount you get - soup, bread, drink, and a main.

If you're opting to come here, I would suggest coming for dinner as their dinner menu seemed a bit more interesting. All in all, it's a tidy and somewhat comfy place for a bite."}
{"text":"Food is soso, which I am not going to complain about. What turned me off was the way they try to rush you to finish off by cleaning up the table ( even you're not done ), ordering the complimentary drink while you're still in the middle of the main dish...etc.

The worst is that I don't know how they wash the dinnerware, or if they do at all. The coffee cup was simply with a strong smell of saliva when I tried to take a sip, as if it's been used for many times without washing. that's gross enough for me to continue."}
{"text":"O.M.G? Oh My God Restaurant & Lounge? 
O.M.G? Oh Motherfxxking Good? 

Not really... but not bad. 

Chinese owned steakhouse and seafood Restaurant. You can call it Asian Fusion as this is more tailored to the Chinese patrons. 

OMG is surprising small... have room for 30 people or so at one time. For should a small restaurant, there are 6 plasma TVs showing Hong Kong pop singer MTV. The menu has steak, oyster, salmon, lobster and pasta based dishes. There is a Malaysian curry special: 

Malaysian Curry Pork Rib served in a Hot Pot ($12.99) 
- good mix of vegetarians: broccoli, eggplants, red pepper and potato 
- Pork Rib is really tender, though there are not a lot of pieces 
- curry is a really coconut based.. with a kick (turmeric, shallots, ginger, shrimp paste, chili, and garlic)... similar to the version at Phoenix Restaurant but more watery 

and 

Pasta with Tiger Shrimp in Creamy Truffle Sauce ($16.99) 
- OMG this only have 3 shrimps.. :), I can hardly taste the truffle ..but for that price, I don't think i should expect too much? 
- the sauce is quite creamy and made this a fulfilling dish 

All the entrees can be upgraded to includes soup and HK style milk tea/coffee for $3. 

The staffs were wonderful... we were asked a couple of time how I like my curry, was it too spicy? (me? spicy?)..which is not common in most of the Chinese Restaurant I been to! 

So I can conclude that OMG is a Hong Kong Style Western restaurant. I am eyeing their lunch specials from $6.99 that includes soup and tea/coffee! That sounded like my kind of lunch place! LUNCH SPECIALS!!!! 

10% off grand opening specials if you pay cash!"}
{"text":"Starting off we had to wait 20 minutes on a Sunday which was raining for a table. That did not amuse me. Also, the restaurant did not have a lot of decoration. The place was basically painted all black. Then the back wall had their logo. Thats the decoration!! 

Food was okay. Nothing special. My family and I ordered the Grilled Pork Chop, Grilled Chicken and Grilled fish (i forgot the whole real name.. sorry!)  By adding $3 there will be a soup and a coffee/tea. I chose the clam chowder. From experience, I believe the clam chowder would be cream soup with clams and potato. When it came, the bowl was really large BUT it was only like 75% full. The clam chowder consisted of cream sauce, clams, CARROTS and ONIONs. I did not taste potato and it was not rich/ thick. Main course, took a LONG time to come and the quality was not REALLY GOOD.  It was just normal. I expected more as the commercial said from the chef of the Midland Dickins.

Service: Ehhh... Basically only 1 person can truly do stuff. The others seem to be there to serve you but don't do it. For example, I ask them to see why my food was taking sooo long. One waitress went into the kitchen, came back out and said NOTHING to us. Another waitress then told us its coming! 

Overall, this restaurant I will not be returning to. At the price they charge, I do not think it is worth it. If you want to try HK style Western food, try the Phoenix  Restaurant. The food there is priced at a reasonable price with good quality."}
{"text":"O.M.G. Restaurant Lounge... OMG so slow!!!

My mom was intrigued by O.M.G. Restaurant Lounge because she keeps hearing about it in the Chinese ads.  I was quite apprehensive to try a restaurant named O.M.G., but thought I should give it a chance. We were particularly interested in their German pork hocks, but unfortunately, it was sold out. 

I didn't like how the bread was toasted after it was cut, resulting in a hardened surface on every slice. In addition to the usual butter, the bread was also served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. However, it was really difficult to dip the bread into the ramekin. They should've poured it onto a plate. 

If you upgrade your order into meal for $3 (entrée + soup + drink), you can enjoy a buy 1 get 1 offer for their oysters, up to a dozen in total (i.e. you can buy up to 12 for $6). The oysters were surprisingly good- very fresh and sweet. The BOGO offer was definitely a good deal, and I'd come back just for that. 

For our soup, we chose clam chowder over the borscht. It was better than the average Chinese-style clam chowder: creamy and loaded with goodness. At this point of the meal, I was pretty happy with everything. But that was about to change. 

After the soup, we had to wait 40 minutes for our entrées. 40 minutes!! I thought I was going to faint. All around me, I could hear other customers complaining about the slow service. The table next to us got their food around the time when we placed our order, and by the time our entrées arrived, they had finished and left! My boyfriend ordered grilled chicken steak with black pepper sauce, which was actually pretty decent. The chicken was moist and tender, albeit slightly undercooked (we had to ask them to recook a piece more thoroughly, just to be safe). I would've been happy with the dish, had it come in a more timely manner.  

My mom and I shared Malaysian tenderous rib, which arrived bubbling hot. I thought that the curry had good flavours, but was a little watered down. The meat was tender, but the flavour was bland on its own. I had to slather a lot of curry onto each bite. Overall, I liked the chicken a lot more. 

I really had a major issue with the speed of the service. The food was actually better than what I expected, but the wait was just unbearable! I would want to come back to try their pork hocks and order the oysters again, but only if their operating efficiency improves."}
{"text":"We visited for the cheap oysters. 

Personally, I would pay for good oysters and I would pay for good food. The cheap oysters, although a good snack if you're craving the taste, are not fresh. The pasta and steak were just okay. Acceptable... Generous portions because it's Chinese-run! You can always count on that! But I think it's way too expensive for the low quality food.

There are many options and combos. You'll be full, that's for sure.

Service was decent. Acceptable for Chinese restaurants. But it's not even subpar to downtown restaurants with the same price."}
