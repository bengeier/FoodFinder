{"text":"Great menu. Everything I have eaten so far has been great. From sliders to lamb lolipops, pizza, oysters, dumplings etc ... Something for everyone and the bar always has friendly poeple and good music"}
{"text":"Little update - after speaking with my dining companions I discovered that not everyone was as happy as I originally thought, so here are the comments. 

\"...thought the service a little on the slow side , seeing as we were very few customers. Would have liked to see some bread on offer , rather tasty with pasta and moules, although probably better for our figures. Found the place dark and unattractive but then it is meant to be a bar. Would not be tempted to go back.
My meal was just OK.\"

And

\"Thought the resto was nice , good food,
good value. I had the roast beef sandwich, very juicy, not dried out! Would definitely go back! I don't think the server told us her name ! Could it be?\""}
{"text":"La nourriture est très bonne et le bar est efficace. Tout un atmosphère. Dommage que la terrasse donne sur le stationnement. Les hamburgers sont excellent ainsi que les frites maison. Le bar est toujours assez occupé. Possibilité de commander des plats à partager entre amis touts en prenant un verre. Beaucoup de bruit à l intérieur et beaucoup  de réguliers à grande gueule surtout sur la terrasse. Malgré tout c'est un bon endroit si le bruit ne vous dérange pas."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, warm and cosy. The hostess are extremely friendly and helpful.

Tried the calamity, they were perfectly cocked, \"al-dente\". The breading was light but with a slight spicy bite. The duping sauce was awesome with its own kick.

The muscles are also highly recommended with a Spanish twist adding chorizo.

I would definitely  come back for the food.

The only thing they are missing is a dance floor. The music was great and several patrons were dancing in their chairs."}
