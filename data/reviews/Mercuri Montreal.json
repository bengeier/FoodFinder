{"text":"Came here for a birthday lunch with colleagues - good food, service was prompt. All in all a nice experience"}
{"text":"We have been to Mercuri for \"MTL à TABLE\" and we were underwhelmed to say the least. The appetizers were good but it was downhill from there. 38$ for 2 slices of steak, 30$ for 5 raviolis, and their ribs were very rough if you could find the meat at all. My friends told me it was amazing one year ago but it has obviously gone down in quality. We gave our feedback to the waitress but we never heard anything back. A real shame considering the venue is well put together. We will not be back."}
{"text":"29 mai 2014 - serveurs courtois, présentation éloquante des plats. Pas de menthe pour mojito de mon amie, pas d'ananas pour le drink de mon autre amie et moi, ma bière en fût était 'flatte'. Si vous commandez les raviolis en plat principal, je vous recommande de manger beaucoup de pain avant, pendant et après.  Portion minuscule qui ressemble plus à une entrée. Pour 33$, tu as 5 raviolis... oui, oui... 5. très deçu.  J'en ai fait mention au serveur et ce dernier de répondre... \"Oui mais ils sont fait à la main et il y a beaucoup de travail\".  Nous étions un groupe de 11 personnes et 5 ont commnandé les raviolis et même commentaire concernant la portion.  C'est dommage car ils étaient délicieux... peu nombreux... mais délicieux.  70$ pour 1 bière, 1 entrée, 1 plat principale, taxes et pourboire... ça ne vaut pas la peine."}
{"text":"Just placed our order - I won't even wait for the food to say how terrible the service is.  If you are a douche (tasteless or not), you will be right at home!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, and the service is great. I was there for MTLatable, and all the courses were delicious. I'm not usually a big fan of dessert - but the pumpkin spice cake and the chocolate/date cake were to die for!! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Loud Ambiance Good Decor  My second review and not a good one at that. Hype... you not. OK I admit it's got a great looking interior, fire pit and such, but so does any number of places in this city with nicer looking fire pits and cozy ambiance. Don't think you're the only one. After waiting almost an hour for our order, it arrived cold as f#$%. Hot plates, cold food.Maybe it was supposed to be served cold?Who knows?? Two thinly sliced pieces of protein/meat with a medley of vegetables and droplets of sauce......really. Saison you're not!  At these prices one would think otherwise. Complete struggle.... It just wasn't good. The service was god awful and that wasn't even the icing on the cake. Dessert....was  actually the worst of the entire evening let alone the entire meal and vice versa, it really sucked! The flavors and textures were not harmonious, once a dessert is deconstructed you know the chef is cutting corners and being lazy. Something that takes hours in the making ,. caramelization and natural breakdown of pectin and flavors, is magical, That can't be re-created or achieved by deconstructing. I wanted to give it a two star rating, but considering the struggle it took, the long wait and cold food and the prices charged not to forget  the cluster f@#$% of a dessert, that made it a 1 star."}
{"text":"Mon restaurant préféré à Montréal dans cette ligue (côté gastronomique). Contrairement aux autres commentaires, j'ai toujours eu un service exceptionnel. C'est un peu cher, mais honnêtement les saveurs sont au rendez-vous. Belle carte de vin. Un must pour les party de bureau payés par quelqu'un d'autre ou pour sortir son amoureuse."}
{"text":"Service was awful, even if its a nice place, we go out to nice restaurants to eat so i expect to eat well, my meat was cold after an hour of wait. Definitely not worth going back"}
{"text":"Let's start by saying Joe Mercuri is one of the best in town. I have been there for lunch menu and diner, always delicious. The chef made me eat all the things I never liked but as I trust him, I ate and it was delicious. The baby back ribs is a must."}
{"text":"Les côtes levées étaient dures La serveuse peu informée sur le menu Musique trop forte"}
{"text":"The quality of the food is 5/5. DO NOT get it twisted. The actual FOOD I got was very delicious, well presented, well made.  The portions for the price though? OMG. No. I'd rather go to Helena around the corner and get a decently sized appetizer, meal and dessert.  What I got for the $30 I paid in total, was what I expected as the portion size of an appetizer.   We got 3 pieces of bread that were wood fired and slathered in olive oil with some raw garlic rubbed on it, and I am glad I ate 2 of the 3 of them.  The soup was about 5 tablespoons worth (really delicious but .. FIVE TABLESPOONS), and the actual \"meal\" (LOL) itself was a small strip of steak, about the size of two packs of stringable cheese placed together, 5 little leaves of a salad, a tablespoon of sauce (?), and a drizzle of oil.  I got it, and thought: WHERE IS THE REST OF IT?  WHERE IS THE REST OF THE MEAL, MERCURI?  Where is the filler food like the rice pilaf, the roasted potatoes.. something.. ANYTHING.   What a disappointment.   Come and eat here if someone else is picking up the bill, then order TWO appetizers and TWO meals and you might get a decently sized meal."}
{"text":"By best friend and I were visiting Montreal and we randomly walked by this restaurant while staying across the street.  We thought the menu looked nice and decided to reserve spots for dinner.  We did the 5 course tasting menu which is very reasonably priced, however it doesn't include a wine pairing which, with the help from my wonderful waitress Mylene we picked out some wonderful glasses to pair with the dishes.  More on her excellent service later....   The tasting menu changes but our started with the lobster salad style dish with great mango puree/sauce dotted around it.  Then the appetizer trio which consisted of three of the claims; beef tartare; and the wonderful truffle dumpling on a bed of some sort of beans which I'm usually not a fan of but I ate every last bean because the sauce was wonderful.  The next plate was one piece of their black ash mushroom ravioli and I wish I had more of that!  The main dish is one that gets split between two people and we had a choice between the fish or the meat plate which consisted of the ribs and striploin.  We chose the meat and couldn't finish it but it was divine and perfectly cooked plus it came with a small side of broccoli salad.   The ending was a nice light dessert which we both chose the chocolate option.    Now to the service.  Our waitress was Mylene who made us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant.  She was so helpful and knowledgeable in helping me choose each glass of wine for the courses and when I had already picked the glass a head of the time for the meat course she had it sitting in front of me right after I finished the current glass I had, long before I could even ask for it.  She also provided me with tastings when I couldn't decide which wine to choose.  Really I was so extremely impressed with her service.  Especially since my time in Montreal was met with horrible service every place I went except for Mercuri.  The restaurant seemed very focused on service because other waiters would also stop by randomly just to make sure all was good.  I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Never coming back here. Service was terrible - took 45 minutes to get our first drinks. No one offered us menus. Food took forever. We ordered a round of premium vodka shots and it was clear to us they gave us a cheaper brand but charged us for the top shelf stuff. Had to point it out to get the bill adjusted. Spent $130/ couple and left hungry. This place is new so perhaps they will iron out some of these issues but we left feeling taken and will never return."}
{"text":"This venue is an all time recommendation from friends I have never tried out, being a local I was so happy to have sampled their menu during mtl a table.  For 41$ I sampled a beef tartar (so good!), ribs with a side of kale Parmesan salad and grilled potatoes. (More than filling) Dessert included a milfeuille- fig ice cream - grilled apple combo ( sort of dry- would've enjoyed more ice cream for an apple crumble pie feel)   I definitely got over my money's worth! Except for the service :( the server felt rushed."}
{"text":"Un peu cher mais j'ai bien aimé l'expérience.  Mon plat de raviole de cendres de poireaux, céleri rave, shiitake et pancetta et cheddar valaient la peine.  Dessert original et délicieux: crème glacée au chocolat, crème d'arachide et panko au cacao"}
{"text":"Vraiment dispendieux pour les portions. L'entrée de thon était bonne, mais ridiculement chère pour les trois petits morceaux. Le peu de viande qu'il y avait sur nos côtes levées était difficilement mangeable. Un contre-filet à 38$ : deux morceaux qui entrent dans le creux de la main...  Nous étions six, nous nous sommes plaints pour le contenu de nos assiettes et la qualité de notre nourriture. Personne de la direction n'est venu nous voir pour améliorer notre expérience. J'ai travaillé en restauration et je trouve cela inacceptable. Une des pires expériences à vie dans un resto. Seul point positif : nos verres de vin étaient remplis régulièrement et nous n'avons pas manqué d'eau non plus."}
{"text":"Souper arrive 2h20 après avoir commandé, tiède, attitude de la serveuse et du gérant et aucune accommodation.  Merci mais non merci."}
{"text":"L'entré de Tartares est le meilleur Tartare de ma vie et j'aime les tartares. Trois Tartare dans une phrase, c'est un gros indice :-)."}
{"text":"Awesome Awesome Place,Good Food,Fantastic Service. The Staff Are Friendly But it's  expensive $$$$$ get your Credit Card Ready When you Go :) But It's Worth  a Try"}
{"text":"Traveling in Montreal we decided to eat at Mercuri on the advice form a friend.  We are so glad we took their advice.  We started with a bar at the drink to soak up the atmosphere.  The bartender was extremely friendly, she made several suggestions to my dinner date and whisked our drinks out in minutes.  We then moved on to dinner and what a dinner it was!!  We started with some fresh scallops and tuna tar tar, both excellent and delivered by none other than the owner and chef Joe Mercuri.  He asked about our food preference and then proceeded to bring us small plates of slow cooked ribs (the best I have ever had), tender veal bites delectable Korean sauce beef of some kind.  Incredible!  We followed this with a chocolate tart and Mercuri bars (chocolate with pretzels and caramel).  If you are in Montreal don't miss this experience!  Staff was great and the ambience was excellent!"}
{"text":"We went for MtlATable, Montreal Restaurant Week.  The food was wonderful.  The dumplings in particular were exquisite - they serve those in heaven.  Service was efficient and friendly.  Unfortunately, the atmosphere was like a club.  Dance music was so loud that my wife and I had a hard time hearing each other.  The room was so dark that it was hard to see my food."}
{"text":"Extremely underwhelming...Cool to sit in the same (casual room) room as the fire pit but too pricey for what they are serving. Very small portions. Better places in the city to spend $150 (2 people). Sorry..."}
{"text":"Had supper with a couple of friends. We sat in the finer dining side. There is also a casual dining side which I haven't tried. We ordered several apetizers and a main course. Pricing and minute portions aside, this restaurant is probably serving up some of the most trendy and savoury dishes in Montreal atm. Every dish was better than the previous, only wish I had another bite. Impecable decor and service make it a night to remember. Kudos to the owners and the chefs. Now one more spoon please."}
{"text":"Mercuri was delicious! Every single dish ordered was great. Know that this restaurant is a $$$$ one and while portions are small, we were satisfied at the end of dinner. The dumplings are amazing and a classic and the desserts are gorgeous and so good. Staff was doing a great job explaining the dishes and making sure our glasses were full. We had a great experience!"}
{"text":"Wood oven The Mercuri has a wood oven which is great! We had great food and very professional service. However, I tough it was too expensive. Even the sparkling water was not cheap."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Chef is extremely creative with local fare. Ribs and Ravioli rocked. Excellent salad with veggies charred.  I will be back! Great wine offering too - not crazy expensive and pairs well with the meal."}
{"text":"I have been to many places and high end restaurants, but Joe Mercury is one of the best and most creative chefs I have ever seen! He's an artist! He plays with the foods to get different textures and tastes that will blow your mind away! Crazy good, yes it is pricey but you should know before going to such places what to expect. For me the $ is 100% worth it!"}
{"text":"Soyons honnête et constructif; Ayant hâte de découvrir la nouvelle enseigne du flamboyant Mr Mercuri... Je dois avouer que nous avons été déçu par l'expérience.   La première déception a été de voir que le menu ne  se compose que de 4 plats principaux... Sur 10 items au au total... Entrées et desserts compris.   On se sent donc vite obliger(voir imposé par le personnel) de se laisser aller avec la formule découverte a 65$ sans savoir vraiment ce qui nous attends... C est a la discrétion du chef et de son inspiration creative du moment nous dis t'ont...   Et ne tentez pas de faire changer quoi que ce soit a la formule... Mr Mercuri n'aime pas ca(diva en plus?) , le personnel vous enfourche quasiment une fourchette de pieuvre dans le fond de la gorge même si vous n'en manger pas,  en prétextant que c'est une création de Joe Mercuri et que vous allez l'aimer!   S'ensuit la découverte du soi dit menu... 5 services.    Ce que le menu ne dit pas..  C est que chaque assiette semble destiné à un nain anorexique! Du moins c'est l'impression laissée lorsque chaque assiette semble aussi grosse que la roue d'un SUV et ou 3petits morceaux de thon façon sashimi se courent après...   Que dire du plat principal... 3 tagliatelle enroulée et 1 morceau de lapin aussi gros qu'un champignon....   Il y a eu quelques expériences agréables,  notamment un oeuf cuit a 75degrés dans une sauce aux truffes incroyable...   Le tout... Pour la modique somme de 350$ pour 3 personnes... Cher pour un menu tapas!   Quant au service... Coincé se donnant une attitude guindée pas forcément nécessaire, faisant même quelques faux pas;  chemise qui déborde du jeans, serveur sorti tout droit d'une agence de sécurité (ou agent de la CIA sous couverture) , arrogance de certains,  presentation des tables douteuses (mettre un tapis a égoutter la vaisselle noir du wallmart sur les tables en guise de déco... NON)   Je me suis permis de faire part de mes commentaires au maitre d'hôtel qui a fais son possible pour nous accommoder.   Dans l'ensemble,  quelques combinaison de gouts intéressants mais pas de la a se jeter par terre sur ces soit dit creations.   (Sans commentaire sur le spaghetti gelo au soja accompagnant le sashimi...)   Je precise que je ne suis affilier a aucun établissements et que je n ai aucune frustration a passer sur le dos de ce resto..on ne s'attendait pas a un festin de buffet chinois.. Mais quelque chose d'un peu plus consistant...   Je donnerai sans doute une 2eme chance a cet établissement dans quelques mois... Cependant je le déconseille dans l'immédiat... Ca manque de fini, surtout dans cette gamme de prix!   Mais aux dire du serveur... Mr. Mercuri ne croit pas a ce genre de formule.... Dommage!"}
{"text":"Yumbo. Delicious food. In house pastry chef. I all amazing. Truffle dumplings are the best."}
{"text":"Bon rapport qualité-prix pour le service du midi. Le tartare de gravlax de saumon est excellent, les pâtes au homard aussi. C'est un restaurant un peu cher mais pour fêter la fête d'un collègue et sortir des soupes / sandwiches qu'il y a autour c'est intéressant. Il y a une cheminée active l'hiver mais pour l'été s'est plus de la décoration. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Montreal was spectacular. Our group of 8, 9 with Vito, was a first class experience. Fine Italian cooking is certainly in the Chef's blood. The food was first class delicious, full of flavor, and full of creativity. Our group was welcomed graciously by Vito, Chef Diva Joe, and of course Alfie. We were treated like Kings and Queens and highly genuinely entertained. The service was very personal and attentive. The decor was just beautiful, however still trying to figure out the deal with the couch in the men's room... We even had Vito order our food.  Our smorgasbord could not be topped, even at some other well known Montreal hotspots. The prices were reasonable and the quality was magnificent ! We cannot wait to return to Montreal and visit Mercuri!"}
