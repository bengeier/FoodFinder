{"text":"chicken is good, i like the power flock and frenchie flock.  service is slow, it's like they can't properly manage the flow of orders.  the handful of times I have ordered there, it has taken at least 10 min wait (and not during prime lunch or dinner time). i'm not ordering something very complicated - a bowl that is an assembly of salad ingredients, a dressing from a squeeze bottle and pieces of chicken on top.  paying $17-18 for a chicken salad, and having to wait that long isn't what I consider good value. it's tasty enough that I won't write them off, but I won't be ordering it often, and will try calling ahead to reduce my wait time, hopefully they will be able to work out some of the timing on the orders."}
{"text":"Service is not that good. Food is very tasty and healthy and served quick.  Unique sides too.  Very reasonably priced as well.  Recommend this place just don't expect good service."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! I came here on a Saturday afternoon and ordered the Power Flock bowl, with the addition of chicken. I got the full size, but now know that I could get by with the half size!! It was so full of goji berries, edamame, mandarin oranges, squash, etc etc etc. Honestly, I am still dreaming about this salad and can't wait to go back and get another.  What I really love about this place is that it's somewhere I could bring my boyfriend (a non-salad eating, meat LOVER) and we would both be able to get something to suit our tastes.  Finally, I decided to stay and eat my bowl at Flock and the staff were so kind- they came out from behind the counter and asked me how everything was. I've never been to another \"fast food\" place that has done this.   Good job Flock, see you soon! :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the pulled chicken sandwich:  Chicken was well cooked, not too marinated but was certainly high grade, so tasted good regardless  Bun was your standard gourmet sandwich kaiser  Avocado is in spread form if you're wondering, freshly mashed  I personally enjoyed the horse radish kick, friend would like to see their take on a tangier sauce.  Side note: even street meat vendors have cups of water available for their patrons. get your act together, not everyone wants a 3 dollar root beer with their meal"}
{"text":"I'm always amazed at what people will deem as great food.Grabbed lunch here today. First time and last time.  I ordered the 'frenchy flock' greens and hands down, the worst salad I have ever had. They claim the cauliflower is roasted, which I highly doubt. The green beans are 'vine beans' don't you know, and I'd like to know what vine these came from- they're not quite green, in fact they're almost brown and the texture is like rubber and plastic. The zucchini has been cut erratically and is more reminiscent of scraps.  I also ordered a chicken breast on the side with the Caribbean hot sauce. Nothing great here folks. Although, I did find the sauce very good.  It's pricey here- a whopping $21 for my small order and frankly, you're not getting the value for your dollar."}
{"text":"So happy! This is my new go-to place for lunch!  Best salad and chicken! I normally don't like raw kale, but damn, their Boho salad + chicken bowl is best thing ever. Super fresh and tasty! I bought a whole chicken for dinner and it was so moist and flavourful. I don't know what rub they used for the chicken, but I love it :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful new addition to the neighbourhood, which previously had little in the way of roast chicken outside Chinatown -- this area Grange Park/Chinatown/Entertainment District is one of the few 'hoods in Toronto with no local Portuguese chicken place.  Unlike many of the reviewers, we don't come for lunch; this is dinner on nights when we don't want to cook -- sometimes even twice a week. We usually do the take-home special -- a whole chicken and either two sides, or now that it is summer a salad plus a side.  The chicken is superb -- perfectly cooked and wonderfully juicy; the sauces (we usually get one of each), beautiful, tasty, vaguely South Asian, a nice change from piri peri sauce. The sides are excellent: the beets and brussels sprouts side is an especially nice combination, and the sweet potatoes are a welcome change after years of the little round roasted white potatoes served with Portuguese chicken.  We haven't anything but great take-home meals from Flock!"}
{"text":"I'm upgrading the rating because management made it up to me.  They gave me another whole chicken to replace the cut up chicken that broke through the bag.  They even threw in a complimentary Kale and beet salad and side sweet potato.  The Kale and beet salad is fantastic.  I would definitely buy it."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks after work. Also unlike the other places on this strip they open at 11am n stay open so you could get a bit of a head start on happy hour if you wanted ! =).  Haven't tried their ears but that's next on the list!"}
{"text":"Hard to understand a place whose tagline is \"Delicious food that's pretty good for you\" when they don't make an effort to post nutritional info.  Hey restaurants! We want to know the deets of your food, particularly if you're making health claims!"}
{"text":"I visited Flock today for lunch, and while the salad was pretty decent and I didn't have to wait very long, the value was abhorrent. Paying in excess of $17 for a fast food salad is simply unacceptable. Unless you're involved in a Brewster's Millions' type of contest, there are much better places to spend your money."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner.  I had a half chicken with chimmy churri snd sweet potatoes.    Chicken was tasty, moist and a good size.  Definitely good quality chicken.    Sweet potatoes were good,  but not special.     Will try salads next time, they sounded very creative."}
{"text":"Just had the mixed greens and pulled chicken salad w/ coconut cashew lime and jalape√±o dressing!  Amazing fresh clean taste and texture! Definitely back soon to try some other flavour combinations.  Staff was friendly and gave some awesome suggestions.  Nice open space with good seating to enjoy the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"My girlfriend I and shared the Boho bowl and added Chicken and Avocado. The full price was 19 bucks and change, with no drink.  We were very disappointed with the food.   For 20 dollars I expect fresh ingredients, nuanced flavours and generous portions.  There are several things they are doing wrong with this particular dish. The dressing, is too watery and so does not cling to the salad ingredients, there is also too little dressing so it does not coat the kale at the bottom of the bowl.  The fridges in which they are storing the shredded beat, quinoa, kale and other ingredients is too cold, and the ingredients are not fresh enough. That means they are cold in the bowl, slightly slimy and dull in flavour.  Similarly the chicken used as an add-on for the salads, is clearly day-old chicken that they strip off their unsold rotisserie chickens from the day before. It is unflavourful and classless. It feels like microwaved left over turkey from your weird neighbour.  It's hard for any salad to live up to a 20 dollar price tag, but it was clear with the gaggle of clueless staff, and cumbersome managers tripping over managers, that their inflated prices pays for an unoptimized work force and a flashy high ticket storefront space. I would like to see workers preparing fresh ingredients behind the counter rather than standing idly watching their managers hectically prepare 10 bowls at once.  The obnoxious social media smarts of these restaurant owners far outstrips their understanding of flavours, freshness, and value. The restaurant is housed in a pleasant glass cube in the Entertainment district, but certain small essentials have been overlooked. Salt and Pepper in little paper packages, NO HOT SAUCE, insufficient seating, cumbersome paper plates stored in the dining area disrupting the visual harmony.  We DID share a bowl, but both found ourselves hungrier when we were finished than when we had began.   I am still eager to try their whole rotisserie chicken, but I do not recommend their overpriced, underwhelming salads.  Overall Flock's amateurish approach to soulless food leaves me hungry, offended and poor."}
{"text":"Bought the half Chicken with Roasted Sweet Potato. The skin tasted good, flavorful but the meat is blant also you can still see red-ish / bloody parts which im not comfortable eating. Will i go back? No. Will i crave for it? No."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am not typically one to go for the healthy option among a sea of options. However, Flock is fantastic for those \"detox\" dates on which I want to eat healthy, but I also want something delicious and filling at the same time. I work right by the Chickery and when Flock opened, I assumed it was going to be more or less the same thing. Boy, was I wrong! The salads here are PACKED, fresh, delicious and SO filling, they make you almost forget that you're having a salad in the first place.  I typically go for the Frenchy Flock because I absolutely LOVE cauliflower and I get the half portion with additional chicken and avocado. This only comes out to around $14 and can satiate me for two meals. Their rotisserie chicken is A+; just the perfect amount of moistness with a light hint of their marinade. Usually, if I am unable to finish the salad, I pour the remains into whatever soup I am cooking and you'd be surprised, it actually makes it really really good.   Don't be fooled by what looks like a small portion. It's worth it and unlike other salads, will keep you just the right amount of full."}
{"text":"When was the last time you had to pay for an extra dressing ??! Are you kidding me .. ! Yes that's what happened when I asked for it ..  I mean it's 2017!  Sorry but no thanks!!!"}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto on a quick weekend trip, we found the Flock on here and followed the reviews.  Wife was looking for something different.  We found it at the Flock.  This place is amazing.  I had Pulled Rotisserie Chicken Sandwich with the Flock Stock Soup.  My wife got the BOHO Flock salad with chicken.  We liked it so much we came back the 2nd day."}
{"text":"I love this flock location. It's bright, clean and the staff are friendly. The salads are amazing. I got the fancy flock here and it was delicious. It's the perfect size salad and taste better than freshii."}
{"text":"Lunch time in the entertainment district - first time there, went looking to try a chicken sandwich. Was literally in and out in 30 seconds. Ordered a chicken sandwich, $9.05, was immediately handed a tiny box that materialized out of thin air. Seriously. I blinked, and the cashier handed me this tiny box with the sandwich inside. Expected: large, warm, plump sandwich. Actual: refrigerator cold sandwich with bits of shredded chicken. Nothing special, no taste. Overpriced for what you get.  Probably won't be going back (price vs portion). Chicken should have been warmed up."}
{"text":"Trendy atmosphere, perfect location (close to my work), great service! I had the boho flock (half size), it was fantastic. It's refreshing to have a great place to get a salad for lunch that's filled with good nutrients and interesting choice of ingredients that work. Far from boring! Decent price for a half salad and I added chicken."}
{"text":"It was disappointing.  I ordered the sandwich and it was cold and dry.  When I told the staff that they were indifferent."}
{"text":"Salads were awesome! Stopped here with girlfriends to grab takeout on our way back to our hotel. Very quick service. Great selection of interesting ingredients. Exactly what we needed after a fun and long day of shopping! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Finally two great things come together: delicious salads + chicken (+a delicious chicken sandwich).  Think of the best salads from Fresh, multiply by 2 and add chicken.   The sandwich on a perfect milk bun is also near perfection - the avocado, onion bits and horseradish are a fantastic combo. My only warning is that after a few quick minutes the lower bun of the sandwich got quite mushy (from the horseradish) so perhaps re-ordering toppings is a good idea.  Bottom line: There should be a Flock always within walking distance of you.   Chickens also available ($17.50 for a whole one)."}
{"text":"Super tasty. I've never enjoyed such fun salads before?? Very filling even without meat.  Lots of flavour and texture."}
{"text":"Ordered a full chicken for takeout and didn't even get the two sauces that came with it.  Maybe it was 7:15pm, but the chicken was dry and not worth $18 +tax.  I tried to contact them but was ignored!"}
{"text":"Fresh veggies, quality chicken, yummy dressing - the Boho never disappoints. Great for a healthy, filling lunch. A bit on the expensive side but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Food: 8.5/10 Atmosphere: 8/10  Service: N/A Overall experience: 8.5/10  Grabbed takeout from Flock last week and would highly recommend. For two people, we ordered a whole chicken (with the Caribbean pepper sauce) and the Boho Flock salad (large).   The chicken was hot and moist, even after a fair walk back home. The salad was particularly scrumptious, I really enjoyed the surprise bursts of pomegranate and dried currant in it.   THE BOTTOM LINE: it's not anything fancy, but it's really good."}
{"text":"I think I have an addiction.   I can't speak for the other items on their menu, but the Power Flock salad has me coming back here.  Usually I order on Ritual so I can skip the line up. The only complaint I have is that its difficult to mix the salad. I requested it to be well mixed one time, and they use a bigger bowl and it was perfect!   Want a quick and healthy meal? This is the place!"}
{"text":"Let's be real here guys.   Their salads are good but this place is pretty overpriced. However, if you don't care about money and want a quick healthy meal, then this is not a bad choice.   $2 for adding HALF an avocado and $4 for ONE tablespoon of chicken slices LOL. That's pretty ridiculous. At least put two tablespoons if you're going to charge insurmountable amount of $. Also, there are moments where their chicken is not fresh. I once paid $4 for tiny chicken slices and it smelled so bad that I had to eat it with my nostrils closed simply b/c I couldn't let my $4 go down the drain. Thankfully, I didn't have any food poisoning but it was so not fresh that I wanted to tell them to eat it instead. Too bad I was at home and couldn't do it.  Let me give you some tips. Go buy a whole fully-cooked chicken. Bring it home, pull out the meats yourself, put it in a plastic container and store in your fridge/freezer. Go grocery and buy avocados. ONE ORGANIC avocado costs around the same as their HALF avocado.   Buy a salad here, go home and put them on top of it. You will save $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ with much more nutrition."}
{"text":"I came here for a take-out lunch with a couple coworkers and we made sure to get there before the lunch rush as rumour had it there was quite the line around noon the week before. We got there and there was no line at all. It did take us some time to decide what we wanted as each of their salads have quite a few components to them. I finally decided on the Boho salad and got the small size, adding chicken and avocado. That was more than filling and the chicken was delicious. By adding chicken and avocado my salad cost me about $11, which i think is fair seeing how substantial it was. I wouldn't recommend the larger portion unless you plan on saving some for later. Service was a little slow, but the space was bright and clean and a nice option for a healthy lunch."}
{"text":"While Flock offers a multitude of salads to serve as a bed for your proteins, the focus here seems to be on the rotisserie-style chicken.  As it should, in my opinion, if they're going to name the entire place suggestive of our feathered friends.  Our delicious, juicy friends.    I ordered a chicken leg on a side of chilli lime sweet potatoes.  The chicken, maybe on account of being free-range & antibiotic-free, is a tad on the smaller side.  Nonetheless, it does taste better and more \"chicken flavoured\" than the typical rotisserie chicken from a certain chicken chain's double-leg dinner combo. Ahem, you know...*that* one?   If you're like me and actually still enjoy your chicken with sauce, fret not - Flock offers their own options.  Either a bright chimichurri or Carribean side sauce accompanies your chicken. Both are flavourful and compliment the chicken nicely, with the Caribbean sauce reminding me of a mild jerk sauce.   The sweet potatoes delivered on the chilli lime flavour.  They're soft all the way through.  Some places feature the fact that the meats & produce are organic, locally-grown, etc. without a real consideration of how everything tastes together.  I appreciate that at Flock, the focus is on taste where the food also happens to be well-sourced."}
{"text":"I'm so torn about how to feel about my Flock experience.   On the positive side, I got the Boho Salad with chicken and it was delicious. Really filling and a decently healthy option. It's nice to have dishes like this available to-go in the area.   On the not-so-positive side, the service here wasn't very good. I was with a friend, and ordered 2 salads (one for me and my roommate, who was at home). I understand how the woman behind the cash assumed I had ordered for the friend I was with, but she didn't ask. After I walked away from the cash and my friend stayed, obviously waiting to order her own order, the woman working blatantly ignored her. And after 5 minutes when my friend finally got her attention and said she was in fact ordering for herself, the employee was VERY short and rude. I noticed her being monotone and sassy with all customers-- as if us ordering was an inconvenience. Bad day or not, if you're in that role just put on a smile and keep in mind you're a new restaurant and making a first impression to many customers.  Aside from this, prep was just slow for all the food. All they had to do was put my salad together and toss on some already prepped chicken, and it took 15 min. Between mine and my friend's order, we were in Flock for over 30 min.   All in all, I get the trendy concept and it has the potential to be a successful place-- it comes from owners with a lot of restaurant experience-- but if you want to succeed in such a prime area downtown with high volume, make sure you're organized and get a system down with the staff."}
{"text":"Holy Flock.   This place just opened in the new condo building at Peter and Adelaide Street, right next to the also new, also wonderful Starbucks.   I've heard great things and they have VERY healthy salad options, so I figured why not try it out. I was not disappointed. The staff were super friendly and knowledgable, the place was very clean, and the ingredient are unbelievably fresh.   I had the Power Flock salad to go. It's loaded with ultra healthy ingredient and the best part is - it has flavour. Often times when you get really healthy salads you are sacrificing taste. Certainly not the case here. Their in house white miso dressing is light and Delish.   Gotta say I'm very pleased with my experience here and hopefully they keep up the great work. Definitely will be back soon and often.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A really cool concept- love the combo of a rotisserie and salad shop. Went there for late lunch on a Friday. The store wasn't too busy which was good. We got the harvest bowls - pictured is a half size without chicken and a full size with chicken.  Loved the contents but it was a bit pricey for what it was - $10 for the half size without chicken. The chicken was also a little dry .. maybe just because of the time of day we came?"}
{"text":"No good. $13 for the vegan soup - inedible. Very acidic, not sure if it is too much lime or lemongrass. Had to throw out half of it. Probably should stick with the chicken."}
{"text":"My go to item is the boho salad- I usually get the larger size with chicken.  The best part is the pomegranate seeds and beets!!  It is a little pricey, 17 dollars after tax I think.  Service is quick and never had any issues ordering via ritual app."}
{"text":"Tried there Roast Chicken Sandwich, wanted it with the roasted sweet potatoes but they had ran out so opted for the green beans with kimchi.  The sandwich was decent, although got messy with the slaw and what not falling out. Definitely filling but not my idea of a roast chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Flock is one of my the top go to's for lunch. I've tried a couple of salad options but my #1 choice is the harvest.   $4 for the amount of tuna you get is a joke tho. Save that money for the chicken option or be like me - On days when I know I'll be ordering from flock I bring in my own can of tuna. Lol"}
{"text":"Fresh salads with nicely seasoned chicken- a great lunch option for when I want to eat healthy! However it is pricy so I can't get it everyday. A half salad with chicken comes up to $13.50 after tax. This is not sustainable for my wallet to come here every day, only once in a while."}
{"text":"I don't know.. I went to the Harbord location recently and ordered one of the salads. It sounded pretty good in theory but after a few bites i really felt like i was just eating some corner store bought salad ingredients in a bowl. I added a hardboiled egg to it which made it slightly more exciting but not much could save this salad for me. I think the thing that made it especially dull was the fact that all the vegetables in it were completely raw, so chewing on the heaps of napa cabbage in there got pretty tiresome really quickly. There was a noticeable lack of dressing as well, I noticed this as soon as the salad was brought to me - I'm not someone who loads my salad up with dressing or something but the lackluster drizzle of forgettable dressing was maybe enough to satisfy 10% of the salad in that bowl (c'mon!)   I regrettably did not even try the chicken so I'm judging on the salad alone. The staff was friendly enough perhaps even too friendly for my taste. The interior of this place seems a bit confusing to me - They have retro style booths that remind me of 50's diners but then the rest of the place is a mix between reclaimed wood tables, hanging edison lightbulb fixtures, etc. - seemed a bit jumbled in my opinion.  So yeah, 2/5, this was a boring restaurant with an extremely boring 15 dollar salad. However I can not speak for the original location since some of the pictures posted do look much more delicious than what I was served."}
{"text":"Would I have my friends flocking to Flock? Only if they don't feel like waiting in line at Khao San Road. I heard interesting things about this place so I decided to check it out.  High ceilings and limited bar stool counter tops discourage people from lounging but this place is more of a quick take out place anyways. I tried the pulled chicken sandwich and sweet potato sides and was shocked at how small it was. The chicken was juicy, the ingredients were fresh, but it was just tiny. If you're in the mood for $7 chicken slider then this place is a good bet. It's strength is its health/fresh focus and excellent location (near a gym) but if you're hungry, best to migrate somewhere else."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my meal here today! Only thing that could be improved was that the chicken breast could have been served hotter. I had it with green beans- delicious and I loved the kimchi with the beans. Next time I want to try a salad with chicken."}
{"text":"I had half a chicken with the sweet potato sides. I like the packaging of the food when it's delivered. Almost looks like it could go on a Best Buy shelf!  The Lime salt flavour was not overdone, which was good. The pepper sauce didn't really add much flavour to the chicken. I felt satisfied but I wouldn't rave about the place. Next time I'm trying the salad!"}
{"text":"i got a chicken leg with a side of brussels sprouts and beets.  The chicken leg was juicy and moist but a little on the plain side (chicken is plain in general so IMO it needs to be dressed up a little more). The chimichurri sauce I got it with was ok but forgettable (probably should've gotten the Caribbean one instead). The brussel sprouts and beets though were cooked far too long for my taste as they were almost mushy and could've used a bit more bite to them. The crispy shallots/onions were a nice touch though and added some much needed texture to the entire dish.  Everything was acceptable but nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Sandwich comes with a very underwhelming bun and a tiny portion of dry chicken. Don't even think about trying to switch the bun for something hearty and with flavour - they have no other options for you.  Sweet potatoes are fine but I mean.... I can make those blindfolded.   To top it off, line is super long at lunch and everything is wayyyy overpriced."}
{"text":"I kept hearing such good things about this place from my friends so naturally I had to see what all the buzz was about. Super pleased I went here today!! I got the pulled chicken sammy and the sweet potatoes.  Honestly- at first I though it was too expensive ( $14 with tax) for a quick lunch but it was SO worth the money.The portions were a perfect size too! I went at lunch time and I was worried it would take long but I ordered my food and only had to wait about 3-5 min even though the place was packed.  The food itself was really tasty- The chicken was moist and the toppings on the sammy were all fresh and OH MAN that bun-- I can honestly say it was some of the best bread I have ever had.   Over all I am super happy I went and I will be back for a salad bowl next.  Now go on and flock to flock! ( sorry I had to)"}
{"text":"I had the salad with chicken and it was decent. They charge separately for the chicken so it ends up being around 15 irc. I didn't like the soup though, way too oily. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"The first time I noticed this place was because of the amazing smell of roast chicken wafting out into the street. I was shocked I'd never seen it, and was told it's actually brand new.  Finally got the chance to try it out on a Friday lunch break, was surprised to find the place essentially empty at 1pm. I thought, maybe I'm lucky and I'm in between the noon and late lunch crowd! The menu is simple, various rotisserie chicken portions with side options, various salad bowls in half and full size, and a chicken sandwich with side options. The prices were shocking, but I was hopeful that it'd be worth it.  My boho \"flock\" salad bowl had kale, pumpkin seeds, pomegranate seeds, quinoa, red beets, carrot, cabbage, raspberry dressing...maybe another item or two. I added chicken for $4 to my $8 salad bowl, thinking hey, the place is called Flock, I must try their chicken! The girl behind the bar packed the bowl tight, but the bowl is pretty small from the looks of it. The top circumference is about the size of a CD and it was about 4-5 inches deep, so use your imagination. By the time I got back to the office (1min walk) my chicken was cold, but I didn't mind much as it's a cold salad anyway.  The takeout carton bowl makes it tough to mix things around, and shaking it was pointless because things were packed in tight layers. The combination of toppings was interesting in taste and texture, and I didn't have much to complain about. The chicken was shredded white meat, so it was a bit dry. The portion was filling enough for lunch, but nothing about the taste had me writing home.  For the price of $13 after tax, I thought the bowl wasn't worth my money at all. The portion is on the small side, nothing in the bowl was unique, the chicken was dry...the only thing that cost a premium was the free range chicken...but when it's shredded up like that it didn't make a difference in taste, but I guess one can eat feeling better that the chickens weren't horribly cooped up waiting to be eaten...Lola's Kitchen just down the street offers much larger portions at a comparable price, so please go there instead."}
{"text":"This street seems to be the go to spot for new restaurants as I pretty much spot a new one every visit.  This place was intriguing as hardly anyone does rotisserie chicken right (read always overcooked and loaded with sodium). However this place neither vowed nor disappointed. They do use naturally raised hormone free chicken which is a plus if you are into health food. The place had a steady flow of customers when my DC and I showed up. They had a promo of 2 half chicken and salad + side so instead of ordering a whole chicken we went for that. The size of the chicken is not bigger than the one's offered at grocery stores (definitely smaller than the CostCo version) It is not loaded with sodium thankfully. The white meat was overcooked though. Chimichuri is not my fav sauce to begin with I did enjoy the house pepper sauce. The salad will please the healthy eaters for sure as there were a lot of ingredients in there. Sweet potato side was decent as well. Overall I can't rate it above Nandos. This place will be handy if you want to grab and go something fast as the dinning space inside isn't very inviting.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Meh, chicken sandwich is decent but a bit pricey for me. A salads got made just before my order, half a fresh cut avocado went on it. I thought my sandwich my get fresh slices, but instead he scraped a bin to get some nice and a brown mashed avocado to smear on the bun. Yum.  Then I watched several bad food service habits. Taking cash with gloves, serving with and without gloves... another fellow popped the oven open and ate a piece of something--gloves on--right in front of us. Hand washing? Never saw that.  Bougie prices for divey service? Nah thanks. I'd probably return try some of the salads had these clowns been working in a closed kitchen."}
{"text":"There certainly is no shortage of rotisserie chicken in the city but FLOCK seems to be successful at standing alone as a prime choice for delicious, healthy food choices within the radius in which it's set. The takeout spot that resides on the ground floor of Peter Street Condos rests almost out of place between Starbucks and Khao San Road, but once you find what you're looking for on their simplistic, yet thorough menu, you'll find it is a welcome addition to the one way strip in the Entertainment District. I'll take the descriptor right from the website, saying: \"FLOCK is a quality, healthy, and easy choice because it offers fresh ingredients, customizable options and is a one-stop rotisserie and greens spot for one or the whole family.\" They're definitely not wrong here on any count. FLOCK accommodates what you'd expect from a typical chicken dinner, only doing it as atypical as possible - and that's a good thing! For lighter or lunch-sized meals, you have a delicious selection of hand crafted \"superhero worthy\" salads (if I may) with unique dressings that absolutely complete each salad bowl, with or without chicken. You have but only one sandwich to choose from but it's a knock out of the park, offering a delicious beet & apple horseradish, dijon and fresh and crisp groceries atop pulled rotisserie (of course)! For a heartier meal, each salad is offered in a full size portion which you can add the house pulled chicken or even their house marinated tuna but the real meal lies in the whole or half chicken options. I'd recommend pairing a half-rotisserie or even just a leg/breast with one of their house-made sides like the baked cauliflower or rotisserie roasted beet and brussel sprouts! FLOCK is a one-off, offering an update, unique and delicious take on our, 'swiss' influenced rotisserie chicken history. I'll finish with what I started with by saying, again: \"There certainly is no shortage of rotisserie chicken in the city but FLOCK seems to be successful at standing alone as a prime choice for delicious, healthy food choices within the radius in which it's set.\""}
{"text":"My experience with Flock is a tale of customer service.  I work in the restaurant industry, and one time we had a woman complain to us (for non-valid reasons).  We sent her a gift card to make it up to her, and she wrote us an email saying when she complains to a business she wants two things: for the to acknowledge her complaint and listen to her, and for them to do something to try to make it up to her.  I agree with that idea, and Flock came through in a big way.  If I had a normal experience with Flock, I'd give it three stars.  It definitely adds value to the neighbourhood, and fills an empty niche -- lunch spot with healthy, fresh meals.  It closes at 8 pm, so this won't be your dinner spot unless it's a pick up on your way home from work.  The first time we tried it, it was just a few days after opening.  We ordered for pick up - phoned in at 7:50 pm and the woman answering the phone said they closed at 8.  We ordered two custom salads.  Went to pick it up, there was total chaos and disorganization in there (sort of understandable, it had just opened).  When we got home (which is less than 3 minutes away), our salads were completely wrong -- wrong dressing, missing ingredients (which we had paid extra for, like avocado and egg), and just overall a disappointment.  I was missing some of the best parts of the salad!  Since the place was now (we figured) closed for the day, we decided to just write in about our experience the following day.  We wrote to the restaurant and Cory (the owner, and chef from Harbord Room/THR) wrote us back write away (personally!).  He said to let him know the next time we were coming in, and he'd make it right.  Very good response, the right kind, and so fast.  We took him up on his offer yesterday, when we wrote in and said we'd be stopping by for take out again -- he said they would make us a bunch of stuff (chef's choice, I guess!).  This ended up including a whole chicken, two of their salad creations, and their two sides on offer.  My thoughts on the food (which is skewed because totally free and therefore more awesome): the salads were really good.  My eating companion doesn't eat delicious things, so he had them omit some stuff that would have made these salads even better, but they were good.  The chicken was good, although not any better than those pre-cooked whole chickens you buy at the grocery store, but it's nice to have already hot, cooked chicken waiting for you.  I liked the sweet potato side, it had a good kick to it, but the acorn squash was weird as heck.  The kind of weird where I kept going back to it being like, \"This is so weird....\" but not something I'd order on my own.  So in conclusion: customer service A+. Addition to the neighbourhood: A+.  Will go back, and try other things, because they secured me as a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"So I got caught up in the hype of this place and finally thought I would check it out. I tried the half chicken (got both sauces) along with the kimchi green beans and came to about 15 bucks. I will start with the positive, the chicken tasted pretty good overall...the flavor on the outside was good. Now the sauces were just meh, nothing special and not sure I would even recommend either. And the kimchi green beans were not good, the smelled bad (even for kimchi) and the flavors were just not great....bad choice there.  There are way better places in the area for lunch and especially for this price it is not worth it. I just dont see why so many people are in love with this place, not on my list of return visits."}
{"text":"Simple food options that revolve around chicken and power salads. The chicken sandwich here is tops and only $8. It's their pulled rotisserie chicken served on a soft bun topped with guac, fried onion, and this INcredible beet horseradish. The flavours are a perfect match. Easily one of the best chicken sandwiches I've tried. They also have sides you can add-on for $4. The sweet potato is pretty good. Their salads are next on my list!"}
{"text":"Came here in the mid afternoon. There were 2 customers ahead of us, service took a long time considering they weren't so busy. Staff looked over whelmed, perhaps they are still new and working the kinks out. No one smiled, not even management.   Chicken had good spices on the outside, meat was not as juicy as I anticipated rotisserie chicken to be. It was slightly over cooked. I am sure it might taste better if chicken was coming off the rotisserie instead of the holding cabinet to keep it warm. Skin on chicken was moist and soggy, again might be because it was kept warm for a long time.   I give them two stars for interior design and effort for trying to bring something new for a lighter fare option. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I went here today to try something new and I got the chicken sandwich. It took a while for them to make it, even though it was just a sandwich. Then when it finally was done, the girl at the front counter whispered my order number out. Obviously I didn't hear it so I waited and extra 5min till I realized it was just sitting there. Got back to work to eat it and the bun was SOAKED in the beet slaw, so much so that the bun fell apart almost instantly and was running down my hands. The horseradish was piled in the centre of the sandwich only so when I bit into the middle I just about died. $12+ for a teeny and not so great sandwich was disappointing and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food and the staff is very friendly and helpful, even my super picky mother was please! We will definitely go back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"I have been really excited to try Flock for a while now. I work in the area, and am always looking for new options. Today, I was walking by and stopped in for a chicken sandwich, and a sweet potatoes side. The side was good. However, when eating the sandwich I encountered bone and hard cartilage on 5 different occasions, once biting my teeth straight into bone. It is very disappointing to me that a sandwich could be assembled with this inside. I wanted to go back to try a salad, but after this experience, I am afraid that I will choke on a bone next time."}
{"text":"I frequent Flock on a weekly basis. It's fresh, delicious, healthy, and convenient.   I'm a big fan of the pulled chicken sandwich (super filling) and have recently tried their chicken soup - OMG - amazing.....an interesting take on chicken soup.  The service is always friendly.   The chicken is excellent quality. I buy a full roasted chicken sometimes and add it to salads to take to work for a few days.   Happy to be living above Flock : )"}
{"text":"My favourite place for fresh and delicious salads right now. My go-to in the area is salad days for value and volume, but Flock salads are packed with a lot of delicious ingredients, no filler here. My fave is fancy flock, love the additional touch of mint and grated coconut.  The take home chicken meal is not bad value as well and the chimchurri sauce is delish!"}
{"text":"Ok they get 5stars..I have a nut allergy and was a bit worried, but this place deals with allergies like pros! Thank you! Now on to the food, chicken sandwich was yum, bun delish and soft.. toppings amazing and the broccoli with kimchee delish!! Again I am super happy with the food and the awesome way that your staff helped avoiding nut contamination and using separate utensils to give me some peace of mind, you guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"I love everything about Flock's salads. There isn't one you could go wrong with. My personal favourites are the Fancy Flock and Power Flock. The salads are light and refreshing - perfect for days you want to eat cleaner and healthier. I do love to add their in-house made rotisserie chicken to my salads as a treat sometimes. Although the chicken isn't always necessary as the salad itself is so delicious on its own! The chicken is juicy and very flavourful. I always order through Ritual - which helps me avoid waiting in line during those peak hours. Staff is prompt and always friendly which is an added bonus!"}
{"text":"Very delicious. I had the Boho Flock with avocado and was very impressed. I wouldn't have put pomegranates in my own salad it they did it so so well. Plus the beets and quinoa were amazing.   It's a small space so it's packed during lunch but there are outlets available so if you do grab a seat it's a great place to work from.   I would definitely come back to try the rest of their salads!"}
{"text":"I saw this place just opened and even though I just had lunch, I was eagerly awaiting the opening of this place because I love my salad bowls.   From what I could see, they serve two things: Chicken and salad. Being mostly vegan, I obviously had to go for the salad.   I didn't pay attention to the chicken prices, but their salad had two prices - $8 for a half bowl and $11.50 for a full bowl.  While the container for the 1/2 bowl looks fairly small, they fill it up quite nicely and not just with lettuce/spring mix   They actually realize that lettuce is soft and pile on the toppings, so it was quite filling.    I ordered the Power Flock which had: Romaine Hearts & Baby Spinach, Steamed Squash, Marinated Black Beans, Daikon, Soy Beans, Cilantro, Goji Berries, Crispy Chick Peas, Sunflower Seeds with Carrot/Ginger/Soy Bean/ White Miso Dressing.    The flavour wasn't overpowering and all the ingredients were fresh. Dressing was lightly applied but what was great was that you could taste the flavours of all the ingredients.  Verdict: A high quality Salad Days with better taste, but more expensive and a cheaper, better version of Freshii. Will return."}
{"text":"Ate here before a TIFF film, as I thought this was similar concept to Cluck Clucks. Instead of a Fried Chicken and Waffles place, it's a very healthy restaurant.  Minus are that prices are too high for the portion and really isnt that flavourful. My half chicken with a side of roasted potato made Swiss Chalet's pigeons (although yummy pigeons) look huge. Bf liked his chicken burger though and highly recommends that (made without the horseradish)."}
{"text":"Limited menu pretty much wholly around Rotisserie chicken and unique salads.  I had a simple breast off chicken with their spicy sauce and it was fantastic.  The sauce on the white pieces I pulled off that breast were simply great!  That said, the menu is really limited so if you don't like chicken I wouldn't bother and the prices are a bit on the high side!   It felt really good to have a nice simple piece of well cooked chicken though!"}
{"text":"Ordered the \"Fancy Flock\" with chicken. Generally I don't do meat and eat tons of vegetables in every combination and honestly, my salad was divine. It's below in my building so will regularly flock here:)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Healthy! And extremely generous portions ! Definitely coming back here again"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed. I've been to Flock on Harbord Street and the pulled sandwich was amazing--crispy bun, pretty plating and complimenting merged flavours and textures. This Flock on Adelaide was the exact opposite of what I had the first time.  I decided to get the same chicken sandwich here and I'm surprised this is a takeout place and not a sit-down. It was given in a takeout box, so I didn't expect a wonderful presentation. But I can't express how the sandwich had failed my standards; the bun was so stale!  The bun wasn't even toasted, so it was neither warm nor crispy at all. Secondly, the bun itself was stale! It was tough to rip apart and it looks like those Chinese bakery buns that have been sitting out for a week. I just threw away and ate the filling.  The filling was okay. There weren't a lot of crispy onions or avocado and the chicken was like room temperature. It just seems like the sandwich has been sitting there for a while and they just wrapped it up for you.  I can't get over the stale bun and it really ruined my fond memories of this sandwich. I don't think I'm coming back for another chance."}
{"text":"Pretty great salads and my sandwich was just fine.     The only real knock I have is the menu is pretty small.  There isn't much room for variety here, so you better like the couple things they serve.    That being said, they do a few things really well."}
{"text":"Stopped in around 7pm on a weeknight for a bite to eat between errands.  Decided on the Rotisserie Pulled Chicken Sandwich ($9) which comes on a milk bun with some chicken, avocado, lettuce onion and a horseradish/beat/apple slaw. Side dish options include Rotisserie Roasted Sweet Potatoes w/ Chili & Lime Salt, Cold Edamame w/ Chili & Lime Salt, or Steam Green Beans w/ Kimchi & Crispy Onions, each priced at $4.50 plus tax. I went with the roasted sweet potatoes.  I have to say that for a business that has 3 locations and growing, I'm surprised the food is so bland and getting such positive response. The flavours in everything were surprisingly subdued. Maybe that's what their aiming for, but the chicken sandwich was surprisingly bland, and the horseradish slaw stood out more than any of the flavours (I'm sure I'm not alone that I'd rather taste the chicken or avocado). As well, the sweet potatoes just tasted like sweet potatoes, completely devoid of the \"Chili & Lime Salt\" flavours I was hoping for. In efforts of improving my experience I asked for some hot sauce (a classic topping for both chicken and sweet potatoes). Turns out they don't carry hot sauce?! Instead closest they have is a house made Tropical Pepper Sauce. Guess what? Once again the flavours were subdued (no spice, mediocre flavour that really didn't improve the chicken or sweet potatoes).  So for a meal that cost $15.26 after tax for a sandwich and side dish, I left fed but disappointed. As such, 2 stars."}
{"text":"We were attracted by the smell of a really good chicken and couldn't just miss this place! It's really really awesome! Tastes sooooo good and not as expensive as I thought..:) it's just $9 for great tasty sandwich with a good quality. I'll definitely come here again. Thanks guys for your awesome service! See ya soon"}
{"text":"Chicken is fantastic - whether it be alone, pulled on a sandwich or with a salad.   Their classic sandwich looks beautiful but it would be a 5 if the bread was better. It seems very ordinary and doesn't match the quality of chicken.   If you're on a health kick, pick up a whole chicken for meal prep. It is tasty!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place through my work colleagues as they always come here to get their salads. They have an assortment of really healthy meals here from their chicken, soup and salads. Our team had a work lunch so we got takeout from here. I ordered the classic rotisserie half chicken with the house Caribbean pepper sauce. It was quite delicious and the chicken was nicely cooked- tender and juicy. The sauce definitely complimented the chicken. Pretty decent portions for this. I also wanted to try the one of their soups so I got the Flock Stock which is basically their twist on a chicken soup. It was a pretty good size and quite flavourful. Not your ordinary chicken soup. Overall, the food was great! Will definitely come back again during lunch and try their big salads!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from this location on Foodora many times and have been happy; however, the last two times, I received incomplete orders. First - missing dessert, then missing sauces for the chicken. Disappointed and unsatisfied. I was the biggest fan, but I can't trust ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I had the boho salad and opted to add pulled chicken and avocado. Even at the half size this was very filling and I have to say is probably the best salad I've ever had. There was a definite medley of flavours and textures. Everything tasted very fresh.  The pulled chicken was okay but I will definitely come back to try the rotisserie!"}
{"text":"Amazing salad and rotisserie chicken! My favourite is their Boho Flock salad - everything is so fresh and the chicken is amazing with chimichurri sauce!"}
{"text":"I love their rotisserie chicken, it's tender, juicy and well seasoned without being over seasoned.  The sauces to go with the chicken are great too!    Now, I LOVE their salads.   They are packed with all things healthy, like kale and such....but they end up tasting great.    This means i tend to get a good filling meal, without feeling heavy or sleepy afterwards, which is great as a power lunch.     Their chicken dinner is a pretty decent deal, I'll likely get that on Foodora the next time we are home and want healthy takeout.   Or I'm happy just getting a few roast chickens and cooking my own sides when guests come, and then say I did it because, how would they know?  :-P    I'm glad Flock came around, great salads, great chicken.....very decent food!"}
{"text":"We ordered using Ubereats, ordered legs and the Boho flock.  The chicken legs were well marinated and tender.  The salad had a good portion of quinoa, kale and pomegranates; the salad ingredients complimented each other pretty well, it's crunchy, sweet and fresh."}
{"text":"The sides are decent, but the chicken is usually undercooked. I'm sure it's safe, but it's not falling of the bone. You'll be struggling to cut the meat off the bone with plastic cutlery."}
{"text":"Second lacklustre experience at this location. I won't be making the same mistake a third time. Extremely disorganized and slow service. The food is decent but nowhere near worth the price. A *filling* lunch here will average about $20.  The sandwich made me wish I was eating a better sandwich. #sad #fakelunch #increaseyourchickenportionsonthesandwich"}
{"text":"Flock yeah!   Today was my first day at a new job - visiting headquarters in a new city, a new country. They offered to order me lunch (woot!), and showed me the Flock menu.   I didn't even make it past the first section.   The minute I read the description of the Pulled Chicken Sandwich I was sold. And then to find sweet potatoes as a side option? It's like they knew what I needed in life to feel at home, sated, and ready to work for the rest of the afternoon.   And when the goods were delivered? Everything I'd dreamed of and then some. Great combinations of flavors - way to take a chicken sandwich to new heights! And that bun.... the portions were ample enough thatI had the leftovers for dinner just now, and I'm probably going to be running down to Flock for lunch all week.   Fast, healthy, tasty - Flock on with your bad selves ;)"}
{"text":"Around the corner from my office so this has become a regular lunch take-out spot for me the past couple of weeks. Intrigued by the high reviews, and was attracted to the first Yelp photo because I love a bunch of stuff crammed into a bowl.  I've only ordered one thing so far: the Boho Flock. I like that its base is marinated kale and quinoa with other goodies I love, like beets and carrots. Top that up with some fresh chicken to balance the sweets (pomegranates) and it's a pretty winning combination.  And oh that chicken -- it tastes like something you would have at Thanksgiving or Christmas. It's so warm and essentially melts in your mouth. I usually don't talk about meat like that, but it's definitely the highlight of this place.  I like the atmosphere, convenience, nice service, and I don't usually have to wait very long to grab my order. Will surely be back many times to come, and plan to  explore the menu further -- the pulled chicken sandwich sounds insane!"}
{"text":"Very very good chicken. Maybe the best rotisserie chicken I have ever had. The 2.5 stars is because I just got home and there was barely any sauce with it!!! Pic to follow. Not sure if it was just a mistake?"}
{"text":"Great healthy food, a nice quick stop to pick up dinner after the gym. I really like the fancy salad and the sweet potatoes, but looking forward to trying more.  I have been twice so far, and admittedly, they forgot to ad the chicken to my salad on my second trip, but they corrected it quickly when I asked."}
{"text":"Came here purely out of convenience, as I had some spare time and there was a parking spot outside.  Although the salads are made from a variety of unique ingredients, none of them were calling me so I ended up buying their rotisserie chicken sandwich. The sandwich was definitely soft and juicy. The meat was tender and everything seemed fresh. The horseradish/beet/apple slaw did overpower the other ingredients just a little bit. The crispy onions did add another dimension to the sandwich.  This location has a few tables for groups as well as a few countertops for individuals. Lighting brightens up the place and makes it inviting.  I will definitely keep this place on my good, convenient food list. However, I will probably try another menu selection in the future."}
{"text":"Craving something super healthy, I decided to pop into this place as I was in the area on my way to the leafs game (Go Leafs Go!!).   Walked into a confusing looking restaurant.   There was a fridge storing food in the middle of the restaurant (ok - a little to the left). Take away boxes and salad bowls hovered above our heads.   Seating is perimeter bar style and a bit awkward if you ask me. The overall design of this place isn't functional. A better layout would make the ambience less institutional. But there may be structural limitations (not sure).   On the the important stuff...the Food:  Ordered the Frenchy Flock salad. A bunch of mixed greens, lentils, roasted cauliflower, yummy onions, an egg and a whole bunch of other goodies. A lot of places cheap out by stuffing salads with a lot of lettuce and missing the key ingredients listed on the menu.  Not this place! There's definitely a well balanced and generous mix of ingredients.   Also ordered the Coup Soup. A butternut-squashy, coconut soup with corn and hints of lemon grass. The flavours were good and thankfully the soup was not salty at all. My only recommendation is that the soup be served at a slightly higher temperature.   Great first experience and I'll be back to try the chicken (on a cheat day!)."}
{"text":"Decided to check it out due to the hype.  And it mostly lives up to it.  It's simple: they sell rotisserie chicken and salad - that's it.  It's part of the that 'healthy food' trend- but it's not lacking in taste and flavour.  Grabbed the pulled rotisserie chicken sandwich ($8) and the steamed squash with pumpkin seeds and spicy yogurt ($4 - but no longer on the current menu, they must rotate them).  The chicken sandwich was very good - all the toppings work great together on a top-notch bun.  I actually really liked the squash side - it sounds like a bunch of bullshit health-nut nonsense - but it was very tasty and filling.  Had a bit of the lady's salad ($11 full size) with the tuna (+$3) add-on and it seems to merits the high pricepoint - lots of fresh ingredients and they work great as a whole.  Yup - I like this salad bar.  Colour me surprised."}
{"text":"Even though I can't tell you exactly everything that was in it, it was the BEST salad I have ever had! So savory!"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like Flock and was ecstatic to hear this restaurant was opening from my colleagues near our workplace. It's healthy food, decent value, and tasty if you like quality rotisserie chicken and a great variety of salads. You're served quickly and this place also has a nice vibe.   Unfortunately, a few hours after eating here (11:45am, Aug 24/16) I experienced stomach pains and a high fever. A trip to the doctor a couple days later and a stool sample test confirmed I had food poisoning from Campylobacter jejuni. This type of bacteria tends to be contracted from improperly prepared/handled poultry. I cannot definitively say that Flock caused my food poisoning, but my \"gut\" tells me it was the quarter chicken I had at Flock. I'll never be back, but management at Flock, if you are reading this, I really hope you guys improve your sanitation and food prep protocols and make this place everything I hoped it would have been."}
{"text":"Had the pulled chicken sandwhich. It was pretty good. Hot sauce is 50cents extra and it's not a good hot sauce. The side of sweet potatoes was amazing though! Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"The good: their service was good and their branding looks nice...  The bad: but the chicken (highlight of this almost purely takeout place) was just alright. Tbh I felt their soup tastes better than the chicken itself. It wasn't horrible, but for the price I paid and the portion that I get, I honestly rather get Loblaws chicken (gasp!). Good takeout location though.  The ugly: nothing too ugly here.  Neutral: good for takeout. No seating area."}
{"text":"Having completely defeated the purpose of going to a rotisserie place, I ordered a vegetarian option - the power flock salad and coop soup and they were both great!  The salad was extremely hearty and filled with good ingredients.  They definitely didn't skimp out and I hope they continue to deliver these great salads.  The coop soup was also great as well with chunks of sweet potato and a great coconut flavour.    Overall, I would definitely come back...and maybe even try their chicken!"}
{"text":"Apparently the latest downtown lunch franchise for harried office workers, I got to try FLOCK for the first time today. It has a good formula, producing good food (taste & quality) in a brisk fashion. I got the pulled chicken sandwich & my lunchtime companion got the salad. Both were tasty. I got the roasted sweet potatoes as a side. Also tasty. The salad can be a good meal with leftovers. I endorse the place."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service, some lineups at lunch time as should be expected.  Food is fresh and healthy.  The chicken sandwich is delicious and the side dishes are creative.  Try the side of squash, lentils, raisins, and yogurt for something a little bit unusual.  Some might consider it a bit pricey for a fast food lunch - sandwich and side is $12+ tax, but you get what you pay for in terms of quality of ingredients."}
{"text":"A little pricier than I would have preferred but overall the power flock salad was so worth it! More of a takeout/fast food environment but there are stools and benches to sit at."}
{"text":"I've had it catered many times and stopped in for take away, never disappointed. Always full of flavour and a go to healthier lunch spot!"}
{"text":"My work recently moved to this area and so we've all been excited to try all the amazing restaurants that are right at our finger tips!  Flock has become my \"go-to\" when I forget my lunch but want something fast and healthy. Their pulled chicken sandwich is something I go home and tell my spouse about.   Let me break this sandwich down for you. It has fresh smashed avocado on a delicious bun with yummy rotisserie chicken. But the thing that brings this sandwich to the next level is horseradish beet coleslaw. Who has even heard of such a thing!? The horseradish adds such a delicious kick that you feel it in your nose. I cannot stress this enough, it is damn delicious!  And their food isn't the only thing that is top notch, they have superb customer service. The manager recognizes me when I come in and is always beyond friendly. When I had one issue with an order they listened to my feedback and then provided a free future order.   This is a really great place to pop in for a bite. Not a ton of room to sit but if you want to pick up something to go, I highly recommend!  Thanks Flock! I'm sure you'll see me again this week!  -Ashley Marie"}
{"text":"I was downtown and looking for a light and healthy meal - from the outside the place seemed open and bright. There's a number of outlets along the wall to charge your laptop and phone.  Ordered a half sized Boho Flock salad for dinner after what felt like a long week, it made a good Friday night dinner. That beet basil and orange vinaigrette was delicious!! (need to bottle that up!)"}
{"text":"Good food, but needs a few adjustments. I ordered the pulled rotisserie sandwich and a side of the rotisserie sweet potatoes with lime and black pepper.  The beet/horseradish slaw on the sandwich was awesome, not spicy just very flavourful I loved it. The chicken was very moist and also had great flavour. The BIG downside to the sandwich, though, was the choice of bun. The bread was a SOAKING WET MESS even just eating it 5 minutes after ordering. I couldn't even pick it up it was so soggy and I ended up eating the insides with a fork and throwing out the bun, which made me sad! They should definitely use a bun with a heavier crust so it can hold up all the moisture in the filling.  Also the side sweet potatoes were good but also needed more salt (they were bland) and a few pieces (although appearance wise looked done) were raw in the middle.  All in all, good chicken and good slaw, I'd go again but try something different. Price point was average (10-15$) and I liked the water faucet to fill your own glass. Also the staff were friendly and quick.  Fix the bun guys, and you'll have a winner-winner-chicken-dinner sammy haha"}
{"text":"Finally found the perfect salad place beside work. Most filling large salad ever. Literally lasted me for both lunch and dinner! Thanks to my co workers for recommending boho flock, the perfect introduction to all the other salads on the menu! See you soon again flock!"}
{"text":"O.M.G. I don't think I can adequately explain my love for this place. In a sea of lunch options in this area I didn't think it was possible to stand out so much but Flock, you rock.  As a vegetarian I was skeptical when a co-worker recommended it but I should apologize to for ever doubting her. Organized, clean, efficient, cost effective and DELICIOUS - this place does fast lunch right. For the salads, you start with a base salad and if you wish, add a protein (chicken, tuna, avocado, egg) in either a half portion or full portion. And we aren't talking a measly mixed greens base...we're talking kale, quinoa, roasted squash, cabbage, arugula, beets, lentils...the list goes on and on. Check out their menu and you'll be impressed, I guarantee it.   The half portion is a very decent size for a very decent price - $7.91 total for a salad that easily goes for twice that in other restaurants. I didn't add another protein today - I had the Boho Flock that has quinoa and pumpkin seats for protein to begin with. It has perhaps the most amazing dressing I've ever tasted - beet/basil/orange vinegrette. Not to mention the kale, cherry tomatoes, roasted and raw beets, dried currants and pomegranates - this profile was heaven from the first bite to the last.   And that's just one salad. My bff likes the Power Flock with chicken (and believe me, she's a chicken + salad connoisseur) that's a romaine base with squash, avocado, orange, walnuts, marinated chickpeas, goji berries, sunflower seeds, soy beans, sprouts with a carrot/ginger/soybean/white miso dressing.  Ok, ok, I'm just literally rewriting you the menu and what you want to know is WHY its so good - the produce is fresh, clean, crispy, the ingredients and dressing are well thought out and satisfying, made to order, quickly prepared and appropriately priced. The restaurant doesn't smell like weird rotisserie chicken which as a vegetarian, is a blessing. But apparently for meat eaters, the chicken is fantastic too.  Apparently you can get rotisserie chicken dinners with pick your sides and a sandwich but for me, I'll dive in and out of the four amazing salads in a happy rotation from half to full portions, with and without added protein for years to come. Thank you Flock!"}
{"text":"If I spot a fancy looking salad on a menu then I just have to try it. Ergo, I have tried a lot of \"restaurant quality\" salads in my day and very, very few hold a candle to Flock. This place is absolutely amazing. Their salads - ALL of them - are as good as it gets. Its almost painful having to pick just one to eat. And even though you definitely don't need it, adding some of their signature rotisserie chicken takes an already stellar meal over the edge.   And if you secretly have a thing for Swiss Chalets greasy fries (which you know you do) then you will be obsessed with Flock's crispier, lighter and more flavourful offering.   Seriously, don't think just go and eat. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Just ordered take out from here and it was great! Love that the chicken is hormone and antibiotic free and it's tasty!"}
{"text":"I went in after being attracted by the delicious smell of roast chicken, and am so glad I went in! Their pulled chicken sandwich is out of this world, and is very light, despite the large size. I originally took a star off because the quality of their salads have gone downhill since the first time I visited, but am adding the star back for the superb customer service I received since then. Vanessa, the owner, is a very helpful and generous person, who kindly took the time to contact me regarding my complaints. While it is almost impossible to avoid bad experiences caused by staff, seeing management step up like this really puts Flock in a positive light for me.   Tl;dr Flock sandwiches are delicious, their salads are tasty, and the management is out of this world amazing!"}
{"text":"So much hype when this place opened, but I resisted going until I found a discount/deal on the 1/2 salad. Finally I caved and decided to see what the fuss was about.   OK I admit it -- it's good. Their salads have a lot of interesting stuff you won't find at other healthy places include kale, goji berries, pomegranate seeds, and so many other \"so-called\" super-foods. And you won't feel guilty eating here (unless you look at your bill).  Which brings me to my big beef about their chicken. There just ain't enough of it! I got a few ounces (really there wasn't enough space for more anyways in the small bowl they pack it in) but those few morsels of chicken they give you just leave you wanting for more.  My other complaint is how they jam everything in the bowl and put all the dressing in the bottom (or maybe it just settled there over time, I'm not sure). Anyways, I'm half done my salad and I realize -- I have only a few bites of kale left but a whole bowl's worth of dressing! would have been better to give me a bigger bowl with some airspace so I could shake it up, or next time I'll just order the dressing on the side.  Don't get me wrong, it was quick, tasty and healthy -- perfect for lunch for a lot of people. But a half salad with a few bits of chicken is $12+tax -- that's a little too much, and there are other (albeit less interesting) salads available at lower prices in the Bloor/Yonge neighbourhood. I'd rather save a few bucks and get my chicken juiced up with hormones and steroids."}
{"text":"OMGoodness. The chicken is freaking amazing! I could have eaten a whole flock by myself. I totally recommend the side of squash too. Delicious. Delicious. I'm already thinking about my next meal here. Seattle needs one of these restaurants. Great value for a nutritious meal."}
{"text":"Post Run Meal.... Flock was the best decision we made tonight.  I had the half Power Flock and added chicken ($7 plus $3 for the chicken). The bowl was filled with goodness, it was absolutely spectacular. The bowl contained so much protein, from the chicken, chickpeas and edamame beans.  The miso dressing was what put the whole meal together, however in my opinion I think that they over did it a little bit with the dressing.  Overall for the price, you are definitely getting your money's worth."}
{"text":"Got the half Boho Salad through Ritual. Got the shredded chicken as an add-on. Salad was very tasty and I've been back a bunch of times since. Fresh ingredients and good portions!"}
{"text":"Grabbed an early dinner at Flock today and was not dissapointed.  Fresh salad with premium ingredients (Kale, Goji Berries, Red Quinoa). The Chicken...ohhh the chicken.... So fresh, so moist, so flavourful. I ordered the half with a side of the sweet potatoes with lime salt and chili. The chicken came with a Caribbean Hot Sauce (sweet, savoury and just the tad of spice) and fresh chimichurri. Ill be back for the Sandwich or one of the salads next time.  The space is lofty and clean, large windows for people watching too."}
{"text":"I have been too so many places. Let me summarize this place - all it sells is over priced food. Who pays additional for meat in their salads. Will I pay 12$ for just  Greens ?"}
{"text":"I'm debating between a 3 and a 4. The chicken is good and kind of unexpected to find in the area. 9 dollars give you a halved chicken and that is a leg a wing and a breast, it is pretty good. The chicken is on the dry side and the hot sauce, for someone who likes spicy, is barely hot. But I walked in after a hard leg day at gym and this place kind of saved me so it is a 4 star. I like it but I won't come here from king east just for this chicken."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Polite and friendly people. Healthy and fresh options. The salads are packed with awesome ingredients.  Best rotisserie chicken I've ever had. Super juicy and the pepper sauce is incredible. The sweet potatoes have so much flavour and cooked just right. Would come back again and again."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0 stars. I ordered a salad through Uber Eats and paid $5 to add chicken. The salad arrived without chicken. I called the restaurant to get a refund and they said they could not refund the $5 unless I came to the restaurant. I am at work and cannot simply leave to go to the restaurant. If this were an option, I would have gotten takeout, not delivery. Unacceptable customer service to not fulfill an order and not offer a refund."}
{"text":"Flock off there's no way chicken should taste this good.   Whoa. I came in with zero expectations because of coworkers and left supremely satisfied. The wait had me hesitant on how good it'd be but oh boy it was worth it.   Let's talk about the chicken. Skin is somehow crisp and moist at the same time (?) and the sauce is no joke. Unlike the messy sauces or spices at other rotisserie joints, this is a clean and flavourful chicken. The meat is above average and was never too dry despite sitting out for a while.  Let's talk about the salads. BOHOMYGAWD. Let's just say that I'm a fan. Then again, anything with kale and pomegranate is a win in my books.   I will flock back."}
{"text":"the boho salad is amazing.  I really want to try the soup now!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a quick lunch. The menu is simple, but may take a long time to read. Flock has a lot of interesting items in their salads, priced at $7 for half, $11 for full. I had the Power Salad, which ahd \"orange segement\" (i.e. orange slices without the peel), squash, chickpeas, beans, and avacado. However, there isn't much protein and you have to add $3 for chicken. Not the cheapest salad, and though they do sell rotisserie chicken, the one in my salad wasn't particularly notable. I think the full portion would have been more filling, but I don't think spending $15 on a salad would've left me feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"Soooooooooooooo pleased with this place. I just ate my dream meal here.  They have HUGE rotisserie chickens, these are full sized chickens, not the little grocery store type ones you get at Loblaw for $10.  They also have a fresh salad bar where you can pick from one of their 4 salads or create your own. Think Freshii but with way better premium ingredients (kale, goji berries, sprouts, etc).  Overall the menu is super healthy, they serve chicken sandwiches and have a few other sides but it's not a greasy fries and onion rings type shit.  We took home a whole chicken ($17) and one of the salads (Power Salad, $11) for dinner and it was so delicious that I have to write about it as it digests in my stomach. The chicken was super moist and came with a spicy sophisticated chimichuri type sauce on the side. I will definitely be back for repeat take out visits."}
{"text":"I surprisingly liked Flock a lot! I ordered the pulled rotisserie chicken sandwich with the side of green beans. The sandwich comes with a beet, horseradish, and apple mix and lettuce. I was hesitant about it because I don't love horseradish or beets but I didn't want to remove all of the toppings so I decided to give it a go. The sandwich was so good! The horseradish and beets weren't overwhelming flavours and they complimented the chicken really well. Chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly and the sesame seed bun was nice too. The green bean sides come with fried onions and kimchi but I removed the kimchi. The serving of beans was generous so you definitely won't be hungry after. Great takeaway place that is relatively healthy!"}
{"text":"I had walked past the location on Harbord street a few times when I was going to Yasu. Never had the chance to try it so when it opened near my condo, I thought I'd give it a go.   The power flock salad is amazing, especially with some Chicken and avocado on top. Was not a big fan of the French salad. Have been 3 or 4 times now and it is great to have another good eatery near home. Definitely go with the power flock if it is your first time and the half salad with chicken filled me up and I am a big guy!"}
{"text":"Everyone should be flocking to Flock!  To be honest, my first experience at Flock was not pleasant. I had made the mistake of placing my order through Hurrier, a food delivery company. Unfortunately, Hurrier \"hurried\" the order. The Fancy Flock salad with chicken ($10) was submerged in liquid and had random bones in the salad. It looks like the salad was regurgitated by a bird of some sort (pun intended)  I had e-mailed Flock about my experience and head Flocker, Cory Vitiello had offered a complimentary meal to compensate for the lackluster experience. Second time around, Cory had entrusted an Uber driver with the sacred lunch. Unfortunately, the hungry Uber driver had flocked away with my lunchtime delight.   Third time around, Cory had arrived to my office in a taxi. He brought a bunch of goodies including a new side (roasted miso brussel sprouts), a large Power flock made with Kale, a large Fancy Flock, pulled rotisserie chicken sandwich and two bottles of Pierre water. I still have left overs for another day after sharing the meal with my colleague. The food was beyond delicious. As much as I had adored the salads, the chicken sandwich in brioche buns was by far my favorite. The bun has a hint of garlic butter. The sandwich itself was garnished with beet & apple horseradish, dijon mayo, green leaf, crispy onion, tomato & avocado. It was an interplay of flavours and texture. If I have to eat a sandwich for the rest of my life, this would be it!   Thank you for your generosity Cory! I will be flocking to Flock for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing Boho salad with chicken. The salad bowl was filled to the brim with so many of the ingredients that every forkful was a new flavour. The service was great and I didn't have to wait long for my food. I am not giving full stars as I think that $18 for a salad is steep."}
{"text":"The best chicken sandwich ever!! The salads are amazing and the staff is friendly. If you are looking for healthy and tasty food, this is a very good place!"}
{"text":"I'm on a paleo-like diet right now so if I travel,.. rotisserie places are a good option.  This place is kind of like a way, way better upscale Swiss Chalet.  Yes it is a bit pricey but the meat is fantastic. However, for me the Boho salad was something that blew me away - get it.  Together, with yams,  it was a great combo for my restrictions.  It totally hit the spot."}
{"text":"My co-workers all rave about it but its on the pricey side (its a chicken place where the default salad doesn't come with chicken, so a half sized chicken salad is $12(!). I tried the chicken sandwich and it was decent although hard to eat because the bread was a bit too stiff."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wanted to grab a healthier bite in town while we were visiting, and holy flock this place was good (sorry, had too). I got the Power Flock salad and added chicken and avocado (btw the fact that the place is literally called flock but none of the salads come with chicken included on it is a bit disappointing). Flavor was delicious and the crispy chick peas were some nice crunch for a salad. And it's rather healthy!  Service was friendly enough. It's a 5 on flavor, but 4 on price. I ended up at $23.03 which is not an average lunch. Full size salad was $11.50, add chicken (since it doesn't come with it) was $4, and then I added avocado for some creaminess and that was another $2. And to wash it down I got a GoodDrink iced tea which was $2.88. So a bit pricy for my everyday lunch."}
{"text":"Overall I enjoy Flock. I live just a 3 min walk away so it's often my lunch choice when I'm looking for a quick take out option nearby. I typically prefer to order ahead of time on Ritual, so I don't have to wait in line at all.  First, let's discuss the food. I love a good rotisserie chicken, and my favourite order here is the pulled chicken sandwich, with avocado, beets and horseradish. I've also had their quarter chicken, which is yummy but more suitable as a snack. You'd definitely need to order sides to be full.   My issue with this place is actually the prices. I ordered the family pack once for about $33 (don't think this is available anymore), and found it extremely overpriced. The chicken was not that big, and I didn't find it particularly better than Costco whole rotisserie chicken, which sells for half the price. Likewise, the salads and sides, while quite delectable, are vastly overpriced for what it is.   That said, I still like going to flock occasionally, but will avoid just ordering the whole rotisserie chicken in the future."}
{"text":"You win, darling husband. Flock rocks.   I had the Frenchie salad last night, hold the onions, add cheese and a side of chicken. It was a huge, healthy meal. I was left feeling full and great afterwards. Even though Flock has a few choice salads that are mega popular, they still make each one to order, something you can taste.   Flock here for you lunch or supper.   I've found your flock, Shepherd.  OK, I'm done."}
{"text":"Just received my worst meal from this location. I'm so done with them.  I love the food, always order the same (or almost same) menu items but today was the worst. I ordered through Foodora paid a premium for delivery and tipped the del. person only to receive food that was not prepared today - who knows how old it was... Slimey brown mango topping and the rest of the salad had a bitter taste (Fancy flock), and the roasted sweet potatoes I thought would be fine were old and mushy. Had to be a few days old - gross.  Everything went in the trash after a few bites.  I'll never order from this location again because the people who work there just don't care what goes out the door.  *** btw I went back to them since my previous review because the quality did get better, but after today I am done."}
{"text":"Discovered Flock through Foodora.  I had never heard about it before but I could tell by the ingredients in the salads that it should be good - and it was! I had a half power salad and chicken breast.  I also ordered a second sauce because I wanted to try both.  My favourite was the Caribbean pepper sauce  which was a medium hot. The chicken was moist and everything tasted great.  A little expensive for take out but I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"flock on...flock off...flock good...but never flock bad!  a blog site that i frequent, recommended this place as a \"new age swiss chalet\" personally i think that's disrespectful to swiss chalet...Swiss chalet can't hold a candle to this place...truthfully.  located within a comfortable walking distance from either queen or king street, this one off spot, is utterly simple and amazing, everything is promoted as super fresh, and super fresh is what you get. walked in to find a concrete sanctuary of what seemed like a hall style restaurant, what with the high ceilings, everything is super bright and the menu display is very legible. i was a bit taken back by how many people were not eating dinner at this restaurant. as when we walked it, we were the only customers. my first \"complaint\" if at all, they have a tiny piece of space on the menu board that says to order here...but it is behind a concrete pillar. ordered the food, and sat down to one of a dozen seats. the food arrived at the table (impressive) within about ten minutes if that, i loved how we could watch the open display of it all...the start of the meal, all the way to being wrapped up, and brought to our table.  now to the good stuff  The absolute flavor of this food, is amazing, i love how they combine ingredients together to make an amazing and light blend come together. not withstanding as a hot sauce freak, they offer a hot sauce here, that is on the medium scale, very flavorful and very balanced, which is hard to accomplish, the chimichurri sauce was ok...as i was fascinated with the hot sauce.   very happy to have spent a date night here, great food, cozy environment, killer staff service and amazing ingredients\hot sauce.   bbq pulled chicken FTW...im a fan, and i will flock here more often ;)   P.S. they have free wifi :)"}
{"text":"I've only been to flock once but it was amazing and I've been longing to return since the first time I ate their food!  I got the power flock (minus goji berries) and it was absolute perfection. I loved the combination of the squash with the avocado and edamame and alfalfa sprouts!! I could go on but I definitely recommend the power flock, I think it's their signature dish too!  I added chicken into mine and only got the half size (I'm a hungry gal and that was more than filling for me!!!) The chicken was amazing, they gave a good portion and it didn't cost very much to add it in.   I discovered this place because I was interning throughout the summer at eTalk in the Bell building and Flock is about a 5 minute walk away. After I started raving about how good it was I realized many others were into it as well, including Ben Mulroney eTalk's anchor! From what I understand he lives a very healthy lifestyle and eats very clean so for him to say he likes Flock gives it the stamp of healthy approval :)  I will definitely be returning! Maybe to try something different, maybe the same thing; but either way I'll be back :)"}
