{"text":"Eating here regularly I can tell you that Fadi is great if you're looking for something a little different that is always good.  I almost always order the chicken plate, which is definitely the best selling dish among those that eat there regularly.  The also offer beef, falafel, and plenty of vege options.  There are brochettes, but they take extra time to make.  The sandwiches are good if you're in a rush, or if you want to save some for later.  One final note, if you're going on a date later or just don't want to have awful breathe all day, AVOID the GARLIC sauce.  It is very potent and will be on your breathe for quite some time!"}
