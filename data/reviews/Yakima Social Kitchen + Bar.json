{"text":"The traditional eggs Benedict was delicious... the hollandaise sauce was not too thick. The self cured salmon was very healthy...

The restaurant is in the new Marriott hotel which opened last year in the airport. The manager Doug welcomed us with superior service. It's all about customer service .....they know how to serve breakfast with a smile! 

Great stop before our flight!"}
{"text":"While staying overnight at the new Marriott In-Terminal hotel at Calgary International terminal we went to Yakima for a casual dinner. We enjoyed a starter of cured salmon which was delicious and a nice size for sharing. We then ordered a turkey sandwich and a roast beef sandwich. They were very generous which allowed us to share as well. Both sandwiches were excellent. The fries were amazing. 

Our waitress Marcela took excellent care of us and Chef Sharma came by a couple of times to see how we were enjoying our meal. The manager also made a point of checking on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Excellent service.

This is an excellent choice at YYC."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Worth the trip to the airport simply to dine at Yakima. The attention of our server (Michael), and his helpfulness to explain the dishes in the menu were outstanding.

We tried the cheese churros as appetizer, which is a very exotic (and outstandingly executed) creation. I consider myself very well versed in the field of churros, but I never tried anything like these before.

As main, we shared a cured salmon flatbread which was perfectly prepared and served. On the side, we had an order or potato lavash, a kind of Armenian cracker that I hadn't tried before but which I found peculiar and delicate. 

The prices are very reasonable, and I would even say very affordable for the amazing quality of the food and service. 

Yakima is a hidden gem. I won't mind the drive up to the airport nor paying for the parking to enjoy dining there again."}
{"text":"This was a very nice surprise.  My wife and we're looking for something different for lunch and tried Yakima. Estelle greeted us and she could not have been friendlier! My elk sandwich was very good. My wife enjoyed her chicken noodle bowl. The date and honey toffee pudding was very good. 

Estelle and Yakima are great ambassadors for Calgary!"}
{"text":"I like that there is parking if you aren't catching a flight. We used the valet for the Marriott Hotel and were served promptly. The manager allowed us to sit wherever we would like in the restaurant. The menu is small but has a lot of options. We ordered two steak sandwiches that were cooked to perfection and a turkey sandwich. Service was great. The turkey sandwich was dry but the remaining orders were good and they were able to accommodate a gluten-free diet. I like this space it's modern and open kitchen concept."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by for lunch, and what a great surprise! Estelle greeted us at the door and was very bubbly and welcoming. She was extremely attentive, friendly and efficient. I had the chicken noodle bowl, with plump chunks of chicken in a tasty broth, and Greg had a braised and pulled elk sandwich with fries. Both were mouth wateringly delicious. The fries were crispy and fluffy inside - the perfect fries! 
Then Estelle recommended the honey and date pudding, which came in a huge mason jar, topped with ice cream and a warm toffee sauce. Wow, I will definitely be back if I have another stop over at YYC."}
{"text":"So disappointed! I have eaten at this restaurant many times during my stays at the airport Marriott and have always loved the food at Yakima. It seems that they have a new menu and all my favourites (e.g., shrimp bisque, Ni√ßoise salad) are gone. However, I was excited to try a new menu item - the lettuce wraps. What a disappointment. The filling for the wraps was pale chunks of chicken breast and equally pale peanuts swimming in what appeared to be, and tasted like, bottled Thai sweet chilli sauce, with a few green onions thrown in for colour. Accompanying the filling was a bottle of hot sauce whose distinctly Mexican flavour totally clashed with the sweet chilli sauce, and a half head of iceberg lettuce that was so tightly wound that only the first 3 leaves were suitable for wrapping. The only redeeming feature was the yogurt raita, which was delightful.

Although the food was horribly disappointing, the service was excellent. Hence, two stars.

I was also surprised to see bourbon based drinks featured (for the season?). Given the current political and economic climate, I would expect that there are better options."}
{"text":"The charcuterie was so tasty! Raspberry jam mixed with fresh mozzarella, salted meats and mustard. Olives, pickles, tomatoes...it was tasty. Wish there were more cheese options on the plate.

Came back for dinner and had the best steak I've eaten in years! Everything was perfection so I up'd my stars"}
{"text":"Located in the Marriott at the Calgary Airport'

Good food. Also Gluten Free options 

I arrived on Tuesday and they just started with a new menu! 

Lots to choose from with things like Elk and smoking ice cream. 

I had the sirloin and it was cooked to perfection and sooo soft and tender! The potatoes were amazing and served in a different style (scalloped). And the veggies were good to, not over cooked and not under cooked. 

A must try for dinner if your at the airport for a while."}
{"text":"Beyond the excellent and friendly service and the nicely appointed decor, the food here is alright - nothing terribly exciting or bad.   

We ordered their burger and veggie flatbread pizza for our last meal in Calgary before boarding our plane.  While I thoroughly enjoyed my pizza (it's hard to go wrong with a basic cheese pizza topped with mushrooms and arugula) my husband wasn't so thrilled with his medium-cooked burger patty.   The kitchen unfortunately has a policy of only preparing burgers medium, which ruins in his book the best of all patties.  

So definitely this is middle of the road, balancing the good and bad.   I would still recommend this as an option if you're hanging around the airport as a nicer alternative than food court options."}
{"text":"We had the new menu. From it we ordered the sirloin steak. It came with yummy potatoes and lovely roasted vegetables. As this restaurant is at the airport we were quite surprised. If you have occasion to dine at the airport stop here first."}
{"text":"I was at the Calgary Airport getting ready to fly back to NJ.  I was dreading airplane food and fast food joints. We were there 3 hours early and we were looking to eat somewhere. 

The Calgary Airport has golf carts that drive people across the airport. I was a lil embrassed riding the golf cart.  When could have walked. Anywhoo,  and we passed the Marriot's Yakima Social resto and the driver mentioned it was a really good resto.  The menu was impressive. I had braised pork belly in a sweet soy sauce and a really great frisee and radish salad with wasabi dressing. Phil hd the salad and turkey sandwich. I was afraid I would to eat at TIm Horton or Tony Roma. Phew!!

Great selection of local beers and spirits, even if i didnt partake. They had Calgary gins like Park Gin and Parlour which by the way are NOT available in the Calgary Airport Duty Free store."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Order a hamburger and pizza. Each $18. Flavor ok but both very dry. Airport food  I was so hungry so had to eat it. The fries and beer were the best."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing. Open until 12am and opens at 5:30am. So really convenient!! My Karee burger ($16) was amazing. Best burger I've ever had. Hands down. Way better than the Gordon Ramsey burger I had in Vegas and better than the Romer burger's I've had in Vancouver. It has just the right amount of spiciness, sweetness, and crispiness. The patty to bun ratio was fabulous. A little bit messy to eat, but totally worth a bit. (SN: it doesn't pair really well with the big rock lager) 
Oh... and the wedged fries were really crispy too!! Will definitely come again! Oh... And both the server from Romania and the manager (?) were really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in every way. We had several meals here as we stayed at the Marriott at two different nights, the first and last night of our vacation. We couldn't wait to come back for our last dinner before we went home. 

Everything was delicious. We enjoyed great salads, sandwiches and scrumptious desserts. 

Carly, Kera, Amy and even Bruno the GM were all extremely warm and welcoming and provided us with great service at each meal we had. We seriously had Breakfast, Lunches and Dinners here. 

Cant beat the location either. It's just steps away from your gate at the airport. 

Enjoy your meal here. And don't forget to order the Warm Toffee Pudding or the Fried Cheesecake. Wow. It's a good thing I live far away or I'd be back again this weekend for more!"}
{"text":"The managers and staff were super friendly and gave great recommendations. My friend and I had the pulled elk sandwich with Sriracha mayo, on recommendation from the waitress, buttermilk flatbread and chocolate cake. Everything was delicious and decently priced."}
