{"text":"This place is unbelievable! We've tried pulled pork, beef brisket and beef ribs all over GTA and this place is hands down the best around. Will be coming here a lot more often to try more awesomeness from the menu! And their sauces are to die for!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out this new BBQ place. Went on a Saturday the week after they opened. Server was friendly, but it took forever to get our food even though the place was pretty much empty.  We tried the sampler (we chose BBQ Ribs, Smoked trout, Smoked balls of meat). Overall food was ok, but really overpriced. Ribs were pretty good. Smoked trout was acceptable. The smoked balls of meat were tiny and an absolute ripoff (basically $10 for 3 little meatballs).   We also asked to try their Apple Crumble dessert. That was pretty good although they did not have an ice cream machine yet so just didn't bother putting ice cream on it.  Overall not very impressed. Might go back again some time if they are still around in a few months. With these prices I have a feeling most people will smarten up and go elsewhere for their smoked bbq fix (big bone bbq for example)."}
{"text":"I have been to the one in Vaughan and Collingwood.  I enjoy the food but then again, I like smoked food.  I've had many different things but all have been good.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointment."}
{"text":"Fantastic smoked meat especially the beef brisket and the ribs. The staff is very friendly and the food came quick. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was top notch. Not only were the portions big, but the food tasted amazing. Great place to get dinner with a group of people. Our waiter was very kind, friendly and understanding of our situation. We came for the yelp event but, came 8 minutes before the chefs were calling it a day. She said we came just in time and was very acommodating of our situation.  Great atmosphere to the restaurant - with nice lighting, cool designs on the wall, and comfortable/spacious seating. I will definetly come back here if I'm in Vaughn."}
{"text":"Order the Yelp is HERE! And the Yelp Wrap is delicious!! (Saving that 31% is yummy too) Our party of 5 came on a Saturday night and luckily we arrived 10min before the kitchen closed (9:15-20). We were seated by a very friendly waitress.   All 5 of us got the Yelp wrap and we also got the poutine. I forget what it's called but it's the one that comes with their beef brisket.   The wraps were wonderful! Juicy and tender and went extremely well with the different sauces that every table gets (my favourites were the mustard and the vinegar one). The wraps also come with a TON of fries which is always nice. They were well made also.   The poutine was HUGE, and delicious. There was so much cheese and soooo much meattttt. Only one of us could finish our food (and he hadn't eaten in 14 hours), and we were all left full by the end of it. Definitely a great shareable in the poutine, loved it.   Service was also terrific! Our waitress was extremely accommodating, helpful, and super kind.   I think me and my friends will definitely be back and I'd definitely recommend this place, especially right now to go and try the specialty wrap! 5/5"}
{"text":"I've been to the Collingwood location 3 times and LOVED every minute of it. Naturally, hearing the news of a new Vaughan location, I was more than excited to go. Unfortunately, we went, it was unbelievably disapointing. To start, our table and the 5 or 6 bottles of sauce on the table were ridden with little flies. I didn't think there were flies in November, but there were, so many that we had to move to the other side of the restaurant. Anywhere else, I likely would have left. However, I was so excited for the food. Even bigger disapointment. Tried the bacon weaved loaf of meat, which, to more accurately describe it, was a slice or two of the overall loaf, which tasted more like a giant coldcut. The tiny portion of sweet potato fries were cold and rather old looking as well. To add to the lovely experience, our overpriced little cup of Mac and cheese was a 4/10 at best. The beans, maybe a 3 or 4/10. The burnt ends were also cold and full of fat. Very disappointing overall. Believe me when I say, I'm a major foodie who eats at restaurants more than once a day. There's few places I haven't been. I know what I'm talking about. To be honest I wouldn't feel right to even give them another chance. Or ever recommend it to anyone else for that matter. Sorry, TheSmoke, but you really made me furious that night. I was starving and so excited, didnt forsee myself going to eat elsewhere after leaving your location."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more. It's one of the few BBQ places with several vegetarian options and since my daughter is veg and my husband is flex, it's nice to have places with choices (and more than just one). BUT I kept comparing it to other BBQ places - Big Bone, Boneyard Grill, etc - and since I always have the same thing with BBQ - pulled pork, fries, beans and coleslaw - I found it lacking. Something was just off. The pork was watery, more mushy, not melt-in-your-mouth. I didn't like the sauce it comes with and ended up trying all the sauces until I settled on the one the chef doesn't recommend with the pulled pork. Hah. The coleslaw was good, the beans were not great and the fries were nothing special. My husband liked his ribs but not enough to want to go back. On the plus side, the service was very good and the restaurant is clean and inviting."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of ribs but these were disappointing. They weren't fall of the bones and rather dry. The wings were ok. Fries were good. Meh."}
{"text":"After finally visiting this place and the hype i had built up around it all i can say is...they knocked it out of the park!!! From the moment stepping in, the warm reception from our hostess who let us pick our seat, helped us with the menu and sauces. I got the rib and wing combo with fries and mac and cheese and added brisket and wild boar bacon. The ribs were perfectly smoked and the smoky sweet sauce complimented well. The wings were amazing as well, first smoked the finished on the grill. The brisket was so tender and melted in your mouth and the bacon was so fatty and good! The sides were great too, really crisp fries and very smooth and delicious mac and cheese with panko crumbs! I would definetely recommend and will be visit again!"}
{"text":"I first visited TheSmoke at their original Collingwood location after a long day on the slopes and discovered it as one of the highest reviewed spots in town due to it's recent feature on the Food Networks \"You Gotta Eat Here\". Fast forward to 2016/17 and they've brought their smokey, cheesy, beefy big flavours down south to Vaughan for everyone else to enjoy! Score!  I've only been once so before anyone flies off the handle with why only 4 stars and not 5 - it's because I have had only one menu item so far so I want to try a few more things before giving what I know will be an easy 5-star.   I stopped in for lunch with a friend and we decided to get a pair of sammys with fries as an easy option. I went with the W.B.B.B.B.B.S sandwich. So what the hell is that? A sandwich with 3 strips of Wild Boar Bacon, Back Bacon, Bacon with double smoked cheddar, Lettuce, Tomato, and Chipotle Mayo on a grilled Bun.  If you lost count that is 3 strips of 3 different kinds of bacon, which means you get a sandwich with 9 strips of bacon total. This was decadence incarnate and I happily ate it without breaking much for breathing.  As I mentioned earlier on, this is all I've had here to date, and I would love to try some of their crazy signature cocktails and their craft beer selection to go along with all the BBQ treats that I didn't get a chance to try.  Can't wait to go back again really soon and get smoked!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I went today for lunch ...it was unbelievable...i got the chef plate ..i believe that is what is called ..and it was amazing...great service..great place ..i can't wait to go there again..."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice.  The place is spacious but the table are a little too close.   We had the roast chicken and it was very dry.  You wouldn't expect that with smoking.  We also had the breakfast burger and the beef was also real dry.  Portions are small for the price.  It took forever for our food to arrive and then it wasn't really over the top.  Although I would return it wouldn't be a high priority.   They need to improve.  Also the continuous running of the You Gotta Eat Here episode is a little too much.  Put something else on the TV for patrons to watch."}
{"text":"We ordered the platter and everything on it was delicious! The brisket was juicy, the ribs were perfect but the unexpected star of the plate was the wings! It was tasty and juicy. Even the coleslaw was surprisingly good and the sweet potato fries were fried to perfection. The complimentary corn bread was a nice touch!"}
{"text":"We dropped in on a Saturday night and left knowing that we would be back again soon.   The BBQ platter was downright real-deal smokehouse taste. No cutting corners here. Smoky, flavorful hunks of meat cooked low and slow, then smothered in your choice of BBQ sauce and a crunchy fresh house-made slaw.   A really nice touch with the six varieties of sauces coupled with a pairing guide. It was simply delicious.   Don't stop what you're doing guys.. your food is delish!  We are looking forward to coming back.   Would have liked to have sampled the butter tarts, but they were all out. Judging by their photo, I'm not surprised."}
{"text":"My favorite place in both Collingwood and Vaughan Best burguers in the GTA hands down"}
{"text":"Very good Bbq place. Tried the chefs platter and everything was delicious. Brisket and pulled pork were moist. Ribs fall off the bone. Wings and sides were great as well. Enjoyed pairing the special Bbq sauces with the meats too. Will definitely return to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and I wanted a burger. My fiancé wanted some pulled pork so we figured this was the perfect place and oh were we correct. We liked the food so much we went back 4 days later. The food was incredible the sides were enormous and the service was splendid. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere as well. I had the Wholly Cow burger the first time and then the ribs the second. The burger was perfect, not greasy which I love, and the ribs literally fell off the rack. My fiancé had pulled pork with beans and the wild mushroom soup, and the second time she had a regular burger. Everything was amazing, I made sure to have her let me try some. This place was amazing, fair priced and a for sure go back to!!"}
{"text":"Located in the same plaza as McD, right off the highway, with ample parking and space inside for large groups. A nice view of the taller structures of Canada's Wonderland. Clean, bright & welcoming.   Walking in I noticed the show \"You Gotta Eat Here!\" was running, featuring BBQ foods to tease your appetite. I was thinking, man, if you're gonna show this to your customers, you better have a menu and a good chef to back it up!  I came here during the Order The Yelp event so I ordered the Yelp Wrap. It was packed with beef brisket, wrapped and pressed tightly. The brisket was juicy and I was happy with the portion. Lots of cheesy goodness in there too. The fries were nicely made. The plate was simply presented, no garnish, but also no complaints :)   They have 5 barbeque sauces provided at each table, with a comment card from the chef on what to pair them with. Studying this card makes for a good convo starter and sure takes away the pain of waiting. Just sampling these 5 sauces alone is fun & makes the visit worthwhile, I think. If you like 'em, you can purchase these sauces to bring home.   As I sat here longer, I realized -PSYCH!- The episode that was repeating on-screen was actually featuring the owner, Cam, who later on approached me to say hi :) I told him in awe \"wow you got to meet John Catucci\" and \"that is something to be proud of!\" He smiled and told me he was on Season 4 of the show about two years ago. You can see his showcase of trophies at the back. Cam demonstrated to me from our brief encounter that he's got a passion for ensuring his customers have an enjoyable time at his establishment. He's constantly learning from his customers.  Their slogan is \"Taking BBQ to a whole new level\", and that is something you can't fluke. I'll give them that, they know what they're doing. This time, I only got to sample a simple wrap. If I'm ever in the area again I'll be sure to revisit so I can try the rest of their menu. I'm confident it's one of those solid menus you can't really go wrong with!!"}
{"text":"We had recently stopped by for our first visit which was lunch, we were really looking forward to finally trying the food, since they don't allow take out and they've lost many business opportunities from us, we found the meats to be very dry, the salad (coleslaw) to be very soggy and the fried to be tasteless... We were really hoping for a much better experience... but if the food isn't good...? What can you do? But hope for better change?"}
{"text":"The tl;dr for this huge review is that when my tablemates asked me what I thought of my meal, I told them I'd rather go to Swiss Chalet.  Bright spots: the service was friendly and the potato salad was really good. The space was nice. The onion bread was tasty, although it's a tiny portion and you could make it at home in 10 minutes for about 20% of the price - but I digress.  Maybe I'm not digressing, actually. This place is way overpriced. One tiny loaf of sourdough with the onion butter? Five bucks. Half rack of ribs, $20. Poutine (regular poutine, not the specialty one with brisket and stuff)? $10. A side order (side order!) of mac and cheese will set you back about $8. I know Vaughan is expensive generally and this space is big, but seriously? Absurd.  The menu is ridiculous. Want a sampler platter for one? A couple slices of this and a scoop of that? No. You can pay almost $30 for a three-meat sampler (which, by the way, is 1/3 rack ribs and 6oz/each pulled pork and brisket). Do you want to order a sandwich with one meat and try a bit of something else? Nope. If you ask, they might be able to do this, but I've really never seen a barbecue place that doesn't serve food in this way to begin with. You're clearly supposed to order one of their constructed plates.  The portions are not large. The half rack of ribs was one of the smallest I've ever seen. It was about as much meat as a 1/3-rack portion at Swiss Chalet. I mention SC again because after eating these ribs, my immediate reaction was that it's both more flavorful and a better value than The Smoke. I got the smokin' hot sauce and it tasted almost exactly like the Swiss Chalet rib sauce, but with a weaker flavor and the absolute teensiest bit of spice. It was kind of funny that this is the \"\"spicier\"\" sauce, because I'm pretty sure someone just whispered \"Tabasco\" over the molasses-based sauce before serving and called it hot.  With this dinky portion of ribs, I chose coleslaw and potato salad as my sides. The potato salad was, as I said, really good. Nice creamy dressing, smooth flavor, touch of white wine really works. This was the best thing I ate. The coleslaw was horrible, and I'm not even sure why - it just had this weird, smoky, burnt-caraway-seed tasting edge.  The slaw, however, was not the worst thing I ate. This was a 2-star review until I took a bite of one of my table's appetizers - the meatballs. Holy god, this was one of the worst things I've ever tasted in my life. It was absolutely repulsive. It tasted like they had scraped the bottom of the smoker after preparing their stock for the day and then shaped that into a ball. I went back to eating coleslaw to get the taste out of my mouth.  Despite the ribs, onion bread, and potato salad, I cannot write a review that says \"this restaurant served me one of the worst things I've ever tasted, 2/5\". I know people like this place, but I clearly don't get it."}
{"text":"I ordered the sampler so I could try a few things.  The ribs weren't very good at all, laden with fat but, but the spicy sauce was very good. 2.5/5 The coleslaw met the garbage, purple cabbage if you are a fan but just not tasty. 1/5 Some sort of chicken chowder 4/5 Burger was tasty but too plain and under seasoned 3/5 Smoked trout was decent but nothing to get excited about unless on that chicken and fish diet, lol 3/5  Overall not a great experience, I will be back to try the smoked meat next Friday!!   Update: It is now friday and I called to get the smoked meat sandwich only to be told they dont do take out anymore...ummm okay, I asked if I can just come in and order it and take it home, she said no, dine in only....lol, I know she couldnt stop me from walking out with it but this is a joke especially when we have superior places like Centre Street Deli and the Corn Beef House within driving distance.  Ill never be back at this joke but I do encourage everyone to give the trout a try if you are eating healthy"}
{"text":"This is just another scarce but incredible example of BBQ done right!  I'm always looking for places to try in this neck of the woods and I'm glad I stumbled onto The Smoke-several times!  There are great daily specials in addition to a regular menu. My fave go to keeps popping up as the sampler platter with ribs, brisket and pulled pork. I keep taking part of the meal home, both because it's a big portion, but also so I can spread out the enjoyment over a couple of days.   Unlike many BBQ joints, this place is. If, so you have a good chance of getting a table. So get a table already!!  UPDATE: OK, upgrade to top marks here. I can't recall having better back ribs anywhere in North America. So sorry I only ordered half a rack-I could have had 4 racks!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for a LONG time however the word of mouth was sort of tepid and Yelp reviews were hit and miss so I figured I'd give this place a few months to get over the opening jitters.  Finally the stars aligned and I decided it was high time to see for myself if this place was any good.  First off the service was super friendly and ultra fast. I loved the decor of the place and it was surprisingly big. Love the addition of the new patio.  Secondly, the food was killer. I ordered the standard brisket on a bun with drunken onions/mushrooms and got a side of the potato salad. Just perfect. Both were simple, you could see they highlighted the product itself and kept it fairly simple. The brisket was incredibly tender and super flavorful, and the bun was soft yet sturdy against the juices.  I love that they allow you to add your own sauces, all of which are tasty and unique. I hate too much bbq sauce on things like pulled pork sandwiches so this was a big bonus for me.  Potato salad was cold, fresh and superb and while I was initially wary of the dollop of cranberry citris aioli in top, it really does bring the whole dish together and elevates it without being overbearing.  Wife had the brisket poutine and loved it tho thought the bernaise on top may have been a bit much. Fries were KILLER though.  I know this place has struggled to find its footing but i'm hoping this is a sign that it's smooth sailing from here on out. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Our one visit to The Smoke was a bit lack luster.   I tried the Smoked French Onion Beef sandwich from the lunch menu.  The bread ran a bit soggy while the beef, cheese and onions were quite salty so I found I had to use more hot sauce and creole mustard sauce to balance this item. The side of mac and cheese was good though; creamy, rich and the panko crumbs baked on top finished it well.   We also had the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. The pulled pork portion was very meaty and generous though was comparably a bit bland - nothing a bit of bbq sauce couldn't fix. The fries were cooked well, crispy and not greasy and a good portion size accompaniment.  I'd consider returning for their weekend specials or their challenge burger (1 lb of fries, 4x8oz burger patties, cheese, bacon and standard toppings - free if done under 10 minutes, otherwise 1/2 off if done under 20 minutes or $29.99) to either fame or shame myself on their board of participants, but overall wasn't too blown away by The Smoke."}
{"text":"Food is below average. Have been there a couple of times and was disappointed every time. All the meats taste the same and are very bland and pretty much tasteless. Only redeeming factor is the beer that they serve. Service is also very good but probably because the place is empty most of the time."}
{"text":"I call this the shpritz bbq place.  They give you 4 different sauces in bottles.  Its Meh.  The ribs lack flavor and smoking.  They need a shpritz sauce with them.  Burger is interesting, pink in the middle.  I'm not a fan of  it.  The restaurant is cool.  Service was fine.   I've been to the one in collingwood.  Its better in Collingwood only because there is not much better around that area.    Overall, its ok.  Without the shpritz sauces they give to you shpritz your food with it would be a 2 star.  I found myself constantly shrpritzing the breast of chicken just to finish. Rather the shpritz be there before and get infused and sticky.  That's what bbq is all about.  Messy and sticky."}
{"text":"I loved The Smoke in Collingwood. It was the go-to place after we're famished from being on the slopes all day snowboarding at Blue Mountain.  When I heard news of The Smoke opening in Vaughan I was so excited. I subscribed to their newsletter and followed up on their opening and construction.   Yesterday evening my boyfriend and I invited 4 of our closest friends to try out the amazing bbq that is The Smoke.   I am so, so sorry to say that it was nothing like The Smoke in Collingwood. It made me really sad.   We ordered 3 bbq platters for the 6 of us. It was just not enough food, we were still so hungry afterwards (three normal sized dudes, two very petite women, 1 larger dude). We went to Demetres and had a whole lot of dessert afterwards...  Beef brisket, although tender, came out cold like it was sitting on the counter for a while. The fat of the brisket was so cold it was turning waxy. It was 7pm on a Thursday evening, so I'm not sure why the brisket was cold...  Ribs, we ordered 3 sets in different sauces but no one explained to us which sauce was on which set of ribs. The ribs were not fall off the bone and were lukewarm (but not as cold as the beef brisket)... We had to kind of chew the meat off the bone, it wasn't fall-off-the-bone.  Buffalo Thighs, came out cold. The sauce was actually refrigerator frigid. Chicken thighs were really dry, I didn't know chicken thighs could be dry!   Bacon Meatloaf, was dry and crumbly and also lukewarm.  The chilli came out warm which is good. The coleslaw was OK. The cornbread was really small and underwhelming....  It was really odd because the food at their Collingwood location was always pretty spot on. I'm shocked that at their Vaughan location the food is so lacking in comparison. My guests won't go back again but I really want to give it another chance, maybe in a month or two when they get their food sorted out."}
{"text":"Great place for your BBQ needs, wants and cravings. The staff was truly very accommodating, friendly and helpful . The meals were wonderful. All our friends enjoyed the atmosphere and ambience . My only quip was the fact that all our fries had way too much salt. Everything else was awesome!!! Thank you"}
{"text":"Went here since it was close and it was definitely a good decision. Customer service is excellent and the yelp special was amazing. It was cheesy and had enough meat for a meat lover like myself. The place is very comfortable and more people should definitely go here. No wait time at all."}
{"text":"My friends and I are a big fan of The Smoke in Collingwood. After a few hours of snowboarding, it's great to kick back with a beer and ribs. The waitress had mentioned to us last year they were opening a new location in Vaughan. We were very excited.  Ordered pulled pork, ribs/wings combo and a rootbeer float (contain alcohol).  The pulled pork was good, almost exactly the same as the one in Collingwood. It's sauced up with their bbq sauce (the blue sauce). The portion was smaller then at the other location though. Not sure if that's the norm.  The cornbread is not the same as the other one, it's usually a bit spicy which gives it a nice balance from the sweetness - but this one did not have that at all. It was a bit disappointing.  The wings were great! Really like them! very flavourful!  The ribs were o-k. Didn't taste like it has been smoked. Did not fall-off-the-bone like at the other location. It was also a bit dry. =(   Room for improvement. And please do so, because i'm such a huge fan of the Collingwood location so I know it's possible.   Oh yeah, the service was good + quick and our waitress checked in with us frequently so that's the same as the other location."}
{"text":"First impression walking in was that the place is very nice, clean, and spacious. The well lit area makes dining very comfortable and not only that but our server and the service in general was amazing. Our server gave us a sample of the cornbread and made honest recommendations that really assisted in the excellent experience we had. Our food came very quickly and tasted great! Would recommend the baked beans and leafy garden salad as they tasted amazing. Also be sure to try the sauces they provide on your table because they are a great addition to whatever meal you have! Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I've been to plenty of BBQ joints from big bone to carbon bar in Toronto and many all over the gta. I came in within 2 weeks of this place opening and was greeted by a friendly server who brought us to our table with menus. She was so nice and helpful with all our questions and took the time to answer them.   We had ordered the pulled pork and ribs and both were great, the pulled pork sandwich was so tender and juicy and the ribs were literally fall off the bone, melt in your mouth. I love the fact that they have different sauces you can try on your table all colour organized. Overall, this is an amazing spot for fresh, house smoked BBQ in the GTA. Definitely will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately, some food items fell flat. Service was great....we were greeted by the hostess as soon as we entered and shown to a table. Our server was over shortly thereafter,  took our drink order and when she returned (with corn bread) she asked if we were ready to order. I can't speak to others food (at my table...there were 4 of us in total) but my meal was \"meh\". I ordered the pulled pork, with baked beans and mac n' cheese as my sides. The pulled pork was pretty bland. I added one of the sauces and it helped a bit, but it still was pretty bland. Cooked perfectly though. The baked beans were passable...way too saucy for my liking. They were flavourful..just way too much sauce. The Mac n'cheese was dreadful. It wasn't cheesy at all and was way too watered down.....it was perhaps the worst that I've ever had at a restaurant. It was if they added food colouring to water, poured it over some pasta, threw some panko crumbs and called it Mac n' cheese. Downright awful and the biggest disappointment on my plate. So.....in summary. Friendly staff, plenty of tables, so-so food. I'll go back to try something else....but won't order the same dish or sides."}
{"text":"I eat frequently at the smoke.  It is a fantastic place to go.  Lots of seating, very clean, friendly staff, and great music from the 70s playing in the background.  I found this place through another friend who bragged about how good the food was.  He was right.  I am a regular here now.  The thing I enjoy most about The Smoke is the variety of food: ribs, burgers, wings, sandwiches, soups, and a really authentic variety of options.  Cam is the chef and has a very good grip on what flavours go well together and honestly what just works.  Bucking the trend of making more of what everyone else does, he has come up with a very unique expression of his creativity through his food.  Whether it is a brisket, pulled pork, wild boar bacon or smoked iced cream, there is always a unique slant on what you are being served, and it's darned fine eatin'   The place is always clean.  The staff is very energetic and striving to make sure that every visit is consistent.   I must eat a gluten free diet.  This is what makes this place that much better is that I can eat so many different things here that are made gluten free.  One of a kind!"}
{"text":"Too pricey for the amount of food they serve. Ribs is hard to eat, meatloaf is dry and the 6oz beef brisket for some reason is bit and pieces, unlike what is shown on the picture menu, it supposed to be sliced.  Burger patty is too dry. Macaroni and cheese had too much panko crumbs and didn't suit my taste. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Looking for something at lunch time close to home.  This is brand new place and never been to this chain before.  We went in and were the only customers inside.  The staff was sitting at a table in the corner playing on their cell phones.  (seriously) Server seated us with menus and returned in 3 minutes to take orders with pen and pad in hand.  Made zero introductions or suggestions. She didn't ask if we'd been to a SmokeBBQ before.  I was still dazed from the high prices of simple items like a BLT sandwich,  or to add chicken to a salad is extra $8.  Wow!   I picked an appetizer chicken wings, and my friend got a side dish of macaroni&cheese.  Both were disappointing.  Came to table with simply 8 wings on a dish, looked like it just came out of   a microwave.  Not even a carrot, or a sprig of parsley for presentation.  The pasta that cost $8.00 was served in a small ramekin dish like a dessert,and was over cooked penne pasta.  We only had water and the bill came to $23.   I won't go back ever, and regret that visit to try it out.   Sorry SmokeBBQ, but you're a miss."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmm! Loved every. Single. Bite.   I visited TheSmoke on my lunch break with some colleagues and honestly wished I ordered take out for dinner that night. It was so friggen good.   I had the open faced onion beef cheese thing. Can't remember what it was called because I was so distracted by its contents. I ordered a side Caesar; the dressing tasted home made. Potent amount of garlic, my fave kind of dressing.   The sandwich was unreal. Juicy beef brisket, gooey smoked cheese, drunken onions and mushrooms piled high on a sourdough slice. I asked for beef gravy on the side to make my own little beef dip thing - so much goodness on a plate.   Next time I come here I'm going to try the smoked trout, Mac and cheese and probably a sampler plate. I would not mind giving their cornbread a go either. Fairly priced and alright service.   Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We ordered the mixed platter between 3 adults and two young kids and still had a pile of food left over. The variety was terrific and the meat delicious. My only disappointment with dinner was the dessert. The apple crumble is delicious but really needs a cream of sorts to cut it. Strange they don't include their homemade ice cream in the order. We will go back."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp decided to try it out great environment lots of comfortable seating. Staff very friendly. And that was only the beginning the share platter which features the ribs pulled pork and brisket is worth it and you've got to try the baked beans yummy. Washed it down with a barking squirrel beer and I was done. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Obviously this place is getting better from what others posted. The meatery combo had ribs, brisket and pulled pork along with a choice of 2 sides. Wow the brisket is excellent. You get a choice of table side bottles of 5 different sauces. Next time just the brisket as this was too much food. Lol. Enjoy. Great place."}
{"text":"Sat down for lunch on a Friday. Cool atmosphere and prompt service. Had the Friday feature Montreal smoked meat sandwich with fries. I've had Montreal smoked meat sandwiches all over Toronto and Montreal (Schwartz's) and this sandwich was one of the best I've had. Great flavour, good portion and great bread choice. My server was really friendly and checked in several times. Definitely recommend the Montreal smoked meat and will be back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Been a couple of times no, had the Brisket the first time and went on Rib night (Wednesdays). Great food and great selection of sauces on the table to add to your food. Their fries are aweome too!"}
{"text":"We had the Poutine burger, balls of meat, brisket, ribs, meat loaf, beans, cole slaw and mac & cheese.  All were delicious.   The best however was the smoked apple crisp."}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW. Been to this place 2 times already, and REALLY want to go again. This is a BBQ fans dream, where you can stuff your face in pounds of meat and have a legitimate food baby once you're done. I ordered the Cows Meat Pig Sandwich because it sounded amazing and IT WAS! It had a pile of pulled pork, coleslaw topped with amazing sauces (Carolina mustard & Hot Vinegar) with a side order of beans that were already good enough. To make it even better, they also have 6 special sauces (colour-coded) to further enhance the flavours of whatever you are having. PRO TIP: just mix all of them, it's really good.  Only problem, which is for them not anyone eating there, is that they are located in a... whatever plaza... with legit NOTHING at that plaza, no foot traffic, which really shows inside the restaurant (both times I went were peak lunch times and NO one is in the restaurant)  This place was on Food Network's 'You Gotta Eat Here!' and I do hope that more people come to this place because it's fantastic."}
{"text":"The first time I went to the Vaughan location I was beyond impressed with the pulled pork and beans and fries. I went back and got the pulled pork and 2 sides... the baked beans and coleslaw and my kids got the ribs and fries and baked beans.  It was a Friday afternoon.  The Montreal Smoked Meat was already sold out.  It was only 12:30pm The owner or manager was sitting at a huge party table by himself calculating whatever. The food was so bad.  We all couldn't handle it!  Soggy fries.  The fries were under the ribs.  Full rack of ribs looked like it was 1/2 rack divided ip between 2 boys and my pulled pork tallied over $80 with taxes and drinks.  WTF!  NO COMPASSION.  Evetyone looked at our crap on the plates and there was no smoke.  Everything was cold and soggy!  NO REFUND OR CREDIT... NOTHING.  We could've walked out.  Instead we watched over and over your feature on YOU GOTTA EAT HERE!  BS!  Don't eat here.  It sucks.  The guy was too busy to see us.  Right.  The girl is the only server in the afternoons.  Your chefs don't give 2 sh*ts about the customers.  Altering your menu shows you are hurting!  Shameful business practices.  You will run your business to the ground!  Perhaps, that is your goal.  Keep it up.  It will happen. I waited for 40 minutes and then the girl gave me... THE BILL!  IN FULL.  WTF I could've left.  The place was empty.  I was being honest and gave a chance.  You guys took it as a joke. Too bad.  Now, pay the consequences"}
{"text":"So I live nearby here and I've seen it since it opened but never really had an interest in trying it since there is a very well known local favorite in the Woodbridge area. I finally decided to give it a shot since they mentioned they were featured on one of my favorite shows.  I came on a Wednesday and to my luck, the daily special was $3 off the rib meals. They also had half price bottles of wine which I would totally get normally but not right after working out. I get the half rack meal at first which is 19.99 with the deal but decided to just pay $5 more for a full rack. It also came with 2 regular sides which I opted for double fries.  The first half of my ribs was absolutely delicious and tender. Lots of flavour which just penetrates to the bone. The second half, the bigger half of the rack, was not as great. The flavour was still there but because there was more meat, the flavours didn't get in deep enough. I also found the thicker side to be pretty dry which required me to wash it down with water. The fries were pretty standard, but they weren't crispy which is okay for this meal.  The service was super friendly and very on point. My server often came to check in on me and also made sure my cup of water was never empty. The environment is very nice and totally what you would imagine a BBQ restaurant that's more modern to look like.  This is a strong number 2 for me in the local area. What would make me pick this over my typical fav is that there is a happy hour special for all kinds of drinks including beer and ciders between 3-5 (I think) and the special on wine bottles for Wednesdays."}
{"text":"I came here during the \"Order the Yelp\" event and ordered the Yelp Wrap, which is a smoked beef brisket with cheese in a wrap and comes with a side of fries. The wrap was packed with tender, succulent beef. There were several pieces of fat, so you have to be careful with what you eat. The fries were on the soggy side. The owner came by to see how things were going. I was the first to order the Yelp wrap.  I also tried some of the pulled pork sandwich. On the first few bites, sauce just drips out of the sandwich. The pork was moist on every bite except when you get closer to the middle of the sandwich, where I thought it was a little dry. Overall, though, it as an excellent pulled pork sandwich.  Of the few barbeque restaurants in the area that I have tried, I liked TheSmoke the most."}
{"text":"Second time I have been here. It's a really cool looking place on the inside. I had the pulled pork sandwich with slaw this time and it was delicious. I recommend this place if you like pulled pork and ribs, etc. Not too sure why it isn't that busy whenever we come in but more people should try it!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner this past weekend with 19 others for my boyfriends birthday. The food was great. I got the cow meets pig sandwich with fries and a side of gravy this time and I've shared the smoke sampler in the past.. both really good but the gravy is phenomenal!! Do not order the fries without it on the side.. too good to miss!! The waitstaff was very friendly and very organized. They had no issues giving separate bills even though we were a large group. They brought him a special dessert at the end. Come try this place :)"}
