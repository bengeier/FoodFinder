{"text":"I eat here about 3 times a week as it is close to work and is so fresh and delicious! There are a ton of options and you can really tell that the owner is passionate about what he does. The menu may seem daunting at first but the owner and his staff are always ready to help out. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is a D grade pita joint. It's certainly edible, but does not compete with other franchises. We ordered two pitas to go with a bunch of different veggie options. When we got home we found that the pitas were mostly roman lettuce.  Not a lot pita options in the area, but I won't be going back. If I want a lettuce wrap for 11 dollars I'll make it at home. -E"}
{"text":"Huge amount of pita options  Pretty quick service  Can cater to any taste  Close to Stanley and Trinity Bellwood's park"}
{"text":"This place was a Pita Pit for a long time. Then I walked in there to find the look had changed a bit but the same people were working there.  The menu had a lot more choices then previously but I'm a creature of habit so I ordered a chicken pita like I always do. They sell pastries now as well.  It had the same toppings but there was way more meat and veggies in it than I was when it was Pita Pit.  If you like Pita Pit you'll like this place better.   It's clean and it's quick........this gets five stars from me."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fresh products, good food, great result! Good place to go after everything else has closed!"}
{"text":"I love Pita Choice!  It's literally my first choice when I don't bring a lunch to work.  The owner is extremely friendly and knowledgeable, telling you other choices you might like for next time.  They have a HUGE variety of pitas and salads with lots of veggie options and it's also inexpensive and healthy which makes it a winner in my books."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong. Delicious, fresh ingredients at great prices.   I always go with the steak wrap."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be a Pita Pit, but branched out on its own last year and became Pita Choice. The menu is similar but expanded to include lots of vegetarian choices and they offer some homemade Greek-style baked goods which are displayed up front. Think of it as an upgrade from Pita Pit. The place was also renovated to make it more warm and welcoming, though I usually get my pitas to go. I have been going here regularly and the manager is still there and is always friendly and making my pita just how I like it."}
