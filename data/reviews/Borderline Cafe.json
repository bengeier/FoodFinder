{"text":"Solid Southwest influenced fare for a fair price."}
{"text":"This place has, hands down, some of the best breakfast food I've had anywhere. The menu/food is definitely 5++ stars quality, but the overall rating is tempered by the small space/long wait that you may have to deal with (anytime past 9:30 on weekends), temperamental hours, no liquor license for that mimosa/bloody mary you may want for Sunday brunch and the super-old/filmy plastic glasses they use for water. The service is very friendly, but you're going to wait for the breakfast goodness -- once it arrives, it is heaven! The best home fries ever, the perfect blend of crispy fried on the outside, soft on the inside, with just the right seasoning (I'm pretty sure smoked paprika is involved, but who knows) -- the stuffed french toast is also TDF, as well as the southwestern flair that sets the place apart from the ordinary greasy spoon. Show up early, beat the line and bring friends to share dishes so you can get both the savory and sweet dishes!"}
{"text":"2-3 years had passed since my last visit and thankfully everything is still delicious. Prices are great, service is great. I really wish they had an east side location."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, service ... well worth waiting for! The short stack blueberry pancakes were great as well as steak sliders. When i go back plan on eggs benedict on fresh layer of guac!"}
{"text":"Boo. We went with two kids and told we wouldn't be able to eat there together.  This info came to us after waiting for 15 minutes."}
{"text":"The Food was terrific!! Purchased the smoke sausage omelet ant that's all she wrote. Server was friendly and made me feel right at home. I highly recommend..don't let the small size of this place fool you.  Portion size was more than enough...did I mention the home fries! Yummy and seasoned just right!"}
{"text":"I LOVE breakfast sandwiches. I don't know what it is but I just can't get enough.  Their borderline wrap is great - it's scrambled eggs, cheese and your choice of meat wrapped in a tortilla and served with salsa. I substitute breakfast potatoes for the chips (who eats chips, anyway?) and always leave so satisfied. It's a pretty small place so try to time your arrival either early or late to miss the crowd."}
{"text":"Great food and the service was awesome. The only downside was that I wish the menu was a little more extensive. But besides that, it's a great spot to catch some breakfast!"}
{"text":"One of my ultimate favorite breakfast places! Small restaurant, and you will probably have to wait if you go on a weekend. But it will be worth it! Everything I've had here is amazing!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed- really awkward cramped seating. I don't enjoy staring at a wall when i eat.  Nice staff, but food was nothing i wouldnt make myself"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh.  Breakfast does not get much better than Borderline.  Just thinking about it sends me into a carbohydrate craving, and generic breakfast alternatives like Bob Evans and Perkins are deeply depressing in comparison.  Stuffed French toast -- amazing Trail mix pancakes -- amazing Omelettes -- amazing  I've also had some fruit salads that have been very good.  The hours are my only complaint.  If they were open seven, or even five, days a week, and operated into the later afternoon, I would be much happier.  Though I suppose all the waiting and anticipation for them to be open (and often, just to get in the door once they are open) makes it even sweeter to sit down for a meal there."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast/Brunch in Lakewood!! My favorites are the \"Smack your A** Chorizo Tacos\" and \"Stuffed Banana Nut french toast\"  Friendly Service, Delicious food, and not expensive!! Completely affordable. There is usually a bit of a line but it moves quickly and is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Walked in and I was greeted by the waitress who said to me \"there is no room\" and she walked away. Didn't suggest we wait, maybe come back in 10 minutes. Nothing. Yes the place is small but who Treats potential customers like that. That was my first and last experience there."}
{"text":"This place is incredible, me and my husband got in love with the food and the attention, the place is tiny but cozy. The most popular dish is the avocado toast, delicious. The only bad thing is that you have to pay in cash.   I love going to these type of businesses were they have different options and they create plates using good ingredients."}
{"text":"Our go-to breakfast place! We prefer to eat at restaurants that are not a chain- and this is a fabulous place to eat breakfast Wednesday thru Sunday. Bring cash as they do not take plastic. The restaurant is small and cozy. Expect a line on the weekends but it moves pretty quick. The food is always good and fresh. They have a great selection and have plenty of vegetarian items. I love the veggie quesadilla and the southwestern omelette. Make sure you order the homefries/potatoes, they're the bomb!"}
{"text":"Everyone else can brag on the food.  What really makes this place shine for me is the cosy, intimate atmosphere.  You feel like you're dining with friends and family.  Kelly is a hoot and does her best to get to everyone in perfect order.  Don't come here if you don't want a 'social dining experience'.  Don't come here if you are in a hurry.  Come here to chow on superior breakfast and lunch items with old and new friends.  And, eat, enjoy and get out because there's usually someone waiting to take your place."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and fast service. Definitely a keeper in the list of places in Lakewood."}
{"text":"Breakfast is good 9x out of 10. Service is usually very good. The only cash payment thing is a pain."}
{"text":"I love the place and atmosphere. The service is lackluster, but who cares when the food is so fresh and delicious. Also, don't forget they only take cash payments."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place! Walked up there got in right away and just enough food to fill you up but not uncomfortable. Got the bacon avocado Benedict was great.. Loved the cilantro lime sauce"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Borderline cafe is a must go to place!! This place is definitely worth going to the ATM.  Next, the service was on par. Kelly, the only waitress working, did an excellent job. She catered to our every needs flawlessly, topping off our coffee and water without being asked to, and making us feel right at home while we waited for our food. She was the only one waitress and she killed it!  For being a hole in the wall place, Borderline Cafe delivers 5 star service, quality, and expectations. It is hands down one of our favorite breakfast places we've been to in cleveland by far!    Southwestern Omelette and Pumpkin Cream Stuffed French Toast: The omelette was light and thin. It had the perfect amount of cheese and sour cream. I loved the salsa that came with it. The pumpkin french toast was the special for the day. They were amazing! The pumpkin cream was perfect and the candied pecans were nice addition.   I had the Huevos Rancheros Verdes:  It was \"¡muy delicioso!\" The green salsa is very good and the over medium eggs cooked just right! The atmosphere was very welcoming and our server was one of the best I've had in a long time.  I had the Chorizo Burrito: First and foremost, the presentation was amazing for a $6 burrito. If you like good first impressions, this is the place to be at. Ok, not only is it appealing to the eyes, it's appealing and mighty delicious to the taste as well. The two sauces sprinkled on it was awesome! Not sure if they were homemade or not.   I ordered the stuffed French toast and it is THE best I've ever hard with the perfect portion size. Just enough for me and for the rest of breakfast club to have a taste. Kelly is such a great waitress who is prompt with coffee and so courteous!! Love this place!  Bacon Avocado Eggs Benedict: This is the specialty, for good reason.  There is perfect amounts of avocado to quietly compliment the poached egg and bacon.  The hollandaise sauce was superb, which is very easy to mess up.  It wasn't too thick or runny.  It does not look like a large serving as first, but quickly filled me up.  I definitely recommend this dish to any and everyone...something different to have for breakfast but totally worth it!  There is a reason our breakfast club has been to this place twice...it is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Everything I've ever gotten here has been delicious, including the old breakfast standards.  Great staff, friendly and personable."}
{"text":"Read a bunch of good reviews so we decided to check it out. It was small, felt like we were right on top of each other. No music, which I like to create a vibe. So it was just talking. That's just my personal preference, others may not mind this at all. Servers were both friendly and good to us. Ordered the Bacon benedict and Chorizo tacos. They were good. Nothing crazy. Came with a side of fruit, no home fries or any other type of side. You could probably order it, but most places would have something to go with it, I think. It wasn't bad at all, but for the reviews I thought it would be knock-out. I'd go back but it wouldn't be my first choice. I gave it 3 stars because it was just about average."}
{"text":"This was my first time there. It was busy, and service was friendly, though slow. I was prepared for this by other reviews, and the waitress was unruffled and greeted us, so I didn't mind. The food was delicious. I had scrambled cheesy eggs with Itlian bread toast and the best hashbrowns I have had since working at a restaurant in Texas. I recommend this for a leisurely breakfast. I would bring guests from out of town for a little something different, as their menu is creative and well executed!"}
{"text":"Totally worth the Hype!  When my wife and I moved to Rocky River I had a very difficult time (and still do) with all of the old ladies who wear ankle length fur coats to the grocery store in July just so people know they have money, and the stay at home moms who drive 300K Mercedes to pick up a moca frap at Starbucks. I literally want to wear their skin as a unitard....   So when our new neighbor, a middle aged mullet sporting lesbian who reminded my more of Larry the cable guy than than some turd polishing over-privileged suburbanite moved in I  though to my self...now we are getting somewhere! This will be interesting.   She would keep Nattie Lite on ice in a cooler on the back porch (although we live a very nice Duplex with a working fridge) She would  strike up conversations with me about how hot the neighbor's girlfriend was, if I saw the Browns game or the most recent episode of the L Word (which I totally had) It was kind of like living in the same house with lady Gribble.  Now we tired a few of Laura the Cable Guy's suggestions early on and they were hit and miss...specifically Minerva's (review on that joint to follow) but the one place we never tied until recently was the Borderline Cafe'  I wish we had years ago!  When it comes to breakfast I am a really though customer. Although I am huge foodie, my mom (God rest her soul) was a Kentucky Hillbilly and any one who had parents from the south knows that breakfast is almost a religion unto itself in that part of the country.  Comparing the two is a little bit like comparing apples and oranges (at least the meal I chose) but this place has the best breakfast I have ever had not cooked by my mother. Granted I did not get Biscuits and Gravy (but I will next time and really put them to the test)  I was in the mood for something with a twist for breakfast,. Their breakfast sliders hit the nail on the head. Crispy steak(ums) served with American cheese, onions and Chipotle Mayo served on a butter grilled bun BANG! Total Food CHUB!  The home fries were also excellent. Not the traditional type you wold expect at from Denny's or IHOP. These were kicked up a notch. Sliced very thin like Latkes, and fried crispy with parsley and some other spices. I did not need Ketchup...which is beyond bragable-  The people there are real people.The joint seemed yuppy free and I believe the 1%ers from River are afraid to cross the  border and sully their boat shoes with the  filth of commoners so I doubt you run into those types there.  Good people, great service AMAZING food  *****The only reason I did not give this place five stars was.... It is called The Borderline Cafe' and I was really, really hoping for some sort of cappuccino or espresso drink with breakfast... if they rectify this It just might be the greatest breakfast experience on earth that is not some sort of Man Vs. Food challenge*****"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast food especially the burritos. Bring cash and be prepared for a bit of a wait, which is usually not too bad and well worth it. Try the chorizo in something."}
{"text":"The food NEVER disappoints! Always order a meal and now we get a side of pancakes as well because it is too hard to choose. Had a omelet for the first time and it was awesome....go western!! Very busy on the weekends so go early!"}
{"text":"easiest 5 stars I could ever give. the food, the atmosphere, the staff, the prices, all great. give this place a try ASAP but remember it's cash only. get the breakfast quesadilla and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great little place. Service was friendly and attentive. The Bacon Avocado Benedict was delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times.  I really like this place. The good is good and the sisters who own it are fabulous. It's a CASH ONLY restaurant. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Anything ordered with the chorizo is awesome. Have already been here and back over a dozen times and have not once had an issue with either the food or service. I find  myself sticking to my usual order of a southwestern omelette with chorizo..but I think it's time to venture out and try the other items offered. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Get there early because the longer you wait the longer the line is out the door. The chorizo tacos are yummy and go for a side of breakfast potatoes. Don't forget to bring cash."}
{"text":"We just enjoyed the hue is rancheros verde! Great coffee, too. Friendly staff and fair prices."}
{"text":"Are you KIDDING ME! So sweet with charm, food so good...like being at yer BFFs house. The friendliest staff I've ever encountered, so genuine too :) Don't be a dummy: CA$H ONLY PEOPLE"}
{"text":"THE place to go for breakfast. The bacon avacado Benedicts are perfect every time! The stuffed French toast is also delicious. My only recommendation is they need better coffee."}
{"text":"Cute place.  The food was awesome, and our waitress was friendly.  I would give more stars if they took credit cards and had a website.  Those two things are normally enough for me to refuse to even try a place, but I'm glad I went and would probably go back."}
{"text":"Haven't been on Yelp in god knows how long...sad!!! Maybe it's because I haven't been anywhere new lately and have begun working full-time again (double sad!).   But I went back to Borderline today and had the famous Bacon-Avocado Benedict. AMAZING! I have never tasted hollandaise so divine. The waitress even told me that she served some folks from Pittsburgh who routinely make the drive JUST for this dish. Insane, but I understand. The cilantro puts it over the edge of awesomeness. Just try it."}
{"text":"I have been waiting a long time to try this place! Everyone who lives in Lakewood seems to recommend it as well as most yelpers and now I know why! It is delicious! This is not at all your average diner. This place focuses on southwest breakfast foods.   I came here on a Friday morning around 9:30am with 2 other people and even that early in the morning we waited about 20 min for a table. The coffee is good, the sauces are homemade and the service is quick. I ordered the Chorizo tacos and I loved that the Chorizo was cooked in with the eggs. Our table also ordered the stuffed banana walnut french toast and the Chorizo burrito. Everything was delicious!   This is a must try Lakewood staple!"}
{"text":"DOWNSIDE: It's cash-only, so make sure you visit an ATM first. UPSIDE: Everything else, but let me focus on the waitresses... This was the first restaurant I visited since I went to the ER three weeks earlier for what turned out to be two major flare-ups of something called diverticulitis. This was my first attempt at ordering food in my newly restricted diet (no nuts or anything with seeds). I mentioned the diverticulitis in passing to our waitress and she said her mom had the same thing, so she was able to help me navigate their menu as far as what I could and could not eat. Another waitress overheard this and pointed out what else I had to watch out for, such as the home made guacamole having bits of tomatoes in it (again, seeds). I ended up getting the breakfast sliders, which I shared with my husband. Very good people work here."}
{"text":"A great little breakfast spot. Very small so expect to wait but the staff was prompt in seating those waiting when tables became available. I tried the bacon avocado Benedict and it was delicious. Will definitely be back again for breakfast soon."}
{"text":"This one came to my mobile app as the best breakfast place in Cleveland area open on Sunday morning at 7:30 AM.   I would have liked to disagree with the reviews but I can not. This place is awesome. It has the feeling of a homely place. I walked in and was asked to sit where ever I would like. It was not that packed so I can not say anything about how busy it can get, I was there at 7:30 so it was early Sunday morning and people has started coming in when I was leaving. I was looking for something and the waitress lady told me where the restrooms are, I did not have to say a word !! As soon as I came back she asked me if I would like some coffee. I like to drink tea and it was served promptly. They do not have a great selection of teas, just usual Lipton tea bags, but they served it with the selection and hot water and refilled my hot water a couple of times too !  I had the veggie eggs Benedict, which is the first time I had eggs Benedict in my life and I will be ordering more of this dish for sure. I just ordered because it was first choice on the menu. It was awesome. The staff is very friendly. Sitting arrangement is nice in a small cafe like environment.   The most important thing I noticed was that the waitresses know most of the customers present in the cafe and they were extremely friendly. Food is great and the environment is nice.   It is surely the five star cafe in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Best brunch in Lakewood! Always quite busy, but well worth the wait. Get the eggs Benedict and hash browns with cheese."}
{"text":"Checked this place out recently and it did not disappoint!  When we showed up, there was a line out the door, but it wasn't too far out the door and seemed like a good sign, so we waited.  Everything was delicious.  I had breakfast tacos and normally never finish all my food, but those tacos were so good I practically licked my plate.  We ordered some queso home fries (or hash browns?) for the table and those were amazing too.  We had a group of five and everyone was smitten with the place.  When we left, the line out the door was a LOT longer.  I'm going back for sure, but am going to shoot for going early so I don't have to wait!"}
{"text":"An excellent breakfast option in Cleveland with great items and outstanding sliders. I went with 2 others and my pancakes were top notch the plain pancakes that you can eat with nothing else but even better with some syrup. The slides were superb and if I had a breakfast in Cleveland I would get these as my sit down breakfast. The service was good with canned soda no fountain drinks so be aware no refills. This is a crowded place so ensure you get there early and don't miss it it is a small space off of the street."}
{"text":"I have has this on my list for quite some time now and couldn't be happier to finally eat here! We went on a Thursday around 11:30 and were able to get a seat before they closed up for the day. I would recommend visiting on a weekday due to the long lines on weekends despite the fact that this is a cash only establishment.  This quaint breakfast nook serves up delicious breakfast foods with a south western influence. I went with a chipotle breakfast sandwich and a side of hash brown potatoes. The potatoes were outstanding, crispy and well seasoned. The sandwich was fantastic, served on toasted ciabatta with eggs, bacon and a smokey chipotle sauce.  It's hard not to enjoy yourself while eating flavorful food in a diner with such sunny decor! This is a must try!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant with great service and good food.  I'd be lying if I said it was the best thing I ever had, but everything tasted fresh and the service was good enough to make this into a 4 star place.  I ordered the carnitas and my bf ordered the breakfast burrito.  What I got was not your typical carnitas.  It didn't have any of the similar seasonings you'd expect to get with carnitas and it wasn't shredded.  It was more like sliced pork roast.  The salsa on top and the accompaniments were good enough, but I wouldn't call this carnitas.  The burrito was tasty indeed but very small.  I could have very easily ate two of them.  With that being said, this is one of those places where the service really stood out.  Definitely had that small town feel to it.  Prepare to wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"They have been either closed about half of the time I make attempts to go there or they end up being too crowded inside to get a table within a reasonable (30 minutes) amount of time - so I end up going to another breakfast-oriented restaurant such as The Shore, the Coffee Pot, George's Kitchen, or if I want to spend the extra $$$, but not drive as far away -- Sweet Melissa's. I would have never considered writing a semi-harsh review about this place until I tried going on one of their regularly opened dates of Wednesday-- I CHECKED ONLINE TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE BY CHANCE I USUALLY JUST END UP ARRIVING AT THE PLACE ON THEIR ODDLY CLOSED TUESDAY DATE AND HAVE TO TURN AROUND STARVING AND FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO EAT-- to only be greeted by a loose leaf shard of paper that stated \"were closed July 10th!\"  This event created a cascade of memories of how I had to turn away from the Borderline Personality Café on more than one occasion. The occasion prior to the loose leaf shard of paper incident consisted of an awkward wait in the tiny hallway/doorway area of the restaurant within a frantic line of adults and babies with no place to sit.  After waiting about 10 minutes, the waitress (I believe the owner) holding a pot of coffee frantically said she would be with us soon and that it would be a wait, but I wasn't sure what US she was referring to.  I realized that there was no system to the \"wait for a table\" mess after adults with small children started just walking in front of my boyfriend and me --- clearly claiming ownership of the statement \"I'll be with YOU soon.\" This left me glaring with an unaccomplished feeling at the poorly stenciled song lyrics and plastic chairs hugging the restaurant, so I decided to leave the establishment hungry and feeling like an anorexic Carly Simon. Humming the line about coffee clouds in the appropriately stenciled \"You're So Vain\" song lyric, I decided to eat at home and conclude that Borderline is small, poorly staffed, and disorganized. As other reviewer's state, and from a distant memory of me eating there on a special \"I MADE IT IN AND GOT A TABLE\" occasion, the breakfast is amazing."}
{"text":"I've never had a disappointing meal there until today. We sent a muffin back because it tasted like it was cooked on a dirty grill with old meat grease. Our meals came and they were exceptionally greasy. Neither of us finished.    We made it less than 4 blocks before explosive diarrhea hit and was a gross, embarassing mess.    The worst part was that we told the waitress the food was off when we sent back the first muffin and after our meal arrived. She assured us it was fine. She just didn't hear us and didn't bother to investigate or check in the kitchen.    As my mom said; \"that's one place we'll never go again.\""}
{"text":"I really wanted to 5-star this place. After reading all the reviews, I was hyped. But the service was atrocious, and 1 of 2 dishes that my wife and I ordered was IHOP quality.  Pros: + The Bacon Avocado Eggs Benedict is as good as others have proclaimed it to be. It was the most delicious Eggs Benedict I have ever had. So damn good, I am salivating just thinking about it.  Cons: - I absolutely hate when servers at a restaurant visit you exactly 4 times: 1) to give you the menu and take a drink order; 2) to drop off drinks and take your food order; 3) to drop off the food; and 4) to drop off the bill. The server was nice enough when she came around, but just a pathetic effort to earn her tip. - The Southwestern Omelette was chain breakfast restaurant worthy. Absolutely nothing special or memorable.  So when you add up a fabulous dish (Eggs Benedict), subtract a very meh dish (Southwestern Omeltte), and subtract the disinterested service, you get a 3 star place."}
{"text":"Service was pretty bad. People who were seated after us were given menus and water way before us. Had to ask for menus after sitting for 10 minutes. Chorizo burrito and breakfast quesadilla were nothing special. If you only take cash you need have a sign at the entrance stating so - and there definitely was NO SIGN STATING CASH ONLY, we waited for 30minutes for a table ....so if there was a sign we would have seen it. Not going back there are so many better breakfast places."}
{"text":"5 stars for the large container of maple syrup they serve with the trail mix pancakes!  All kidding aside, Borderline Cafe is a very unassuming, tiny little cafe.  The line was out the door when we arrived (9am on Sunday) and it's first come, first served.  We got the cute little table in the window which was neat.  I have to say their breakfast potatoes are incredible (and I've had some incredible breakfast potatoes over the years from great restaurants).  The service is great and the food is everything the other Yelpers are talking about.  Definitely a keeper.  But don't tell anyone...because then the line to get in will be down Detroit Rd and around the corner...and I gotta have those potatoes!"}
{"text":"Fabulous breakfast. My husband and I come here a lot when we want just a great, simple, breakfast. Never had an issue. Downside - they only take cash and there is no alcohol so that's why I say we come for just a \"simple\" breakfast. The menu has a great mexican flare to it. My husband loves the breakfast sandwich's and they have great quesadillas and incredible hash browns. The waitress is always super sweet."}
{"text":"One of my favorites! Great food \and great service. It's run by two sisters, as they are the sweetest. There's a reason there is always a line when you get there!"}
{"text":"I'm weird. I truly don't understand why people like \"breakfast served all day\" places - I like breakfast at breakfast, and anything but breakfast at all other times of day. I just cant get behind eggs, bacon, and toast at like 4 in the afternoon, I don't know - it's weird to me.   However, Borderline Café is my exception to the rule. Seriously this is only place I've been to (maybe with the exception of Pancake Pantry in Nashville) that is so delicious that I WANT to eat their breakfast at ALL times of day. It's SO darn good.  Borderline Café offers breakfast/brunch options with Southwestern flare, think breakfast quesadillas and burritos - and delicious huevos rancheros. Borderline also serves up delicious traditional breakfast fare - omelets, stuffed french toast, pancakes, and yogurt & granola. You can't go wrong with this place.  They ONLY take cash, which is clearly posted on their front door and there is no ATM here, be warned. In addition, this place is small - there isn't a \"waiting area\" and if you stand by the door - you will be in the way. I've only been here on nice days and I don't mind standing outside soaking up the suns ray on a beautiful Sunday morning. There's usually a wait, but it's been short for all of our visits. I'm also not 100% sure on their seating policy because a sign says \"Hostess Will Seat You\" but we've always been instructed to choose our own table.  As for parking, there is street parking available (free on weekends!) in front of the building or around the corner over by Blackbird Baking Company off of Matthews Avenue (this might be BBC's lot now, I'm unsure).  Hours at Borderline Café are 7am-2pm and they are open only Wednesdays through Sundays.  Now on to the important stuff - the food. I super heart their salsas. Whether its the house made tomatillo salsa (its green) on the Huevos Rancheros Verdes (one of their morning specials | warm spinach tortilla topped with black beans, sautéed spinach, two eggs any style, house made tomatillo salsa and cilantro lime sour cream) or the traditional salsa (its red) that accompanies the chips with the Borderline Wrap (two scrambled eggs, choice of ham, bacon, sausage, or smoked sausage topped with cheddar and wrapped in a warm flour tortilla served with chipotle mayo and chips and salsa) it's all delish! I'm addicted to the huevos rancheros and its my standard go-to each time. The boy toy likes to feign like he's healthy and always tries out pancakes (read: those that contain some kind of fruit and oat) and yogurt/granola dishes everytime we're out. His standbys are the Trail Mix Pancakes (three extra large pancakes with granola, banana, and raisins - also available in a short stack) and the Lowfat Yogurt with Low Fat Granola and Fresh Fruit (his fruit has come with a selection of bananas, strawberries, watermelon, and oranges). When he asked about the fruit selections (he's always nervous dishes will come with a lot of \"filler\" fruit like cantaloupe) the waitress told us \"No cantaloupe, we don't play that.\" I giggled.  Although I haven't had the chance to try them, our other dining mates raved about the Breakfast Quesadillas (two crisp flour tortillas filled with scrambled eggs, sausage, green peppers, onions, and melted cheddar cheese - served with house made salsa, sour cream, and scallions) and the Stuffed French Toast (thick French toast slices stuffed with sweetened cream cheese and topped with strawberries and blueberries). So yum.  Finally, the waitresses are fab and friendly. The place is small so the dining experience can be quite intimate and cozy, not only with those at your own table - but also those seated *quite* near to you, but I don't mind one bit. It's a local business and I love going here to support them. We will be back again and again.   Ok, now get some Borderline in your belly, stat!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for weekend breakfast! They offer a variety of southwest-inspired breakfast options that always please.  Every time a friend is in town, we take them here for a great experience.  There is usually a wait going outside the door but it is certainly worth it. Some of my favorite selections are the pita pizza, breakfast burrito, and breakfast quesadilla.  The price is spot-on as well.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"Shit! Only one review for the Borderline? I was there every weekend eating veggie breakfast quesadillas, sour cream coffee cakes, and that crazy stuffed french toast. Their hash browns are the best; sort of like a chunk of potato smashed down and cooked and seasoned just right. Incredible food."}
{"text":"Both the food and service here are amazing. We had the Chorizo Burrito and Philly Cheesesteak Benedict last time we stopped in for breakfast, and both dishes were unreal. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Incredible food! We came in from Toledo on a whim. The Bacon Avocado Benedict is delicious and Kelly is a fun waitress who has no trouble taking care of everyone in the always packed lil' dinner. The guy who I think runs the place also was very nice and welcoming. Be sure to take cash and expect a short but well worth it wait! This will definitely be a place we will have to visit whenever passing through this area."}
{"text":"Fantastic Breakfast!  Very reasonably priced, the Homefries with Queso were incredible and only like 3$.  If you are in Lakewood and you want to find one of those small gems that you probably have driven past 10x's check this place out.    It will be your new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!   Disclaimer: cash only and it's TINY so make sure you are prepared and/or have a backup plan. West End Tavern is basically next door and it's a decent fall back but this place is beter. :)   The menu is awesome - it's loooong and basically has anything you would want for breakfast. I have been here a few times now and been very pleased every time! Burritos, omelettes, wraps, pancakes - everything is great! The side of fruit I got was even better than I expected!   Service is always really good here, as well. For how small the place is, the food comes out relatively fast and the staff is always really nice. Basically the only downside is what I said above: cash only and it's so small that it's sometimes hard to get a table. I've always been crazy lucky and gotten there right before a rush, though!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot for brunch in Lakewood. My husband and I each get the eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast and also share a trail mix pancake (and I always get a chocolate milk to satisfy my inner child!). We make sure to wake up a little earlier than usual when we want to go for breakfast on the weekend because it can get pretty busy!   The only downside is that it is cash only and we never carry cash, but that is our own fault! Totally worth a stop to the ATM.   Service is always fast and friendly and the waitresses are always quick to fill your empty coffee cup! :)"}
{"text":"You're gonna wait for this food.    You're gonna be glad you did.    The thing about the Borderline Cafe is that it's run by two women, who are scurrying the entire time to make it run for the morning.  It's only open for brunch, really, which makes it a little special, like the way that Cadbury's Eggs are only available part of the year so you pig out when you get it.  The inside is colorful, vaguely spanish, filled with other people who are here and thrilled to be in on the secret.    So what's the food like?  Well, they take the standard breakfast fare, do a pass with some Southwestern cuisines, and make ordinary dishes into the most phenomenal, tasty goddamned things you could imagine.  My favorite - I'm a little addicted - is the Eggs Benedict, to which they add avocado and just a hint of lime, so the entire thing becomes suffused with a delicate taste that turns it into something else.    It is the most sublime experience, because Eggs Benedict is not normally a subtle meal - hey, it's a gloppy thick sauce on top of poached eggs, which are about as subtle as Dane Cook - but somehow, the Borderline cafe manages to make every ingredient into a delicate interplay, so each bite is tangy and tasty and HEY KEEP YOUR FORK AWAY FROM MY PLATE, DON'T THINK I DON'T NOTICE YOU TRYING TO STEAL A CHUNK, I WILL STAB YOU.    The fruit cups are filled with thick chunks of fresh fruit.  As in, they chose the fruit and cut it themselves, not dumping it out of the back of some Dole truck.  This is emblematic of their attention to detail - not a snooty detail, but the kind of thing where they said, \"Hey, what kind of fruit would we want in a cup?\"  And so they change what's available according to the season. The French toast is also pretty tasty.    This place accepts cash only.  Why?  Because they can.  So fill up your wallet, get ready for the wait, and be pleasant.  You'll get your turn.  And when they escort you to your table, you'll be smiling, because they're still obviously having fun doing this after all these years."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast! I got the chipotle breakfast sandwich and it was delicious. I heard about this place from a few people and was able to go on a weekday. I've heard it is very busy on weekend mornings. The staff and atmosphere is also great. The only downside is that it doesn't accept cards and it's pretty small."}
{"text":"This is the place I loooove to go for breakfast!   It might take some time for you to be seated, but it is worth the wait every time. It is a small place with no waiting room, but if it's nice weather to wait outside, or you have the time, you should stick it out! Make sure to bring cash. It's a hassle if you never carry it, but it is worth the extra trip to the ATM.    Nothing is too flashy here, but it adds to the small time charm. Paper menus display well priced southwestern brunch items as well as traditional breakfast classics.  The \"basic\" will get you a nice portion of southwestern home fries, toast, and eggs. It might not sound so special, but the home fries are delicious!  Another personal favorite is the stuffed french toast. Best in town, never found better!!  Love this place. Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"First thing, this lovely little spot is cash only. It's worth the stop at the ATM.   This adorable and delicious brunch spot is owned by a friend of my sweetheart's and the friend's sister who is the chef. All sweetheart's friend bias aside, it's a charming place for brunch. I had the chorizo tacos, and they were quite good. I added a bit of hot sauce, but for someone with a tame palette, I bet they'd be perfect. I like something a little zippier myself. The side of fruit was perfect - fresh, varied, and just the right size. If I wasn't trying to avoid the gluten, I would have ordered the Philly cheese steak eggs benedict. Seriously, they did that. I saw an order or two of it go by, and it looked fantastic. The whole place smells like breakfast nirvana, you know, if nirvana has a smell. I don't know if it does.   The service was great! We were well tended, and we even got some bonus advice about how to season new cast iron pans (make French fries in them... best advice ever, and it fits so many problems!).   We'll be back regularly."}
{"text":"What a treat this place is! The food was excellent. I LOVED the chorizo tacos. I also suggest getting the stuffed waffles and splitting them with the table. The cheesy potatoes are also pretty darn amazing. Great prices. Friendly and polite service. I forget our servers name, but she had dark hair and a nose piercing and she was a delight. This place is a must."}
{"text":"Ever heard that expression \"A little hole-in-the-wall place\"? Well, we found a place just like that, and it's a nook I intend on spending more time at.   The Borderline is so small, you might miss it. They take cash only, so make sure you stop at the ATM first, but bring an appetite too, because the food is really special. Most of the fair has a Southewestern flair, and a lot of it is breakfast related, but man, was it flavorful and tasty. I got some breakfast tacos that blew me away, and my wife got sliders (that she was kind enough to let me sample,) which were also major league tasty.   One point about this place; the staff. Nice, helpful folks who were kind enough to make food suggestions after we told them about my wife's diverticulitis issues. They were great.  The food does take a minute as their kitchen is small, but let me tell you, it's worth the wait.   Parking is spartan, with some street parking and some around the corner, but it's worth the trek for this tasty gem.   So, if you're hungry, get a pocket of cash, and head for the Borderline!"}
{"text":"If you come on a weekend plan to wait (likely outside in the cold due to no space for guests waiting for one of 8-10 tables) for a table at this small borderline cafe. This was our first time. I ordered the half order of the sliders and my girlfriend had the bacon and avocado Benedict. The Benedict was excellent. The sliders came on store bought Hawaiian buns and weren't anything unique. The potatoes came with the slider and they were quite tasty. I saw a few people have a side of queso with their potatoes so I asked to try this as well. It added a unique flare to the typical breakfast potato. We also split a half order of the stuffed French toast which I would give two thumbs up. Coffee wasn't anything special it tasted like a Maxwell house or some other generic brew. We enjoyed our breakfast and will return but with so many brunch options in Cleveland it's hard to put this spot at the top of our list."}
{"text":"*Cash only*  We went on a weekday morning because we heard this place gets a really long line on the weekends.  That's usually a sign of good things in store.  We only had a few people in front of us so our wait wasn't so long.  And it was worth it. This place is full of yum, awesome, and more yum.  Our table got the Banana Walnut stuffed French Toast, Breakfast Tacos, and Chorizo Burrito.  There was not a scrap left behind."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this place that when it was my turn to pick where I was going to meet one of my eastsider friends it had to be here. Since I had never been their either, I did my research in advance. She had the southwestern breakfast quesadilla which was huge and I ordered the half order of the stuffed banana and walnut french toast.  While the place doesn't look like much, it has some fun quotes on the walls and the food and waitstaff were wonderful. A half order was the perfect size for the stuffed french toast and my friend got to take the rest of her quesadilla home for a second meal. The prices were excellent as well and really can't be beat especially considering the quantity and quality of the food. I would definitely eat here again and next time I am going for an omelet!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast spot we have ever been to! Hits the spot for pancake/French toast enthusiasts and omelet fans. Highly recommend the cream cheese filled French toast with the strawberry/blueberry compote. Get there early to avoid a line."}
{"text":"Had the avocado bacon Benedict this morning and it was wonderful. This is the fourth or fifth time I have been here and I will certainly be returning. The service has always been friendly and the food is perfect every time."}
{"text":"I'm somewhat confused by all the positive reviews on their pancakes. Maybe I just went on the wrong day? I was so excited to come here based on many positive reviews and articles, but was let down.  The coffee was horribly watered down, probably the worst I've ever had at a restaurant (at least in Cleveland), and the pancakes seemed like a generic pancake mix and left a lot to be desired. I wouldn't recommend them at all.  However, it wasn't an all-bad experience. The avocado and bacon benedict was awesome and so was their zucchini nut muffin. I was told the huevos rancheros was good, but I didn't try any.  It seems the mexican-style dishes are their specialty, so I'd recommend sticking with that as opposed to the pancakes."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  Went for Sunday Brunch.  Very small location.  If  you have to wait, its a very small entrance.  The carpet looks like too many cig butts stepped on and was not very clean.  Tables are small and pushed together.  You are seated very close to other patrons.  Service was SLOW....VERY SLOW.  I asked for a large Cranberry and got a small glass of what looked like watered down Cran Cocktail.  However, the food was very good!  I ordered the eggs Benedict with Avocado and I was very surprised how good it was.    Lastly, going to the bathroom was interesting.  They have a hook on the door to keep it shut.  That is all I will say (not a germaphobe)"}
{"text":"Borderline cafe is absolutely amazing. By far my favorite breakfast place in Lakewood. I have tried something new every time I have gone and have been nothing but impressed!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't go there again!   We waited a long time for our breakfast and the waitress told us to sit by the window.  Big mistake I thought I was eating outside.  I don't think they had any heat in the place.  The food was OK but nothing to write home about.  The coffee was ugh."}
{"text":"Darn good breakfast and they have healthy options (egg whites) too. The food doesn't have the typical taste of all the other breakfast spots; it exceeds it with a little love and fresh ingredients. I would choose this spot for breakfast over any other place in Lakewood. I'm sure they have much better food then what I ordered (veggie omelet), but it was still tasty. I didn't want to over do the hash browns, but they were so good I ate them all! The eggs benedict with avocado and trail mix pancakes sounded pretty awesome, along with all their menu items so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ladies and Gentleman, this place hits that brunch spot in your tummy! This was my first trip! Absolutely loved it, definitely will return - especially seeing that there is, for some horrible reason, a serious dearth of brunch spots in suburban Cleveland. I got the Eggs Benedict (vegetarian style - aka no bacon). My mom got some huevos w/ spinach tortilla thing that looked (and tasted) absolutely phenomenal. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Place was packed (luckily didn't have to wait though). Coffee was mediocre but I was okay with looking past this cuz the food is sooo sooooo good.   In terms of portion sizes, I feel that it wouldn't be sufficient for my dad but it was fine for us. We also got a side of home fries - they should consider mixing it w/ onion and some spices to make it extra delicious. Until they do that - I will glob on Sriracha (which they have) and make things right. CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK!!!!"}
{"text":"There are many local owned and operated places like this one in the Cleveland area! This one is a \"must try!\" Very delicious breakfast and lunch items with a personalized \"southwest\" twist! Everything is made from scratch and is DELICIOUS! The place is so small, one might miss it driving by... But do not be fooled! Places like this are THE BEST and they are way worth the drive!"}
{"text":"So glad we stopped in for Sunday brunch! We got the eggs Benedict and stuffed French toast.  Amazing! It's a tiny restaurant but they serve quickly and it's definitely worth dropping in! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered omelette and the daily special- beef A delightful bunch with mom before heading to the airport, which is fairly close to this place The cafe has more of a rectangle setting, instead of one big area with tables around. This allows a bit privacy space for each table, which is very nice. The yellow wall gives a warm atmosphere, and it accommodates with green chairs and wooden tables.  The menu was a downplay, however. I was expecting a cute designed menu that match with the theme of the room. The menu was printed on a piece of paper:(  The food was fine...I thought it was little too much sauces and cheese..... My omelette has nothing but cheese in it. Personally did not like the fact they put butter on my toast for me.   Service was great! reasonable price. Sometimes a good setting+ good service are enough to make a delightful experience"}
{"text":"Cash only.   Stand in line. It's worth the wait.   Get the Avocado Eggs Benedict.  Fresh fruit. Decent service. Bright yellow walls. Super clean space."}
{"text":"Just got turned away because we have a party of 6. Her option was a table for 3 then a table for 2 then one person would sit alone but \"it'll be a long time\". Unbelievably rude. Plus she literally shut the door in our face. We certainly won't be returning nor recommending this place."}
{"text":"*CASH ONLY* Great little hide away. Small, cozy and friendly atmosphere and staff. Very locally oriented. Get there early if you don't want to wait.  They have specials people rave about but I chose a basic 2 eggs, home fries and wheat toast. It was excellent. I imagine anything you order from the menu would be delicious.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I am always looking for new breakfast places around Lakewood to try something different. I came across the Bordlerine Cafe and wanted to try it out. My first visit, I found it very hard to find the restuarant. They have no larger sign, only a small light up sign in the window, but for future reference it is right next to the new insomnia cookie. After I finally found the door, it was so packed that I could not stand inside. We also noticed a sign on the door that it was cash only. I was not prepared for that and settled on going to a difference restaurant and returning to Borderline at a later date.  The second time that I came for breakfast, there was a smaller wait and I was with only 1 other person. We got seated in a cute window seat very quickly and had AMAZING service throughout our entire breakfast. Our waitress was very attentive and remained calm even thought there was a huge wait. I would say the best way to descibe it was good ol' southern hospitality which is always refreshing! I ordered an eggs benedict meal and was not disappointed.   I would highly recommend trying Borderline out for breakfast. Since it is owned by locals and the staff is friendly and awesome it is easy to look past the wait. Just make sure that you have a small intimate crew and bring enough cash to cover the bill."}
{"text":"The best place ever.   I was in town for work with my boyfriend. We found this gem thanks to Yelp. This is like the Cafe I have always dreamed of that is only in the movies. It was filled with the friendliest locals who openly chatted with everyone about everything from the weather to how the Johnson kid got accepted to Harvard. It was so inviting and we made some friends while eating our delicious food.   I really hope to go back. If anyone I know is going to Cleveland I will insist they visit Borderline Cafe."}
{"text":"I consider myself a breakfast snob. I like certain things and that is what drives my breakfast agenda. I have tried lots of breakfast joints,  all the way from down and dirty dives to super trendy. The Borderline Cafe has always caught my attention, but I had never eaten there. I went for the first time last week, and let me say right off the bat...Top 3 breakfast places I have ever eaten.   The place is very small and  seating is slightly awkward, it's also cash only. With all of these in mind, the food is fantastic. I had a western omelete with hash browns and white toast. Every ingredient was fresh and the omelete was huge. The hash browns were full of flavor and grilled to perfection. The white toast was thick cut and not just \"wonder bread\" white slices.    The menu was big for a breakfast place, but it wasn't overwhelming. There is a distinct Southwestern flair, but there are also standard breakfast items. I will be back and I know that I want to try the Huevos Rancheros and the Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"Alright I think I just have to admit to myself that I'm not a big fan of the eggs benedict. I've really tried hard to like it but the runny yolk is just too rich for me.  Despite that, I must say, borderline cafe's avocado benedict might be the best I've had. The cilantro lime hollandaise did it I think. The home fries were delicious too.  It is a pretty small restaurant. I was there really early on a weekday and it was already half full by the time i left at 8. Service was great. One of the sisters came by at just the right moments and my coffee was always refilled and full.  I think I'm gonna just have scrambled eggs next time, but I will certainly be by again!"}
{"text":"Oh, Borderline how I love thee.  I will make a trip to the ATM (cash only) and get up extra early to go here anytime! It's a tiny breakfast joint with a south-of-the-border spin on breakfast classics.  The breakfast quesadilla, eggs benedict, and stuffed french toast are phenomenal.  Service is always friendly and efficient.   Be aware that the line is out the door on the weekends so you're better off snagging a seat sometime during the week.  It can be a little awkward looming over people while they finish their breakfasts when you wait for a table."}
{"text":"Really good experience my first time coming, Eggs Benedict were amazing here, as was the French Toast my girlfriend had coming in. Really good selection of menu items. Will come here again real soon and keep it updated. 5 S T A R S"}
{"text":"Coffee was wonderful and service is excellent. Food was really good large portions and inexpensive. What more can you ask for? The suburb it's located in is really safe and nice."}
{"text":"Breakfast with a twist.  This place is perfect for what it is. A small hole in the wall but the food is DELICIOUS!  We have been four or five times but this place became an instant favorite. It's a little small so it's best to go early but even at 10:30 it is worth the 30 minute wait.   We have yet to be disappointed but we have our favorites. The chorizo breakfast tacos are really the best on the menu. Corn tortilla, chorizo, scrambled egg, cheddar cheese, and homemade salsa with some lime cilantro sour cream. But if you have more of a sweet tooth when it comes to breakfast they will not disappoint. They have 2 types of stuffed french toast. I recommend the classic stuffed french toast with berries. Not to sweet just enough.   My husband and I get both and split because it's too good to miss the savory or the sweet.  Avoid like the plague: Not having cash. They are old school.  Hit or miss:  Getting a table right away  Don't miss: This Lakewood gem."}
{"text":"This was our first time in Cleveland, first time to this restaurant and first review with Yelp. Just have to say what a true gem! We were a group of four and did have a short wait at 10 ish on a Sunday as there are only 10 or 12 tables, but so glade we waited. We all ordered something different and shared. My favorite was the eggs Benedict. Perfect non-typical combinations from the avocado base to the hollandaise. I'm not usually a fan of avocado either until now. The flavors were all fresh as everything seams to be house made. Even the small dish of fresh fruit that came with each plate was great. Kelly was our waitress and busted her but to keep thing moving. Great place with awesome food and staff!"}
{"text":"Southwest omelette. Not your typical diner. Chopped up restaurant. Food hits the spot."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and each time have proceeded to get the bacon avocado eggs benedict each time. It's the first thing you see on the menu and just from the description it's pretty much unavoidable. What a good combo between the eggs with a southwest kick. I'm sure the other items on the menu are just as superb. It's a very small place and be ready to wait in line if you are there after 9:30-10am on the weekends. Despite maybe having to wait the service is great accompanied by great food."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at Borderline the other day and ordered: *Avocado eggs benny: this one's a keeper...I'd come back for this alone :) *Chorizo burrito: nice red and green salsas but the burrito itself tasted nearly identical to the 3/$1 frozen burritos at your local mini mart :(...processed white-boy tortilla w/ not-so savory filling. This is the primary reason for only 3* *Pancake, sausage link, and eggs: typical...good sausage though! *Coffee: typical diner coffee but seemed expensive @ $2.50  I'd come back for another SW style breakfast but stick to the avocado benny."}
{"text":"Great little place & definitely worth the wait. Wait staff was very friendly & extremely attentive!   I ordered the chorizo burrito which was very good though a bit on the small side. My wife ordered the chorizo tacos and they were wonderful! The cilantro sauce was a great touch and added a very fresh flavor.  Coffee is diner coffee which was a bit surprise with the high quality of food but not enough to detract from overall experience.  Overall excellent experience!  Don't forget - they only take CASH."}
{"text":"Came in here on a Saturday morning for breakfast with my mom and we found a seat right away; I think we were very lucky!   They have one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time at a great price! They have cheesy scrambled eggs, toast and home fries for $4 which my mom and I both got. The scrambled eggs were not dry at all and tasted wonderful with the cheddar cheese.  The home fries were my favorite! They had some spices in them which really gave them a kick of flavor.   This is definitely going to be my go-to breakfast spot in town and I can't wait to return to try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Fellow Yelpers came thru again!    Arrived on Saturday morning right after opening!  Food was delicious, lots of yummy options!    It's cash only so be prepared for that!!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype and the Yelp reviews were helpful! I went at 10 a.m. on a Thursday and got a table immediately, and there were only a couple of diners there. Great for solo dining by the way.   I got the stuffed French Toast and Egg Scrambler (cheesy eggs with potatoes and toast) and a side of bacon. Everything was amazing!!!! I opted for the half order of the French Toast because of Yelp, and that was a wise choice. It was so much food and I have a hearty appetite.   I did think the coffee wasn't as good as I read on here - just your typical diner coffee. Nothing wrong with that, but because it got such rave reviews, I was expecting more.   Service was amazing and even the fellow diners were pleasant."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast on the West Side!  Friendly, knowledgeable staff with good recommendations! All the food is fresh. Ive had several different items and can't even decide on a favorite, which is rare! Worth getting up moving early for (check the hours but I think they close at 1:30 most days).   ? Cash only (may be wrong)"}
{"text":"Favorite brunch spot (and I brunch often).  Always busy but well worth the wait. Old school cash only family run business.   The avocado eggs Benedict is so good I can't bring myself to order anything else.  Only thing I would add is some Bloody Mary's :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in Cleveland.  It is small, and often crowded, and you need to bring cash as they don't take credit cards.  None of this deters me from going there.  I am a native Lakewoodian, but live on the East side now.  I still find myself driving over to the west side for breakfast here.  The thing that keeps me coming back is the banana pancakes-they are just like my mother used to make, and my favorite breakfast food in the whole world.  But according to my fiance, the juevos rancheros are worth the trip as well.  The prices are great, the people are friendly, and the food is fantastic.  It's a tiny and simple place, but they are fantastic.  I would definitely plan ahead if you are going to come here-make sure you have cash and come early!  But even if you have to hit an ATM, or wait 30 minutes to be seated, this place is absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"Simply the best place in northeast Ohio to get breakfast or food in general. I go in every time saying \"Whatever I get cannot be as good as the last thing I got here!\" Every time they have proven me wrong! Quality in a place of such size and ma and pa origins is hard to come by. They push the envelope of quality every single day."}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Plenty variety on the menu. Meals prepared with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I don't eat pork but everything else on the menu I've gotten has been fantastic! Please add turkey bacon or turkey links. From the stuffed French toast to the omelettes everything tasted fresh and homemade. Been here few times so far...be back soon."}
{"text":"Note: borderline only takes cash. You should bring a lot of it because everything on their menu is great! But the prices are very reasonable so you can easily get out of there for under $10-15. I can't believe I've never rated Borderline it's one of my favorite brunch spots when I'm home! Parking can be a bit of a challenge, but the food is worth the wait! I love the muffins and the coffee here and they make a mean plate of eggs. The decor is so cute and welcoming. No wonder there's always a line on Saturdays! If you show up and there's a line, wait for it!! This cute CLE gem is worth it! Way more original than yet another first watch."}
{"text":"Food was great, unfortunately the waitress was a sweaty, unpleasant harpy of a woman.  The very first thing out of her mouth is \"If you're in a hurry you're in the wrong place.\"  I should have left.  Her service was horrible.  She couldn't be bothered to take my order or get me another drink but she can chat with her regular for 10 minutes. Really!?!?  When my friend showed up his waitress could not have been nicer. I would recommend the food, it was really great and his waitress was very pleasant, but the harpy just ruined it for me.  I won't be back.  There are lots of other places in Cleveland to get food."}
{"text":"We are visiting from California and really appreciated the delicious breakfast and friendly service. We will be back next trip."}
{"text":"Breakfast quesadilla was delicious. First time here today and it was amazing. Glad we came early. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST breakfast place around! My boyfriend and I have become regulars here. Borderline Cafe is small and cozy with the nicest staff ever!! I promise they have the best chorizo tacos in the Cleveland area. Some of our other favorites are the home fries topped with queso, stuffed banana nut French toast, and the steak and egg sliders! Be sure to stop in and grab some yummy food, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"YUM!!!    Seriously, is breakfast/brunch  one of  your favorite meals?   Do you appreciate your food being served at the the right temperature with attention to taste texture and presentation...simple, but tasty ?   I've driven past this place many times and never noticed it...thanks to fellow yelpers for pointing the way!   Very small and intimate so you may have to wait and a large group might be difficult to accommodate."}
{"text":"How many times do you order eggs over medium and you get runny eggs? Anywhere but here. They listen to your order. Attentive friendly staff. You hate it when your meal is done and you have to leave. If you don't feel guilty about leaving due to letting other folks in line to get a chance then stay for some stuffed French toast or breakfast quesadillas or trail mix pancakes or fabulous omelettes or any of the other wonderful choices. So, cash only, get over it newbies, family businesses have enough struggles, don't need to add merchant fees. Always clean, decor changes every few years, damn good coffee. Kelly and crew aim to please and never fail. Want to avoid the line- wake up earlier. Best breakfast in the area in my 30 years here and I haven't missed many spots."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money going here.   Cash only place. We thought that was odd that in the 21st century a restaurant wouldn't have a credit card machine ... I'll let you speculate as to why that seems rather fishy.  The place is super cramped with tiny tables and a low ceiling. When we were there it wasn't busy, but I can't imagine it packed ... Breakfast with strangers anyone?  Our server was obnoxious. We were two of four patrons in the restaurant, the other two must have been regulars because the one and only server there was having a conversation with both of them, yelling from back in the kitchen. In case you're wondering, the kitchen gets very hot. We know because I stopped counting after she mentioned that to the regulars 17 times. Every sentence ended with a shrill, ear piercing cackle. I wanted to shove my utensils into my ear canals.  The food looks beautiful, hats off to the chef for presentation. But the taste was incredibly underwhelming and greasy. I don't know what they cook with but our meals sat heavy in our stomachs for hours after we ate it. The portions are also very small. My husband was still hungry after his mediocre omelet.  The coffee is $2.25 a cup and tasted like Folger's. Soda is $1.75 ... A can.   We've had better meals at Bob Evans and that's not really saying much. The atmosphere from the cramped quarters to the loud and obnoxious decor and server, to the cafeteria quality food, makes this place nothing short of just plain bad."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service wasn't. We were rushed, I couldn't even finish my coffee. I doubt we'll be returning."}
{"text":"As the other reviewers said. CASH ONLY!  In town to watch the embarrassment of riches that is the Red Sox baseball team. The play was similiar to our breakfast @ Borderline. Not bad but not great. We appreciated all the reviews! the Male got the southwestern omelet with chirizo added. I ordered the spinach & feta egg whites only.   First, the home fries are fantastic! just done enough without being too greasy. Side of english muffin and we were set  The Male's was very good. nice amount of chirizo and kick without being overwhelming. Mine was meh. frozen spinach and not nearly enough feta.   Service was pretty good although they weren't great about coming around with coffee. Cozy place with breakfast related lyrics painted on the walls."}
{"text":"Good but not great. The food had good quality but the portions were fair but not generous. Would I come here again yes. Will I ensure that in addition to my entree I order a side, yes. The seating is super tight don't bring more than 4 people. This place was very busy but wasn't more than a 10 minute wait."}
{"text":"oh my borderline cafe.....good, yummy, delectable, and uber CHEAP!  they cater to a southwestern menu, (uh, duh....re-read the name)...but they are not over the top if you know what i mean with crazy southwestern flair.... their first page on the menu is full of their 'borderline' southwestern specialty dishes.   i always order the same thing.....cheesy scrambled eggs, add onions with a side of smoked sausage....(drooling right now, as i am starving writing this post).....comes with choice of toast/english muffin and includes homefries.   the boyfriend always orders the huevos rancheros...every. single. time. he raves about them. i have never personally tried.   honestly, everything on the menu that i have had, has been delish.   downside~they take cash only, which is sometimes a pain...and the wait is often out the door.....the inside of this establishment is not very large....in fact it is quite teeny weeny....but as another yelper stated....so worth it....  the waitress' are always super friendly and accommodating......oh and they are not open every day...just an fyi.....  if you are craving cheap, yummy breakfast or brunch, take your sweet ass over to borderline for some southwestern fare..... you'll be happily pleased and so will your belly!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot! Everything I've ever ate there has been great. Always packed and cash only!"}
{"text":"Ok so I finally made it inside to eat here.  After many failed attempts to eat here, I finally made it. This would be great place if I could get there and get a table. I have been trying to eat here the past ten years. The food was good and coffee wasn't great. I had the bacon avocado Benny and it was delicious but I needed more food. Next time I will order a side."}
{"text":"So I finally remembered to pocket some cash on a trip back to my hometown and hit up the borderline for breakfast.  Seating's at a premium yet they somehow manage to mash everyone in.  The arrangements are pretty frugal, the decor on par to a children's nursery, but I'm willing to overlook that three ways to Friday to have more of those DELICIOUS breakfast chorizo tacos that they had.  Another excellent Lakewood breakfast establishment!  PS - go to squareup.com and start taking credit cards. Are you trying to avoid taxes or something?"}
{"text":"I liked the decor and the service. I hated my meal to the point that I was pissed off. I ordered the steak and egg sliders and home fries for $9. The home fries were different and tasty but the sliders were gross, absolutely disgusting the steak was steak um yes $1 per box steak um. I felt completely ripped off and sick to my stomach after my visit. The chips and salsa were form a bag and jar respectively. How this place has such great reviews is mind boggling there are much better breakfast options in Lakewood."}
{"text":"This is one of the best brunch's I have ever had. Like most say - expect to wait. The place is small and quaint, and is clearly popular among its fans. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and it was incredible, delicious black beans with poached eggs and a housemade salsa. It even came with an extra tortilla for mopping up every last delicious drop. A friend got the Bacon Avocado Benedict and it was also incredible. That's what I'll order on my next visit. Another friend got the Stuffed French Toast and while I'm not typically a fan of sweet breakfast options, that was an incredible meal, it wasn't too sweet or too rich, it was almost light, and was really incredible. To top it all off, the service was spot on, the women who run the place are exceptionally friendly, positive, and charming. I will definitely return whenever I'm in Cleveland. My only complaints, the waiting can be a bit much, my meal could have been a tad hotter, and I'd have loved to have a Bloody Mary :)   (no alcohol)"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Lakewood!! Nice staff, but kind of slow service.  I've been here like 10 times it never disappoints!!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little breakfast spot that I just tried for the first time. I'm glad I've discovered this place! I had the veggie quesadilla and it was sooo delicious! The full order is a huge portion so I was able to take home leftovers which was a treat. Fresh homemade salsa and sour cream on the side were great for dipping. My boyfriend had the huevos rancheros and thought they were really good. He was just hoping it would have been a bigger portion. Be aware that it is cash only here. And that you might have to wait for a table. We went early on a Sunday so we got sat right away but it started to get really crowded as time went on. I can see why -  The food was excellent, I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Average to below average traditional breakfast food, so-so service, good Mexican-inspired dishes.  Was packed on a Sunday around 11am, as other reviewers have noted, and not much space inside to wait (expect to stand or even wait outside).   Service was curt but nice enough. The place felt short staffed with the lack of follow through for our empty coffee mugs. Unfortunately the space is long rather than wide, so it's hard to say if additional staff would fit in the limited space.  Food: -- Veggie omelet was okay. Ingredients were fresh, but the omelet was a little on the greasy side for me. There also was too much cheese for my preference.  -- Blueberry pancakes were extremely disappointing.. Not fluffy and bland. Disappointing to find that one of the breakfast staples was underwhelming. -- My boyfriend had the huevos rancheros, which became the saving grace of the visit, and comprised of flavorful pork coupled with other fresh tastes. I do not usually like huevos rancheros but I'd consider making an exception here.  Don't expect anything special about the service. I'd skip the standard omelets and pancakes if I were to visit again. True to their name, their Mexican-inspired breakfast dishes seem to be their specialty and where they shine."}
{"text":"Borderline was solid but I guess I haven't been drinking the koolaid as much as everyone else. Don't get me wrong-  I don't think you'd be disappointed and I would definitely return to try more of the menu but I don't think it's as rave-worthy as everyone else does I guess.   I think maybe my lack of enthusiasm comes from how highly hyped Borderline is. Nothing was wrong with it but I wouldn't say it's in my top breakfast stops list.   They're closed Monday and Tuesday so make sure you check the day. I've heard getting a seat on the weekends is a nightmare because the line is so long. We probably waited 15ish minutes on a Wednesday but it was also winter break so I'm not sure if that's typical.   The servers were running around like crazy to keep the place moving and none of our wait was excessive. I got the veggie quesadilla plus bacon and it was tasty and I appreciate that it comes with sour cream and salsa - I hate when they don't."}
{"text":"Ok, so they don't take credit or checks and you're going to wait during typical breakfast hours, but it will be worth it. The ladies are so sweet and the food so good. The avocado eggs Benedict with bacon is amazing.  Something about the house made guacamole with the cilantro, lime and bacon with the eggs... Yum! My daughter had the stuffed French toast and it was delicious.  (get a half order unless you're a big person) They're doing something right because there's always a line!"}
{"text":"I made a special trip to check this place out. Cash only?! I haven't carried cash in 10+ years. What a poor setup."}
{"text":"Not that this place needs it, but another great experience and review for Borderline Cafe!  In the heart of Lakewood this place is a must stop for breakfast/brunch.  Simple little place (cash only) and a seat yourself environment seems like this should be a greasy spoon type of place, but the decor and and quality of the food and presentation make it so much more!  Check out the pictures and you will get a good idea of the food.  And it tastes as good as it looks.    There is a great menu with plenty of options (and half portions too!).  Need something sweet?  Stuffed french toast, pancakes and other sweets are available.  Want something more savory?  Then you've got your eggs, bacon and hashbrown options available to you!  Do yourself a favor and go...just don't forget to stop at the ATM on the way in."}
{"text":"The French toast is awesome! Very friendly wait staff, but the kitchen seemed a bit slow."}
{"text":"Breakfast for lunch?!? I call it Blunch... not brunch... because it's closer to lunch time than breakfast time- and Boarderline Cafe is a great place to have Blunch.   I checked reviews on yelp for places to go for breakfast before we left the house and saw Boarderline's great reviews- so we decided to test it out along with some of the menu items that were metioned in the reviews.   I had Eggs Benedict and my friends ordered the Boarderline Breakfast Wrap, Chorizo Tacos, stuffed french toast and an omlette (forgot the name sorry but it was great- they all looked equally yummy). We all took a bit of eachothers and my personal favorite had to be the breakfast wrap- flavorful and healthy. The sauce on mine was just a bit too thick but still worth ordering if you're a Eggs Benedict fan, like me:)   CASH ONLY! Thank you for the warning @Raven Anne S. If it wasn't for your review- I most likely would have been \"that girl\" with nothing but plastic once the bill was dropped.  Thanks again:)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Sunday at 10 was almost no wait with the place almost full.  Service was spot on.   Pancakes were delicious.  Several burrito choices too.  And eggs.   Friendly service.   Will return!   Remember Cash only."}
{"text":"There was a line out the door! The veggie omelet was very well made and delicious. Price very reasonable.   The wait after ordering was long but worth it. My recommendation is to significantly improve the quality of the coffee that they serve."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place many weekend mornings and finally set out to give it a shot. There's always been a line out the door (especially during the summer months) so I figured it had to be pretty good.  With that in mind, be prepared to wait a bit to be seated. There's not much room to wait inside, so dress for the weather because you might be standing outside the door for a while.   The inside is cozy. It's a small shop but they do well with the space. We were seated at a small table for 2 right in the front window.  On a sunny day you'll bake in that spot and I could feel myself getting a bit too toasty.   Borderline Cafe's tex-mex menu has a mixture of breakfast and lunch options. Wasn't feeling crazy on breakfast food so I ended up getting a chorizo burrito and a side of potatoes as well.  I was a little disappointed by the size of the burrito so I'm glad I opted for the extras. The food was good but I actually enjoyed the potatoes more than the main entree.   It's cash only so be sure to hit an ATM beforehand. With the popularity of this place, the servers were running around like crazy trying to get everyone's table taken care of so it took me asking a few times before they remembered to get me a refill on my drink. I'll stop back in if I see there's not much of wait."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Slap your a** Good!! Bright fun atmosphere. Very friendly service. You can tell they have their regulars. The server seemed to know everyone by name and when they would be back. And the food is FANTASTIC!!! Had the avocado bacon Benedict, slap you a** chorizo tacos and a half order of banana stuffed French Toast. They were all amazing. I can't wait to come back tomorrow to do it all again!! Wow!!! *CASH ONLY**"}
{"text":"This is the best thing that's ever happened to me. Such a small space with so much character. Family owned and operated the servers are amazing and hysterical sisters. The stuffed French toast will blow your mind, the bacon avocado benny is made by the hands of god himself. Topped with an original line sweet sauce it's crazy. Just crazy. Cash only and there is often a wait but so worth it."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY ALERT!!!  Worth the stop at the ATM. Hasbrowns are to die for. The steak and egg sliders are my favorite but today I ventured away from those and did not regret it. Order anything here and you'll be more than satisfied.   The service staff is small and so is the dining room but they hit you with mountain sized flavors in every dish. The pride they put into every dish is tasted in every bite."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and got the southwest eggs Benedict (no bacon) both times! It's an English muffin with tomatoes, poached eggs, guac, cilantro, and a lime-southwest hollandaise sauce; it is amazing! I will never get anything else when I come here!  Both times there was a wait (under 40 minutes). There isn't a waiting area so you can feel a little squashed in the door way when others are trying to come in/leave.   My waitress was pleasant both times. Great local breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! One of the best things I have ever ate. Recommend Bacon Avocado Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been talking about bringing me here for so long and finally did the other day. I'm almost mad that he didn't introduce me sooner! We made a point to get up and get here super early (about 8am on a Sunday) in order to avoid the long lines and waits that I've heard stories of. We were one of three tables in the place and it was nice, quiet, and relaxing.       I wanted to order just about everything on the menu, but decided to go with the steak sliders. I don't know if I've ever been happier with a decision in my life (whether this says more about the sliders or my decision making, who knows). The steak was so so delicious and came with egg and a sauce that I think I could drink from a cup. Served with seasoned potatoes on the side. You can get a half order, which still would have been more than enough for me, but the sliders I took home were just as good reheated. We also both got coffee which was better than your average cup. My only complaint is that once it would cool enough to drink, the waitress would fill the cup back up with scalding hot coffee.       My boyfriend got the tacos and trail mix pancakes. The tacos were good, but nothing to rave about. The pancakes were the real star. They were the perfect amount of savory and sweet without overdoing any one flavor.       Keep in mind that this place only takes cash, but is definitely worth the stop at an ATM!"}
{"text":"The servers are amazing and the food always comes out hot! Don't forget your cash (even if you do the ladies are so trusting for you to go to the bank). Always a wait but so worth it! I always get the breakfast quesadilla with extra lime sour cream!"}
{"text":"Been going here on and off for the past 2 + years and I gotta tell ya, this place is consistently fantastic! Yes, you will wait if you go at 9 or 10 on a Saturday. If you don't want to wait, show up at 7:30 or 8 and you'll sit right down.   Today I had the most amazing breakfast I've had in a long time. The Bacon Avacado Benedict is absolutely the freshest most mouthwatering thing ever. SO SO good. You MUST try this.   Excellent as always with great service too. Love."}
{"text":"Had the eggs Benedict with avocado very fresh and good was hoping it came w side of potatoes :("}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place! I'm not a huge breakfast person but their food is unique, fast and fresh I'll make the extra effort to get up and get over to Borderline Cafe early. Chorizo tacos are great, portion sizes are perfect and the service is outstanding. Go early on the weekend (between 7-9) to avoid a wait."}
{"text":"Small cute little breakfast place. Great food, friendly servers, great service! I ordered an omelette and had major left over! Also shared a small half order of stuffed French toast with my date and it was way more then plenty! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly, the food was very fresh. Just an FYI it is cash only my friends."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place ever. No joke. I prefer the borderline wrap which is essentially a breakfast burrito with egg, sausage, and cheese. Simple and delicious. The pancakes and other old stand-bys are more than up to par. My wife and I bring our 18 month old daughter and she loves it. She's at an age where she's not the biggest fan of restaurants but she absolutely loves the Borderline.. both the food and the atmosphere.   The only downside is its popularity. Expect a short wait if you don't get there early."}
{"text":"-Cash Only & Metered Street Parking- But the cafe itself... Amazing. I wanted to try everything on the menu the first time I went. And everything I have tried so far has been great with zero complaints (their avocado bacon eggs beni is delicious, though a little awkward to eat... And their burritos are a personal favorite). Our server was an absolute sweetheart, kept conversation friendly but still nice and short, and she was great about refilling our water and coffee whenever we started to get low. This has become the brunch place for me and my friends - I'd recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to pile too much more on top of the heaping (well-deserved) praise that this fantastic little cafe gets already.  It's one of our family favorites for Saturdays after we finish our shopping at the WSM.  Agree with numerous reviews that the option to pay with a credit card would be nice, but you can scrape together the loose change from your couch and manage to get a darn good meal, so I won't complain too much."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN...favorite breakfast spot in Lakewood. I get the avocado Benedict and it's always good. Service is great! Absolutely love it! Definitely stop on if you want a quality breakfast with a Mexican feel."}
{"text":"A few days before Labor Day, we were driving around searching for a late day breakfast spot. (Not Sunday Brunch) Stopped by a local (hotspot) diner to find them closed for the upcoming holiday. Hit another two restaurants discovering that lunch was being served. On a whim, I asked cuzzo to search his phone, somehow he found this gem using Yahoo search! (of all search engines..) The exterior of the restaurant provides little information about what to expect. From the outside, it looks tiny and then the sign indicating it's cash only. (Seriously, it's 2017. We're not in a depressed state any longer and you can eat 1-2% in CC fees for the sake of your customers. This is a time when more often, folks walk around with CCs and some use (NFC pay) Android or iPhone pay services. I once saw a cupcake dealer on a bicycle taking payments via Square on his smartphone. Don't get me started on cash only restaurants with their own foreign ATM. Those fees!)  Back home (in Chicago), I am always on the hunt for a decent breakfast burrito. Somewhere, with their own housemade chorizo and with any luck, California style. I spent time living on the West coast and found breakfast burritos to be an anytime Godsend.   BC had three versions of breakfast burritos and huevos rancheros! (What?!) I opted for the chorizo burrito and asked if they could stuff breakfast potatoes in there too. The burrito was served with red and green salsa on opposite sides of the plate. Dude... FTW, sooo good!!! I don't usually finish meals. Most times I'll take a portion to go. But this was, to the last fork full, sublime! Cuzzo opted for the Cheese steak Eggs Benedict. (We hit Melt the night before and he'd had the Cheese steak there as well) This guy can eat. There wasn't any sauce left on the plate! With a couple mugs of coffee.. we were set for the day. Since we had family back at the crib, we grabbed some Bfast sliders to-go. (Those were damn good too!)  I hope locals keep'em prosperous, next time I'm local a few days, I'd def come back. Cash only turns me off.. sometimes I try not to carry much on my person but on this particular day, luckily I had enough to cover us. Cuzzo only deals with plastic so..."}
{"text":"Cash only! Not open on Monday or Tuesday. This place also gets PACKED on the weekends. Don't expect to just drop by here and get a spot.   I made it a point to come here early on a Wednesday so I could get a seat. I had a friend with me, and we sat at a four person table because the place wasn't busy. We ordered some coffee and perused the menu. My buddy ordered the eggs Benedict and I got the egg and steak sliders with stuffed French toast. The restaurant is nice and cozy. It's not very big, but there is enough room to get around easily if need be. They have some cool wood burned art on the wall that looks like it was specifically ordered for the restaurant. Our food came out quickly, and I was definitely surprised by the stuffed French toast. It wasn't what I was expecting at all, and I mean that in the best way possible. It was decadent and very rich. The sliders were tasty, and there was enough food that I left very happy. My friend said his eggs Benedict was perfectly made.   During our time there, at least 8 people had walked in and greeted the waitress by name. People were asking for \"the regular\" and not even saying anything for the waitress to bring them what they wanted. It has that very neighborhood-regular type of feel to it."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!  Go for the Avocado Benny and bring cash."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everyone is always so cheerful and the food never disappoints. Always my number one spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"The wait in line was definitely worth it! Unique breakfast items that taste wonderful. The best part is the staff, though. Our waitress was sweet as can be, so attentive and made me want to come back just for the overall experience. Hard to go with a big crowd and make sure you have cash!"}
{"text":"This the first time in this restaurant for breakfast,  I loved it.   I had the Chorizo Tacos, they were awesome and the homefries.  I can eat just the homefries alone.    I will be coming back to try the stuffed french toast."}
{"text":"This place was a great find for our Sunday morning brunch. The owner was extremely nice and attentive. The corn beef hash was delicious with some homemade mustard that was tasty. My boyfriend got an omelet with hashbrowns and they were amazing, really similar to au gratin, but better.  The restauraunt is quaint and clean. There was barely a wait and everyone has a really nice, positive attitude.  They only accept cash, but they are reasonably priced and well worth the trip to the ATM."}
{"text":"Super breakfast, great strawberry cream cheese French toast, and good price. Very friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, only had to wait 5 minutes on a Saturday morning.  Bacon avocado eggs benedict are worth the trip."}
{"text":"Very small spot in a nice little neighborhood. Menu was pretty cheap. I ordered a chorizo burrito for $6. It was a smaller burrito than I thought, just a little bigger than one of those frozen burritos. I thought it was good, but I was still hungry. There was nothing else on the plate. I personally wouldnt go back. I would go someplace else with more food even if a little more expensive. Its also cash only."}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast places I have ever been.  My girlfriend and I go here and split a savory item and the stuffed French toast.  It is a perfect combo!   The place is small and cozy which is nice.  However, this is also allows the chance you will have to wait outside.  Not a problem in nice weather, however... One final thing, they accept only cash!  It is worth a trip to the ATM."}
{"text":"Delicious food and big portions for a decent price! The home fries were very unique from the traditional home fry; less cubed and it tasted almost like they added cheese to them. The place is small and quaint and they only accept cash I believe. Overall a quality place to get breakfast."}
{"text":"My 1st time here. A friend brought me here for breakfast. The only negative thing I have to say is that they can't seat enough people to feed their awesomeness to at one time! Make sure you have cash, as they don't take plastic.  I had the chorizo and egg burrito served Christmas style. Just the salsas on top were phenomenal; not only did they look beautiful they exploded with flavor all over the palette! And when I wanted to Alice things up, they didn't just have one generic hot sauce, they had a great selection of different kinds! I'm definitely planning on going back for more...and more. I'd rate 5 stars but with only one menu item in my belly that seemed a bit presumptuous on my part."}
{"text":"I need to make a confession.  I have been meaning to try the Borderline Cafe for well over a decade and wasn't able to actually get my idiot self through the door until last week.    I suppose the price I pay for this foolishness is the years worth of delicious breakfasts that I wasted by eating my morning meals elsewhere.    The above suggests what I thought of the experience, and to state it a little more explicitly, both the food and the service were excellent.  I'm not normally a wrap kind of guy, but throw in some eggs, cheese, and smoked sausage, and I'll play the part convincingly enough.  Nothing against juevos rancheros, but it's great to see a broader take on southwest breakfast food than juevos rancheros.  In fact, I was so befuddled trying to make a decision about which savory dish to order that I completely overlooked the sweet side of things.  I'll guess have to go back, I've got a lot of lost time to make up for."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in Lakewood/Cleveland! I always go for the breakfast tacos and a side of cheesy home fries. The pancakes are always delicious (chocolate chip are especially). One problem with this place is that there is almost ALWAYS a line to get in. The place is small and cozy and the line is usually out the door. But it is definitely worth the wait"}
{"text":"Worth the wait, believe the hype!"}
{"text":"My initial impression of Borderline did not represent the restaurant very well, I'm so glad we waited! When you first walk in, there's a tiny little entry with a wall blocking most of the restaurant. If it's crowded (which it was on a Sunday morning around 11), you'll be stuck in a very awkward place. People trying to get in, close the door, wait in line AND people trying to get out. I would estimate there's between 15-20 tables here?  The décor is pretty cool. Walls are painted a vibrant, mustard-y yellow color, with lots of accent color (chairs are teal!). The artwork is fresh and original. There is definitely a Southwestern vibe and I was hoping the menu mimicked that.  We waited only about ten minutes for a table, but were greeted almost as soon as we sat down. Our waitress was very friendly and fast. I had the Bacon Avocado Benedict. It was so good. The bacon was nice and thick, delicious guacamole mash on the bottom of the perfectly toasted muffin. The egg was expertly poached and topped with a zingy chipotle sauce. I ordered an extra side of sausage and with the side of fruit that comes with it- I had more than enough food.  My boyfriend got the stuffed berry french toast and although I did not try it, he said it was really good. Our food came out quickly, but the presentation did not look rushed. Everything was fresh, beautiful and carefully prepared.  I was also really impressed with the wall of hot sauce. Not sure why I thought it was so cute, but I liked having lots of options to spice up my brunch. We paid about $31 for our breakfast and milks and were both thoroughly satisfied. Parking anywhere in Lakewood can be daunting, but we were able to find a spot easily. This is definitely someplace we will return!"}
{"text":"Always delish! No matter when I've gone I always have to wait for a table. But it's worth it. The stuffed French toast is to die for. I also love their homefries. Red skinned potatoes. Only complaint is I wish they were open on monday and tuesdays. But everyone needs time off, right? Absolutely love this place!!!"}
{"text":"In Lakewood looking for a great breakfast and not sure where to go?  STOP!  Turn your car west and head to the Borderline Cafe on Detroit Rd! Honestly, the people are terrific but the reason I keep this place close to my heart is the food. Completely fresh, very cool modern twists on classic breakfasts, and beyond all that totally YUMMY! I cannot pass up the Avocado and Bacon Benedict. Worlds cannot describe the party of the taste. Truly special. My wife and I went again today, and after all the times we have both had this, we sit in amazement as to how they can make this so delicious and tasty. It's that good. My wife has had other options on the menu, and all of them are tasty and fresh as well. But I cannot get past this. I know good is coming and definitely gets delivered! Try it and join the enjoyment of an awesome breakfast place in Lakewood! * note they only take cash and have some restrictions on hours."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here every Sunday now because it is so awesome! Banana pancakes, French toast, and Bacon Avocado Benedict are the best around! Kelly is the best and great! Great service, great food, and a cute little place!"}
{"text":"A delicious, reasonably priced brunch spot.  The menu is on the small side, and every item looks like a hit."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in all of Cleveland, Ohio. Go there. Bring cash! They only take cash."}
{"text":"Good breakfast food, good service. Its always packed, that's gotta be saying something. Benedict's are awesome, avocado is best. One negative, they dont seem to take pride, or cater to coffee-lovers. There coffee is not too good. It wont stop me from returning though."}
{"text":"The bacon avocado eggs Benedict are so good I would lick the plate clean if I was alone."}
{"text":"Always good. Surprised their salsa tastes like its from a jar, and I wish they would get a square b/c I never have cash.... But everything else is great! While you should always spring for the southwest flair menu items, even the French toast and basic breakfast are perfect. Anything with chorizo is excellent. And the home fries are awesome- especially with Tapatio hot sauce! Get the breakfast tacos the first time you go."}
{"text":"Many moons ago, Borderline was the Sunday morning brunch tradition for me and my high school sweetheart.  More than a decade later, I still look forward to coming here whenever I'm in town.  My two favorites were (and most likely always will be):  1) \"Strawberry Stuffed French Toast\" : Strawberries on top, sweet cream cheese filling inside.  Heavenly.  2) The Southwestern Omlette : Eggs, sour cream, veggies, salsa, cheese.  Perfection.  If you're dining with someone who's not opposed to sharing, I'd recommend getting one sweet thing and one savory, and splitting for optimal flavor distribution.  The line is always out the door, and sometimes down the block on weekends.  So get there as early as possible, or try a weekday for best results."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for breakfast on our three year anniversary. I had the regular French toast (short stack), and he the banana pancakes. Both dishes were very tasty. The only downside to this place was the fact that there isn't much space...especially for a baby. Cute chairs though!"}
{"text":"The bacon and eggs Benedict was to die for! The banana-nut stuffed French toast was a delectable addiction to breakfast as well. Homemade food made with fresh ingredients definitely sets it apart from many other restaurants around. This is definitely the best place for brunch that I have ever been to!"}
{"text":"Great menu, well-prepared food, reasonable prices...oh, and really great service! What's not to like?!? (Our server even fed our parking meter when we told her we had no coins to do so!) And FYI: cash only."}
{"text":"I love when you walk into a place and a server greets you and brings you a cup of coffee  before I even had to say anything - I cleaned my plate - the huevos carnitas was awesome - pro tip they don't take cards - cash only"}
