{"text":"bad service the waitress hardly speaks English the wait is long the table were not cleaned from the dirty dishes at all.The food was ok but way over priced."}
{"text":"The restaurant changed interior decoration, menu and owner. 
The interior decoration went from traditional and nice to grey and cheap. 
Before they had a nice fountain with fish swimming in it and a nice bridge to cross it at the entrance. Now it's gone making for more awkwardly set up tables. 
The owners and staff still don't know what they are doing. 
Went for Mother's Day as I remembered this to be one of the best Korean BBQ places but was sorely disappointed. 
They moved us from table to table twice for no good reason only to ask us to move for a third time back to the first table.
Menu is not bad but the quality of the food suffered the same fate as the decoration: More options but less quality. 

THE FOOOD:
Salmon egg mixed rice : ok
Cold buckwheat noodle : bad (noodles tasted too strongly of wax. Same issue at other two Seoul houses) not enough toppings like pear, cucumbers etc. 
Kangpoongi: bad. Too sweet and soggy
BBQ beef: even though the table we got had BBQ this section doesn't have a fan so no Kalbi allowed. Only non marinated beef?? Quality of meet not bad but not good

THE SERVICE:
They were so disorganized we had to wait 40 min for the meat to come (even though they also have a BBQ all you can eat menu???) and another 20 min for the bill and they forgot to bring the desert 
Staff seemed very confused and were contradicting each other (host gave us table for BBQ in main area because we wanted BBQ) waiter told us if we didn't want to participate in all you can eat BBQ we had to move to another area but when we ordered the Kalbi we were told we can only have it in the main area???
They were also distracting running around not knowing what to do

I miss the old management and quality. Until they improve I won't go back"}
{"text":"GREATTTTT KOREAN FOOD! ordered bimbimbap. I'm from Asia and I've tasted variations of this dish alot. Hooray for the free snacks they were delicious!

It can be pricey if you order the BBQ, but the normal one dish meals are great value for money without being extremely pricey. Huge portions, high quality korean food. Comes with free snacks and fruit for dessert. yum."}
{"text":"Seoul Kwan (House) was actually started by the man who brought table-bbq to Toronto. His original place was Bulgogi House down on Spring Garden. Then he opened Seoul House. His place was always known for top quality dishes, especially the bbq, and amazing banchan (Korean side dishes).

The latest owners, who took over Seoul House Steeles within the last couple years, seem to have brought back the top-level quality of the restaurant. Food is delicious and perfectly presented. Wide variety of very good side dishes, refilled upon request. The owners are there all the time and personally look in on patrons.

I visited a couple weeks ago with my wife and daughter. We enjoyed two different soups and an order of Korean ribs. The quality of the food and service is definitely back, and the price is fairly lower than the other top Korean bbq restaurant in the area. I think that people are catching on, too - by the time we were done, the place was packed!"}
{"text":"Albeit being a great korean food joint, they serve some of the best sushi I've ever had.
They are slightly more expensive than in most places, but the taste and the ambiance of the place definitely make up for it. I am generally fond of quiet places like this one, where you can have dinner seating in a small private room and call the waitress by pressing a button on the table. Having been here several times I will be definitely coming back for more sushi and korean bbq."}
{"text":"I stopped here after a long day of shopping. This is very close to yorkdale mall. 

The service is quite quick. Quality of food was also better than the smaller korean restarants in k-town. I tried the tradition choices: the jap jae myun and pork bone soup. The portions are quite large. Prices are a bit higher than what I'm used to for korean food. I looked at the lunch specials and those seem to be a good deal however it was past lunch hours so couldn;t give it a try. 

Like other korean places, numerous small plates of free appetizers are served. They also serve japanese dishes, but didn't try so can't really comment on how good it is. 

The decor is quite nice. There are small private rooms at the back if you want a more intimate setting. 

There is lots of free parking, close to a bunch of outlets, and accessible by TTC."}
{"text":"Delicious, friendly, excellent service.  Had the hwe dup bap which was fantastic.  They have amazing kim chi.  Super friendly waitress also let us know the Presidents of Hyundai and Samsung have dined there...good company!"}
{"text":"Honestly the amount of food for the price is great. You don't even have to order appetizers with most meals they bring free kimchi and other small appetizers. Try the black bean noodles you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Their prices are good for Korean Grill- I believe it's the least expensive Korean Girll I've been to so far. The quality of the food is also great- there's not a huge variety but it's good enough with good quality. Highly recommended, the staff is super nice too!"}
{"text":"Been here a lot of times, good food great service. Normally for dinner, their food selection are good, sushi roll are gigantic. Their banchan are superb. When u do table BBQ it came with two soup (seafood and egg soup). I recommend them for lunch too, their bento box special will fill you up. Kinda sad that they got rid of takoyaki. But overall this place is my fav Korean restaurant. :)"}
{"text":"The decor left a lot to be desired; I was not impressed when the guy who came to collect payment (NOT OUR WAITRESS) yelled \"NO TIP?\" as he grabbed the debit machine from my fellow patron...I'd advise against a visit."}
{"text":"Great great food & customer service is amazing! The food took a while to cook, but it's ok bc everything else was A1 This place is so underrated! Wish it wasn't as hidden so people could see it more!"}
{"text":"The place is dirty 
We went for our Sunday Lunch 
The place is packed with Korean regulars and they seemed okay
The food came and it was quite small in portion and uneventful 
The problem was that we found a curly human body hair in my tea cup after we refilled our tea 
We could not continue eating 
It was a short body curly hair so I can imagine where it came from 
I told the server and she said sorry and we can give you ice cream and left 
No one offered for a small discount or new tea 
I told them no thanks to the ice cream but they brought it anyway 
Two  serving (teaspoon size) ice cream for human hair in tea 
Don't go there unless you like dirty food"}

I've been really into Korean tofu stews lately so I thought I might check this place out and I honestly wasn't too impressed.

When I got there, the place was very empty. I was seated at a table in the front that had bunches of newspaper and old magazine pages shoved under the legs to keep it stable which is tacky. I ordered the Seafood Soft Tofu stew. It came with some sides (white pickled radish, bean sprouts, sweet peanuts and kimchi) and a bowl of white rice. The server also pours some kind of tea in the pot the rice was cooked in so you can eat the congee after your meal. Unfortunately they do not give you an egg to crack in your soup, which I really missed.

The sides were very bland compared to every other Korean place I've ever been to and peanuts? I'm not sure if that's legit or if they were trying to cheap out of buying sweet soybeans. 

The stew wasn't horrible but it wasn't great. It wasn't served as hot as it usually is. The bowl was very messy from what must have spilled over the edges while it was cooking or while it was being poured into the bowl. The seafood in it was not even close to fresh tasting and very fishy. They claim it comes with shrimp, muscles, squid and oyster; I found one shrimp, one muscle and a few very small tentacles. I'm an oyster fan and it saddens me to find no oysters.

Overall the service was ok. They are moderately attentive at best (even though the place was empty) and not very friendly. There is parking around back. The menu is fairly extensive with both Korean and Japanese food.

Bottom line: I've had better Korean in Mississauga and this place is a little more expensive possibly because it's near Square One. Based on the quality of the food, I wouldn't visit Seoul House again."}
{"text":"Despite a whole LOT of negative reviews, we took a gamble and visited Seoul House on Dufferin as the location was convenient and there is a parking lot, unlike Bloor Street or downtown.  We were very pleasantly surprised.  I actually did not tell my Boyfriend about the slew of negative reviews I read as to not make him biased. 

We wanted to do BBQ and there were no tables available when we arrived.  The host who greeted up promptly asked us to have a seat and shortly after a cooktop table cleared out, they had it cleaned up and ready for us.  

We decided to go with the marinated ribs.  Now, we are used to the all you can eat type Korean bbq places where you scribble down what you'd like and then boxes and boxes of deliciously questionable meats arrive at your table right now.  There was an extensive full Korean menu as well as a page of BBQ options.  Our one complaint was that the pricing was a bit unclear.  His menu has the actual dollar amount whited-out and there was a big of a jumbled up disclaimer that read roughly \"minimum two orders of each type of meat\".   Which essentially meant that they listed price (on my menu only) of $27.99 was per person.  A bit steep right?  

Luckily, the quality of the meat was amazing.  It was marinated perfectly and delicious.  The side dishes \"banchan\" was plentiful and brought out along with miso soup while we were awaiting our platter of raw beef.  Though none of it was replenished but that's not a big deal.  When the meat arrived, it came with chopped garlic, jalepeno peppers and a peanutty satay-y sauce as well as a big plate of lettuce for wrapping and a diced green salad and steamed rice.  

The servers were all Korean ladies who clearly didn't speak English as their first language but were nonetheless very helpful and eager to help up with our menu questions.  They came to check on us but mostly left us alone (which I prefer) except for when we put the beef bones from our platter on the grill, which is apparently a no no.  She offered to bring it to the kitchen to be cooked, which we agreed to, but yet no one actually took the pieces away.... and we were too chicken to ask again.   The same lady also came to check on us at one point and suggested that we try the lettuce wrap and eagerly returned with a pair of kitchen shears to encourage us to slice up the meat for the wraps.  She was also very sweet and offered us some \"Korean cinnamon tea\" on the house for dessert.  I think they offered it to everyone, but it was still nice.

Overall we actually had a great experience.  The restaurant was quite full and everyone seemed content with their food.  Two different Korean families were seated at the non-cooktop table next to us and they seemed to enjoy their food.  Despite being a bit taken aback by the price of $27.99 per person and not per platter, we would still return because it was so delicious.  Perhaps not anytime too soon, but we would return and I would recommend Seoul House.   

To the reviewers who were unsatisfied with their Japanese or Chinese offerings.... come on, the place is called SEOUL HOUSE!  And from what I could see passing by, the sashimi looked fresh and colourful, but obviously the Korean menu is what they do best and that's why they're still there after years of being in a pretty inconspicuous hidden spot in a giant strip mall.  People continue to seek them out.... at $27.99 per person!  

As for \"Good for Kids\" which I always look for in Yelp reviews:  There were a ton of high chairs stacked at the host area and one table with a young child.  The place is large and informal enough that a child would do well, but we won't be going with our toddler any time soon due to the large amounts of open flames and raw meat sitting around!  Perhaps at a non cooktop table though!"}
{"text":"Have to vent about this place.

The food is fine.

But if you ever book one of the private rooms at this place, be prepared if they give away your reservation to another group that they think is more important than you.

We booked the large private room for our wedding rehearsal dinner 3 months in advance.  Then approximately 1 month before the date, the restaurant called and asked if we really needed the large room because another group wanted it and whether the small room would suffice.  I told the restaurant yes, we need the large room.

The night before the wedding rehearsal dinner, we called them to confirm our reservation.  They told us that we were in the small room.  I then got into an argument with them about it and they apologized but said the group that wanted the large room were regulars.  

Maybe that's how you do business in Korea, but that shouldn't be how you do it here in Canada. 

Anyway, we cancelled our booking, got a room at the other Seoul House (different owners) and have never been back to this one."}
{"text":"I didn't know about this place until I asked my coworker who happen to know the owner itself. So I decided to give it a try. And I have no regret as a matter of fact I was more than happy and so are my family that came with me.
The foods that we ordered were superb, the price is  reasonable.
The staffs were attentive and corteous.
The place is also nice and clean.
Its worth the trip for us as we are not from the area, about 30 mins drive from north side."}
{"text":"Huge helpings! The beef bento is a favourite! If you get BBQ ask them not to cover the grill with a foil? Dumbest thing I've ever seen.  Korean service always good, just press the bell.  Fair price.  Huge menu with nice mix of sushi and Korean dishes.  Not as primo as my north York fave, but really good when I'm not up to the drive."}
{"text":"Large servings of meat for AYCE but be sure to specify what you want or they'll just keep coming out with the same mixed plates. Service was horrendous, my husband had to keep going out to find the servers to reorder water, side dishes and meats. Lucky my baby daughter wanted to be walking around anyway. The room we were seated in was freezing cold. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I've been to the Seoul House before, always found it great value for the money. Tonight we had the BBQ, we chose option A, all you can eat. Everything was average, the beef and pork was good, the freebies kimchi, egg and bean sprouts fine, then we ordered the golden dragon roll. Essentially Salmon wrapped roll filled with Shrimp Tempura. The Salmon was virtually non existent, just a tiny piece, then a tiny thin stringy piece of tempura, surrounded by loads and loads of rice. I think they were trying to save money, very disappointed."}
{"text":"We were enjoying the bbq (big pieces of well marinated meat), the soon tofu, and all until we were told that we were not supposed to cook directly on the grill.  We clarified twice and saw the table nearby doing the same. So we tried to cook on the paper and that shut down the enjoyment immediately. It wasn't Korean BBQ, it was boiling meat in the marinate on a piece of parchment paper. I asked a Korean waitress another restaurant and my friends Korean wife and they both said they had never heard of that. I'm gonna chalk it up to laziness in cleaning the grill. Other NON BBQ stuff is good, but I will likely not return given how quickly good bbq turned into tastily boiling."}
{"text":"Terrible! The food was not what we ordered and the manager would not give us a refund!"}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday and it was nothing special. The kimchi was the only thing that I might return for but even then it's still not likely. The kalbi was weird, not a beef rib as I know it, wrong texture, wrong taste wrong everything it seemed more like a really flat piece of  flavorless steak. The side dishes all lacked flavour with the exception of the kimchi. I wanted to take a look at the all you can eat menu but the party I was with wasn't large enough apparently so we weren't even offered that. There weren't many people there and I can see why."}
{"text":"don't waste your time going to this horrible place.  rude service at the front desk.  demanded tip from everyone, including take out item.  note website price is different than actual.  pork bone soup website price is $7.99 and actual price is $11.99.  when asked about the difference, she even denied having a website!  \
there's lots of other better korean restos out there."}
{"text":"Horrible place. The meat was smelly and food was not delicious. I ordered tempura shrimp for a starter but it was fried in a very old oil and it was horrible tasting. Also waitress demanded more tip! I am not going to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Went here the other night for a birthday dinner. Service was very good. We were seated in the back booth of the restaurant. The booth wasn't cleaned properly from the previous guests who ate there. The food we ordered was very good. We had the Chicken and Mozerella Cheese table side cooking dish. It was creative and delicious. We also ordered the sashimi platter which was okay and nothing special. I would be back again."}
{"text":"3.5* 
I went with two of my friends a couple months ago and we were quickly seated. We ordered bento boxes so I cannot comment on the AYCE service but we received our bento boxes fairly quickly. The server was an older lady and she was sweet. We were given side dishes and we all loved the peanut one that was both sweet, salty and a bit spicy. The bento boxes were average, nothing exciting. I thought prices were a bit high but not overly expensive. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Ive lived around this area for almost a decade, this place started out as a Japanese-Korean fusion restaurant with an emphasis on the Japanese. Their sushi used to be one of the best a la carte options in north york for me and the service was always on spot. Of course, as you may have gathered from the rating, it went drasctically down hill from here.

In 2016 this restaurant is 95% Korean food with a few pitiful maki options. Now I wouldnt say Im a huge fan of all Korean cuisine but Ive always loved the bbq and side dishes so I went back to Seoul House. What I didnt expect was awful service and overpriced mediocre meats. The meat was of the same quality youd get at piggys restaurant or any of the other traditional Korean bbq places (as in not ayce) but at twice the price. This would be okay if there was anything worth the premium but there was absolutely not. We were a small group of three, they made us wait constantly and feel ignored even though the seats were only half full. I was certain the service bell must have been broken at our table because there was no way they could have been this rude... right? We had to wait over 15 mins just for the bill after asking for it twice, only to get it wrong by $100. We spent around $70 and the bill came at $170. To be fair they apologized and fixed it so we still tipped them well.

For those who are impressed by the fact that they have side dishes at all, I implore you to try some of the many Korean restaurants in the steeles-finch neighbourhood. Most korean restaurants should have complimentary side dishes, this is simply a tradition not something unique or noteworthy."}
{"text":"I've only eaten the Japanese food here. It was decent and the presentation was nice. The menu is huge and overwhelming, which might explain the average quality of the food. I'm still not sure if I like the ultra-modern interior and I wish they could tone it down a little because it felt a little cold."}
{"text":"Did not have a good experience, (party of 6, Tuesday night, 9pm, AYCE $22.99 option). Would not go again. 

Limited menu, constantly forgot items, had to remind to refill water, did not clear the table promptly, lack of table space and portion control. Had to cook on paper, good side: meat was not burnt, bad side: hard to get flame char, the main point of BBQ.

Did not care for the decor, and door to male washroom was wide open with clear view of both urinals and 1 stall. Had to walk through dish collecting area(s) to access restroom. 

The female staff were friendly, but there was a language barrier.

Sushi rolls were very limited, and 2-inch diameter pieces.

Asked for a second plate of meat, they provided an even bigger portion than the first time.

A male staff member came up to me 12 min before closing time and taps the \"$3 will be charge to each patron for leftover food\" section of the menu. Like, really? Not impressed, since they also have it posted on the walls in small font. (Though, technically, he was tapping the \"2-hour time limit\" sentence, but I assume he meant the leftover food we had cooking.)

1 star for the (mostly) friendly staff, and 1 star for the amount of food. -3 stars for the lack of service and decorum."}
{"text":"Went for father's day dinner.  Table for 7.  Was promptly seated and given AYCE menus and nothing else.  We figure that's all there is, so we order and as we're eating we realize that other tables are eating things not on the AYCE menu.  When asked about it they say \"there's other menus\".  When asked why we weren't given the \"other\" menus there was no reply.  Instantly I'm turned off, totally unhappy that they wouldn't offer all the menus all at once to give us an option of something other than $22.99 a head.  

The food was meh.  Some meat was good some was not.  Pork meat ordered came to the table frozen.  The noodles pictured in the AYCE menu did not show up as such.  What arrived was a small bowl 1/4 the size of the picture.   We ordered doubles of it all because it just wasn't satisfying.  

I will never be going back.  Taking advantage of a newbie and then misrepresenting your food on picture menus....shame."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years, and sadly have to report that the food, and service is getting worse and worse.  It used to be friendly, upbeat and easy to get service, but now it's like they pretend not to see you.  

I find it kind of expensive for dinner, but very reasonable for lunch.  The lunch specials range from $7-15, and dinner can be upwards of $20+ a person (and can be much, much more if you want bbq meat).  Food is tasty, but not drop dead and twitch kind of good.  For a healthy-ish lunch, this place is a good option."}
{"text":"It feels like you are eating right out of a small joint on a busy Seoul street. Service and especially the welcome - not the best- but the food comes out quickly and does not disappoint. They also serve a few small plates before you begin your meal (cucumber salad, kimchi...). I got the bulgogi box and miso soup. Super delicious and tender beef. So to summarize, come for the food not the service. Very authentic!"}
{"text":"Menu online is not the menu that is on offer. We left after they could not accommodate. Not many different BBQ items, minimum order per item two."}
{"text":"3.5ish? I don't know why people said they have terrible service, because IMO, it was one of their highlights. The servers were tremendously friendly even though their english wasn't spectacular, they gave us free pop on the house and they constantly came back to ask us how things were.

We had korean BBQ and in all honesty, the taste wasn't to my liking, nothing compared to the korean BBQ in toronto/east GTA area. I blame their grill, it's not the typical circular grill that looks like a wheel hub, it's just a pretty flat grilling pan that they don't replace over the course of your meal like supposed to (they just replace a piece of paper). The burnt stuff eventually collected up on the paper and it kind of dulled the taste of everything. The small korean sides like kimchi and beans and what not were pretty 'meh'. 

The quality and portions are pretty decent though. AYCE is 20 per person. Comes with extra sides (sushi rolls and korean sides). Their korean sides are pretty well done, which makes me think their normal non-bbq Korean food is probably their better specialties. We had some kind of cold soba noodles and this tofu stewing pot which tasted awessssome. Their japanese sushi rolls are pretty typical and generic as another person mentioned.  Decor is pretty decent and quiet, comfy enough.

Wouldn't go to this place again for kbbq unless I had to, though I wouldn't mind trying their normal korean dishes."}
{"text":"I believe it to be more expensive then sariwon and aryiwon. At off peak times.
But i think if you go off peak its empty and the food is the best in the area"}
{"text":"I'm never going back there again. Service was substandard, very pricy for the amount of food served. and food was not what  was expected. Staff was ill mannered as if we were disturbing them. Sorry for my business Seoul House!"}
{"text":"This place was fine but certainly not great. Cooking meat on top of parchment paper is a real bummer when you want char... Steaming meat is really quite different than barbecuing. They insist that you do this, which I assume is to keep the grill clean, but also takes all the tastiness out of one of the world's tastiest foods!

We had very friendly, very prompt service. The food quality was okay but nothing to write home about. They were out of all the draft beers except Sapporo, which is fine, but again disappointing. 

Reasonable prices for AYCE, okay quality, but sadly not what I was hoping for in a Korean BBQ restaurant. I'll try something else next time!"}
{"text":"Their food is amazing!! Love their service and free refill of side dishes. I had the bbq pork combo and it was very delicious and reasonably priced. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I ordered two lunch specials: bean paste soup with grilled pork and steamed kimchi with pork. They were both on point, and we enjoyed our dishes. I especially enjoyed the number and quality of side dishes we got even though it was lunchtime. I would like to come back with my friends."}
{"text":"I decided to try out this place recently given all the positive reviews on this place. I went around 2 or 3pm on a weekend for lunch, and there was literally no one in the restaurant but us (possibly because of the time period). The decor is really nice and we got a private room, so I really like that you could have an intimate conversation if the need arises (they even have curtains). It is in a obscure place behind Sussex Centre that you normally wouldn't notice (even though I am native to Mississauga, this is the first time I've seen it). 

Were given two complimentary Korean small plates... however they didn't give kimchi (not sure why but they do at every other Korean restaurant) and the choices they gave that day, I absolutely hated. I ordered the sashimi bento box lunch special. Honestly, I can't even remember the taste or how it is because it was pretty... generic. It wasn't horrible by any means, but it wasn't particularly memorable, fresh nor tasty. Nothing to 'wow' me or get me excited to visit again. Maybe at that time of day the fish was not fresh, but it was sub-par to what I could get at asian supermarkets for takeout.

Looking back at my fellow Yelpers who reviewed on the restaurant, it seems like Korean food is the better choice to go. I definitely would not go here for the Japanese food (although some of their specialty rolls on the menu look appetizing). Unfortunate experience that has caused me to not revisit for the time being."}
{"text":"Seoul House has been a longtime favourite of mine, as it's the best Korean place in the Yorkdale mall area.  I have had their Korean BBQ before, but recently the highlight was the chicken and cheese platter.

If you've never had Korean table cooking before, you are expected to order two of the same item minimum, so that you can share one dish together on the grill or hot plate.

I had the chicken with cabbage, sweet potatoes, rice cakes, and onions cooked in a sauce in the middle of the plate.  On the outside is the highlight of the dish and Seoul House; there is a ring where a mixture of shredded cheese and pineapple chunks melts and becomes an oozy layer of goodness you dip your chicken into.  I haven't seen another place that does this, and you must try it, if only to shoot your cholesterol levels through the roof.  I cannot stress how much cheese they actually put into this ring, and we were crazy enough to eat all of it.

The banchan was also above average, with quality kimchi being served, and other complementary dishes being given.

To finish the dish off, rice is added to the centre plate, and you can mix it together with the chicken and le the rice crust up on the grill before eating the whole thing up."}
{"text":"I've seen this place on map for a long time and we finally tried it out tonight. The reason that we waited for so long is mostly because of the the reviews and they seemed not great:( But I'm glad we came here since it's much better than I expected. The stews are very delicious and I love how they provide the purple rice on the side instead of regular white rice. Although the price here is slightly higher than Korean places on yonge/finch, but if you think about its location, parking and the environment, it worths the money. The only problem we had is that I don't think there were enough waiters/waitresses or they were too busy. However, overall it was great and I would definitely recommend this place to my friends:)"}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant.  Sushi tasty and fresh and really enjoyed the sides included in the dinner. Nice flavours.  Very friendly staff. Waitress and sushi chef both.  Reasonable price.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been told this is authentic Korean.  The food not the décor. 

I've only came here for lunch, three times I think in the past 10 months. 
I get the feeling of being in a scene of a Korean mellow-drama when sitting at the table here for lunch, staring out the window.  The table and chairs are pull out, which gives this place an air of affluence.  It's very clean, very quiet, an adult restaurant.
The food is priced reasonably, unless you order the soft shell crab.  It's very good, but for $15 you get almost nothing.  
It's got Korean BBQ capabilities at all the tables, but I've only ate off the menu.  It's not busy at all during lunch, and because of that I've gotten to appreciate the impeccably mannered waitress with the beautiful smile.  Her English is not perfect, but I wouldn't want it to be.
There's a full bar, so I must assume that at night this restaurant becomes a completely different atmosphere.  

The details in the décor slightly resembles a Korean Mob Boss' office, it's really got the ambiance of a 'Seoul house'.  
I really enjoy the fried dumplings here, and because the restaurant is deep into the plaza of 180 Steeles, it's remarkably quiet for a buzzing area. 

There's not much to say about Seoul House, it's mundane, but a good relaxed mundane.  A little hidden escape in a heavily trafficked neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Omg. Came here for lunch during a cold winter day and the restaurant was freezing cold. We had to keep our down jacket on the whole time! Staying away from this place."}
{"text":"Everything was good, biggest sushi role I have ever had (special roles ) good value. Service was good, better than expected. I will return :)"}
{"text":"Bibimbap was lackluster... at best. The rice was not heated enough and therefore not crispy.  When we brought this to the attention of the sever we were told to have indicated we wanted it crispy. Is crispy rice not the whole point? Toppings were so so... broccoli has little place within this dish. Soft shell crab was tasty but brought out in a straw basket and not worth 12$. Service was sparse... we were brought our food and not visited by our server again.

Also.. the air conditioning was shut off and a fan was turned on in our direction. The restaurant could use a clean up!"}
{"text":"I usually come here for lunch when i'm craving some sushi. Although i'm not vegetarian I always choose to get the Vegetarian bento box which cost $12.99 + tax I believe. For $12-$15 per bento box you do get a lot for your meal, you get 8 pieces of California roll sushi, 6 pieces of Sweet Potato sushi (my absolute favourite here!) , sweet potato and squash tempura but I always just ask for sweet potato tempura, 2 dumplings, and salad. 

*Of course you get a typical bowl of miso soup & 3 or 4 random appetizers (my favourite would be the sweet potato noodles or seaweed salad so ask to receive one of these as one of the appetizers if you can, they're delicious!)  

Please be careful if you have any allergies as they don't tell you what the appetizers are when they give them to you. I have a peanut allergy and found out that one of them had peanuts in it and they switched that appetizer immediately. 

The servers here are pretty nice, however service is a bit slow even when it isn't that busy. 

I'd definitely suggest trying this bento box if you're ever around the area! 
-Note that this bento box is only for their lunch special"}
{"text":"Nice Korean BBQ all u can eat.went there last week for lunch. Tried course A,its $23.  (Weekday)
But they did not give us lunch menu. 
Good price for any meat lover. Beef ,ribs ,chicken and pork belly. They are seasoned and fresh with pink colour,I like it.  Miso soup is good,a little bit salty. Side dishes as usual.
Not surprise me too much. But this is mississauga,how can u expect more."}
{"text":"The food here is always top of the line.   I've never had a bad experience here.  The service is always fast.   We wouldn't eat Korean food anywhere else."}
{"text":"First of all, I am a Korean food connoisseur as I have lived in Korea for a year and have eaten all over that country and all over Korean joints in Toronto.

In ALL Korean restaurants I have been to, Korea and Toronto alike, they offer unlimited free side dishes (known in Korean as banchan). ALL Korean places, EXCEPT Seoul House. When I tried ordering more side dishes here, I was told that I would have to pay for extras. This completely shocked me as no other Korean place I have eaten at in my entire life has ever told me this. Korean restaurants are known for their unlimited side dishes but this place is the one in the world who does not offer this.

The servers are really rude and don't smile or care to be nice to their customers. I tried small chatting our server but she didn't smile or seem interested in talking. The lady who sat us down also was not in a great mood.

The food itself wasn't bad, but I have had MUCH better Korean food in Toronto. Seeing as this is a review on Seoul House and not me endorsing other places, I will leave you to discover these other places on your own.

Seoul House is not an authentic Korean food experience, is not authentic Korean hospitality and will break your wallet. Please go elsewhere unless you like miserable servers, mediocre food and paying more than you should."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in the busy intersection of Dufferin and Orfus Rd. within a busy plaza. Although there's lots of parking spots, it might be difficult to find one, depending on the time of day. 

This is the only Korean restaurant within the Yorkdale Mall area. They also do Sushi. 

I have been here a few times and I find the place underwhelming at best. The place is large with the entrance separating the restaurant into a Japanese and Korean BBQ sections. They also have a party for large gatherings. Service is good for the most part. 

In terms of food, there's nothing memorable for me. Even with the large menu with Korean staples along with Korean BBQ and Sushi, there's nothing that stands out. I have tried various dishes and have left disappointed. 

I think the only reason that this place is around is for people craving Korean food and not willing to drive to Yonge street.

BTW, their Jjamppong is not very good either. My search continues...

{"text":"I believe we got the head waitress but she was very friendly and had quick service. one of the ribs we orders was shorter than the other and immediately she goes back and comes back with extra meat to makes up for the short length :) The food is very flavourful and each tables has its own grill using charcoal. Of course, it being a Korean restaurant there are plenty of complimentary side dishes and the atmosphere is casual and relaxing."}
{"text":"saw a crokroach on the walk there...
the waitress just came in and wiped it off the wall with a tissue...
then another one came in and start charging us and went you, you you and you.....no apologies whatsoever"}
{"text":"I've eaten here numerous times and every time I go, I always get the pork bone soup. I just love the broth and how tender the meat is when it falls off the bone. I will say that the sides that come with the food here aren't the best but I come for the soup, not for the crappy kimchi. The place is right on Orfus, so you can shop and then go there to eat. It's never really packed so if you want to go by yourself then you can totally do that (I have)."}
{"text":"I appreciate that this place was open on the long weekend.  We all ordered  different bibimbaps (individual rice dish in a hot pot). It was pretty satisfying, good price.  Service was pretty fast."}
{"text":"The kbbq was great, we were a group of 5 and we chose course A. The pork belly and beef were the best. Its really hard to find an all you can eat kbbq place that serves pork belly. I'm definitely coming back again very soon! This is probably gonna be my kbbq spot from now on"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times for lunch.  Their bento boxes start at 7.99, and there are numerous choices, such as bulgogi, 12 piece California rolls, chicken, etc.
The quality is quite good, and like many other Korean restaurants, you receive 4-5 different banchans, which are different every time - kimichi is usually one of them.  They are always willing to offer refills.

The bento boxes will come with different components each time - always rice and the main dish, usually japchae (the glass noodles), fried tofu, salad, and two rolls.  Miso soup is included, but no dessert. 
The portions are quite generous for the price.

The service is quite efficient, so I'd definitely recommend coming here if you're in the area for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place seems to me like the Red Lobster of Korean Restaurants. Nearly everyone in the place was celebrating something, like a birthday or graduation. 

I had the tofu chigae, and it was fine. A bit on the salty side. Service was friendly and atmosphere was comfortable and clean. 

Not my first choice for Korean food, but not a bad place to go to, either. I might check out their Korean BBQ next time, as that's what everyone here seems to enjoy."}
{"text":"Food was ok..  But service was extremely SLOW, AWFUL,  AND RUDE Staff!! When it's was time to pay the bill,  the staff threw my receipt on the table..  Will never go back here again...."}
{"text":"REALLY GOOD!

The service was good, the waitress was really nice and everything came really quickly. Theres a button on the table that you can click so you don't have to wave anyone down.
I got spicy pork bibimbap, the stone pot was SUPER HOT! it was awesome. 
Some of the food is a bit on the expensive side compared to other korean places, but the food is really delicious and worth it. 
Even my dad, who is so picky with foreign tastes, really enjoyed everything. 
I'll definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is but this place just doesn't do it for me anymore. I always feel like I've had better Korean food elsewhere and the service is less than mediocre. I was feeling little under the weather and decided to get the duck mandoo guuk. I've had it before and it was very tasty but that day it was lukewarm and not enough duck. The food used to be really good but never wow'd me. Now it's just \"good\" enough to come with a large group of people."}
{"text":"so why 2 stars?

we stepped in because the lunch special announcement on the front entrance claimed that the lunches are $7.99! wow great price. 

we get in. we flip through the menu and notice that the lunch menu only has 2 bento boxes for $7.99 and the rest is over $10
not happy.

it was specifically frustrating to me as the only vegetarian bento lunch box was $12.99... but they turned one of the basic bento boxes into vegetarian by replacing chicken with tempura or something of sorts. 

what I liked is that even though you order bento bo = japanese, you end up getting korean appetizers. and miso soup of course.
also my fave sweet potato noodles are part of the bento boxes in this place so I really enjoyed that part. 

each boot also has a space for bbq on the table. 

overall not bad for the price. though the lunch deal is still misleading."}
{"text":"It's been a while last time we came to this place. We arrived late this time as we didn't want to be stuck waiting during lunch rush hour. Surprisingly the place is still busy but we got our seat immediately. I wasn't sure if it is because the long weekend but it seems there wasn't enough staff serving tables. It took a while before we can place order. We didn't get any service at the table, no eater refill either. We didn't get our check out bill and re front desk was rude asking where I was seating when I already told her several times.

Regardless of their service, I still enjoy our foods we ordered. The portion seems to be bigger than other Korean restaurant but of course, price is higher. Most of their dishes include seafood soup base, we guess seafood are frozen ones. The soup was sweet.... bimbimba Korean rice in stone bowl was good. We tried a cold noodle....won't try it unless it is a super hot weather. 

Next time, we will try the bbq. Sadly they need to improve on their vent exhaust as the entire place smell like smokes. But definitely smell good."}
{"text":"I ordered a pork bone soup. Taste was ok but the server was extremely nice. Love this place."}
{"text":"Seriously.   This is one of the worst Korean restaurant meals I've ever had.   Major disappointment .   Ordered soondubu, haejangguk, mulnaengmyun and tangsooyook.  Soondubu was bland (no egg? WTF!) , haejangguk was ok (dad said \"edible\"), the naengmyun was terrible.  One band-aid size sliver of beef, smattering of daikon, no cucumbers and my aunt had no egg in her bowl (I called it out and they brought one  - in fairness to them they apologized).

The tangsooyook at $25 was a rip off.   Small portion, horrible presentation and bare bones ingredients.   The photos you see from others was definitely NOT what we received.  

I've been here at least 5-6x in my life and it's definitely gone downhill.   I feel badly because I want the restaurant to do well (sorry, it's the Korean patriot in me) but the review had to be written because I want the owners to step up and deliver a better product.   Korean food is way better than what's being served here - hopefully they  read this, get angry (K-town style) and turn this ship around."}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday night with a few friends.  There were lots of Koreans there which was a good sign.  We had Korean BBQ and ordered kimchi jigae.  We found the meat really tasty and tender.  We got the ribs and marinated beef.  It was sort of expensive given that several Korean BBQ restaurants in Koreatown offer all you can eat meat but it seemed to be higher quality meat.  

The service was not so great from one server but the other one was attentive and explained the menu items clearly.  Not the greatest BBQ place but if you're in the area and craving Korean then I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I only come here for their table cooked marinated Korean ribs.It does cost quite a bit(+$25 per person,minimum 2 orders). The ribs come with a choice of soup and during summer you can usually get cold noodles aka nengmyun or spicy noodles(bi bim neng myun) instead of a bowl of rice.

I wish they'd give more veggies to go along with the meat.They do have the button thing on the table so you can call the servers whenever you need something.
The servers are nice enough to grill and cut the meat for you,but I wish they'd just leave me alone so I can grill it the way I want to.

They use charcoal and I guess that's why the food is so damn good,along with the fact that their marinade is mouthwatering.Those Chinese owned Korean bbqs cannot compare to this restaurant.You can tell just by how the food tastes.

They also offer sushi and other Korean dishes such as soft tofu soup or Chinese styled Korean food but I have yet to try it.

I suggest trying this place out at least once and get the marinated ribs!"}
{"text":"My friends and I eat here often because we like the food, however, the service from the other day was not so good. It wasn't that busy when we got there but it took a while before they took our orders. It also took them quite a while to give us water refills. We had to keep looking for someone. The lady who was serving us was rude. No smiles. She didn't even look at us. She just kept frowning even though we didn't do anything bad. We would say our please and thank yous and she would only ignore us. She even just dropped the utensils on the table like she didn't care. We let it go. Maybe it was a long day. That same lady, Susan (or whatever her name is. I only got to read the \"Su\" part because the rest of her name was covered) was the one who handled our bill. My friend was obviously annoyed with the service so she didn't tip much. That lady specifically looked at the receipt and got mad at my friend for not tipping 10%. She also looked at my receipt and looked if I tipped. I did and I kind of regretted doing so, what with how the lady was acting. She then kept going about how in   restaurants you're supposed to tip. And that you can't not tip. My other friend asked if they should pay again (both my friends bill was together) because the lady is making everyone uncomfortable. The lady said no because they cant do like a 2 dollar transaction or something. I dont really know. 
I know my friend tips but you can't really force someone to tip you good when the service is bad. So then both the server and my friend were arguing. My friend then said, \"maybe you should give good service\" in to which the lady replied, \"maybe you should stop coming here then.\" 

We left after that but I was very offended by that. Considering that we always come to that place. I'd rate 1 out of 5 but food is good so...."}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing special bur rather on the bland side and very dry. 

The service was definitely weak, took a while to get our food and even longer to try to get the attention on any of the waiters."}
{"text":"As a group of three mature women, we waited an hour until i chased the waiter. He said there as a mixup in the kitchen. We watied another 30 minutes and i chased him again.  The food was dry and luke warm.  Had to chase another person for the bill.  During this time other tables came and went and had great service.  Not a way to have three business women return."}
{"text":"So wrong. 
I can't believe they call themselves \"Seoul House\". This is the most unauthentic Korean food I've ever had and it is owned by Koreans. 

First, the place is filthy. You can actually feel the grease on the wall.  They don't even turn the vent on because they force you to \"grill\" on parchment paper.  It cooked so slow and unflavourful, we kept ordering rice and sushi as a filler. 

They didn't even serve Kimchi and the soybean paste they had was liquidy and diarrhea yellow.  
Oh ya. The cold noodle (nangmyun), they gave it to me with white (somyun) noodle. It was laughable. 

I don't know how other Seoul House locations allow this place to operate this way with the same name. 

Do NOT go here."}
{"text":"If you haven't eaten at a lot of Korean restaurants, I'd imagine you'd think this place was good, because it isn't terrible and it seems convenient that they have a Japanese menu. However, having had a lifetime of korean food experiences, both home and restaurant, and having eaten here nearly every time I'm in Toronto (my family seems to love going here, I think it's the location), I can honestly say that it isn't all that. In fact, it seems to have gotten worse over the years. 

We ordered 3 dishes to share, and the first two came out and were alright. The tangsuyuk was kind of soggy and a little too vinegary (not to mention that the beef was also a little too chewy), and the jjajangmyun was good but nothing special. We waited and waited for our naengmyun which never came, and they brought out our dessert drink and our check. Sure enough, it was on there, so when we told them that we never got it and didn't want it anymore, instead of simply removing it from the bill and canceling the order, the lady said \"oh no, they are making it now we just had so many orders for it.\" Yeah, right. Then why did you bring out the dessert drink? You can't really save naengmyun, but since the service was so slow we were already full. We tried to eat it anyways, and it was alright but we barely ate half, kind of lame that they didn't just admit they forgot and cancel it, but oh well. 

Despite all of this, the ladies seem nice enough. Smiles can't save the food, though, and given the choice I'd rather not eat here again."}
{"text":"This place needs to get a clue. 

Our family came to have lunch on Sunday, July 3rd and the website states it is open from 1130 am. We have young children and eating at this time is not unreasonable. We were told by a staff member that they open at noon and when we told her that it stated otherwise on the site, she denied it and told us that we can wait outside while they open. She was extremely rude and dismissive. Coincidently, another patron entered while we were there and he too was told rudely that they were not open. 

This place can easily do an edit to their website and have their staff learn what it means to give customer service and how telling potentially paying customers that they are essentially lying is not a good call.

Whether their food is good or not does not call for rude staff and we will not spend any money here. They're not the only Korean restaurant out there so they need to get their hours sorted out and let their staff in on when they actually want to operate."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed or disappointed by this place.  On a day where I was working from home and too lazy to drive my car anywhere, I decided to walk to the Square One area.  

I had the bulgolgi stone pot bimibap, which came with some standard banchan (Korean side dishes - kimchi, roast peanuts, bean curd, and green beans).  

What to like:  The stone pot was very good and it was cooked perfectly. Perfect temperature.  Add the kimchi and hot sauce and bam! - you got yourself a perfect bimibap. 

What not to like:  All the banchan is very meh.  Tastes very grocery store like.

Verdict: Worth a try if you work or live in the area, but not worth a drive."}
{"text":"We had reservations at Seoul House for a family gathering. When we arrived, we were seated in the room off to the right. When we asked about bbq at the table, we were told that they could not do table-side service in that room. Instead, they would cook in the kitchen and serve. We were there for the bbq so we asked to be moved to the main dining area. No big deal as there was only one other table. For whatever reason, the waitress did not want to re-seat us and we had to ask several times to be moved. Finally, we asked for the person in charge and was promptly moved to the main dining room.

The waitress took our order. The food began coming out. After about 10 minutes, we asked the waitress to bring us the bowls of rice as they had yet to come out. Another 10 minutes passed. More food was brought out but no rice. It finally came out close to 30 minutes after the food came out. The waitress then brought out the two big soups that we ordered ...then four smaller soups followed. When we asked what the additional soups were, she replied that the bbq meal came with soup. 

We were beyond angry. When we were placing the order, the waitress should have told us that the bbq meal came with soup so it wasn't necessary to order the two additional soups. They are the experts when it comes to the menu and she should have gone over the order with us. We clearly had no idea that we were ordering 4 small soups and 2 big ones. We ended up taking all the soups home.

While the food was decent, the service was so bad, we will never return."}
{"text":"I wanted to try the seafood stone pot bibimbap, but they said they didn't have it.  I got the $16 Hoe Deopbap instead and it was pretty good.  This dish comes with raw salmon and white fish on top of fresh vegetables (cabbage, lettuce, shredded beets, and carrots) and a side of rice.  They also gave me hot tea, miso soup and banchan, which were all really tasty.

Plenty of parking in the private lot.

{"text":"Came for lunch on a whim just based on the name! After all if it's called \"Seoul House\" how bad could the Korean food be, right?

The dining room is very spacious and they have pro vent hoods over all the cooking tables. I noticed there was also a side room with a few non-cooking larger tables available as well.

The waitress was quick to come by and take our orders which consisted mostly of BBQ meats including Kal Bi and Chicken. Also ordered a Korean dumpling soup and a Bimbim bum.

Overall the food was OK. Nothing amazing and had the prices been less it could have fetched four stars but at the price they charge for portions it is at best 3.5 star.

Service was decent. Waitresses were friendly and fairly quick to change the cooking plate when needed. We had to ask twice for some kimchi to be refilled but other than that nothing remarkable either good or bad happened.

Overall a decent choice but that's about it."}
{"text":"As a Korean, I am ashamed and embarrassed that this restaurant is representing the Korean cuisine in such a poor manner.  Aside from the poor quality of side dishes which you could tell was not fresh and were the leftovers of previous customers, the main dish we ordered; hamul  jongul (seafood stew) came at a bigger disappointment.  I can't believe the kitchen would send out something like this for their customers to eat. The broth was extremely bland, none of the ingredients were fresh, the seafood in the stew were spoiled, as the shelled clams and mussels did not open after boiling.  And let me add, this extremely unsatisfying and poor representation of this delicate Korean dish came at a hefty price-absolutely not worth it. After having only a few spoonfuls of our meal and walking out to pay for our meal at the counter, the waitress could witness we didn't finish our meal and asked why.  We politely told her that at least half the seafood served were not fresh and the meal was overall distasteful and unsatisfying. Her response? She just chuckled...and the owner of the restaurant who was standing nearby completely ignored the encounter, he simply did not care.  No apologies given. I usually do not write reviews for restaurants I visit, but decided to do so for this experience in hopes the restaurant will better the quality of their dishes by being mindful when cooking and demonstrate the Korean cuisine the right way... Overall, to the non-Koreans, this is not the restaurant to go to have good authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"Ok, service sucks but it's a typical Korean restaurant. I'm there for the food.  Food was very very good quality - We were  a group of hungy people so eight of us had a very good selection of both bbq and rice or noodle dishes.  I would say skip the soon du bu chigae - it was bland though the tofu was very silky.  Loved the meat. very good quality."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets so little love on Yelp. Hubby and I came here with friends on a Saturday evening. There is free underground parking- you just have to write down your license plate on the clipboard in the restaurant. 

There are a number of sushi and of course meat and seafood options for dinner. Sushi options are decent including green dragon roll, red dragon roll, and dynamite roll. They ingeniously provide parchment paper to place over the grill which keeps food from sticking and charring. Occasionally we had to pull back the paper and pour the accumulated juices into the grill but even this did not result in some of the grill flare ups observed at other Korean grill restaurants. 

My favourite meat was the pork belly. If cooked long enough it develops a nice golden brown exterior but maintained its softness and flavour. 

I also enjoyed the selection of banchan. One of our friends was able to make a version of kimchi \"fried\" rice on the grill with the kimchi and some of the thin beef slices. I like that they also provide lettuce for wrapping meat for those who prefer to avoid rice/carbs.

Unfortunately they do not offer dessert. Regardless overall flavour to value ratio is pretty good. I would probably return with friends if in the area again in the future."}
{"text":"Toronto is such a multicultural city that one can never be surprised

A business lunch brings us here. Nothing super fancy but a place that also offers banquet seating

It's a always a good sign when the restaurant has a high ethnic guest ratio because it's does say if it's good enough for grandma Kim then it's good enough for you

I would imagine a stone bowl bap needs special bowls and a gas burner to cook properly and a rice maker on the side so cooking this at home for me is a chore

So when I eat out then this is my korean goto dish

Great food, great pricing and they bring your food out on a little cart....i feel like a king

Miso soup, 4 little appetizers and a stone bowl of chicken bap...that's a nice lunch for me"}
{"text":"A pretty standard Korean BBQ restaurant with a large menu full of Korean and Japanese options for your hungry belly. I always get the Korean BBQ meats that you cook right at the table on a charcoal grill. 

To start your meal, an assortment of banchan arrives at the table - kimchi, seaweed,  potato, peanuts with dried fish, fish cake, and pickled bok choy. Included in the Korean BBQ is a scallion/cabbage salad that's tossed with a light vinegrette, egg soup, seafood tofu stew, lettuce, bean curd dipping sauce, and 2 servings of rice. If you want more rice it's an additional cost, although I never get extra even when there's more than 2 of us. You'll be full, trust me. 

The seafood pancake is a must if you're a party of 3 or more people. It's a big pancake pan-fried with several different kinds of seafood and a heaping amount of scallions (my favourite). 

One thing I don't like is how they list their pricing. An order of meat is listed for a price of around $25-35 however you have to get a minimum of 2 orders and you aren't allowed to mix and match the various meats available. We wanted to get the bulgogi with kalbi however we were told we weren't allowed. 

The last time I was there our first waitress was impatient and even a bit rude. Her English was terrible and yet she was becoming annoyed with us because we were trying to understand what she was saying. Further on during out meal another waitress ended up serving us who was much more pleasant. 

Parking is found at the lot right outside for free. A good Korean option if you're in the area but I wouldn't travel to come here. Better and more affordable options can be found just a 15 drive further East at Yonge/Sheppard/Finch area."}
{"text":"Massive portions and the best seafood noodle bowl in the neighbourhood. Along with a diverse menu, this is definitely the Korean place to drop by if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were shopping at Square One Mall nearby when we had a craving for Korean food.  So we made our way over to Seoul House on a cold Saturday afternoon.

Seoul House restaurant offers two dining options: BBQ and Non-BBQ.  After a quick discussion when we were seated, we decided to go with the Non-BBQ.  Maybe the restaurant is better at BBQ, but I found the non-BBQ food was somewhat disappointing.

For our meal, we ordered a sizzling beef plate, a sushi bento, and a chicken soup with noodles.  The first thing we noticed when we got our sizzling beef plate was that it was not sizzling.  The beef was well cooked, but tasted somewhat bland.  The sushi bento was average, all the pieces were correctly made and tasted right, but they served a lot of rice on the sushi.  The chicken soup was warm and tasty, it was a good dish, correctly seasoned but it did not stand out..

On the decor side, the table we were seated at was close to the front door, and it got chilly whenever someone enters or leaves.  Also, there was a big wooden board covering a big part of the table, and when we lifted it to see if it could be moved, we saw that it was a big hole in the middle of the table (probably a remodeled korean BBQ table after they reduced the number of grills at the restaurant).  The wood board was sturdy and we had no issues when eating, it just felt out of place.

There were some positives, we got better than anticipated korean side dishes (a set of 5 with Kimchi, Soya beans, tofu, peanuts and brocoli) and service at the restaurant is fine. Unfortunately the lousy food and below average decor made our meal at this restaurant not too memorable.

2.3 / 5.0"}
{"text":"This place is only good to go to when it's not busy.  When it's busy, unless you are Korean, they won't give a sh!t about you waiting around to get a table.  We came here with 5 of us and there were other Korean ppl who arrived same time waiting for a table like us but the staff there just paid attention to them and not us.  We tried to ask them for a table and for how long a wait but they just looked at us, smile, and went on talking to the other Korean ppl.  Racist much?  I mean, food is good but that won't do you much if you only serve to your kind of ppl.  You're in Toronto for f@ck's sake - please learn to practice diversity."}
{"text":"Despite the negative reviews, I figured is give this a shot. Bottom line up front: save your cash and go elsewhere. 

The first clue that the place should cause worry is the extensive menu available. Too many items means less attention paid overall. Also, I've been waiting here for 20 minutes without a glass of water or tea - not an auspicious start to the dining experience. 

Second, their absolute refusal to allow you to grill the charcoal and pan grill items together. Their line is the oil falling down will cause problems. Living over 10 years in Korea and you run into no such excuses. 

Finally, the service is slow, slow, slow. The only reason it got two stars was because the food ultimately wasn't bad. But it's either their way or the highway, and their way is full of excuses to boot. No thank you."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences! Bulgogi had no taste, served with rice and veggies which were also bland and senselessly rice was put on the bottom in a very hot stone pot which burnt the rice and the whole thing was just inedible. When I took it up with the server, she says it's meant to be eaten like this, I mean give me a break this isn't my first time with Korean food. Then I showed her the burnt and chewy rice, so she immediately took the meal away and rudely brought the check, without us even asking for it. I asked her if I can order something else, she goes \"I haven't charged you for Bulgogi, please pay\". Never going back to this place and would never even recommend! (And I still paid her a tip)"}
{"text":"Came here for the 2nd time for friends bday celebration. Not a lot of places has ayce sushi and kbbq in one place. Though I might say , their kbbq are more famous than sushi. There were not many sushi selections. They only had unagis for sushi. The kbbq part was great as there are many meat selections. The salad and appetizers they had kinda balance the meal. We over ordered and the server did not charge us extra $2 each. Usually if you have leftover food , they charge each guest $2 each. The price was $25.99 + tax for weekend night per person. Service was great, server was attentive . Average for ayce. No reservations needed as they are usually not that busy"}
{"text":"This is truly a Korean restaurant because all of the staffs here are Korean. I like the meat so much!! Nice serving.
Tasty meat
But I just dont like the grill-paper."}
{"text":"Don't go there. They force you for a tip. I was gonna give them a $5 tip and then they litterly yanked a my $10 from me. I went with my friends and it's not like we're adults either. They could've respected the fact were only kids and didn't have the money. The foods okay. I highly recommend don't go there. Also the tax is very high, you might be asking for a $20 dish but in reality you will be paying close to $40 with how high the tax is."}
{"text":"Really? Not impressed with anything this place had to offer. I'm Korean and this food? Is sub par."}
{"text":"After walking around Yorkdale and catching up with an old-school friend, for some odd, strange, out-of-the-blue reason, we both ended up at the Seoul House (well she craved sushi) Anyhow firstly, it being right off Orfus Road kinda got me thinking in my head 'hope this place isn't sketchy' lol. 

The parking lot has more than enough spots, and upon walking in we were greeted and seated immediately without any delay.
The interior of this place seems a bit dull, clean, but one things for sure, its really spaced out especially the area between the booths, and tables.  You could easily maximize the space with smaller tables for two in between, but again, if this place isn't usually packed with people, then it makes sense.  The tables seemed outdated and needed to be changed. 

However the food was not bad either, we decided to go LIGHT and order three rolls; Avocado, Salmon, and Avocado cucumber.  ALL three came at once on a long slender platter, well presented, and it tasted fresh.  However, like most sushi places, its packed with a lot of rice, and at times rice-to-ingredient proportions were a bit off.  To top things, prior to receiving the bill, they served us a chilled sweet ginger-cinammon drink which was a delight.  I guess ginger helps with digestion, especially at 10pm lol.... nonetheless the experience was JUST satisfactory. Would I come back here, proabably not, as there are way too many other sushi places to try in the city. :)"}
{"text":"The food is good but the waitress definitely discriminate you if you are non-Korean.  Poor attitude."}
{"text":"Not a fan, all you can eat but really you stop before that. Electric grills (not the usual gas) meat is not marinated, and the list goes on."}
{"text":"-There is underground parking
-Food is bland
-Washrooms are clean 
-He waitresses was attentive but rude
-The place looks a little run down but it was still nice
-I would go again"}
{"text":"Good size meal, good price. Hot tea was complimentary.  I didnt count but there were 6-7 varieties of appetizers.  Quite a treat.

Only problem is service was slow, after the meal was served never saw them much and it was hard to flag them down to get the bill.  Must be end of day, will try again."}
{"text":"One thing this place needs... VENTS! When you walk into the restaurant, you are surrounded by nice and friendly smoke! You would think it's nicely vented for all the Korean BBQ going on but nope, ceiling was filled with clouds of smoke.

Onto the food, a little bit pricey for the food that you get. The taste of the food was sub par and fo sho i've had better for less price. It was nice to see that Korean food wasn't the only thing offered. Their menu consist of Japanese and Chinese food as well which, in a way made it kinda hard to decide what to order since the menu is so broad.  Don't really like Korean food and I have Chinese food all the time so I ordered Japanese food. Sashimi and sushi were fresh but for the $25 spent on my meal, I would expect to be full. 

Service, to my surprise was actually alright... maybe cause we were in the private room they have with a party of 15 people. The room was nice and had a tv in it, which was good cause UFC was on that night. Didn't like the way the food was brought. If your meal came with side dishes, they would came well after the main item instead of coming all together. Some of the food/drinks ordered were missing and had to be reminded but I don't blame them seeing how there were so many of us.

Would I come back? Sure... if all the other restaurants were wiped out in 2012 and this was the only place left."}
{"text":"I invited some people from Korea who owned Korean BBQ restaurant in Seoul. 
Whole family are visiting to Toronto. I was serious to pick up the right place to have 
a great food experience in Toronto.  We ordered Kalbi at Charcoal Table. 
It was amazing as before.  They are serving the best of best Korea Beef. Perfectly
Marinated Beef with Lettuce, Green Onion Salad, a lot of side dishes which I can not
find out any other places.   Even restaurant was full, I could feel, the server was 
trying to do the best for us.   The guest from Korea said this food quality is 
much higher than the one in Seoul.  Proud of Toronto, Seoul House at Dufferin
Thanks for giving all of us the great moment and experience."}
{"text":"I am very picky about the customer experience and the price when I consider the rating of a restaurant. My friend and I came to this restaurant at least every 2 weeks. I was about to give a 5-star for this place due to my previous experience but unlucky, it was a bad timing today. 

We ordered a sashimi bento box and a salmon stone bowl bi bim bap. The server was very friendly and energic. She quickly came with the side dishes, drinks and the utensils. Since that was a very good start, I was about giving them a 5. Then, a sushi bento box came instead of the sashimi box. That was fine that the server said I told her the wrong name since the sushi and the sashimi are fairly the same. The food portion is good for individual diners I have to admit. However, this is not the end of it. The salmon stone bowl arrived later. My friend likes seafood and fishes, so she told me that the salmon isn't fresh and taste a bit smelly. Because we come here often and usually have a good experience, I told her she may be too sensitive. The server came a few times to refill the tea for us, everything is good as usual. 

In the evening, my friend had a bad stomachache and gave it all out. I do have an intention to raise the rating since I do feel like this place a lot. We will try other dishes next time, hopefully, the issue today is an odd one."}
{"text":"Worst place ever way too expensive !!!!!

Cost so much for so little food....  

So little appetizer... Any other Korean restaurant would give so much more for the price ur paying for here..


Worst worst worst place ever ,never ever stepping in here EVER"}
{"text":"I'm going to get a couple things out of the way first...
*Service is SLOW. Slow = USPS is faster.
*Goofy Rules while ordering (like mixing grilled items).
*Lack of basic manners...like diving under the table.
*Large tour groups.

If any of the above bother you in ANY WAY...stop reading and find yourself another Korean BBQ joint.  #youhavebeenwarned

Food - 5 stars
Service - 1 star (i'd go negative if I could)
Location - 2 stars (it's in a goofy spot)

You go to Seoul House for the food, not the ambiance, service or anything of the sort...just the food.  We NEEDED great Korean BBQ and I asked a friend to recommend a place...he's Korean and had to believe his recommendation :-)

We ended up being late, really late, but that was no problem...they snagged a table for us!  As a group, we ended up ordering shrimp pancake (pajeon), a double of bulgogi, all the banchan you can think of and bibimbap.  Don't judge me and my friends...we live in a US state without amazing Korean BBQ.  

Pajeon...absolutely on point!  I could eat it all the time, crispy, flavorful, packed with shrimp.  YUM!!!

Did I mention service wasn't that great?  Well, we started grilling the meat and threw the bones on...got yelled at.  Not cool on the part of the waiter, who quickly removed the meaty bones and brought them to the \"back room\" for further cooking.  We simply didn't gnaw at the bones when they magically re-appeared some 30 minutes later (who's hungry after THAT long?).  It's hard to screw up bulgogi and these guys didn't make a mistake...fresh, sliced and seasoned just right.  A slight dip into a spicy paste...washed down with a cold, crisp beer (or tea!).  

I love rice and bibimbap is one of my favs...tasty, filling and filled with veggies and meats.  All combined into a stone bowl, drowning in flavor and spicy sauces.  DAMN that was amazing!

Like I said...you go here for the amazing food...forget the rest."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times over the past 10+ years.  It was always considered the high end Korean restaurant to go to for special occasions.  You could choose to BBQ at your table and the side dishes (pun-chun) were much better than your usual kimchee and radish sides.  
Today, there are just too many other Korean restaurants in the area that are better and cheaper.  And the last time I was there, it was pretty empty.  2 pieces of kalbi for $20.  Prior, we wouldn't have balked at this price as it was very good but this time, the meat was tough.  Service was also slow despite having hardly anyone in the place.  
 We also had a coupon for 10% off and had to argue to get the discount as the waitress (who barely spoke English, let alone read) was claiming her manager said it was invalid (which was not true).  We eventually got the discount but left with a bad taste in our mouths.  We'll just go to the strip mall next door to Song Cook where it's almost 1/2 the price, better service, better food and wider selection."}
{"text":"Cute place, very nice for the location. I'm not an expert at Korean places but I enjoyed the bibimbop. Their spider roll was delicious - real, crunchy stone crab that tasted fresh. Decent value for what we got.

Seafood bibimbop  is not a great choice if you don't like a fishy taste. The seaweed is heated by the bowl and is a bit of an overpowering flavour. I typically love shellfish but don't love cooked fish. I thought I would like this (squid, shrimp, etc - what could go wrong?) but didn't."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while and it definitely did not disappoint! The seafood pancake was especially delicious, it was thin and crispy while packed with seafood! There are lots of menu options which include table korean bbq, soups, and sizzling meat and cheese options. There will definitely be something for everyone! The service is a bit slow but the food is great so I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for korean food, I don't know why they aren't more busy! Me and the wife usually go here whenever we're craving some korean food. The service is usually really good and friendly, and the food is authentic and excellent. Some of the BBQ items can be a bit expensive though, and maybe there are better places to get that kind of thing. For everything else though, their prices and quality are solid."}
{"text":"In all honestly, we were drawn to this restaurant simply by an image of a river of melted cheese circling a central pan of chicken stirfry. The price is a little steep for what you get, with each order being $20.00 with a 2 order minimum before they even crack open the special two-sectioned pan. But I've never seen anything like it before, so we decided to go for the dual circumference experience.

The dish comes to the table with the large chunks of chicken already precooked in the kitchen on top of a bed of mixed vegetables. The circle of shredded mozzarella cheese doesn't come melted, so the whole cast iron pan gets placed on the propane gas stove and it takes a couple minutes for it to liquidize. The moment it melts, you dunk the chicken in the cheese river - picking up chunks of corn and pineapple (surprise!! there are pineapples in there!!) as you go. For pro level experience, add in some rice cakes which cook to the softest chewy delicious bite. 

If you have to have carbs, add a fried rice to your order. They wait until you've finished most of the chicken-cheese river combo, before bringing over a bowl of rice, seaweed, kimchi and veggies that gets dumped into the chicken with all it's juices. Give it a couple minutes for the bottom to crisp up a bit and dig in!! A fun experience in all, but be prepared to smell like meat and smoke for the rest of the day!!"}
{"text":"Can't give no stars unfortunately.  Worse service ever!!!   Even if you're having a bad day, you do not take it out on customers, otherwise do not work in a customer service field. One particular server does not have the mentality to be in customer service.  She should not be called sunny since she does not have a sunny disposition.   Even when she seated us, she was not friendly or welcoming.  Then telling us she forgot to place our orders only after we asked why it's taking so long (never came by to see if we needed anything or apologizing for her mistake).  And instead of offering complimentary side dishes for the wait, we had to ask for more yet she said we can't have any until our food came - seriously who says that.  After 45 minutes we asked maybe we should leave since it's taking so long and she came back giving attitude, especially since she made the mistake of not putting in our orders in the first place.  Then she threw a dish in the back for all customers to hear.  The place was not busy at all since it was before the dinner rush (four tables occupied) and only two servers yet we got stuck with her.  Of course we left even though the other lady finally came over to calm the situation.   Never again will I go to this restaurant, which was convenient for work or bring my friends and family again like yesterday.  We went to yuki restaurant across the street since we were still hungry, even though it's a sushi place they still had a bit of Korean dishes.  It was very fast and extremely friendly, especially after that incident."}
{"text":"Food here was delicious and the portions were generous. I ordered the Neangmyun (?) which is a cold noodle. There were more noodles than I could eat and the soup was very refreshing. Will definitely come back to try their other dishes.

The service was alright. The waitress seemed rude sometimes and only answered us with one or two word answers, but I believe that was because her English was not that great. Otherwise, she seemed nice."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday and I wanted to get the self-grill kalbi. I was told that there were no open grills even though there was one open. Just as the waitress said that, another table with a grill opened up and I asked if we could use either one. She said it was reserved and that we could order the kalbi dish that was EXACTLY the same except they cook it for you.
So we order, and not even 5 minutes later, a few tables with grills open up and for the rest of the night they stay open. They give some side dishes, and give us the main dishes and the rice. After eating a few pieces, we noticed that we don't have any lettuce, mix onions or bean sauce that usually come with the dish. We ask for the lettuce and they bring it to us. We ask them for the bean sauce and they give it to us. We ask for the green onions, and she says she doesn't understand(she had poor english). I mean, how can you not understand? It's the same stuff you bring out all the time, and sure enough a few mintues later she rolls out lettuce, onions, bean sauce to another table. Whatever, we're almost done eating. We ask for tea refill and we can't help but notice that other tables have many more side dishes and their own teapot. Well, the tea never comes until we ask again.
At the end, I ask the waitress how come we had less side dishes, no teapot, no lettuce, no onions, no bean sauce and she starts to explain how the self grill is a bit more expensive. I said she told us it was EXACTLY THE SAME and she keeps saying the self grill is more expensive. What about the stuff that's supposed to come with the kalbi?
Her: \"Well, we serve Koreans different than others.\"
Me: \"So you're saying that because I'm not Korean I'm being treated differently?\"
Her: \"Yes\" with a smile.
Me: \"Wow, I've never had someone be so directly racist with me before.\"
Her \"manager\" had already left so I couldn't talk to him/her, and I couldn't really be mad because the poor girl didn't even seem to understand half of what I was saying."}
{"text":"i had a class near there and i went there for lunch. OMG i wish i lived closer here so i could go everyday!! i had a beef bento, omg it was so good the beef was awesome and i liked the side dishes and my friend had a seafood soup, omg! it was so flavourful and just simply amazing! and for the prices they are amazing. my dish was about 9$ and my friend's soup was about 8$ i think"}
{"text":"Great food at very reasonable prices. We were greeted with green tea and a very clean sitting booth. My gal ordered a lovely seafood stew and myself California rolls. The food came out quickly. It was fresh and at the right temp. Accompanying our dishes were sides of miso soup and five samplings of various vegetarian fare such as kimchee and other delights. We each had a 20oz Sapporo beer served in frosty mugs. The staff were very gracious and attentive without being overly so. They serve Korean, Chinese, Japanese and Thai dishes. Highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"This places seems like a legit korean bbq place. Each table has bbq capacity and I think this is what they specialize in. We ordered kalbi and sirloin, both were delicious. The meat was very tender and tasty. They also have an assortment of good side dishes such as roasted peanuts, pickled radish, bean sprouts, kimchi sweetened soy potatoes, and seaweed. The bbq comes with one complimentary soup. I thought the spicy tofu soup taste just ok.. it was a bit sour maybe from the kimchi, really throws off the taste. 

The atmosphere was nice, it's not as busy and noisy as other bbq restaurants, and each table has a vent on top of the grill for ventilation. Price was slightly higher than others for kbbq, about $60 for two portions. 

Overall good experience. Would recomment for authentic kbbq"}
{"text":"Their pork bone soup is pretty good. For $8.99 you can't go wrong.  We wanted to try the BBQ but it's costly because they require a minimum order of 2 of each kind of meat. WHAT?? $25/portion so minimum $50 is just too much. Service is pretty good, not anything special but good. We keep coming back..it's close to Yorkdale and the food is not bad."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by here for lunch on our warehouse shopping day.  The restaurant is quite big for a Japanese/Korean place. They have a pretty extensive menu that includes Korean, Japanese and Chinese dishes (with a Korean twist). My friend and I both ordered Bento Boxes from the lunch menu.

When you first walk in, there is a sitting area on the left, which appears more casual the sitting area on the right. The right side had booths, and in between the two dining areas were the kitchen and the bar. Near the back just to the right of the restrooms, is a private room with one large table that seats possibly 20 people or more from what I saw. Another interesting feature that we noticed were the swivel seats on the chairs. It was somewhat busy during their lunch hour, but there were several empty tables.

The food was good. We ordered a spicy salmon roll ($5.99) which was great and I would order it again. My friend ordered the teriyaki salmon bento box ($8.99) and I ordered the sushi and tempura bento box ($13.99). Both meals came with miso soup and salad.  Since this is primarily a Korean restaurant, we also got three small side dishes of kimchi, green beans, and I believe radishes. The bento boxes were filling and the sushi pieces were a good size, not too small.

The prices were slightly higher than average, especially for items that were not on the lunch menu. I did not see an \"AYCE\" Korean BBQ menu, but there is Korean BBQ available at various prices based on what you order.

I would probably come back here if I were in the area again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for homey-vibe, this is your place! The portions are larger than most places, the taste unchanging and the service quick.

On this visit, my friends and I ordered common offerings - bulgogi bibimbap, gamjatang (pork bone soup) and tteokbukki to share. As per usual, the meal comes with an array of banchans (side dishes) like green beans, cabbage kimchi, stir fried fish cakes, eggplants in soy sauce and peanuts with anchovies."}
{"text":"I usually come here with a big group for Kbbq. This visit, there was 5 of us, since it's a Monday night, it's a bit quieter than other times I've visited.

We ordered AYCE Kbbq and chose A course which includes different types/cuts of meats, salads, noodles, maki rolls and soup. 

- free parking in the garage
- servers are friendly 
- convenience of a call button on your table
- Korean alcohol are available

The servers were helpful and attentive and would give generous serving of meat or whatever else we needed."}
{"text":"Great service and lots of space. With so many Korean BBQ in the area, those two points really stand out. 

Food was good although it may be a bit higher than other Korean BBQs. Ordered two beefs and a pork belly. Pork belly wasn't as good as piggys and one of the beef was really tender while a second order wasn't as good. 

But the fact that I didn't need to wait to be seated, had Lots of space so I didn't need to be crowded or lean in to listen to my guests, really made a difference. Nearby kobi was loud and crowded with limited parking. Seoul house was much better to access. And the servers were very friendly and prompt with their service. 

It's an older restaurant but I will definitely be back. 

3.5 stars out of 5.

The servers are horribly rude
There are a lot other options in Toronto 
Unfortunately this will be my last time here 
Dirty and rude service never a good thing"}
{"text":"I had mixed feelings about this place. The service was great, but I'm gonna need to come back and try their korean bbq before adjusting my rating. The Bibimbop was nothing special, although the pork in it was quite succulent."}
{"text":"I'm Korean and I've been to many Korean restaurants in Toronto, Korea and other parts of the world. This is one of my favourites for BBQ so I'm surprised it doesn't have better reviews. The quality of the meat and wide variety of side dishes always has me coming back despite the prices."}
{"text":"Maybe 2.5*

Say it isn't so, but they *may* have changed owners/chefs??  It's been a while since my last visit, but I was less than impressed on my most recent lunch visit.

Hwe Dup Bap was a large portion, but primarily Romaine lettuce and only 2 kinds of raw fish...which wasn't quite yet stank, but not the freshest.  No real flavour.  :(  $13.99, so I suppose I get what I paid for?

I hope that this was just a one-off.  Service was fine, but I didn't recognise this waitress which strengthens my suspicion about changing owners."}
{"text":"I have lots of reasons why I gave this place a 2/5. I'll just list them to make it easier.

- You must use a piece of parchment paper on top of the grill which rids the meat of 'crispiness'

- Wayyyyy too overpriced for the 'all you can eat' option.

- very messy and cluttered restaurant (I would even consider it dirty.) 

- servers do not know how to handle even a small amount of customers. (With about only three tables filled- two servers could hardly manage.) 

- they forced a tip upon me. The server hovered as we paid in hopes to make us uncomfortable to leave a large tip.

- I saw a bug (unsure of what it was - but it did not look nice- not to mention I read another review about someone else seeing bugs (ew) ) 

- the food made me and the people I dined with sick afterwards. 

The only truly good comment I have about this place is the plating - sushi looked very nice and other menu items came nicely prepared."}
{"text":"I went back on my word never to put my kundungi in that place ever again - and succumbed, out of desperation.

Will start with the negatives and then the positives (few that there are).

Cons:
+++++
1.  Tables were sticky.  Unappealing!!!
2.  Hostess who \"greeted us\" (same person who I recall from a long time ago is as dour as ever).  Some things in life never change;

Pros:

1.  Server(s) (two) were polite;

2.  Salmon sashimi was well-cut.  Soya sauce rough and not of a good quality (IMO);
3.  Mul nyengmyeon had the perfect amount of stretchiness to the noodles and the broth was perfectly balanced;

ALSO:  Kimchi from a package and not home made.  Other panchan lacklustre and tasteless (peanuts were a nice touch, but without dried anchovies - huh)?

Not my first choice unless I am totally desperate.  Its is expensive for what it is.  Tea opsayo.  $40.00+ down the proverbial drain."}
{"text":"Came here again with a group of four. 
The food is still great. 
The service was okay but this time when we were about to pay the waitress demanded we give her tips right when she gave us the bill....I find that a little impolite"}
{"text":"Got sent up a table near the Sushi Bar, very dusty area... Got the menus... Waited for someone to take our order... waited... waited... old man was continuously serving others and seemingly ignoring us after we kept on trying to get his attention... so we just got up left"}
{"text":"The food is very tasty (ordered the Kalbi BBQ & chicken pancake), the staff would cook it for you, although I question the hygiene standards as they use the same tong to pick up the raw meat as they do the cooked meat.  Nice selection of side dishes although I wasn't a big fan of a couple of them (personal preference of ingredients). 

Throughout the entire meal there were flies everywhere and crawled onto the side of the plates and our cups - was NOT a good experience. 

Way overpriced for what it is. 

Food 4/5

Value 2.5/5
Service 3/5
Cleanliness 1/5"}
{"text":"We went to Seoul House and had the Korean barbecue... My friend did the barbecuing and it was excellent... will definitely go back again..."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place as I heard a lot of good things. The all you can eat KBBQ is delicious and flavorful but the only difference at this KBBQ is that you need to grill the meat on a sheet of baking paper which doesn't make the meat have the \"grilled and crispy\" taste. Although, the meat and other dishes were really good, the sushi nevertheless was surprising. The menu is bigger than Korean Grill House and definitely higher quality. 

The service was terrible. To get a waiter and order food took a very long time as there are very few staff. They also tend to forget a lot of your orders and need to be constantly reminded. 

Overall, besides the disappointing service, the food was good and beyond my expectations. I would revisit to eat but it would not be a place to hang out with some friends and catch up or recommend to others."}
{"text":"WORST KBBQ AYCE EVER.
Few items on the menu, a little pricey for the limited items that you can get, crappy service, employees give you an attitude, & in the end have the guts to forcefully ask you for no less than $5 tip. 


Twas our first time and we will NOT definitely come back. So disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered Kalbi, marinated and non-marinated ones. They came with an egg pudding, many side dishes, green lettuce, many sauces, soybean stew and bowls of rice. Everything was okay. Marinated Kalbi may have contained some MSG, because I felt my tongue freeze during the meal. We also got some cold buckwheat noodles to finish the meal. I liked the noodles. They were fresh and sweet. They also serve you complimentary cold tea called Su-jung-gua. Service was okay. Male servers did a great job (e.g. cutting the meat very well for us, and bringing us what we asked for promptly) while one of the female staff was forgetful (e.g. we had to repeat our additional order of a can of beer and extra green leaf lettuce, and she brought us what we didn't order) and unprofessional (e.g. she went to greet other customers in the middle of cutting the meat for us). Overall, it was a decent Korean BBQ experience. In terms of authentic Korean BBQs, I prefer Sariwon or Piggy's Restaurant in Thornhill."}
{"text":"This restaurant is overpriced for no apparent reason. Went there a couple of times, once for sushi which were plain average and pricey and one time for Korean. First of all the staff there only for getting the dishes to the table, no extra tea or a change of side dishes after they run out, took 15 mins to get a bill. The food (except from the grilling table menu where everything is at 40$ tag) is blunt and not a good representation of hearty Korean food. It is also highly overpriced, be ready for entree orders to set you back 20$ pp, their chigae was tasteless and bo ssam was dead cold. Also only get 4 side dishes, which were never renewed. Overall if you are considering going out for real Korean food try other places like Nak Won or other grills."}
{"text":"Nice clean place, not small and tight like many korean places. Six bowls of panchan that they refilled when asked, we had the dol sul bib bim bap with pork which was very good, intestine soup (not my fav') those who like it thought it was great, sushi roll was good all in all very nice."}
{"text":"if you are here for all-u-can-eat then ok but not if you care about the quality, all meats tasted the same and they did not have Korean beef short ribs...wtf, service was also slow and they limited us on the fish cake side dishes. sushi choices were also very limited to only 5 choices and was filled with mad rice no fish"}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a kid and as of recently their Korean BBQ to me is definitely top 3 in the city....if you think otherwise, you're honestly trash. I'm gonna actually say it's my favourite right now. All their side dishes (ban Chan) are authentic and delicious, their galbi marinade is ON POINT. Korean BBQ is all about the small things next to the Main event (if you're Korean pull understand) Their service has been so good the past few times I've gone. They cook their meat on a charcoal grill so the flavours are so much better ! Their soy bean soup that comes with the BBQ is one of the best I've had. Also the last time I went the manager gave us a massive plate sized Korean \"pizza\" on the house as a service! I"}
{"text":"Just came back from this horrible restaurant. 
We made a reservation for dinner with my whole family with my future in-laws. 
We chose this restaurant primarily for the table cooking, which had been informed already when making reservation. 

We ordered 4 'Bulbogi' to be cooked at table, 2 Seafood and 2 Kimchi pancakes to start-off. 
When they brought over the meat, it was just a regular Bulbogi already cooked in kitchen on a sizzling plate x4. 
We told them we ordered meat for table cooking (hence why we were seated at this cooking table), and the waitress just kept on saying we ordered the sizzling plate not BBQ meat. 
Then she told us to just keep the dishes as it already came out and then she will bring out raw meat for table cooking. We told her 'no' as it would be too much food at this point and they should take back the dish as that's not what we ordered. 
She became really rude and started talking in a sarcastic voice to just keep the dish. No apologies. 

My dad did not want to cause a scene as it was our first dinner with the future in-laws so we just ate it. They didn't even bring out rice that comes with Bulgogi until we asked for them. 
2 of the seafood pancakes came out, but 2 kimchi ones never did and was charged on our bill.

The waitress didn't admit to her mistake, and basically told us 'too bad, just eat it'. 
No effort to correct the mistake. Even the lady that was sitting by the entrance that seemed like the owner didn't bother to jump in and correct the mistake. Just sat and watched everything.
The waitress tried to make it up by bringing out miso soups for everybody which nobody drank, and sounded like she was doing us a favour. 

The food was mediocre at best, price is over-priced compared to other Korean restaurants, and side dishes just weren't that good. There was nothing good about this restaurant, and does not even deserve 1 star.  
I would not recommend anyone going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is alright, but holy shit the service is so shit, it seems like a family owned restaurant and they have their relatives as waitresses hence they think they don't have to act professional but holy crap did their service ruin my meal."}
{"text":"Last night, I had a fabulous dinner with family friends. There was about 12 people. Although we only made a reservation for 9, they made great accommodations for us. 

We ordered quite a couple of dishes. We ordered the sweet and sour pork. This is one of my all-time favourite dishes and the only place I get it is at seoul house. 

We also ordered the black dragon, another one of my favourites. They were very big and satisfying. 

We also had some kalbi. We had both grilled and self grilling kalbi. I would definitely recommend the self grilled but both were delicious. 

Overall, we had a great meal and an amazing experience. I will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, we we're told they changed cook and from what I tasted, definitely deserves more stars than what is showing now."}
{"text":"Ordered the pork bone soup here. I think it wasn't authentic enough... The broth tasted too plain - missing the pork bone taste and spicyness that I was yearning for. I wouldn't order this again if I came here.
My two other friends ordered the bibimbap and the black bean sauce noodle and appeared to have enjoyed it. I'd likely get the bibimbap next time. 
Service is decent. Restaurant located in plaza so there's adequate parking here."}
{"text":"We were unsure of what to precisely expect but we're pleasantly surprised. Plenty of food with four adults and two meat trays at a charcoal with gas grill on the table. So much is included but not laid out by menu or staff (they knew but did not articulate). 

All in, we enjoyed the meal and were filled just right. Our littlest one got some wasabi in error and the wait staff were very accommodating of our error. Still has lots of side dishes left as sauces."}
{"text":"Nothing is more comforting to have a meat feast for Carnivores, especially when they were deprived and hungry because they were eating at an Izakaya where everything are smallish.. and not filling. 

Seoul House Korean Japanese Restaurant is really a Korean restaurant.. and is really more a BBQ restaurant.. as all the tables are equipped with a gas bbq....so don't come here for sushi..... come here for their meat or their Korean dishes. 

Open late! Till 12 pm. So perfect for after dinner snack as in our case. 

Marinated Beef Back Ribs ($24.99) min of 2 orders serves with miso soup, purple rice and banchans 
- I love how they put the real charcoal underneath the grill.. so you has the real smokey charcoal taste while the meat cooking.. and yes it does make a difference 
- The beef was nicely marinated.. with good proportion of fat and lean meat..so every piece was nice and tender.. The only complain is the slices were a little thin... if they were thicker cut, then it will for sure give them a better bite! 

Nice Korean Mama Style waitress... minimum conversations, a lot of smile..... She was hiding somewhere at the back most of the time, so we did not get much services after she set us up with the grill and she did come back and put in a new grill for us when we ready to cook the 2nd time around. 

Excellent ventilation system.. I didn't smell like a piece of meat after I finish eating here.. that's always a plus! 

I think I am going on a Carb free diet with all the meat I have been eating... but at least they are good tasting meat!"}
{"text":"Korean food was one of my favorite XD
Cannot say no to GamchaTang and kimchi. The price was very reasonable and you can get a HUGE dish"}
{"text":"Was super impressed with this Korean BBQ and I am continually in Korean restaurants. First, having the proper flame/heating is great. The meat is of great Korean BBQ quality and they provide you with the banchan and assessories you need. I've heard this place has been around since the beginning of time (or at least in terms of being a Korean restaurant in that neighborhood of Toronto) and that certainly makes sense. 

You will need 2 portions of meat for 2 people along with some rice, which came to about $57.00 ($65.00 with tip). Definitely go with the Rib meat as it is the best one there!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after a 3 year hiatus. Hey, the food isn't bad! I got the japchae, which was a bit salty but otherwise it was pretty good. Oh and it could've used more beef. The pork cutlet my fiancee got was huge and only $11! The meat was super thin but the sauce was good. All in all, the food is okay. Definitely passable. The service is kind of rushed and plain spoken."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad. It wasn't too busy when arrived for a weekend dinner. We ordered a few portions of Korean BBQ meat. I prefer the marinated meat that they use. It also came with soft tofu stew, which was pretty good. They also give you some egg dish and a lot of side dishes. The cold noodle soup at the end that we added on was pretty good as well. My only complaint is the service made a bunch of mistakes and abruptly left our table in the middle of helping us to greet customers that just arrived. Overall, not a bad place to have some Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place got 3 out 5 stars cus this place is pretty freaking amazing!

The meat is delish, the portions were big and the staff was nice. 

Loved the pork and Bulgogi.  It was soooooo yummy.  The chicken with the melted cheese Corn was also the bomb.

I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"We wait for at least 15 mins, one girl comes by give us water, then that's it.  Then we wait wait wait...till so disappointed, then we just left. Btw the table is not clean, greasy..over all, don't go!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat for lunch with their lunch specials! Definitely can fill the hungriest customers! We ordered the kalbi beef and bulgogi I. I wish the bulgogi came in spicy but it was delicious overall. This came with tea, miso soup and a full bento tray. Truly an authentic Korean experience. On a side note, this establishment offers a variety of Japanese cuisine as well. Notably takoyaki which was quite good. 

I would only have to say, their service is slow and I had to ask for tea quite a few times."}
{"text":"It's pretty serious all you can eat, you will enjoy the meal, but not enjoy how you feel about yourself afterwards.

Definitely not first date material and make sure you wear loose fitting clothing. 

Tip: ditch the parchment paper and cook straight on the grill."}
{"text":"We went in for dinner, 2 of us at the hot table. It took them 30 minutes to come and ask us if we even wanted a drink, they didn't bring us water. I was ready to get up and leave it took so long for them to come. When they finally did, we decided we were going to order everything right away as it took so long for the.  To come the first time. They turned on our table, brought the food, forgot about the drinks, had to wait until almost half way through the meal for them to approach us again and I asked them to bring our drinks, the waitress looked at me like I was crazy, and I said we ordered two drinks with the food. It was like she didn't believe me. The food was great, not that they cook it. No complaints about the meal though. When we asked for the bill it took them almost 20min to bring the receipt and it was not even busy, only 3 other tables and at least 5 staff that I saw. I was very unimpressed. I will not go back here. Service is everything to me."}
{"text":"I love sushi, so I ordered a Gyoza, Spicy Salmon Roll and Salmon Sashimi all 3 came up to ~$22. It was probably the worst sushi I ever had lol. As for the other food, well I didn't try, but the prices are pretty steep for food that you can easily get at other places for a lot cheaper and better tasting."}
{"text":"First time trying the spicy pork bibimbap and it was so good! I will most likely come again. The only disappointment was that the kimchi was too spicy for me but other than that, it was pretty good."}
