{"text":"I should have read the reviews before coming here. The food was very disappointing. I barely even touched the food. I would not recommend anyone to come here. It's very expensive, considering it was just \"instant\" ramen. Thanks again, boo ramyun."}
{"text":"Probably one of the poorest service we had ever received from a restaurant.. Me and my girlfriend waited over five minutes after we got seated to receive a menu. After ten minutes of waiting to get a waiter's attention so we can order our food, I ended up walking to the cashier to tell the that waiter we need someone to take our order. We also had to ask the waiter twice to get two glasses of water because she forgot the first time. They do not provide any side dishes like most korean restaurants do which we were really disappointed in. The raynum (which only had about three pieces of tiny pork) was not that good nor the bibimbop as the beef did not taste like it was marinated at all. My girlfriend ended up pouring the soup into her bowl of food because there was no flavor. We would not recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Tried the Corn Cheese Ramyun... This seemed to be white alfredo sauce, chicken, and corn niblets on a bed of instant noodles. I think I ordered poorly but I don't blame the kitchen staff, because honestly, if I wanted noodles with pasta sauce, I really shouldn't have ordered it from a place that serves Korean food, right?"}
{"text":"Walked by Mo'Ramyun the other day since I was attracted by its funny name. TBH the pictures of the ramen crusted chicken wings drew me closer but we didn't order it at all! Based on other reviews, we decided to go with a big bowl of classic Mo Ramyun and the 1/2 1/2 cheesy ribs and wings. Oooooooooh man, the ribs were thick and fall off the bone juicy goodness and the wings were smaller than what I'm used to, but had great flavour. The cheese was also a nice touch, although it would have been better if it was more melty. Next time I'm gna try it with more ribs. Definitely better than some other rib and cheese places in the city! 
The bowl of ramen was so delicious, stacked w loads of veggies, thick pork belly, pieces of chicken, melty soft boiled egg, and lots and lots of noodles in a spicy soup! Perfect for a cold day! It was not busy when we went on a Sunday afternoon, so service was prompt. Small clean place. Right at the corner of Baldwin st. I'm definitely going back next time for their wings!! Great Korean fusion food! :)"}
{"text":"Ramen was so good and nice big quantity. Staff is very friendly. We ordered the mo ramyun and the rice cake/dumpling ramyun and the chicken. All delicious."}
{"text":"Awfully slow service is all I can say! Won't be coming back again. The employees inside does not know what they're doing. Came here on a weekday and there was one table inside and completely dead.

Including my table, 2 tables in the restaurant at 7 pm at night! After coming here I can see why.

Poor service. Restaurant is very unsanitary and gross. The entrance of the restaurant had spider webs and looks like no one bothered to clean since it opened. 

The food looked nothing like the photo. The taste was a disappointment!!"}
{"text":"Food 3.5/5 (50% of final grade)
Got the half ribs half wings on a skillet with cheese. The cheese slowly toasted in the skillet, forming a wonderful thick soup of stretchy, savoury lactose. Thought the cheese did not bind with the chicken nor the ribs, it did give the dish a contrast in texture. The wings at regular spice level were an appropriate spiciness, but the saltiness overwhelmed the taste of the cheese (so I could practically only chew the texture of the cheese). My friend and I also ordered kimchi poutine that was surprisingly good. We also tried their house wings with the ramen coating, and THAT was very yummy. If you come here, definitely try the house wings if nothing else. The cheese makes you feel incredibly stuffy afterwards though. Expect about 3 cups of melted cheesiness from a skillet for two.

Ambience 3/5 (15% of final grade)
This place was really small, and although it wasn't particularly dirty, it didn't feel really clean either. I mean, this IS a pub at night, so I can understand why. The washrooms were really nice though, with mouthwash and even hand lotion (lol). Not sure why they put so much effort in the washrooms instead of other parts of the restaurant, but it's still nice to have a good-looking washroom. This place is best for small groups of 4 and under. So a nice drink at night with friends would pair well with the house wings.

Service 3.5/5 (15% of final grade)
Cups were filled with water quite attentively, and the ladies working there had nice smiles and polite mannerisms :)

Cost 2/5 (10% of final grade)
For the quality it was pretty reasonable, but the quantity for the house wings and its price was sad. Nothing very intimidating though.

Brownie Points 2.5/5 (10% of final grade)
I didn't expect the lady server to chat with us at all, because this was an east-asian establishment (no offense at all, just that east-asian restaurants usually use speed instead of service to impress). But chat with us she did near the end of the meal (thinking back, it might have been for more tips, since we were about to get the bill, but whatever, it felt genuine enough).

Final Grade = 63.5/100 = 3 shiny (pleasantly) greasy stars!

TLDR: Not a priority to revisit, but might crave those house wings once in a while. Too long a trek from where I live to go on a usual basis though. If it's within at 15 minute drive, go for it! If not, then maybe go somewhere closer :)"}
{"text":"It was like a russian roulette when ordering, what you expect might not be what you will be getting. Very slow service, we waited more than half an hour for our food to come. The menu description didn't do justice describing some of their dish. 

Please remember that everything is ramyun/ramen noodles based. We had their spicy noodles, creamy noodles, chicken cutlet, and ramen fried chicken. The spicy noodles was bearable, barely any meat. The creamy noodles, just no, it was Italian fettucini but with ramen noodles. Ramen fried chicken was a one time gimmick, nothing special. Out of the three main dishes my fave was the chicken cutlet because it came with strawberry slices, yum!"}
{"text":"I come here regularly and the server named Blair always makes me feel welcome and provides excellent customer service. Whenever I am unsure, I can always count on Blair  to give recommendations on what dish to order.The food comes quickly and the portion size is enormous.The excellent customer experience that this restaurant offers and its staff will always make me come back."}
{"text":"Armsphere is great. We ordered the half and half with rice cakes and corns. It was very delicious. Only thing just that the cheese got melted and very quickly burnt on the bottom and made the wings and rice cakes burnt too. But it was good. The dressing on the salad was awesome"}
{"text":"This little shop is high-value, the portion sizes are HUGE. Nothing too adventurous, but deeply satisfying and always super fresh. Sometimes the food can take quite a while, which I don't suppose they can help given their traffic during peak times. They have a lovely patio in the summer, though if you're too hot, the AC is on blast inside. The seafood ramyun is meh, and their chicken wings are kind of strange au sujet de the sauces. What is with Toronto and the absence of decent chicken wing sauce?"}
{"text":"I definitely did not think the ramen bowl would be that big!  Got the Mo Ramyun and I certainly could not finish it. The meal just reminded me of those Paldo or nongshim spicy instant noodle packs except with a lot of veggies and a fair amount of meat and much spicier. Good thing I love instant noodles! Meal tasted fantastic BUT I personally found that they put too much cabbage into it. I know, more veggies should be good but it's not good anymore if you just taste more cabbage than anything else with every bite.

Service was good. Waitress refilled our water frequently and was very friendly.

Overall, it's a really convenient place for students to eat since it's close to the university. Tasty if you like huge portions instant noods."}
{"text":"Came here several times and ordered all kinds of dishes. Both the environment and the food are enjoyable! It's a wonderful place to have dinner with friends to chat and relax when after class or finish the exam.. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Very  curl up in a ball rainy cold day outside kind of food. Nice place to get some korean comfort food, service is really good too. Definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"Cheese + table cooked meat seems like all the rage now in modern Korean food. And indeed the combination of chili paste, cheese, and meat is hard to refuse. They have other dishes too but their pork ribs/chicken wings table cooked with cheese is definitely their most iconic food. They have some fusion ramyun too but nothing too special about those imo. 

Price wise I think they could shave off $1-2 here and there but overall it's not terribly expensive. It's more expensive than your traditional dishes for sure.

Would I come again? Maybe."}
{"text":"This place was good. I would come here again if it came up, but I wouldn't recommend it over some other places. I got the Don-Gol Ramyun, and it was good but I wasn't amazed - at the same time though, I think I would have liked it more if I had gotten a different kind; I think I just got the wrong choice for me. My friend got the spicy cheese pork ribs and chicken wings and those were really good, I would definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the spicy pork ribs~ The proportions for the ribs are huge though, so it's definitely a shared dish. The Ginseng Chicken Ramyun is a bit too sweet though, but that's likely due to the strong taste of Ginseng. It was interesting how it came with some honey. I was actually quite confused the first time and didn't know you were supposed to add it to the noodles. I would recommend Ramyun to anyone who enjoys Korean noodles! The dumplings were also very good."}
{"text":"Mo' Ramyun is a really cute Korean fusion restaurant with unique menu items. I've been really excited to eat here after seeing so many pictures on Instagram. Each table had a sticker with the wifi name and password which I thought was really nice because I'm always too shy to ask for wifi passwords! They also let you tag @Mo.Ramyun on Instagram and @Mo'Ramyun on Facebook for 5% off your bill. Even though I knew this, I forgot to do it :(

My friend and I got the Spicy Cheese Pork Ribs and Chicken Wing combo and the Mo' Ramyun bowl. They both come in mild, regular, spicy, and extra spicy. We got the regular for both and thought it was pretty spicy so maybe start with mild if you can't handle spice! 

The Spicy Cheese Pork Ribs and Chicken Wing combo was a really interesting dish! The serving for 2 people was $29.95. They bring you a gas burner and a pan of pork ribs, chicken wings, shredded cheese and corn kernels. To eat this, you're supposed to wait for the flame to heat up the pan and melt the cheese. Then you dip the wings and ribs into the cheese like fondue. It's a really cool combination but getting the cheese on the meat is a difficult process. We had to use our chopsticks to wrap the cheese around the meat. I wouldn't order this again but I do recommend it because the flavours are unique. I think it's nice that they give you plastic gloves to wear while eating so your hands don't get dirty. If you get this, make sure to turn the heat down after the cheese has melted. We made the mistake of leaving it on high so the cheese eventually crusted and we couldn't dip anymore. However, fried cheese is still quite delicious!

The Mo' Ramyun bowl was just okay. It came with pork belly, egg, and assorted vegetables. The serving was really big but it tasted like something I could make at home by adding meat and vegetables to a pack of instant noodles. I didn't mind too much though because since we ordered during happy hour (2-5pm), we got this for $9 instead of $13.95. I don't recommend this. 

Overall, I give this restaurant a 3.5. Although the dishes were really unique and satisfying, I wouldn't go back to get them again. If you decide to try out this restaurant, it's best to go before dinner time so it's not too busy. We arrived just before 5 pm and were seated right away but when we left at 6:30, there was a line out the door."}
{"text":"The soup in their ramyun can be REALLY SPICY. I was super surprised when I went here for a friend's birthday. Turned my face red in front of everyone and left me gasping for air. Needless to say, I've came back for it. 

Get the bulgogi (beef) ramyun; lots of beef on top with good flavours. The fried tofu is pretty good too.

They also have a bar and a giant TV for sports. Decent place for evening out."}
{"text":"I enjoyed dining here.  The venue is located on the corner of Baldwin street, which lends to a nice view.  It has seating in the front and the back as well as seating on tall tables and a tall counter.  The place was clean and had a relaxed, cozy atmosphere.  The service was friendly and you get 5% off your bill if you post a picture and tag them on facebook or instagram.

Price is $10-15 dollars.  I ordered the Mo' Ramen which has chicken, egg, pork belly, bak choy, mushroom in a 2 star spicy sauce.  Ramen had a nice density and there had to be at least two cups of cooked ramen in the soup.  The portion is hefty and definitely filling!"}
{"text":"We came upon this new restaurant by accident.  What a pleasant surprise.  We ordered the special cheese pork ribs for two and it was great!  But my wife also wanted their Dduk Ramyun which we also ordered and hence I ate way too much!

Great food, great service!  Highly recommended.

We will be back."}
{"text":"tried the ramen, poutine, and this time we had spicy cheesy chicken wing/rib pot.
i liked the ramen and poutine better, the cheesy pot was actually very spicy- beware!"}
{"text":"Convenient lunch/dinner location near the major downtown hospitals for all sorts of crowds. I've been here a few times and overall satisfied and even occasionally impressed with the taste and portion sizes of the main dishes, but still have to settle with 3/5 stars due to the crappy ambiance, lack of decent vegetarian options and virtually no vegan options.

Food- 3/5. Do order their ramen here as that is what Mo' Ramyun is known for and for a good reason! This time we ordered the signature Mo' Ramyun main, which was huge and topped with a plethora of fresh veggies and meat, but unfortunately was really spicy. The ramen used looked like Mr. Noodles, which isn't necessarily a bad thing... omg nostalgia :P I ordered the vegetarian Dolsot Bibim Bap, which came with chopped egg and fried tofu along with different vegetables. Miso soup also came with this, but was so salty. I added an extra $1 to swap to brown rice. It was quite filling, but was pretty bland, so I really had to rely on the hot sauce condiment for flavor.

Ambiance- 1/5. I feel like they have so much potential to turn the restaurant into a more hip or more classy or more traditional ramen bar, but instead most of the furnishings demonstrate a lack of effort and central concept. They do have a full bar, pub food, and a TV, which make at least part of the restaurant pretty casual and fun, but since the space is not that big, the family/group tables are immediately behind the bar, which dampens the bar atmosphere. It's also pretty loud here on weekend evenings, but relatively empty at lunchtime. At least the washrooms are clean."}
{"text":"Really good, solid Ramen. I ordered the three dumplings, delicious, probably got a bit too spicy of a broth, but overall very tasty. The noodles tasted suspiciously like the Mr noodles days in the past, but no complaints. Stuff is delicious. Was told to order the bibimbap next time. Noted. Mo! Ramyun! I come back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on the popular Baldwin street where there are a lot of restaurants. I came here with my Korean friend for lunch. I've been a few times and I like their food. The have different kinds of Korean fusion type foods. I ordered the Mo' Ramyun which has 1.5 pork belly, egg & assorted vegetables. The restaurant was busy during lunch when we went but it didn't too long before we got our food. The ramen was good and flavorful. I loved the fried pork belly, it was definitely different then the fatty pork belly that I love to eat. They always have this social media aspect where if you post a picture of yourself with their food and use their hashtag, you get 5% off your bill which isn't too bad. Overall, a decent restaurant if you want to grab a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Would have given 3.5 stars. I chose this place because I love noodles. I ordered the kimchi Ramyun, and my boyfriend ordered the Jajang Myun. 
Kimchi Ramyun - I loved the noodles, but there were too many bean sprouts to my taste; it felt like there was the same amount of bean sprouts as the noodles. The broth was too spicy for me even though I ordered mild. 
Jajang Myun - tasted good, but the portion was small. My bf was still hungry after finishing it. 
Otherwise, the restaurant has a good atmosphere and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The price is okay and the service is nice, but the thing that I can't forget about is the good food. It's definitely a good place to share some good wings."}
{"text":"If you're a cheese and spicy korean food fan, you'll be hooked. Like all the fellow yelpers mentioned, the cheese-ribs-wings combination is to die for, super chewy and gooey cheese, tender and flavourful ribs. The chicken wings were on the thinner side (not much meat) but still very good. This dish also need to be eaten ASAP because the cheese will burn if you leave it on the stove for too long and if you take it off the stove, it will harden and then you wont be able to warp it around your meat anymore.

We also got the creamy ramyun and the ramyun coated chicken wings. I wasn't too big of a fam of the ramyun coated wings, tasted a bit burnt and dry for me. The creamy ramyun was just as promised: very creamy and was perfect paired with the spiciness of the cheesy ribs. 

Price is a bit on the higher end: we paid $80 for two (but we also ordered way too much food). I would say it would cost about $30 per pax incl tax and tips."}
{"text":"The ramyun noodles is really good. Kimchi fries is a must try! Takoyaki is good too. 

Service is good, food is good. Good find!"}
{"text":"Good food a little pricy. It was fresh and didn't take long to come. Service was good and quick, water was always full. The restaurant itself clean and well maintained. The seating was really good and comfortable."}
{"text":"Great service, but the food was disappointing. I love Baldwin Village and wanted to try a out a new restaurant with my friend. We were quickly seated by the window and I fell in love with the sunlight reflecting on the table. I ordered the Don-gol Ramyum and assumed that it would be like any other ramen. There was also a sticker on the table with the wifi name and password. I thought this was very convenient as you don't need to go out of your way to ask the waitress if there's wifi or not and so on. It didn't take long for the food to come and it honestly looked delicious! However, I was shocked to discover that the dish was mostly filled with vegetables and it only came with two pieces of meat. The meat was very chewy and made the experience slightly unpleasant. The vegetables weren't very flavorful and overlapped the noodles. The noodles tasted very good at first, but it quickly became quite plain and reminded me of instant noodles. It took me a long time to finish my meal as it began to taste worse and worse as I ate more of the dish. I most likely will not come back in the future."}
{"text":"Not so good food and bad service. The food is more expensive than it should be, plus it's not yummy like other Korea restaurant"}
{"text":"Honestly I'd give 5 stars just for the spicy cheese ribs. BUT this time I ordered the ramen and guys... Don't keep your hopes up for these noodles. The visuals are nice but taste is \"It's in front of me so I'll eat it\"

Will be back for the ribs though!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"2.5/5, +.5 for service

Mo'Ramyun used to be called McRamyun before, you guessed it, McDonald's complained about their name and they had to change it to Mo'Ramyun. Either way, it's a Korean fusion restaurant in Baldwin Village with your typical Korean staples and snacks.

I arrived here for lunch recently as I've been past this place a couple of times and it intrigued me a bit. I've always liked ramyun, except the fact I dislike the spiciness that comes with it. Looking at the menu beforehand, there were some ramyun items that interested me which weren't spicy at all, so I decided to give this place a try.

I had the Don-Gol Ramyun, which was supposedly a thick pork/chicken broth with garlic, pork belly, and pickled radish. The garlic came separate, which is nice if you're not someone who likes a lot of garlic in their soups. For $10.95, however, I expected a little bit more from what I got. The pork belly was decent and the ramyun was average (felt more like instant noodles though), but the broth was not thick at all and a bit on the salty side. I can understand pork bones being a bit on the salty edge, but that was way too salty for my liking.

For what it's worth, service was excellent and the workers really do try to make you feel welcome. I might consider trying other items, but given the options around the area this will not be my first choice to revisit."}
{"text":"The actual score I think is 2.5/5...
I guess it has ok food, but I would not recommend this place. 
I really wanted to try the ramen fried chicken wings, but that actually tasted really bad. The chicken felt like that it's not seasoned at all, and the batter.... I don't know what is going on, but it just has a really weird texture. It is thick so that dried ramen pieces would actually stick, but it felt like glue. And again, the batter doesn't have any seasoning at all. The only seasoning that it has is just the seasoning packet from some ramen, which is seriously too salty and doesn't has much flavour. Don't order this.... Ever!!!
The cheese ribs are alright, but the not spicy ones are really sweet, and the medium spicy ones are really spicy, there's just not a right flavour for me so I don't like to order it. If you are here with one or two friends, I would actually recommend you to try this. But do choose a right spicy level tho. 
The ramens are just terrible. If you don't know, it is just shin ramen with some extra stuff, pork, onions, etc... So it definitely doesn't worth 10+ dollars. I think that it tasted ok, but then again, how can you make packaged ramen taste horrible?
In general, it is a nice place if you have never had Korean ramen before and want to try something new. But if you really want some decent ramen, walk a few minutes to kinton, which is much better. Or sansotei on Dundas, which in my opinion, is the best ramen place in town."}
{"text":"I always pass by this place whenever I walk by Baldwin Village. One Friday evening I was originally gonna try Platito Filipino Soul Food, but it was closed for some strange reason so I decided to try Mo' Ramyun. Me and my friend ordered the spicy cheese chicken plate. It was really good, but a small portion for what you pay for. Plus, the add-ons are quite pricey. Otherwise, When glancing over other tables that ordered off the regular menu, I saw tasty food with great portions. 

Overall, was not impressed by the portions. If i ever come back, I will definitely try one of their other food."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon. It was dead. Probably because it was at 130pm but still. The place has a funny smell to it, like an old house. I was almost positive that it smelled like mold. I sat down and the server was quick  to get my order. I ordered the corn cheese ramyun since there was an article about it saying it's similar to carbonara. I didn't really like it. It wasn't savoury or anything, it was just plain creamy. I might come back to try the other food on the menu since I like giving other places a second chance. So with that being said.... This is to be continued.."}
{"text":"The cheese ribs at this place are the most delicious ribs I've ever had. So tender and flavorful, they fall right off the bone! A good portion of cheese is included in the dish, but be careful and stir it around often, or it'll burn.

I've also had the mo ramyun, and the portion is huge! Lots of toppings and the noodles themselves could easily be two portions. Very yummy. The spring rolls and spicy fried rice cakes are excellent appetizers and are both very tasty.

Will definitely be returning for the cheese ribs - my friend and I could not get enough of them!"}
{"text":"Cheesy meat!! If you love cheese and spicy food, you should definitely check this place out. 
 
Visited this place during the summer and sat on their outside patio. 

The offer a variety of Korean food. But most unique thing they have here is their cheesy chicken and pork. Not a lot of places serve this dish. 

Ordered spicy pork rubs and spicy chicken topped with cheesy goodness. We ordered mild because my spicy tolerance is low.  They serve the dish in a pot on top of a portable stove in order to melt the cheese on top. The ribs were so soft. They fell right off the bones. The flavour was not too salty. The cheese was stringy and chewy. They give you gloves so that you can dig in with out getting your hands dirty. 

A little pricy as it was 29.95 for two people for that dish. There was not that much and It was not so filling. You would need to ordered another dish. 

Overall good place if you want something spicy and cheesy."}
{"text":"Came here just for the cheese ribs amd it did not disappoint!! They also provide gloves for you to eat with. Ordered beer which goes perfectly with it. Just a small little place. My server didnt speak english that well but we managed lol"}
{"text":"Great find in the area, it was really friendly service, spacious as most restaurants in area are a tight squeeze, accommodating to little ones(also rare), food was fresh and quick. Earlier this year it was under another name McRamen I believe. 

My server was nice enough to even provide baby cutlery for my 11month old and attentive even though they were close to full that night. 

Food was good but mediocre for ramen. There are better ramen downtown with richer soup bases, but I was happy enough with this place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Overall, the environment was good and the food was okay. Me and my friend ordered a half half, half chicken wings and half pork ribs. We ordered spicy, after eating half of it, we found it heavy and a bit of spicy. In my opinion, it is better to hang out with three to four friends and order this for two people, cause the cheese with meat is really heavy. If you post something on Instagram and tag the restaurant, you will also get 2-3% off...I'm not sure but it is under 10%..."}
{"text":"I was initially was going to give a one star but I added another one since the service was good. Came here while it was raining and tried their cheese-rib dish that was becoming the new food trend. It was very expensive as each dish had a minimum of two orders (which is standard in a lot of places). My friend and I got both got an order of half ribs and chicken wings, being 18.99 each order. For what they gave, I was very disappointed as they only have around 3 small pieces of the ribs and 6 chicken wings with a moderate amount of cheese in the middle. I did not expect this little for nearly $40.

My friend and I were excited to try the bulgogi fries because we both love bulgogi but this one had a weird taste. There was kimchi on it and it was more overpowering than the bulgogi and the bulgogi did not taste like it was even marinated. Overall, it was one of the places that I did want to try but I do not think I would come back."}
{"text":"This place is a solid albeit a little pricey meal. We got rice cakes, pork dumplings and a kitchen poutine as an appetizer. Overall, the rice cakes was the best but the pork dumplings were nothing special. The Kim hi poutine is amazing but it's a main course that was shared between three people. I would recommend it as a main course. We also got three half and half a with ribs and man, are they good. Defining would go back for this as the ribs and wings braised in a Korean fusion marinade with a kick, regular was hot for us so I wouldn't venture past that but feel free to do so, melts slowly into the cheese making a delicious mess that melts in your mouth. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Mo' Ramyun is located right at the corner just as you turn into Baldwin Village. The store front grabs your attention and also the menu has some unique items that are worth a try eg. kimchi ramyun poutine, ramyun fried chicken and spicy cheese simmered with ribs and wings on a pan. They are probably the only restaurant I've seen that offers ribs and wings in a cheesy Korean dish. My friend who ordered spicy cheese noted that the ribs were dry. The cheese was very good and looked plentiful but not much noodle was offered when you add $2. Also if you ask for mild for that dish, it still turns out spicy. But I guess you can't escape the spice when the dish is called \"spicy cheese\".  

This place still offers the Korean/Japanese classics like japchae, bibimbap, kalbi, tonkatsu. My friends ordered the kalbi and tonkatsu, wings and poutine and had no complaints. 

My Order - Mo' Ramyun with medium spice
The portion size was massive! It felt like there were 2 packs of instant noodles in there. The dish was pretty ho-hum even though there was a variety of ingredients. It just wasn't memorable. The egg was perfectly cooked and all I can remember was the wood ear (black fungus) and some bok choy. There were only two tiny pieces of pork belly swimming in the huge bowl of noodles. I ordered medium and it was VERY spicy. The broth had very little depth and the spiciness just overtook it. It almost tasted like they used the spicy powder you may find in the instant noodle pack. Overall not bad, I usually love instant noodles but I didn't enjoy eating it. It doesn't require much technique to achieve this result. I can probably make something just as good at home (I love to deck out my instant noodles). 

So in short, I'll suggest to skip the soup ramyun and make it at home. Try their ramyun hacked bar food items and spicy cheese dish if you want to try it with wings and ribs."}
{"text":"I walk by this place all the time and decided to try it. I was disappointed with both the portion size and the food. I originally only wanted to try their cold noodles but when the noodles came I knew it wasn't enough food so I also ordered the takoyaki. The noodles though were presented well were undercooked in a mediocre soup with half an egg and 2 pieces of crabmeat. The takoyaki didn't really have octopus. The food is was definitely not worth what I paid. The only good part was the service."}
{"text":"One of my favourite ramen places! The soup has great flavours and I like that you can adjust the spice level. My favourite is the Soon Tofu Ramyun! The only thing stopping me from giving a 5 is the service. I find the staff to be sometimes inattentive."}
{"text":"Even though not the best place I ever visited, it definitely worth more than 3 stars (esp. considering that other restaurants on the same street that I consider similar quality are getting 4-4.5, not fair). Ordered the ramen wings and kimchi poutine, both Taste good and are unique that you can't get else where. Wings are crispy outside but yet juicy inside. Poutine has got mozza cheese that's blowtorched slightly that gives one extra layer of charcoal flavor, the cheese, kimchi, bolgogi and extra crispy fries came together surprisingly well ( ramen is kinda er.. in between the layers, but I don't mind to have some that gives more texture to the food). Also ordered ramen bowl which is okay but not bad. Service was typical for East Asian restaurants that the server is friendly in responding but didn't attempt to chat. Liked the interior decorations and the solid wood high tables (very large and comfortable)."}
