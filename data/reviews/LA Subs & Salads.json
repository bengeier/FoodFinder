{"text":"The prices are about average for Las Vegas but would be considered expensive elsewhere. My wrap tasted burnt. A friend ordered a salad but his vegetables were wilted. Even Subway has better sandwiches for less than half the price."}
{"text":"Had the turkey and ham sub, was good and tasted very fresh.  It's a nice option for a fresh made sandwhich.  Will be back to try their wrap."}
{"text":"I feel disheartened to give \" LA Subs \" a mediocre review due to the 5 Stars they have gotten below. Myself and my friend decided to try their food out last night. I ordered the chicken mozzarella with pesto sauce no tomatoes panini. My friend ordered a bacon Sandwich with no cheese. Both meals made both of our stomachs feel not the best afterwards and now this morning I'm still feeling ill. I didn't eat the other half of my sandwich either. The taste was meh. Nothing I couldn't do better and if I can top it then that's scary. Hoping we just had a bad experience and if we try it again it'll be more satisfying with zero tummy ache."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a sandwich. First time there, and the young man at the counter was very helpful. His name is Nico. My sandwich was big enough for 2 people and was tasty. Will try a different one next trip."}
{"text":"Healthy alternative to the regular fast food offered at your normal food court. Located within the Luxor Hotel and Casino...right by Starbucks and across from McDonald's.   Friendly and quick staff. Lovely service! The menu selections include freshly made sub sandwiches, wraps, grilled paninis, and fresh fresh tasty salads. With each order, you can decide if you want a side of fries or small salad for an additional cost. Also offered is the premium deli meats and cheeses sliced right in-front of you!  Wish this establishment exists in Hawaii as their food tastes amazing."}
{"text":"I've eaten here the last two times in Vegas.  It's conveniently located in the Flamingo food court.   Pretty much the only healthy option to the pizza, asian and Johnny Rockets also in there.  I like the California club panini with a side of fries as they also sell Nathan's hot dogs at this location. The crinkle cut fries are golden, crispy and not greasy. Overall for Vegas food court food, this is good food.  The chicken on the panini is grilled, it's not lunch meat and the veggies are fresh.  Depending on the time of day the service varies, mood wise and speed.  This time the service was slow and not very friendly but still the same quality of food.   Very satisfying. They are a bit pricy $10 for the sandwich add $3 for the fries. But for Vegas that's pretty average. I Recommend and would go back."}
{"text":"had the California chicken avocado wrap, and wow, was freakin awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly needed a quick bite after a long day at the Las Vegas Convention Center setting up for a show.  Went with the turkey and bacon sub.  Was surprised at how much meat and cheese was included.  Honestly a good, filling sub that kept me happy through to dinner time.    If you want a quick bite in the Flamingo, this is definitely a good choice."}
{"text":"Terrible Service. Slow and apathetic! Sandwiches were mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Great sandwich SLOW service... For having three people back there last night I cannot believe how long I had to wait once my sandwich was made! Great subs!"}
{"text":"Over two trips to Las Vegas I've eat three meals at LA Subs & Salads. Its not a gourmet place, but it also is quick and relatively inexpensive ($12-15 for a sub and fries). The meat is freshly sliced and tastes very fresh. If you are staying in the Flamingo, as I was on my most recent trip, its a very convenient place to eat any time of day, as it is right on the casino floor."}
{"text":"Very good turkey wrap and fries. Not huge but filling. Staff was friendly, helpful and accommodating.  Just couldn't give it a 5 star.. you gotta try this spot at least once..  I paid $14 for the wrap and fries. (Meal for 1 person).."}
{"text":"Foods great, overpriced for what it is but it's Vegas. Ladies working there were very rude, also to the poor woman in front of me. Kept making comments in Spanish and laughing at people. Not professional, will not return to this location"}
{"text":"Nancy S Decided to have a hot dog before going to bed. It smelled good and tasted good but by morning I was throwing up and my granddaughter's stomach was upset.  We spent most of the morning in bed then got up and all I could eat was a little fruit until later in evening when I finally started feeling better. I will not be eating there again apparently the do not handle their food safely. It was just a plain Nathan's dog with pkg ketchup nothing else so it had to be the meat. Have been going to Vegas for years and have never had a problem like this."}
{"text":"Was looking for some late night food while at the Flamingo after a few beers. I saw that they were open and had no line so gave it a try. I was really glad that I did. I ordered the roast beef sub and could not have had a better sub. The guy behind the counter really knew his stuff. He sliced the roast beef for the sub fresh in front of me. He piled it high and asked what toppings I wanted.  They have pretty much all you could want. Once it was made he wrapped it tight and bagged it for me as I was not eating in. The girl who was running the register was not overly friendly but it was right at closing. Maybe she was tired.  The food court could use some cleaning but the food was great.   I really do not understand the bad reviews. If you want high end food, why are you eating in the food court?  It is on the pricey side but you are paying for convenience on the strip.  So if you are hungry, give it a try. If you want really cheap food fast. The golden arches are just down the street."}
{"text":"Located inside the food court at Flamingo. The subs are expensive compared to other options in he food court, however the quality wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.   My friend from LA said that he never heard of LA Subs & Salads despite its name; which is quite ironic!"}
{"text":"We ate at LA Subs for lunch. The food here is always great  and is made to order. Always a pleasant atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"Back in Vegas and staying at the Luxor and we stopped here to get a sandwich. The food is fresh and made to your order. The staff is friendly and prices are about average for lad Vegas. Food is always fresh."}
{"text":"All other fast-food sandwich chains can't even compare. Fresh premium meat & cheese sliced to order and a great menu selection. I always come when I'm at Flamingo! Order the sloppy joe!!! Turkey, rare Roast Beef, Swiss Cheese, Cole Slaw, and Thousand Island dressing! Party in your mouth!  I live in L.A, and unfortunately there's no L.A location so it's my treat in Vegas."}
{"text":"Plain Hot Dogs are $4.95. Our order of 1 dog plain and 1 chili with large drink was $16.05. Hot dogs were small, not the large ones at costco.... Way too expensive for plain ass dog. But this Vegas... Do yourself a favor and spend your money at Johnny Rockets next door.  Why do u think they have such a bad review!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken and mozzarella Panini was delicious.  The price was about 3 times as much as I would have expected but none the less it was a good sandwich.  Not 100% sure I have convinced myself the money was worth it."}
{"text":"Had this place earlier today for lunch. I'm a local and I was down at the Flamingo Hotel for a Massage conference and we had a lunch break so I decided to try this Sub place. Never had it before and I was craving a sandwich so why not.   I was greeted quickly and my order was taken fast. I had the ham & cheese sandwich on wheat bread with a Dr. Pepper. It was delicious. The bread was soft and the ham was tasty. The only downfall was one size only for drinks and I didn't need a huge soda but that's all they offered.   I recommend trying their subs. It's pricey but that's expected when it's on the strip."}
{"text":"$11 for the Asian Salad with Chicken. Seems a bit much but it's the only heathy fast food in the area, and the price is actually decent given the other options.   But the salad was actually really good - the chicken was freshly cooked while I waited, and the salad was fresh. Dressing a bit heavy, but take it on the side and you're fine."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Luxor and stopped here while at the pool one day. Got the club wrap and it was really good. I found it odd it was toasted, but it was fine and didn't make it too greasy or heavy; it actually added a nice crispy texture to the outside. Definitely a good healthier option than pizza, McDonald's, etc. in the food court."}
{"text":"The subs and salads at LA Subs and Salads were alright. They are a little pricey for what you get but there's a Subway right next door for a lower price, however, Subway doesn't sell chicken and paninis! I wish it was a little more affordable for the value that you get."}
{"text":"Fast, won't break the bank, super fresh ingredients, and delicious bread! If you're in a rush to get to a show, def scoop one up and eat on the way!"}
{"text":"In my eyes, this LA Subs is a glorified Nathan's that also sells subs (this location is listed on Nathan's website). When I am spending time on the Strip and am buffeted out or want to eat light, Nathan's is good fast food that satisfies my hunger. Of course being on the Las Vegas Strip, it is pricey fast food.    Going back to the early 80s, and maybe even the late 70s from a little child to a middle-aged adult I have been a fan of Nathan's crinkley cut fries. Now that I live in Las Vegas, the only opportunity to enjoy these delicious crinkley cut fries is when I'm on the Las Vegas Strip. On a mellow day of the recent staycation  hanging out in the Wildlife Habitat, we decided to have Nathan's from the Flamingo food court LA Subs.    Where the quality of Nathan's crinkley cut fries have been consistently good the last 35 years, good management has been inconsistent. On this staycation, just the day before we had a lousy experience with the Bally's Nathan's. The experience at this glorified Nathan's was the opposite. As soon as we ordered the food, one lady was starting to make the food while the other processed the order. An expensive order by the way. A Pepsi, crinkley cut fries, and Chile cheese hot dog came to over $17.    The Flamingo food court featured sufficient seating. There were zero issues with cleanliness. The soundtrack was the oldies hits that poured out from Johnny Rocket's creating the feel that I was dining in the Coney Island Nathan's back in the 60s.     This glorified Nathan's is good. It would be a 3.5 star good if they offered the super cheeseburger. In conclusion, I might return here if I'm by the center Strip to snack on crinkley cut fries with a Pepsi to hold me over til dinner."}
{"text":"EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!! Ok what the crap??? I am sorry but I wasted $14 bucks eating here! I had some time before my flight and I was staying at the Flamingo. So I checked my bags and ventured off for something to eat. I unwisely chose this place. I ordered the tomato and mozzarella wrap. That was the most disgusting thing ever. I took two bites before I threw it in the trash.  How was it disgusting you ask??? Well, where the hell do I begin?   The \"mozzarella\" - lets start there. I have mozzarella in quotes because that cheese was either rotten or it was NOT mozzarella. It was not even the right damn color.  Mozzarella is favorite cheese and it does not taste like a dirty dish towel like this cheese they put in there. This cheese had a sharp rotten taste to it and was rigid. Whatever it was it was far from fresh.   The tomatoes were devoid of any flavor. I don't know how else to describe them but blah.   The wrap as a whole had no flavor expect for the rotten cheese flavor. Their pathetic attempt to spice it up with some kind of oil based dressing was unsuccessful. That too was devoid of any flavor so I had to dump salt on it just to take the two bites I did.   Now now, before anyone freaks out at me please understand that I did not walk up to LA Subs & Salads expecting a culinary masterpiece or anything but I did expect at least something halfway decent that I could take more than two bites of. This place had alot of nerve charging what they charge for crap. The only thing that was tolerable was the soda which came from a fountain. As anyone can guess there is no way on this planet or any other that I will come back here. I recommend that you stay away."}
{"text":"I am writing this review for NATHANS only! I have not tried anything else from the L.A. Subs but I could not find a Review place for this Nathans location on Yelp.  I have eaten here for Nathans the last few times I've come to Vegas, the last time being a few days ago! I absolutely love Nathans chili cheese dogs, they never disappoint!  The Flamingo food court is always clean and I've never had a problem with any of the other customers, drunks or not! Wish I had eaten more as im back home now, cant wait to come back and get my chili cheese dog fix!"}
{"text":"Was wandering around the nooks and crannies of Luxor and hadn't been by the utility Food Court in awhile (the McD actually closed! Replaced by a chicken strip specialty place - not a Chick-fil-a, a local copy.)   Saw this one expecting another Subway franchise, but behold, it's a decent hoagie/grinder/sub/salad alternative. Strictly speaking, the closest thing to LA would probably be its proximity to the city, as you won't find micro-greens or beet hummus on this menu.   But I did find fresh French puffy and crunchy rolls (white and wheat), sliced to order meats, and they can panini grill anything (even if it's not a panini) Skin-on fries are also made to order.   Looks like MB mgt. addressed any service issues mentioned a few years ago, as this is one city where the competition is so fierce, they have no reason to keep problematic vendors in place. Service was courteous and thoughtful, and would be a great catering choice for a sports party, or any grab and go occasion.  Up on the 2nd floor floating level tucked behind the museum exhibition, LASubs works for a daytime alternative to the otherwise pretty heavy fare found in all the other nearby venues, including the Shoppes at the MB.  During the week, you may find lots of school age kids here at the food court, as the museum is a popular field trip destination. But that's life growing up in Las Vegas - going to casinos for Sunday brunches, or to view worldly exhibitions is a unique part of being a kid here (technically in Paradise, NV - you learn that in State history class here.)"}
{"text":"Pretty much the only place to get a healthier bite to eat later in the evening in this food court at the Flamingo that also features a pizza joint, a fake food Chinese place, and Johnny Rockets.  Prices are what you would expect at a casino. $10 for a grilled chicken California wrap that had more lettuce and avocado in it than actual chicken. Skip the fries and get a side salad for $3 to at least make you think you're eating healthy. Co-located with Nathans which is kind of odd. Girls who work there are nice but kind of confused when it comes to charging it to your room. Plus, they almost overcharged me too. Not the swiftest crew here. Left this meal feeling totally underwhelmed.  Crap, I should have just went to Johnny Rockets for a burger and fries."}
{"text":"Idiot alert! We decided to stop after a show on the way back up to our room, and the stupid girl working the register wouldn't take my card after asking to see my ID; she said \"the card says Bill, but your ID says William; do you have another photo ID which says Bill?\"  After a moment of trying to explain, and another employee getting involved and confirming what the first girl said, we gave up and walked away.  We had far better hot dogs the next night from the Haute Doggery, so don't even bother with this place!"}
{"text":"I don't get the negative reviews for this place...I ate here on Saturday, and I enjoyed my meal.  Sure, it was $10 for a single chicken Cesar wrap, but you ARE on The Strip, and everything else in the food court was the same price...starting at $9 and going up.  The wait for the wrap was a little long, but they were grilling the chicken right there, so it was fresh and hot.  I thought it was tasty.    Service was friendly too.  I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of the value here. Small restaurant that sells subs and salads for a premium price. Food was just okay, but there was no line so the food was delivered very quickly!  I ordered their beer specials, where they serve a single bottle for $7.50 and a bucket of 5 bottles for $30. The bucket isn't a bad value, especially being out on the strip. The food just didn't cut it for me.  Great staff, they were helpful but it is just not worth it for me!"}
{"text":"Good food, I had the Californian wrap. The service was good. Cut was a little pricy but convenient."}
{"text":"One of the brighter points of my stay at the luxor. Excellent food everything cut and made in front of you."}
{"text":"Good news is that they have Nathan's hotdogs.  Unfortunately the service is terrible for counter service.  Had to wait 10 minutes to order while two people helped  the person in front of that ordered one sandwich. No manager to help with deficiencies."}
{"text":"This place is honestly gross. We were just hungry walking by, and an Italian Sub seemed like a safe order... Literally worst one I've ever had. You can tell the meat quality is cheap, and the bread had no flavor. People working here were nice, but the eating area seemed dirty, even saw a random fruit fly on the table. To be fair, I suppose that could have came from one of the other restaurants nearby. Don't go here, trust me. I live in L.A., and I've never seen one of these place back home! LOL"}
{"text":"This place is horrible! The bread was old and they didnt even have pickles!  The sandwich was put together very poorly and was not cut properly. They still messed up our order even after we corrected them. We will never be coming back again."}
