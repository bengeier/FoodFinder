{"text":"Update from review given 8/9/16.  Babalu's customer service manager reached out to our group and it is evident they are indeed taking heart to hear the issues with customer service and food.  I went back for dinner on 8/27/16 with a group of 6 people.  I personally ordered the tuna and salmon small plates.  They were both very good.  One person ordered the chorizo and shrimp and stated it was very good.  4 people ordered the tacos and that was hit or miss.  3 of the people said they liked the tacos and one person said the tacos lacked flavor and did not finish his last one.  I jokingly told him that I had hinted to order the American fare and he took his chances anyway  :-)   The pinnacle was the bread pudding.  OMG ... the trip is worth the bread pudding alone... which I wish I would have gotten, my friend only gave me a sample.  It was AMAZING, warm, and delicious served with whipped cream and strawberries.  I personally got the Mexican Chocolate fudge which was a mistake.  I was expecting a Mexican chocolate flavor with spicy heat and cinnamon, and instead I got the taste of bittersweet dark chocolate and salt.  No, no, no.  Another friend got the pineapple empanadas served with a scoop of ice cream and it was very, very good.  It reminded me of a fruit turnover rather than a Mexican fruit empanada (due to the flavor inside).  Again, if you stick to the Southern fare you should be good.  Our server Jordyn was very pleasant and took good care of us.  The only little slip was I asked the manager for a to go box when he asked about our experience and he never came back and hence I never received one, so I just put my dessert in some napkins and took it with me.  Otherwise, the service organization was much better this time around, we all got the order we submitted correctly."}
{"text":"Terrible, bland tacos.  Limited beer selection on tap, long waits and extremely loud. Will not return."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place to meet up with some friends for dinner. We were really early, so sat at the bar and looked over a menu and the bartender asked us what we wanted to drink. We ended up walking outta that place with neither food nor drinks. The cheapest beer they had was a domestic Yeungling for $8.50? Didn't feel like going broke after having a round of drinks before we even got to the food!"}
{"text":"NOT a dog friendly establishment, despite what staff may say. Went there for dinner when it was a little chilly out (didn't want to disturb others) and wanted to bring the dog. Called ahead to make sure that bringing a dog would be OK if we sat outside. Staff confirmed it would be fine.  We show up, and there's confusion about whether it is OK or not to have the dog. After the manager/owner confirmed it was OK, we went around to the patio area. The staff had barricaded the side entrance with chairs, so they had to remove the chairs so we could actually get in the patio area with the dog. While we were waiting at the door, the hostess moving the chairs and a bus boy were complaining about the work and asking \"who the f*ck wants to sit out here?\". We could clearly hear them, and they knew we were standing right there.  After their complaining, making us feel extremely unwelcome, we finally sat down. The waitresses were nice, but what kind of people say that when a paying customer is right in front of you???  The food was OK after that point and were just ready to go after that. Stick with the side dishes, tacos were subpar.  If you go, go for a date night but DO NOT bring a pet despite what any of the staff say.Also much better Mexican food (taste and price) around if that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Love the decor, it's happy and clean and friendly.  The service was ok. Slow then quick then slow- so inconsistent.  The chips are good - thick and homemade - but overly salted.  The guacamole is standard but has options for adding special things like bacon.  Tacos were bleh.  Homemade corn tortillas taste like the GF saucers that they are.  Steak taco had heat but no flavor.  Chicken taco I literally spit out because the whole thing just tasted like burned/smoked nothing.  Sorry to say, I won't return unless it's just for drinks and the awesome patio."}
{"text":"After an afternoon out with our baby, we decided to go to dinner here. When we walked in we loved the openness of the place and the food smelled great. So. We were excited.   They write your name and the time you are seated on a card on your table. This is why I know we waited exactly 17 minutes before anyone came to our table to ask us if we would like a drink. After the table that was sat nearly 10 minutes after us placed their order. Not off to a great start.   Our waitress immediately apologized and offered a free app. Which to me doesn't really make up for the wait. But yes, we did get the guacamole for free. We placed our drink, app and food order right then. Since we had been sitting there for so long we were prepared.   We were brought water.   Later, they brought my husband's food.   After that they brought our beers (the only good thing about the whole experience).   Then they brought our appetizer. My husband was almost done with his dinner by this point. Which let me give you some detail about that. He ordered the pork belly Tacos. Zero flavor. And it was BBQ. Not pork belly.   I ordered the good morning Vietnam beer. It was a wooden robot, coffee vanilla blonde ale. I highly recommend this beer. Just get it from somewhere else.   They make their guac fresh at the table. The table next to us ordered it as well. Their waitress told them all about what she was doing as she was doing it. Our waitress whispered what the ingredients were and then made it in complete silence. Do not get the sundried tomatoes in it. It ruins it. The texture is off. Their chips are rock hard and literally have no taste.   Finally! My food came. I ordered the tuna. It was mostly avocado with a few random pieces of tuna on top of crackers that were way over seasoned. I couldn't taste the tuna or avocado over the seasoning on the crackers.   Never once did our waitress ask us if my daughter needed anything. (She didn't, but courtesy would suggest asking...)  We sat for much too long after all the food was gone before we were brought a check.   Please let me mention that it was 4:45-5:00 and not at all busy. And people around us were served much faster.   Their food is awful and the service diluent really have been worse unless they actually spit directly on me.   Also, I'm pretty sure when I was in the restroom over of their waitresses left without washing her hands. I'm not 100% sure. So. Don't quote me on that. I'm only 90% sure."}
{"text":"Long wait. Mediocre food.  Was expecting a lot better. Drinks were too sweet.? Waited over an hour for a couple of tacos. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Babalu is a new restaurant in Dillworth that focus on tapas and tacos.  The modern decor and open atmosphere enhanced the dining experience.  The menu offered freshly made small plates that can easily satisfy the meat eater and vegan alike.  My tacos were delicious!  You have option of fried, grilled or pan seared.  The tortillas and chips are house made.  The fresh table prepared guacamole was as tasty as the previous restaurant located in this location (a very good thing).  Service was great and the wait staff was very friendly.   Attached photo - fried oysters, grilled red snapper and grilled shrimp tacos.   I will gladly return to taste other menu options."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect and was very pleasantly surprised.  The Parking is a little bit of an issue, but that's to be expected in Dilworth. If a restaurant has easy parking in this area, it probably isn't worth the trip.  The ambiance was great and hostesses were especially nice and helpful.  It was good to see more than just one person taking names and filling us in on the menu during our wait. Their Smiles were a Great first impression. Our wait time was about 30 minutes and  an expanded bar area to have a drink would be a good upgrade as it can get hot outside. The food is very good and gives some of the other upscale taco places a run for their money.  We particularly liked the ,oyster taco, blackened redfish taco, skillet and  roasted corn.  The service was good as well. My one criticism would be that it seemed servers only cared about their section. Our server worked her tail off while it a lot of the staff just stood around. Could be that folks were training, but it was noticeable.  Some kinks, but looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"If you think this place is going to be a cool new spot and somewhere to try, don't even bother. The inside has the strangest vibe to it... I don't know if it's the color scheme or what but it just seems like I'm in a kindergarten classroom or something...   Other than that, let's talk about food. Not impressive whatsoever. Just go to Bakersfield... Trust me. The queso is $7.50... Not too expensive but they literally give you enough for about one person. We tried tacos after that and they were just not comparable to other places. Barely any meat in there and they overload them with veggies... I took a bite of the carnitas one and it literally tastes like peanut butter because of the \"peanut slaw\" they use. Not something you want out of a taco...   Overall the service was good. Not a horrible experience but I won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better definitely is the way we all felt after eating at Babalu today.  The service is great, and they are very welcoming and attentive here.....so good job on that.  However, the food is just not cutting it. It's funny after reading a lot of reviews people are raving about this place, but I really think those people are experiencing what Charlotte has to offer, and that consists of a lot of chain restaurants.  We had the tableside guac, which was OK.  We like heat in our guac so we ordered it with jalapeno....for $1.00 extra it comes diced on the side.  Now if it were minced it would mix in the guac more and you would have an even heat, however you just end up biting a huge piece of jalapeno. The two others at the table got the butternut squash which was actually very good.  I got two tacos: one chicken and one fried shrimp.  The breading came off of the shrimp revealing it had not been deveined, which is disgusting.  I discovered that on my last bite, had I known beforehand that would have went back.  That is just gross....no one wants to eat shrimp with black crap (literally) in it.  My friend got the duck taco, and bit down on a nice sized bone, which is also gross.  Unfortunately, we won't be visiting again.  Too bad because the place itself is pretty inviting and cute."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! Excellent service and great food. Always fresh and hot! Nice place to gather with friends for a girls nite or lunch. Such a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place will be closed in 6 months max. You'd never know it was Cuban w a name that is cajun. Florescent lighting like I'm in Walmart at night w zero ambience, you have to pay for chips and pico which sucked and they don't have salsa unlike any Mexican restaurant in the world, guacamole was bland even after adding jalapenos which are extra, food in general was average at best, broccoli was so tough I think it was microwaved rubber, bar tender was nice but hardly knew the menu never mind how to sell it and not a single cab or Merlot on the wine list. But....the beer selection was both solid and tasty.   Sorry you spent $2 million dollars on your renovation. Go to Lebowski's across the street or anywhere for that matter."}
{"text":"Service was great!  Food was ok.  Ordered tacos (eh), crab cakes (ok), salad (drenched in dressing), steak on a stick (pretty good).  The server was super nice, though."}
{"text":"Really tasty queso. Not like how you'd expect at other Mexican restaurants. It's not that liquidy dip, it's straight melted cheese but it's delicious and I wanted two orders of it. Menu says it comes with a shooter of pico de Gallo, but it came in a shallow ramekin. Which is not a shooter but a much smaller portion. It was about a tablespoon. Would be cool if it came in a tall shot glass. (The pico was on the money taste wise)   Mojito Margarita tastes like a regular margarita and was nothing unique. Pineapple margarita was great.   The tacos weren't terrible but they were below average and $3.50 a piece. The tortilla was cold and fell apart easily. It seems wrong...The tuna taco is flavorless. The tuna needs to sit in some soy and Sambal Olek or they need to amp up the aioli for some zing. It was unseasoned and not marinated cubes of tuna. Salt is your friend. Tasting is your friend. We tried about 5 different tacos across the board and weren't impressed with a single one. If you want good tacos in town head to Tacos El Nevado. $1.75 for the best tacos al pastor and cebollitas.    Babalu has ambiance + drinks in a growing part of town which will make it popular. The tapas here are probably the way to go vs tacos. We all left feeling Ok about the place. Wasn't a huge disappointment or fantastic. I wouldn't not recommend this place...it is worth stopping by for a drink and some small plates for sure.   Also, the reviewer who took a photo of those girls and insulted them for the greet below took things a little too far and that's just plain not cool. Please be respectful of the people who are serving you. Don't forget to tip your waiters AND valets because they work for tips. :)"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Guac and queso are delicious. Can't go wrong with anything but my favorites are the burger, the redfish, and the babarita!"}
{"text":"Friday night and there was still room at the bar - Yay!  Amber was awesome - very attentive, knowledgeable, and fun!  The food was fantastic.  The shrimp and chorizo skillet on a bed of rice was seasoned perfectly and filling.  I don't care much for red meat, but we got the filet on a stick.  It was so tender I didn't even care it was steak!  There was this delicious cheese on the little potato hash and I couldn't place what it was - Chihuahua lol (I guess that's only funny if you're envisioning the Meet the Parents \"milking\" moment... ok nvmd) We also got the tuna ceviche - so fresh and colorful.  I would've liked a but less tomato and onion so the tuna could stand out as a flavor a bit more, but it was wonderfully executed.  The prices seem fair for what you're getting - keep in mind you're getting small plates, not a full entree! I was not wowed by the cocktails (thus the 4 stars, but really more like a 4.5 if Yelp would let me do 1/2 stars) but they do have a good beer list.   Parking was valet only, until the lot is full.  We got there early enough that we had no issues with parking and just before some annoying hovering-over-the-shoulder-yuppie-bar-fly couple starting coughing in my hair and disregarding the sacred personal space (they had nothing to do with the lower star rating - some people are just obnoxious).  It was also getting louder and fuller, so it was the perfect time to make an exit.  I'll definitely be back, keeping in mind the timing so it's not too loud or crowded :)"}
{"text":"We went to Babalu for he 1st time last Friday night to celebrate my wife's birthday. Even though we had a party of 8 and it was during Charlotte's Restaurant Week, the service was incredible and the fare even better! Our server, Jordan, was exceptional and the Manager even comp'd our desserts because he felt we waiting too long for them. Amazing selection of food and the desserts are worth a try for sure. Put this on your must visit list."}
{"text":"New place, new heaven!  We were to the pre-opening. However the place was full, the service was very fast and friendly even Rebecca the manager came to our table to see if everything was ok. Our waitress Laura explain to us everything on the menu.   Drinks were really good especially the Baba-Rita (fresh and fruity) and my favorite Baba Bee's Knees (sour and limy).   The guacamole was good, but the queso blanco dip was outstanding. We share different tapas and all of them were really good, but tacos de pollo with blue tortilla (wow real Mexican touch), torta cubana, and braised beef short beef were delicious!   As a dessert, the spicy Mexican fudge and  the cinnamon bread pudding were really good.  This is a new heaven place who loves Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Food was ok but not as good as Bakersfield. Our server was nice but the quality of service was very poor. We had to re-do the check 3 times to get it right. We had to wait 10 minutes after I ordered my a beer only to be told they were out. Another ten minutes before the next beer I chose came out. We had the same wait on our dessert too.  I would not recommend going here until a few more months have passed so they work out all the kinks. It was busy, but i think that had a lot to do with the slow service keeping people longer than they should be."}
{"text":"Loved this place, food was awesome, cool atmosphere. Celeste, our bartender, was super warm and welcoming and took great care of us. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love the energy and beachy interior at Babalu.  It's a fun place.  The service is super eager but can be a little disorganized.  The drink menu is excellent.  I loved the pineapple margarita.  Who knew that would be such a perfect combination.    Now to the food.  A little hit or miss here.  The pico de gallo and chip was disappointing.  The pico was completely flavorless.  The chips were more like pita chips instead of tortilla chips.  Not a fan.  Who knew you could mess up chips and salsa?  I had a trio of tacos...redfish, duck and fried oysters.  Sounds good, but so-so.  The redfish taco was the best.  The duck taco had good flavor but was very dry.  The oyster taco was unpleasant....too much heat and too little seasoning.  My friend said the black bean burger was so-so.  The sides were the best...grilled broccolini and sweet potato fries.     The food needs tweaking.  I would give Babalu another try because I liked the atmosphere.  Hopefully the kitchen can up their game."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check out the new kid on the block last night. As it was a Wednesday evening, we were thinking they would no be crowded. Man, we were so wrong. This is obviously the place to be! We were able to grab two seats at the bar, so no wait!  Parking- The parking here is awful. Just park on the streets. They do have a lot but the valet parking blocks it all up! We got stuck in it and hightailed ourselves out of their for a very nice street spot. Fortunately, my husband is the parallel parking master!  Drinks- My husband got a wicked weed and I got the Mojarita. The marg was pretty good. Though, I did hear the bartender telling someone about their blood orange marg feature....wish i would have gotten that memo cause that sounded amazing! My only small complaint is I thought the margs were a bit overpriced. All were about $9-10. Having one lower range house marg is such a nice option.   Food- As guac fiends, we went with the table side guac. The guy that made our guac was super nice. I liked that they threw roasted red peppers in there! Delish and nice portion! The chips were the highlight though! For our meal, we split the chicken satay and one Carnita taco. The chicken satay was a great size and the black beans and rice underneath were to die for! My husband and I will have to agree to disagree on the tortilla cause I loved it. Small shell but alot of meat inside  Overall I thought this place was pumping out some tasty food and good vibes."}
{"text":"My new fave taco spot in Charlotte and great margaritas! The redfish tacos are a must!"}
{"text":"Oh man. I had a chance to try Babalu again last night and was way, way happier with all of my choices. My pal and I started by splitting the tuna ceviche appetizer, which is a pretty hefty bowl and would make for a good meal for one if it's dinnertime and you're feeling noshy, but don't necessarily want to sit down to a giant plate of enchiladas or something. 3-4+ people can easily share this as a good sized starter. The tuna, avocado, and other ingredients were all really fresh, the chips are thick and crisp, and the remaining ceviche juices were so good my friend ended up dipping his lamb sliders in the bowl by the end of the meal (don't judge, yo).  For my main, I went with a pile of tacos, trying the pollo (chicken), carnitas (pork), blackened redfish, and grilled camarones (shrimp). The redfish and pollo were standout favorites, with the carnitas coming in for a close second. They were all amply stuffed, served on soft blue corn tortillas, which I loved because how really, often do you get to eat blue food?  The other people in the party all really liked their orders too, raving over the queso dip (with +chorizo) and enchilada of the day as particular favorites. Drinks were terrific, and served up strong. Our waiter was really nice and attentive all night, along with the other serving staff that assisted. Our party ended up staying way later than any other diners in the restaurant, closing down the place (oops), but none of the staff made us feel like they were impatient about our being there."}
{"text":"I had a pretty good experience when I trie Babalu. The food was pretty good and the atmosphere was great, especially on the outdoor patio where we sat. I would definitely go back here but I would have to put it below some other taco places in town."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to the Dilworth area of Charlotte and to Babalu Tapas & Tacos, a neighborhood restaurant serving upscale Latin-inspired cuisine. From the minute you walk into the dining room you immediately discover that each eating area is uniquely designed.  Dora here. I agree. The spacious interior had a little something to make everyone comfortable with various textures like a wood ceiling, open ducts, concrete communal bars, and private tables.  For my lunch, I chose two tacos: the Carne de Cerdo, smoked pork belly, a chipotle-citrus BBQ sauce, peanut slaw, cotija cheese; and the Camarones, grilled shrimp and cilantro slaw, both on blue tortillas. I added a side of grilled broccolini sprinkled with goat cheese.  The tacos were both great, but the pork belly was my favorite. The crunch of the slaw and the creamy favor of the cheese made this one tasty taco. But the superstar was the grilled broccolini, with its roasted smoky favor and crumbly cheese, this side was cooked to just the right crunch.  Dora here. Ernie can keep his broccolini. lol. The Chicken Satay was melt in your mouth delicious! Four mini skewers of teriyaki glazed chicken, yellow rice, black beans and salsa. With a light hint of citrus, this dish packed a little heat but no burn. Absolutely one of my new favorite meals. And, even though this is considered a small plate, this meal satisfied.From their early reviews we understood there might've been a bit of a service issue. Apparently, that's been corrected because service was attentive and the food came out quick. If you're worried about parking, they have a few spots up front, but their complimentary valet made parking a breeze.  We rate this restaurant 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"Complimentary valet makes parking on a busy Saturday night very convenient. Our server, Jordyn, was friendly and attentive.  She explained that Babalu uses fresh local ingredients in tapas that are meant to be shared with friends.  For dinner, I ordered one pork taco and one chicken taco. The meat was very flavorful, but I would have preferred a little more sauce on the tacos since they were a bit dry. Although small, I found the two tacos to be filling. We ordered a few desserts- everyone agreed the Bread Pudding was the BEST!  I would recommend Babalu for lunch or dinner on a slow night. The Saturday night crowd was loud and obnoxious.  20-something men were yelling like they were in a sports bar instead of a nice restaurant. It was difficult to have a conversation with the person sitting across from me due to the noise. I will definitely give it another shot on a less busy night. Great food, reasonable prices, and friendly service."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and they're drinks are too! Only downside is the parking, although they do offer free valet the wait is pretty long at times, I recommend self parking. The staff is great too. Try the broccoli, that was my favorite."}
{"text":"Really love the atmosphere here. Its a fun place to get tapas and drinks with friends. They have margarita specials throughout the week (but do not offer margarita pitchers). Sangria pitchers are really great! Tacos are eh. All the other food is really good. Guac is made table side so of course they charge an arm and a leg for it. The sun dried tomatoes make me feel like they're trying to customize it a little too much but it works. Queso has this weird BBQ drizzle over it that ruins it but still good.  Love the salmon. Love the grits. Love the potatoes. Love the crab cakes."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and really fresh, made to order food.  The margaritas are great, too.  Check out the bathrooms while you are there as well, to freshen up!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and was not impressed.  Service is so-so even though they seem like they are trying.  Our server stopped by our table maybe once after we flagged him down during the whole meal.  All of our water cups were empty by the time he came to pick up our finished plates.   As for the food, its very mediocre. We tried the guacamole which was very normal, the chicken, pork belly, and beef tacos were nothing special too. The beef short rib was $11 for 4oz of meat ( SO SMALL!) and our party thought it had no flavor and was very dry. The best thing we probably ate was the fried shrimp tacos which was A-ok.   Overall, not impressed by their service nor their food. We understand that they just opened so we may give it another try after a year or so but we are in no rush to return."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and thought it was time for a review!   Starters: Table side Guacamole is just \"ok\". I am not sure what is missing (zest of lime or salt?). We even added the bacon and jalapenos and it just didn't do it for me. I do like how fluffy and wipped it is though.   Drinks: I have had the seasonal watermelon margarita and sangria (white and rose). I think both drinks were delicious. Can't go wrong with the house margarita.   Sides:  I love love the garlic potatoes with teriyaki glaze and cheese. They so are addictinggggg! ( Ive ordered them every time). Also, street corn! It's totally drizzled and covered with an amazing combination of calories, just get it! I could eat the corn and potatoes and walk out a happy girl. Also, it doesn't specify on the menu but you can ask for a small or large size of sides.   Tacos: I have had numerous tacos (chicken, pork, steak and tuna). I had the chicken most recently and I really was not a fan. The chicken is smoked and it's cut into strips, not sure but it's just not for me. I thought they were all just \"ok\". I'm not sure what is missing for me, but I do like the homemade tortilla.   Tapas: Filet on the Stick is delicious! Fierce shrimp has a great kick!   Sandwiches: are huge! The Cubana is amazing! Baba burger!!! Yes and yes!   With all of that being said, I have ate a lot of food here! Wow! :)  From 4-6pm Monday-Thursday is $2 tacos. I love the patio too! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I get it - it's new, but they've got some improvements to make before I'll be back. The tableside guac was very bland, but the chips were excellent. I ordered 2 Snapper Tacos and 1 Atun Taco. I thought the Snapper Tacos were good...just very, very small. We even asked the waitress how big they were and were led astray on that. The Atun Taco was not my thing. It was unseasoned hunks of raw tuna, which I didn't think played well with the funky tortillas. Waitress was kind, but kept bringing our tab while we were planning to stay for drinks. Overall, decent restaurant that just needs a few tweaks to play well in the Charlotte market."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim today. I've pased.this place so many times and wanted to stop in. seating was a breeze. we even scored seating outside on the patio in the comfy chairs!! You must try the guacamole! they make it table side. Super fresh! To eat we had the Baba Burger (cooked to perfection), Flank Steak, and the Cuban sandwich..everyone in our party enjoyed their food! For dessert we tried the bread pudding which was yummy as well. overall the service was excellent. had 2 managers check in on us as well as our server who was great. The bartender was a little slow but the drinks were so good it didn't matter lol. we'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Went on a Sunday night around 6:00 pm. The outdoor patio is covered and dog friendly. Server was friendly and our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered a ceasar salad and a pollo frito taco. The ceasar salad was delicious! It is made differently than what a ceasar salad usually is made with but offered cotija cheese and radish. Good portion. The pollo frito taco was kinda small but the taste is worth it! My bf ordered grilled chicken satay off the tapas part of the menu. The chicken wasn't dry and the teriyaki glaze had nice flavor. Give four stars because some of the tables outside were dirty and they were out of one of the desserts we wanted to try."}
{"text":"I really love this place!!! The food is always freshly prepared, great ambience, and great customer service. It's a fresh trendy hip place to grab good food and enjoy friends. The table side guacamole with bacon is EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"We had been anxious to try this place and finally stopped in for Taco Tuesday. We came in around 3pm so we avoided the lunch and dinner crowds and parking was easy (no valet required that time of day).  While the tacos were only $2, we were surprised at the small size. Apparently that's always the size so I doubt I'd return to pay full price. And the pictures I've seen that other Yelpers posted showed a lot more fillings than what we received. We each ordered two tacos - grilled shrimp and blackened fish for him and 2 veggie tacos for me. My fiancé claimed the shrimp taco the better of the two. My veggie tacos were meh - some bites were super spicy and I know it sounds weird but overall (other than the spicy moments) the tacos lacked real flavoring.  Also I knew based on other reviews and feedback from management that \"this isn't a traditional Mexican restaurant so we don't have chips and salsa\", however only having onion laden pico with the chips is quite disappointing.  As I cannot tolerate an overload of onions or cilantro I was stuck picking around the diced tomatoes. We decided against the huge portion of guac since it was just the two of us and we'd rather fill up on tacos. But it would be a great addition to add SOME kind of salsa to the menu just to have something to dip chips in for those who aren't pico fans and also customers could add salsa to their tacos if they preferred for more flavor.  It's fine to charge for chips and salsa but make it worth the price. May try again when the Waverly location opens since that's closer to our side of town but please consider adding some form of salsa to the menu."}
{"text":"Awful service. Made a reservation for 1:30PM on May 28th.  Reached at 1:25PM.  They said wait for 15 min.  Started asking them to seat us at 1:45PM.  They said to wait for few minutes several times.  When it got 2:15PM, we quit them, and went to Kid Cashew across the street for sumptuous meal."}
{"text":"Updated my review to 4 stars after I had a positive experience and wonderful food. Babalu just please get your staffing situation under control"}
{"text":"I like that they have free parking near the building. The food was delicious but not worth the price. You pay on average 12-15$ per small plate and for example we ordered the filet and it was one tiny piece of steak on 1 skewer. Our waitress tried to throw us the check before all of our food even got brought to us. We ordered 3 small plates to share between the 3 of us and only received 2 plates. She \"threw\" us the check before we got our food and didn't ask us if we would like anything else or water or drinks or if we wanted or split which we did. So yeah I would've given it 2 stars but the teeny tiny portion of food did taste delicious. That's about it. Other than that it's your typical \"plastics\" hipster meet up spot. Lol"}
{"text":"I was really excited when my friend took me to this place for lunch. It has a nice beachy, California feel and I kept telling my friend that I feel like I am back home in Cali!   Our waiter was super nice and energetic. We ordered the pear, ginger margarita and it was really sweet and weak (I had told the server that I don't like sweet drinks and she still recommended this). I also had to order an extra shot of taquila. For a $10 margarita, I would hope there would a little kick to it.   The food looked good when it came out but everything was served lukewarm!!! It seemed like every item was pre made! The side of kale was kinda gross And the ball of fried ricotta cheese was hard and cold. It really seemed like the kale had been microwaved  And didn't have a fresh taste to it.  The worst thing on the menu was the tuna taco though. The server was really talking it up but it was bland and waste of calories. It didn't even look like tuna. Looked like diced tomatoes.   I don't understand how a place can spend so much money on a gorgeous, modern decor and then mess up on important details such as the temperature of the food and flavor of the food. I understand that a new restaurant has to work out the kinks but if the food is not even good then no one is going to want to come back. Hoping this place can make the necessary improvements.   Overall, prob won't come back here."}
{"text":"We tried this place the other day and was delighted!   The chefs are artists and pride themselves on having the freshest ingredients to prepare every dish!  The waitress was professional and friendly and was great at letting us know about promotions they have a  We loved the atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Updating previous rating. Went in for dinner tonight. My margarita was great and so was the guacamole. I had the shrimp, oyster, and blackened redfish tacos. I had mine wrapped in lettuce. My favorite was the shrimp by far. It's priced like a restaurant but it's a very laid back atmosphere. I think it's a little over priced but the service was great and so was the food. I would definitely go back. More of a lunch spot than dinner."}
{"text":"I might give them another try after a kind hand written note, a refund, and a welcoming offer to try them again, on them.    This is Excellent customer service!!   My First Experience.. If there is such a thing as over greeting, this place accomplished it! It felt almost overwhelming walking in through the door.   The Food really wasn't that great! Esp for what you're getting. The drinks were the best part even though they were small and incredibly sweet. Our waitress must have had an off day, because she was short and I'm not talking about height.  The grits were edible but only because I was really hungry when I showed up. The garlic potatoes weren't even edible. I don't usually spit anything back out of my mouth, but this was horrible. My friend said the fish taco was ok, but nothing to rave about.    Our Order..

{"text":"As an out-of-towner, I wanted to make sure I was eating foods that are popular or \"known for\". A local at a nearby store told me to have some tacos! I guess it's a thing or maybe there are a lot of taco restaurants around. So she recommended I check out Babalu and when I did, there were lots of great reviews and knew I had to try it!  I had just finished shopping (lots of walking was done!), it was getting late and I was hungry! I made it just in time to put it an order and was I ever glad!  I was with a friend and we ordered the mexican street corn, 2 shrimp tacos, 1 chicken taco, and the filet on a stick. There was a huge amount of corn, way more than I expected and it was delicious! It had the right amount of seasoning on it. Our favourite was the filet on a stick, the grilled tenderloin was cooked perfectly! It was cooked to a medium (just the way we like) and melted in our mouths! It was tender, juicy and flavourful! It paired really well with the roasted potatoes and teriyaki glaze, so good! Unfortunately the tacos could've been better! The shrimp and chicken itself were really good, it was moist, cooked well and had great flavour! However, every good taco has to have all ingredients tasting good. The veggies could've used some sort of dressing or even better....pickled or marinated in a vinegar dressing....something to add a little more flavour. But they were still great!  Would definitely recommend it to someone else that would be visiting from out of town!"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to Babalu and it was significantly better than the first. I went a couple weeks after it opened with a few friends and our waiter was very inattentive - almost absent. In addition, the waiter accused my friend of having a fake ID and brought me cold food. I would have probably given that experience 1 or 2 stars.   However, I decided to give it another shot this Saturday and it was ABSOLUTELY worth it. We went around 6:15pm and were seated immediately. Babalu has a fun and casual atmosphere with an open kitchen and some outdoor seating. They even projected the Final Four basketball game on the wall! We ordered the guacamole for an appetizer, which was delicious and was made/mixed in front of us. The chips were a little thick and some were semi soggy, but the guacamole itself was really good. The guac is fairly large and can probably serve four people. I ordered the Fierce Shrimp and also had some of my girlfriends Baba Burger. The Fierce Shrimp is a little light in terms of quantity, but that is expected since its tapas. I would probably say the Shrimp is a little overpriced but still good. The Baba Burger was unbelievably good - I wish I had the whole burger. I will definitely be ordering that the next time I come. The bread is toasted on the outside, while maintaining a soft inside. The burger contained grilled onions, tomato, bacon, avocado, and cheese, and just had an incredible flavor.   The service for this experience was great. Our server Kyle was WORLD CLASS. We never once had to ask for refills or more chips. He was so attentive and brought whatever we needed. In addition, he had on point menu suggestions (especially with the burger). Highly recommend Kyle! He made sure to invite us back for $2 Taco Tuesday, and we will probably take him up on the offer soon. This experience at Babalu was definitely a 5/5 and Kyle was a big part of it.   Other Notes: - Babalu has complimentary valet parking, but of course tips are recommended -Try and get there before 6:30 because this place can get very crowded for dinner."}
{"text":"Babalu tacos are a fresh, tasty & affordable treat! We tried the tableside guac with bacon, too, that was satisfying with a salty crunch to the tiny bacon pieces.  The drink I tried was a Mojarita--margarita meets mojito. I Liked the mint & margarita mixer & the tequila was smooth. The tacos are $3 each or about $9 for 3 tacos.  I tried duck, cerdo(pork) & chicken tacos. All had good flavors but the pork was my favorite. The pork belly is tender w/ awesome sauce! The duck was a little too meaty/smoky with the asian flavor too. We will have to return to try the tapas! They sound yummy. The valet option to park is good for the busy east blvd."}
{"text":"When you hear the word Babalu, what do you think of?  Ricky Ricardo, right?  So I expected this place to have a retro feel both inside and out, and serve food with a bit of a Cuban flair.  While the sign and restaurant logo's choice of font and neon might lead you to believe the retro part, it definitely isn't retro.  It's pretty bare-boned inside, giving it a warehouse/loft feel.  And that part was fine, but there was way too much lighting inside.  The ceiling was cool, made of wood planks, but hanging from it were these awful fluorescent lights that made it feel like a cafeteria.    We sat at a hightop table next to the screened window, and it was the perfect night for it with the cooler air outside.  The service was great.  Our server explained that the tapas were a larger than normal-sized tapas, so that helped us pick out what we wanted.  I ordered a pineapple margarita and my partner ordered a red sangria.  Our server was standing with us when the drinks were delivered to us and she kind of cringed when she saw that the sangria didn't have ice or fruit in it.  It just looked like a glass of chilled red wine.  She immediately took it away to get it corrected without us even saying anything.  It's strange that she knows what a sangria should look like, but the bartender doesn't?  Scary.  Anyway, I ordered the shrimp and chorizo skillet, my partner ordered the shrimp and grits, and then we shared the beef empanadas and side of grilled broccolini with goat cheese.  All were delicious and served fresh and hot.  They came out sporadically, as soon as they were prepared.  My skillet was spicy, as I had hoped.  The broccolini was a nice addition since we didn't really have any other veggies, and it had a nice charred flavor to it.  I thought there'd be more goat cheese than a few sprinkles, but we made it work.  All were larger portions than other tapas I've had at other restaurants, just as our server had said.    Babalu was a nice dinner out.  I just wish it really was more retro and not so bright."}
{"text":"LOVED the ambiance of this place!  Fantastic seating on beautiful spring Charlotte days.  I enjoyed their soft taco shells (no hard tacos here) and the flavors were really nice.  A little pricey for what it is though. And, really,  chips and salsa should be free.  I've heard they have a good watermelon margarita...might try it again on a $2 taco night!"}
{"text":"This place is a local gem! Everything we ate was delicious, from the filet on a stick tapas to the black bean hummus appetizer. We came in on a Friday night without a reservation and after a wait were seated with our puppy at a table with couches on the patio. It was fabulous! Service was great, food was yummy, and it was the perfect night to be eating in an indoor/outdoor setting. We will be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I was a fan of Catina 1511. So, when I heard that it was being replaced with a tapas spot...I had some skepticism.   Not anymore.   Babalu provides a great atmosphere with great classic cocktails, delicious small plates and friendly staff. It's the type of place that you can meet with girlfriends for a few drinks and small bites, hang out for a great date or dine with the family. I visited with my dining club.   I appreciate the care that was given to the layout of the dining space. There are lots of table options including high tops, family style and bar seating. The restroom was spotless with a little added touch such as self-serve mouthwash...for all those red onions in your guac. But, more importantly, complimentary valet parking is offered, as the parking situation is quite challenging.   I highly recommend the guacamole which is prepared table side. Paired with homemade tortilla chips, it is a great starter to accompany your cocktails. I tried the fierce shrimp with slaw and 1 tuna taco. The taco was amazing. The shrimp were a bit too greasy and not what I expected. I sampled the crab cakes and salmon with cheese grits. I foresee both as an order in my future. They were both awesome.   Finished the meal with the bread pudding. I was warned by a friend that it would become my favorite...I'm a bread pudding snob. Well, let's just say it is a runner up to my beloved favorite at Pike's Old Fashioned Soda Shop...and that's saying a lot!"}
{"text":"My first time here for my Birthday lunch and I'll definitely be back. Our server was jack of all trades. The rose sangria was amazing, ceviche was fresh and let's not forget the table side guacamole. I have to bring my kids back here for sure they will love this experience."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times but recently went for \"date night\" and it was just lovely!   This is a great place for drinks and snacks.   We sat out on the patio, which I highly recommend. The atmosphere is modern and clean but a little retro.   The drink menu is tequila focused. They make their own mixers which is the key here. All the drinks I sampled (and there were a few!) were fresh, light, and delightfully tart. I am usually not a \"sweet drink\" person but out of all the drinks I sampled I was most pleased with the special raspberry margarita and the strawberry tequila mojito. They were on the sweet side, but because of the fresh ingredients, were not overly sweet. The bartenders were great. They were attentive, but not intrusive. They also happily made my date a \"custom drink\" - he's a whiskey fan.   We sampled a few items but let me tell you - order the ceviche. We are both still thinking of it. It was bright, flavorful and fresh! It's basically a pico with fresh tuna. I also felt it was a really good sized portion. We also shared a queso, crispy tuna, and the side of broccolini, which were all good. It is a tapas place, so the portions are small and dinner can get a little pricey.   But go - order a ceviche and a cocktail!"}
{"text":"I didn't care for this place our first visit so tried it again. Score. Much better food and service. Casual atmosphere.  When the weather is nice the walls open to enjoy the outdoors. We had a sampling of tapas and sharing dishes and everything was very good."}
{"text":"I met a friend for a late lunch on Sunday afternoon and it was a gorgeous day so we decided to sit out on their patio. It was a perfect choice! Trust me if the patio is open... I'd definitely recommend sitting outside.   Our server greeted us right away and I started with a pomegranate mimosa. It was good, very refreshing. Next up we tried the queso. Like some other reviews have mentioned it's not your typical queso - it's a bit thick and comes topped with a mole sauce. But overall it wasn't too bad. The house chips were a nice and crispy! I'm a fan of thicker chips so they were perfect for scooping up the queso.   I ordered a shrimp taco and the beef empanadas. My favorite hands down was the shrimp taco! I ordered it fried and on a flour tortilla based on a recommendation from the server. And she was spot on! I'd come back just for a plate of these! The breading on the shrimp was delicious, the cilantro slaw and comeback sauce added a nice kick!   Order them. Thank me later.   Unfortunately, the beef empanadas were not my favorite. They were just so greasy. I'm not sure what it was from but there was a pool of grease on the bottom of the plate. Once I got past that the flavors of meat, potatoes and mushrooms were good but I think next time I'll skip these.   My friend ordered a carnitas taco and a redfish taco and I tasted both of them and they were really good. This place does tacos right. And I appreciate that!   I'd absolutely come back, there are a few more tacos, small plates and margaritas that I want to try!"}
{"text":"Very slow service and they were out of avocados if you can believe it.  Also our meals came out at very different times and if this was purposeful, nobody explained that to us and it wasn't great for the kids.  We all thought the food was just OK at best.  They also served us totally charred broccolini."}
{"text":"I was under the impression this was more of a traditional Mexican restaurant.  I was pleasantly surprised it was not.  We opted to eat off the tapas portion of the menu.  OMG!  Everything was outstanding!  The shrimp and grits were very flavorful; the beef kabob was so tender and served over chopped cheesy potatoes; the crab cakes were not stuffed with a lot of fillers and were served on top of slaw; and finally, the shrimp and chorizo rice skillet was a spicy flavor bomb.  Drinks were also on point.  Our service was top notch as well and I can't wait to come back to try some other dishes!  We did get there early (5:45 on a Thursday) and had no problem getting a table.  It did get very busy by the time we left and I'm told weekends can be a long wait.  They don't take reservations or call ahead seating."}
{"text":"Great experience all around. The inside of babalu is very modern and trendy. It's open across the restaurant with a beautiful bar in the front and center. The windows are wide, the atmosphere is lively, and the food is great.  While they don't take reservations, I'd recommend calling if you have a larger party to speak with the manager, because in our case, she reserved a table for us.   We were in no rush so took our time ordering, and enjoyed the variety of cocktails and margaritas. I loved the the cat 5 cocktail with mint, agave and bitters. The mojarita (mojito + marg) and champarita were also delicious.  First and foremost, please promise me you'll order the fresh, made at your table guac. It's incredible and also fun to see them make it! With a blend of lime juice, sundried tomatoes, hass avocados, kosher salt, green onions and cilantro, this app is not to be missed. The house chips are pretty memorable too!  They have some tasty tacos, and you can order one, or try multiple. They make their own blue corn tortillas which are soft and amazing. Beautiful for photographing, too :) I went with one pollo taco (loved the cojita cheese and goat cheese crema), the pork belly and the veggie one. The pork belly was beautifully marinated with the chipotle citrus BBQ sauce and was SO delicious. I wouldn't order the Vegetal one again because I found that it doesn't really hold together well without the protein in there. And there's not enough veggies. sorry, Babalu, that's my only complaint.  The servers are all pleasant, the atmosphere is lively and inviting, and you'll leave with a full belly. However, my other quirk is about their parking. They do valet, so the line to enter the parking lot moves quite slowly. I would prefer to just park my own car!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were excellent.  Waitstaff were well trained.  Good customer service.  Clean bathrooms.  Will definitely return.  Fun for a night out!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to Babalu! I joined my husband and a handful of his coworkers for dinner last night, and overall it was enjoyable. It was $2 taco night, so we had several plates of tacos come out after appetizers. For apps, we had a couple of queso dips and a couple of guacamoles for the table. They were both great, but I especially loved the queso. The table ordered a red sangria and a white. I only tried the white. The group wasn't huge on the red, and would have preferred the traditional fruit+ice +wine combo. The white was pretty sweet and had a honey aftertaste. As for the tacos, I only had one (by choice, not because there wasn't enough food). The pork belly was pretty good. I tend to like mine a little crispier but for tacos and shoving it in your mouth it worked. Two in our group loved the veggie ones the best.   Overall, friendly and prompt service (other servers also helped out and checked on us); very nice open and fresh atmosphere; pretty good food. I'd go back again!"}
{"text":"After running errands on a random Friday afternoon, I check out Yelp for a food recommendation. Babalu pops up and I take the bait.    It's 4ish, so it's Happy Hour (hooray), $2 tacos & craft drinks! I sat at the bar and waited about 6-8 minutes before a server approached (hence the 4 stars).  Richard, the server/bartender offered me a menu and took my food & drink order. I selected the camerones (shrimp), pato (duck) & la vaca (beef) tacos with a side of rosti potatoes.  Boy oh boy, we're my taste buds and tummy happy! The tacos were delicious. The meat was tender and flavorful. The fresh vegetable toppings were light and crisp, adding a unique crunch and flavor to each bite. The potatoes were crispy and cheesy goodness. The seasonal margarita was refreshing and the infused blood orange slice as garnish packed a punch!  All in all, the experience was good. It's a cute, open place with limited parking, so going early during off peak hours is what I'll do. Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a cool atmosphere but I didn't care for the food. My boyfriend and I both had tacos and I wasn't impressed. The wait one was fine but I didn't love the queso and the tortillas where a bit dry"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and our experience was very subpar. The food was ok nothing special about it. The reason it's not a one star is because they had a great local draft selection that I liked. I'm a big fan of culture being king in the customer service world. Multiple times I heard a waitress share about not being paid enough or liking the job. Could be coming at 1:45 on a Thursday. Could be that 4 managers were just sitting at a bar table unaware of what's happening to there culture of the wait staff. I will try again a few months down the road."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place. I was really excited to go and have been since this place first opened. The way the restaurant is built is pretty cool. I went with a group, so it was 8 of us. We started with some chips and pico, I felt that the pico lacked a lot, and I just wasn't a fan. I knew I wanted to try the tacos that had all of the hype. I ended up ordering the 'Carnitas Tacos' and a side of fries. The fries could have been better, they weren't great. The tacos, were good but not great either. I enjoyed my meal and left full however, it wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be.  Also, I felt that our server could have done a better job at checking in on us. Some of the people in our group did not receive their food, thankfully we were comp'ed the chips/pico and them their food but still... Overall I give 3 stars because my tacos were good but it definitely lacked some 'wow factor' in my book."}
{"text":"I went to Babalu on a Tuesday with my niece and if you want the best tacos you have ever had and you're on a budget or even if you're not Tuesdays are the best because it's Taco Tuesday and all tacos are $2 and they are so good everything is homemade everything is delicious the pork belly tacos and the chicken tacos were absolutely delicious and also the street corn was one of my favorite things to eat there but you have to give it a try it is excellent food at an excellent price."}
{"text":"We really loved this place. Besides the pleasant staff, there's huge TV's for watching sports, and \"I Love Lucy\" episodes, I think. Seriously, when I saw Babalu, I began singing the song just as Ricky Ricardo did on the show. And I'm pretty sure I saw something of the sort playing on one of the televisions before the NBA playoff game began.   On to the food...that asparagus with goat cheese, if I lived closer, I'd order that nightly and inhale it in the privacy of my own home, along with the shrimp,...just the right amount of spice. We also ordered the rosé sangria. Mmmmmm, the first sip was a little strange to me. It just didn't taste the way I wanted it to. But after the first glass, the subsequent glasses were quite enjoyable! :-)  We will definitely visit again, and so should you!"}
{"text":"If you love street tacos then this place is a must try. Continuous running of I love Lucy makes u want to just sit around all day, eating and drinking. Cool environment and tacos are spot on. I recommend to go on Taco Tuesday as it's cheaper."}
{"text":"Great service from Taylor! Super sweet and did not ever leave us stranded. She was there when we needed her. Food was amazing and also at a great price. Atmosphere was perfection! Nice and relaxing."}
{"text":"Good tacos. Had the the tuna, pork belly, and shrimp. Shrimp was the best with tuna close behind. The tres leche cake was also top notch. One of if not the best I had. They let me even bring my pup on the patio."}
{"text":"Food was average but the service was terrible. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. Food took forever to come to our table. Hostess was rude, our waiter was also the bartender running all over the restaurant.."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have been my go-to for celebrations this past year. Local restaurants should take note Babalu does such a good job of making moments memorable with their celebration sparkler bottles! The pineapple margs keep me coming but their taco Tuesday is everything. On Tuesdays their tacos are just $2, this is a great deal because their signature tacos are beyond basic. The flavors are fun and creative and include fresh house-made sauces, cremas and slaws to compliment the protein varieties. My favorites are ATUN and Blacked Red Fish. I've been here a lot and always have great service but Ashley and Carlos are my favs. Ambiance is fun and festive, their patio is clutch in the warmer months and the foot door opener in the ladies room makes my inner semi-germaphobic self so happy!"}
{"text":"Would've rated this 0 stars if that was an option.. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time here.  You would think that a restaurant who offers a \"Taco Tuesday\" special, would be prepared and well staffed for that day. Service is HORRIBLE, Placed our appetizer and entrée order at the same time. It took over 15 minutes to just get the appetizer. We ordered their \"queso,\" which was to be served with pico de gallo, salsa roja, and chips.  Babalu's version of \"queso\" is simply melted cheese with a layer of grease on top. There was a small \"shooter\" of pico de gallo, and no salsa.  Honestly, you're better off melting some cheese in your microwave at home.   We then waited over 40 minutes for our tacos, which is ridiculous. Again, you would think a restaurant near downtown would understand people usually stopping by during the work week are in for a quick bite, not a 4 hour meal. Our server continuously told us \"the food should be right out\" but just a false promise.  Because my co-workers and I needed to get back to work, we decided to ask for our food to-go. This apparently meant we were going to wait another 20 minutes. We left with to-go containers, over an hour after we had arrived...only for us to get back to work and see that only some of the tacos were fully made, the other tacos weren't made, ingredients were just thrown together in the box.  Babalu's idea of  \"tacos\"? The tortilla + 1 strand of lettuce + 1 tomato cube. Seriously?  Over an hour of waiting, and that's what I get?   There was not a large crowd of people during this time, and there were plenty of staff in the kitchen at the time. I'm struggling to understand how we waited over an hour for a tortilla and a strand of lettuce? You're better off buying an El Paso meal kit from Harris Teeter and making it yourself.    Needless to say I was livid, I considered talking to a manager but figured that would require another 20+ minute wait.  This was the worst service I've ever experienced in Charlotte. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Went to the grand opening today and was expecting a lot more to be honest. The tacos are EXTREMELY small for the price, and they do not even pack a lot of meet into them, between the pricy tacos and the $4.50 Chips and Pico de Gallo (yes not salsa its literally chopped tomatoes, onions, and celantro) I am not sure if I will be back--Ive been to my fair share of Taco joints in the Charlotte area and I was very unimpressed.  One of the managers approached us after our waiter told him that we thought the tacos were small and he did try and make it right and order us 3 more (one for each of us) for free but those took 20 minutes to get back to us and this was after we had closed out our tabs.  Service was great we always had out drinks filled and they were always asking us how we were and if we needed anything ( a little to much hah)   All in all in regards to the overall food I wasnt impressed, service was good but it was a little to pricey for what you get"}
{"text":"Be careful with pineapple Margarita!!  Wife got one.  Drink tasted only like sour mix   Not much alcohol.  One lil pineapple cube.  THEN she ate pineapple-WOW.  It hit her like 2 shots.  (Doing this on an empty stomach does not help.)  We asked.  The pineapple tequila infused for 2 weeks.  (Read fine print on menu.)  I had TC tea.  Meh. Server Adam.  Dropped off his card. Food:  Guac table side.  Very good. Sun dried tomatoes added nice touch.  Disappointed our chips seemed like they were leftovers from bottom of box. Not much size to him. Lil chips.  After using up big ones, mixed chips wit guac.  We did get more from server. Tried small cheesy grits ball. Meh.  Very heavy.   Bland.  Did not even finish 1/2. Fierce Shrimp.  Very good.  Medium sized.  Good crust.  Good portion. Flavorful.  Spicy-but not too hot or overbearing.  Slaw included meh. Shrimp n Grits.  Disappointing.  4 shrimp. One was not cleaned all the way, still had shell and legs on it.  Good size shrimp.  Flavorful. Tasty. Sauce and toppings OK.  Grits were same cheesy ball we tried earlier.  HEV-ee.  2 pcs of toast. Did not finish.  (Adam said he had a customer from New Orleans who said Babalu shrimp n grits were better than she gets from there.  Either the lady has really low, low, expectations.  Or Adam lied.  I believe second.) When done felt heavy.  Loaded. Staff all seemed nice.  A few small hiccups. New place.  New people.  Will work things out.  Parking, Valet parking.  Fills up quick.  Parkers nice guys.  We had them check wait time before parking.  They did.  Appreciate it guys. Looking forward to repeating.  Lighter fare. I wonder if 3 Stooges will still be playing on big screens all over in there.  We like those guys."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Lots of good menu items and even though they are tapas, they are definitely filling. Cool atmosphere too. They have valet parking, which is a plus, because of how packed this area is."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and plentiful. Our waitress was great and very sweet.  The Food came out promptly.  My only negative was that there did not seem to be much alcohol in the Sangria.   It seemed to be very tasty water.  I would return but skip the drinks."}
{"text":"I would give it 3.5 if I could! To start off, I absolutely LOVE the vibes here. It's so open and lively! Our waiter, Carlos, is such a sweet dude so the service was ON POINT. We got Tapas and Tacos. The tacos... I still do not yet know how I feel about them. The taco shell, essentially, it could be amazing. Some of them were made so thick that it just made the whole taco really pasty and hard to eat. I tried the Duck Pato taco and it really did not have any flavor. Seasoning was really lacking in the tacos. The tapas were better! My fave dish was the redfish tapa(recommended by Carlos) and it was phenomenal. The dish was bursting with flavor so 10/10 on that one. We also got the braised short rib. Carlos asked what we thought about it and I couldn't really put what I thought into words. The braised short rib was definitely cooked well for sure. There was this brown sauce typically found with braised meats, however, there was so much of that sauce it kinda made the grits hard to eat. I am allergic to avocados, so I did not get to try the guac but I was told it was really good! Some menu items are a hit or miss, if I went back, I would probably ask what the waiter's fave dishes are."}
{"text":"Long wait, 2.5hr to be exact. Waiting for drink, .45hrs. Ah,  I was hungry so food was presumptively okay. Managers suggestions, come earlier. I proceeded to tell all my family from D.C. to Raleigh to Atlanta to leave work and come earlier. Point noted."}
{"text":"I did not like the tacos and I normally really love street tacos. I found they had very little flavor and were cold (Bakersfield's tacos blows them out of the water). The burger was awesome and the guacamole was great too!  I might come back for a drink, burger or tapas sometime... But I'll head to Bakersfield for tacos"}
{"text":"They have done a wonderful job updating the building and the ambiance is open bright and fresh. The staff is extremely professional and eager to tell you about the menu and daily specials. I ordered the Shrimp and chorizo and my wife ordered the short ribs and grits. We ordered appetizers as well, three tacos, and cheese with chicken mole.   Wow the food is indeed fresh however the portions are very small. Come on we are in the South; and the price is full plates. My food was spicy and fresh served and a cast iron small bowl. The rib was a bit on the tough side and the size of a small petite filet.    Don't get me wrong the was great along with the service but dishes were like snacks. You know when you start to really get into the food and hit that sweet stop of deliciousness and then boom there is no no more left. Well I have to give this place 3 stars as we ended up being hungry and hour later and the bill was $67. Food is great if you are looking for some fresh Mexican themed food but don't expect to get full without having to order a lot.   Nice experience and food was extremely fresh but portion size is for a child but Disneyland food price.   Nice concept but would only return if I was in the mood for a snack."}
{"text":"Here are our favorite taco flavors in order: Duck Tuna - Grilled  Shrimp - Grilled Pork Belly Red Fish - Blackened"}
{"text":"Went for the soft opening and fell in love! Food was amazing and the staff is super friendly. Food had an amazing presentation and tasted super fresh. My only negative critique would be the French press coffee. It was a little too strong and had a bit of grounds in it. Otherwise, the experience was perfect. I will definitely  being going back once they open."}
{"text":"First of all if they don't get 5 stars for anything else, they get it for one of the best taco Tuesdays in Charlotte. $2 for their great selection on tacos. Or just get there before 6pm through the week and enjoy $2 tacos. Their margarita's are pretty good, I always go for the supa babalu! I cant remember what drink but the pineapple one, get it! for nothing more than for the infused pineapple that comes with it, sure to get you feeling nice! As simple as it may sound, I crave their rice and beans! You must try! Also, I came here for my birthday out on the patio and they bring a wine bottle(filled with colored water) with a sparkler on top, you know like you're at a club and they bringing your bottles to VIP! LOL, Anyways I love it and will definitely take it over a group singing to me any day."}
{"text":"Went fairly soon after they opened. Drinks were good, but food was overpriced and not all that tasty. Parking is valet only essentially. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. The ambiance is cute and the service was good. The guacamole had no flavor - it's made at the table which is the most exciting aspect of it. No flavor. Same with the queso. The tacos we had were fine. For the price it's not really worth it- Bakersfield down the road is better. I'm Hoping the food gets better after a few weeks though, I really want to like it here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came for lunch because we saw amazing pictures about their food. Yet we came to realize that those pictures were extremely deceiving. Yes it look good, but it tasted terrible. I got the yellowfin tuna ceviche for an appetizer, which was not yellowfin tuna and it was rather tasteless. For an entree we got the shrimp and chorizo skillet and the steak skewer. Both were extremely disappointing. The steak skewer was just 1 over salty potatoes and the skillet was horrible. The shrimp was under cooked because it looked WHITE and the chorizo was undercooked as well. It didn't have the golden crispy texture or color. The portions were small as well for the price you pay you'd think you were getting something a little bigger. If it would've been good then the price was well worth it but not in this case. I don't reccomend anyone come here if you're looking to get full or be satisfied.  The ONLY good thing about our experience was our server. He was very polite and explained the menu to us very well. He knew what to reccomend and what not to. He said the cechive was bad yet we ordered it and he was right. Shouldve listened to him.  We will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Swanky, hipster riff on simple fare elevated way up.  Not for budget conscious lovers of taqueria, this place takes a dive into the pool of eclectic recipes designed to dazzle, inspire, and awe.  All at a price, too, which I think they've earned that right BTW.  They also valet park for free (cool), so do tip your jockey.  I'll return for sure."}
{"text":"Finally stopped by for lunch with a friend. So many time before I visited when it used to be Cantina 1511. But you see no trace of it left.. bright and airy.. A little less formal.. oh boy, I can't wait for the spring/summer months for the patio..  Greeted by a knowable waitress, she's definitely knows the ins and outs. She slowly explain things but not overwhelming me. Which is easy to do.  I order 3 tacos.. The chicken with grilled corn, pulled pork and the duck. As my side which is my go to when I see it on any menu is the Mexican style grilled corn. But an advice from my friend. She suggested to get the flour tortillas. Because she didn't care for their house blue tortillas! So I opted for the flour. Friend ordered the fish taco and a tuna Caesar salad. They brought the fish taco on the blue tortilla instead of the flour. Friend didn't like the salad. She enjoyed her tunas tho! So overall a pleasant experience. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"SALT. I felt like everything I ate needed salt. I don't even use salt in my everyday life but it was definitely lacking on the food. We started with the table side guac which I was looking forward to since they added sun dried tomatoes. It was quite possibly the most bland guac I've ever had, even with green onions, sun dried tomato, salt, and cilantro. I added some salt and lime juice and it still didn't really do the trick. The chips also needed salt. Thankfully all tacos that night were 2 dollars because otherwise I would have been even more disappointed. I ended up getting the carnita and red fish taco. The blue corn shells were cold and tasteless. My friend got the oyster taco, which needed salt. I had high hopes for this place since the environment is fun and open. Unfortunately I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Best table side guacamole I've ever had! Still waiting on a location to top it. Went for Taco Tuesday's and had the shrimp taco (camarones) and the short rib taco (costilla). Both were filling an delicious paired with the guac. I love drinks with jalapeños so the cucumber jalapeño margarita was right up my alley, so refreshing!"}
{"text":"I honestly dk what the hype over this place is about. Came here for taco Tuesday and was very much so disappointed. The only two things that saved this night was our awesome server and the table side guac. I ordered the veggie taco,tuna, and red snapper. They were out of the tuna so I had to settle with another red snapper(1 was grilled and the other fried). In the midst of waiting on our food, we had a server come and randomly drop off two tacos at our table without an explanation just a \"here you are\". It completely threw me off and what made it worse is that it was a steak taco and I'm pescatarian so I knew for a fact I didn't order it. We had to let the tacos sit until our server came with our true orders and then told him to take them back. To be honest the guac was great but definitely not good enough to make me come back. I'll pass on revisiting this place."}
{"text":"Went to Babalu on Wednesday and loved it! We ordered the queso dip and sweet potato fries as a starter. The queso was different with A kind of BBQ sauce on top but all and all it was delicious, I just wish more queso came in the skillet. The sweet potato fries were perfectly crisp. I myself ordered 3 tacos, 2 of which were chicken and 1 which was steak. The steak one appeared be a little more spicy which I don't mind but just note that if you want a milder taco. I do want to note that they do allow you to have flour tortillas you just have to request it. The service was phenomenal, Carlos kept our waters filled and got our drinks and food out quickly. I would definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Delightful light lunch. Hidden gem in Chapel Hill, with arguably the best fresh guacamole in town (10/10)! Barely any wait time to seating, but we found our waitress overworked, also serving as hostess which delayed our service time (6/10). However, she made a scrumptious guac in front of us.  Blackened salmon (8/10, pictured) was perfect for the foodie friend visiting from out of town. Pork belly and pork tacos (8/10) were a delightful conclusion to the afternoon."}
{"text":"My husband and I recent met up with friends for a date night.  Upon walking in the cool, urban decor and atmosphere had us hooked.  There is actually a good bit of dining space and I like how the tables are not too crowded.  We actually sat on the patio and while it was a cool, rainy night, we were very comfortable.  Our waiter was very attentive and accommodating.  On top of all the great things to say about this place, the best is the definitely the food.   We had a a queso for an app and the tried a selection of tacos for our main.  Before we left, we were already planning our next visit.  Make sure to check this place out."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place I really did (cliche opening line much haha), as the saying goes, however I did not. I will say the drinks here are good and the staff was very nice. So if you're looking for a cool margarita and a chill place to visit then this is it. Also their sangria was surprisingly delicious and I was a big fan of the rose sangria!!   If you're looking for good food, this place just really isn't it. Bland is the name of the game here. First and foremost seasoning, some salt, something is needed!! All of my tacos blended together. Actually my favorite taco was the vegetarian taco as it had the most flavor. Everything else tasted the same. All I could taste was the tortilla and then various textures.  We went for happy hour and got lots of tacos. I got the vegetarian, the tuna, pork belly, carnitas, chicken, and the beef. The vegetarian and tuna were the best for me and the rest could have been the same taco for all I could tell. Even their hot sauces couldn't save them. It was my birthday so we got a piece of tres leches cake (one of my favorite things) and I have to say it was the worst cake I've ever tasted!! Seriously it was terrible, made the tacos seem good.  They also brought out a bottle with a big sparkler on top that looked like it was filled with their rose sangria. Turns out it's just colored water and you don't get to keep it haha (we apparently weren't the first to ask).   Overall I'd come back and give this place another shot purely because the drinks are good."}
{"text":"YUM!! All of the appetizers here that I've tried are fantastic, but my favorite is absolutely the queso.   Drinks are on point (the shine-a-Rita and the moj-a-Rita are my favorite), the tapas are delicious, there are tons of vegetarian options, and did I mention taco Tuesday?? Can't go wrong with great drinks and two dollar tacos.   This is one of my favorite casual hangouts in all of Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love so many things I've tried here, like every single taco. Tapas and entrees I've had were all great."}
{"text":"Tried several things for lunch last week and most was average or below. Shrimp and grits were very good but not sure I'll go back for that."}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW: Ashley is the best server! I went in recently for a friends birthday and we sat at the Chefs Table. We were taken care of so well and it was a very special experience. I was blown away by the food (esp the corn) and it was so fun to be a party of the banter with the kitchen!! We got a bunch of different things to share and that is def the best way to go with this restaurant!! ONLY NEGATIVE IS STILL PARKING which I hope they can figure something out for that! This is a great addition for the Dilworth neighborhood!    My first and only experience was today and I left this new joint extremely happy and impressed! From the champagne margarita to the tuna tapas it all had my taste buds jumping!! I will quickly highlight that this is most definitely a TAPAS bar and you want to go here with people you are comfortable sharing with! I had two different tacos, the duck taco was out of this world!   Our service was also amazing and I hate to say that our server even left us her name on a card and I forgot to pick it up so I could give her true kudos! Our server took the time to walk us through all of the tapas and explained them all since we had quite a few questions! The hostess was all very friendly on our way in they even asked if we were celebrating anything special. The manager stopped by twice to check on us and we felt very well taken care off!   The restaurant itself is modern and stylish. I LOVE that the whole restaurant can open up. All the windows pull back so on a nice day it would be the perfect place to go and have some Rita's and soak in the weather while still being \"inside\"!   I'll definitely be returning to this new hip spot and I encourage y'all to stop in and give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow! Great time tonight at Babalu. Alex was our server and I highly recommend asking for her. She is so personably, absolutely a people pleaser and so in tune  with knowledge of menu and just the right amount of attentiveness. We loved the lamb sliders! Great flavor and tasty goat cheese on a soft brioche bun. Tacos in triplet; tuna, pork and shrimp.....all  delicious! At Babalu, it's all about sharing:) Drinks are a good pour, ambiance on the patio... sublime!  Great service, delicious food, cozy and comfortable, pinch me!! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"First time here and although the restaurant was packed, we still had great service and great food! Jessica gave us some awesome tapas recommendations (meatballs, crab cakes, and filet on a stick) and our drinks we delicious. Can't wait to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Best ceviche in town!! I love all their fish tacos.  Great service, and don't forget the mojarita!!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. Great food and service. Nice restaurant with valet parking cool decor and really good food. Had the chicken tacos, cubana sandwich, collard greens, really yummy and spicy, and the rice and beans. Also had the guacamole prepared tableside. Cant wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Babalu while we lived in Memphis and it was easily one of our favorite restaurants. We were so excited to see that Babalu was opening a location here! After eating there on opening night, we were happy to see that nothing has changed and the guacamole was still AMAZING! The duck tacos are the best tacos I can ever remember eating. I have tried new items on the menu almost every time and never been disappointed. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who lives or is even just visiting Charlotte. We will definitely be returning to Babalu many more times in the future!  Also, it's worth checking out the specials too, we were pleasantly surprised to see $2 tacos and $4 sangria on our bill at the end of the night!"}
{"text":"The food is okay but the concept of food slowly making its way to your table is annoying. Today there were 25 patrons and 23 staff but it took 15 minutes to get my drink order to the table.  I get the idea of sharing tapas but this should be no excuse for slow service. This place comes across as poorly managed with staff hanging around twiddling their thumbs because it takes so long to get an order out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"We came in on a Sunday afternoon and was about 40% full. We started off with the queso, but I wasnt impressed with it. It came out semi cold and hard. The nachos were salty. The service was really disappointing. Our plates from the appetizer course stayed on our table long after it needed to. We observed a table sit there with voluminous amounts of plates for close to the entire span of our visit. No one was there, it just sat there in the middle of the restaurant dirty. They served us (2 guests) 20 minutes apart. The overall experience was poor however the manager after speaking with us regarding our visit apologized and made amends. I'd be willing to give it a second try based on him and his explaination of the why."}
{"text":"Recently had dinner here. Ordered the streak kabobs and potatoes. Absolutely amazing!! The atmosphere outside was so nice. Our server was awesome too."}
{"text":"Ok first off- order the Babalu burger. No one has highlighted this beauty in their reviews yet and I must give it credit! A burger sounds strange from a Mexican joint, but trust me! It has caramelized onions, bacon and roasted tomatoes on it placed on a semi sweet bun. It's so good! I don't even know how to explain it. I tried it a year ago and got it last night and it was equally as good!    The street corn is tasty and I really enjoyed it- nice sharable too. I've also tried the ahi tuna tacos and I have to say they are a little weak on the amount of fish they give you. Definitely more toppings than protein, but they were still good to share.   Lastly, the fierce shrimp is a great shareable for your table. They weren't as spicy as I was hoping for, but they sure were tasty!   I haven't tried any of their other tacos, but trust me get that burger and you don't need to!"}
{"text":"Underrated!   Sat at table looking into kitchen -- highly attentive and interactive staff (though maybe because of where we were seated).   Homemade guacamole: delicious. Queso: mediocre. Tacos: fresh and tasty. Loved the ambiance. Will return."}
{"text":"Lucky me! My first visit to this festively colorful East Boulevard joint was on a Tuesday, and Tuesdays here mean $2 tacos! That made ordering pretty simple. Out of about ten taco options and I chose four: Blackened Red Fish, Camerones (Fried Gulf Shrimp), Chicken and Pulled Pork. All were served on house-made corn tortillas and perfectly dressed out with the tastiest toppings.  As one might expect, the place was packed yet service was still attentive and friendly. Everything is shiny and new, as well as its 96.5 sanitary rating. The only real drawback is very limited parking. But what's new right, it's East Boulevard after all.  Based on this first experience, I can't think of a reason not give it 5 stars, especially on Tuesdays. I'll be back regardless. It's a Gotta Try in my book!I"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is such a good deal - daily $4-6.   Best quality of Tacos in a Taco Tuesday around."}
{"text":"Came for restaurant week and loved the variety on the menu. We opted for the queensfeast menu and selected the following:  Smoky tomato soup Roasted cauliflower with spice rub The duck 3 ways with pear The red fish on this yummy potato, cheese and corn hash Dessert was my fav part of the meal (as always) it was sampler w/ a chocolate truffle, tress leeches cheesecake and bread pudding (this bread pudding is AMAZING, I would come back just for that) the last dessert was Mexican hot chocolate full of milk and heavy cream along with churros and chocolate dipping sauce.   Great atmosphere but parking is a beast on the weekends. Waiter was fun and engaging. Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Loved they way they make guacamole in front of you! My favorite was the corn bowl with the cheese on it! The service was great!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Babalu. I first went to the location in Knoxville, TN during a work trip so when I heard it was coming to a charlotte, I was excited.   I have been a couple times with my co-workers because tacos are the one food group we all agree on.   Babalus space is awesome, with windows that open for a nice breeze, a patio along East blvd, and some big tables.   They recently updated their menu- changing some dessert options and now have a cheese board (I don't think they had that previously).  They do specify gluten tolerant items on the menu, which makes it simple. Tacos come on soft blue corn shells and I love it because it's different than the usual corn shells.   Table side guacamole with option to add bacon-- winner.    My co worker loved the veggie burger, I can vouch for the brocolini with cheese, and obviously  . Haven't met a taco here I haven't liked. Also, sweet potato fries are a favorite.   The chocolate truffles dessert are nice and rich with a kick!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time tonight for a casual Valentines Day dinner. We were able to make reservations and took advantage of the complimentary valet. The atmosphere was well-lit and fresh and we were seated promptly.   The menu included typical taco and tapas fare to include Mexican Street Corn and table made guacamole. We sampled a variety of items to get an idea of the menu. I enjoyed the Pollo tacos, the Queso, and the Blueberry Margarita.   The guacamole was prepared fresh at the table and included topping such as green and purple onions, cilantro, sundried tomatoes and bacon?! Street Corn was too sweet and kind of bland. I added hot sauce to it but it was just ok. The Braised Short Rib was tender but not amazingly delicious. I wasn't a fan of the Lobster Risotto either. The lobster was rubbery and the dish was bland overall.   The service was great but I had higher hopes for the food. Maybe we will return but I don't feel like we'd be missing anything if we didn't."}
{"text":"Our entire experience here was incredible. From the service to the appetizers to the tapas to the drinks... out of this world. Ashley was our waitress and she went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. A++++++ all around"}
{"text":"I was out with a friend helping her make some deliveries. So she insisted on buy me lunch. Of course she a yelpier or yelpie ( don't know the correct term of what we are called.) So she did a search and found Babalu on National Taco Day. The only thing that would have made it better if it was Tuesday but it was Wednesday.  The tacos were great. I not a fan of corn tortilla, but even on corn tortillas the tacos were awesome. I really enjoyed them and wanted more. Then we had sangria s. OMG the Rose Sangria was total awesomeness.     To say I a fan of this place is understatement. Can't wait to go back and drink and eat more."}
{"text":"The service was great! The food, however,....the baba burger was decent, but the pork belly tacos were dry. One and out!"}
{"text":"One pineapple margarita, two pineapple margs, three pineapple margs...floor  I love Babalu! The ambiance is festive, the servers are friendly, and what else do you need besides good drinks and table made guacamole to make a girl happy? Our server warned us that the pineapple in the pineapple marg was STRONG, and she wasn't kidding! I thought it was just infused with tequila...just kidding its like a shot! It definitely caught me off guard, but I was on the pineapple marg train after that. The inside of the restaurant is clean lines, and modern with rustic touches. I love that they play black and white shows like Three Stooges and I love lucy in the back area! The screened windows give an airy and open feeling.  All of the tacos and tapas are delicious. My favorites were the steak skewers with the crispy potato bed and garlic cheese (YUM) or the fish tacos. I only gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 because of how loud it can get! The space can be a little cramped and it definitely is hard to carry a conversation with multiple people!"}
{"text":"So...the shrimp tacos were SO GOOD. Probably some of the best seafood tacos I have ever had. Next time I will ask for extra sauce on the side because it was bangin. The red fish tacos were lacking a bit for me. I could not taste the fish at all-only the seasoning. Just was meh but not bad. The short rib taco was very tasty but it definitely reminded me of eating pot roast on a tortilla, so I would pass on that next time. Honestly I'm going full force on the shrimp when I come back. The queso is excellent, its served in a skillet and is *NOT* runny...its really just semi melted cheese and it is delicious. I didn't get the guac this time around but they make it tableside and I will be ordering next time. Also had the house margarita that was on special and I could actually taste the tequila and not just \"mix\" so that was awesome. A pitcher of sangria is on my radar for next go around. I recommend trying this place out. Great atmosphere and really cool décor."}
{"text":"We love this place during the week, as typically we can get seated pretty quickly. The drinks are pretty elaborate and they keep the beer taps with diverse and awesome craft beers. But let's be honest, you come here for the food! They say the plates are recommended for sharing, but they are pretty large so I don't recommend a tapas quantity, depending on how hungry you are. We almost always get the tableside guac, but change it every time. I think the trick is 2 limes, and regular tomatoes not sun dried. The service is amazing too. The manager isn't afraid to get his hands dirty and put in work, which I think is admirable. He's a fun guy and definitely looks out for the customers. While sitting at the bar inside we often make friends, as the atmosphere is social and inviting. Definitely recommend the ceviche and street corn as staples, and pretty much all the tacos have been tasty. This place is good for a twosome or a group. It gets busy Friday/Saturday, so keep that in mind. Parking is also terrible so if you plan on going out after, might as well Uber here too. We will see you guys again soon."}
{"text":"So I don't usually go to a new restaurant until they've been open for a couple of weeks. Under the recommendation from an old high school buddy we went for lunch on the FIRST DAY. We started out with a Corona and a House Margarita. The beer was cold and the Margarita just right. We ordered the table side Guacamole. The Guacamole Star came over and explained everything that was going in it. She did a great job but unfortunately this was the disappointment of the meal. The avocados, although soft, were not quite ripe and tasted green. It definitely needed more salt and lime juice. There was just NO PUNCH to it. Not sure if we'll order that again. My wife ordered the Chicken Tacos and I ordered the Duck Tacos (the food I was looking forward to).  Unfortunately they had run out during the soft opening and the fresh duck had come in that morning and was not ready yet.  Having been in and out of the restaurant business a large part if my life I find no excuse in running out or regular menu items..... specials yes, not regular menu items. I ordered the Blackened Redfish Tacos, Rice & Beans and Street Corn. We were told that the food would come out in waves, which was fine. My wife got her Chicken Tacos, the the two sides and my Tacos came out. The sides were steaming hot and full of flavor. The small orders were enough for both of us. My wife's Chicken Tacos were perfectly cooked and the slaw and sauce were full of flavors. It was nice to find a restaurant that understands that BLACKENED means covering the protein completely with spices not just sprinkled! The freshly made Blue Corn Tacos were just perfect. The service from the Hostess to the person who took our drink orders...our server, Guacamole Star even the food runner were all amazing. The noise level was quite intense and the restaurant was only about three quarters full. Some Acoustic Dampeners would go a long way. Finally, read where someone complained about the size and price of the Tacos, there is truly no problem there! I usually don't eat at too many Franchise Restaurants but this is one I'll frequent."}
{"text":"All I have to say is.... $2 TUESDAYS ALL DAY!!!! ANY TACO!! if that wasn't a pleasant surprise !! lol Ok, I have more to say!  I finally got a chance to try Babalu since the traffic to get into the place wasn't a line down East Blvd lol I strategically planned to come on Tuesday, to get tacos duhhh! And with the help of my good Yelpers I picked some really awesome tacos!! The shrimp tacos fried were great!! They definitely remind me of bang bang shrimp from Bonefish grill (this is not free promo!) the Redfish taco blackened, amazing!!! The Porkbelly (carne de something??) was really good too! I was so happy with my choices and 3 tacos was just enough! The queso dip was pretty good, it is definitely thicker than normal queso but definitely work trying! Any taco Tuesday is not complete without a margarita!! The Shina-a-rita instantly caught my eye and my waiter told me you are only limited to 2 of those drinks, they are our strongest drink... Well I only got one lol it was really good but I was able to drive myself home.   Great place, the food is really good and the service was excellent! This will always be a taco Tuesday option for me!"}
{"text":"When you pay $68.68 (not including a tip) for a meal for two you should leave full and satisfied, right? Apparently here, the answer is wrong. The portions are so small and only average in taste. Do yourself a favor, go to Chipotle and pay a third of the cost for three times as much food, and better quality too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to opening day. We split the Firenze Shrimp (which was amazing) and I had a tuna taco. I would highly recommend this place! Great atmosphere, and great fresh sangria also!"}
{"text":"Always a nice place to grab some tacos. If you haven't checked them out worth trying.  Not my first choice but an easy top 5 contender."}
{"text":"Treat yo'self. Get the beef short rib small plate."}
{"text":"Awful service. Came in on a Thursday afternoon at 2 pm. Waited 15 min for a drink. Another 15 min passed and the waitress wanted to be \"reminded\" of my lunch order. After another 15 minutes she came back and said, \"Sorry, your order should be coming soon, we only have 1 person in the kitchen. At that point, I left. Will not go back. They started out great but have totally fallen off the cliff."}
{"text":"I think 3.5 is a very fair rating but they did nothing to make me rank them as low as a 3. Went on taco Tuesday and had more than ample service from the great bar staff. Steak, pork belly, and shrimp tacos stand out as the best - definitely give it a try on a Tuesday, or any day of the week as a matter of fact. The guacamole didn't disappoint either."}
{"text":"Amazing food, drinks and over the top customer service is how I describe this place in a few words. The place has a casual vibe which is very welcoming sometimes. What impressed me most during my visit here is that the manager was doing a great job making sure all customers are enjoying what they are served. In my opinion, that is very important as customer is king :) The lamb sliders are a must try, juicy and bursting with flavor.  A big shout out to the manager Nick, he is so amazing at what he does!"}
{"text":"Great setup, really friendly/fun staff and had a delicious champarina cocktail and amazing tuna BLC!"}
{"text":"Looking to upgrade your Taco Tuesday? These colorful, flavorful tacos reflect the bright, open environment at Babalu, plus service with more than just a smile!   The tuna taco stole the show with soft, sushi-grade tuna was contrasted by the crispy toppings, although we also agreed that the braised beef taco, just recently added to the menu, was a highlight. I recommend going for three tacos and quite enjoyed the queso dip, served in a small skillet so that it wasn't soupy, but rather stretchy and aromatic with just the right amount of salt.   The special blueberry basil margarita was nice and served in an easy to use low glass. The staff were attentive and the group beside us ordered the guacamole, which is prepared at the table, so we enjoyed the show. While the restaurant was only half full for lunch, I can see how it can get pretty loud, as there isn't much there to absorb ambient and conversational noise."}
{"text":"II really like this place. The ingredients are fresh and I've never had anything I didn't like. That being said, the in-restaurant experience is the better bang for your buck than ordering take-out. I just ordered lunch through DoorDash and the portion sizes of what I got are 1/2 of what you get dining in AND I paid the same price! Needless to say I will not order take out again."}
{"text":"This place is in the perfect location of Charlotte. I went to have tacos and margaritas and it was so yum. The margarita was sweet, unlike any other Marg I have ever had. The shrimp tacos are to die for. I also had the pico which was so super fresh. The wait staff are very knowledgeable. I will be back."}
{"text":"Hm. I really wanted to like this place more than I did. I came on a Saturday night (2/4/17) for drinks & tacos with a friend. I happened to arrive earlier than she, and I saw that the valet sign was out. I let the valet guys know that I wanted to just drive through and I was able to park myself in the lot. Here's a tip: I noticed that between 6:30 - 8:00 p.m., the lot gets packed so don't even bother coming in if you don't want to valet.  When I walked in, I was delighted by the bright, airy, and retro vibe of the place. The hostess was very friendly. They ask for your name (for the table) and if you're celebrating anything, so be sure to share! While I was waiting for my friend to arrive, I was asked if I wanted a beverage  (I declined). I really appreciated the offer though. Once seated, we were first greeted by the manager (I assume) who asked if it was our first time there and then explained the concept of the restaurant. They make everything in-house: from the sweet & sour drink mix to the blue corn tortillas. We then met our two waiters, one was in training, and placed our drink orders: the baba-rita.   The baba-rita was delicious but so cruelly small. Almost $10 for a drink that can be downed in practically five sips. I'm on the petite side aka an extreme lightweight when it comes to alcohol and that drink barely made a dent. Babalu, I beg of you, use bigger glasses for the cocktails. Sometimes restaurants can get too hung up on the stylistic details which seems like the case here.  We then placed an order for the ceviche. The chips are thicker, almost like a toasted pita chip, and the ceviche is tuna based. I really liked the ceviche, it just needed a dash of salt and maybe a little less onion.  Tacos: I took the advice of fellow yelpers and ordered the fried shrimp and chose the carnitas. Fried shrimp taco was indeed the superior taco but the carnitas was still good. The tacos are very small but I liked the blue corn tortilla.   I also ordered a side of black beans and rice. Keep in mind, Babalu's rice and beans are not like a typical Mexican restaurant. It came with peppers and onions; also needed a little bit of seasoning.  Dessert: we went with the apple cinnamon empanadas with ice cream. The empanada had a thick doughy covering, the filling was all right but nothing memorable. Ice cream drizzled with caramel was a nice touch.  Overall, the service was excellent and just may be the best thing the restaurant has to offer. I plan to come back, most likely during off-peak hours, so I can try the other tacos."}
{"text":"Where do I start? The decor and ambiance is decent and the menu has some interesting dishes.   Places like these are hit or miss for me because they aren't a particular cuisine. This place has mexicanish, cubanish, Spanish food among other things.   I opted for the Cuban sandwich, which was quite good. My girlfriend ordered the Mexican street corn, calamari, and empanadas.  The Mexican street corn was good.   The calamari which we ordered as an app never came out until after the food. They comp'ed the app which was good i suppose but I am not looking for free food, I am looking for good food served promptly. Strike one.   The empanadas were initially served at such a greasy level it was not edible. We notified the server. They remade them and they were good the second time but it somewhat ruined the experience cause I had my food and my date didn't.   The refills on the soda were abysmally slow.   Food quality and service need work.   Not sure I would be excited to go back but when the food is made right and on time the flavors are good."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I was surprised that I enjoyed Babalu - maybe because nothing seems to thrive in this location? - but I did. My friend and I went for lunch on a Friday, and it wasn't very crowded at all. The space feels much more open and airy since the days of Cantina, and we sat at a table inside. We were promptly greeted and seated, and our waitress was a smidgen slow, but super nice and helpful.  I got the three tacos - carnitas, costilla, and carne de cerdo - and they were all tasty. I think the carnitas was my favorite, but honestly all the meat ran together. I would have liked them to be a little bit bigger, but my waistline probably appreciated the normal portion. I also would have liked some free chips and salsa, but I get the feeling this is more of a Latin-inspired restaurant, not a Mexican place. My friend got the lunch special, which was two tacos and either a half salad or cup of soup, and she went with the salad. She also finished with the cinnamon bread pudding (waitress recommendation), and she didn't miss a bit jabbing her fork into the last piece when I said I didn't want any."}
{"text":"Had the guacamole and chips as well as the filet on a stick. Both were amazing. The tacos I had were good but the filet on a stick & guacamole is what will bring me back. The staff were all very nice too and they had some good local beers."}
{"text":"Brittany is one of the bar tenders. She is very welcoming and has a great personality. The music was upbeat and the food was delicious!!! I will visit this spot often!!!"}
{"text":"What a strange, strange dining experience. Could have easily been a 3.5, but the oddness just couldn't raise the curve.   Got there, wasn't sure if they were open (roughly 4pm). Have heard mixed things about the spot, that it's new, trendy and tapas. Worth a shot. We were greeted by a very friendly girl who opened the door for us, but then the two at the hostess station ignored us until the girl told them we were there. Strange. They asked how many in the party and what our names were for some paper card. Walked us to a slightly uncomfortably small table, since there wasn't anyone else in there it seemed weird. Then came the crazy.   The service was very strange. Our server, Kimberly, was friendly and awkwardly enthusiastic. Before we had a chance to grab the menu, she asked what appetizer we wanted, and heavily pushed the guacamole. We asked for a moment to browse. Came back, asked if she could go ahead and put in the guacamole. Told us about a taco happy hour (which was a really good deal actually - $2 on all tacos from 4-6!). We opt to go the taco route. It was uncomfortable as, when we ordered, we were almost chastised for ordering so much. We each ordered 7 tacos (she told us they were small - so for $2 each, why not?). She said it's too much food for two girls. What?! We ordered a side of corn. She suggested the small - because \"you shouldn't eat that much food\". Now I'm super uncomfortable. After taking the order, she again pushed the guacamole (even though we apparently over ordered).   Got the food. It was pretty good. The shrimp taco was easily the best. All the other meats seemed a little too well done. Dried out. Duck and pork belly should be succulent - not dry, chewy and rough. The chicken was pretty good. The steak was okay - but again dry. Maybe it was the style of cooking? The Mexican corn was excellent. Was surprised it wasn't on cob, but definitely easier to share.   During the meal, we were interrupted for the server to discuss my tattoos. We were really trying to eat and have a conversation, but were being hawked and just talked to awkwardly. For a hip, trendy place on East, you'd think tattoos are okay to have.   Towards the end of the meal, Kimberly came over and mentioned dessert (which sounded really good) - but threw us off when she said \"but you probably don't want it after all that.\" ........ Well, we don't now. Check, please. It's weird to have your server tell you that you're eating too much.   Never really saw a manager until I'm assuming ALE came in to inspect the bar. Anyway. For the price, you can't complain too much. Service needs help - awkward and pushy.  But for a new place, there's definitely potential. Might be worth checking out again once they iron out some kinks. But I'd definitely sit at the bar or somewhere else."}
{"text":"Would be 5 stars if the price were a smidge better. Yes the food is delicious. Yes the service was good. I just feel that to be 'tapas' or small shared plates, it was a little expensive, which made it hard to get more plates to share. The shrimp and grits for example are around $14, has 4 shrimp and about 5 oz of grits, which in my opinion is high for what it was. Sorry, I just loved the flavors so much that I wish I could have tried more items from the menu. The filet on a stick with the potatoes was my favorite, especially those delicious garlicky potatoes. The biggest deal of the night was my daughter actually eating guacamole. That was so surprising but she absolutely loved it. I'd recommend and go again."}
{"text":"I would leave no stars if I could. I visited Babalu for the first time recently for a Taco Tuesday lunch and was completely appalled by the service we received (or lack there of). We waited over an hour for our food during a relatively slow lunch hour. Our appetizer, the \"queso\", was horrendous -  basically baked cheese covered in oil with a side of pita chips. After sitting in the restaurant for over an hour, we requested that our tacos be prepped to go, as we were on a workday lunch. That took another 10-15 minutes. Might have been the worst dining experience I've ever had in my entire life. All that said, our waitress was very gracious and considerate. Will not be going back. Ever."}
{"text":"I love tacos, love tapas so figured why not check out this place! Inside is verrrry bougie! They have high chairs, and opened windows its a plus for us foodies who like to take food pics with good lighting. The struggle lol! We ordered Tapas style, shrimp tacos (grilled/fried), duck tacos, red fish w/ potatoes, short ribs, mexican corn, and table gauc! TABLE GAUC WAS BOMB.COM. I love how they make the gauc right in front of you! The gauc was so so fresh, legit y'all. My favorite was the redfish with the potatoes under neath. Shoutout to our waiter Carlos for recommending it! And for being an awesome waiter!(: I love how the potatoes were cut in mini bite size pieces, so it was so crispy and they were perfectly seasoned. Buuuut the tacos though. I'm a little disappointed, I was expecting bomb tacos the flavor inside the fried shrimp tacos were pretty good. I don't like the grilled shrimp tacos though, and the purple shell tasted weird to me it was also really thick."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly for lunch since it is close to where I work. They have the most amazing table side guacamole. My two favorite dishes are the ahi tuna sandwich and the lamb sliders. The service is always good and they have specials throughout the week. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was a great experience! The atmosphere is amazing; the color palette is beautiful and the food is just as amazing. This was my first time visiting so I chose something familiar. Started with calamari...delicious!  The Costillas and a side of broccoli with goat cheese was flavorful. Costillas, smoked baby back ribs were tender, taste of smokiness and sweet. If you like ribs give them a try. The pineapple margarita was good too! Great place to meet friends and enjoy a great selection of tapas and a margarita!"}
{"text":"This place has some great food. We ordered the tableside guacamole which was sooo amazing (it has sun dried tomatoes), tacos (omg the corn tortillas), and a couple tapas. The kitchen got slighty backed up so it took a little while, but the friendliness of our server Shannon made up for it completely. So good."}
{"text":"This is a place you really want to be amazing and it just fell flat.  I have now been three times and all three times left disappointed.  The restaurant is in a great location and the vibe inside is fantastic.  First off- you have to pay for chips and salsa which is a big pet peeve of mine for any Mexican restaurant.  The tacos all sound great on paper, but when they arrive they are very small and all lacked the punch of flavor the description promised (with the exception of the blackened redfish which was really good).  I give this two stars based on the tableside guac alone.  It was worth the price and the sun-dried tomatoes were a pleasant twist.  If I go back it will be to sit at the bar and grab some drinks and guac, pass on rest."}
{"text":"Wow this place was fantastic!!! I enjoyed the tableside guacamole. The flavor was great and it was enhanced by the sun dried tomatoes. I tried the carne de vaca taco. The smoky flavor paired with the flavors of steak and pico were lovely. For my entree I had the short ribs. Delicious. They were spicy, smoky and savory all at the same time. The grits were to die for. The texture of them was amazing. I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Blah! Please don't go here. Lackluster menu. Watered down cocktails. Tasteless food. Overbearing waiter. The hostess and valet were lovely. That's the only nice thing I can say about our experience. So many better options in CLT for chips and guacamole and margaritas. We ordered drinks and guacamole and tapas. Not one thing I would order again. Saw a bunch of kids when we arrived at 6:30, so maybe that's their target audience. Kids with low standards."}
{"text":"Came by last night (Wednesday) after being quoted an hour and a half wait at Bakersfield. Our party of 7 was seated right away at a long high table. The decor of the restaurant is bright and trendy. It took me a while to realize this place used to be Cantina 1511! They have an open kitchen which is fun and the bar area is lovely. Our waiter was hilarious and sassy and very patient with our large party. We ordered cocktails (the pineapple margarita was very dangerous) and queso (yum!). The chips on their own were delicious and the queso was stringy and divine. Half of our table shared tapas and the other half had tacos. The tacos reps really enjoyed the pork belly taco but were not so crazy about the carnitas with peanut slaw. As for the tapas, we ordered the salmon (delicious!), tamale (super good), and short ribs (also good!). I loved sharing small plates and talking about the food. I think the taco orderers were jealous. Before bringing out our check our server brought us tequila infused pineapples as a treat, he really was wonderful (I think his name was Eric but I can't remember because he initially joked his name was Jennifer). We had a great time and I'll probably be back sans husband. Definitely a great place for a GNO!"}
{"text":"My moms favorite place to brunch! My fav is the French toast- not too sweet! Just the way I like it, staff is always friendly and cheerful to be around. I'm always able to find parking and just love the outside patio because of the sunlight and the fact that I can bring my 1 year old terrier to lunch with me! Also moms fav is the bread pudding"}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch here and both enjoyed it!  Started off with the table made guacamole and added jalapeño and bacon to take it up a notch. I got the blackened redfish taco which was great and the fierce shrimp. I really liked the shrimp but not for just one person to eat as it's fried (my friend doesn't like seafood).  For dessert, we got a sampler (choice of 3) of double cayenne fudge and a cinnamon bread pudding. Both were fantastic!  It was definitely a little pricier lunch, especially for Mexican but we enjoyed it. The atmosphere was so bright, airy, and fun and the service was really good."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place.  They're playing I Love Lucy on two walls with a couple projectors and the crowd is nice and upbeat.  Their food is even better!  I didn't get a pic of their queso dip with chorizo but it is the best I've ever had!  Their chips are great and think they're homemade.  Their drinks are awesome as well!  My boyfriend and I had a date night there and got a lot of different drinks and they didn't disappoint!  Im going back with my girlfriends this Monday!"}
{"text":"Been there a few times. The shrimp tacos are my favorite. A bit pricey for their small portions but they have great specials throughout the week. Only 4 Stars because the service could be better. Seated quickly and order taken promptly but every time I've been there, I've had to flag down our server for drink refills, our check or takeout boxes."}
{"text":"Went here tonight on a whim since I had driven by it a couple times over the past weeks.  Tacos are my favorite food and was down to see how these size up to places like Cabo Fish Taco or Bakersfield just down the block.  First thing I'll say was that I was surprised by the valet parking.  We got there about 6pm and there were still plenty of open spots in the parking lot.  I was confused as to why they wouldn't let me just park my own car since it would have been faster than waiting for the valet attendant to bring me my car.    The inside was very open and modern and seemed like a pretty hip joint, the kitchen was open behind windows and the bar looked very nice.  We got the tableside guac for starters and LOVED it.  The sundried tomatoes in the mix was very unique to me and really just gave the guac a different dimension.  You get a good amount too for the price, two avocados worth for $10.  I got the pork belly tacos ($3 each) and just devoured them, they were that good!  The blue corn tortillas were so soft and the tacos themselves had such a unique flavor.    If you're a native to the area, you'll probably know that Bakersfield is literally a block away and Babalu definitely seems to be their main competition.  Babalu has cheaper tacos with more variety in options, but I think Bakersfield nails the Tex-mex flavor a lot better.  This place doesn't hold up to the Tex-mex/ Old west vibe, but is it's own unique eatery with a nice range of options.     Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"I've been trying to get to this place for a long, long time... but somehow we never got a chance to... until last week! We went for brunch on a lazy Sunday. I think it was a great experience all around.   The tacos were good and the small dishes were well prepared. I think a nice surprise was their Bloody Mary (first time I ordered a drink before noon!) That may have something to do with it as well...  The service was outstanding, but it wasn't super busy."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits were heavenly as was the beef sayta w/ the hash browns n broccoli rabe.  All are must have.  Charisse W from the Bronx"}
{"text":"This place is overrated. The food sucks. The drinks are great and so is the guac but other than that don't come here to eat!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Charlotte, Babalu!  I was so excited to see the vacant restaurant space filled with another great spot to dine.  This is a great tapas-style restaurant where the portions are big enough NOT to share.  The space is really bright and fresh, and you can see the open kitchen if you're sitting on this side of the restaurant.  I have yet to sit in the back patio, but they have several tables there that are covered if you're looking to hang out without all the bugs swarming your food.  Speaking of food, let's get to the best part...the whole menu.  I'm loving the guac of course.  I mean, who doesn't like table-side guacamole???  I'm also a big fan of restaurants that will offer you veggies instead of chips for a slight upcharge.  Yes Please!  Although they are famous for their black bean burger in the Memphis location, I'm a huge fan of their plates and their chopped salad.  The short rib is so incredibly flavorful, and the ribs are pretty good.  If you're looking to just go all out, get the street corn.  You won't regret it.  Also, my favorite drink is the Pepe O'Mally...for all those Hendricks/cucumber drinkers out there, this is for you.  No doubt, I'll be back.  Not for the silent Ricky/Lucy projections on the wall, but definitely for the food.  Warning: the acoustics in this restaurant aren't great, so don't go here on a first date with someone you're actually interested in going on a second one with...better for groups."}
{"text":"Wanted to go ahead and give my update after receiving a gift card from the manager (owner?) About 12 months ago.  This time my husband and i brought my mother in law (MIL) for a nice dinner and drinks. I start by telling the host we need a bilingual waiter because MIL doesnt speak English. Had to repeat this to the english speaking waiter that we needed someone else. Bilingual guy comes, takes drink orders, no id verification (hubby and i look very young) and comes back with a damn strong margarita. Ordered food for the table, nothing memorable. But the entire time the guy was speaking to me in spanish and my MIL in English.. I told him 2 or 3 times wrong person until we just gave up and ignored him, even though he was constantly lingering at our table. MIL and i had a good time purely for the drinks, hubby wasnt pleased. We went to the hot dog place across the street and ate after we were done. There's too many good places in charlotte, Wont be back here."}
{"text":"Let's cut to the chase: fun place, but not great value for the money. I had three small chicken soft tacos.  They were very small and had minimal chicken, but a fair amount of greens and onions and tomatoes.  That cost $9., which was just too pricey.   I can only imagine that the cost of the ingredients was about $2.00, if even. I was still hungry after my three bite sized tacos and had to succumb to a small portion of fries.  There were just not many options, other than their soup of the day, which was a beef stew.  Yuck!  The service was fair, at best.  The vibe was really good.  Great place for lunch conversation.  Loved how the place was decorated.   I am not much on the tapas thing, as small plates are better suited for birds than people.  I was surprised there weren't more people there for lunch.  Maybe if they had some lunch specials and better prices, the line would have been out the door.  After all, who wouldn't want to go check out a place with a name like this?"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried out Babalu on a Thursday night. The place was nearly full at 8:30, but there was no wait. My first impression... This place is too loud. I'm sure it's a flaw in the building's design.   I love the way the hostess made sure to tell us our server's name and introduced himself with a name card. It's a little detail, but it gives the impression that he is invested in providing a pleasant experience.   The good was five star. My only complaint... The tacos were too heavily dressed and became soggy. The short rib came with some amazing polenta.   Everything was overshadowed by the waitress serving the next table. She was really excited about her pet box turtles. So excited, that she had to show everybody pictures on her phone and describe each one in detail. Did I mention that she was yelling at the top of her lungs? It was all very amusing."}
{"text":"Although I'm not quite sure if Babalu's is named after Ricky Ricardo's signature song (Lucy you got some splainin' to do, and no you can't play at the club), I can tell you a couple of things. They are in fact a chain with restaurants spread from Tennessee to Florida. The concept is Southern style Tapas, with larger portions, and a Latin flair. There's even a \"sharing tong\" you can use to pilfer food when your friends aren't looking - hehe.  My family and I were lucky enough to take part in the Friends and Family. I'm a pretty friendly guy, right?   First off, let's talk decor. Superb job! Lots of details from electronics outlets and purse hooks under the high tops to the numerous Concert/Music reproduction posters along the ceiling. Speaking of the ceiling - check out the barn wood on one half that leads into the more industrial portion. Really cool bar with some chicken wire highlights. A huge indoor/outdoor patio. Well lit and just a nice warm feeling over all.  We were again, lucky enough to get Erica, a really awesome waitress. Hard to believe she was training - she's obviously done this before!  To start with we ordered the table side guacamole - a \"Guac Star\" employee will come over and cut and mash everything. Two full avocados, kosher salt, some other goodies and sun dried tomatoes served in a 15 pound lava rock bowl. At first you might think - hey this needs some salt and I don't taste the tomatoes at all. Let it mellow - the salt melts, the tomatoes rehydrate and pow- it has a totally different flavor and is ready to eat. If you run out of chips just ask for more.  We tried one of the Signature drinks the Baba-Rita - which was a perfect summer drink that packs a fruity punch (of alcohol!). Hooray for having local beers - I opted for Eat a Peach from Birdsong.  Erica told us the menu will change on a regular basis - today different sections had different menus to test drive the kitchen.  The Carnitas Tacos on blue corn tortillas were a standout. I also really enjoyed the Sesame Crusted tuna served on Jicama slices - very creative. The Chicken Satay was nicely herbed and grilled - the sauce really added to the flavor of the rice.  Dessert was probably best - they really outdo themselves in this department. The warm bread pudding with Kahlua with a dollop of tequila whipped cream was delicious, as were the cheese cakes bites with the richness and texture of ricotta.  To sum up - some of the food was 4 star and some 5 star ( dessert!!!!) - what bumped it to 5 for me, was Erica and the other staff who were so welcoming, efficient and professional. Hopefully they can keep this up!  Babalu is off to a great start! There are so many great places to eat in the area that it only makes the decision harder!"}
{"text":"Babalu's offered us a tremendous experience being that this was our first time with the Tapas dining style. The menu had a large variety plates varying from individual entres, appetizers, salads, and of course, tapas meals. Note that there are vegan and gluten free items available. The service was excellent! Our server had a broad knowledge on both the drink and dinner menu, which made making decisions a lot easier being that, again, this was our first experience with this dining style. (Her name was Read in case you were curious). The over all atmosphere was incredibly friendly and welcoming, and all staff and management were accommodating to our needs. This was a great experience for my significant other and myself and we look forward to coming back and trying new dishes soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere, even better food! Love the fish tacos and you have to order the guac!"}
{"text":"The Good: Drinks- I had an off-menu \"house margarita\" which was strong but really tasty. My friend had the mule and was also very satisfied.   Queso- similar to Bakersfield in that it comes in a thin layer in a cast iron skillet. It also comes with a swirl of Roja sauce which almost reminded me of a mole. Really good! The chips are also good but I prefer thinner chips.   The So-so: Most of the  tacos- we each had 3 tacos ($2 each Monday-Friday 4-6pm). My favorite was the carne, which was spicy shredded beef. His favorite was the grilled shrimp taco. I am undecided about the carnitas, as they come with peanuts and peanut sauce. I am a huge peanut fan and still was a bit weirded out by the flavors. The tuna taco was my least favorite as I did not like the marinade on the tuna. I know people are very split on the tortillas but we both loved them! Not too thin that they split but not super thick either, and I loved the blue corn flavor.   Valet: it was fine for me but there was a line almost out into East Blvd by the time I left the restaurant and people in their cars were visibly annoyed. I'm worried that, although the valet is supposed to help prevent booted cars in the lot, people are gonna see the line and end up parking illegally in other lots anyway  The Bad: Service- let me start off by saying everyone was really nice, which goes a long way. Unfortunately there were some glaring mishaps along the way. First, it was a bit awkward as I was meeting a date and was only offered a community table. I had to ask if there were any regular tables available, and there turned out to be plenty. My waitress was also nice but needed more training. She read the specials super fast, prompting me to have to ask multiple times what she said. She also told us about the seasonal drink (blueberry margarita which is my favorite!) until after we had both already ordered our drinks. We both felt a bit rushed and had to ask if she could give us a couple more minutes to look at the menu when ordering both drinks and food.   Prices: I get that this supposed to be a higher-end tapas place but when you are charging for chips ($4.50 no less!!), the food better be amazing, which  I didn't find that it was. I think free chips would also help me be more willing to pay for the tapas (starting at $8 for 1 empanada...), but to be honest I can find cheaper, better tapas/Mexican food elsewhere in Charlotte.   I get that they are new and so I'm hoping they work out the kinks in the next couple of weeks."}
{"text":"Went for brunch this past Saturday and despite the fact that the restaurant was practically empty with plenty of staff, we had terrible service and found ourselves continuously waiting for our server.  After sitting there for 10 minutes, I took it upon myself to go to the bar to ask for some waters and some service.  When we finally did get someone to come over, it remained unclear who was supposed to be taking care of our table for the duration of our visit.  It was as if no one was assigned our table.  Over the course of the almost 2 hours we were there, multiple servers came over after I hailed for assistance, the chef came over at one point, and then the manager came over to apologize.  The manager offered us free chips and pico for our bad service which was nice, but then it ended up on our final bill. The server ended the experience by profusely apologizing, but since our food was sub-par, that did not make up for anything.  I will say the freshly squeezed mimosas were great, so great, that we tried to order a second one, but those never came... Really too bad, I was excited about the opening of this restaurant.  Hopefully as the staff gets more training and experience, things will get more organized."}
{"text":"Summary: OK - the subpar service was, in part, made up for by the quality food and drinks.  Service / Seating: We arrived on a Friday night (2 of us) around 8:00, and to our surprise, it was not overly busy and even noticed 4 - 5 empty tables. We were, however, told that there would be roughly a 30 minute wait (which was again a bit surprising, but that happens - reservations, people in front on the wait list, etc.), so we got some drinks at the bar. After a 40 minute wait, we were finally seated at one of the tables that was empty upon our arrival. There were several other tables that remained unoccupied after our seating, despite people for waiting for a table behind us. Additionally, throughout the dining experience, tables remained empty and un-bussed (at one point, roughly have the restaurant was empty and un-bussed and we noticed a couple asked to wait for several minutes on a table). I am not really sure what explains this issue. but it was quite bizarre and certainly somewhat off-putting (both the wait and eating amongst a series of empty dirty tables). Fortunately, our server was quite good with good recommendations and great individual service.  Food: We were quite pleased with the quality of the food and tried several different things. The guacamole was really good and I always like a little table-side preparation. We got three different types of Tacos; all of which were excellent. While I was skeptical of the Filet on a Stick (as recommended by our waitress), this was maybe the best thing we ordered. Finally, the shrimp and chorizo skillet was definitely good but not as good as the other items we ordered.   This was my second time at Babalu and the second time that the service/wait left something to be desired (I'm surprised I haven't seen similar comments in other reviews, but maybe I just have bad luck). The food really was good, and overall, made the experience barely worth the trip. I would say the place is worth a try for sure, but not one of my top spots in the area, particularly with Bakersfield just down the road. Hopefully, you'll have better service if you do try it."}
{"text":"Fantastic new restaurant in Dilworth. Love the tacos and drink selections. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Babalu was packed and jammin' the night I went and let me tell you why.  It checks off on every box when you are looking to go out; great atmosphere, terrific drinks, fantastic food and first- class service.  We were seated on the patio which I highly recommend, and since it was built up above East Blvd it gives you a birds eye view as you begin your trip to flavor town.   I ordered a traditional margarita but with no salt, and I was delivered one of the top 5 margs I've ever had.  The top had a tin layer of froth, fresh lime juice, the ideal amount of tequila and the perfect amount of ice cubes.  Well done, I highly recommend.  Side note, the other people in my party had some of the flavored margaritas which I heard were amazing.  I am not a fruit drink kind of guy but I tried a taste of the pomegranate margarita...unbelievably good!  Now let me tell you about my trip to flavor town.  Starting out we had one of their $2 happy hour tacos.  Carne De Vaca; the beef tenderloin was cooked to perfection while still juicy, the pico de gallo was freshly chopped and so was the cilantro.  Also, ordered a bowl of guacamole and it was a great addition as we waited for the rest of our orders.    Then the Grilled Chicken Satay came out; lets just say in short, we felt like Dorothy, we were picked up and blown away.  Just get it and you can thank me later.  Stop three, Creole Shrimp & Grits; they tasted so fresh and as if they were just caught in the Gulf.  Great balance of garlic and the creole sauce the grits were covered in, made me say \"Wow\".  Stop four, Fierce Shrimp; again straight outta the Gulf, it was spicy but the combination of the pepper slaw and chipotle chili sauce made me almost pick of the plate and run so I didn't have to share.  Lastly, the journey ended with the Cinnamon Bread Pudding; good thing I was wearing loafers or it would of rocked my socks off, so rich and filling!  All in all, I will be back.  The service was top- notch and I would recommend this to everyone to try.  The parking can be difficult since its valet only and can get backed up during the busy hours.  But all in all, thank you Keith our server, you did an outstanding job.  The owner of the Carolina Panthers should take notes from Bill and Al, on how a place should be ran and with that, thank you."}
{"text":"I first went to the Babalu location in Knoxville sometime last summer and thought it was pretty tasty, so imagine my surprise when I drive down East Blvd and there's a Babalu being constructed RIGHT THERE! Have been back a couple times lately and it's a solid addition in that location. The freshly made guac is out of this world. The specialty cocktails will set you back $10, but if you're hanging out in Dilworth that probably won't make you blink an eye, and they're good. The high point is the little tacos on fresh made blue corn masa tortillas. These are seriously the best tortillas available at any of the gringo-focused taco places I've been to in Charlotte. The taco flavor combinations are mostly hit -- especially the fried oyster and pork belly tacos. Go on Tuesday and they're $2 each and you can eat them until you pop. The one lingering question is: if a pitcher of sangria is $24, and a glass of sangria is $6, and you can only get four glasses of sangria out of a pitcher (per the waitstaff) then what is the point of a pitcher? Inquiring minds want to know."}
{"text":"Great food and the best atmosphere! White Sangria was great and service was top notch! One of the managers came and asked how our experience was and gave us a $2 taco card that is good everyday until the end of the year!"}
{"text":"OMG why have I never been here before?!?! They opened a year ago and I've missed out on such good food. They blend Latin, cajun, Spanish and good old southern cooking together to make the best food. The short ribs are to die for and the cheese grits are so great. My tummy is happy and I can't wait to come back. All three of the sangrias are amazing too!! Loved my visit and Tyler at the bar kept me entertained. My new favorite place"}
{"text":"My husband and I took our lab for a walk around Freedom Park and the greenway. With no prior intent on dining out, we noticed Babalu. We both love tapas and thought it worth a try, but the only problem was we had a dog with us and some restaurants weren't so dog friendly, even when they are well behaved..........  I called the restaurant and asked whether I was allowed to have a dog on the patio. Their response \"we love dogs and even provide water and treats!\", that response totally made my day. As dog parents, our pets are like our kids.   Now to the food:  Pros: prices, portions, quality, service. I felt as though for a tapas restaurant portions were pretty generous. I know a lot of reviewers stated that portions were small but usually tapas does not mean one dish will fill you up. Tapas is meant to be shared. The prices were not bad and food tasted very fresh. You even have the option for them to make guacamole right in front of you!  Cons: None  Favorites: Fierce shrimp (reminds me of Bang Bang shrimp from Bonefish Grill), Carne tacos, ribs!"}
{"text":"This place has a ton of potential. My boyfriend and I chose this spot for National Margarita Day. Excited for a nice marg and a few tacos, we headed over. There was a 40 min wait which we understood because of the \"holiday\" but the large amount of empty tables was confusing, but we understand having worked in restaurants, that things are not always as they seem. So, we grabbed a couple seats at the bar. The bartenders were extremely overwhelmed and the service was pretty terrible. We enjoyed the guacamole and would certainly recommend it. We each had the marg they had on special and it was also really good. To be honest, there was nothing wrong with the food, it just seemed the restaurant was not prepared. Tables stayed dirty forever and the bartenders never even cleared off the dirty dishes that were left from the couple before us...their glasses and napkins were still there when we cashed out! Maybe it was just a bad night but when you order things and never receive them, it's not a good look."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch I was pleasantly surprised I ordered the chicken tacos with a side of Mexican street corn  needless to say I can't wait to come back their guacamole is EVERYTHING!!"}
{"text":"Small plates / tapas. Sounds like a great place for after work, but the social hours are 3 to 6pm (3$ tacos). The portions are small. The service is friendly."}
{"text":"Okay so we were in the area, and were debating between trying a new spot or sticking with our old faithful across the street. We took a leap of faith and tried this place on a Saturday night. It wasn't too crowded since it was a little later. We walked in and were sat immediately. However, I do think this place is over hyped. The crowd wasn't the most diverse either, but it wasn't uncomfortable, just really really obvious.   I like that they have so many taco options not just different variations of chicken and pork. We started with the table side fresh guacamole which was no doubt fresh, but lacking in the flavor department, and I would've liked some options for heat level. I ordered the camarones taco which was a nice rendition of a shrimp taco, definitely not the average! I was debating on the redfish taco, so maybe I'll go back for it. My hubby had the pollo, which was decent as well. There isn't anything to jump for joy about this place but it is an affordable dinner before a night of drinking, or after early evening festivities.   Overall I would come back here since the vibe was good, and the service was great as well."}
{"text":"Babalu is one of our favorite restaurants in Charlotte. The tacos are out of this world.  We love their cheese dip with the chorizo as well!  We are also surprised but happy that there is almost never a wait when we arrive.  This is definitely a must-try for anyone looking for some great mexican food with a different vibe."}
{"text":"I feel this restaurant only deserves 1 or 2 Stars for the prices, food quantity and quality; however, I'm giving it 3 because we had a great waiter and the guacamole was really good (but not the chips that came with it). The teriyaki potatoes and three tacos (shrimp, redfish and tuna) I ordered were not good. And to make matters worse all draft beers are $8.25..."}
{"text":"I really have nothing bad to say about this place; I was pretty impressed!  Drinks: I ordered the Shine-a-Rita which was pleasantly fruity but not overly sweet. We came on a Monday and all margs were $3 off!  Food: Started out with the guac, made right at our table. The sundries tomatoes were a nice spin to usual guac and we found it very yummy! It was made with two whole avocados. We ordered two tapas dishes and then a taco or two each, which was the perfect amount of food. We shared the Fierce Shrimp, which had a lot of flavor and nicely breaded.  Then we shared the Red Fish dish, and the fish was Sooooooo well cooked and the potatoes and cheese were perfect. I added one taco to the meal: the camarones taco, grilled. Yummmm! I was extremely impressed with the food.    Service: Upon arriving we were seated immediately and #ashley came over right away, introduced herself, and gave us a business card. She did talk a lot, but it was to explain the menu, which was overall appreciated.   Definitely come check this place out! Tip: they give you $5 off if you über there and show you're receipt. They also have valet parking for others."}
{"text":"Second visit to Babalu.  For the first visit, I experienced the table side guacamole and it's good, but not outstanding.  For my lunch \"entree\" I got an Atun tuna taco and a vegetal taco.  They are VERY small with very little ingredients.  The vegetal was boring and tasteless.  The tuna was very good, but very little tuna in the taco!  The blue corn tortilla shells are excellent.  For my second visit.....had the shrimp taco - what an improvement this time.  A lot more stuffed and it was actually filling!  Also had the sesame ahi tuna with jicama, a tapa dish.  This was a disappointment.  Very little flavor....again, just underwhelming.  Our server, Diego was excellent as was the speed of food arriving to the table.  The biggest disappointment of the night was the parking lot valet disaster!  Stuck in the lot since I didn't valet.  It was a giant cluster and something they really need to fix!  Not a great way to end the night and not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time in Charlotte NC and we had Kyle as a waiter. The food was excellent, portion sizes were great, and the service was even better. I will definitely be back and I recommend this as a place to stop by in your trips to NC."}
{"text":"Happy that they could accommodate a large party on a Friday night.  The cocktails were delicious but  took so long to get after ordering.  We finally switched to beer because the wait was getting obnoxious. My tacos were alright. My friend never ever got her food even though they kept promising it was coming.  The rest of the table attempted to wait but eventually conceded because their food was getting cold.  The cantina concept is tired out to me but it could be improved with better service and more organization."}
{"text":"I read the reviews about parking and was concerned.  We were trying to go for lunch during work so needed somewhere that would be a bit quick. They complimentary Valet was great and super quick.  Our waitress Amber was knowledgeable and friendly and gave us great recommendations.  The food was fantastic!  Everything was so fresh and innovative.  The vibe inside was relaxed and fun. We loved the option of small portions so we could try lots of different things.  We will most definitely be back when we can take advantage of the pitcher of sangria!"}
{"text":"First time here but not last!   How can one not like fresh Guacamole made tableside with onions cilantro garlic sea salt pepper n the best sundried tomatoes - that last ingredient took the Guacamole to a new level.  Definitely will be doing this at home too  We shared shrimp  and grits which were creamy well seasoned and good portion to share with a lil zing but not too much.    Fire  Shrimp (not at all too hot) with a cooling to the palate zesty slightly sweet slaw and Mexican street corn  but off the cob! My only complaint is at one point I thought I found a hair in the corn but after finding several more \"hairs\" I realized it was the tiny silk strands from the  corn!   Whew! What a relief    Our waitress was very attentive checking on us often but not too much and even turned off the fan pointed directly at us on the patio!   Prices are very affordable too!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place!! We did take-out here (and take out is usually mediocre at best), but I was SO shocked by how good it was! I really loved the crab cakes and the ceviche/tartare, but everything we ordered was great. We ordered 6-7 tapas and apps, and that was definitely the way to go! Highly recommend trying this new spot."}
{"text":"Food ok. Operations has a lot to learn. If you don't finish your bottle of wine  you cannot take any unfinished bottles out if the restaurant.  They have been open a month and don't have all the proper papers. Left a half a bottle of wine on the table   I won't be back since the manager wanted to prorate for what was out of the bottle. Not a great dining experience."}
{"text":"The decor is nice and provides an open and bright atmosphere. The restrooms and the restaurant itself are neat and clean. My server was friendly and attentive! I had the veggie taco and the redfish taco- tacos were meh, the \"Chipotle ranch\" sauce made them better. The sweet potato fries were thick and delicious!! I would return."}
{"text":"Good food, excellent location, great atmosphere.  Overpriced for a tapas restaurant, tacos were average, great dessert."}
{"text":"My sister and I went here for lunch last week which happened to be taco Tuesday.$2 tacos. So we tried the pork belly, the shrimp, steak tacos ,and one other one .  We also got the lamb sliders. Food was really good.  However service was super slow.  There were plenty of waiters and it wasn't like it was completely packed out. That's the only reason I'm not giving a 5 ."}
{"text":"What I love the blue corn tortillas and that's it. The drinks are okay small glasses that make you feel guilty that you sip it in three sips as it's almost 10 dollars a margarita. I tried them 2x and they didn't hit it off with me. The queso cheese dip was different and I always leave hungry when I go. Everything is small plates or to share. Nothing that I had left me feeling like I needed to go back. Service was good as we sat at the bar both times but don't see my self heading back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service, and wonderful experience. Ceviche was fantastic and enchilada was the highlight of the meal. Pineapple empanada was also delightful. Going back asap"}
{"text":"Omg! Seriously the best tacos I've ever had. Normally I'm not one to go out for tacos because I feel they can be made at home. BUT...at babalu's nothing compares. So glad I found this place and the service was wonderful! The pork belly and the shrimp tacos were my favorite"}
{"text":"Average all around. Everything from the decor to the food was just... average. On our first visit (and, let's be honest, probably our last visit) to Babalu, we were lucky enough to score a parking spot right in front of the restaurant. Hooray for not having to deal with parking in Dilworth or valets! After that, our luck ran out though.   Once inside the doors, I felt like I was in a chain restaurant in Myrtle Beach. It is all colorful and cookie cutter -- kind of reminded me of Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville meets Nacho Hippo.   We started with beers and apps. Ted ordered the Greenman IPA but was brought something different. He's too polite, so didn't return it. I ordered and received the Sugar Creek White Ale. Overall, good beer selection assuming you can get the pint you order. We couldn't decide between the tableside guac and queso, so we got both! The queso was good -- no complaints there. The guac was kind of odd and bland all at the same time. I don't think the avocados were quite ripe enough hence the bland and the addition of sun-dried tomatoes contributed to the odd, tangy-sweet flavor.   After the starters, we ordered a ton of tacos because it was Tuesday and all tacos are $2 on Tuesdays! We tried them all with the exception of the oysters and vegetable ones. So, 8 in total. They were all just OK. Really watery/too wet. The fish ones (redfish, shrimp and tuna) all tasted a little fishy. The chicken and steak didn't have a ton of flavor. The only real standout was the duck taco. I'd order that one again if ever back for another visit.   In a town with so many amazing, authentic Latin American food (Tamaleria Laurita, Tacos el Regio, Tacos el Nevado, etc.) it's hard to stomach an overpriced, average meal like we had at Babalu. I get it's a safe bet for families with kids (and, there were a TON of kids there) or people looking for dialed-down Mexican fare, but I prefer the more adventurous, flavorful spots and will stick with those in the future."}
{"text":"The five stars is based solely on the tacos. I can't stop going back. Been there four times in three weeks now. Tuesdays all day, and Monday thru Friday from 4 to 6 pm tacos are just $2 each. And they're REALLY good.   The redfish can be ordered batter fried or blackened, and I highly prefer the blackened. That's the best. But they're all very good. The pork belly and the duck are also favorites.   My wife got a mojito one night, and we weren't too impressed. But the staff is very friendly, and the ambience is casual/kool. Maybe one day we'll try the tapas."}
{"text":"This is a sad story. For such great food, they have terrible service. It's unacceptably slow. I understand that it's a tapas place and they bring the food out when it's ready, even if it's not all together but there is a statue of limitations that goes along with that. Someone in our party ordered a sandwich with a side. The sandwich came, he finished it. The rest of our party's tacos came 20 minutes later, we finished those. Then 10 minutes later the side came out. Unacceptable. Server made excuses for how hectic it was, and it honestly wasn't that busy. Took 2 hours for lunch. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The right amount of food, the menu is perfect, the atmosphere is memorable and the drinks are incredible!! Specifically the Margaritas!! I have not experienced another tapas and tacos place like this ever!! Please ensure you ask for Taylor or Carlos. They're both THE BEST servers in this place!! :-)"}
{"text":"Incredible creative dishes. It's like eating the food cooked by Chopped chefs. They always make the most innovative dishes, the chefs are artists!  Blows the standard hum drum restaurants out of the water!  Did I mention the drink specials, dag gum mixologists creating tasty libations that change often so its fun to visit and find out the newest creation. Moon -A - Rita!!!!  Eating secret, get a nice drink, order a variety of food choices, keep your menu so you can keep new dishes coming, the only way to eat Tapas style.  It's not just a restaurant it's an eating carnival!"}
{"text":"Having tried to get into Bakersfield and failed, we walked down the street and decided to try Babalu Tapas and Tacos.   I was extremely happy we did.  The tacos were extremely fresh, and really delicious.  The street corn side where they actually cut the corn off the cob before serving it was a 10, and we also had the goat cheese broccolini which is the best way to eat vegetables... with goat cheese.   I got the home made blue soft tacos - one of three different kinds.  My favorite by far was the grilled shrimp, but I also enjoyed the carnitas taco.  Service was pretty good, but not special.  I really liked the atmosphere - it is clean and bright... I believe they also had valet parking although we had walked over.  Then came the bill, which was easily the best part.  For two people with beer, our entire meal was $40.  I also left full.  I have been looking for a good fresh and light taco place, and this will absolutely be it for me.   I love Cabo and Sabor but they aren't really fresh or a light taco place."}
{"text":"very tasty.  I went a few weeks ago for tacos and was totally in love.  the chicken, shrimp, and duck tacos are all amazing.  Then yesterday I went and had the queso with chips which was so super cheesy delicious, but very heavy (just FYI).  Then I had the chicken tamales which were tasty but I've had better...like more tender.  Finally i had the beef empanada.  It was ok, a little greasy, but well flavored.  A little too much crust but maybe if I hadn't filled up so much on the queso, I would've had room for the empanada."}
{"text":"We tried this place out over a year ago and were not impressed with their high priced tacos and table side guacamole. We decided to give this place a try again after receiving a coupon in the mail. We decided to go for lunch and to our surprise it was $2 taco (every Tuesday, and everyday from 4-6). We tried the tuna appetizer which was really good and tried a variety of tacos since it was $2. Tacos were reasonably priced compared to the first time and are much tastier. This experience has completed changed our initial opinion of the restaurant. I think that the owners actually took feedback and made changes. The only complaint I have is the service was a bit lacking. Food came out quick but as far as getting refills, check, and carryout order turned our 45 min lunch into about an hour and a half. We noticed there was one maybe 2 servers for the almost completely filled restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to the Friends and Family Event for Babalu's soft opening. Had to wait another 20-30 minutes after our reservation to be seated but the place was jam packed for the event so I wasn't too surprised. Service was a bit slow but everyone was so friendly and it was understandable considering this was their soft opening. Best dishes of the night were definitely the burger, beef empanadas, and the fresh squeezed lemonade! Will definitely be coming back for the great food and low prices!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere & food!   Venue: I love the open concept kitchen! Being able to see the hard work the cooks pit in to bring out beautiful looking dishes was neat! The old movies playing on the walls bring a nostalgic feeling to an otherwise very modern setup. I am a sucker for nice bar counters, and this place has them!  Food: we ordered empanadas, sweet ribs, and filet skewer. The ribs were a favorite! Very meaty, extremely well cooked, with a nice tangy slaw to clean the pallet. The empanadas had a nice flaky outside which kept them from feeling heavy like fried food usually feels, that's technique! The filet skewer was the least favorite and with that said, it was delicious served with a nice potato hash.   Service: the energy of our server was great! She was funny and not annoying! Which I appreciate in rewtaurants!   I recommend this place for a quick tapas and drinks place after work or on a wwekend."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is fantastic.  The Tuesday special makes this a great value.  My personal favorite is the Atun (Tuna).  I've tried all of them and each one is unique and quite tasty."}
{"text":"Food was a little hit-or-miss on their inaugural Friday night, but service was great, so I'm hoping they can work out the kinks on their menu. As a previous reviewer stated, the pico de gallo + chips app was really underwhelming. The chips lacked salt, and the pico de gallo had no flavor - it tasted like diced tomato with some onion tossed in. Maybe a more classic salsa is the solution here to add more taste, heat, and pizzazz, but the pico was very bland and should probably be used as a garnish, not a standalone app. The shrimp & grits dish was absolutely fantastic, though, and the chicken satay skewer was also tasty. The costillas (ribs) were another miss,  unfortunately - the mole sauce on it was so heavy on the cocoa that it had a sickly sweet, chocolatey taste that dominated the meat and made us feel like we were eating ribs covered in dried Hershey's syrup. (The menu description should maybe at least emphasize the use of cocoa, so guests know what sort of flavors to expect.) But our attentive server immediately picked up on the fact that we didn't like the dish, and the manager handled the issue beautifully, apologizing that it wasn't to our liking and taking it off our check. Smooth operators. Super professional.  Service here was very good - the staff is clearly well-trained (except for the host stand, where many of the half dozen hostesses stood around awkwardly and didn't seem to know what to do with themselves?), energetic, and knowledgeable. The management here also seems top notch. If I were rating based on food, I'd give this place three stars, but between our server and the manager, this place really impressed us on customer service. I hope Babalu irons out some details on the menu, because we're hoping to come back again soon to try some other items on the menu!  Tip: if you get seated right in front to the open kitchen, you have a front row seat to all the behind-the-scenes action, which is fun to watch."}
{"text":"We met another couple here for a double date on a Friday night. They were busy and we had a bit of a wait, but that was to be expected.  Our waitress (Adriana?) was very friendly and personable. Since it was our first time she explained the concept behind Babalu and how the menu items worked. She made recommendations based on her personal experience as well as other customers.  The bar was pretty backed up and it took quite some time to get our drinks - all rounds. The food came out at a decent rate. However, the other people who brought our food out didn't seem to know what hey had. For example, they brought out two tacos and said \"I think this is the chicken and shrimp.\" Not what we ordered but we figured it out. The tacos were small but good. Order a few of them. The chorizo shrimp skillet was spicy & flavorful - probably my favorite item.  Table side guac is good! And it's always nice to have a little show at dinner. Our other menu items weren't much to write home about. We also ordered tamales, shrimp and empanadas."}
{"text":"Love this Tapas spot! We had Calamari, the fierce shrimp, and Table side Guacamole. I'm typically Not a fan of huac until I had theirs! The sun dried tomatoes gives it an extra kick of taste and their chips are delish. Not dry and tasteless like many places. I've tried other places Guac after eating theirs and Ive yet to taste a Guac that taste as good. The fierce shrimp was blah. They described it as similar to bang bang shrimp. It wasn't! It had no taste and I was disappointed b/c I love shrimp and i love bang bang shrimp but this shrimp was tasteless. Not one taste or spicy chili as described. The Calamari was so good. It was served with a sweet sauce. If you like soft fluffy Calamari this isn't the Calamari for you. It was crispy but seasoned well. I ordered the Shrimp Tacos off the Taco menu and it was delish! The sauce was a chipotle ranch and I hate Ranch! I also ordered a side of fries which were crisp and soft in all the right places. The fries are the skinny potatoes but a tad bit bigger than your typical  shoestring fries.  My husband ordered a reddish taco and a chicken taco. He said the chicken taco was good but nothing to rave about but the reddfish taco was so good!! I had a small piece and it was pretty good! My friend ordered the lamb chop burger sliders which i have had in the past and I enjoyed! She loved them and said the lamb had the right amount of fatty content to hold the flavor. On Fridays they have $5 house margaritas which was very good! I also had a pineapple margarita. It didn't taste very different from the house margarita but of course it cost more. I have also had the Lolita from here which is so tasty! Our waiter was Kyle who was excellent! He answered our question with a smile, checked on us periodically, and made great suggestions. The manager Lauren who actually created the Lolita was awesome! She conversed with us about the menu and even offered us items that were not on the menu. Her statement was she never lets a customer leave hungry so tell me what you like and I will point you in the right direction of what to get. All in all I've rated it 4 stars because the ambiance was great, staff was great, and for the most part the food was great. Outside the fierce shrimp, hard chairs, and not so much pineapple margarita it was a great visit!!"}
{"text":"This place was so good! Everything is decently priced and comes out so fast! I love that the cooks can come out and talk to the customers and that the waiters are very involved in getting you the best service. I will definitely be coming back! I ordered 4 tacos and the shrimp tacos were my favorite! They come on blue corn tortillas and super filled to the top. Best National Margarita Day."}
{"text":"Unreal food, table side guac was fantastic, and especially the Filet on a stick, cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"Lovely little place with a great aviance I thoroughly enjoyed the food. The braised short rib over the cheddar grits you must try. However as good as that was one of the best things I ate today from there was there guacamole it's made tableside we opted for bacon and jalapenos to be added and it took it to another level. I could not stop eating it. Their drink special for today was a blueberry margarita yummy I wasn't as impressed with the pineapple margarita little too bitter"}
{"text":"Exploring around Charlotte and found this place.  We got greeted by the valet then got inside and was seated right away by the manager Josh nice guy.  Then our waiter Eric was very nice and to our surprise he was from South Florida.  We ordered the freshly made guacamole made at the table it was very good.  Then we ordered the beef enchiladas with queso they were yummy. Lastly my husband ordered chorizo and shrimp it was deliciously tasty.  We got the rice and beans and that was also very good. We highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A group of us dined at Babalu's on a Saturday night. It was our first time there and we all loved it. The atmosphere was really laid back, the decor was fun, and the service was excellent.   The ladies enjoyed the seasonable blackberry margarita and it was delicious! The guess had some craft beer on tap and enjoyed them.  We ordered table-side guacamole, ceviche, calamari, and hummus for appetizers and they were all very good. We also tried the Shrimp & Chorizo skillet and the Short Rib...again, very good! The table also ordered a variety of tacos, but I tasted only the Pork Belly taco and it was delish!!    We are already planning our next visit!"}
{"text":"Our service was phenomenal. Evan was our server and gave fantastic recommendations. Can't beat the tacos! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I gave Babalu a second chance and it was much improved over my first visit which was when they first opened.  On this visit I had the Atun (tuna), Redfish (fried), and Camarones (fried Gulf shrimp) tacos.  They were all very good.  They are, however, quite small and I would need at least 5 or 6 to feel satisfied, if I wasn't having desert.  At $3.50 each, that can add up.  Now on to desert, I had the Cinnamon Bread Pudding;  it was so damn good I had to order another after I finished the first."}
{"text":"Walter the manager is super nice and awesome - went with my friend one time and we sat at the bar ordered the queso and it's so fresh and cheesy - best queso in town. Also the tacos are amazing, my favorite is the fried shrimp one. You can get three tacos for $9 but on tacos Tuesday you can get $2 per taco. Also definitely try the margaritas!"}
{"text":"Great food. Good drinks. Really meh service. They seemed very disinterested in returning to the table to take our order. Great vibe and setup though. Also the mouthwash dispenser is a nice touch."}
{"text":"This was a dope little place. The food was good and the service was even better. The set up inside open and so is the kitchen. It's family friendly and there's a good amount of things to choose from. They got points because there was meatless food. The black bean burger was seasoned very well and I definitely enjoyed it.   The queso blanco dip was pretty damn good. We went H.A.M on the dip and the chips they give you were crunchy and not oily.   This place gets extra points because the staff (Leon), the bartender, and the hostess were all madd friendly ... and because they bring your food out as it's made and you don't gotta wait for the other suckas in your party to eat. Ha!"}
{"text":"This may not be a popular review, but I wasn't impressed by Babalu. We came for dinner for the first time on a weeknight, drove into the parking lot, then was taken aback by a (complimentary) valet service. Honestly, I wanted to back out of there since there were plenty of spots nearby within walking distance, and I didn't feel the need to valet in Dilworth! I'm sure plenty of people take advantage of this during peak times, but they should put the valet sign closer to the road.  Aside from the wrong first impression, we ordered tableside guacamole, 3 tacos, side of sweet potato fries and the black bean burger and a cocktail. Bad news first: I do not prefer their guac, even though it was freshly made, I think it was the sundried tomatoes that threw it off for me. The tacos were meh, and not worth the regular price. The sweet potato fries were good, again nothing special, and the black bean burger was pretty above average compared to everything else we got. At $8 though, I'd rather go to Bang Bang burgers to customize and get fries with it.  Sorry, I was not impressed and not likely to return, at least for the food."}
{"text":"Ate here a few weeks ago for Taco Tuesday's. Ordered chicken (grilled), shrimp (grilled), steak, and short rib tacos. As well as the shrimp and grits. My favorite was the short rib out of the tacos. The food was great; however, they barely had any of the drinks on their drink menu! But the food was good, so my family wanted taco Tuesday again today. When we get there a waitress meets us outside before we get inside to tell us that due to unforeseen circumstances they will be closed for the rest of the week!! Very disappointing! I'm really big on customer service and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here.  Our server Ashley was nice and super knowledgeable.  I had a really great seasonal drink from the bar, the crab cakes and cheese dip. Everything was perfect.  Remember that it's smaller portions, it's a tapas restaurant."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday for the win! We got there a little after 8pm and was told the wait would be 30mins. I was hesitent about staying but the hostess was so nice and she persuaded me to wait. I'm so happy she did bc the wait was only 10mins.  They have a small parking lot with another parking lot behind the resturant. The wait staff was nice and knowledgeable of the menu. There's a cute sunroom in front of the restaurant.   They have daily specials but I came strictly for the $2 tacos.I was highly satisfied with my selection of tacos. I ordered the Carne de Cerdo (pork) and two Pollo Fritos tacos (chicken). The Carne de Cerdo was amazing. I tried one grilled and one fried Pollo Frito taco, the fried chicken was better.  I will definitely be returning. I really wish I could remember the hostess name smh. She was really sweet and she saved me from missing out on some great food."}
{"text":"I literally loved every single thing about this restaurant. The service, the drinks and the food were all on point. We had the nicest server (wish I could remember her name)! My mom, sister, brother in law and I went to Babalu on a Saturday afternoon around 2 p.m, which was definitely the perfect time to go. Not too crowded, but it was definitely buzzing. I just like the atmosphere in general. It was very laid back. I ordered table side guacamole as a starter and it was very tasty. It could have used a little more salt but overall it was pretty good. Server was attentive. Drinks came out fast. Food was hot. Food is very inexpensive. It was just overall one of the better dining experiences I've had, and the weather was gorgeous! We sat on couches in the patio area. I highly recommend this restaurant on a cooler summer day."}
{"text":"BaBalu on East Blvd was awesome! Complimentary parking, all bright and natural lighting, home made guacamole and other baller items for tacos and tapas. The drink menu looked money too. Every server and host was so nice too!! I think Bakersfield has some neighborhood competition!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday was a great deal - $2 tacos. We also had the sautéed broccolini with goat cheese and it was delicious and fresh. Our server was Carlos and he was attentive, polite, and very helpful. The shrimp taco and tuna taco were probably our favorites but everything on the menu looked good!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Perfect portions. Perfecrtly cooked. Little pricey but probably not for the neighborhood. The waiter was a hoot#"}
{"text":"So yummy, been a few times, can get busy during rush hour times.  One time I got the Tuna Tar Tar, which definitely met my expectations.  Valet parking (because it can be limited at times)  I've heard they have great cocktails, so Ill be looking forward to going back at a time when I can accompany my meal with one. =)"}
{"text":"Really good (if you're not vegan/vegetarian). They have a lot of really good food, the guacamole was pertty good. However, for someone like myself who doesn't eat meat, I was a bit disappointed by how meat-centered everything is. Nowadays it seems like you ought to have a solid option"}
{"text":"Met a friend there for lunch on a weekday. It was my first visit. Parking was a breeze, but they have valet too, so that is 2 thumbs up in my book because although I am a hiker, I do NOT want to hike when I am ready to eat! I was greeted warmly at the door by the hostess and a host (who may have been a manager/owner?). I went to the ladies room first. It was immaculate. Already I'm a happy camper and havent even gone to my table yet.   Our server was personable and has a cute personality - meaning she connected with us, which is always nice.  We got the tableside made guac. Holy cow. (Like my daughter used to say when she was little, \"berry berry good...\"). We had jalapenos added which kicked it up a notch.  I got the grilled Caesar salad. It came chopped which is different than I have had it presented before. Not an issue. The difference in the flavor of grilled romaine is no comparison to the raw, and between the salad and the guac, I was in heaven.   Lastly, it was very affordable.   Granted, I did not try any of the entrees or cocktails, but for this experience it was all good on all fronts."}
{"text":"My husband has a slight obsession with tapas, so of course we had to try the new spot in town.  Interior is bright with a cheerful industrial vibe. Very open space and I love being able to see into the kitchen. However, the first thing I noticed was the noise level. I don't recall music, just the sound of a ton of people talking at once.   Our server was very friendly and perfectly attentive, and super enthusiastic. Overall vibe in the dining room was fun and energetic. Could be a fun spot to bring a group, not so much for an intimate date.  Anyway, the food was great! We ordered drinks (sangria for me, margarita for him) and the queso appetizer. Our server advised it wasn't the typical \"runny\" queso that's ubiquitous at Mexican restaurants--instead you'll be treated to a little skillet loaded up with melty shredded cheese and some salsa and pico de gallo. The house chips are great!  We ordered the braised beef short rib and fierce shrimp. Both were excellent, but the short rib really stole the show, and now I have an obsession with the grits that accompanied this dish.   We'll be back to try more tapas and some tacos, and next time, we'll bring some friends so we can sample more dishes!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  This is a great place to share small eats or tapas. The daily cocktails here are also perfect. The filet medallions are fork tender, and the potatoes on the side are fantastic. Babalu is in a great area as well."}
{"text":"I met up with a girlfriend during her lunch break at Babalu for Taco Tuesday.  We didn't realize going in that we would get our tacos at a discounted price -- $2 a piece. We were pleasantly surprised. Who doesn't love tacos and who doesn't love a discount?!   We were seated right away and were in and out in less than 45 minutes.  Great, quick service!   We started with the \"Guacamole Made Tableside\" which was great! The house chips were a little salty, but overall delicious. We devoured it quickly with none left to spare.   I ordered the \"Pollo Frito\" (chicken) tacos and my girlfriend ordered the \"Camarones\" (shrimp) tacos. We got three of each, so we shared with each other. I liked the chicken better but my girlfriend liked the shrimp more.  They were good!  I am somewhat of a taco snob, so I can't say they were the best tacos I've ever had but they are definitely good for the price.  I look forward to going back for another Taco Tuesday and trying the other kinds. Overall, it was a great first experience."}
{"text":"The location has always been a busy one no matter which restaurant lands there. The Decor is wide open and The Three Stooges playing on the wall is fun.  The food: my Duck taco was dry and uninspired! No real flavor and some cabbage shredded .. Need less duck more flavor. My Chicken Tamale was like caned meat, not as dry as taco but close. The spice was inconsistent on the dish some bites super spicy others bland! Our table-side guacamole needed more lemon and some salt ( waitress noticed we did not eat it and took it off tab). Waitress was polite and eager to give us the restaurant concept. I think maybe they will settle down and get their groove but our meal did not compete with other two places we frequent in Myers Park. We will try again."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying this review is based on the food alone. Service was great, and I loved the style/ambiance of the restaurant. That being said the food needs some work. There is a similar concept a quarter mile down the road that in my opinion is so much better. (Bakersfield)  I would not go back."}
{"text":"Solid place for tapas, tacos and cocktails! They have $2 tacos M-Thur 4-7pm and all day Tuesdays! Service is always great, love sitting outside, valet is a bit crowded and tricky when busy but they are still nice! Been here four times and haven't had a bad experience yet.  Shrimp tacos are delish and the tuna and crab cakes are yummy as well.    Love this place.  Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent places for tapas. I have been there 3 or 4 times and tried almost everything in the menu, all is good and fresh. Atmosphere is nice on the weekend and I believe it is a nice place for a group or people but also for a date."}
{"text":"The tuna is very fresh, the guacamole wasn't the best, just ok. The margaritas were great."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon and was seated right away.  There was a decent amount of people, but it was not crowded.  I sat on the patio, which is very open and refreshing.  The bar area also opens up to the patio and it has a comfortable feel to it.    The waitress was friendly and came to our table right away to introduce herself and give us waters.  The service, however,  seemed to dwindle off some as we sat there longer.  We ordered an appetizer and she didn't come back for quite some time to get our main order, and then later to check with us.  After placing the order, the food came out quickly.  I ordered the carnitas and the red fish tacos on flour tortillas (you have the option of corn also).  I also tried the empanada.  Here's the rundown:  queso to start: good flavor, but not a lot like you would expect-served in a skillet, with chips on the side.  The chips were good.  They were thick, but I really liked them. Carnitas taco-good, loved the peanut sauce, Red fish taco, liked the best out of my order, delicious flavor.  Empanada-greasy, but overall not too bad, not my absolute favorite, shrimp taco (which my friend ordered) yum!!  I would def get these next time.  I had a mimosa to drink-order w/out ice!  It got too watered down.   I was a little nervous to try this place because of the mixed reviews, but I'm glad I did.  The atmosphere is lovely, they did a nice job of redecorating the restaurant. The staff is nice.  I will most likely be coming back to try other things!"}
{"text":"I've been to Babalu twice and had completely different experiences each time. The first was absolutely terrible service. We always had to ask another waiter for water, chips or the check because we only saw ours twice the entire night. But the manager apologized so I gave them a second chance. The next time I went we had fantastic service! Our waitress was so attentive and the food was significantly better. They highlight the quac which is good but the queso is a lot better, very unique with a bbq flavor. I'm not a huge fan of the tacos but they're just different. The lamb meatball tapas were phenomenal! I would go back for those alone! Would love to go back in the summer when the outdoor space can be utilized."}
{"text":"First trip here and so pleased. Ordered the queso, red fish, short rib and shrimp and grits. All amazing. Red fish was the best. Great space and great service. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"For a taco place, I think the best item on their menu is the burger! It's to die for and actually goes well with the guacmole."}
{"text":"I'd really go 3.5 stars on a review here. The tacos are tasty, but the spice level can be inconsistent, even with the same tacos. The corn tortillas are fresh and hold up well to the fillings, which is always an added bonus with tacos! Thhe tacos themselves are on the smaller, 2-3 bite size, and recently have had more filling (cabbage slaw, etc) than meat. The vibe throughout the restaurant is upbeat and they're always playing either the three stooges or I love Lucy on the wall. They also have great deals throughout the week, including $2 taco Tuesday! The service at the bar can be hit or miss, but table service has always been great. The only other downside is whenever I go, the only option is valet, granted componentary, but when there are plenty of available open spots, I'd like to be able to park my own car."}
{"text":"A friend recommend the restaurant. I'm not use to tapa places so I was reluctant to try but I was  looking for someplace new to  eat. My husband and I order a 2 different tacos, wings and the fierce shrimp . Everything was excellent . We will be back to try some different dishes ."}
{"text":"Ok - not amazing, not bad.  They do a taco Tuesday special which is fun and a great way to try the tacos.  But why no salsa for the chips?!   Does this not seem like something every Mexican joint should have?  Put your own twist on it if you need to feel different, but give us some salsa!  The burger is awesome - which surprised me for a taco shop but it's what I would recommend!  Edit - I'm told they do have salsa/pico for the chips, but it's a menu item to be purchased."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch here! I ordered the pico for an appetizer, rice and beans to split (which was more than enough for two), and red fish and tuna tacos. All of it was delicious! The tuna was my favorite. My tacos took a little longer to come out than the other entrees, so the waiter brought us free fried shrimp! I love the food, service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"They've redeemed themselves!! Ambie, our server was knowledgeable and friendly, and accommodating. We loved her. She gave me a great drink suggestion and it was delicious. We ordered the queso with chorizo. The cheese was hot and gooey and the chorizo had a nice salty bite. The homemade chips were perfect for it. Ambie suggested the Redfish and it was crispy and delicious. It's atop these delicious, little potatoes and it had such a scrumptious sauce. The shrimp and grits are not what you're used to, but get them. I thought they were great, a little iodiny but good. So good. They were served on what looked like small mountains of creamy grits sitting in a sauce with mushrooms and it came with 2 pieces of a toasted bread for dipping.  Ambie apologized for the iodiny shrimp  and gave us a complimentary dish of the Fierce shrimp. Calm down, they weren't hot, they were perfectly fried in corneal and had a bit of  a kick and i can't figure out the sauce but it's delicious and it's served with a side of slaw, creamy and crunchy. Overall, i really Enjoyed it this time around. I'll be back. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"#1 I called for reservations for 6, \"Sorry, we only take reservations for 7 or more. You'll have to use the waitlist app.\" I tried to use the waitlist app, it wouldn't work. I called back, \"oh yeah, we're at capacity...I'll put you on our 1.5 hour waitlist\". #2 Once we got to the table, it took forever to get our food AND the guacamole we ordered with our drinks came after we got our food. The food itself was average. Not interested in going back."}
{"text":"First time here. It was Tuesday's so their $2 taco special got me in. Tried 4 at first and had to order 2 more. All total I had the chicken, beef, duck, blackened redfish, tuna, and pork belly. The tuna was my favorite. Blackened redfish was pretty good too. My server was Ashley. Super friendly and very helpful with choosing my tacos. Can't wait to come back and bring the wife!"}
{"text":"After a little hiccup getting a server assigned the experience was different and fun. Much of the seating is communal and makes for great conversation. The decor is fun festive and stimulating. The food was terrific. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"A good place for tacos. They also have a brunch menu! They are known for their tapas and rightfully so. Very good food in a So-Cal atmosphere. Great place for drinks and tacos in the South End!"}
{"text":"I really should have left when I first pulled in the parking lot and the attendant told me to leave out a back narrow alleyway and park elsewhere.. But there where spaces available? So we went in and put our name on the list because because according to yelp they do not take reservations? So anyway after waiting an extremely long time to be seated I noticed people that came in after our party were already being  seated? So we asked the host why were people being seated before us? Well aparrently they were allowing reservations that night.. Oh? That must be why I had to park my $$$ sports car on the street? BUT.. apparently we had been bumped off the list and the host went and had a table bused and we were seated immediately (happy) unfortunately that was not the end of it.. We order, apps come, delicious! Entrees started to come, everyone at the table received their food, except for mine.. No explanation.. No waiter.. Wtf? We waited and our server finally returned to the table because no one was eating... Come to find out my food had been sent to another table, What? Long story short they were extremely apologetic and my meal was comped even the chef came out and apologized.. We did not show anger and accepted the apology.. My food was excellently prepared and delicious, everyone enjoyed their meal also even though it was cold. This never should have happened."}
{"text":"My bartender was Britney she was amazing the best service I have received in a long time. I will be back every week because of her....."}
{"text":"I was really excited to  eat here..... I was let down.   To start, the restaurant was not even 40% full.... so I'm not sure why the service was so poor.... To be fair, as the night progressed it looked like more kitchen staff came, so the patrons that arrived after us may have had a different experience....( I know the people who were seated before us had a similar experience from their audible complaints of frustration.)  Overall, our server dampened our experience... She left our completed appetizer plates on the table when the entrees came out, she had to be asked to remove the plates. Disappeared with my drink refill, and overall was not attentive.    The thing about an open kitchen is that I can see my waitress remove dirty plates from another table and then pick up plates (without any hand sanitation) from the kitchen to serve. This really is not okay.  I'm sure the food could be better, but with the servers moving so slow, the prepared food stays longer than it needed to (no warmers) so it comes out luke-warm.  We did speak with the manager who was very understanding and gracious, his response was very appropriate and did help alleviate the disappointment. We may try the restaurant again, I will update the review if I do decide to return."}
{"text":"Service was great very clean had many options for seating inside or outdoors  unbelievable atmosphere the waitress was very good!!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place. I can't stop showing up lol. Pretty addicted. And the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"We went to Babalu to celebrate a friend's birthday.  There were 7 of us and we were seated at a high top right next to the bar.  You think being next to the bar would mean high traffic of our server and also fast access to drinks.  Unfortunately, this was far from the case.   We informed our server of who's birthday it was, and ironically, everyone at the tables got their cocktails except hers.  When asked, (our apps had already come at this point and we were about 35 min in) they said hers would take a little bit longer even though she ordered the same thing as others at the table.  Her drink finally came but the 2nd round of drinks took about another 30 minutes.  Sitting next to the bar, we could see they were busy, but there were 3 people working behind the bar.  When we asked about our round of drinks, our server told us the bar ran out of ticket tape so lost the order (I then saw her run to the portal and put the drink orders in.)  On the plus side, the food was pretty good.  I had a seared tuna salad.  The tuna, although a small portion, tasted fresh.  For our friend's birthday, they brought out a signature dessert and this little sparkler candle that was cool to see.  But what struck me as odd, is the dessert was put on everyone's bill (to split).  The $2 for my share (and one bite) isn't going to break my bank but I've never seen a restaurant charge for a birthday dessert before.  Especially at a table that has already been spending heavy with apps, meals and drinks.    Even though the food was decent, I cant say I'll be hurrying back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I am a huge sucker for service and the people here are wonderful. The food is good and if you don't like something they are more than willing to make it more to your liking.  I feel like service is going down in a lot of places so I really appreciate the attitude here. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The tacos were okay. The ambiance was okay unless you like that rustic atmosphere.  The best thing for me was the burger and the Cuban sandwich which was off the hook!"}
{"text":"I think it's more like 3.5, trending towards 4 stars.  Some things about this new spot are awesome and other things could use some tweaking.  Parking...valet is basically required and the parking lot is a mess.  I was there at lunch and I had to wait at least 10 minutes in line to park.  Brutal.  Service...slow, overwhelmed and not helpful at all.  We felt rushed as lunch was coming to an end and we were brought our check before we had a chance to order dessert or more drinks.   Food...pretty good overall!  I ordered the chopped salad and added grilled chicken.  It was very good and the perfect lunch portion.  We tried the guacamole which was just ok ..sundried tomatoes in guacamole is not ideal.  We ordered a cheese dip but it wasn't creamy, it was stiff and weird but still tasted good!  The tacos my colleagues ordered looked good and they seemed to enjoy them. The broccoli with goat cheese was very good.  The drink menu was decent...the margaritas were good and normal price.  Overall...some areas for improvement but a fun place and pretty awesome menu.  It was loud and vibrant inside so know that going in.  Good for groups."}
{"text":"Good food....tried the pork belly.....red fish....and duck tacos....very good....love it"}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place out and I would say it was different. Don't expect a typical Mexican restaurant. The queso was like eating string cheese, it had good flavor but it definitely wasn't a dip. The margaritas were awesome, and the tapa \"eat it when it's ready\" was a nice way to dine. The food was sub par (aside from the tuna taco and oyster taco!) don't get the duck taco it was super gamey and hard to swallow."}
{"text":"Just checked this place out for lunch and definitely needs some work.  Parking: It is mandatory valet. We showed up to an empty lot and they made us valet, causing a line behind us while we unloaded our family of 6 from the car. On departure, the two valets were racing to park the line of cars arriving, so we had to wait a good 10min before one of them could take our car, even though it was parked right in front of us.  Food: Overall, the food was mediocre. We started off with the guacamole, made tableside. The chips are fantastic but the guacamole was kind of bland (compared to Bakersfield and Cantina). The pico de gallo was fresh, but again needed a little more flavor. For mains, we ordered the fierce shrimp, chicken satay skewers, 4 tacos (fried oyster, blackened red fish, beef tenderloin and duck) and a side of broccolini. The shrimp was flavorful and a good sharing item, but a little on the heavier side. The tacos were VERY disappointing because they were so bland! I also wasn't a fan of the taco shell. I definitely prefer Bakersfield tacos to Babalu's. Out of the four tacos, the oyster had the most flavor. The chicken satay was just OK - nothing memorable. The broccolini was good, but again, nothing too memorable. I told my husband I would return for the chips, and only the chips!  Service: Staff was friendly and attentive while we were there. However, when we called in advance to inquire about reservations, whoever we spoke to was rude and not very helpful.  Ambience: They did a major re-haul from the Cantina days with the open kitchen, white walls and a lot more light coming in. They play old black and white films like the 3 stooges on the walls. I believe they have an outdoor eating space too.  While waiting for car, we talked to another couple also waiting for their car and asked how they liked Babalu's. The response was \"it was just OKAY. I didn't care for the sweet bun on my burger, and my husband wasn't a fan of his food either.\"   Conclusion: Babalu's needs to reassess their food AND the parking situation!"}
{"text":"I've visited Babalu twice now and both times were underwhelming.  The drinks are decent but sweet, watery, and loaded with ice.  They seem overpriced for what you are getting.  The food was okay but nothing special.  The tacos were small and not very filling.  Even with an appetizer and side I left hungry and not satisfied.  The staff seem to be making an effort but it is so chaotic that it is hard to get the server's attention and the right level of service."}
{"text":"I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the service and food at Babalu!  The food is amazing.  We shared the filet on a stick and pan roasted redfish....heaven!!   We added two tacos - one carnita and one atun.  The tuna on the atun was fresh and amazing!     Queso blanco dip started us off - yummmmm!!!  Finished dinner with the cinnamon bread pudding and I think we would have licked the plates if the restaurant was not so full.  I can't finish without saying what a helpful staff they have.  They are so attentive. Our server, Carlos, was  dynamic and was very helpful in picking items from the menu...he knew his stuff.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday with a group of girls. Parking was a nightmare and the noise level inside was insane. The food was pretty good and the service was awesome. They also brought out a ginormous sparkler candle for my friend's birthday!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. They have many choice but the three tacos deal makes a great value meal. I tried that with one of their cocktails and it was just perfect."}
{"text":"I must admit, it wasn't until I saw a line of the menu that gives you info on how to find I Love Lucy episodes online, I totally missed the I Love Lucy reference in the name Babalu. I felt a little silly for not noticing earlier! I loved that when we sat down we were given a small card with our waiter's name on it. Not something you see often but a nice touch.  We started with the table side guac and it was delicious. I've never had sun dried tomatoes in guacamole but they were really tasty. One of my friends ordered the street corn and we all tasted it. Also very good, loved that it was served in a dish rather than on the cob. I had the caesar salad and added grilled salmon. It was the perfect meal for a warm day. Light but filling. The salmon was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  It seems like Babalu has some mixed reviews but it was one of the best meals/experiences I had during my time in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times & know I will be back a lot more. For one the service has always been great, never had a complaint and they all have been super helpful.  I'm usually here for the tacos! Especially for Taco Tuesday when they are $2 (they are also $2 during the week before 6p) I've had everyone and they are all good but my favorite is the Atun because the tuna is seared perfect and the avocado crema & spicy tortilla brings it all together!   Definitely can't go wrong with ordering a margarita my two favs are the Baba-Rita and the Pineapple Margarita. All three of their sangrias are pretty good as well.  I've sat about everywhere in this restaurant and the outside patio is my favorite but there's no bad seat in the place."}
{"text":"This place is 100% basic. Food is under-seasoned and drinks are overly sweet. Prices are average and ambiance is \"farmhouse modern.\"  If you're a basic bitch, you will love it."}
{"text":"Babalu is located in the spot where Cantina 1511 used to be. The parking is a slight pain, because they made us valet in their lot on a Saturday. Maybe that is better for some people.   The restaurant is pretty cool looking on the inside. Definitely a fun/casual environment. The staff is pretty assertive/funny, which isn't a pejorative, it actually made my experience a little but more fun. Just a heads up, though.   We started off with the queso and guacamole, which were both very good. The guacamole was just haphazardly made where I would have to scoop out whole avocados. The queso also had a ton of flavor.   I love margaritas, but theirs were a little bit disappointing. You can actually taste the tequila, but all of their drinks are very sugary.   For dinner I ordered the pork belly tacos, which was really good. The only downside is that they are ~$3 each for a taco about the size of my phone.   Overall it was a good time with some decent food."}
{"text":"I had the burger and some drinks so I will just review those. The burger was awesome. Nothing complicated but everything really came together in a very fresh and flavorful medley. There seems to be a lot of negativity about the interior design in this place but I thought it was fine. I'm not sure what people were expecting... its a taco shop. I parked my own car in the valet spots which I don't think they appreciated, but they didn't make a fuss. I want to go back."}
{"text":"Nice new tapas spot. Simply menu for navigating. A very informed waitstaff that is super helpful. Food comes out rather quickly, guacamole made table side. I ordered a duck, pork belly, and redfish taco and was very satisfied."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight and everything was amazing from the food to the service. We got the filet skewers, shrimp and grits, table side guac, and the ceviche. The decor and atmosphere is welcoming and friendly and we will be sure to come back!"}
{"text":"I was looking for something a little different and stumbled upon Babalu. It was fantastic. I like the Tapa's style because you can try a lot of different things. We ordered a few small plates and some specialty drinks and had a great time. Its a unique place with really good service. I highly recommend. It is also fine to bring your kids here."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for a while now, but was anxious due to the mixed reviews. I Love me some Mexican so... On a Friday night we were able to get a table for 4 at 6:30 a tad early with no problem. Cute restaurant,complementary valet and house Margs on special for 6 bucks. Not too shabby.  Our waitress, Amber, (if I remember correctly) She was great and friendly, even recommended a few items since it was our first time.  Food: Tacos are little, really sure how they get tortillas so small. I ate the grilled shrimp taco and it was delish, I could have eaten 5 more. Colin and I split the shrimp and grits tapas. It almost had a Marsala tasting sauce, gravy. As a table we split the street, (off the cob) corn. We even tried the desert sampler, so so yummy.   My only complaint is I think it's a little pricey for the amount of food. Quality of food and service is great. I'll have to swing by during happy hour or on Taco Tuesday where the tacos are 2 bucks. Not sure which tacos are induced in taco Tuesday. I'm glad I tried this place and I'll be back for some tacos soon especially with there outdoor seating!  On a personal note, I'd now pick this place over Bakersfield if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Got to check out Babalu this weekend on a Saturday evening.  I was already starving so we went early at 5:30 and the place was already almost full.  Lucked out and got a spot out front and we were good to go.  Our server Nerra was super helpful and explained their small plates and what they were all about.  Love the concept of sharing since I'm of the opinion that sharing food makes a meal that much more enjoyable, but they also work with you here if you aren't quite ready to let your dinner buddy reach over and grab some bites.  I started with their seasonal cocktail:  Watermelon Margarita, which was super tasty and the watermelon garnish was SOAKED in tequila... I was a little surprised and had to take a minute, but I recovered and made it through the other watermelon chunks that were included with my drink.  Let's just say I was a couple watermelon bites from taking all my clothes off. ;)  My friend and I were run-gry so we had the tableside guac and chips... The young lady that prepared our guac was super nice and explained all the ingredients that was going into it.  It was okay... but we still had some left over on the table at the end of the meal... We ended up sharing three plates:  short rib over girts, seared tuna, and empanadas.  All of the plates were super tasty and pretty when they arrived.  They actually came really fast... one plate arriving during the table-side guac preparation.  Nerra recommended the bread pudding dessert, and man she was not kidding... well worth it.  Left Babalu stuffed, but wanting to come back to try their tacos.  Not quite a fan of their parking situation here... I did luck out with a front spot, but their complementary valet blocks the back parking lot and the way the front spots are angled, it made for an interesting wait to get out of the parking lot especially after the valet claimed the back lot was full so there was a line of cars that extended out into East Blvd.  Luckily I signaled one car that I was getting ready to leave and I was able to whip the Prius around and maneuver my way out while the car I signaled took my space even before I pulled away.  Since it's a front spot, I'm pretty sure everyone in the restaurant was judging my driving skills... hopefully I got a golden ticket to Hollywood, but either way, I got out without 1) hitting another car or 2) hitting the restaurant structure and last but not least, 3) hitting any hungry restaurant patrons that just wanted to get a delicious meal like the one I just had."}
{"text":"We were treated like royalty.  I went with my daughter and her best friend and got a table across from the chef known as the chef's table.  The chef came and introduced himself and asked if we had any special requests or food allergies.  The waiter Kyle was super nice and friendly.  The manager and assistant manager also at different points came over and spoke to us.  Wow, it was fabulous like no other experience we have had at a restaurant before.  The food was excellent, I ordered the black bean burger with a side of Mexican corn, and both were outstanding.  My daughter and her friend has cheese quesadillas with fries (can't go wrong).  We had cheesecake for dessert which was also wonderful.  Can't wait to go back and take the rest of my family!  The whole atmosphere with the old movie on the wall and the vibrancy of the crowd and especially the way we were treated made for an over the top experience.  We highly recommend Babalu Tapas & Tacos!  A+++"}
{"text":"The pineapple margarita was delicious! The atmosphere was really nice and great customer service! Definitely go back on $2 taco Tuesday to try the veggie tacos."}
{"text":"I loved it!! Lovely interior and the food was amazing. Not sure about all the negative reviews but I thought it was excellent food and service. Can't compare it to Bakersfield, which I've always thought was average at best. We got to try one of their new brunch offerings, tacos with eggs, bacon, crema, potatoes - so yummy!"}
{"text":"Great food! We had the steak tacos, the fried shrimp plate, the cuban sandwich, and a side of fries. Will definitely be back! Our server, Lauren G was wonderful."}
{"text":"This is a bright new addition to the Dilworth neighborhood. I visited here after attending the Festival in the Park event and was greeted by the two valet members. They were offering complimentary valet to their visitors due to the high demand for parking in the area.   The hostess was very pleasant and made sure that we were greeted by name and knew the name of the person seating us... I thought that was pretty dope so I hope they keep that up.   Pros:  - B&W episodes on the projector wall  - Reasonable drink prices  - Ability to open restroom door with foot upon exiting  - Screened windows, so you get a nice breeze without nature landing all over your food - Food arrives hot and fresh (so it may not all arrive at the same time but he wait between items was minimal)   Cons:  - Purse hooks aren't available at every table  (Lol, that's seriously the only con)   I will definitely go back to this place!"}
{"text":"Wow. Visiting a friend in hospital. And wow.  Tuna cervechie and table side guacamole were a great start. The tapas were vast and the filet was recommended and did not disappoint. This place was amazing. I would go back 4 times and try different stuff. The servers were super nice and even said thank you when we left.  If you are in the area I am not certain you could do any better. Yelp comes through again."}
