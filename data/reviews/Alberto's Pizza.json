{"text":"Alberto's Pizza (and Tex-Mex) holds no special place in my heart.  Granted, it's a decent pizzeria in a neighbourhood with few other pizza choices, but its ratio of price to quality sits it comfortably in the realm of mediocrity. I've gone to them once for delivery, once for takeout. They have a very standard-fare takeout deal - a large one-topping pizza for ten bucks. Walking into the place, there's a booth you approach to make your order. When we went, it looked empty - the staff was hiding in the back, not visible until you come right up. The order was made relatively fast, allowing me and the girlfriend to only catch the opening scene of \"Chronicles of Riddick\" playing on their in-store television box. We also took some time to admire their vast array of fake plants - an amusingly high number.  The pizza is light on sauce, which I don't mind, and relatively grease-free, which I don't necessarily see as a plus. Cheese and topping, nothing to write home about. Reminded me of the budget-variety pizza we'd get en masse every week at my school's Pizza Day. I'd recommend it, in general, over the bland-o likes of your Pizza Pizzas, but this city has too many other great pizzerias to really give a hoot about this place.  Also notably funny is that they double as a Tex-Mex place, offering tacos and burritos, proving that the cultures of Italy and Tex-Mexico are not as disparate as your local liberal news media may have you believe.  Taco pizzas for all!"}
{"text":"The pizza tastes fresh and hearty.  A bit pricey, especially compared to the infamous Pizza Pizza chain, but hey, the pizza here doesn't taste like cardboard, which is a plus.  One odd thing is that this place seems to be open erratic and unpredictable hours."}
