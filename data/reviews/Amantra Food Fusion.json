{"text":"We came here for lunch today and had the butter chicken mac and cheese and the buffalo wings. We finished eating and forgot to take pictures! Not to worry. We will take pictures the next time we are back. The food was delicious, the service was friendly and fast and the menu has something for everyone. P.S. You have to try the masala tea!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh and dishes were great. Service not so much but I think it was more due to the fact they're new."}
{"text":"Oh this was fusion alright. A fusion of Indian and dog shit that is. I mean how do you fuck up a chicken kebab? Overmixed and bland, the texture was that of wet bread. You have to buy t naan or rice separately. Highway robbery. The service was not the best appetizer and one persons main dish arrived at the same time and the other persons main dish arrived 10 mins later. There was no check to see if the food was okay. Worst Indian restaurant and honestly one of the worst restaurants ive ever been to food wise. DO NOT GO HERE. Plenty of other options on this street."}
{"text":"Ok so this is basically a good place to take someone who's never tried Indian food before. The fusion will make it easier for them to acclimate their tastebuds lol. Honestly the chicken is tender and very good quality. We ordered the Butter Chicken Burger, chaat, Trio of Chicken, Amantra's spicy chicken burger and butter chicken flatbread with a bed of jeera rice. For dessert we got gulab jamun and rasmalai. The gulab jamun is amazing! The price point is high for the quantity you get but again, this isn't a place you would go on the daily, rather a good place to introduce Indian cuisine to someone."}
{"text":"We were visiting Mississauga and tried this restaurant. Everything was great, loved the food, great service. Our kids are not big Indian food fan but fusion part made it easy for them to try everything we ordered. Food is a good mix of western and Indian food. Different and interesting. Definitely coming back on our next visit to North."}
{"text":"Wife and I had the Lamb Vindaloo, Chana masala, basmati rice along with the veggie pakora and samosa. All of it was great. The perfect amount of spice for us. The staff was great. Nice touch to give the option of cold or room temperature water. Who does that?  Service was awesome and attentive. My only detracting if I had to have one. 5 tv's and they were all on. Doesn't for the atmosphere at all. Maybe not put on the best of UFC fights. Lol. All in all a great experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"I do not know how service and the ambiance is inside as this rating is solely based on the food quality and for that reason alone there will never be a second chance for this place! Too many good places out there! Ordered uber eats and yes the food was pipping hot ! Well the big bowl of sauce with 4 pieces  of RAW breast( small cubes lost at the bottom of that mess of a sauce!  I couldn't even eat it it was oily and unappetizing! The butter naan was burned on the outside and chewy like a rubber band inside! Please see pictures so you don't think i'm crazy!"}
{"text":"We brought our cousin that was visiting from US. We ordered the sweet chili fries, fries chaat and trio of chicken as apps. Hubby and cousin loved the chicken and fries were enjoyed by all. Suggest to serve onions with the chicken. For dinner I had a gf dairy free spinach quesadilla. Spicy and kind of dry but I did not want a heavier meal. Cousin and hubby shared the palak paneer, lamb and plain naan and garlic naan. They loved the food but found the naan dry. The server said they use a tandoor but maybe they need to add more butter. For dessert they had the paan kulfi and loved it. I suggest they make it with coconut milk as they make it in house.....then I could have it next timeStaff were friendly and helpful.   We were at the Streetsville Christmas market and Amantra had some food set up outside that could be purchased. A meal of 2 items and rice was $9.99. I ordered the channa masala and dal makhani to go as it was starting to rain. By the time I got to the car, the dal had come out of the container into the bag. At home I transferred it to a plate and warmed it up in the microwave. It was on the spicy side but was not bad. We had eaten in the restaurant in the past and that was a better experience. My kids and I love their fusion fries (chaat fries and sweet chili fries). We all thought their main dishes (butter chicken and channa, were just average. The staff are very nice and informative and I hope they do well in this location.....they just need to make their main dishes as good as their apps."}
{"text":"Found this gem and we loved it so much we went back a second time while on vacation.   We tried the butter chicken poutine at the suggestion of the staff and it was delicious ! We additionally ordered the Chole masala with naan   Our second visit we tried the amantra chaat and the chicken masala quesadilla. Both were fantastic.  TIP: Go in a group and plan to eat family style so you can try more items on the menu. There were many items I wanted to try, and only so many things we could eat in the two times we visited."}
{"text":"We ordered from here off of Uber Eats a few weeks ago. We got the vegetable biryani, chickpea salad, and the herb crusted paneer tikka. This won't be a harsh review because it was delivery and food just doesn't taste as good after travelling as it does fresh in the restaurant. Nonetheless, everything was flavoured really well! The paneer was amazing and I can't wait to try it in house to see if it gets even better. The biryani was a little dry, but the flavours were very well developed and with the raita, it was great. And the chick pea salad, because of being packed in the Styrofoam, had released a lot of liquid, but once we mixed it a ton, it managed to come together. Once again, the flavour was amazing.  I definitely recommend this place if you're craving quick indian that's not so heavy."}
{"text":"Third time back! Ate way too much food and feel sick now, but I honestly think it was worth it! Had the vegetarian Indian tacos (again!) and the crispy buffalo cauliflower to start! Only complaint was that the service was weird... as in our server was nice, but strange. I asked for a glass of wine, she asked to see my I.D., to which I obviously obliged. Then, however, she looked at it for over a minute, looked at me and said \"So... you're underage?\" When I am 19 years old... as it says on my license! Great food - but maybe train staff a little more on checking I.D.s?"}
{"text":"Outstanding hidden gem in Streetsville. The samosas were crispy on the outside and delicious.  We also had the Butter Chicken, Tikka Masala and Biryani. The flavours were complex and perfectly prepared. Try the Fries Chaat. Yummy!"}
