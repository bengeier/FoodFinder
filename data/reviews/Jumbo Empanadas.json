{"text":"Big thumbs up. Their cheese empanadas are to die for. We served them with refried beans and chili sauce - amazing."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has such great reviews. We ate there last night for the first ( and possibly the last) time and it was underwhelming and greasy. It could have been a bad day - they were really crowded because of the winter solstice celebrations but I don't know if I want to go back and verify this. 
It was super cheap though.
We had the vegetarian empanadas. There was a minuscule bowl of salsa accompanying it. 
We've had much better luck with other South American restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Having the Jumbo Beef Empanada and a Chilean Salad is probably one of my all-time favorite meals--it's always fresh, a great amount of food, and super satisfying. That the meal is less than $10 is astounding to me. Honestly, I hope nothing ever happens to this place."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! It's in the middle of Kensington market. They sell empanadas (beef, chicken, veggie, cheese), corn pies (with both beef and chicken), humitas (kinda like tamales), and other Chilean specialties. It's super cheap and the staff are very friendly. I always eat there and get take out for the next few days. The chicken empanadas and the corn pie are my favorite."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place I ate on my recent vacation to Toronto.  Found out about this place through yelp (thanks guys).  Full disclosure: I can't remember ever eating empanadas before going to this restaurant, but they tasted amazing here.  I tried the meat, veggie, and cheese empanadas and they were all great.  The shape of each empanada was determined by the filling it had which was fun.  The owner and her staff were really friendly and put up with all my annoying questions.  You know, questions like, \"what's in that?\", \"how many of those would make a full meal?\": basically the questions a silly inexperienced empanada eater would ask.  In sum, I really enjoyed my experience at Jumbo Empanadas and I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best empanadas hands down. Beef, Chicken, cheese= all very very delicious and filling. Love their salsa. 

I prefer it over the other empanadas in Kensington market because the empanadas here don't taste 'fried'. In fact they taste very healthy  and make a filling dinner. 

I've gotten cold empanadas for take out multiple times to be heated at home at 400 degrees F for 4 minutes and they always come out great!"}
{"text":"Fantastic empanadas, they are delicious little bundle of joy. Would recommend getting the mini chicken and beef."}
{"text":"Giant pockets of delicious dough filled with luscious ground beef, egg and roasted onions?  Um, yes please!  

Empanadas from Jumbo are not to be missed.  I tried the beef and the vegetarian, which was mostly mushrooms and spinach. But if you go, whatever you do, GET THE CHILEAN SALAD!!  Seriously, I could have put my face in this yummy goodness.  It's lettuce, tomatoes, onions, broccoli, avocado, and a cilantro and fresh basil dressing that is so good, I was practically rendered speechless.  

The owner was there chatting with the patrons, and I found the staff to be accommodating and helpful.  There's ample seating inside, even though it's a tiny building, and the patio was hopping, minus the swarms of killer bees that are currently inhabiting Toronto.

They accept debit cards and cash."}
{"text":"Jumbo was Yum-mo!

My boyfriend has been meaning to bring me here for the longest time because he knows I enjoy trying new foods. Upon walking in, you can really feel the heat of the ovens in this little place, I can't imagine working here in the summer! It's just a little place but there is a patio outside which I hope to enjoy soon.

We had a beef empanada, cheese empanada, and a corn pie. The empanada were not bad, what I really really reallly enjoyed was the corn pie! It's basically a Shepherd's pie but instead of mashed potato it's mashed corn. There were so many little treasures in both the corn pie and the beef empanadas (i.e. raisins, hard boiled egg, chicken, and olives). To top it all off, there's a mini side dish of fresh salsa! I wish they gave bigger portions of it. I can't wait to come again and feast on a corn pie!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here is delicious. I am always flabbergasted by its tastiness as it seems to keep improving by the second & with each ravenous mouthful. Consistent, undeniably exceptional quality home cookin.' I've been here quite often with my boyfriend. He took me here on our first date back in Saturday, October 26, 2013 & I was hooked. 

So far, I've tried the Beef Empanadas, shredded Chicken Empanadas (kind of dry, but still good), Humitas, Corn Pie, Sopaipillas & Manjar/Dulce de Leche-filled pastries. All of the above I've tried at least twice & are very reasonably-priced, spectacular & worth the splurge! 

If I go on some crazy detox diet, I think I will end up breaking down their doors first thing. Also, their Chancho en Piedra (Chilean Salsa) is especially good & complements the cuisine flawlessly. I think they should bottle it up & sell it! 

Cannot say enough good things about this place. Now I know why food is a drug & addiction to it is a very real & fatal possibility. I've been to restaurants that are 10x more hyped up/expensive-- and went home digestively distressed & eternally regretful for having spent so much dime on paltry idiotic portions of mediocrity in comparison. To this day, boyfriend & I are still going back for more divine gluttony! Very highly recommended!"}
{"text":"After spending some time in South America, I find myself occasionally craving an Empanada here in Toronto.  Jumbo Empanada is 100% authentic--properly spiced, with full olives and a hard boiled egg inside.  My Chilean friend raves about this place, so it must be good!

For lunch I get the beef Empanada, and if I'm really hungry I'll grab a cheese one on the side.  There are some interesting choices for sodas here too, the perfect accompaniment.

If you crave a Chilean Empanada in Toronto, this is *the* place to go!"}
{"text":"Hard to pass this place by...the beef empanadas call my name.  Can't forget the tasty salsa and mega salad.  At one time or another, tried all the varieties.  The veggie was deceiving at fist glance...very high and puffy but mainly full of air and lacked substance for me.  The cheese was cheesy but fried...a bit too oily for my tastes.  The chicken didn't have the same zing as the beef but would be my second option.  It can get quite busy during peak hours but less so later in the afternoon/evening.  Try it during lunch on a weekend and you'll likely be waiting a while.  The owner/staff are friendly and handle the rush the best they can...kudos, especially in the heat of summer...inside can get quite humid/hot.  Now, does anyone care to share the salsa recipe?! :P"}
{"text":"19 reviews and only one person tried something other than the Empanadas here? I'm disappointed in you Yelpers. Maybe it's my fault for being the kind of guy that visits Jerusalem and doesn't go to the Sexateria, but 1 out of 19? Sigh... 

The empanadas were very tasty but small for the kind of hunger my friend's and I were brewing. We had two corn pies and one veggie empanada for three people and proceeded to inhale our food. 

I had never heard of corn pie before or the Inca Gold drink I had with it but both were fantastic. Inca Gold is sort of a cross between pineapple juice and cream soda, but better. I haven't had many drinks with more sugar though. My teeth hurt a bit after ward. 

Corn pie is similar to Shepard's pie in that they both have a solid layer of mashed vegetable on top and meaty goodness hidden underneath. Unlike Shepard's pie (unless you're some type of heathen and put weird stuff in it) Corn pie has a corn topping, black olives, ground beef, pulled chicken, the biggest raisins I've ever seen and a hard boiled egg cut in two. It was really one of the nicest, least fussy meals I've ever had.

If you check out JE, do have an empanada but if you don't try something else on the menu you're doing yourself a disservice. I just felt that the other dishes on the menu were under represented and deserved a voice."}
{"text":"Best Chilean Empanadas in the city . Baked and fresh to serve . They have great pastel del Choclo as well ."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  The cheese empanadas are out of this world.  It's a must when I got to Kensington, even if I am full.  I have to get these bad boys.  The salsa is sooooooo good.  I always get extra to eat on its own.  It's so good!  I must when you visit Kensington."}
{"text":"Just a word of friendly advice: you may develop a craving for these empanadas, so try at your own risk! The beef empanadas are perfection, flavorful with a good portion for the price (although if you're not a fan of olives or raisins like myself, you can just pick them out), and the salsa, like others have stated, is divine. I would recommend the corn pie, but ideally it should be shared between 4-5 people, not just because of the size but because of its sweetness. 

Only downside: very limited seating with tiny tables, so it's probably not a good idea to go during prime lunch or dinner time."}
{"text":"Muy bueno!!!
Oddly enough I woke up last week with a fierce craving for an Empanada (my dad used to make them for me when I was little). I started researching where to find the best ones in Toronto and came across these great reviews for Jumbo Empanada.

I arrived there mid-afternoon and the line-up was to the door way...this was my first clue that I was in for a treat! By some miracle my friend and I were able to get a seat on the patio. Our empanadas came up super-quick and the staff was super friendly!

I am going to tell you right now that this was hands down THE BEST $3.99 that I have ever spent. The egg, roasted onions, olive, ground beef and cheesy goodness packed inside of the doughy yumminess that was my beef and cheese empanada was beyond delicious.  Also, the homemade salsa was so fresh and delicious that I had to purchase my own for home. I am sorry dad but I want Jumbo Empanada to adopt me now...

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Chilean food, the empanadas are really good, the beef and chicken ones are nice and big, the cheese ones are smaller, but that's what I'm use to anyways. The salsa is very spicy so be warned! I also tried the 'corn pie', or pastel de choclo as we call it, and it was good, tasted just like my grandmothers did. They also serve little caramel cakes and salad, as well as humitas.

My partner and I frequently visit this restaurant, it's super busy on weekends, but during the week it's quiet! Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"My hubby and I love the empanadas from this place. For about $5 you get a hugeeee empanada stuffed with meat. I have tried and love all of them. The filling is flavorful and moist, the dough outside is a perfect thickness and has a slight chewiness to it which I like. I really like the fresh salsa that comes with the empandas, adds a nice acidity component to the dish. It is a no frills place, so don't expect premium service."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and such a cultured ambience. The chicken empanada ($4.50) is huge and mediocre but paired with the salsa... amazing! The cheese empanada ($2) is also a must try. Definitely going for the beef empanada next time! Cheap eats and worth it!"}
{"text":"Their food is good, but nothing spectacular. I don't know what the hype is about. We had the beef empanadas but they weren't any different or special than anywhere else. 
Not really something Id go out of my way for"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for empanadas. Great beef empanadas, and just can't get enough of their zesty salsa! I've tried the chicken and cheese empanadas, which are also good, but the beef ones are my fave. What's also great is the reliable consistency of the flavours. Never disappoints!

One other thing I'd recommend for those who have a sweet tooth is the humongous dulce de leche cookies on their counter. I just had to ask the nice lady at the cash what they were called. She said it several times, but my untrained ears just couldn't follow how she was pronouncing it, so I'm sticking to calling them dulce de leche cookies.

I'd like to see AC installed in this place. It's bad enough for the customers in the summertime, but I also feel bad for the bakers who are in front of those ovens all day long."}
{"text":"Loved the Beef Empanadas that we ordered! The empanadas were massive, stuffed with ground beef and a half boiled egg and were a good value at $4.50! The place also looks quaint and homely! Go check it out!"}
{"text":"I am the first to admit that when it comes to Latin American food, especially South American, I am as picky and demanding as they come. I grew up eating the stuff, empanadas were to me what peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are to most kids. Its hard for me to find an empanada here in Toronto that impresses me, specially since my grandma's and sister empanadas are so delicious! 

Jumbo Empanadas is a small, dark and boiling hot restaurant offering three items: Empanadas (chicken,beef,veggie or cheese), Humitas, and Pastel de Choclo (Savoury Corn Pie). I came here with my mom totally famished and looking forward to some comfort food. 

To start, this place is crazy busy. The line to place your order is pretty long, and it doesn't move particularly fast. Once you get to the front of the line, you will be greeted by what is possibly the crankiest and most antisocial, too cool for school girl I have ever seen. This chick is totally pms'ing hard core. Anywho, I placed my order of one corn pie, one humita, and 1 beef empanada. I then went to sit and wait for my food to be warmed up and brought to me. About 5 minutes later the same sour faced girl came out and dumped our food on the table without a word. Whatever, I came here for the food. 

Now, the food... The humita was seriously horrendous. Humitas are made of fresh grated corn, mixed with fresh cheese and cilantro (optional) wrapped in corn husks and steamed or baked to a perfectly coagulated and doughy consistency. If made correctly, humitas can be addicting and delicious. This however was not the case at Jumbo's. Yuck, that's all I can say. We had one bite and left the rest. Totally tasteless and undercooked. My mom (the humita queen) should go and give the cook a few tips. 

The pastel de choclo was equally disappointing. Not as bad as the humitas, but equally bland and devoid of seasoning. When corn pie is made correctly it is sweet, salty, and smoky all at the same time. This pie was none of these things. It was one dimensional and boring. It is filling though, and I guess it is good if you don't know any better. However, I've had the real thing, and this just wasn't up to snuff. 

Now, the Empanadas. These were good. The filling is traditional (black olive and boiled egg included). These reminded me of my last trip to Chile and all the empanadas I wolfed down. Yummmm! The empanada was so good that I lined up again and got 4 more beef and 4 cheese to go. Hey, if something is good, you better stock up! Plus, these are great for breakfast. 

I'll definitely be getting more empanadas from here, however I won't ever be eating either the corn pie or humitas again. Next time I have a craving for an humita I'll just wait for my mom's yearly gigantic humita bake off."}
{"text":"Jumbo Empanadas is one of few places I often come back. I tried many different places, but there are only a few places I always come back. I like their beef empanadas, which mixed with eggs. Sizes are big and it is only $5 or $6. Inside the restaurant, there are decoration from South America and they have Chilean TV show. I often take out, but I can dine comfortably there. Even one person can dine fine. I love Jumbo Empanadas."}
{"text":"Authentic Chilean style empanadas café located in Kensington market. Small outdoor seating area and a few indoor seating area was packed when we visited. 
A lot of people order empanadas to go. Their empanadas are big and delicious. They offer beef and chicken empanadas, salads and mini empanadas. My husband loves beef ones and we got a few to go. 
They are somewhat short handed when it's busy, you might have to wait for a while to get your order. But it's all worth the wait. 
Owner is from chile, and is very friendly."}
{"text":"I was trying to settle who has the best empanadas in town and it was down to this place and El Almacen.

This place is a pretty neat shop in Kensington serving up Chilean empanadas where El Almacen serves up Argentinian ones.  When you go in there is a menu on the left side and you can see racks of empanadas!  They're about 3 times larger than El Alamacen's empanadas.  I ordered a beef one and of course a cheese empanada.

The cheese empanada is awesome.  The skin is golden and crispy and the cheese inside is solid.  It's a small empanada and not like their beef empanada.  It's about 1/3 the size of the beef one.

I cut into the beef empanada and had a forkful.  The inside is DELICIOUS and filled with beef, eggs and some raisins!  I really liked it.  I tried cutting into more of the crust a bit and as much as I liked the crust it was definitely thick and made it slightly dry in certain areas.  As much as I like the empanada I have to say that prefer El Almacen.  I also had it about 30 minutes previous to coming here so that I had a good taste in my mouth for comparison.  

Does anyone know if they make the meat filled empanadas with the cheese empanada pastry?"}
{"text":"Some of the BEST empanada's that have ever graced my mouth. Also, the salsa is to die for. Every time I am there I debate whether I should buy a large container of salsa to eat with a spoon until I die of happiness."}
{"text":"Cheap and quick eats. Worth the value. Friendly staff and interesting ornaments on the wall."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try Chilean empanadas in Canada for some time, having had some when I was down in Chile.  I have had empanadas from other countries, and Chilean is my favourite, with generous sizes and meaty flavours.

I like Jumbo Empanada's good choice of fillings, with ingredients like hard boiled eggs, and olives in their meat empanadas.  You get your meal size empanadas ($4.50) or you can opt to get smaller snack size ones.  I got some snack sized cheese empanadas as well, which are more filling than their size suggests; you wont' go hungry as even two snack sized ones should be more than enough for a meal.

The clientele seem to be very loyal as well, with the Kensington neighbourhood well represented at the tables.  I would definitely come here for more take out empanadas in the future."}
{"text":"I've got to be one of the longest term customers here. Discovered Empanadas in 2002 before I even lived in Canada. I am an aficionado of all things South/Central American. So, the empanada's here are Chilean style, different than I first expected. It's still not my preferred style because the vegetarian options are either deep-fried cheese or spinach and mushroom. I need some variety, so I started getting the broccoli and avocado salad. Spunky! 
They've got flavour, and spice. See if it is your style."}
{"text":"5 Stars no question.  This place does a few dishes and they do them to perfection.  Do you want an amazing chicken empanada with the perfect salsa to garnish it?  Then go here.  

Best order if you are new to empanadas or Chilean food:  \"Can I have one chicken and one cheese empanada please\"  The salsa comes with it so make sure you get that as well.  Friendly staff - can get pretty busy, but takeout is always a great option - not hard to just pop them in the toaster oven.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stumble upon this place, when my best friend was visiting.  I always wanted to try empanadas, and never had the opportunity to do so. Must say, this place was delicious! Had the beef, chicken, and cheese empanada & humitas ( kinda resembles joong - which is a sticky rice wrapped in bamboo leaf - but this was with corn instead).  

The humitas, I was kinda disappointed because I grew up with joong. As a result, anything that resembles a joong, I automatically associate it to sticky rice.  Definitely is just as good but this is for anyone who is looking for a healthier option (I must include I am bias because I don't like veggies what so ever). 

I liked the beef & the cheese one the most! Probably because I LOVE cheese, and I felt like they use the queso fresco cheese for this dish, which is one of my favourite cheese ever! 

Overall, this place has made me a fan of empanadas! 

I even walked from work to grab some for my coworkers to try! 

The homemade salsa that goes with the empanadas is truly to die for! 

Highly recommend this place, if you are looking for a snack!"}
{"text":"This tiny restaurant delivers the goods! It's quaint, and makes you feel as though you were transported to a seaside town in Chili with the kitsch and personality. I can imagine this is what would serve as a diner in Chili. Comfort food. What makes it even better is that they are licensed and have Amersterdam lager on tap as well as some Chilean wine. The salad is incredible! It looks typical, lettuce topped with avocado... but one bite will tell you that it's not the veggies that will make your taste buds take notice as much as the dressing. The corn pies are tasty as well as the empanadas. Since everything is made with the same basic ingredients either you will like the food here, or your taste lies elsewhere. Prices are reasonable and there is an elevated patio out front overlooking Augusta making this a market destination for many great reasons."}
{"text":"Very cozy and friendly atmosphere. And authentic empanadas!

I had chicken empanadas which has black olive and boiled egg inside. So yum and cheap!"}
{"text":"Got the corn pie as other other helpers have recommended..very mediocre. Did not like that the centre was like warm, only the outer was hot."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie, before I hit up JE in Kensington Market last night I had already completed a fair amount of research on the joint. A minute into my online recon, it became quite apparent that I was not going to find a negative review on JE, only individuals boasting about the solid nada.
 
The owner, Irene Morales, moved to Toronto from Chile way back in the day and used to bake empanadas for the Chilean community as a part-time gig. They became in such high demand that she subsequently purchased a hot dog cart and began to sell them out of the cart on Augusta St. now full-time. With the continued success of her pockets of love demand rose and she was able to purchase the venue she currently operates out of. 

When I had first arrived I sat out on the patio which could seat up to 20 people. To order you run up the stairs to the actual storefront where you fill find a couple tables look over the patio and another couple inside. Over all the venue is very small but clearly a high turnover demon. In fact as we were ordering and eating there were constantly people coming in and out getting empanadas to go. 

You may be asking yourself, what the hell is an empanada? What is so good about one? Well, Irene's delicious empanadas are a perfect pocket pastry stuffed with meat and a medley of olives, raisins, onions and I even found a hard boiled egg in mine! I tried both the chicken, beef, and cheese empanadas. Although the chicken was moist and seasoned well the beef definitely took the cake, it was spiced to perfection and I could have eaten 3 and subsequently taken a nap. The cheese empanadas are minis and I highly recommend getting at least one to accompany your sizeable empanada. They are pre-made and take approximately 3-4 minutes to bake.  

With each empanada comes this holy homemade salsa screaming citrus and spice. It's the type of salsa that makes you want to learn how to make salsa.. properly. It's served in a small clay dish and by the end of the meal I was licking every last drop that I could from the little bowl, it was that good. In fact right now I'm hard fiending an empanada, it will definitely be on my to do list for this weekend. If you find yourself in Kensington or not, do it."}
{"text":"Didn't love the empanadas. Wish they had Argentinian style empanadas (which are out of this world). Have also tried empanadas when in Santiago, Chile and these don't really come close."}
{"text":"For under $5 you can fill up on a good sized chicken empanada and a soda. This is one of my top three restaurants in Toronto- amazingly delicious, homemade, spicy and tender. I love empanadas!
Well, I love jumbo empanadas. 
:)"}
{"text":"5 stars!!  I didn't realize that a lot of the eateries in this area close at 8pm so my friends and I were trying to find a place to eat before heading back to our hotel.  We arrived after closing time, but the cashier was nice enough to serve us!  I am glad she did because I was so hungry!  She was so nice to us.  We were having trouble distinguishing the coins and she was happy to help us sort through the currency (unlike the sourpuss Chinese lady at a bakery over in Chinatown).  I ran a family coffee place for a while so I really appreciate good service.

Now onto the empanadas!  I've only ever had Filipino empanadas which are meaty but have a sweetness to it.  I ordered the jumbo veggie empanada and it was fantastic!  I'm not a complete vegetarian but I would say that 70-80% of my meals are meatless so I was happy to see an option for me.  The veggie empanada was filled with mushrooms, spinach, and a bunch of other stuff.  All very delicious!  The crust was great and very chewy.  My friends ordered the beef and chicken empandas and they were both very happy with their choices.  I really regret not ordering a mini beef since it seems quite popular among reviewers.

As for the salsa, very fresh and spicy!  My friend gave me hers so I actually used two servings for mine.  I love spicy food so I'm not sure if everyone would like the level of spiciness.  I will definitely make my way back here if I ever travel to Toronto again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my jumbo beef empanada.  It also comes with a side of salsa which tasted pretty good.  It was served hot and fresh and wasn't sitting in a warmer.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome. Joe dee took me here, for great justice."}
{"text":"By far the best chilena Empenada I have had including south america.

Notice the size has shrunk recently and quality is not the same but worth a visit. We Like the Chicken, Beef and cheese."}
{"text":"Tried the corn pie here... twice.

Think of a shepperds pie with sweet corn mixed into the potato mash that is normally on top.  It's a unique, rich blend of sweet and salty and if you have an appetite, you'll be very tempted to eat the whole thing."}
{"text":"That Umbrella Guy @ Jumbo Empanadas.

Came in around 7 PM on a Monday night. Compared to some other places in kensington, this place isn't too small, with seating for maybe a dozen or so. Lots of decor, with some spanish show playing on TV in the corner. 

The washrooms here require key access, and the key is only given to dine-in customers. The person tending the cash called out when I went downstairs and informed me that a key was required, which is pretty nice. There's a very escape-room feel to the basement, with doors that say \"DO NOT ENTER\" and arrows leading you to the end of the corridor where the washrooms are. Pretty low-lighting as well, so it's really got the game atmosphere going. Hope you're ok with the dark.

Prior to entering, I saw the pictures of the empanadas on yelp and was impressed by the size of it, but unfortunately that's about the only thing that impressed me in the end. When I asked about the empanadas, the staff pointed to some racks carrying meat empanadas, opened a fridge or something up and showed us the cheese empanadas, and then opened another fridge with all the corn pies.

We ordered a chicken empanada, a vegetable empanada, and a corn pie. After asking whether we wanted sauce on the side or not, she then proceeded to toss them into an oven and served it after a few minutes. She brought over some cutlery as well.

The empanadas were quite tough to chew and also quite doughy. Felt like they had been sitting around for awhile. I was kind of expecting something chewier, flakier, hotter, juicer. 

The chicken empanada came with some pulled chicken, a couple olives, and half a hard-boiled egg. But it was very bland and very dry: The chicken was pretty tasteless. Overall, I wasn't sure what I was eating. I would prefer if it had hot juices inside with a thinner wrap, but I don't know much about empanadas so maybe this is just how they are.

The vegetable empanada wasn't that much better either. It came with preserved vegetables, chopped mushrooms, a few olives, and carrot strips. It did have more flavour than the chicken version, but I didn't like the flavours. Not sure if it was the mushrooms that didn't work out for me.

The corn pie was a bit better than the empanadas. Definitely had more meat than the chicken empanada and had more flavours that I would expect of beef. There was a lot of corn on top, and a lot of minced meat on the bottom, but it was pretty average to me. Wouldn't try it again.

It's definitely a jumbo empanada, but the texture and the flavours didn't do it for me. Is it because I came in the evening?

On the bright side, I did enjoy the Soursop nectar that they had in the fridge. Service was also good. But I value food over atmosphere and service and unfortunately the food didn't meet my expectations."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken and cheese empanadas. The cheese one was about half the size of the chicken. The cheese filling was tasty, but I wish there was more filling inside. The chicken empanada had a flaky crust and a nice creamy filling. This is a great snack spot if you're craving empanadas while walking around Kensington!"}
{"text":"I'd heard much about this place. I think it's probably fair to Jumbo Empanadas to say I made an error in choosing a vegetable Empanada as opposed to a meat one. Had I been a hardcore vegetarian, I expect I'd have really enjoyed the empanada I was given. It was filled with mushrooms, spinach (I think) and other vege delights. The crust was nice, with a crisp bite. I was given the option of taking it away as it was (cooled) or having it heated up. I went for heated up but was good to know for future reference that I can get it to go and heat it up for dinner or whatever. 
Service was fine. They were busy but efficient and friendly.

I know I really ought to have gone for a beef empanada. And I shall, next time I visit. Jumbo Empanadas, I look forward to returning and sticking to what I know and love."}
{"text":"Holy hell.
My eyes were much hungrier then my stomach since I ordered a beef AND cheese empanada - but it was well worth it.  I devoured them all and I suggest that anyone who is in the market do the same.  It's a small place, boiling hot, but the food (and the fresh salsa on the side) makes up for it. I can't wait for summer to come around again, because they have a nice patio perfect for people watching.

Please go to this place and try it out. Seriously. The food is quick, savory and made with love."}
{"text":"The quaint and small Jumbo Empanadas restaurant serves up delicious and, you guessed it, JUMBO Chilean empanadas. These were probably the cleanest, non-greasiest empanadas I've had."}
{"text":"Enjoyed one of the jumbo beef empanadas from here on their patio, and it was lovely. The lady behind the counter was pleasant, the empanada was only $4.50, and there's a patio!!

Tasted some pineapple, olive, and raisins in the empanadas. Great medley of flavours, I would totally come back to try the other items.

I saw someone else had ordered the corn pie, and the portion looked huuuuge. I think the corn pie is less than $4. Also saw someone eating the vegetable empanada, which looked impressive as well."}
{"text":"This place is small inside, maybe enough seating for about 15 or so.  I was with a friend and I ordered 2 empanadas (one chicken and on cheese) and we split them.  The chicken was 4.50 and the cheese was 2 bucks.

The girl brought the food to our table but the cutlery was at the front which we had to get ourselves.  

The meat filled empanada was larger and very doughy especially at the corner where it was folded.  The cheese one was smaller and thinner and appeared to be fried.

Both were ok but honestly I wasn't blown away by them.  I like the place inside of Bathurst station better that has samosas as well as empanadas.  

To me this place is just OK.  There are several places in Kensington that seem to serve the same kind of food whether it's this type of thing or Mexican.  I can't say this place is great enough for me to want to return."}
{"text":"This place is alright. My mission for the day is to try out 2 empanada places in Kensington. Since Jumbo has positive reviews, I had to try it. I tried Segovia first, which was just right across the street. I got a Humita. Then I went to Jumbo's to get a vegetarian. Frankly, I like Segovia's more but both were delicious.

Jumbo's empanadas are indeed massive, but not as big as it looks. Mine was mostly air, puffed out during baking. It had the same portion of stuffing inside as Segovia's. The difference is that Jumbo's is $4.5 and Segovia's was $3.33, both pretax. So if I come again, I'll probably choose Segovia's. 

Of course, it's not quite apples to oranges. Segovia doesn't have tables. If you want a place to sit, it's got to be Jumbo. I came on a Saturday and had to wait a bit even for take out. This place is indeed popular."}
{"text":"Very nice chicken empanadas, hot salsa amazing.  Inexpensive.  Super-nice people serving at the counter."}
{"text":"Never had an empanada before. The beef one I had at Jumbo Empandas hit the spot-savory ground beef mixed in with chunks of onion, egg, raisins (ooh!) and olives kinda of a mixed bag of goodies in a doughy shell. The salsa was terrifically tangy and spicy, a good condiment if only they could give a little more with each portion! I also had the salad cuz I was hungry and it is a big portion with big slices of avocado and some tomato. Inside is not much to look at, but the staff are friendly here and you can be in and out in a pinch for less than $10."}
{"text":"The staff were very friendly however I was not impressed with the beef empanada.  Why are there raisins in them?  In addition the beef had an odd taste.  The salsa was good but small."}
{"text":"So flavorful, succulent  and delicious. We tried to return later that night with additional friends but it was closed. A must stop our next time in Toronto."}
{"text":"Just like the name implies, they serve big empanadas. Like a calzone, it's a portable baked savoury turnover. I had the chorizo empanada which tasted like spiced ground pork. It was unique though, had a few olives, hard boiled egg and raisins. The combination was different and tasty. For 3.99, it was well worth it. The salsa on the side made each bite even better, make sure to dip away!"}
{"text":"I love this place. 

I've been coming here for almost 13 years. 

I really enjoy their beef and cheese empanadas. Their spicy salsa is a great compliment!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! had a chicken empanada w a side of salsa. Cost me 6.22$ and I was full after. Empanada is a very healthy size and everything about it from the dough to all the insides was absolutely delicious. It is baked which I really appreciated. Dough is crunchy and tastes amazing, almost like a pretzel. Chicken filling was moist and juicy and so flavorful, salsa had great fresh flavour and a nice kick. 

I had never had empanadas before today but I will most definitely be back. Cannot beat the value and quality this place offers. You can tell everything is made with care and fresh ingredients. I am a fan."}
{"text":"Exactly what you're expecting. 

Massive empanadas (chicken, beef, veggie) for a great price. Chicken is my favourite. They've got whole olives (pitted) and a hard boiled egg inside. You also get a little case of salsa on the side. 

The mini cheese empanadas are also great too. 

They have other items on the menu but sadly I've yet to try them. 

Cute place though. Have been a number of times and will be back again. Great for a snack"}
{"text":"The best cheese empanada and salsa in the city. Though, not a big fan of the meat empanada's. They just don't do it for me. So, I always just settle for the gooey, melt in your mouth cheese empanada's with a good helping of their very, very flavorful and spicy salsa....hmmm yum."}
{"text":"A family-friendly, homey, inviting atmosphere, but in our opinion, the empanadas are only so-so. Located on Augusta Avenue just north of Baldwin Street, this isn't a big spot in terms of space. But the environment is very welcoming, service is friendly, and lucky for us, on the Friday night we visited, we found a table right away.

We walked up and ordered one chicken empanada to try, and within 5 minutes, a server brought it to our table. Overall, in taste it was very average, in size it was massive! The empanada was basically the size of my face! Jumbo? I'll say.

However, although there was a generous amount of meat in the pastry, the chicken could have used a lot more seasoning and flavour. It was a bit bland as we continued to bite into it and the pastry wasn't crispy enough for my liking (like a reviewer says below, it tasted like it was frozen and just re-heated). We ended up dousing the bites with spoonfuls of the salsa it came with, to give it the kick it needed, but even then, it ended up being just 'okay.'

Overall, there are better spots in the area (and in the GTA) for empanadas which, in my opinion, are even tastier. For one chicken empanada, with tax, we paid a little over $5.00."}
{"text":"Love to stop here for a snack when I'm in the Kensington Market. The chicken and beef empanadas are always fresh, warm and stuffed with tasty filling. And when I don't feel like eating meat, I go for the cheese empanada or the humitas which are equally as satisfying. My favorite part is the salsa they give with the empanadas. Soooooo good."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, its more of a quick bite type of place instead of a sit down restaurant though. The dining area is pretty small and its right across the street from another empanada place. I got the chicken one and it was flavourful and I didn't expect all the ingredients inside of it. 
Will probably be back if I'm ever in that area again, but I wouldn't outright venture out there for it specifically. 
If you're close to the place, it's worth a visit :)"}
{"text":"Dear, Jumbo Empanadas, 
  Yes, Please.
  I adore this place.  Looking to eat on the cheap?  Perhaps dazzle your jealous co-workers with your lunch on a given Tuesday afternoon?  Jumbo Empanada delivers.  And I love it.  You will too, if you give it a try.
  The beef empanadas are a good size.  I'm not a fan of white doughy foods, and sometimes the crust is a bit hard, however, the book  I'm judging holds ground with what's inside.  What is inside, you ask?  Nicely spiced ground beef, mixed in with some surprising (atleast to me) treasures - a few plump raisins, black olives, and chunks of boiled egg.  It works.  Dip it in the salsa.  Love it.  The salsa is so good, I just want to rub it all over myself.  But I don't.  I save it for the empanada.  Duh.
  Happy times, friends.  Happy times.

Oh - I picked up a corn pie one day, and it fed me for four.  How's that for a bargin?"}
{"text":"swung in on a sunday afternoon and tried a beef empanada, chicken empanada, Tamale and a corn pie... empanadas were solid, tamale was good but the corn pie was incredible!!! had no clue what it was but after trying one its well worth coming back for! best i can describe it as is a sheppards pie with a corn mush crust... mildly sweet on top with a savory filling... perfect comfort food!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is called \"Jumbo Empanadas\" when the real name should be \"Fucking Delicious Corn Pie\"!  Those crazy Chileans.

First off, the empanadas are good.  Really good.  And cheap ($4).  However, the size of the empanadas (I swear) has shrunk over the years.  I don't know exactly, but if they cut the size down 10%, you can see the cost savings this amounts to spread over years.  I think it's an empanada conspiracy.

This is good reason for you to opt for the corn pie instead.  It's like a sweet corn Sheppard's pie consisting of chicken and beef (yummers), raisins, olives, and sweet corn .  As one friend put it, it's Boneriffic.

LOONIE & TOONIE RECOMMENDATION: $1.99 for a cheese empanada or $1 for a mini-empanada.  Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"I been to this location for years; but today I experienced the worse service from the owner Irene, I ordered 24 empanadas and was very surprised by the price increased I inquired about it and she mentioned everything has increased which I understood.  I asked her for the sauce which they always gave you with the empanadas and she added an extra 16.99 to my bill, when I asked about why she is charging me she said she always did which is not true and ended up saying \"if you don't like it live it\" What kind of a busyness owner will say this to a client.  She needs to learn to respect her clients as she is Canada."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, I really like it. For $5 you get a fresh empanadas, chicken/veg/beef. I've always had the chicken, never disappointed. And for healthy eaters like myself, this is a good option! They are baked, the filling is light but well flavoured. 

I like the little dining area they have. Its comfortable and great for a casual/drop-by lunch. The service is always very friendly :)

Warning! The salsa is spicy (little dips at a time is suggested)"}
{"text":"I have dreams about how good their avocado salad is. 

Consistently fresh salad composed of butter lettuce, dressed lightly with cilantro and vinegar, topped with slices of ripe avocado, and layered with fresh tomato, onion, and broccoli. I am not lying when I say this is my fave salad in the world. If I am not mistaken, it is also a vegan option - TRY IT PEOPLE!! Ok that was intense, just really in love with this salad :P

My fave empanada is the cheese variety (which seems fried but is absolutely delicious), followed closely by the chicken. Their salsa is killer good - super flavorful and a bit spicy! I love to dump a bunch of this into my empanada; flavour overload.

This is a must stop for me anytime I visit Kensington Market."}
{"text":"Good service, tasty empanadas.    Family run.   The cheese ones so great.   

Great!!"}
{"text":"No joke, I love this place. Their cheese empanadas are my favourite! I tried their chicken and beef ones last time and I could hardly move I was so full after."}
{"text":"Beef and Cheese Empanadas. Filling and good and convenient and held their shape well. Do remember to dip in that lovely salsa of theirs

I'm definitely coming back to eat some other schtuff!"}
{"text":"Yum! I was shopping in the market this weekend and all of a sudden realized I hadn't eaten anything yet that day, so decided now is finally the time to try Jumbo Empanadas.
It's a small place, and not exactly upscale, but who cares? The ladies behind the counter are so nice and friendly, the wait is short, and the end result is delicious. I had the chicken empanada. Salsa was served on the side, and I was out the door for around 5 bucks.
I ate it as I walked around the market and on my bus ride home. The complexity of flavours was surprising. There was also some heat, which I appreciate, but not too much for anyone who is sensitive to spice.  Another plus is it's really easy take-out food and perfect for strolling the neighborhood. Muy bien, jumbo empanadas!"}
{"text":"From someone that owns an empanada restaurant in Los Angeles, I must say that they sell really good empanadas !!! :)"}
{"text":"Again with the spanish food! So taking a stroll around kensington we tried to eat at the spanish place across from this one but they stopped serving! so in a dizzy we ended up here and good thing we did. Small (very very small) mom & pop shop. We waited too long for the food but it was well worth the wait. The Empanadas were just excellent. And the Pico de Gallo......so good! I tried to emmulate the recipe at home and was not successful in creating the same Pico :( non the less it was still good!

overall this place is good for a quick (not so quick) bite to eat! yumm!"}
{"text":"I was wandering about Kensington Market and had a sudden craving for...I had no idea what...I settled on an Empanada.  The place I would usually go to had a yellow rating, and not a green pass...so I had to pass.  I came here instead.

They do things in an interesting way here.  They take orders in bulk...and put them all in the oven, then everyone pays in order for what they ordered.  Then you wait, and hope they see you to get your food.

Lucky the beef empanada I had was tasty, otherwise I think I would have found the ordering process really off-putting.  I ordered the hubby a mini-chicken empanada since he waited for so long for me to get my food.

I even liked/didn't mind the raisins.  There's only a few of them in there.  I would come back."}
{"text":"90% of the time this place serves up well portioned, inexpensive and tasty jumbo empanadas.  Sometimes though, you get a chunk of dough with some flavouring inside.  If you come on one of the off days, try it again.  When they are good they are GOOD."}
{"text":"much like other folk whove reviewed this place, i stumbled upon it and decided to jump on for the ride.  well im not sure if i ever had an empanada either before this experience and i thought it was delicious.

i was actually very excited when i spotted this on yelp because i had forgotten about it.  the salad is very fresh, with a great dressing and filled with avocado - a great simple alternative to boring salads you get at most places that dont care too much about vegetables.

the salsa, and i am not usually a fan of it all, was delicious and i was wanting more.  

now i usually have a tough time deciding on a menu choice no matter where i go, and so the same went for here except for the fact that i did not resign to settling for just one menu item.

i took home one of the best pies ive ever had. there was this corn and beef pie that was juicy, tangy, meaty and delicious.

im going to make a point of going to kensington again right away just for this place."}
{"text":"Don't blink, as you might walk right by this place. The Kensington area is a must-go for tourists and locals alike. A visit to Kensington is not complete without devouring a couple jumbo Empanadas. These baked, latin American treats consist of a pastry shell stuffed with potatoes, veggies, spices, and the meat of your choosing. Ask for extra (spicy) salsa on the side. To die for. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Small place inside. Felt like a fast food joint. We ordered the corn pie and the beef empanada.
Both good. Especially the Corn Pie. Super sweet and tasty. 
Will revisit for sure."}
{"text":"I got a beef empanada, it's was pretty good. Nice place to grab a bite real quick. Great service, I asked for water I didn't even think she heard me, 2 min later she's brought me water. It's the little things :)"}
{"text":"Tasty Chilean empanadas. They really are jumbo. The carne (beef) ones are typical Chilean style, were stuffed with ground beef, black olives, hard-boiled egg and even a few raisins for a bit of sweetness. Freshly made.

I also tried a salad which was huge, healthy and delicious. A bit acidic but otherwise nice, lots of avocado, lettuce, tomato and broccoli. 

Not much in terms of decor inside but it's functional and does the trick. Good for take out."}
{"text":"Decent places for empanadas in Kensington market.  When they say spicy, they mean spicy!  Loved the sauce they served on the side."}
{"text":"BEEF EMPANADA
totally wonderful. for $3.99, you get a big empanada that's stuffed with beef, onions, olives and chunks of hard-boiled egg. the empanada is flavourful and juicy. i love the way the egg balances the flavours with a more mild taste. it's a must-get.

CHEESE EMPANADA
meh. it's tasty. i mean, it's melted cheese inside fried dough/pastry. but that's the thing: that is exactly what it tastes like - melted cheese and fried dough. nothing too special. but i went today and the person in front of me ordered 10 of them. and the person before him ordered three of them. so...give it a try. it's only $1.85 or something close to that (it's a mini empanada).

CHILEAN SALAD
lettuce, avocado, onions, tomatoes, dressed in a cilantro and olive oil dressing. don't order it unless you just need to have something refreshing and light. it's nothing special at all. i could not taste a bit of cilantro in the dressing, which was really disappointing because the cilantro was a big part of why i ordered the salad. also, the description for the salad on the wall said that there was going to be broccoli; nope, no broccoli in my salad. for $5, i wouldn't order this bland salad again.

THE SALSAAAAAA
this place makes fantastic salsa! i can't get enough. it's got this wonderful kick to it. it's spicy and sour. they sell the salsa in containers (S, M, L). everyone loves their salsa. i don't know why the counter people always ask if the customers want salsa because it's one of the reasons i go back!

CONS
1. gets very hot in the summer
2. pretty slow service (not a good combo with #1)
3. basically no waiting area (lots of people take out), which makes it awkward and squishy (also not a good combo with #1 and #2)."}
{"text":"What are you doing sitting there reading this review? You should be here munching on tasty empanadas! (Their humitas are damn good too)."}
{"text":"I was happy that we decided to try Jumbo Empanadas today after a long unsatiated desire for some good Mexican. El Trompo simply wasn't really cutting it in terms of quantity.

In retrospect, the at food at Jumbo Empanadas really was delicious! This place was a cafeteria style dive where you go up to the counter to order and grab your own cutlery. Not sure I'm a huge fan of that but or the fact that there is absolutely no AC here, not even a fan pointed our way.

Anyways, having read the reviews I ordered away. We got 2 Chilean salads, 2 beef empanadas, and 1 humita. 

The salad...well, it wasn't good. It sounded like it would be right up my alley with avocado, tomatoes, and cilantro...and only $4.50. The lettuce was more like the garnish leaves you'd get with your brunch at a diner. It was a bit bitter and tough in texture, no crunch, but instead was topped with just some lemon juice. I had to add salt and pepper to make it edible.

The empanadas. They were a perfect size and filled with delicious beef stew like mixture with hard boiled egg, onion, olives, and the delicious sweetness of some raisins, which were a nice compliment to the flavor. the crust was thick and crispy on the outside, but could have been sore and more doughy throughout and in the middle as the corners were a bit dry. This was taken care of with their little side dish of hot homemade salsa (though I'm a spice pussy so I couldn't enjoy it).

The last thing that we got was the humita, which was absolutely perfect. It was tasty cornmealy and moist. My mom wasn't eating much of the empanadas. At first I thought it was some sort of dieting technique but I soon realized that she just wanted there to be enough for me! Lol...I ordered a third beef empanada since they were so heartily delicious!

All three if us were stuffed and it was all for under $40 with a drink and tax included. Definitely very reasonable, however, being the stingy half Asain Jew I am, I was a bit disappointed to see their menu prices had been marked up from 3.99 to $5 for the empanadas and drinks were no longer included in any combo deals.

Next time I will certainly try the corn pie. Though they're more expensive at $8.50, they looked filling. knowing how delicious the humita was, it would be foolish not to get one of these instead of the tasteless Chilean salads. 

Bottom line, stop in for a bite to eat. The food is great."}
{"text":"Good and cheap empanadas, but holy hell this place is slow at lunchtime on nice sunny weekend.  Ya, I know that's the busy time.

Knocked off a star for the long wait.  Showed up to a 10 - 15 deep lineup but ended up waiting about 20 minutes from joining lineup to finally getting our empanadas.  Basically one nice cashier doing EVERYTHING - from dealing with the cash, reheating empanadas in the oven and prepping the orders.  I was asked no less than 3 times if I wanted salsa on the side in between other orders.  With the long wait and no one clearing the tables, everyone was squatting their tables while lining up causing a greater clusterfuck of hunger and confusion.  I don't deal well with this type of shit at all when I'm hungry.  If someone yelled 'Fire!', I guarantee at least one person would have been trampled to death.  So avoid if the place looks busy.

So ya, why did I spend most of this review talking about the wait rather than the food?  Well, obviously this place won't even be worth mentioning if the food was no good.  The beef empanada was flaky and I dug the raisins which for my sweet meat tooth.  Even the odd Inca Gold cola was dope.  Will head back, but only if there's no line."}
{"text":"I love places that know what they do well, and keep it simple. It's called \"Jumbo Empanadas\" for a reason.

Think of this as a factory for empanadas. (expecting more is not recommended)

So just walk in, order a beef empanada, and eat it. Be surprised by olives, egg, and other healthy surprises.

Delicious, right?

De Nada, Empanada."}
{"text":"This  place is definitely in my top 5. I have others that I think are more delicious. Yet, this place RULES!  Its very tempting to have more than 1 empanada.  I tried their little ones too, however when it comes to the \"regular\" empanadas, they're beyond delicious.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had the chicken empanadas, the crust was nice and golden and the inside was well seasoned and very juicy. The salsa was so tasty! Needless to say I am hooked and will definitely come back to try all the different empanadas."}
{"text":"Someone else said it already, \"The food is good but not spectacular.\"

The menu is pretty basic (chicken, beef, or cheese empanadas).  We ordered 1 beef and 1 cheese.  With two drinks, our food came out to $11.  Jumbo Empanadas is a good stop in Kensington Market for cheap eats especially if you don't want a heavy meal.  They're also good for sharing.  I preferred the cheese empanada by far.

I'm really surprised that a place that has \"empanadas\" in the name doesn't have a bigger variety or do something a little more creative.  The cartoon empanada painted on the door is adorable though."}
{"text":"We ordered several regular sized beef and chicken empanadas as well as the corn pie.  We placed our order as take-out and all the items were bagged cold from the refrigerator.  They provided heating instructions after we asked, and I assume the same empanadas are reheated in their ovens for the eat-in orders.  The empanadas reheated fine, but we found the filling a bit bland.  The corn pie also reheated fine and was different than what I had expected.  It was more of a cream of corn casserole, but maybe that is how it was supposed to be."}
{"text":"Was a little disappointed that everything was taken out of the freezer and reheated and both empanadas were still cold in the middle. The taste was great, just wished it didn't seem as cheap as it actually was. Given the price and taste I would probably go back to give it another try."}
{"text":"Very cute family-run restaurant...got recommended by a close friend during our visit around Christmas. We tried their beef, chicken and veggie empanadas and they are decent. I wish they could be a bit less greasy and salty though. The price is good and the owners are super friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"This is the place that I go to when I want a little taste of Chile. A lot of their empanadas taste just like my grandma's. I took my boyfriend to this little place for his first Chilean dining experience and he loved it. We ordered three empanadas de queso, my boyfriend had a veggie empanada and I had a chicken empanada. All of which were delicious. We also ordered hunitas that taste like the ones my grandma makes. So good and so fresh and filling. The sopapillas were awesome as well. Overall for the amount of food we ate, we only paid about $22 which was awesome. The portions are generous and they are so tasty and filling. Great service and such tasty  treats"}
{"text":"Family owned business for as long as most remember. Absolute true taste of home. We mostly get take out but there is some seating and a patio that does transport you to Chile.

Quaint, simple and delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great empanadas in the Chilean style and cheap too.  There seems to be a constant stream of bulk purchasers walking out with trays of these, I don't know if whole offices are ordering lunch here or whether other Chilean restaurants have just given up and order their empanadas from here.  Come, eat and then walk it off exploring Kensington market."}
{"text":"Empanadas, yes.  Jumbo, yes.  Excellent, yes.

Love the empanadas.  The little cheese ones are past decadent.  The salsa is *crisp*, it is so fresh and tasty.  Corn pie, awesome.  I never seem to get there before the little dessert-y things are sold out.  Some day.

Best of all - the salad and the amazingly bright-tasting dressing.  It's the kind of salad a fussy \"no thanks, nothing\" kid will nibble at - and then you realize you need to order two more salads.

Great food.  The eating spaces (indoor and out) could be a bit cleaner, but what do we expect from Kensington Market - white tablecloths?  but yeah, clean floors/walls/table would make this a five."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic Chilean food - an institution in the Kensington Market according to locals/papers etc. I had heard about it in the \"lunches for $5ish\" review in last weeks Now Mag and decided I'd try it out. I was not disappointed. They now have mini empanadas for $1/each so you can sample all three - beef, chicken or vegetarian. I went for the \"jumbo\" chicken empanada stuffed with a mixture of chicken, egg and green olives and a small side of spicy salsa. It was piping hot and delicious but I did think a heartier side of salsa would have been nice. Next time I go I'll ask for a double shot! 

They also have beautiful looking avocado salads, corn puree wrapped in leaves (forget the name but it's on the chalkboard and sounds fantastique) and the classic coconut dipped dulce de leche cookies in glass cases on the countertop. 

I was staying inside to keep cool but they have a really sweet patio out front for prime people watching."}
{"text":"Delicious $4.50 empanadas that fill you the heck up! Filled with beef, veggie or chicken, and different ingredients (olives, raisins, cheese etc) and very friendly owners :)"}
{"text":"I have an empanada shaped hole in my heart. The best."}
{"text":"SO DELICIOUS! 

I love this Kensington gem. It's one of those places that doesn't stand out too much, but is so insanely delicious. 

My personal favorite order: 

- Beef Empanada 
- Salad (to be shared with my dining partner)
- San Pellegrino (Blood Orange, ideally). 

I can get this all for about $10 - a great value for a filling and delicious lunch! 

The only downside to this place (which is also a perk, in a way) is the limited seating. If you're going around lunch time, it can be totally packed, which makes waiting and eating a bit more difficult. I tend to go elsewhere if I'm there for a super busy time. 

Also a warning to fellow raisin haters out there: the beef empanada has 3-4 (yes, I've counted) GIANT (gross, bleh) raisins baked inside. Fortunately their giant-ness makes them easy to spot and remove!"}
{"text":"A passenger who shared an Uber ride with me while I visited Toronto, recommended this place. While the empanadas are big, the taste was average. The beef empanada had more flavor than the chicken one, but both were a little dry and bland."}
{"text":"LOVEE this place!!! hands down best empanadas! and talk about their amazing salsa!! I live on the west side but I make sure that when I'm having one of those days when I'm craving empanada I come all the way to Kensington Market for this!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend on stocking up on any of the empanadas. Beef are my favourites. They freeze well and are a perfect dinner for 1 on a cold Toronto night. Salsa freezes okay too."}
{"text":"My one star is for the pico de gallo. Which in comparison to everything else was DELICIOUS!

This is not my first time eating an empanada, it's not even my fifth time. I love empanadas, but what I ate from here was not an empanada. Sure it had a boiled egg inside, raisins and other goodies. But what was with the beef?! It was like pureed baby food wrapped in the thickest empanada ever. I wanted to love it after all the reviews but it just plain sucked. 

I'll be trying my luck elsewhere in Kensington Market."}
{"text":"One of my fav empanada shops..its huge, and fillings are at a great ratio."}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome, I'm glad I finally got to give it a try. I went with the beef jumbo empanada. She popped it in the oven and it came it oh so warm and fluffy. The empanada itself was fluffy, had a short of sweet hint to it, and the texture was like a dough pretzel. The inside had loads of beef in it, very flavorful and moist. The egg was a nice touch and olive as well. But what surprised me and made this this unforgettable was the radians!!! That sweet hint and chew made this empanada off the chart. 

Tip on how to eat this, rip off an end if you are taking it to go... pour salsa in and squeeze/shake whatever you got to do to mix it up. And take nice bites!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!

I love how simple and delicious the food here are!  The cheese empanadas are always my favourite, a Chilean salad as a side surprisingly completes it for me considering I am a heavy meat eater 

The meat empanadas are the JUMBO empanadas that are made fresh!  Quality is not forgotten here!  Fresh dough and fillings are made in house!

If you haven't been, come in and grab an empanadas when in Kensington Market"}
{"text":"Jumbo, indeed. I had two friends implore me into this fine establishment the other day, and as I was expecting to stop in here for a \"snack\", I clearly didn't read the sign quite properly. 

A lot of people here say they've never had empanadas before, and I have to say that I have also never had empanadas like *this* before. They were giant, fresh and the pastry had a mix of just the right doughy-ness and crispiness. My vegetarian choice was truly fantastic- very tasty and pretty full of veggies like spinach and mushroom (if my memory serves correct)- and that delicious salsa on the side, but after hearing the details of the meat-filled choice, I feel I cannot stop mentally preparing an excuse to accidentally run into Jumbo Empanadas on purpose some day very soon. 

I suppose I cannot regret my decision (to not have meat- because I am a definite carnivore) because it was based on a lack of information, and previous, non-definitive experiences with the dish in question. And dining with two vegetarians- yes, I should know better."}
{"text":"How do I rate my first experience with empanadas?? I found it A-OK!

For $3.99, my beef empanadas is big and filling!! 

This place is so busy and it took a long time to get my food... But I wish they warmed up my empanadas a little longer since it was still a little cold inside.

The inside of the restaurant is small and cramped.. I can barely slide myself into the chairs.. or maybe I just been eating too much??"}
{"text":"I found the chicken empanadas uninspiring and a bit muted in terms of seasoning. For 50 cents you get a small dish of salsa which was packed full of flavour but lacking in portion. The empanadas was also cool/cold in the middle, even after they had reheated it in the oven. Perhaps it would have been better if it was fresh. The dough surrounding the filling was good except for the thicker end pieces which I found was a bit gummy."}
{"text":"I was expecting to have my mouth blown away with deliciousness...it was not sadly. 
The empanadas were Home made and reasonably priced but really had very little flavour.
I'll try someplace else for empanadas next time"}
{"text":"The empanadas here are absolutely AMAZING, and only cost $5. My favourite is the beef - a juicy, flavourful mix of beef, olives, raisins, and a hardboiled egg inside a deliciously chewy crust (baked, not fried!). 

I've never tried the salsa, because my empanadas are always gone before I get to it, but my friend says that it's very good XD

I took a star off because the place is tiny, with a serious lack of seating. There was a patio outside but no chairs, despite the weather being gorgeous."}
{"text":"The cheese empanada was to die for. Soft. Warm. Gooey. I can eat them all day, everyday. 

The beef empanada was so so. I didn't find it that amazing out special."}
{"text":"Found this Chilean hole-in-the wall place tucked away in kesington market. It's a family run, low-key, cheap eats that's surprisingly very satisfying.

Corn pie (5/5) $8.50 - hands down my FAVOURITE dish, I've never had anything like it. The mixture of egg, sweet corns, chicken & ground beef, olives and onions just was the perfect balance of sweet and salty. I loved the sprinkles of raisins within too! 

Chicken & Beef jumbo empanadas (3.5/5) $4.50 each - the portions were huge, came with salsa on the side, empanada dough was thick & a bit dry, but the meat sauces within definitely made up for it. There was a good amount of meat filling as well, the beef was my personal favourite. 

Chilean salad (3/5) $5.50 - portion size was big, everything in it was quite standard, but I liked how much avocado they had !"}
{"text":"Another fantastic little place to get fresh empanadas.  You can't bat the freshly made side of salsa to go with it.  Like the previous reviews stated, very affordable and filling.  They also have mini empanadas for 1.00 if you just want a bite size snack.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Yuuuummmm! Jumbo empanadas was so good! Between 3 we shared 2 empanadas, beef and chicken, and a humita as part 1 of our lunch in Kensington. The beef empanada was out of this world! It was moist and the outside was crispy. The humita was also amazing! You could smell the corn the second you unwrapped the corn husks. It tasted divine!

Next time I'm there I'll have to try the corn pie!"}
{"text":"This place tastes like childhood. Allow me to explain. 

My mother is Chilean, in turn, I have had a lot of Chilean food in my lifetime. I have also been to Chile, so I can vouch and compare fairly. Jumbo Empanadas is spot on in authenticity. I'm obsessed with their classic beef empanada and plain cheese empanadas. But my boyfriend ordered the chicken empanada and like it! He also loved the humitas, which I have never been a fan of. They also make an amazing salsa which is served with everything. It's fresh and spicy vinegar-type of salsa. Their dough is spot on! Anyone who loves empanadas know that the dough makes it! Oh and their Chilean pastries are DIVINE!!!!

I can only imagine that anything else here is equally as good and authentic. I haven't strayed far from my usual suspects here. I'm a touch bias because I haven't tried any of the other empanada places in Toronto yet. That just goes to show HOW GOOD THESE ONES ARE!

Give them a try! I dare ya!"}
{"text":"I had a beef Epinada and it was so tasty and hearty and filling!  The place is very cute and have a distinct yet home-like atmosphere, and the staffs were very nice too!  Love it, 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"This is a must stop if you are in Kensington Market!

Not only do they make delicious empanadas, but their salsa is homemade-which scores big points in my books! I frequently pick up dinner for 2 for under $10!"}
{"text":"Cheap price, empanadas were pretty big and delicious. Cozy little restaurant, family run. Kind of hidden location, gotta pay attention when first time there."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying this place out!!

I wanted to order the veggie empanada and was wondering what was inside it.  The girl at the cash didn't know but took the time to ask one of the other people and told me a list of everything in it.  I was mainly wondering whether it would be full of potatoes, which would make me not order it, but it was full of spinach and other veggies so it was yes for me! I was happy with it and it came out fresh so the outside was really good. The pastry on the outside is pretty thick.

I had heard so much about this corn pie, so my friend and I decided to order it after we finish our empanadas. The lady said it would take a bit of time to serve it, which was cool. WOW, totally didn't expect it to be as big as it was.  This is a filling dish for one or a good dish to share. It was sweet, but there's also meat filling at the bottom which is weird, but strangely tastes really good!! 

Great place to come for a cheap meal."}
