{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place after a terrible experience at this location when it was known as Sunset Lounge (2.5 hours for sushi..raw fish?  Really?) In fact, I had every intention of avoiding altogether.  However, a friend suggested we try it, and since it was a quick walk for us, we headed over on Friday evening.

The hostess asked if we had reservations, but the place was nearly empty.  Of course, we were seated right away.  The drink list was extensive and I ordered a Sunset Martini, which I enjoyed.  Our server, Rory, was excellent.  The menu had pretty much anything to satisfy different tastes.

They bring out warm pita bread and 3 different dipping sauces, which was a nice change from the standard bread.   My friend ordered the lamb shank (slowly braised with red wine and root vegetables, served with roasted garlic & chive risotto), which was huge.  She enjoyed it and was able to take leftovers home.  I ordered the Zdara Burger (it just sounded good), which was  1/2 lb of premium ground beef with caramelized onions and shaved manchego cheese on a brioche bun.  It was served with wonderful Pomme Frites.  I had plenty for leftovers, and I'm not a leftover kind of girl :)

Since I almost always want dessert, I chose the Molten Chocolate Banana Date cake (or something like that, I can't remember the full name).  Simply AMAZING.

Prices were good, and most entrees were priced between $18-23.  My burger was $11.50.  I believe the dessert was $6, and the cocktails were $8.  For a decent place to eat downtown, I was happy with that.

I have a few concerns - I feel that most people may not realize how diverse the menu is, therefore avoiding it based on it being \"Mediterranean.\"  Plus, it's nestled in between Mallorca and Brasa, which I know are both pretty popular.  I was surprised to see that only 1 person had previously reviewed this restaurant on Yelp.  I worry because it was not very busy on a Friday night.

If you are looking for something new to try, go to Zdara.  I can't wait to go back and try different items on their menu.  Service was good, drinks were strong, portions were great!"}
{"text":"Went to Zdara for first time.  The food quality was bland and lifeless.  For better Mediterranean food, go to Aladdin's or Dolce Wraps.  Much better food and service for half the price.  The atmosphere was uninviting with cold decor.  The wait staff was not very personable and seemed as if they hated their lives and jobs at that moment, and it wasn't even crowded!  The place was 3/4 empty.  I would not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Great food & atmosphere!!!! Will def be back soon."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with a group for someone's birthday. Waiter had a hard time with splitting the checks between us. Seemed like a large group (of about 8) was something he'd never served before. 

For the price, the food was very very good. The lambchops were strangely small however. Weird. That price didn't match up. 

The service was the biggest downfall. Seemed there was one server for the entire restaurant possibly. Our guests were constantly waiting for refills of drinks. The appetizer and entree wait time was pretty extended. I believe it was a full hour until our entrees arrived. 

Overall the food was good, however this experience would not make me return or recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience at Zdara.  We had a party of 20.  We received very good customer service from drinks to desserts.  The food was 4.5 out of 5.  I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Pass on this restaurant and go to the less expensive Alladins where you will have better service, food, and ambience.  Though the server tried hard, he could not have overcome the overpriced, tasteless, lukewarm food coming out of the kitchen.  We had such high hopes..but left disappointed with the entire experience."}
{"text":"I actually rounded up from a 1.5.  I hate to be negative, but do yourself a favor and do not go to Zdara.  Take it from a Lebanese girl...the food is not great.  Try Aladdin's or Taza for some authentic food.

I was there last night with two of my cousins (yes, a table of Lebanese ladies).  We ordered:

-Martinis- too sickly sweet (how do you mess that up???)
-Baba- oddly smoky
-Grape Leaves- the others said they were just ok
-Hummus- just ok
-Tabouli- not bad
-Kibbee- surprisingly pretty good
-Falafel- dry

And the pita bread seemed to be heated in the microwave because it got a bit hard after a few minutes.  

All in all, I won't be back.  I'm sorry to say that, but in a town with a ton of great restaurants, you need to be better."}
{"text":"I'm going to take a section from the Book of George, as I was there with my boyfriend and friends. It, frankly, was a very unpleasant experience. For a \"four star\" restaurant, it was maybe a 2.5/3.0 max. The food was no better than going to my grandmother's house of a corner family owned business. 

And the wait staff.... Like George said, they have got the 'wait' part down very well. From the time we sat down we had waited about 35 minutes for just a DRINK(Diet Pepsi mind you)... On top of that 35 minute wait, let's tack on another 25 to place our order(and at that time the 'wait'er was very confused and absent-minded)... From the time we placed our appetizer and dinner order we waited over an hour for the food to arrive.
In between appetizer and dinner was, low and behold, another 25 minute wait. By the time we got our actual dinner, everyone was so hungry they would have eaten a plate of gravel.  Total time of wait for dinner was 1 hour and 10 minutes, total wait time from sitting until we received food 1 hour 45 minutes.

If you want to read more about our experience read George S.'s review, he has got in down pat. I doubt we will be back there..."}
{"text":"According to yelp..two stars means: \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" That is exactly the case here...Z'dara was eh...it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.

I have only been here once, but I don't really see myself coming back. There just wasn't anything really memorable about here. I ordered the lamb shank, and it was just so plain. The meat was nice and tender, but it had no flavor. The people I was with seemed to enjoy their meals, but nothing they had looked that great to me.

When I was here, it was a Friday night around dinner time. The place was pretty empty, so I must not be alone in my opinion of the place.

Maybe if this place was cheaper I would bump up the review a star, but it definitely wasn't worth it for the price.

I do hear that they have a decent happy hour though..."}
{"text":"I rarely write a negative review, but my experience at the Mediterranean-themed Zdara has forced me to be less than kind.

How do I begin; this evening, I attended a get-together with friends at Zdara. My good friends Allison and Robert were having a double celebration; her birthday, and their recent news that they were due to be parents. This should have been a joyous, enjoyable, relaxing time...

Should have been...

Firstly, it seemed that the wait-staff have too much experience in the \"wait\" part of their job. It took our party of ten a while to get drinks, and even then, the waiter seemed confused by our requests of \"diet soda, no ice\" or the like. They almost seemed a bit nervous all around, which was odd, because as far as I knew, my friends and I were not dressed like either Vikings or the Manson family. 

After a friend of mine ordered a mixed drink and didn't see the waiter (another waiter, mind you, from the first one) for nearly 20 minutes, I got up and went to the bar and asked for his drink FOR him. The bartender was flabbergasted and then handed me a drink quickly, a drink he had no idea had been ordered, which I then walked back to my friend. 

After that, it was more waiting. Now, I know you might be thinking I'm being overly dramatic, but as we ordered, then waited for, firstly, the appetizer plates, which, I think from the order time took nearly 35 minutes to get to us, and then the final entrees arrived, it was nearly an hour and  ten minutes. Two couples right next to our group were seated, fed, and left in that time. I thought our section might be trapped in food-limbo. 

On the subject of the food, it was, in my humble opinion, just \"okay\". My friends' cheese plate was...not Mediterranean. However, it was some tasty sage and purple Darby with candied walnuts and frozen (and I mean frozen) grapes. 

I had gotten the \"Cajun chicken kabobs\" which were okay, but remember folks, searing something till its edges are crispy and black does not a \"cajun\" anything make. Other folks had things like the salmon or the lamb chops, which they enjoyed, but overall, the atmosphere made it hard to enjoy food we'd waited so long for.

My opinion overall? They really need to re-asses their structure in this place and perhaps get the wait staff up to speed, other wise they all might be waiting for customers to show up...and they'll we waiting a LONG TIME for that."}
{"text":"While the food at Zdara is good (not great), it is extremely overpriced for what you're getting.  Literally, for 2 kifta kebabs and some tasty rice, the bill is near $20.  While that may not sound like a lot, let me remind you there is a kebab stand a couple of blocks away that is equally good, and 1/3rd the price, albeit, lacking the ambiance of Zdara.  All in all, nothing special about this place and certainly better value can be found at other offerings in the surrounding W 6th neighborhood."}
{"text":"\"what are you??\"

that's a question i do get fairly regularly these days, asked in the context of a well-meaning midwesterner trying to figure out my ethnicity.

but in this instance, i'd like to throw that question back at Zdara.

like many restaurants in the Cleve, Zdara seems to attempt to mix in cuisines from a bunch of nations within a geographic region, rather than really concentrating on the tastes of one.  so i guess \"Mediterranean\" is really the best term to describe the menu, which is really more a potpourri of Greek, Turkish, Italian, French, and plain ol' American.

as a result, their menu is a bit schizophrenic.  the entree section looked somewhat uninspired, but the appetizers had some creative choices.  but how about taste?  a homey of mine and i ventured forth to figure this place out on a weekday night.

i got the beef kebobs served over rice, and my homey got the salmon with sun dried tomatoes, herbs, and potatoes.  the food was pleasantly flavorful, especially the salmon.  and thankfully not too dry.

the ambience was nice, and the service was great as well.  located in the heart of the warehouse district, i'm sure Zdara's vibe is much more lively on the weekends, but during weeknights, it's a fine place to have a conversant dinner.

so while the Z provides a trendy dining venue with some interesting flavors, true foodies may be left wanting more.

i'll give 'em 4 stars.  they're my peeps.  since, based on how they define it, apparently, i'm Mediterranean too.  :)"}
{"text":"I've gotta second \"Lebanese Girl's\" (Sue S.) review - this place is a disappointment.  My wife and I quietly scarfed down our food and skipped dessert just to beat feet sooner than later.  It's not that the food was bad (i.e. rotten), it just didn't strike the Mediterranean chord!  There was no savoring the culinary arts here - we had made a mistake choosing this place so let's high-tail the heck outta here!

As for my dish, I had ordered the lamb kabobs as an entree but they must've thought I ordered an appetizer!  For the price, could the pieces of meat on the 3 skewers really get any smaller or fewer?!  As for the quality & flavor.... meh...

Dining room wasn't crowded either - sorta like the \"before\" scene on an episode of Kitchen Nightmares!

The music?  No, nothing Mediterranean.  Dance remixes of songs like Solveig's \"Hello\" and other techno-dance tunes you'd expect clubbing but not dining on shwarma and falafel!

Limp back to the East side we went - maybe Mad Greek or Aladdin's to bring us back to the proper flavors of the Mediterranean!  Sorry guys - better luck next time!"}
{"text":"Zdara has some really fantastic items on its menu, such as the grilled halumi and the popcorn falafel.  That, combined with their reasonable happy hour drink prices bump it up to 4 stars.

However, diners should be forewarned that the restaurant seems to be suffering from some growing pains possibly attributable to poor management.  The service is inconsistent, as is the dining experience.  The first time I ate there, within the restaurant's first week of business, my stuffed salmon entree was serously undercooked (much of the fish was raw, and the crab stuffing was room tempurature).

I still recommend this restaurant, though, as a nice alternative to the more traditional American fare elsewhere in the Warehouse District."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go. Maybe for the wrong reasons.

I love the look of the restaurant, it's clean, modern and makes you feel like you're living in new york or L.A. for a day. It's also usually empty, which feels like Scooby doo would shiver and nervously go rut roh.  but our waiter is always amazingly friendly and treated us like we were guests in his home. 

The food is fun - well plated and strong flavors. My snapper entree was cooked perfectly and full of well balanced flavor. The veggies were placed on top, though they seemed to have been sitting around a while. The glaze on the veggies was a bit on the salty side and seeped into the fish though, which combined with the acidity of the lemon, forced me to eat in smaller bites or end up making weird faces befitting of a kid tasting mcd's sweet and sour sauce for the first time.

The kenafe here is amazing and one of my favorite things in life...it's not the traditional lebanese or palenstinian kenafe you usually get at smaller shops, it is a handmade freshly baked work of art. It's shredded phyllo dough with sweet goat cheese filling, then drizzled luxuriously with a simple syrup. The texture is a perfect crispy crunchy sweetness til you get to the jesusly melted sweet saltiness of the cheese. I can't get enough of it - if you've ever had the famous kenafe's from michigan, those taste like old socks in texture and flavor in comparison.

The burger is also great, as is the bread and dips, though the latter is milder in flavor than you may be used to or expect."}
