{"text":"I and my husband have gone to Table since they opened. At first it was a little bumpy but you could see the potential. We frequented Table over the past few years and were quite happy. Fast forward to about a year ago - new management, new menu, new staff. I went for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Tonight we went for dinner and were very disappointed. Many open tables and now I see why. The calamari was over cooked and the service was awful. This is our last time giving them the benefit."}
{"text":"The food here has been very good every time. The pork shank (called \"The Pork Shank Redemption\") is fantastic. 
During my first visit the waiter claimed the The spinach salad (garnished with pancetta & fried goat cheese) was \"life changing\". Well, my life seems for the most part unchanged, but easy top 5 best salads I've ever had.  
I would like to see a better selection of bottled beer, but I can enjoy the meal with what they offer."}
{"text":"The interior of Table 22 is \"warehouse meets brick oven\" and the ambient noise can be a little overwhelming. The clientele at the bar?  On a weeknight, it's old men in track suits or golf get-ups.  (Remember, though, this is Murrysville - it's not like Lenny Kravitz and Miranda Kerr are going to be hanging out here.)  The beer selection is not as good as Bella Luna up the street, and I'd give the bar staff a 4 out of 10 for attentiveness.  But, hey, whatever - how about those marinated lamb pops?  They're the stars of the show."}
{"text":"Table is close for us so we have been there many times over the years.  We stopped patronizing this place.  The food is so-so.  The service is not what one should expect in a restaurant whose pricing calls for excellent service.   The bartenders choose to stand and talk amoung themselves instead of serving the customers.   We eat out alot, and unfortunately avoid Table because of the service.  This place could be great, not sure why they can't get it right.  Atrias is several doors down and has a wait line outside the door......."}
{"text":"Not great - average to below average food. Expensive considering what you get and the service has been below par every time I have been here."}
{"text":"What an awful restaurant.  The food is absolute garbage.  I got soup and it was lukewarm and tasted like melted ice cream it was so sweet.  The salad was decent enough but nothing special.  The beer list is not very good and the service was bad.  The food was also very slow too.  Probably the worst restaurant I've ever been to in the Pittsburgh area, A-V-O-I-D."}
{"text":"Father's day dinner. Disappointing service, limited air conditioning, minimal food for price. Shrimp stir fry for $18 included 4 small shrimp with tails on on top of rice and veggies.Wow. When questioned about portion was told \"that's all the shrimp you get.\" As much as pork shank was enjoyed, attitude and miniscule entrée for my son give this former go to establishment a LEAVE IT rating."}
{"text":"Just ok"}
{"text":"I have been to Table twice; once for a lunch date with my husband (we were the only people in the restaurant) and last Saturday for a dinner party with a large group of friends.  While the flavors of the Margherita Pizza were outstanding, the sauce eventually made the crust soggy from having sat for too long in the window.  The Chicken Romano was well done except the risotto that was served alongside of it was too busy and didn't not compliment the simple chicken very well.  I should have ordered the pork shank which clearly is the standout menu item.  I was lucky enough to sample my husband's.  The biggest thing that stands out about Table is the service.  It is horrible.  On our first visit, we waited far too long for all aspects of our meal (drinks, ordering, the check).  It was pretty clear we were not there for a leisurely lunch.  This past Saturday took the cake and was what compelled me to write this.  As we had such a large party, we had two servers.  One half of our table was carefully attended to and was offered drinks, appetizers, etc.  Our server barely came by to ask if we wanted a drink let alone if we were ready to order.  The other half of our table was finishing appetizers when our server asked us if we were interested in ordering anything.  She was never around and we actually had to ask other staff to find her.  It also just so happens that our table had the bulk of the children.  I'm not sure if that was a turn off or what but needless to say if this was the last time I visit Table, it will surely be because of the staff and the horrible service, not the food."}
{"text":"This place took over for bruschetta's in February.  I kept looking for the witch's feet under the building as this restaurant appears to be displaced from somewhere either in shadyside or downtown.   The bar is a great place to watch a football or hockey game.  The menu is confusing as they editorialize to much of the food.  Just say what it is and dont try to be cute!  The hamburger I had there was average, but the Italian sandwich i ordered this past Saturday night was full of flavor and if it had a touch more meat it would of been spectacular.  A big part of the success of the sandwich came from the bread and herbs.  The person sitting next to me at the bar ordered the ahi tuna and it looked bad, barely seared on the outside.  Another person sitting near me ordered the personal pizza (they dont call it pizza though).   Be prepared because it is tiny and looks more like an appetizer than a meal.  The place is new, so i will give it time and another chance and hopefully there will be many playoff games to give it another go."}
{"text":"Table 22 is a cornerstone of the relatively meager Murrysville dining scene.  The space is cavernous.  Its high ceiling and exposed mechanicals are typical of strip mall restaurant design.  The dimly lit dining area is not physically separated from the large bar, and high backed benches screen only some of typical Friday night liveliness.  The centerpiece of the room is a rounded stone chimney/oven sort of thing that stretches all the way to that high ceiling.  It is echoed by similarly vertical wine racks in the bar.  The former outdoor dining area on the side of the building was enclosed some time ago, providing ample room for additional tables.  It still feels like the completely separate space it once was, and the design of that space seems to evolve weekly, as management grapples with the tight, noisy confines.

The drink list includes the expected mix of cosmopolitinis.  There's also a modest mix of micro brews.  \"Winey\" Wednesdays feature a few decent wines at a steeply discounted price.

The menu is fairly extensive, and daily specials are usually thoughtful additions.  Indeed, Table's greatest asset is the kitchen's effort.  There's little trace of Sysco standard glazes slathered on mediocre cuts of protein.  Instead, you can watch your flatbread being hand tossed into that brick oven.  The lawn boy is an ample helping of arugula, prosciutto and balsamic goodness on thin crisp dough.  The signature pork shank redemption is ideally done, and massive.  The occasional special veal chop is tender and will satisfy the largest appetite.  Burger patties are hand formed and not too tightly packed.  The pasta and peppers dish is overflowing with peppers, some hot, as advertised, and more than enough.  The Italian sandwich is meaty, cheesy and perfectly toasted in the brick oven.  Some dishes miss the mark.  For example, fries are clearly previously frozen, and a disappointment.  Perhaps the deep fryer is not hot enough.  Salads are inconsistent.  Almost frozen, chopped romaine makes for a poor Caesar, though the entrée version's grilled chicken is juicy and appropriately done.  The spinach and goat cheese salad, on the other hand, is well constructed.

Service too is inconsistent, ranging from fine to disinterested.  In the last year or so, new management came in and there has been some improvement; however, continued improvement is needed.  Still, we go back almost weekly and are generally satisfied."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great menu selection, meal was fantastic.  I will definitely be returning for future dinners.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Table has been in the Murrysville scene for several years now, however I never made it there until being home for Christmas when my parents and I felt like going out but staying semi-local. We ended up choosing Table and made reservations (not needed) for an earlier dinner (5:30) on a Friday night. 

The layout of the restaurant feels a bit cramped in my opinion especially for just duos who mainly seemed to have tables only flush against the wall on the sort of three season porch area. We had a half booth in that porch type area. It seems like the bar space is the nicest and most spacious. When we left the bar also seemed to be more crowded than the actual restaurant itself.

We shared the Ahi Tuna app, which was pretty overpriced at $14 for what we got. (See my picture of it.) For dinner, there were six options which were part of a two for $25 special. We confirmed that those are slightly smaller portions with our server and instead all opted for regular entrees. I had the crab cakes which while smaller than many others I have ordered were pretty good. It, like the tuna app, came with a really bland pickled cuke salad, and it also had a side of some pretty bland rice pilaf. Mom had the scallops and fried rice dish which was good but salty. Dad went for a seafood pasta dish that was labeled in the menu as Cajun or spicy, and that was no joke. He is a guy who can do spicy foods, but this one was a bit hard even for him. Everyone agrees that the bread that was provided while we waited was delicious. Super soft with a just right crunchy crust. Apparently they bake it there, probably in the open brick oven that they also make their pizzas in.

The service was pretty fair with nothing too noteworthy on that end. It wasn't a particularly bad or great experience. We will likely go back at some point in the future, but won't really rush that decision."}
{"text":"I like this place because it doesn't feel like you're in Murrysville.  The decor is dark and trendy.  The food is typically pretty good (though I wasn't a fan of the lobster roll that I tried recently).  The service has always been good for us.  I was a little annoyed when I was asked if I wanted soup or a salad, and the salad ended up being full price (Why are you asking then?  Wouldn't I have ordered the salad if I wanted it?).  AND the salad was way overpriced ($7 for a tiny pile of spinach, onions, and one fried ball of goat cheese is way too much).  But the balsamic dressing was tasty, so I didn't end up complaining about it - though I'm clearly harboring some resentment.  But we'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Good service.

I started with the caesar salad. Basic, but good. Next I tried the lawnboy flatbread. Very tasty. One complaint. My friend had the ahi tuna -- not the best.

We ended up at the bar. Good entertainment and friendly crowd. If I lived in the area, I would return."}
{"text":"I'm blasting this place because the entire restaurant staff was in a blatantly terrible mood, noticed by my table and other patrons of the restaurant.  It's a shame, too because the food actually was pretty good and the restaurant did have a trendy feel to the place, which would set it apart for the local scene in Murrysville.

Maybe lunch isn't the right time to come, but it really turned me off...and I'm new to the area and would love to get some \"regulars\" in the rotation.  

Not sure if this place is going to get a second chance...and if it does, it won't be for a while."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and I love the food. The Lawnboy is fantastic! However the service is not so good. Two of the times I've been there my waiter was Mark. He was extremely slow and on the verge of rude. I think he was trying to be sarcastic and funny but it came off creepy. He took forever to take our order and tried to wait until after 2pm so that we couldn't get the \"express\" lunch. While we waited almost 15 minutes for our check we could hear him talking to someone about a woma  being a hooker! The restaurant was pretty empty so there is no reason why we should have waited as long as we did."}
{"text":"Table is a good place for fine dining. It doesnt have a lot of competition since its in Murrysville so it doesnt take much to be number one but i have a feeling even with variety in the area it still would be the best. Great atmosphere. Friendly people and its right in the heart of Murrysville."}
{"text":"I are here last night with my boyfriend and his family. We called ahead to make reservations and when we arrived the reservation was never made and no available seating in the dining room. We had 5 people and had to sit at a 4 person table on the bar side. It left us cramped when it came time to eat. As for the food i ordered a flatbread. One with prosciutto, tomatoes, cheese, arugula and a balsamic reduction. It was very good. The flavors worked well together and a nice portion for the price."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Table 22 is really nice. It would be a lot better if they didn't herd you in there like cattle. Be sure to specify where you want to sit when you make your reservation. We made a reservation for 2 and were jammed into a tiny table in the back corner between 3 large parties. There were plenty if other tables around, but when we asked, the hostess said they were already \"requested.\" We've been to Table 22 on three separate occasions, and were seated in the same table twice.

Although the menu looked big and appealing. The food left something to be desired every time we went. We got the \"yinzer salad\" (essentially a Pittsburgh style chicken salad) on our most recent trip and the mixed greens were brown full of stems. Not worth the $11 if you ask me...

The wait staff were nice, but we had to ask three times for a glass of water with our wine. Also, why they boast a major wine list, several items we attempted to order were \"unavailable.\"

Over all, Table 22 is a classic example of the old saying, \"Never judge a book by it's cover.\" Although the appealing atmosphere and cleverly written menu will entice you, you will unfortunately be disappointed."}
{"text":"Alright, my family always decides to come here when we have family in from town.  But after this last trip, I feel like we might have to change to a new venue. 

First off, the service was pretty much a joke.  I mean I eventually felt bad for our waitress because the manager was an absolute witch.  Our waitress didnt tell us any specials, never brought us bread, and most importantly she brought our table the wrong bottle of wine.  Let me elaborate on this last point.

If you have ever been to this place, you know the atmosphere: very cool, dark, and facncylike.  I do not understand the whole \"lets have as few lights in the resturant as possible.\"  So my uncle asked our waitress for a bottle of fancy French wine.  When she brought it to the table, she showed it to my uncle, and then had him taste it.  My uncle took one sip and looked very unsatisfied.  He took another sip which concluded with another puzzled look.  He eventually Okayed the wine, but everyone at the table could tell something was up.  About two minutes later the bottle was in front of me, and I said to the table, \"What kind of wine is made in Oregon?!\"  The table responded, \"that bottle is from France, not Oregon.\"  My uncle took the bottle, put it next to candle (the one source of light on the table), and started to read.  It was a bottle from Oregon; the waitress messed up.

Now my uncle was upset at the fact the waitress had brought us this bottle, but he was not going to cause a fit.  He simply asked the manager when she came around if we could get the correct bottle.  He did not want a free bottle, simply he wanted the one he originally ordered.  After my uncle told the manager the situation, she walked away for about two minutes.  When she came back she had the Oregon bottle in her hand and said to my uncle, \"Well the waitress said she presented you with the bottle and had you try it.\"  I COULDNT BELIEVE MY EARS?!?  Was the manager of this restuant really getting sassy with my uncle because the WAITRESS brought HIM the wrong bottle of wine?!?!  Are you kidding me.

I then started feeling badly for our waitress because when she returned with the proper bottle, the witch manager stood over her shoulder and stared at her until she opened the bottle.  She was having a tough time with the cork, but it wasnt her fault; it was a bad cork.  

The food turned out decent; my salad was really good, but the fact that the staff completely put a damper on the night kind of made me forget about my overpriced side salad.  The only reason they are getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because the food was actually good.  If you normally read my reviews you probably are wondering, \"when is he gonna start detailing his food that he ordered and ate?  What did his family get? How many minutes was it sitting on the table before it was gone?\"  Well the expirience with the place was that negative that I feel like Table 22 does not deserve my usual excitement.  

PS  GET SOME MORE LIGHTING"}
{"text":"The service is soooooo slow.  Apps always seem to come out with your entree and then your waiter disappears. The chips and salsa, guac and queso were very bad.  I would not recommend this place to friends or family."}
{"text":"I went to dinner here last night with my husband and his family to celebrate our sister in law's birthday. Our experience was wonderful! Our waitress was polite and attentive and came back to check on our table numerous times during the meal. For appetizers, we ordered the calamari, the polenta with blue cheese and crab meat and the margarita flatbread pizza. All of them were very tasty, but my favorite was the polenta! It was perfectly cooked, creamy and full of flavor. There was just the right amount of crab meat and the blue cheese cream sauce that was drizzled on top was just perfect! That, paired with the fresh, warm bread that was served, was a perfect start to the meal. For dinner, I ordered the 8oz filet with a Parmesan crust, served over pasta with mushrooms. It was wonderful! The steak was a little over cooked, but not by much. The mushrooms were cooked just right and added a ton of flavor to the dish. For dessert, we all shared the chocolate chip cookie sundae and a warm cinnamon apple pie torte. Both were amazing and I am glad I saved some room to order one! I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved into the area and wanted to try this restaurant. I guess it's not anything that I expected. I thought it would be more drinks and good pizza and pasta and subs. IT SAYS BRICK OVEN AND BAR ON THE SIGN! But I was fooled. I had sausage and pepper pasta and my husband had shrimp and grits. Somehow, the cook managed to make both these dishes the greasiest food I've ever eaten. Like my food was orange with grease. Ugh. I will say the drinks were wonderful and our waitress was pretty decent. I will give it one more go, then I will call it quits."}
