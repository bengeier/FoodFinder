{"text":"Thought i would be hip and try this \"fancy hotdog joint.\" I don't know what these hipsters are thinking. $8 bucks for a hotdog i could buy at Giant Eagle or a Sunoco for a dollar. Dogs weren't even bun size, or 1/4 pound. Fries were soggy and below average. I will stick to Frankies right down the street, or boil some dogs at home before i ever spend another dime at this joint."}
{"text":"Recently went there with a large group of friends, and was pleasantly surprised. I'm not a big fan of hot dogs to being with - but the food was amazing. Fresh, served hot and very tasty. There were 10 of us in the group and everyone was very happy with their orders. Will definitely stop back. 

The only downside was how pricey the drinks were. I ordered an Amaretto Sours and was charged $7 for the amaretto and then an additional $3 for the sours. Most of the drinks were $10+. 

Our server, Jonathan, was great. Even with a large party and a busy Saturday night, he was attentive. We didn't wait long for drinks or food, the table was cleared off quickly and the checks were ready to go when we were. 

Highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Food was great! Tried several different menu items (Oahu dog, frites, other stuff) all was wonderful. Only gripe is food took quite awhile."}
{"text":"I love the idea of this place but it needs a little more to be amazing.  

The wait staff is amazing and super pleasant.  We arrived 15 minutes before the kitchen closed and they still treated us well and didn't make us feel rushed.  They refilled out drinks without asking and were very attentive.

The food was good but not amazing.  I like the idea of customizing your own hotdog with different regional styles.  I got the down under Pittsburgh dog.  My problem was with the size of the hot dog.  I was looking for something more substancial.  It wasn't filling at all.  We also got the poutine which was what you would expect from a 7 dollar poutine...good but nothing that blows you away.

Maybe we would go back as a novelty but not on a regular basis.  To spend that much for a hotdog I need to be blown away or at a pirates game."}
{"text":"Delicious food in a cute little store.  It's easy to miss if you aren't looking for it, but it's worth the trip.  The hot dogs are good, of course, but the fruit smoothies and the bottled soft drink selection are what pleasantly surprised me.

I first heard about this joint back when it was called Hot Dogma (I think there was a copyright or trademark dispute) and it was featured on the Food Network.  It's too bad for all the East End college students that they're only open during the week."}
{"text":"I love hot dogs and expected much more of this place. It didn't seem expensive when seeing the menu but the hot dogs are really small, you don't get much of each topping and they charge you separately even for the bun! I felt ripped-off and will definitely not return. Simple food should stay simple."}
{"text":"Franktuary is the best place I've eaten in Pittsburgh. The staff is amazing and the food is so beautifully presented I thought I was at MoMa. The food is so reasonably priced because the quality of the food is very high. I was ever so impressed with Franktuary's new location; I the only thing that surprised me was how classy it was. I was a little disappointed that the new store was nothing like its punk downtown companion. But the food is getting better and better."}
{"text":"I got to eat here while visiting a friend in Squirrel Hill, and I loved it!  A restaurant based around a bunch of different combinations of hot dogs, and they were delicious.  My table tried 6 different hot dogs (3 people, 2 each) and they were all amazing! The price is great as well, as you can order 2 and it will come out to about the same price as a standard meal at another restaurant which gives you the opportunity to try out some different combinations.  The vibe was very laid back.   All in all, it was a great place and I wouldn't mind if they brought a location to Orlando!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and reasonable pricing. Frantuary is a wonderful place to hang out with friends. Their hotdogs are a bit small but they have tasty desserts if you are still hungry after your main meal. The pickle spears were delicious!!"}
{"text":"What do you get when you combine chili dogs and Ginger beer, nervana. Oddly enought nervana is in the bacement of a church. Overall the food was great, the price was right, and the atmousphete was ironic. Defintaly the place for lunch or breakfast if your daring enougt for a dog covered in eggs."}
{"text":"Drinks are good here. But do not ask for a Bud light or a Coors Light. They don't carry them. They have plenty of craft beers that are way better than those. And lots of cool cocktails.
The poutine was excellent. You have to try it."}
{"text":"We had pretty good service but my whole family found the food to be ridiculously salty. The chips were covered with so much salt and seasoning that we had to wipe them off before eating them. Even the hot dogs were salty."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for one meal and I wasted it at this place.  First of all, this place is literally in a church basement...not in a cool way, its five feet from a cemetery.  I didn't see a legit piece of cooking equipment to speak of.  I trusted other reviews and gave it a chance....

I guess living in Brooklyn made me comfortable trying a quirky flavored hot dog. Places like crif dogs have great combos and they actually TASTE GOOD.  I tried the buffalo dog and expected more than a boiled hot dog with hidden valley ranch squirted all over it with some franks red hot on top.  It was disgusting.  My other hot dog was covered in CANNED chili.  A side of Perogis blasted in a microwave?!?!

Anyone who compares this place to hot dog joints in NYC or even Erie,pa is out of there mind.  

To top it off an employee decided that prime time lunch hour was a good time to empty the recycling bin.  He pulled each bottle and chucked it three feet to another bin full of glass.  It was an appropriate soundtrack for the horrific experience.

Church rec room+canned food+boiled hot dogs= a shitty lunch

Skipping lunch would have been a better option."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and usually don't like hot dogs but these were delicious! The place is super cute with a great young, local vibe. The sangria is deeeelish. Highly recommend it specially for vegan/vegetarians."}
{"text":"I'm going to eat 1000 hotdogs in a week to find out if they're kinda good for you, or REALLY good for you."}
{"text":"We stopped here because the place across the street had an hour & a half wait. Went out hoping for Italian and ended up at a hotdog place and we were not disappointed at all! 

Service was friendly and fast! Beers made it to the table lickity-split & the food wasn't far behind. M & I both ordered tofu dogs. I ordered the Italian version & M ordered Pittsburgh style. Both were good, but M made the better choice. It came covered in cole slaw with fried piergies stuffed in between dog and bun. 

We also ordered poutine (Canadian style), which was okay. I was delighted that it was vegetarian, I didn't care for the gravy. It was more grey than brown and too chunky to be right on poutine. It was salty and M liked it, so it must just be me. 

Finally we ordered the veggie balls -- veggie meatballs served in marinara sauce. We got them without cheese and they were delicious! I plan on ordering them on my next trip."}
{"text":"Sweet Baby Jesus, can't a girl please find decent poutine in Lawrenceville? I thought you'd be my savior Frankuary, instead you've left me totally confused and questioning my faith. 

Back in the day (college days to be specific) I loved the Frantuary. I am wondering if I was maybe just drunk? These days, I get really irritated when I cannot get a calorie free beverage aside from water in a restaurant. I honestly cannot tolerate drinking plain tap water with food and no, no I do not want your hipster Boylan's, OK?! I get it, you don't want me to die from terrible chemicals or high fructose corn syrup. But a Diet Pepsi MIGHT have made your blasphemous rip on poutine more tolerable. 

Probably not.  

Anyway, we ordered 2 plates of Poutine Québécois. It was bland and didn't have enough cheese curds. My friend stopped eating his after the curds were gone. Since there were 5 on his place, more than half the fries were left. I ate more of mine because I was hungry, but did not finish my plate (which is basically unheard of, as I am a glutton). Gravy was totally tasteless. No salt and tasted like it was thickened with corn starch. A really, really WEAK dish that needs to be totally reworked or taken off the menu. 

I don't know, I guess because my previous positive experiences, I would give Frankuary a chance to atone for their transgressions but no any time soon."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great atmosphere, friendly staff, delicious cocktails (specifically the HOLY COW), and outstandingly amazing weiners and pierogies! Looking forward to going back again and again :)"}
{"text":"The idea of fancy hotdogs didn't get me excited, but once I tried one, I was sold.

Don't bother building your own.  Go with one of their specialty dogs.  Best hot dogs I've ever had.  

Bartender Caitlin was friendly and a true professional.  

Great Place."}
{"text":"great place for a quick and cheap lunch.  i had the pittsburgh dog, which had 'smooshed' perogies with cole slaw.  definitely haven't had that before and it was really good.  also had the 'chicago imposter' dog which had yellow mustard, relish, onions, banana peppers, celery salt, tomatoes, and a pickle spear.  this was pretty good as well, just be ready for a mess when eating either of these.  the strawberry/banana fruit shake was also quite good as well.

the place itself is pretty interesting.  being in the basement of a church allowed for the creative name."}
{"text":"They have a really good kale salad there which there not known for, dressing was top notch even though their known for hotdogs I would go for their kale salad"}
{"text":"REALLY BAD WAITRESS! I wanted this place to be great and was excited to be there but as soon as we walked in the waitress who sat us made us feel very unwelcome and all around uncomfortable. She seemed very zoned out and not interested in the least bit in even pretending to give a shit about us. The other waiters and waitresses seemed great but I guess we got stuck with the bad one. I don't know who had the idea to stick this rude woman in a customer facing position but they need to retrain her or stick her in the back. Completely ruined the experience for me and our table of six making none of us even remotely interested in ever returning. I've worked in customer service positions for ten years and understand people have bad days and have never left a review before but I just felt I had to warn people about this, especially if you're going to be spending a decent amount of money on hot dogs and still have to tip your zombie waitress."}
{"text":"The Memphis Veggie Dog was good.  However, the sides are a rip off.  $3 for maybe a half cup of slaw is just ridiculous.  Stick to the dogs and avoid the sides."}
{"text":"Delicious hotgogs, get the garbanzo fries, and get their awesome cocktails. I had the church wine punch (it's probably not called that) it was like a mulled wine sangria.

Downside? My boyfriend whined about how hungry he still was afterwards. Don't go there expecting huge portions and don't have a cheap boyfriend."}
{"text":"Go there if you want to spend $21 for two hot dogs and fries.... I asked for a Diet Coke and the waitress looked at me like I was an alien before explaining that all their beverages were organic and made with blah blah blah.... Please remember that you're serving hot dogs, oh and the frites (fries) were basically crumbs.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Dinner on an otherwise ordinary Thursday night offered the following:

tasty dogs
creative topping combos
nicely cooked frites
delicious dipping sauces
crisp salad
great bar
inventive cocktails
quality beer selection

And the best part was the service. Our hostess was genuinely welcoming, nothing over the top, just friendly and warm. Our server saw similarly nice, not too showy but still polite and polished. He dealt with a food allergy concern by going straight to the source - the chef's recipe book - and providing a quick, definitive answer.

We went in with no expectations and wound up having a really nice time. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best hot dogs in the 'burgh. Extremely creative menu! Loved all the crazy toppings for them! Location is weird, but makes sense with the religious theme. Definitely worth the adventure to find! One of the best lunch spots downtown."}
{"text":"Incredible! Awesome service, great selection of various dog and non-dog items on menu. Went for brunch on a Sunday morning and got the Good Morning Frank. It was excellent! Prices were very reasonable! Will definitely be returning and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"All of the peripherals make it impossible not to recommend this place---great name, unique location, creative menu, bright open seating area.  Being from out of town, the local soda offerings in the cooler and local chips were refreshing.  The hot dog modifications on the menu were interesting and I would like to try all of them.  The wheat bun was especially good and helped hold all the toppings in.  The hot dog itself (the regular dog, not the premium) was just so so, kind of the afterthought to the sandwich.  For the price, I want that hot dog to be bigger, juicier, and tastier."}
{"text":"I'm just visiting Pittsburgh, and YUM. Had a Locavore Chicago Imposter today and will be going back to try more dogs tomorrow. Friendly folks, cool building and deeeeeeelicious food!"}
{"text":"Service was so-so, as was the food. The menu at this location is smaller than the Lawrenceville location, as well. I probably will not go back and would not recommend this location. Food prices were very reasonable, but the drink prices seemed a little high."}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning with friends.  Was not aware that location had brunch on Sunday. We were a little disappointed that they did not have more franks offered on brunch menu. However the menu items that did order off the brunch menu were very tasty. 

Server was friendly and had a very creative holiday light up belt on that was very festive for the holiday season."}
{"text":"Food was terrible. One of our hotdogs and the poutine tasted moldy. Very disappointed. Won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"Upscale hotdogs seems like quite a paradox but I decided to give Franktuary a try due to the availability of poutine as well as my dining partners affinity for hotdogs (get your mind out of the gutter).  Everyone I know who has had poutine has raved about it and, to my knowledge, this is the only place in Pittsburgh that is serving it up.

The setup of Franktuary is very open and there are quite a few tables which was great because we didn't wait to be seated.  There was a hipster ambiance to the place overall but I was already expecting that due to its location in Lower Lawrenceville.  The front window located near the bar doubled as a sort of garage door that had the ability to open up and would be a terrific place to post up for some sunny afternoon cocktails.  Unfortunately, I came here during a drowning January rain so I was unable to partake.  After looking at the cocktail/beer menu, I will have to keep this thought buried in the back of my head for a day with better weather as the cocktails looked like they would be excellent.

I ended up ordering the Poutine Quebecois and an \"Under Dog\" New Yorker Style (sweet onion sauce, kraut and brown mustard).   The food took longer than expected to come out which was surprising for hot dogs and fries but when it arrived it was still hot so I'll give them a pass on that.  The Poutine Quebecois was first up.  My first experience with this dish ended up with mixed emotions.  The parts of the fries with the gravy and cheese curds were amazing but I would have liked to see more of those ingredients on the rest of the portion of fries.  I'm still going to say it was quite delicious.  My dog was very tasty but at close to 4.50 a dog I wanted to be absolutely blown away.  Maybe I should have gone a little more adventurous with my toppings.

All in all, I think the food was pretty good and I'm going to rate this place 3 stars for the time being.  However, I will add that I will be returning to try the cocktails and possibly another style of dog in the future."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place and Lawrenceville! They have grass-fed options, all of the ingredients taste fresh and they even have kombucha on tap. Oh and with 4 guys who each got a ton of food the bill was only $45, cant beat that!"}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie sausage with chicago-style toppings and the fried pierogi appetizer. For a veggie dish, the sausage was very flavorful and a bit on the spicy side. I had a root beer float to wash it down, and even without being told they made their ice cream in-house I would have noticed; it's better than what you'd get at an ice cream shop. 

Franktuary is a nice place for a change-of-pace meal that is affordable and quick without sacrificing quality."}
{"text":"I don't really get the hype surrounding Franktuary. The inside is nice, the hot toddy was great, but the hot dog was shriveled and dry. And the bun-to-hot-dog ratio is all off. I want to like Franktuary, but I just wasn't impressed. The service was great, the interior was nice, the drinks were good, and the meal was so underwhelming that I probably won't go back. Writing this review has made me realize that I am actually angry at Franktuary for not giving me the hot dog nirvana I've always wanted."}
{"text":"This was, indeed, A-OK.  Service was pretty good, restaurant was clean.  Great draft/cocktail list, and I love how they open up the front of the place in warm weather.  Hot dogs are a little underwhelming for the price-- they taste good but the ratio of dog-to-bun is not high.  Meatballs are pretty tasty and garbanzo fries are excellent.  Definitely would visit again, especially because they have a parking lot!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times, mostly for lunch and mostly because I work nearby and this used to be the only place open on Mondays within walking distance (other than Wendy's and Subway).

In short, it's a pretentious, overpriced hotdog joint and the waiting staff seem to be selected by abundance of tattoos and piercings rather by any level of competence for or desire to do the job.

Thankfully for me, they are now closed on Mondays together with most of the neighboring businesses and I will probably never have to consider going there."}
{"text":"Nice location, better spot than the downtown restaurant. Nice bar and seating area, decent local craft selection, good cocktails, and well hotdogs."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu looked incredible. I ended up getting the miso kale salad because I was in dire need of vegetables, but I tasted some of my friend's hot dogs. All of it was so flavorful and unique. Even the fries were perfectly crispy. Best part of it all was how affordable it was! Great menu, great atmosphere, I will definitely be coming here again next time I visit Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. The food was fantastic and the service was excellent.

The brunch menu changes regularly, so check it out online before you go.

The vegan sasuage is amazing, and most dishes are complimented well with a fresh morning salad.   The drink menu is fun too.  Recommend the cold brew nitro coffee when its up and available.  Good kick-start to the day.  They'll spike it with Bailey's for you as well.

Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Franktuary has been me and my wife's go to place for late night and fast but delicious food options since they opened.  Although we love the poutine and recommend splurging for extra cheese curds, the menu is full of tasty options. They also have great specials, but they seemed to be a little quirky. They always have a shorter beer list of mostly local beers. The service is always top notch and I can't explain why, but they always seem to skillfully walk the attentive/aloof service line perfectly. Additionally, they have fountain Boylan sodas. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Thank you, Mike. We came from Greensburg because we heard about the place.
You were attentive and informative. Thank you for making the meal great for me my daughter and girlfriend."}
{"text":"Honestly- A little pricey for what you get. Now don't get me wrong, the hot dogs are good, but they should be a little less expensive. I got two italy hotdogs ( normal style hot dogs with cubes of mozzarella cheese and tomato on them) with a small bag of chips and it was close to $10 dollars! Thats with no drink too. I read great reviews about the locavore, but guess what...i'm not about to shell out $6+ for one hotdog. 
Point is the hot dogs are good, but if you are downtown where there are endless of eateries, why spend so much on a food that is so cheap to produce...I mean they price these dogs as if its at a ballgame. 

I'll go again, but not very often."}
{"text":"Slow service when we were one of three tables on Tuesday afternoon, the servers had plenty of time to stand in the back and text and flirt with the bartender though. Half of our food was cold and not cooked the entire way despite us having waited 25+ minutes for it, The remainder of our food was dry and gross after sitting in a window waiting to be delivered. Even after saying something about the abysmal food all we received was \"oh yeah, sorry\" and the server walked away."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a friend.

The decor is okay and it wasn't too crowded which was nice.

My main complaint with this place is it is way too expensive.  The cocktail list is the same price as somewhere upscale like Salt - the cheapest was $9.  I don't really think of expensive cocktails as really going with hot dogs and pierogies but okay.   My friend got Arsenal Cider though and they charged $7.50 for a glass.  You can refill your growler up the street for like $14...I thought that was kind of insane.

The positive is the vegetarian options.  They have Field Roast Sausages which are the best faux meat product around - far superior to the veggie dogs that they serve at Station Street.  I got it New York style which wasn't my favorite - wish I had something else.  We got the poutine to split which was okay, but I don't think it was spectacular.  

One Big Hop, a veggie sausage, and poutine to split ran me $16.11.  I might go back here, but I'd probably suggest getting guac and cheaper drinks at Round Corner instead."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time recently. Had the Boylan Birch Beer, surprisingly good. Comparable to a Sabrett of sorts. Great condiments too. Not sure what to make of the gummy bear. 

All in all, decent and a great value."}
{"text":"I cant believe anyone would say anything at all bad about this place.  The absolute perfect hot dog stop.  I get pineapple mango on my dogs."}
{"text":"I loved the Chicago Style hotdog! The fries were fresh and delicious! Good beer selection and great atmosphere. I'll be back to try some cocktails!"}
{"text":"BEST best BEST place to eat lunch Downtown.  
1. great hot dogs
2. FRUIT SHAKES!!! It is near impossible to find a smoothie in Pittsburgh - this place blends real fruit into drinks
3. amazing chips that they import from the west coast
4. free wireless

Tim and Megan are great.  This is a great local business everyone should add to their lunch schedule."}
{"text":"The Franktuary truck is parked next to the  Gateway Two building for the Art Festival. The young lady at the truck was beyond friendly and nice as she handled the orders. My two standard hotdogs were perfect. Try the hot sauce, it was just right. If you see this truck parked make a special effort, you won't regret it. If you are a hotdog lover check them!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was pretty neat but we went for lunch and were there for over an hour only eating a hot dog and French fries. Over 30 minutes to wait for a hot dog that by any means was not gourmet is way too long. I was not expecting to get such a teeny tiny hot dog either. Although our waiter was nice the service overall was very very very slow from the time we sat til the time we left. And we all left hungry."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times and always enjoyed the food. Last night I went to the bar with a few friends to grab a quick drink. There were 2 customers at the bar. 3 employees behind the bar. I waited several minutes for the bartender to finish his personal conversation. After finally being greeted, he then gave me a draft list after I had to ask for it. I ordered quickly and waited several more mins for him to pour my drink. In the meantime I watched him touch his hair multiple times, then touch his face. Then only to touch my glass several times to keep topping it off. Never once stopping to wash his hands. I am a bartender myself. I have never yelped anyone. I was okay with having to wait 20 mins for my friends and I to get 3 drinks. But I was not okay with the constant touching of the face and hair. Seriously that is a major no no and quite disgusting. I did not pay $9 a drink for a side of his sweat and body oils. I sincerely hope the management sees this review and addresses the issue."}
{"text":"Eh.

Service was irritating -- Addie was unfriendly, often reaching past our eating faces to grab a dirty plate. The hostess had a constant smirk - I bestowed upon finishing one's MFA, no doubt - and the portions were tiny. 

The food was tasty and well seasoned, especially the perfect mache salad.

Compared to Gus's or Industry (the list could go on...) this place falls short of the mark.

Will not return."}
{"text":"I've had 3 additional visits to Franktuary and I'm afraid there have been no improvements since it first opened. I will echo what others have said and say that the Poutine is tasteless and bland. The gravy has no flavor and there are almost no cheese curds. 

As I've said before the presentation of the hot dogs needs work. The buns are bland and overpower the hot dog and the ingredients.

I had really high hopes for this place but every time I leave still feeling hungry and like I didn't come anywhere close to getting my money's worth. 

Although they don't serve Hot Dogs I would strongly suggest going to Remedy for much better bar/finger food."}
{"text":"I didn't have a great experience. I won't be back. But maybe it was just a bad night. The food was good, but the attitude we got was out of place. They have hot dogs. They act like they're doing you a favor serving you hot dogs."}
{"text":"I like franktuary for what it is.  It's not fine dining, and it's not really a foodie joint which is going to blow you away with something exotic. It's a chill place to go have a drink and a snack.

They have good, moderately priced hot dogs with interesting toppings. There is more of a selection here than 'D's six packs and dogs' and cheaper than 'Station Street' dogs. I appreciate the premium grass fed beef dogs. They cater well to vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free customers.  

It's got a small bar area, which is great when you're stopping in solo, or just want to have a drink.  The beer selection is small, but generally interesting.  The cocktails list is top notch. 

My service here has always been pleasant. The atmosphere is not overly loud like some bars, there are no televisions, and the open garage doors facing butler street are a nice touch.  It's a welcome addition to the lower lawrenceville area."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it. I love the concept and vegan hotdog options elsewhere... So terribly bland, soggy, and both raw (the hotdogs) and over cooked within an inch of being bricks (the pierogis). I ordered the Chicago and Pittsburgh specialty vegan dogs and wow... Unbelievably awful on both counts."}
{"text":"Very good food with a great vegetarian options.  Love the poutine which I had after a long time.  Loved the Texan toppings.  Must try at least once."}
{"text":"Absolutely off the chain good. Vegetarian and vegan options available! Staff is pretty friendly as well."}
{"text":"It was great to see the Franktuary food truck at the Pink Steel / Brest Cancer Dragon Boat Festival in North Park today!!

  I read about Franktuary on the Pedalpgh websight, and I have ridden past the Market Square and Lawrenceville locations, but never tried the place. 

My loss!  Should have tried it much sooner!
Since I was going for a bike ride I between dragon boat races, I kept it simple and less messy with a basic dog with mustard and some of the sweet hot mustard mix and that was the best dog I've ever had!  

I will definitely hit the Lawrenceville location soon!  

Great dog, good service, and a personable guy that waited on me and seemed to have. Passion for what he was doing!!"}
{"text":"So excited to try because I LOVE hot dogs. The dogs are really good, and you can create your own if the menu options don't spark your interest. The corn dog was alright (I like a slightly sweeter cornmeal breading) but the Pittsburgher comes topped with a pierogi and is awesome! I'd recommend for lunch or Thursday nights (bingo + BOGO dogs)."}
{"text":"We ordered the Texan and another (has onions, spicy mustard, & sauerkraut), with one being a \"meal deal\". A meal deal is $8 for a hot dog, drink (free refills), and fries. We upgraded the fries to a mini poutine - gravy and cheese curds. 
Nothing stuck out here. Nothing blew my mind with flavor. The hotdogs tasted slightly overcooked. Though I will give them props for getting long hotdogs and not using the smaller sized ones. The cheese curds on the fries were the highlight... And let's be real, it's cheese! Everything was just overall a bland, nothing memorable kind of food. 
Tiny place with a few places to sit and a bar that can seat about 8. I don't think I'll come back."}
{"text":"I came here after being recommend several times.  Now I'm not a huge hot dog fan - I'll enjoy one a few times a year at most, but after hearing so many rave reviews, I decided to give it a try.

I got their standard Mexico dog - a hotdog topped with mango and pineapple salsa, guacamole and cheddar cheese, as well as chips and an iced tea.  The whole thing was less than $10.

The hot dog bun was AMAZING.  It was soft and chewy and slightly sweet.  The hot dog had a slight snap to it, the guacamole was smooth and with chunks of onion, and the salsa was slightly sweet.  I didn't really taste the cheese, which was shredded on top.

The chips were kettle chips, very crunchy, but the iced tea wasn't great - I couldn't get the sugar to mix into it because it was so cold.  There were two tea options - regular and herbal mint - but they were out of the mint when I went in.

All in all, it was a really good meal and I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Overpriced hot dogs and Food! Not worth the money and very small portions for the money you will spend. I ordered a kielbasa on a bun for 8 bucks! The thing was the dry and tasteless..  If you want a good hot dog or hot sausage go directly to Frankie's in lawrencevile. Prices are great food is great and they have been around forever!"}
{"text":"Never knew a hot dog could be so good!! i highly recommend the poutine. Super happy hour deals from 4-6, and now serving Jack!!! Woo Hoo"}
{"text":"I ate here almost everyday that I was in town for a 3 day conference because they had the cheapest vegan options within a mile distance from the Convention Center. Honestly, the service and space is very laid back and chill but the real winner is how great their hot dogs are - I'd recommend the vegan dog with vegan chili with a side of fries. They also have free wifi and a decent amount of seating, but I'd suggest taking your food to go."}
{"text":"The place is magnificent. Eating a hot dog at Franktuary is like watching Jesus rise from the dead."}
{"text":"Almost drooled on the counter looking at the menu items. Closed my eyes, pointed, wasn't disappointed. I don't think it's possible to choose wrong. 
Friendly service. Nice atmosphere. 
TVs with the sportsballs. Small bar. 
I'd give it a 4.5 if i could. Minus a half point because i think $8 is a little much for a dog, a soft drink, and an order of fries. It's downtown and they have to pay the rent somehow though."}
{"text":"Checked their website and it said they were open until 3 on Sunday. Arrived at 2:40. Was told they did not seat people after 2:45. I pointed out it was only 2:40 and we'd be out the door by 3. He responded \"Sorry dude.\" We won't be back."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a couple beers but checked out the menu and had food envy at what other people were ordering.   I was a regular at the old location in the basement of the church,  so the new location took some getting used to.   They have great local beers on tap and the menu inspired me to come back some day for lunch.   Bar service was slow, but maybe it improves during happy hour 4:30-6:30 when all drinks are half off?"}
{"text":"I'm always hoping for something a little bit better here, but ultimately always get my hopes up in comparison to the now closed Station Street.

Standard dogs typically come out room temperature which is unfortunate as they lose some of the crisp. Their version of the Hawaii dog, the \"Oahu\" is decent, but the teriyaki doesn't match well with the smoked bacon. Their rolls were a little stiff and not effectively grilled.

Fries pale in comparison to some local counterparts and their homemade ketchup, albeit cold and refreshing, just tastes like canned tomato to me. I'm a Heinz kinda guy.

Prices are reasonable and service is always fine, and indefinitely want to try their brunch.  Worth a quick lunch but could use some improvement on the basics."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim with some friends.  My vegan friend had been pushing me to try this place for the last month.  We went on a Saturday just a few minutes after opening; no wait.  The restaurant space is gorgeous --- its spacious with lots of natural sunlight and feels incredibly homey.  I got the Pennsylvania High Tea and the Under Dog Bollywood style (I was torn btwn Negishi and Bangkok).  We also shared the Poutine le Frank - ah, cheese curds!!  Each hot dog is strategically well dressed with their named condiments --- beautiful presentation.  I'm not a fan of soggy french fries --- I don't ever use ketchup and prefer fries crunchy, lightly salted and thats it.  But I did find the cheese curds yummy and my friends enjoyed the Poutine le Frank - we finished every sopping wet spud straw.  I would go back to try their Sunday brunch.  The beetballs, church wine punch, and pierogis were other menu items that caught my eye.  But I've reserved my pierogi binges on the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern happy hour on Fri/Sats and the popular underground monthly \"Pierogi Nights\" hosted by Apteka --- find on Facebook --- an amazing monthly meal --- I am looking forward to their future restaurant space."}
{"text":"NEVER HAD A BAD TIME HERE! MOSTLY BECAUSE FUNNEL CAKES ARE AWESOME!

Hi my loves!

So I've come here a couple of times with friends to grab a late night bite to eat or just in a hurry and don't wanna wait forever to get a table elsewhere. 

They have interesting cocktails as well as interesting hotdog combos. I had a poutine special with sausage gravy one night and it was to die for! Some of the hotdog combos are not so hot. The best I have had is a Pittsburgh dog with a pierogi on top! The pierogi appetizer is good too. 

I'm a sucker for the funnel cake dessert here! Def a late night treat ... that's contributing to my booty-lishes-ness! HA!

Love you!

{"text":"Lunchtime adventure across the river into dahntan!!   I had my eye on Franktuary for a long time!   11:40 arrival during the work week.  I was surprised how small the size was of the market square location.  There was a line about 8 people deep - almost out the door.  As I approached the counter, I realized there was only two people working!  They were working hard and needed help for the lunch rush.  It was a longer wait than I anticipated and we even arrived early.  We were able to get the last two seats available along the counter by the window and by that time - the line was out the door.  We only had to wait a few minutes for our food.  I ordered the Chicago Imposter (Grass fed). It was quite a small hotdog but delicious.  I decided on the regular fries- they were ok -forgettable and the portions were small.  My friend ordered the New Yorker (standard) and it was a little longer.   It was nice visit.  Thanks Franktuary! 

Warm shout out to my buddy Danny B!  - who was an excellent getaway driver during our lunchtime adventure!"}
{"text":"It seems like a little bit, but it's actually filling. The hot dog was generally nice with the added touch of condiments, and the poutine wasn't oily and heavy."}
{"text":"Recently came for brunch and had a great time. The menu is limited - there were 4 main dishes, and it seems that an a la carte option of eggs, toast, bacon, etc could be put together. In the end, it was something of a relief to have just a few options in today's standard of so many choices.  (Though it was great that the dishes could be made with meatless proteins as well). We had the breakfast poutine, the stuffed grape leaves omelette, and crepes. Side salads with locally foraged greens, including edible flowers, took the meal to another level. Everyone enjoyed their selections, and mimosas and kombucha added a little extra kick. A little pricey to be a regular option for me (while still being a good value), but it was a fun thing to treat my folks to."}
{"text":"You can't put a silk blouse on a pig. 

My girlfriend and I eat out in the Burgh very often and are always looking for places to find another great dining experience. 

We've driven past Frantuary enough times to stop in one night after the a concert. 

She said \"Hey how about a snack, what about Frantuary?\" as we drove past the restaurant on Butler. What sounded like a good idea became a very lackluster experience.

I'm a vegetarian and my girl eats beef (no pun intended) so she ordered the house dog, I opted for the veggie sausage. 

For $5.50, I expected this sausage would be a decent size. I ordered it with the onion/pepper sauteed medley with spicy brown mustard. She had the beef dog with cheddar and chili. Both on a potato bun and we both shared some frites. 

Yum...until the food came. 

This veggie dawg was the smallest sausage I ever saw. 3 bites and it was done. It was like they opened a package of veggie dogs from Whole Foods and threw it on a bun. 

They are called Hot Dogs for a reason but mine was luke warm. My girls dog was also barely warm and tasted like it was boiled. 

Unsatisfied we mulled the thought of ordering another dog each but decided against it. Its not worth the price, we spent over $20 + tip and I felt ripped off, imagine if we were having another dog plus a few beers. We could easily be over the $50 mark. 

Ridiculous. 

I'm from NY, where hot dogs are cheap and of a decent size and is grilled to a juicy perfection. They are not over priced and served in ceramic bowls with forks. 

I want my hot dog in a paper boat, and a greasy mustard dispenser, maybe its just me but one day someone will get it right and open a hot dog spot that actually sells hot dogs and not some lame yuppy hipster hangout."}
{"text":"What a delightfully bizarre little place!

Arriving in Pittsburgh after an 8 hour MegaBus ride, I was starving my vegetarian ass off.  A little dabbling on Yelp in the moments prior to de-coaching led me to Franktuary -- a hipster hot dog joint INSIDE A CHURCH.  Who knew?

I kept it simple with a New York Style vegetarian hot dog.  All the components were there, were delicious, and quickly found their way into my belly.  A gummy hot dog accompanied my meal which was a fun, cheeky surprise.  Coming from NYC the prices seemed average to good, but perhaps a little high for Pittsburgh?

As far as the space goes, it's pretty utilitarian and there's not much in the way of atmosphere, but it was homey and comfortable and the folks behind the counter were quite pleasant.  

Overall this is a great lunch spot to get your dog on.  If I ever find myself in Pittsburgh again I will surely return."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times since it's opened.  The first couple of times were just great.  The food was good, there was a fun draft selection and the servers were splendid.  Then we came here on a busy Friday night and all went downhill.  We sat at the last two seats at the bar.  We got drinks in a reasonable amount of time however we waited an obscene amount of time for food.  As a former waitress it really takes a lot for me to flag someone down but I eventually got a waitress to check on our food and she brought it out immediately.  We were probably waiting upwards of an hour and half for four hotdogs.  When we got our food my veggie dogs were cold, not lukewarm but cold.  I've never sent food back at a restaurant but these were not suited for human consumption.  I had my husband try it too and he confirmed I didn't have a choice but to send them back.  After about 15 minutes the bartender came over and asked how things were and I confessed my hotdogs were cold and requested that they just throw them in the microwave for a couple of minutes.  The bartender was ridiculously nice about it all and apologized profusely.  About 25 minutes later replacement veggie dogs were brought to me and they were totally fine.  Mind you I was pretty drunk by this point because I'd been sitting at a bar for about 2 hours and had planned to eat about an hour and 15 minutes ago so that was also pretty annoying to me.  Ohhh and I nearly forget, my husband ordered poutine that never came.  Thankfully we weren't charged for the poutine or the two veggie dogs that had to go back.  I can't really figure out what the problem here is.  The staff is great and seem to be totally competent but the food service is a problem.  Maybe they have a bad kitchen staff?  Whatever the reason we're done with this place.  I wish them well and would recommend it to others but after this one bad experience I have no interest in returning.  There are too many other restaurants in the area that I like to spend any more money here."}
{"text":"Good times at Franktuary! Interesting menu..I had the Oahu hot dog with bacon and pineapple..delicious!! Excellent service and a great setting for our happy hour event :) Love the fresh cut Fries too!"}
{"text":"Make sure you specify your order and carefully read your receipt as I ordered a BLT dog that never made it to my order despite the worker repeating it back to me. 

Food here is pretty mediocre. Tried half a Pittsburgh dog which had no flavor and served on a cheap him that fell apart. Poutine was decent at least. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Expensive little hotdogs they are! But pretty good. Some good choices for \"gourmet\" hotdogs. It's a small place in the basement of a church, so there aren't quite enough tables if you happen to go during a busy lunch time. They have some silly paintings hanging up that are amusing. There is a parking garage about a block away, since finding parking in that area is near impossible."}
{"text":"Love this place. The only con I will say is I think it's a little overpriced for hot dogs, but that's it. Otherwise the staff is super friendly and helpful, the bar is amazing as well. I live around the corner and I tend to occasionally go there for drinks. Try the Sweet Wheat. It's not on the menu anymore, but I think that's the because the drink menu changes. Just ask for it."}
{"text":"Do you love hotdogs? That amazing shlong of processed mystery meats? That discolored stick of tender whatsit?

I know I love a good hotdog. And the Franktuary has the best dogs in the city, and easily so. They pile a crap load of toppings on your dog, and they are crisp and freshly cooked for your eating pleasure. 

Make sure to get two- one just isn't enough. Trust me."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Sunday. The drinks were unique and delicious and the food was the same. Great start to your day in Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"My stomach, my palate, and hot dogs have at best what could be described as an abusive relationship.  My love of chili, cheese, jalapeno hot dogs hurts so good.

So if you love hot dogs and are in pittsburgh missing a Chicago style hot dog, a New York style dog, or a Texas chili cheese dog then Franktuary is the place to go."}
{"text":"Very good spot... quick service... great dogs....
Nice to have a mixed drink with my favorite hot dog.... very cool menu at reasonable prices"}
{"text":"This was the 2nd time I had visited Franktuary and let me tell you, I was not disappointed. My boyfriend and I went last night around 7:30pm and only had to wait 10 minutes to get a table. We sat at the bar while we waited; I ordered an old fashioned which was sweeter than usual, but very good. The atmosphere was great..not too crowded, but definitely bumping. They have a garage door that opens up. allowing you to people watch on Butler St. and soak in the warm weather.

We started with the Poutine Texan which consisted of fries, cheddar cheese, and chili. They loaded on the toppings and seriously, can you really go wrong with loaded chili cheese fries? For dinner, we ordered 4 different hot dogs to share. The great thing about these gourmet hot dogs is that you can choose the type of meat (veggie dogs are an option), the type of bread (I went with the potato bun but there are gluten free buns too), and any sort of additional toppings that you want. 

We chose the \"Buffalo\", \"Pittsburgh, \"Texan\", and having eaten hotdogs on our recent trip to Iceland we had to try the \"Reykjavik\". My favorite was definitely the \"Buffalo\"...it was topped with bleu cheese dressing, wing sauce, and diced celery. It was a little spicy, but not so much that you couldn't taste the rest of the hot dog. The \"Reykjavik\" was tasty, but not the same as the infamous hot dogs that are served in Reykjavik, Iceland. 

I would recommend Franktuary to couples, groups of friends, and even families with children (because what kid doesn't love a good hot dog?). The prices of the dogs were very reasonable..their cocktails were a little pricy, but that's to be expected. This is a great place to grab a meal or maybe even to wander in for a late night snack after enjoying some of the nightlife on Butler St. (they're open till 1am on Friday's and Saturday's)."}
{"text":"Was just going through bookmarks and saw that I never reviewed it. I think I meant to come back and try something else, because my first time was really disappointing. 

Poutine quebecois... was flavorless, as I had seen in some reviews but I hoped it was a fluke. I asked for extra gravy because many places don't seem to give enough, and it was so bland. The cheese curds were and fries were good, but just drowned in blandness. It could have used some salt, but I don't think seasoning would have helped... Sigh.

I also had the salmon dog with thai toppings, and while the flavors were nice, the salmon frank was a bit dry. 

Am very interested in trying a more traditional dog but in the mean time I think I have to write this as a note-to-self and caution for others about that disappointing poutine. 

Friendly staff. Garage door was open when I went, and the gorgeous weather made for a great dining environment."}
{"text":"Great concept, great food. Super casual and also fantastic happy hour specials. Their specialty hot dogs are great... Anyone can throw a bunch of random toppings on a hot dog, but what separates this place is the hot dog itself is perfectly cooked with great flavor. The traditional poutine is a little salty. Good combo pricing."}
{"text":"The hotdogs and drinks are delicious, the brunch not so much. I have been for Tuesday trivia night which was a lot of fun. When I heard they started serving brunch I thought hotdogs for breakfast why not! Just kidding and to my disappointment they did not even have the option to order a hot dog. The menu was very unique and had nice options to choose from however they were pricey. I went with the pick three option and you could choose from a variety of sides or small portions of most of the entrees. I went with the bacon which was fantastic, the parfait of the day which was not to my liking and beignets which were so so. The apple dipping sauce added some flavor to the beignets which were very bland. When I think of parfait I think sweet and this one had tons of chopped up red beets at the bottom which did not go well with the rest of the ingredients and the strong flavor took over. We went with a large party and our orders took a long time to be served. A few others in my party weren't thrilled with their meal and the portions were small. Stick with the hotdogs when going here."}
{"text":"The room is spatious and colored, with large tables that can easily accommodate parties of 6-7 people. Very nice choice of beers, including some local ones (two thumbs up). 

sadly, the food was quite mediocre. The poutine was lukewarm (and a lukewarm poutine is not that enjoyable) and the fries were not excellent, the sausage on the top of it was dry and not very tasty. The side portion of fries that some of our party got was real small. I did not like the pierogies either (rubber like). Some seemed to like their dogs, though...

considering that the food is not cheap, i will avoid this place in the future."}
{"text":"A definite go to. (veggie) Dogs were actually better than D's, which is saying ALOT. We made reservations, which I suggest, just because ya never know. They had a decent, diverse tap selection, and also advertised the craft bottles. I strayed from the norm, and had the falafel sandwich. Ah-mazing. It came out in a hot dog bun, which makes sense. The sauce on top tied the delicious falafel balls in with the hot peppers scattered on top. Also, ordered a side of fries with garlic aioli. Hello! I could bath in that stuff. Definitely ask for extra, or at least a side of it when you order fries, no matter which kind. The entire party thoroughly enjoyed their meals, and we will be returning. Service was also excellent. Thanks Franktuary for living up to expectation."}
{"text":"Top-notch!  Cool and relaxed atmosphere, excellent food and great mixology.  Friendly bartenders served us great Poutine (we have been to Quebec frequently and this is good!).  Their local sausage was awesome and the house made corn dog was the best with pork belly!"}
{"text":"Came here just to try the Poutine and have a couple drinks with a friend and my niece on a recent trip to Pitt.  My 2 star rating is on the poutine only.  The restaurant itself was a very cool place, with a  cool modern design and menu.  The server was super friendly and the drinks we had were really good.  I had a Pico sour here for the first time and I loved it!!  So the restaurant, ambiance and service were 4 stars.  

The Poutine......

They had a couple versions of poutine to choose from other than the traditional gravy and cheese curds that had other toppings like the Philly had sauce and peppers I think.  We tried the traditional Quebec style poutine and I was so excited to eat it but as soon as it arrived I knew it wasn't going to be good.  Why you ask??.....well the traditional gravy is just that a smooth brown beef gravy and if you look at the picture it looked and tasted nothing like that.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  Not sure what the flavor was or if they had just down right ruined the sauce and served it anyway.  We ate maybe half between the 3 of us but no one was impressed and I think it sat in all of our stomachs in a bad way.  

If we ever go back to Pitt we might just try a different poutine or just stick with what they are good at the hot dogs lol!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at both the Lawrenceville location and the now closed Market Square location dozens of time. First off I love them both. Always friendly, courteous, quick,  clean, and delicious. As a Vegan it's tough to find many good options around the city at times. That being said the Vegan sausage is excellent! Always well cooked and great with their amazing Veg. chili. The tofu dog on the other hand isn't as good, but being a tofu dog it's about what if expect and is still something I get often, particularly with the very tasty Bangkok style toppings. The fries have always been fresh, and have been cooked and seasoned really well. My only issue with is around the cost. A Vegan bun is a $1 up charge, so after a $6.75 V. Sausage with .75 cent V. Chili you're looking at over $8 just for one. I can't say it's terribly priced but for a grown man who typically puts down two of these with fries and maybe a beer you're looking at a decent bill for dinner.
Still with the good and the so so, I still very much love this business and highly recommend it. 
Oh and as for their meat options, I've taken many clients, family, and friends here and I've heard nothing but good things. Go check this place out for sure!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. The food was just ok. Not worth the price. The food truck guys were not very efficient."}
{"text":"Initially when I heard \"high end hot dog place\" from a friend I was not thrilled about the restaurant choice, but WOW I was wrong. Being Gluten-Free I always am thrilled to find a place that accommodates me, not makes me accommodate them. They had plenty gluten-free options, including beer and hot dog bun! The only reason this doesn't have 5 stars was the service. Our waitress forgot about us and we were her only table, we only knew she forgot because after waiting 10 minutes for her to take our drink order she came over and said \"I totally forgot about having a table, it's hard when it's slow.\" Otherwise the food and atmosphere was very hip!"}
{"text":"Great hot dogs, helpful staff, great drinks at a reasonable price. I had the Reykjavik hot dog. Just being in Iceland in December and eating the original Reykjavik hot dog, this was the next best thing. They also serve Poutine. I'll definitely return to Franktuary for the same great food and se"}
{"text":"Went with my husband and one year old. Super family friendly, even with the bar being right there. Not something we've found with a lot of our favorite places in pgh. Our server was really friendly to the babe and oh also the Icelandic style hot dog was SO GOOD. Reminded me of being in Iceland again!"}
{"text":"What a fine place in dine in! It is rare situation to go to a restaurant with a group of mixed friends- and by mixed I mean meat eaters and veggies :) - and for all parties be happy with the quality of the food. I didn't realize that this place was so vegetarian friendly until I went out on a Friday night with some coworkers. The place was so awesomely designed that it feels upscale but also laid back at the same time. The people who work there know their stuff and are great at making suggestions- and I ended up getting the veggie sausage and chili- and everything was scrumptious. Coupled with a good beer selection and a few great whiskeys on the menu, this is a great place to get your booze and food on. The one not-so-good surprise for me was that the place was actually pretty quiet.... on a Friday night.  It's quite possible that things get a bit more interesting later in the night, but it did seem that the focus was more on the food and restaurant rather than the bar- which is great- however the next time I go I'd like to go a little later to make sure to be there when the action happens."}
{"text":"There was unexpected goodness coming from this visit to this establishment.  While going to a restaurant to only get a hot dog is not usually my thing I'm glad I made the choice in this occasion. I got the standard with some topping chili and the fries to go along with it, the dog was good, the fries are crisp and the chili had the right amount of spicy to it. And then you add the nice selection of beers that they have on hand most of which have a local flavor, meaning from local breweries this was an excellent experience. 
I think I'm definitely going to take a trip back to this place while I'm still here in Pittsburgh if not for another hotdog it would be to try the kielbasa that they have on the menu to see how that fares.
For those that are interested in something a little different they also have poutine on their menu and a couple salad options as well."}
{"text":"As someone who cannot have any dairy or anything else fun, Franktuary was amazing. Not only do they have some really great frank combinations, but they have so many options to appeal to everybody needs. The waitress was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the ingredients that went into their food. I got the Texan and Buffalo franks, with no dairy which was perfect.

Their vegan ranch is to die for, as crazy as that sounds. The vegan ranch anywhere else is revolting, but I love the vegan ranch at Franktuary more than real ranch."}
{"text":"Nothing special. I had two of the pre-configured dogs. standard. The texan & the Baja. The star rating description says exactly what I felt. meh. The dog itself was nicely cooked. Crisp skin, tasty, but small. The bun was fresh. The toppings were uneventful. In order for them to warrant the prices they charge, their dogs would have to be better than the others I've eaten. I'll give them another shot someday. Maybe try their perogies and configure my own toppings."}
{"text":"How do you get away with charging $8 for an order of french fries?  Open a hipster joint and call them by a fancy foreign name.  How does 'poutine' sound?  A nice French foerign ring to it, eh?  At any other restaurant a plate of fries with a tiny scoop of chili and a few cheese crumbles would cost about $2.95.  And you know the hot dogs they sell at gas stations - the ones in the glass-enclosed griller gizmos - the hot dogs that have turned so long on the hot pipes they've been transformed into dessicated meat cylinders?  Well, that's what our hot dogs were like; overcooked is an understatement. And what kind of place serves hot dogs without having some mustard on the table?  We had to ask and were brought a tiny steel cup of the stuff.  Come on, mustard is not that expensive.  I guess we should feel lucky we weren't charged extra.  

My suggestion?  If you want a good hot dog (instead of a gourmet 'experience') find a decent coney: you'll have better food and save money."}
{"text":"If you are going to charge a premium price for hot dogs, you had better get everything right. Any fool can buy decent, high quality hot dogs at their local butcher or even most big name grocery chains now.... and cooking a hot dog isn't exactly difficult, so to make a business like this worth walking into for me, you need the following:
1 - a hot dog I can't get elsewhere.
2- good quality bun, preferably more than one type
3- a wide variety of toppings, all top quality

Franktuary gets none of this right. You have 3 hot dog choices: vegetarian, regular beef, or locally grown organic beef. The regular beef frank  is $2.90 with no toppings, and the organic beef is $5.30 plain!?!?!? I paid under $5 for an organic, locally sourced lamb hot dog with toppings at a ballpark in Frederick, MD - and that hot dog was handed to me, and prepared by, Bryan Voltaggio of Top Chef. Right off the bat, this place struck me as overpriced, but I figured I'd dive in anyway.

The bun is your standard, bland, mainly only there as a holster for the hot dog type of bun. Their toppings - mostly just sad. They seem to shop for the majority of their toppings in the condiment aisle of the grocery store. The chili tasted like it was canned, the saurkraut tasted about the same, and the blue cheese dressing not only tasted prepackaged, it tasted like horribly cheap prepackaged dressing.

The nail in the coffin for me was the Pittsburgh dog, topped with pierogie and cole slaw. In case you don't know, pierogies have been a staple Pittsburgh food forever, so if you're going to sell them, they had better be good. These were not. I don't know if they were prepackaged (if they were, SHAME ON YOU Franktuary! You can by fresh ones at church bake sales in Pittsburgh for goodness sake), but mine were hard around the edges where they had obviuosly been precooked and then reheated, most likely in a microwave. 

Just avoid this place. It's simply not worth their ridiculous markup. Go to your local grocery store, buy some good quality hot dogs and rolls, and for the $30 you'll save by not going to Franktuary, you can top them with lobster if you want and still have change."}
{"text":"Franktuary is a welcome addition to the growing Butler Ave district in Lawrenceville.  Its atmosphere is half-bar, half-cosy restaurant with the exposed brick and mix of old and new that is popular in the loft apartments in the neighborhood.  There is a good list of cocktails and beers on draft and in bottles.  The menu focuses on various gourmet dogs, sausages, meatballs, and varieties of french fries (including poutine and garbanzo fries).  Pierogies and vegetarian versions of all of the above are on there too.  

I found the atmosphere, service, cocktails, and piergoies to be great, but the hot dogs and french fries were fairly lackluster.  I'd recommend going there for drinks (and some appetizers) before or after eating at one of the other dining options nearby.  It does have large tables that make it easy for a large group to eat or drink together, so if you have a bunch of friends looking for somewhere reasonably inexpensive (and have vegetarians or vegans in the bunch), it might be worth the tradeoff incurred by eating the main courses of food."}
{"text":"I need to update my previous review and let everyone know that the happy hour specials have changed. Gone are the days of half off drinks. These days, the specials are $1 off libations and $2 off local drafts and bottles. From what I can remember, I also saw the addition of $4 mini poutines and $2 fried cheese curds as part of their specials. While these are still specials, it's not quite the same deal anymore. I will most likely still be back because even though the specials changed, the beers are still a good deal and it's still a decent place for drinks."}
{"text":"I used to love Franktuary's downtown location. I stopped in the other day for a quick dog but was really surprised to find a remodeled restaurant... but not in a good way.

The walls and tables used to be colorful and added life to the room. Now, in keeping with their name, everything has been replaced with church pews and an accompanying hushed and stale air. Even the self-serve condiments are gone from the pick up counter. The room is now empty and lifeless. Where is the comment board full of drawings, suggestions, and responses? Where is the color? Where is any splash of excitement? I'm not even sure any music was playing.

Don't get me wrong, the dogs are still delicious. The atmosphere is just terrible now. I can't help but think that the downtown location has fallen by the wayside in the wake of the more popular Lawrenceville location.

I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is just awful and in no way worthy of ANY of the hype. 
I am to understand this is based on the downtown location in some church? Ugh! Already, that makes me sick to my stomach. I walk in and see church decor - strike No. 1. The hotdogs are disgusting. They have almost no flavor - toppings, included - and they're those generic, thin hotdogs, not the thick kind you would expect should you be going to a restaurant specializing in hot dogs. On top of this, they don't offer any sides along with your hotdogs (I.E.two hotdogs and a side of salad, fries, chips, etc.) No, forget it. Everything is extra - as is the case with these indie restaurants. This is yet another independent restaurant that fails miserably here in Pittsburgh. I will gladly stick with the chain restaurants. And yes, you can make a far better hotdog for far less $$ at home."}
{"text":"Good food in a super pretentious atmosphere. My husband and I come here for poutine and inventive hot dogs, and we're almost always happy, as we've only had bad service once (out of at least a half dozen times) and have never had bad food. We always get excited when we see their truck out at local events. 

My husband is a huge fan of the Reykjavik and Oahu dogs, and I love the Chicago Imposter and Bangkok dogs! I'm a poutine purist, so I haven't tried the \"fancy\" kinds, but I love their original gravy & curds variety. 

Sit next to the window if you can for excellent people-watching."}
{"text":"Whenever my husband and I are on a road trip, we love finding good, unique hot dog joints. This place takes the cake! Upon entry, we checked in with the hostess who, after asking for our name, asked for our phone number. She let us know that instead of making us stand with a buzzer, they simply send you a text message on your phone! This is such a great concept, and gave us the ability to walk around outside while we waited for our table!

We started out with the Poutine Québécoise and a Curd Kebab. Their cheese curds are to die for! We ordered the garlic ailoi dipping sauce for our fried curds and could not have been more pleased! My husband ordered the Texan style hot dog (per the hostess' suggestion!) and I ordered the Pittsburgh style hot dog as I have an affinity for a good pierogi... and it did not disappoint!!

This is definitely a restaurant we will be back to on future visits to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"We had a great time at Franktuary!  I had read about this little joint in the Post Gazette and thought we would give it a shot.  We dined on a Saturday afternoon and were lucky enough to get one of the few parking spaces reserved for the restaurant behind the building.  We were seated in one of the tables and the waitress quickly came to bring water glasses as well as a large bottle of tap to refill our glasses - always a plus in our book.  We ordered hot dogs and poutine and were pleased with our orders.  I decided to try a Pittsburgh dog as well as a Bangkok dog while my husband ordered a Texan and a Southern Belle.  The dogs themselves were good with a good snap on the skins, the potato buns were soft and tasty, and the toppings were fresh, creative, and really tasty.  Unfortunately, the gravy wasn't yet ready for our poutine Quebecois so the waitress suggested we order the Buffalo poutine instead which was really delicious.  The Boylan soda on tap is another unexpected treat!  We really enjoyed our visit to Franktuary and are likely to visit again!"}
{"text":"Total meh.  The poutine was NOT poutine.  The gravy was all wrong and the curds weren't melted a bit. If you want better poutine, go to Park Brugges.  The chickpea fries were overly peppered and were just one note, though they were lighter than other versions I've had.  Hot dogs were ok. Had a dog with chili on it, there was a lack of depth of flavor in the chili, needed more cumin or something. A bit of sweetness is fine with chili, but it was missing the hot and the spice.  I like the hotdogs much better at Station Street.  The atmosphere was nice and the seating was cool (with the pews and all) but not really going to be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went back. Not only are the veggie dogs delish, but the veggie sausage is too!!! I actually went back the first time after work HH and was a little tipsy, so I had to go again the next day to be sure everything was as delish as I remembered!

I really liked the Chicago and Pittsburgh Dogs, the veg chili and cheese was good too!"}
{"text":"This is a great place even for a vegetarian foodie like me.  The place was not crowded, but they have trivia nights happening every Tuesday which gets a lot of people. Great place for sumptuous dinner, nice people too.."}
{"text":"Ugh.

Dear Franktuary,

Please stop attempting to make brunch.  Your selection is pathetically small and overpriced.  You pile on your subpar fries to make up for actual brunch foods.  You refuse to put cheese on scrambled eggs (cheddar is on the menu, so I know you have it!), with a pretentious, \"Noo, we don't do that.....\"  Whatever that means.  And your veggie sausage is REPUGNANT.  Sausage is not supposed to crumble apart, regardless of what it's made from.  Please stick to making hot dogs.

Bottom line: my husband and I left your restaurant feeling very hungry.  That sucks.  

Also, let's agree to start using Heinz ketchup.  Whatever recipe you have is NOT cutting it.  I advise anyone going here to bring their own bottle."}
{"text":"Great place! Had to make reservations for a large group and they were very accommodating. Best and easiest experience I had with team reservations! Great food too, covering a wide spectrum of tastes and dietary restrictions. Vegan? Check. Gluten free? Check.  Would absolutely make this a part of any trip to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"we had taken an Uber up to the area from downtown and came across this place. It looked interesting, so we checked it out. We went there really to just get a drink, but couldn't pass up ordering some dogs. We ordered five of them: New Yorker, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Chicago Impostor and Oahu. They were all very good. The Pittsburgh with pierogi, slaw and ranch was different but probably our favorite. Our waitress was awesome and made for a great experience."}
{"text":"Hot dog these hot dogs are delicious! No but seriously you have to try these hot dogs. I love hot dogs and I love gourmet and this is a beautiful marriage blessed by god of the two. I always try their dog of the month but also have several favsies in particular the mexican of yeah and the hotdogs and the spicy mustard!! and they have fun delicious specialty sodas!!! Did I mention I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I ordered a Chicago Impostor with a locavore frank. The Chicago aspect was lacking but this was kind of taken care of by their use of the word \"impostor\". There were no poppy seeds on the bun and it did not appear to be steamed. Also, rather than the traditional and tastier sport peppers, they used banana peppers.

The locavore frank, however, was to die for. Never before have I had such a hot dog. Plump and rather drably colored (due to the lack of artificial dyes), this hot dog comes straight from Volant, PA. I was kind of amazed that Franktuary would go through the trouble and at the significant price increase, was wondering if the different was worth it.

Boy was it. The frank was plump, juicy and tender on the inside with a much more delicate flavor profile. Rather than the taste of filler and water, I actually felt like I was eating a tubular steak. This, paired with the awesome components of a Chicago style hot dog (the best way to do a frank) made for one hell of a lunch.

I also ordered one of their smoothies, the aptly named \"purple\". It was a bit on the sweet side but nonetheless delicious.

I'll definitely come back to Franktuary even though the location necessitates that you have some other errand to run downtown. It's hard to park and when you find a spot, it gets costly. Franktuary's dedication to the hot dog is bar none in Pittsburgh, however, so it's worth it."}
{"text":"Food is 5 star, beer list is 4. The service is 1. You're treated like a second class citizen at this place. I would return because I like good beer and hotdogs and they nail those things, but their servers are short, abrasive and almost confrontational. The hostess made us wait for almost 10 minutes to sit down because she had to clear a table even though there were 7 tables open and the No Wait Ap said come on in!  Service needs big time improvement."}
{"text":"This place is quirky in its own right.  The dogs are great quality and they're made-to-order.  From Chicago to Boston to Dahntown styles they're definitely dogs for all kinds of folk and tastes.  For the nit-picky person the setting and facilities might raise a warning flag or three, but taste the food and your fears will abate.'

Pluses:  the hot dog themed gummies and Boyle's pop!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a great casual atmosphere with charm, excellent service, great prices and above all great food!

Tonight we had the pirogies, poutine, corn dog Texan style vegan-super delic!  There is a great selection of options for vegetarians/vegans."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Lawrenceville!  Great selection of beers and lots of options for hot dogs/sausages.  Even have multiple vegetarian/vegan options! 

My go to order is: a Chicago Veggie dog on multigrain and fries.  I normally get the poutine as well.  

The restaurant is normally crowded (probably because good food that is seriously inexpensive is hard to come by), but reservations are possible."}
{"text":"This was my third time at Franktuary. I love their hot dogs & sausages. I have been eating their food since they started downtown under a different name many years ago. Their food is always delicious. All the hot dogs & sausages I've had were very good.

This time we only got Québécois poutine, which was phenomenal and what you want in a good poutine. It had a lot of gravy & large creamy cheese curds. Yum!

My husband also got a seasonal rum drink at the bar that he loved. The bartender was very nice and accommodating. I like sweet drinks & she tried to help me find something I liked since they didn't have any sweet drinks.

We stayed for trivia, had a great time & won. We got a $25 gift card for winning. It was tons of fun & we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place - especially since it is available on Grubhub!  

Great options (including vegan options), so it is good for everyone.  I love the Chicago imposter - onions, mustard, pickle, tomato, & banana peppers. Big portions of French fries (definitely enough to share). 

Solid beer options when you are dining in. Really cute little spot just off of market square. 

They aren't open on Sunday."}
{"text":"I am always looking for a good hotdog place Because it's one of my fav foods. Many people have to told me to come here but I haven't had a chance.

Last night we decided to finally go and we left pretty happy. I ordered the Seattle with out onions and added bacon. I also had a side of bacon baked beans and it was very good. I got the standard dog.  After I finished I wanted a corn dog so I got one of those too. I was pretty full too. My boyfriend orders the Chicago imposter with pierogis and he really enjoyed it. He is not a hot dog guy so I was super excited and surprised that he liked it. 

The restaurant was empty and we had not issue getting a seat. Our server was very nice and came by every often , which we liked. The restaurant was very intimate and I liked that.

We will def be coming back again ! We got 2 hotdog, a corndog, and two sides for like 25 bucks, so we were happy."}
{"text":"I am generally not a fan of hot dogs - but Franktuary is the wonderful exception to this. I consider them a super tasty treat, especially since this location in particular is very popular.

I've been able to dine here a handful of times, sometimes with friends and sometimes just during a day with me, myself and I. The food has consistently been to die for. During one dinner with friends I tried the oahu frank, which was piled so high with topping goodness that it probably could have come with a warning and extra napkins. And the poutine! We all happily split a pile of fresh cut fries, complete with a layer of gravy underneath that mountain of potatoes, topped off with some cheese curds. Everyone was impressed, including a friend who admitted he usually isn't big on poutine.
During another visit I was super excited to sample their brunch menu for the first time. That time I got another super tasty frank complete with a Pimm's cocktail, because I believe in treating myself. Not only was the cocktail delightful, but since I came for brunch, my amazing bacon and cheddar topped frank also included a fried egg. Yum. All of the yum!

What holds me back from giving this place a 5 star rating is the repeat problems related to seating and service. It seems that whenever I step into this place the front host is busy helping with an issue at one of the tables. I'm not at all bashing the staff for doing their job and helping to address those problems, but I've admittedly come to expect that no one will able to greet me right away when I walk into this place. Additionally, the servers always seem super busy. They definitely do an amazing job juggling large numbers of people, so all of the kudos to them - but I wish more helping hands could be brought in to lighten their workload (and, yes, to improve the speed of the service). The slowdowns I've regularly experienced are clearly no one person's fault, and since the food is always top notch I more or less shrug and plan accordingly. Still, it's admittedly my dream to come in and enjoy a meal without watching and worrying about servers and bartenders literally jogging to and from the kitchen.

Definitely visit this place when you have the time to do so - the food is amazing and the atmosphere is very relaxing and chill, and I personally am always excited at the idea of returning to Franktuary!"}
{"text":"I am so happy to have a Franktuary downtown again! Having to drive to Lawrenceville for a good hot dog fix was a tasty but not ideal arrangement for me. Having the ability to just walk to Franktuary during my lunch break or after work - now THAT'S more like it!

While smaller than their Lawrenceville counterpart, this location makes the most of what they have. Orders can be taken to go, or you can enjoy them at a window seat, a long communal table, or (I'm assuming) the bar. Since I come here during work days I haven't taken advantage of said bar just yet, but one day...

In the meantime I've held myself over by ordering and enjoying the same delicious food I love at Franktuary's other location. The fresh and grass fed meat option continues to make me a hot dog convert - at least for these hot dogs - and the poutine remains one of the tastiest things I know of. Potatoes and cheese...two of my favorite things that just belong together, smothered in gravy...

Sorry, I think I need to step away and clean the drool off of my face now. You get the picture though, right? This place is cozy, the food is tasty, and I hope they stick around in Market Square for a long time to come!"}
{"text":"Definitely not your next brunch spot. 

I ordered the heavenly trinity with fries, eggs, and sausage links. The sausage was overcooked and had hardened.  I always enjoy sausage links, but these were by far the worst I have ever tasted. The eggs were cold and seemed to have been cooked in advance. The food was very disappointing.  

Service was good and staff was friendly; however, if you are debating whether or not to try out Franktuary for brunch I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Despite the odd store hours and location of this frank store, I like this place (esp with the Groupon discount). Not to mention, for every 10 franks that you purchase, you get 1 free!

Winners: Italy and Texan... yeehaw! :)"}
{"text":"Good dogs, good poutine, great atmosphere. I wasn't a huge fan of the pickle platter but the nice selection of craft beers made up for that."}
{"text":"Franktuary is good, slightly overpriced hot dogs.  The environment and the bar are really the stars.

I got the Bangkok Underdog.  It was a tasty dog with just a bit of spice.  The Thai peanut sauce really went well with the hot dog.  I could have eaten more than one of these for sure.  It was about $6.  

My husband got two hot dogs, the Texan and the Southern Belle and was pleased with both of them.  

The big problem we had was the poutine.  We love poutine.  We seek it out.  When we saw the Poutine Quebecoise on the menu, with cheese curds and brown gravy, we knew we had to order it.  

Problem is, it's a brown gravy made of mushrooms and I don't know this for sure (their menu is extremely uninformative), but I think the cheese curds were some vegetarian invention.  

I don't have a problem with vegan or vegetarian food.  Even though I am undeniably Team Meat, sometimes I even enjoy it.  I do not, however, like to be surprised by meatless dishes that traditionally are filled with meat and dairy deliciousness.  We asked the waiter, what is up with this gravy?  He said \"it's mushroom gravy, I know, it tastes a little weird.\"

The poutine was OK, but I don't like mushrooms to begin with, so there's no chance I\"m scarfing down a plate of mushroom gravy.  If there would have been any note on the menu of what was in this poutine, we would not have ordered it and instead tried a different version.  

Shame on you Franktuary!

Bottom line:  Go for happy hour, enjoy the stunning bar and the fantastic drink and beer selection.  Get a dog but don't expect to make it a meal unless you want to drop cash."}
{"text":"Seriously bummed I didn't like this place but the experience was miserable. Went during happy hour and the vibe I guess was chill enough but people were kind of crowding the entrance to the bar area when there were at least 6 booths with no one in them. So I kind of awkwardly stand around because I'm not sure if I go to the bar for food or if I sat down someone would serve me. I sat down and realized no one was serving me so I go to the bar and I ask about the specials. I get the special cocktail and it was good but not my style and I order food. Thirty minutes go by and no food, guy behind the bar says that I didn't order food and then he's all \"oh yea I'm so sorry...on the house\". By this point I was all nah I'm over it\". I did get another drink that was tasty but not worth it...Moscow mule with cranberries...but they forgot the cranberries. This was a bust."}
{"text":"What more can you say about exceptional poutine and dogs. ..Very good beer list too. Nice vegetarian options as well."}
{"text":"let me start by saying this is a terrible review and I don't like when people do this but....as a reminder to myself, I'm writing.  I stopped in here because I wanted to get some pierogies before I left Pburgh and I was running out of time. So...i didn't try any of the hot dogs.  and (I will admit) i LOVE hot dogs!  So i'll def be back.  :) however, i did get an order of 3 or so pierogies and though they were fried (i prefer mine either just boiled or pan fried), they were delicious!  

they have a nice bar with a good selection of booze and the place is bigger than i expected with an open feel, big windows and a cool vibe. i'll def head back and try a hot dog!!"}
{"text":"All dogs go to heaven, but first you have to repent at Franktuary.  

At first I was an unbeliever.  I mean, how good can you make a haute dog?  I was blind, but now I see.  Just have a little faith!  I tried the classic Texan (chili + cheese + jalapenos) and a gourmet Pittsburgh (coleslaw + smooshed pierogie aka pot-sticker wrapping).  I liked the type of hot-dog buns used.  It didn't collapse or split under pressure.  It must be a sin to make a hot-dog so divine.  I slurped down the heavenly blue (blueberry blackberry raspberry) fruit shake very quickly."}
{"text":"I will forever remember Franktuary as the place where I tasted my first proper pierogi, and for that reason alone it will hold a happy place in my heart. 

So, yeah I had pierogi, but the real reason we came here was for the drinks. And drinks we had! Awesome, refreshing and classic Mai Thias and Daiquiris, to be precise. I was really thrilled to see these two warm weather drinks on the menu and done in the simple, old fashioned way -- no blender or crushed ice here, my friends. 

The service was good at the bar, and I enjoyed being part of what seemed like a regular crowd -- friends gathered, fun conversations and a bartender who was interactive and quick. 

I'm not entirely sure what's keeping me from giving Franktuary a full five stars, as I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. Compared to other places in Pittsburgh, it wasn't as mind-blowing or as much of a revelation, but it's a great spot and I'd totally hit it up again. Especially for those pierogi, man!"}
{"text":"while traveling from chicago through Pittsburgh naturally i wanna see if this city can produce a good hot dog.  i walk into this place and they have a picture of the most famous sausage guy in all of chicago, Doug from Hot Doug's, in visible site.  so i'm a little more optimistic after seeing that because they obviously know what a good chef he is.  so i got the New Yorker and the Chicago impostor.  they were both solid dogs.  don't let them talk you into getting the Locavore meat because, regardless of price, it just wasn't as tastey as the 1/7 and the 1/6.  but i am not a fan of jumbo dogs any where in the world, so this wasn't a surprise to me.  solid dog joint, would take friends here if i happen to be in town again"}
{"text":"Took my mom and boyfriend here for Sunday brunch because I'd enjoyed it for beer and hotdogs with friends before. Never, ever going to Franktuary again after the experience we had with our waiter.

My mom's bacon came out barely cooked, so she sent it back to be cooked properly. Because there's an open kitchen, she then saw our waiter *pick the bacon up in his bare hands and put it back on her plate.* Seriously, what? No gloves, no handwashing. I don't know where this guy's hands have been - he could have touched any number of unwashed surfaces, foods, or body parts before that bacon. Grosser than gross.

I could have forgiven that (maybe, and with a write-off of the bacon) if the waiter hadn't been so nasty. Instead of apologizing, he got defensive: \"What, you think no one touches anything with their hands in the kitchen?!\" I'm not naive - sure people touch things when cooking. But at a restaurant, I expect people who handle food to wash their hands regularly, wear gloves, and use tongs whenever possible. Anyway, the waiter just got ruder and more obnoxious after that - to the point that he FOLLOWED US OUT TO THE STREET TO YELL AT US after we left him no tip (sorry, but he certainly did nothing to earn one).

Between the unsanitary food handling and the attitude, I won't be going back to Franktuary. I'm also filing a report with the County Health Department because I don't usually order e. coli with my meals."}
{"text":"This was the last place I tried on my trip to Pittsburg. It was bad but it wasn't exceptionally good either. It was about an average restaurant. Ive definitely been to better hot dawn centric places in the past. 

I always love a good hot dawg. The taste was ok but nothing really stuck out. I will say their pirogies were nice. It was my first time having them. And I was suggested to try them by someone in our party. Their menu wasn't bad and had a good amount of choices. I can say that nobody in our party was particularly impressed too much. 

The setting was just \"ok\" it was hard to find anything that just stuck out to me. This place is probably  best for just getting something to eat that isn't bad while your on the move or just with friends."}
{"text":"Oh, how I've yearned to come back to you my sweet sweet love Franktuary. I'll never forget the first time I met you in a food truck in front of PNC park. You had me at hello \"what kind of dog would you like.\" Your sweet smell of all beef dog sizzling on the grill intoxicated me. The first bite of crunchy outside natural casing and delicious  all beef juicy heaven on the inside was to die for. I'm a hot dog \"lover\" of sorts and can't get enough of this place when I'm in the burgh.  I talk about gourmet hot dogs with a passion to anyone who will listen to me talking about gourmet hot dogs. Sounds a little ridiculous but theses dogs are worth talking about. The dogs are perfectly cooked juicy inside with a crunch on the outside. Precisely toasted buns and toppings for the dogs accentuate the gourmet feel of the dogs.  Can't recommend this hot dog shop enough for anyone who loves hot dogs."}
{"text":"So I have been on maternity leave and I can't get enough of this place. It's my favorite lunch spot in downtown. Who doesn't love a good beef hot dog! 

I always order the standard frank. There are so many other great options, but I haven't gone wrong with this one. I love the standard frank with the grass fed chilli, cheese and onions. The chilli is really really good. I totally want to eat it by itself one day. 

Don't. Forget. To Buy. The Fries. Thank me later. These things are sooo fresh and they give you so much of them for very little. I love dipping my fries in the aioli sauce. It's like a really good mayo. You got to dip.

Service is always quick when I go. And they have a diverse staff which I can appreciate. It's one of the hippest places in market square. Sometimes, I meet people here for work meetings during lunch. It's something about eating a hot dog that breaks the ice and lets others' guards down!"}
{"text":"I have heard about Franktuary and had been planning on checking it out.   After stopping at three other places, all of which we're closed , I ended up here.  

The atmosphere.   Clean and open but loud.  Made it hard to talk with Dana across the table.   The garage door walls were open and the breeze was nice. 

The prices are a little ridiculous for the basic dog.  $3.5-4?  Come on.  Lower the cost of the dogs and increase the topping style costs.   So the dogs came.    There is nothing.  Repeat nothing! Special about a basic beef wiener on a potato bun.  The toppings were fresh and well prepared.   But it doesn't make us ever want to come back.     Ever!

Don't get me wrong , the dogs, when topped, are good.  I just don't think they will be able to sustain a regular, dependable crowd at these prices.    We left hungry and feeling tricked out of $20+"}
{"text":"I love that they have vegetarian hot dogs AND corn dogs. Good happy hour specials too.
Mary P is the best server we've ever had. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I went here for lunch with three other people. I was promptly sat by a polite waiter who brought water in glass bottles. He also gave my friends son crayons and paper to color which was nice. The garage style doors were open, but not quite warm enough for this yet. Kept my coat on and was still cold the whole time! Service was SO SLOW! 40 minutes for hotdogs and french fries?? Come on. Not to mention it was a weekday lunch, and I had to get back to work. Which I was late for by the way! Also, the music was odd and too loud!

The food was so, so. I liked that the fries are fresh cut, but they were overcooked and over salted. The hotdogs were skinny! Not what I expected for $4 each! Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner and a drink yesterday to support the \"9-Mile Run Watershed Association.\" Ordered a mulke-type cocktail for $6, a good value there. For food, I had the Quebecois poutine and a \"New York\" style kielbasa.  The place was busy, but I found the last seat at the bar.  Food came quickly once I ordered. I was surprised.   
  The food tasted fine, but all the ingredients came with multiple adjectives (grass-fed, local-sourced, organi, etc.) that probably force the prices up and the portions down.  So, it's a place I would go occasionally, but too pricey to make it a regular stop.  
  There were plenty of kids there, although the for some kids the noise level would be too high."}
{"text":"very unusual concept, but seems to be working in the Lawrenceville section of Pitt. The dogs were good, not great. I guess i'm just not that big of a hot dog foodie. I had the thai hot dog. we had fries that we had to send back and they did make them right very quickly I may add. It was pretty crowded and the table next to use was extremely load and the staff did nothing about at all. Not my job to police the floor, but it was loud enough that I was pretty close. Staff was OK, Rod so he said was not a server but a host, his admission, did OK. I guess i'm just a dirty O kinda guy, or Frankie's right down the street,"}
{"text":"Can you say Olympic donuts and coffee!?

Decided to give Frantuary's brunch a try on an Olympic Hockey Sunday and was thrilled to find out they opened early (730am) with free donuts and coffee for the hockey game.

After noshing on some quite delectable cinnamon rolls and joe, we asked for some brunch menus at 10am and dived in.  Build-your-own poutine for the wife, breakfast sandwich for the brother and breakfast flat bread for me.  While my flat bread was decent, the poutine and breakfast sandwich were better.  I recommend her combination of sweet potatoes, sausage and red-eye gravy for a unique combo!  I know this is a frank spot, but I actually prefer their non-frank options!

I cannot count the amount of times one of the owners came up and asked how we were doing, which is another plus...  extremely friendly and down to earth people.  For the oddest reason I found myself completely relaxed and in the moment here, which is rare nowadays.  Definitely a plus in my book!"}
{"text":"It's not your typical hot dog place. They have several options to load up your dog, and have a hot dog, side of fries and soft drink lunch special. It's a pretty good deal and you're full afterwards. 

I like the Oahu dog, it has BBQ sauce, pineapple and bacon. It's unique and not something you'd make at home!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night, didn't need to wait more than fifteen minutes for a table, the hot dogs were really cheap, but the drinks not so much.

We got a larryville mule to drink, which was delicious, and a Pittsburgh and PA Dutch dog to eat, which were inexpensive and awesome.

Fairly large establishment for the area while maintaining a cozy feel."}
{"text":"I was overnighting in Pitt and looking for a quick bite on the way out, and a hot dog shop in a church totally seemed like a great idea. 

Being from Chicago, I dig hot dogs. We are a city built on hot dogs. We have our own style. So I don't see Franktuary as a \"hipster trend\", as some have said. On the contrary, I find them to be innovative in their approach to toppings and ethical in their approach to community.

I had the Pittsburgh Dog, which included a pierogi and cole slaw. This was a badass combo of flavor and texture which blended to make life seem worth living again. The crunch of the slaw (which was loaded with red cabbage and a creamy dressing without the sour), the softness of the pierogi (which softly whispered \"make love to me\" as I bit into it), colliding with the pop as you bit into the sausage itself did well.

Here in Chicago, we have some chain spots that are banging ingredients together to be  .... uh ... I don't know, funny? This reckless juxtaposition of ingredients without consideration of how well they will play together is just stupid. Franktuary, to me, didn't do that. Everything seemed crafted and thought out.

Prices are actually not that bad. Yes, you pay more for local, organic meat. But I ain't mad. I'll pay more for a hot dog that had a name and good home. If we all start actually ponying up and buying local, prices will go down. I know, I know. 

The sodas appeared to be local as well, or at least I hadn't heard of them. And i got a gummy hot dog.

I was surprised that there were no fries, and on asking, it was clear that they didn't have a fryer ... being in a church basement. But this almost impressed me. It's clear that they were working with what they had. I'm sure they could have paid for a storefront with a fryer and all that, but by being in the church, they were finding another way to support the community they were in. I dig that. I ain't gonna fault it.

So, yeah. Why not? Don't be grumpy about it, oh ye Yelpers. This place is local, unique, tasty, and trying to be ethical at the same time. That's five stars in my playbook."}
{"text":"Oh my lanta! This place has amazing cocktails! I think we sampled nearly every drink in the menu... Yes, I do remember them. Our favorite was their take on a classic old fashioned. Simple, delicious and light. The blood orange tequila cocktail was also so good! Not too sweet, which I appreciated. 

The food, however, was just ok! I felt like they skimped on the quality of some of the main ingredients (a hot dog bun, my friends, can truly be a make or break). The poutine was a fun concept but our fries weren't hot! So sad, isn't it? I will give it to them though, their pirogies were out of this world tasty. They're deep friend... How bad can that be?) 

Our server was the nicest hipster I've ever met and the bartender was awesome so no complaints there.  

Overall would be very happy to return... As long as I have an uber to drive me home..."}
{"text":"Food is decent. It's not some place I would like to come back and eat all the time. It's slightly pricey for what they serve and I am not a huge fan of hotdogs"}
{"text":"The food at Franktuary is good.  They offer creative options for a hotdog, but don't go here expecting good service. We went here on a Wednesday and half the tables were empty. After placing our order, we waited 35 minutes to get two hotdogs.  During that time the waiter never bothered to stop to refill drinks or let us know the status of our order.  I don't believe I will be heading back to Franktuary anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is more or less a 3.5 star kinda place now don't get me wrong it's a nice place good hot dogs but for a hot dog place there not as amazing as talked about. I normally get the organic grass fed dog and the Pittsburgh style and it's really good. The spicy chili they have is the best. Prices are okay and nice place to stop on a date but certainly not fancy enough for a serious date menu is small and only serves 3 different things: chili, hot dogs, and salads with a few sides like chips, fries, and drinks"}
{"text":"The miso kale salad is one of my favorite salads! The different varieties of hot dogs are fun, but I'm not a huge fan of the poutine because the French fries lack texture for me."}
{"text":"Ofcourse being plantbased, this place is a must, and very appealing in the hipster section of Lawrenceville in Pittsburgh. We got hot dogs, the place itself is wonderful, service very friendly; we were asked to join in Bingo and won gift cards we later redeemed with our bill- which leads me to 4 stars and not 5: this swanky place is expensive! I think about 8 bucks a dog  however as far as vegan options, service, & atmosphere, this place is well worth trying."}
{"text":"I had a seminar downtown and was curious what all the hype was about. I figured gourmet hot dogs would do the trick for munching on outside and people watching with the hip downtown lunch hour crowd.

This place is in a church basement, which could get slightly confusing if you do not peer through the doorway.

Their menu is succinct, offering all natural beef dogs with a variety of toppings. I went with the texas style chili dog, as I love chilli and jalapenos. I ordered a side salad as well.

The bun seemed like a regular dollar store hot dog bun. If you are going to serve me a \"gourmet\" hot dog, please use a gourmet bun. The dog was decent, but nothing I wouldnt be able to procure in a store and make myself. The Chilli topping was run of the mill regular chilli. Once again, I can make this at home.

The salad was almost entirely spinach greens and perhaps 3 vegetables.

My advice, lose the small weiner syndrome and give me something worth buying.

I guess I will stick to Samuel L Jacksons advice and merely go for \"tasty burgers\" instead."}
{"text":"Overall disappointed... pass on this place for brunch...though the concept was strong that's really the only thing that was. The frank was oily in a tough casing and was generally not appetizing. The unique delivery of the brunch frank topped with fried egg, cheese and bacon had real potential and frankly (pun not intended) were not a bad flavor combination if everything was not just average. The bun tasted store bought, which I'm sure most buns are but I was hoping for it  to be less obvious in the taste. I chose the salad over fries and was surprised to be served a large bed of leafy kale (which I guess could be nice if you like that sort of thing). A couple of my friends had the standard mimosa and were sorely disappointed. It was made with fresh squeezed orange juice which they said tasted \"off\". I will say that the service was strong and friendly but I'd be doing you a disservice to say that compensated for the flaws. I will however add that the variety of hotdogs and poutins was like something I had never seen and you get a decent amount of food for a decent price sooo if you're not as concerned about overall taste and just want somewhere \"cool\" for a frank and a beer well... maybe it's for you"}
{"text":"Cozy establishment that still has some relics left behind from the church that once occupied this spot. We sat in a pew, which is about exactly as comfortable as it sounds. There was plenty of regular tables and bar seating for those not inclined to experience that weird bit of history.

Franktuary had an impressive beer selection that did not disappoint. Probably the best tasting 11% beer I've ever had was from Farmville, NC right next door to my old alma mater. They also had an extensive bottle selection and full bar. 

The review is for the following hot dogs which I recommend you try: Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Bangkok. The Pittsburgh was garnished with two deep fried pierogis, the Chicago was missing the poppy seed bun and had a very strange pickle (not Vlasic) but was still good, and the Bangkok was different, but enjoyable. My biggest gripe with each is that the bun was not buttered and toasted and it was almost as if they had taken a bun right out of the bag and put it on the plate. A butter toasted bun can turn a mediocre hamburger or hot dog into a great and memorable one. 

We also shared a plate of regular Quebec poutine between four people which was certainly enough to fill you up. The fries and gravy were quite good but the curds could have been melted or at least hot as they were not.

Four stars for the beer selection, three for the hot dogs and poutine. I think there is room for improvement with their food, but it was still tasty nonetheless. 3.5/5

Parking fills up fast so get there early, or walk."}
{"text":"If I had a dollar for every time I visited Hot Dogma back in the day, I'd have...well, about $6.  Still, I adored it.  When the Dogma hit the fan and the name changed, I happily kneeled to Franktuary instead.  So, when word came that the one and only sanctuary of franks was opening in my 'hood, I was excited!  Unfortunately, I've been here thrice so far and have yet to love it.  The menu looks good in theory, but the food and service are average in my opinion.  

Sure, $4ish for a dog is a bit on the high end, but if the ingredients make up for it, I'm fine with the price tag.  However, what I do think is a bit much is the fragment of romaine lettuce I received with my salmon fishfurter recently.  It wasn't even enough lettuce to roll up alongside the dog (if you're a weirdo who likes to wrap everything in lettuce like I do).  At 50 cents extra, it's not going to break the bank, I'm curious as to why I'm paying 50 more cents to forego the nice looking fresh bun for half a leaf of romaine - I just don't get it. My manfriend went for one of the poutines and was also pretty disappointed.  I say, stick to Kelly's for poutine, check out Franktuary downtown for a dog and stop by the L'Ville location for their bar.  Everybody wins."}
{"text":"Meh. Sure, the hot dogs are good, and you can get it piled with toppings. But it's quite expensive for what you get!

And I was really excited to see they had Poutine on the menu, as my Canadian brethren had told me legends about the stuff. But I came away a little disappointed. Guess I'll have to wait until I end up in Quebec to try it again!"}
{"text":"The concept of this place is brilliant to me, since I'm a hillbilly that moved into the city. Let's take hot dogs, which are normally poor people chow, and make them fancy!

As far as the execution, I think it is done pretty well. They have a lot of good options. The food is generally good.

The alcohol is a bit expensive, and in general expect to pay a lot here and not get a filling meal. I wish they made it a little more \"gourmet\" for the price they charge. I also wish they had a little bit more finely tuned recipes for the hot dogs -- you can create a custom one, but I usually trust the restaurant to have the best ideas for specialty dogs, which they don't really.

The decor is nice, and kind of funny, but they should definitely be a little more forward with the theme. It's church-themed, get it? It's hard to remember that when you're in the restaurant. I guess maybe they don't want to offend people but I just wish they were a little more forward with it, to be honest. Could be funny."}
{"text":"It was an on the spot decision to try out this place. We had heard good words and it seemed promising so we thought to give it a try. The ambiance was great; a nice, cozy joint to enjoy your food and drinks. Service was fast and polite and the food was good as well. We got a meatball sandwich and a frank with an order of fries (btw garlic aioli is a must!). Everything was great! However I am giving this place a three because it is highly overpriced for what it offers. It is a hot dog joint and for the order above (plus 2 sodas) we paid 22$ ! I will definitely try it again if I am around but I am not sure I will decide to drive 20 mins just for to have a lunch/dinner at this place. 

Ah also we went on a really cold night and it felt like there was barely any heating :)"}
{"text":"Having been to the original Franktuary location in the basement of a church downtown, and also having eaten from the roving food truck, I wasn't sure what to expect from this new location. In short, it's awesome. A surprisingly large and tastefully decorated space with high ceilings, church pew seating, and a full bar!

This place is all about local. They have local breweries such as East End Brewing Company on tap, as well as cider from Arsenal Cider House. Soon, they will be featuring drinks made with whiskey from the local Wigle Whiskey.

Food-wise, In addition to somewhat standard hot dogs, they have some amazingly creative options such as the fishfurter. Yes, you read that right, a frank made from fish. Toppings for your hotdog range from traditional to Mexican to Japanese complete with wasabi mayo. Not feeling like hotdog? How about a salad with (optionally) a hotdog chopped up on top of it? If you're vegetarian, they even have a tofu hotdog. French fries are referred to as \"boring fries\" since the non-boring fries are made out of garbanzo beans (surprisingly good). You certainly won't be bored with the menu."}
{"text":"Lol. Franks be to God. Amen! 

I can dig it."}
{"text":"Franktuary - I have always wanted to like you. Truly. But...the feelings just aren't quite there. 

My husband and I have lived in Lawrenceville for nearly 4 years. When Franktuary opened, we were excited to try it. We heard such rave reviews! However we were very underwhelmed with our first experience. Mediocre service and food, overpriced for what you got. It wasn't until this past year, when their food truck would be parked outside of Brew Gentleman and we would have an occasional Texan that we warmed up to the idea of trying them out again for dinner. 

Last night we were to meet friends at Grapperia and we wanted to grab a quick bite close by. There was a wait at Round Corner Cantina, so we figured we'd give Franktuary another shot. Again, it was a disappointment. We were promptly greeted and seated by a friendly hostess who told us our server would be right with us. There were a fair amount of people there, but by no means was it busy. And we waited. And waited. After 15 minutes or so, my husband and I started having the discussion of how much longer we were willing to wait, when our server came to our table and apologized, saying there was a miscommunication. No issues with service from that point on, but our confidence was definitely wavering, as I had mentioned earlier that our service during our last visit wasn't the best. 

I ordered the falafel, my husband ordered the Texan and a Pittsburgh and we shared an order of the Québécois poutine. It was fine. Absolutely nothing remarkable. My husband makes better hot dogs and falafel. The poutine is pretty delicious, but after a few bites the saltiness of the gravy is a bit intense for my taste buds, requiring me to chug our carafe of water. 

The bill plus tip came to $35. Which is not expensive, but for unsatisfying hot dogs and fries with gravy and a few cheese curds, it's also a disappointment. 

Bottom line, my gut was right from the beginning."}
{"text":"Franktuary is a little tough to review.  It is all about the hot dogs, and trust me, I do love a good hot dog.  Something about it makes me think of summer and baseball.  But hot dogs are a blank slates and that is basically what you start with here, then build it up.  I guess my biggest issue is the price.  And I don't seem to be alone here:) these are REGULAR size dogz, not 1/4 LB dogs.  I got two the Chicago Dog, and something called the Italian Dog that I haven't seen on the menu now, but it had basil olive oil mozzarella, and tomatoes on it.  I may be leaving out an ingredient there, so I apologize.  Now as for the  service and what not, I can't rate it, as I had my husband pick these up for me on his lunch break and bring them to me.  I was in the mood for a good dog and heard this was a great stop.  The two again \"regular sized dogs\" were about $10.00.  Not trying to sound cheap here but REALLY??? you can go to Sheetz and get two dogs for like a buck and they are the same size....  Anyhow they were good, but just that.  Certainly not $10.00 good for a hot dog and certainly not filling for a lunch.  I think this place is worth a try just to say you did it, but I wouldn't make it a regular stop.  Maybe I will try it again in the future and maybe not."}
{"text":"I usually avoid hot dog places, but I'd heard so many people rave about this place that I finally had to try it. Location is in the basement of a church downtown - hence the name. The grass fed beef \"locavore\" dog was hands down the best tasting dog I've ever had the pleasure of devouring! Lots of interesting toping choices such as the \"Italian\" with olive oil, tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese! I had a smoothie which was excellent, and they also offer salads. Worth trying!"}
{"text":"Franktuary has consistently provided great service and hot, delicious food every time I've been there. The first time it was on my birthday, and the boyfriend and I got a few hot dogs and some standard fries to share. The food was delicious and the portions were exactly right...not exactly a massive basket of fries, but if that's your thing go to a greasy dive bar. Our original waiter took a few minutes getting back to our table to take our order, and come to find out she'd forgotten about us. She apologized profusely and immediately produced a gift certificate for more than the price of our meal! We ordered a few extra cocktails and left with a wonderful impression of the place. 

The next time we came was for their late-night happy hour food specials on a Saturday. The half off deal on corn dogs was no longer current, but because we'd come and ordered them for that very reason our waitress gave us that price anyways. Their corn dogs are perfect by the way...hot and very crispy on the outside with the perfect amount of breading. When I crave Franktuary, it's always their corn dogs I think about!

The last time I was there was for a family birthday party. The staff expertly handled our party of fifteen by pushing three tables together and providing us with quick, excellent service throughout our visit. Nobody got the wrong food, and everyone seemed very happy with their choices. We ordered various hot dogs and multiple plates of poutine. There was about a thirty-minute wait before the meal due to it being dinner time, so several of us sat at the bar and took advantage of their delicious cocktails. The bartender was friendly and even made some custom drinks upon request. Overall my experiences here have been outstanding due to the professional friendly staff and quality food offerings. If you're going to eat a hot dog, Franktuary is the place to do it!"}
{"text":"If I didn't have a Groupon to try this place, I probably only would have tried one hot dog.  And I'm not sure that I would have chosen wisely.  I definitely felt some pressure from the hipsters behind the counter.  I carefully picked 4 different hot dogs to see what I might like.  The results:

The New Yorker was nothing special.  I don't know why, but I keep foolishly hoping to find a New York style hot dog in Pittsburgh that reminds me of the taste I had when I first tried Gray's Papaya.  Meanwhile, for the cost of this one hot dog I could have purchased the recession special at Gray's Papaya (2 hot dogs and a drink).  

The Locavore was definitely my favorite.  I tried this one just naked so I could taste the dog and not the toppings disguising what I wanted to be a great tasting dog.  And it was, but for over $5, that seems a bit much.

The Texan was a close second.  But with chili, cheese and jalepenos, how can you really mess this up?

The Italy was meh.  I was expecting more flavor.  I was disappointed.

When I combine all the ingredients (service, quality, price) I have to say that I'm not sure I would go back here.  Or recommend it.  I think there are better hot dog joints around Pittsburgh and I can't see spending $5 on one hot dog.  I won't even do that at a Pirates game."}
{"text":"This restaurant has missed the mark for me. The hot dogs are not so great that they should charge any more than a dollar.  Even the street vendors serve better hotdogs."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this is for only vegan food.

Pretty average dogs, but the poutine was incredible. The vegan dogs/toppings for them aren't overwhelming but the price point isn't too bad. 

We also had the VLT which had seitan bacon and it was our favorite sandwich. Probably would have been 3 stars if not for this sandiwch. 

Pro tip: don't get a small portion of poutine. Get the large, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Marvelous food in a rather unusual setting. I love the beer selections (East End Big Hops on tap, for example). The food is locally sourced from an impressive list of local and organic farms. Surprisingly diverse menu, with vegetarian options. 

Franktuary original location was Downtown at Trinity Cathedral. They have kept that history as an imaginative theme. It all makes sense, given the role monasteries played in developing great beer. It turns out that a church themed bar can be a marvelous way to spend an evening."}
{"text":"We have been here before a few times, and always enjoyed both the atmosphere and the food. Even my super picky mom loves the hot dogs. Recently, we have started attending trivia nights on Tuesday, and it is so much fun!!! We get a reservation and are seated promptly by the smiling hostess. The waitresses are great, very friendly and fun, joking with us and completing their tasks quickly and efficiently. 

They have an interesting list of cocktails as well as a varied beer list. Last week I started out with the Chabang Chabang, a gin drink with lemon and soda that was particularly refreshing on a hot summer day. Because of my food allergies I tend to shy away from the hot dogs (I am not a big fan of veggie dogs, and usually gluten free buns, which they do offer, have eggs in them). I do, however absolutely LOVE the garbanzo bean fries! Basically, they are just garbanzo beans ground up, baked, and then fried to perfection. They are crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. I follow it up with the vegan chili, which is surprisingly spicy and full of beans, peppers, and tofu. My husband does enjoy a good hot dog, and loves the Pittsburgh, which is covered in pierogies. We once split the kale salad, and it was also delicious, with roasted veggies and a light vinaigrette. When we are deep into trivia and need more sustenance we order a basket of homemade chips, which are thinner than I prefer but still a tasty snack to keep us going. 

I usually end the night with a cider that they have on draft from Arsenal cider. I've also had the Church Punch, which is a fun twist on the punch I grew up drinking at various church events. 

 Trivia is fast-paced and competitive, but always a great time. The host is inventive and smart, a great combo for the crowd in Franktuary. We hope to continue coming back for a long time."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner after completing the Lawrenceville Artists' Studio Tour, before a gig at the Thunderbird Cafe up the street.  Definitely a popular spot.  Great radio music.  Had an Arsenal cider, the Korean poutine, and the Reykjavik dog.  On a gluten-free bun!  It was all good.  I had never had poutine before, and I will definitely have to investigate more."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the new Market Square location, and I recently tried the Lville spot as well.  They were having a Grand Opening week only deal ~ any style dog for $2 (a throwback to the original prices when this hot dog shop first opened as Hot Dogma in 2004) between 2-4pm.  Can't beat that for a fancy hot dog.  We still had to pay the extra buck fifty for the gluten-free bun of course, but $3.50 is still way better than the $7 it would have been normal-price.

*Btw, gluten-free folks be wary; based on my experience after both visits, this place doesn't have the best separation of church and state.*  

You walk in the door and up to the counter straight ahead, place your order and pay, and they bring everything to you at your table as it's ready.  There's bar seating and bar-style window seating, with a few tables in the middle.  We took two spots at the window-bar and doubled as free advertisement to all the food-gawkers walking past.  The food came out quick ~ Texan grass-fed dogs followed by baked potato poutine.  The grass-fed dog was the exact same skinny, tough-skinned frank as the standard I'd gotten at the other location, only a couple of inches longer.  Add a mountain of shredded cheddar, a teeny bit of chili , and a couple jalapeño slices and you've got your basic Texan frank.  Maybe with a different/less cheese & more chili these would be more interesting.  I prefer the flavors of the Reykjavik from my previous visit.  The baked potato poutine was similar with another mountain of the same cheese, jalapeños, and sour cream.  Again, not my favorite flavor here.  

If you're going to spend your dough on Franktuary hot dogs, I'd say choose your flavors wisely, and make the trip to Lawrenceville for the extra atmosphere.  Or better yet, make your own.  Unless you can get them for 2 bucks."}
{"text":"My new favorite hot dog spot in town, with many options (including vegan and gluten-free!) and a killer cocktail bar that elevates it above your D's Six Pax of yore. They don't just do hot dogs -- they have great pierogies and a scrumptious thing called \"beetballs,\" which are the best vegetarian version of a meat product that I've ever eaten.

EDIT: I've been to Franktuary 4 times now -- the first three times, with 5-star service, and now a fourth with...let's round it up to 2-star. So I've averaged out my star-count to reflect that, and I'm here revising my comment about the universally great service. 

*Most* times, including on busy Saturday nights, service at the bar is terrific. But you might experience the odd Thursday night where the bartender, working alone, tends to ignore you, you'll watch some random guy spend half a freaking hour fiddling with the AV equipment instead of helping customers, and you'll wait almost 20 minutes just to pay the bill, at which point you'll angrily math out your own bill, leave cash/tip under your drink, and hope none of the \"Are you leaving yet?\" hipsters take it before the tender deigns to notice.

But at least 75% of the time, it will be a splendid experience."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure why I try things that I should know better than trying.  M and I came in at about noon on a Tuesday.  There were about 2-3 other tables and the very super friendly and nice girl behind the counter listed off the specials for the day since she was in the state of writing them as we walked in:

Dog with blue cheese, sauteed mushrooms and bacon
Beer cheese soup with cornbread croutons
Peppermint hot chocolate with chocolate covered candy cane. 

Yes, please!  However, as I am always watching calories and some days more than others and I thought with the hot chocolate, I should do something more, I ordered the veggie dog.  To say it was a bad idea would be a grave understatement. 

Now, I fully admit that this might have been my complete fault.  I bet that their 5 dollar locavore dog would have been amazing, but to say that the vegan tofu dog was disgusting would be an understatement.  I really felt like a little kid and wanted to spit it out.  What bothered me the most was the texture - mushy, pink goo.  Thank you, no.  

I opted to take the dog out of the bun and eat the bun, delicious blue cheese, well-done mushrooms and bacon.  All in all, not bad for a bun sandwich.  

I should have known better than to order the soup.  They always appear at the South Side Soup Crawl and every year I vote them most disgusting of soups.  While the flavor of the beer cheese wasn't bad - very beer-y - the texture was again all wrong.  Kind of like broth with floating cheese pieces.  The croutons however were delicious. 

The hot chocolate was fine, but also had weird floaters in it.

I did enjoy the gummy dog that you get with their meal. 

I would like to say that I would be back, but I think that soy dog is going to stick with me for a very long time. 

I totally support what they are trying to do in this interesting space, but sadly, it's just not for me."}
{"text":"I am a big hot dog fan and this is definitely the best hot dog place I've been to in years! The style of their menu is sort of like \"build your own\" hot dog, but they also have a set menu. I really enjoyed my Chicago style impostor hot dog and all of the different styles of fries they offer. They also have  a really good beer selection. They staff is also very nice and fun. My friend once asked for ketchup with her hot dog, and the waitress and I laughed and joked about her lack of hot dog cultural awareness.

I give this a four because I can't quite remember the pricing, but I'm sure it wasn't a steal. Anyway, it's a great menu that hits the spot every time and quality food and drinks!

There is street parking which can be quite the hassle on some nights but you can usually find something within that block pretty easily."}
{"text":"Very happy to see the folks from Franktuary expand.  The new location is a sit down restaurant with a bar.   Fancy cocktails, draft beer and Pittsburgh first draft kombucha.  I stopped by for the soft opening last week and I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is about the people - this place is run by great people who serve great food.  Lots of options on their fun menu.  They even serve soda from a local bottling company.  Free wireless. Fun times."}
{"text":"Came here for a drink while waiting for a table at the restaurant across the street... and, honestly, am thinking of staying. Friendly, laid-back atmosphere. The Memphis dog we shared to tide us over was delish! Just wish we'd noticed the Church Wine Punch on the bar menu before ordering, it looks so good!"}
{"text":"Ok. So I heard so much buzz about this place that I had to try it. It's a very cute restaurant with your typical trendy hipsters with beards lol.  Everyone is very nice. But honestly? There is nothing special about the hotdogs. Mine was not even hot, on a regular old bun. At least have big juicy hotdogs with unbelievable buns or something that makes them worth $4.00 other than being organic.  The fries were very ordinary and the poutine extremely mediocre. I don't know, maybe I set my expectations too high for a hotdog joint. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and left such a happy camper. The poutine Quebecoise was amazing (the gravy is mushroom based and a little salty, which I loved, but just FYI). I got the Chicago Imposter Grass Fed Beef Frank and it was so yummy. Topped it off with the East End Big Hops IPA and it made for a great meal. My friend and I split the poutine and each got one hot dog and we left feeling comfortably full but not stuffed. Without an appetizer, definitely get 2+ hot dogs (so much variety that that shouldn't be any trouble!). Definitely a great place to go with a group if you're feeling like some yummy bar food. Not too crowded, super fast service, great location!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. My recommendation? Try a variety, and definitely make it your business to try at least one 'local' dog covered with the  accoutrements that strike your fancy. Get a cocktail, and don't feel weird about ordering that third hot dog."}
{"text":"I visited Franktuary on Fri. evening at 6:30 with two friends of mine for dinner.  I'd been once before for brunch a couple of years ago, but had been wanting to return to try the gourmet hot dogs, which is what they are known for, but are not served at brunch.  My friends wanted to visit a restaurant in Lawrenceville, since they rarely visit that neighborhood.  I suggested either Franktuary or Round Corner Cantina, since I had City Dining Cards for both places, and they chose here.

For our entrees, we each ordered two hot dogs.  Because I don't eat beef, I chose to get a veggie frank banh mi style ($5.75) and a veggie corndog ($4), which I was excited to see on the menu, since I'd never been able to try a corn dog before.  Of these dogs, my favorite was the former; the veggie frank was rather bland, but the banh mi topping was on point, and added a lot of flavor to it, helping to disguise the blandness.  I was not a huge fan of the corn dog, since it had nothing to disguise the blandness other than the dipping sauce that came with it--Miller's mustard in my case.  Speaking of which, the mustard was quite different than what I was expecting; I'd describe it as a sweet chili mustard, and it was rather runny--I'm a mustard connoisseur, and I'm sorry to say that I wasn't a huge fan.  Both of my friends ordered standard franks, with one ordering them in the Pittsburgh and New York styles ($5 and $4.50, respectively), and the other ordering them in Koreatown and Chicago impostor styles (both $5).  Although I didn't try their dogs, the one preferred the Pittsburgh style, but found it a bit unwieldy to eat.  The other liked both of the styles he ordered, but found the parts containing more frank bland.

In addition to our entrees, we split an order of poutine Quebecoise ($8).  I must concur with several other reviewers that the predominant flavor of the gravy was salt.  The fries were of the hand cut variety but were underseasoned; thus, the best part was the cheese curds.  I've had poutine in PGH and elsewhere, and I've definitely had better versions.  Although this was my friends' first experience with poutine, they seemed to concur, based on how little they ate.  If I were to order poutine here again, I think I'd try another version, such as the baked potato one.  We also ordered dessert, with all of us getting the parfait with chocolate mousse, brownie, and cream cheese icing ($4).  Although I wasn't originally planning to get dessert here, I'm actually glad I did, since it was the best part of the meal.  It had a moist but firm consistency, including small chunks of chocolate, and the cream cheese icing worked well with it.

Overall, I wasn't super-impressed with my latest meal here, esp. given its cost (a bit less than $40 for three people after a $10 discount).  Believe it or not, I actually enjoyed my brunch here more--at the time, they had beignets that were really good.  The church-themed atmosphere is nice, and I have no major complaints about the service, but the food is inconsistent.  If I'm in the mood for gourmet hot dogs, I think I'll head over to D's in Regent Square instead.  Having said that, I would consider returning to Franktuary for drinks, since they have a nice looking bar and interesting cocktails--I'd love to try that church wine punch!  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"They have descent hot dogs and pokey stops nearby!

In the summer the front of the building is open, it's made of garage doors.

It's fun to eat and people watch from here!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to update that Franktuary also has a delicious brunch menu. I was actually disappointed when I showed up on a weekend afternoon lookin' for a quick dog, and realized it was brunch time. Well, that quickly melted away after I started munching on some sweet combo of eggs and local jalapeño/blueberry sausage. The Bloody Mary's had a bit too much of a kick, but otherwise it was a great meal. I'd definitely brunch here again in the future!"}
{"text":"O Franktuary, why have I waited this long to see you?  I've been working downtown for years and passed this by on enough occasions.  Yesterday an initial craving for Jimmy John's took a turn, and next thing I know I'm in line contemplating between going with a basic dog or upgrading to grass fed.  In the end, I went with a basic Reyjavik--i'm visiting there later this year and hear the hot dogs are one of the best cheap foods you can eat there, so I might as well start getting used to them.

But I digress--you can get anything from a plain dog to traditional condiments (think onions and ketchup) to fancy toppings like kimchee or pierogies, or just a nice juicy chili dog.  They have plenty of non-meat options too, if that's your preference.  There are also a few salad options, and fries.  Oh, fries.  These are those good and hearty ones with the potato skin still on them.  (Get the garlic aioli!)  It's a smallish place, but they've also got a full bar and a tv, so it would be a nice and fairly intimate place to go after work to grab a drink and watch a game too.

This is good stuf!  I'll put it in my quick lunch rotation."}
{"text":"We had two amazing items:  the beetball sandwich and salmon dog.  They were very unique and wonderful.  We topped them off with a few local microbrews.  The rest of the menu looked interesting as well.  The only complaint was that they had the window doors open to celebrate a warmer, sunny day after such a hard winter, but it really wasn't warm enough for that and I was very cold!  Not a big deal and we are looking forward to trying this place again!"}
{"text":"I have a mixed review. I love the food and the concept of doing hot dogs in a special way. And what we ate was well done. I just could not get over how dirty the seating area was. I also saw the person taking our orders and exchanging money being the prepping the food after it came off the grill. I can't help but think that is not very clean. I hope they will change the way they work. It will give me more confidence to come back and enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"Two stars for the concept, we wanted to like you and appreciate these types of restaurants in Pittsburgh.  We have visited three times and all three were letdowns in different ways.  The menu holds promise with the styles of dogs, the interior has an interesting mix of ambiance and décor.

For five or six bucks a specialty hot dog, there better be some differentiation, and unfortunately it is just not there.  You would think the dogs would be high quality made in house or at least by a local butcher, we saw them opening packages of the same hot dogs you could find in a supermarket.  The fries we tried twice, both times the gravy was off tasting and overly salty.

The last time we ordered a corn dog in addition to several other varieties.  The disinterested waiter brought a veggie dog instead, which we tried to stomach but was terrible.  At the same time the other food was cold, I find it difficult to understand how a single cook in an empty restaurant can send out wrong and cold food (you put chili on pre cooked hot dogs all day).  Perhaps she was too concerned about applying the perfect ribbon of mustard."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a good hot dog.  And with the options for hot dogs here, you can call me the hugest sucker in the world.

I only just visited this place for the first time last week and I'm hooked.  In the two visits, I have had three of their unique dogs.  And all I can say is \"OH MY GOD!\"  They are so good and so worth it.  Each hot dog can be customized several different ways to your liking from the type of dog you get, to the bun it's on.

The three dogs I tried were the Pittsburgh, Memphis and Mexican.  All unique in their own sense and all righteously delicious.  The Pittsburgh features a smashed pirogi and cole slaw.  The Memphis features BBQ sauce and potato sticks.  The Mexican features fresca salsa, fresco queso and guacamole.  Each mixes the different flavors perfectly.  And each satisfies just as perfectly.  Each time I had a dog I also ordered the pomme frites with a different dipping sauce, I highly suggest you try the garlic aoili.

The beer selection changes depending on what's in season.  And the selection must be a great when I was in, each time my first option was always gone.

The warmer months allows for the air to flow through here.  The front has garage doors like opening that not only allows the air in, but the noise out.  This also makes for a good time as you can people watch.

Tuesday nights are a great night to stop in here.  Take in a game of \"full contact trivia\" while chowing down on some great food.  Winning gets you either $50 off your tab or a round of free hot dogs for your table."}
{"text":"Did Sunday brunch. Was different but excellent and more quality than quantity which I like to see.
Pomegranate salad was excellent.
The frank breakfast was apparently good.
Recommend and no queues like coco"}
{"text":"Update:  I've eaten here numerous (birthday, lunch, dinner...) times.  Even drove 40 minutes (from Monroeville) craving a hotdog.  Tonight my coworker picked up our evening meal.  He wasn't sure of my order and called for verification.  When he returned, my order was wrong.  It was a beef hotdog (I'm vegan) and fries.  I called Franktuary , spoke with Sarah, left work and  drove back.  She had a vegan hotdog  waiting for me.  I asked for new fries, since mine were cold.  Her answer \"I can only give you a hotdog.\"  I turned and began walking away.  Sarah stops me at the door.  What does she do?  She shows me the order and insists my coworker told her wrong.  I tell her \" I'm a regular there, good customer service would of been replacing the entire order and I won't be returning.\"  She then says \"I can reheat your old fries.\"  SERIOUSLY?  No thanks.  Drove back eating a warm dog and gagging on cold fries.  *DISAPPOINTED*"}
{"text":"Picture the scene.  A beautiful spring day.  A coworker and I decided, \"What better way to spend the lunch hour than dining al fresco and enjoying the delectable properties of fine encased meats?\"  Now I'm really a Wiener World kinda girl, but my coworker really had the taste for fine hotdogs served out of the back of a church.

So let's see, which particular blend of sodium and nitrates appealed to Susan's palatte?  The Locavore looked tempting.  The Imposter (a veggie dog)?  Uh, no thanks!  The Chicago Impostor?  Possibly.  The Buffalo?  Hmmm, a dog with blue cheese and buffalo wing sauce!  The New Yorker?  A dog with 'kraut AND onion sauce?  Hey, now we're talkin'!   http://www.franktuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/NY.jpg And with a side of coleslaw and pickle spear!  Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and enjoy their menu selection. They have a bunch of great themed nights like trivia, waffle, and a TV dinner night where they serve their twist on the old school microwave meal. The hotdogs are good and they also have a vegan dog which is a nice addition. They also have Poutine, which is delish. I know it used to be served with vegan gravy, but I'm not sure if that's the case still. I love their regular lunch/dinner menu! No complaints! 

They also do brunch on the weekends with a changing menu each week. When I went, the service was really slow. Our waiter was pretty attentive, but it took at least a half hour to get our meals. 

I got the Sweet Potato Poutine which was yummy and full of great flavors. The sweet potato hash browns were really overcooked though and way more crispy than I would have liked. The drizzle of coconut creme, sausage, cranberry sauce, and fried egg helped make up for the dry potato, but it would have been amazing if the potatoes weren't so overcooked. the brunch menu has a lot of amazing options (I had trouble picking! I wanted them all!), but the execution seems to be lacking a little. 

I'd definitely go back again though to give the brunch another shot since the menu changes every weekend. 

Regular Menu: 4 stars
Brunch: 3 stars"}
{"text":"So, I've been known to roll my eyes when anyone mentions Franktuary. See, I hate pretentious food. And I certainly don't need a pretentious hot dog. I mean, it's a damn hot dog, right? 

BUT today I went to the L-ville location with some friends for brunch. And the brunch was pretty darn good. I had the Tres Tacos and my only complaint about the food was that my corn tortillas kept falling apart - but that is always my complaint with tacos on corn tortillas, so it's just the nature of the beast. All of our entrees came with a caprese salad which was a nice touch. The tacos were tasty, the tomatoes were heirloom and the coffee was decent. Our service was good.

I have one other small complaint, and this is really just me being whiney. I understand the theme of the place. It's called Franktuary, so there are churchy bits and whatnot. But I really, REALLY wish restaurants would stop using old church pews for seating. It is NOT comfortable. I suppose for young little hipsters who don't have back problems yet [the majority of their clientele], it's fine, but for old ladies like me...ugh. Seriously, those damn pews are the worst.

I'd previously only eaten their food from the Franktuary truck, and it's been a long time since I've done that, so I will definitely go back and give their pretentious hot dogs a shot before I truly pass judgment on them. Because, that's what JC would do."}
{"text":"It's about time I shout out my favorite lawrenceville restaurant! Let me start by saying that I'm vegetarian. There is nothing I love more than having more than 3 options to chose from on a menu. Nearly everything Franktuary offers can be made either vegan or vegetarian. (Hot dogs, sausage, chili, bacon...you name it!) On our most recent visit, we had the pleasure of sitting at the bar and being served by Jake. Jake was extremely knowledgeable about not just the beverage side of things, but also the food offerings. He picked out my husbands entire meal (on request) and made the perfect choices for him! I had a \"Larryville mule\" which was perfection, while my husband stuck to the beer menu. While the vegan sausage is not my style, I absolutely love the tofu dogs. I have it with several different toppings, as well as in corn dog form, and I've loved them every time. Do I even need to mention the variety of dipping sauces?! It's clear that Franktuary cares about using the highest quality, local ingredients and I really appreciate that! I would highly recommend you stop by if you haven't already. (Or, take on the food truck!!)"}
{"text":"Yummy! They offer vegan hot dogs and vegan beet balls - which are fantastic. I would go back and get just the beet balls and not even bother with the hot dogs. The veggie dog was made to be like a real hot dog - it was made of soy and not mashed up vegetables, which I kind of was not expecting. The whole concept of a sit-down hot dog restaurant is weird, but it is cheap and good so I am not complaining. Would go back as a grab-a-bite type of deal, and I would probably just get the beet balls."}
{"text":"2 separate types of veggie dogs.. enough said! I had to try the place! Franktuary has a nice menu with lots of vegetarian/vegan options and decent list of crafts on tap. We started with the deep fried pierogies appetizer which was meh..ok. So here's the thing.. they just have the one \"preset\" veggie dog on the menu but their 'make your own dog' section and it's several toppings and options make the possibilities endless. The nice thing is that you can pick as many toppings as you want for no extra cost! I made my own with the veggie Italian sausage dog, garlic aioli, cheese and grilled onions. Our waitress was super sweet but didn't have any recommendations for me as I wasn't sure what goes with an Italian sausage dog! Obviously, being vegetarian I've never eaten Italian sausage so I went with my gut. It came out ok.. but not quite perfect. Our waitress was happy to bring me extra sauces/toppings on the side to 'fix' it which was nice. Try their blueberry honey mustard sauce. They have vegan bacon too but sadly had run out when we visited. The Mac n cheese is simple but yum! Overall, I liked Franktuary but there's room for improvement. I wish they had more preset veggie dogs on their menu or at least recommendations about what toppings go with what!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today. It definitely wasn't worth $9 for a hot dog and crap fries. The hotdog wasn't even one of those good ones, I could toast a bun at home. Definitely not worth the money. Cool  spot though, some good beers on tap but that's about it. 

As my wife says I also got an Ice tea, so now it is worth the $9. My bad for not realizing the ice tea was valuable."}
{"text":"I enjoyed dinner here. I didn't expect it to be as busy as it was and there was a wait for a table. That is a good thing I imagine. We sat at the bar and were served right away. The selection offers a lot of variety for a \"hotdog\" place. I would definitely suggest upgrading your hot dog from a standard dog regardless of your choice of style."}
{"text":"We used to love Franktuary but our last visit was just ok. The biggest problem was that it took a total of 1.5 hours to eat a few hotdogs, it was long for my 3-year-old. The draft list was pretty unremarkable, would have liked to see more interesting local beers. We ordered the pierogis, it was served without butter or onions or anything like that. Super bland. My son's Mac and cheese was mushy. The hot dogs were fine, and the poutine was awesome."}
{"text":"Warning to vegetarians who want a classic hot dog without the guilt: The vegan tofu dog is no better than the Smart Dogs that Trader Joe's sells - it lacks the taste and texture of real hot dogs. I will say, though, that the jalapeño poppers are excellent!"}
{"text":"You can get much better dogs for a lot cheaper elsewhere. This place is way too hipster. Try Weiner World or the Original in Oakland."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today.  Had a Boylan Birch Beer (probably the best ) coupled with the Pittsburgh dog.  The dog comes with pirogis and coleslaw and I had the upgraded all beef New Zealand Frankfurter.  It was good.  The dog is a little skimpy but the casing has serious snap.  The slaw is fresh and delicious, but was piled on a bit too high.  The pirogis were a great addition.  

There was also a post meal hot dog shaped gummy treat. 

The next time I go i think I will get two standard chili dogs and review from there."}
{"text":"This was exactly the type of place I've been searching for in downtown Pittsburgh. Happened to be in the area for lunch, had a Groupon - solid. The menu, while not huge, was a bit daunting at first but only because I had never been there. I let the fellow working the register know that and he, in addition to complimenting me on my Nine Inch Nails sweatshirt, helped me out and offered some recommendations. Ended up getting the locavore dog, Italy style. He also suggested the chile as a side, which ended up being my favorite part of the meal. It's a nice cozy place with free WiFi and everyone was as nice, easy-going, and friendly as you'd hope for. Will return in a heartbeat when I'm in the area for lunch again. Loved it, loved it, loved it."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal, but there wasn't a wow factor. I ordered the Chicago style dog and another which I can't remember right now. The poutine fries were good and we had kim chi fried balls which were good, but left kind of a weird after taste. Our waitress was super nice and accommodating and the space is very open and inviting."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since they opened. It's nice to see new interesting places to eat popping up in downtown. And Franktuary is one of them. I had the pierogi dog and the Chicago imposter. I moved to pgh from Chicago and it's great that I have an option for Chicago style food. The staff is really nice and friendly. The second time I went I dined in the restaurant and had a cocktail, the church wine punch, and it was pretty good. 

It seems like a soft opening for this location. Often times when I walk by it appears empty. When I dined in, there were only a few patrons. They're a new kid on the block and I'm sure things will begin to pick up in the coming weeks. 

If you're craving a hot dog, beer or cocktail and want a casual place to relax in, check this spot out."}
{"text":"My fave hot dogs in Pennsylvania (so far), great dogs, good prices, great service. Yum yum. The only problem is, if you're dating a guy named Frank from Pittsburgh, chances are he won't be well groomed at all. (Frank-too-hairy). Ba-dum-bum.

The dogs do take awhile to make, but they are certainly worth it! Pitt isn't famous for it's hot dogs like, say, New York, or Buffalo, or the streets of LA, or in particular Chicago, are, but if a dog is what you want in Western PA, this is the place to come. Very friendly, good selection, and very delicious, and it definitely has that local-y vibe to it. It also has that student-y vibe.

Perhaps because dogs in this part of the world are a hot (no pun intended) commodity, they are a little pricey, but a pricey dog is only one dollar more expensive than a cheap dog, really, since dogs are so cheap anyway.

I have a crush on the girl who served me.

Excellent, overpriced hot dogs, delicious to the last bite, get the locally raised ones, super juicy, I highly recommend it. I lowly recommend it too, if I'm lying down. The people who work herre are really friendly and the girls are cute. 5/5"}
{"text":"Let me start this review off by saying I can't wait to go back! This morning I was meeting some girlfriends for brunch at Cocoa Cafe, but the hostess there couldn't even give us an estimate of when a table for 6 would be available. So, we crossed Butler to Franktuary, and I'm so happy we did! We were seated right away, key because we were starting to get hungry at this point. My meal was delicious, bacon, eggs, and French fries sounds like the perfect brunch to me! Those French fries are so delicious too, this is why I'm so excited to go back, would love to try more! I would recommend the Brunch Punch too, but also my friends had some bloody Marys that looked amazing. Our waitress, Delaney I believe, was wonderful! I can't say enough about this place!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I was upset about the happy hour change, but I happened to stop in the other day for a drink and I was pleasantly surprised. With my drink I got free home-made chips which were very good. Although this is not half-price poutine, it made my experience more enjoyable and I feel that Franktuary have redeemed themselves."}
{"text":"Franktuary is appropriately named. Amid the hustle and bustle of Downtown Pittsburgh, this hot dog-selling sanctuary was a cute little place to unwind. Located in the basement of Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, Franktuary is warm and cozy with awesome background music (alt. rock mostly).

I ordered the Thai'd Up Frank, which had Sriracha, chopped peanuts, mango, and cilantro, among other things. It was creative and satisfying, although I was a little put off by the cold mango and the warm hot dog combination. I like my food to share temperatures. Otherwise I would've given this place 5 stars.

The service was excellent, and the presentation was adorable. My food tray consisted of my hot dog, a hand wipe, and a complimentary gummy hot dog candy for dessert."}
{"text":"The place was empty (other than another table) when we went for a late-ish lunch. I had the Québécoise poutine and the Texan frank with Italian sausage. It tasted very good but it wasn't enough :( Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Leszek and I are drawn to Lawrenceville, somehow we always end up on Butler Street. It is becoming one of our favorite streets. We ventured into Franktuary on a warm summer afternoon. We found a church themed restaurant with craft cocktails, draft beers, and a menu with some interesting options. 

We sat at the bar and ordered a Stone Chipotle porter and a Caipirinha. I loved the spicy kick of the beer. The Caipirinha traditionally made with limes, sugar and Casacha was not so good. I think the bartender added club soda, so it was not what I expected.

The menu offered meatballs, sausage, chili, salads and more. Being the healthy freak that I am I was considering one of their salad options, what was I thinking! I ordered the turkey hot dog PA Dutch style with apple onion jam, melted cheddar and green onions. The roll was fresh and the first bite of the hot dog was surprisingly tasty, good flavor combos. We also had the Texan, a beef dog with chili, cheese and Jalepenos. What the hell, we ordered Poutine Philadelphie, frenchfries covered in cheese, gravy, peppers and onions.....oh my guilty conscious....but what a treat. I usually stray from unhealthy foods but at Franktuary I said fuck it and indulged and enjoyed! Take my advise, leave your healthy eating habits at the door and enjoy what Fracktuary has to offer. You won't be disappointed.

Come warm weather the front loading dock doors open up to let in the fresh air. If you want you can sit at a bar that over looks the side walk. If you want, order another hotdog, different flavor :)"}
{"text":"The best hot dog I ever had...no joke!   I was a little on the fence about this place.  I mean, it's hotdogs.   There really isn't a way to make a hot dog amazing.    Or is there?   I stand corrected.

I ordered the grass-fed beef dog Pittsburgh style.  It sounds gross...slaw, pierogis, and ranch dressing with a hog dog on a potato bun.  What possessed me to order it, I do not know.   But it was awesome.  The dog was perfect on a perfect potato bun...and the toppings worked.   Total surprise.   I followed that up with a little dessert - some sort of apple caramel thing the size of a cupcake with fresh whipped cream.  It was the perfect amount of food and was delicious.  The dog came to $5.50 with another $3 for the dessert.  That was enough honestly, but I might throw in a side of fries next time just because they looked good.  

Why only four stars?   Two things.   I ordered a salad, which was pretty lackluster and skimpy.   A couple small dots of goat cheese and some tiny bits of stone fruit with a mound of lettuce.  Not at all worth the $8 and not what I pictured reading the description.   The other thing was the bar.  I was in a Captain and Coke kind of mood.   They didn't have Captain.   OK...not every bar carries it.  I'll live with Sailor Jerry.   The kicker at the bar though was the SLOOOOOOOOW service.  Drinks took forever to get to the table.  I ordered a refill at the beginning of the meal and got it after we'd all finished everything.  My companions then decided that they'd have a round to go with my drink, which I finished before their drinks arrived.  I wanted another, but we'd have gone on like that all night."}
{"text":"I LOVED THIS PLACE! They had options other than their hot dog options (mac n cheese, chicken sandwiches, etc.) What I thought was super funny was their \"Create your own hotdog\" section and the options they had. They had the traditional toppings but they also added chocolate sauce, different cereals, ice cream, etc. I'm sure most people don't add those but I thought it was hilarious and really added a lot of character and humor to their menu. Our server was very friendly and helpful when it came to building our own, and offered great suggestions. They had tables you can sit at as well as a bar where they had a TV that had the pens game on. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the good- The location is great and the atmosphere is pleasant and fun. I'm super sensitive to gluten, so was happy to find that they have gluten-free dogs and buns. Not only that, but the kitchen keeps everything separate, so you don't have to worry about cross-contamination. The staff is super friendly and made me feel very confident that I would not leave sick (this is so rare and much appreciated!) Unfortunately, the food just isn't anything special. The dogs are so small that they really get lost in the bun. They aren't big and juicy, just little grocery store size dogs. The toppings aren't particularly generous either. The GF buns are dry (they don't have to be; I make these same Udi's buns at home and they're moist and fluffy if you steam them). I think people have come to expect a lot even of your standard fare, like hot dogs, and this just doesn't measure up. I wish they were jazzed up a little, a little more substantial; I didn't feel like much effort was put in. With their nice space, friendly staff, and conscientious kitchen, I'm sure they could turn things around!"}
{"text":"Good, tasty food options at a reasonable price and in a nice place. I like the salads (though miss the one they had with corn a few months back) and as a non-vegan who nonetheless often opts for vegan appreciate the dawgs.

I wish they had a slightly larger tap offering.

Drew's Tuesday quiz is great fun - it's one of my favorites around, and it's written by him."}
{"text":"I don't eat hot dogs at restaurants, but was dragged reluctantly. We (my lovely wife) stopped in for lunch a couple of weeks back and I wanted to post a review. Service was great! These folks can take a hot-dog and make it taste like chopped fillet! Good pour on the drinks. Nice atmosphere. Good prices. Go - you won't be sorry"}
{"text":"So-so food and pretty overpriced. Pretty underwhelming after 3-4 visits. An okay place to take visitors from out of town, but I am certainly not in a rid to spend $50+ for two people to eat hot dogs and have a few beers..."}
{"text":"Excellent Chicago dog, their church punch is pretty yummy too."}
{"text":"We are originally from Chicago and are hot dog people so we were excited to try a hot dog dive.  We had 3 different specialty dogs with locavore's, The Chicago, Mexican, and Italian.  All were great even though I was disappointed that there wasn't an open fire charring the hot dogs.  The Chicago was close and the other two were very good except that they were out of guacamole for the mexican.  I would definitely go back if I can get downtown during mid-day."}
{"text":"Wow. A girl really can have it all. This place has delicious poutine, vegan hot dogs, & incredible cocktails. Great place for vegans, vegetarians, & meat eaters alike."}
{"text":"Maaaan. I find myself craving their vegan sausage at weird moments in my life. But seriously the vegan sausage and vegan chili are bomb.com. Poutine is alright I just like my cheese curds fried. Nice to have a place with a good beer selection, comfy atmosphere, that caterers to vegan and meat eaters!"}
{"text":"I do not think I can give this more than 3 stars because quite frankly (no pun intended), they were out of everything we wanted to order!  

I was so excited to come here, and experience what looked like a cool space, and I was underwhelmed.  The service was awesome... she made the best of what was not 86ed and made recommendations and was super pleasant and fast given how busy they were.  

I am a basic dog person, so nothing I had was going to knock it out of the park so to speak, but my husband said his were good.  His buddies veggie sausage item was apparently awesome.  The boring fries were good (with sea salt) BUT they were tiny... almost bite size (so I am guessing we were getting what was the remnants of larger fries that went to other people from the batch).  

We will go back and try everything that they were out of sometime.  Hopefully next time they will have what we really want :)  The meatballs in particular."}
{"text":"Franktuary to me is a place that is great to stop at for a quick bite when in the area.  However, I was expecting more from the food.

It is a pretty cool atmosphere inside.  The bar area is set off from the main dining area and it has an old school feel to it.  I would definitely like to come back and try some of their unique drinks.  I had a root beer which they had on tap and it was one of the best root beers I have ever tasted.  This was a great start to the experience, unfortunately it kind of went downhill from there.

The service was a little odd.  Our server was very awkward and barely spoke.  Further, she forgot a side of ours and I had to go to the kitchen to get it.  She then forgot silverware and I had to go get that myself as well.  When we were done she just put down the check and walked away, no words at all.

For an appetizer I ordered the fried pretzel bites which comes with 2 different mustard types.  The spicy mustard was delicious.  The fried pretzels, while different, were just kind of average.  They seemed over cooked and lacked flavor.  

For my main meal I went with the New Yorker hot dog.  The hot dog itself was cooked well and had a nice snap to it.  Despite this, the toppings seemed to overpower the hot dog.  It was just a little too much and I could barely taste the actual dog.

I would like to come back.  The menu has a lot of options so hopefully I just need to try something else."}
{"text":"well being a pescatarian(eat fish) (ova lacto) eat eggs and cheese things... hot dogs with the fixings is usually not on my menu except for the store bought veggie corn dog products.
and here is Franktuary just waiting for those craving a good ol fashion hot dog with the fixings
yes any of the dog or franks can be veggie not something all ready set up but a nice hot fresh they make them in house veggie corn dog and man that big dog loved with \"corn breading \" and yes of course on a stick!
SO good
let me tell of the good doggies we ate that evening 
a good old fashioned frank with kraut and mustard on a most soft delish roll
its a big bite and oh so good. The brown mustard had a nice bite to it
I am trying t describe the hot dog heaven of my youth ...yes its that good
we also had perogies 3 little fried pillows of potatoes 
they were tasty not the best I ever ate but still very tasty
my kid had a traditional dog and loved it 
our fries we learned in Pittsburgh they appear to be fresh cut and soft 
its seems to  be the way of the fry here in this great city
service was very friendly
there are many offerings of Franks with all sorts of toppings
these doggies are not cheap but they are worth it"}
{"text":"We were drawn into Franktuary on a late night stroll and I'm quite happy we made the stop. Our waiter, Mike M., was great about answering our questions about the menu and giving us speedy, friendly service. We ordered a beer, a Ginzer mixed drink, poutine and 2 hot dogs. 

We found out after ordering they have a happy hour from 10pm-12am on Fridays and Saturdays Saturdays and what we ordered happened to be included. I was very happy to see our meal was only $21! The poutine was delicious, especially combined with the garlic aioli sauce on the side. Their fries are REALLY GOOD. I had the buffalo fries before and they were great also. 

I would say the hot dogs are just OK. A bit pricey when it isn't happy hour. I went with potato bread which I thought was much better than the whole wheat my boyfriend had. We both went with beef dogs and I think they're either boiled or maybe just not as grilled as I like them...wasn't too impressed with the dog itself.  The Pittsburgh topping that I ordered included a pierogi and coleslaw. Despite being made with vegan mayo, the coleslaw was pretty good! The pierogi was nothing special. My boyfriend ordered the Reykjavic topping (remoulade, onions, ketchup, mustard and onion crunch) which I thought was a great topping. 

They have a lot of vegan and gluten-free options and even have a statement on the menu about working around dietary restrictions. I'd probably give it another try during happy hour, but it's a bit pricey for an OK hot-dog otherwise."}
{"text":"I've visited Franktuary's food truck and restaurant, and been very pleased both times. The vegetarian hot dogs are great, although I highly recommend getting plenty of toppings - I don't know that they'd stand up to just ketchup. The topping creations are always interesting and delicious. In terms of price, I think they are pretty reasonable. The only menu item I wish they'd add? Vegetarian poutine! Come on, Franktuary, I want me some cheese curds.

Happy hour is also great - I am a fan of $4 drafts. Just wish I could get in on that 1/2 off poutine.

Edit: I have been informed (on a comment to this review) that the gravy is vegetarian! So, I went back and tried it out, and it was delicious, rich, mushroomy and creamy. So happy I finally got to satisfy my need for poutine!"}
{"text":"Fun spot for creative hot dogs. Garbanzo fries were interesting. A definite must try if in the area."}
{"text":"I guess I should congratulate Franktuary for serving the third best hot dog in Pittsburgh.  What a HUGE disappointment!  How can a place that claims to honor the hot dog serve such a bad dog?  Regardless of the topping the physical wiener is the heart of it all. This one just doesn't cut the mustard.  It is thin, bland, was missing that delightful snap and was so small that it seemed to swim in the bun.

My wife and I both ordered a beer and a hot dog while there.  I had the Chicago Impostor and she had the Mexican.  The city of Chicago should mourn that someone would liken this offering to their glorious dog.  Because the wiener is so small it had too many toppings.  The toppings also sucked.  Halved cherry tomatoes and a gross relish.  As for my wife's mexico dog she said that she couldn't really remember much about it 45 minutes after we ate.  That should say it all.  The poutine fries we tried were also overly salty.

I guess my problem with this and a lot of the hipster restaurants in the Lawrenceville area is that no one cares if it is local and sustainable if it isn't good or better than the original. 

One final note, I found it offensive to chefs around the world that the guy making poutine and hot dogs felt the need to rock a chef's coat.  I guess if I have white jump suit and a model rocket I can call myself an astronaut"}
{"text":"Overall, a welcome addition to the Lawrenceville scene.

Drink-wise, they had a nice selection of beer and excellent cocktail menu. I also liked their selection of draft and bottled sodas that they could customize into various creations for you. 

The hot dogs are excellent.  The fries are decent (nothing special), as was the poutine. 

The service both times I have been here has been attentive and helpful.

I hope they remain a fixture on Butler Street!"}
{"text":"I went on a Tuesday, trivia night. I didn't even know trivia was happening that night, but I'm so glad I stayed!! Good atmosphere, good food, and great service!!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to make it to a 'gourmet' hot dog place in Pittsburgh ever since I visited one in Chicago.  

I loved the menu.  Some great drink options as well.  Got there late-ish.  Maybe 9:00 on a Saturday.  Looked like a nice crowd, but no wait.  Got good service and really enjoyed the food.

I got the Pittsburgh dog, (pierogie and slaw) and loved it.  Kind of a primanti's goes to Poland feel.  Vinegar slaw with red cabbage paired well.  

Poutine (Québecois) had a lot of pepper and thyme, but on a cold winter night it hit the spot.

From the bar, I got a \"Nuts for Fall\"...house alond bourbon, house cinnamon apple shrub, bourbon barrel aged maple syrup, Peychaud's.  It was good, but not great, and I was already mildly intoxicated.  I figured I'd quit while I was ahead and left half of it behind.

It was a nice departure from some of the haute cuisineries (yeah...I'm sticking with that) I've been frequenting lately, and proves you don't have to be fancy to be good."}
{"text":"I'm still on the fence about this place, but here are some observations:

Franktuary is generally vegan friendly, but the menu lacks informative labeling (as some meat eaters have also pointed out). 

The veggie dogs are the same boring dogs you can get anywhere, but the different executions make them slightly more interesting. I haven't tried the veggie sausage, I think it might have egg in it (example of how a menu indication could be useful). 

Beet balls = yum! 

Garbanzo fries, also a hit! 

Some of the cocktails are way overpriced. The \"Refugio\" is a nice enough mezcal drink, but it's $14 and not up to par with Salt or Cantina's less pricey concoctions. It was not particularly strong, like a mezcal drink should be; it was rather on the sweet side and was lacking the bitter and sour elements of the grapefruit ingredient. Plus, it is served in a coupe with a plastic straw, which seems tacky and pointless (the straw). I had another even less impressive drink there on my first visit, which I cannot remember...The bartender seems sincere in his efforts, so I hope he can fine tune things a bit, and get the prices in line."}
{"text":"Yes, this place is a little expensive for a hot dog, but dayum they make good hot dogs.

I had a Locavore dog (all-beef mad from local grass-fed organic beef) on my Chicago Impostor and it was delicious.  It'll make you think twice about the kind of hot dogs you buy in the grocery!

My only complaint is that Franktuary should diversity its bun options, there's a new place in DC that has a variety of good buns from texas toast to pretzel rolls!"}
{"text":"Wonderful spot that serves up more than hot dogs. It's essentially a cool, local casual restaurant that serves great hotdogs and casual american food. It's not, to the chagrin of other reviews, just a hotdog shop - in which case, I agree it would miss the mark - it should instead be viewed as a local restaurant that uses high-quality ingredients and happens to specialize in hotdogs. Don't expect to buy your 1 dollar hotdogs here people, you actually sit down in fun restaurant.

The awesome thing about the place is the wide selection of local foods and drinks. Cocktails are prepared well using great local products like Boyd and Blair vodka, Wigle whiskey, and Maggie's Farm rum.  They make made-to-order spritzers with a variety of combinations, which are great for the summer.

The food is superbly prepared. The meatballs are excellent and the fries well-prepared. Hotdogs were well-prepared with a variety of interesting and traditional toppings. In addition, our service was great. The waitress was knowledgeable and friendly. Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is fun. Nothing to complain about whatsoever. Will definitely return and try some more things."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how excited I was to go to this place!

And unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations, but maybe that's my fault.

Being the Instagram food junkie that I am, I follow Franktuary and saw that on Friday, they serve a Fried Fish Sandwich! Having also just recently become Catholic, I was pummmppped for my first fish-initiation, and gathered up my fellow Catholics to head over for that sandwich I had been salivating over all day. 

When we got there, it seemed busy, but luckily, they seated us right away! I was one step closer to my fish. It wasn't listed on the menu, but they had all of these topping \"styles\" that normally go on their normal menu items, like pierogies and all kinds of sauces that you could add to your sandwich. 

I am a plain jane, so I just ordered my fish straight up on a bun, with a side of fries. My cohorts got a fish sandwich, grilled cheese style, which looked amazing, fried pierogies, and a fish sandwich on a lettuce boat with homemade chips and pickles.

Well. Mine was dry, again, maybe my fault for ordering it plain, but the flavor of the fish was also lacking for me. But that BUN DOE. It was to die for, I think potato bread, and I could have eaten a whole bucket of their homemade, skin-still-on French fries. 

My friend loved her grilled cheese fish sandwich and both the pierogies & homemade chips were good (not as good as the fries though), but THOSE PICKLES. I wouldn't touch them, or sniff them, for that matter, with a ten foot pole. They tasted like straight vinegar and dirty socks. 

And maybe the most disappointing factoid of the night was that they seemed to have taken a very serious stance on the Coke vs Pepsi issue and just decided to nix both altogether! When I asked which they had, the waitress kindly pointed to their hipster list of only $3 special, almost tastes like good pop you know and love, but not quite, pop. All 3 of us seriously considered whether that was a deal breaker for us or not to get up and walk out. I ordered the Boylan's Cola, and I am glad I did, because the acid from it was the only thing that drowned out the taste of those pickles.

The place was very cool looking, very church inspired, hence frank-TUARY, and I am definitely interested in going back. 

Everyone who ordered the franks looked to be enjoying themselves, and the food looked great, but I would just caution against the fish sandwich, or maybe just add some really great style to cover up the flavor, or lack thereof. 

Feeling optimistic for the future."}
{"text":"I've gone to the truck a few times, always pleased.  I'm so glad they decided to open a brick and mortar in Lawrenceville.  My husband and I went the other week - I believe the week they oepend, but it could have been the week after.  We got some poutine (Quebecoisl) for an appetizer and 2 hot dogs each.  I had the Pittsburgh (perogie, slaw) and the Memphis (BBQ sauce, slaw, potato sticks)...both were very good.  The slaw was crispy.  The poutine...eh...my husband said it was great, but I didn't like the taste of the fries. This was only my third taste of poutine, however, so I may just not know what's what.  However, an arsenal cider and some tasty dogs made for a pretty good dining experience.  I really like how they have options for local grown and/or grass-fed beef.  I hope they do well in this location!"}
{"text":"I ate at Franktuary for lunch today and bought several dawgs for myself and my co-workers. We tried everything from the Veggie and Locavore (organic grass-fed beef) dogs to the Italy, New Yorker and Chicago Impostor. Everybody raved about their choices. I'll certainly be going back on my visits to Pittsburgh and look forward to trying other selections.

This place is one of the types of places that you *want* to support. It's a local joint, with wonderful customer service that's doing something fun and has green choices.

I'm in love...watch out Nathan's..."}
{"text":"I came, I ate a hot dog with pieroges (spelling), I bought a t-shirt. Done and done. They host trivia some nights, so kinda loud. But, great service, a good dog, neat space, good beer options."}
{"text":"Asked our Lyft driver where to get a unique Pittsburgh boozy brunch and this was the first place suggested. I made the huge mistake of not getting the Korean sausage dog my boyfriend did! Ah, so amazing. Glad he saved me a bite. I had the Chicago style, which was nice, but I made the mistake of getting the standard dog (which is as standard as a hotdog can get). Definitely should have gone a more \"sausage\" route. The bloody mary's were really good, though. The service/atmosphere is nice as well. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"HOT DOG!!!!

Check out them beetballs! UMMMM, MMMM! 

Veggie Hot dogs with buffalo wing sauce, chic pea fries, beetballs, & veggie sausage - every hungry vegetarians secret fast food fantasy! :)  

I loved the food, can't say I would want to eat here every day, afraid of the novelty wearing off, but it was really good and I love that they offer Vegan/vegetarian options!  The beer on tap looked very refreshing, next time I'll give it a try with my veggie hot dog!"}
{"text":"Finally went today for lunch!  I've swung by here many times for a scoop of ice cream but finally had the gumption to try some dogs!

As others have mentioned, this is probably an ex-sunday school room in the basement of a church downtown.  Always busy for weekday lunch, despite that the 4 employees are very efficient at what they're doing and you shouldn't have to wait more than 5 minutes or so.

I ordered the Hyprocite: Veggie dog with meat-chili.  It is possible that I should have ordered a regular dog for my first experience, but I have a feeling a veggie dog can say just as much about a joint as veggie dogs vary widely in quality!  I wasn't disappointed, this dog appeared much like regular dog but had the wheat gluten edge and a bit of spiciness.  The aftertaste was almost exactly that of a regular hot dog!  The chili was also good but I could have stood for a lot more.

The buns were good, nothing to get super excited about but fairly solid none the less.  Prices are reasonable and service is friendly."}
{"text":"I'm still hungry...

They charge an extra $1.00 at the food truck for a whole grain bun (looks like the online menu is outdated listing a $.50 upcharge), but it appears to be just regular white bread with some seeds in it.

Can't you offer a 75% to 100% whole wheat option? I can find them at the grocery store."}
{"text":"I think it's such a cool concept and the turkey hotdogs made me want to visit. I tried 2 different hotdogs and poutine fries. Everything was pretty good. Based on the food alone I would go back. It was quite expensive and we even went during happy hour. I can't imagine paying 60 dollars for some hotdogs and 2 drinks each but that is what we did. My main concern was the service. I have worked as a bartender for quite some time before my current career and all I can say is \"ugh\". My husband and I both had to ask for another drink while the bartender played on her phone and stood around and talked to other employees including what I believe was the manager. We both sat with our drinks empty for a good 5 minutes. The worst part was that we were the only 2 people at the bar! During our wait for drinks the bartender's friend walked in... She trotted right past us to serve him and we were left  thirsty while she chatted him up for a few minutes. Overall I would try again but it's disappointing that the service was so very lacking even with a manager right there."}
{"text":"Perhaps my review won't count since I had the \"vegan\" dog and those who opted for the \"real\" thing may have a difference in opinion.  All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by by vegan dog and the fact that I wasn't disgusted by it.  

I had fairly low expectations of a \"vegan\" hot dog but it wasn't bad at all...it actually tasted, looked and had a similar consistency of an all beef hot dog.  I got mine prepared \"Memphis\" style which meant it had cole slaw, bbq sauce and potato sticks as toppings.  I feel like the cole slaw was overwhelming and wish there was more bbq sauce.  

I tried some of the frites which were fresh although there wasn't many to \"share\".  The atmosphere/decor and the type of food you get here don't quite match but it seems to work in an odd way.  I didn't feel strange at all ordering a French 75 with my hot dog!"}
{"text":"We went here prior to a Yelp event at Kiln-N-Time (right up the road on 38th Street, check it out!) and boy we were glad we did!  It was a Wednesday night, around 6PM, and we walked right in getting a cute high top in the front of the restaurant.  They have a garage door, and tonight being a beautiful night, it was wide open encouraging some good people watching on Butler Street!

You pick your base hot dog (standard, grass fed, veggie, etc.) and then you can customize toppings or pick a suggested hot dog with specific toppings.  I tried the Reyjavnik hot dog and found it to be pretty tasty.  This hot dog had mustard, remoulade, ketchup, onion and crispy onions on it.  My boyfriend had the Oahu, and I gotta admit it, but I liked his even better than mine.  The house bacon, teriyaki sauce, grilled pineapple and scallions combination was so delightful with a sweetness but savory quality.  This would be a hard one not to get next time!!  There are so many options though, there will be certainly one for any palate!

The beer selection was small to moderate, but chock full of good options including craft beers.  I tried the Duck Rabbit Milk Stout and found it to be absolutely delicious!  I would definitely get this one again.

The décor is cool.  They have reused pews as the booths. (Get it?  It's like a sanctuary...but a Franktuary!!)

As a lifelong hot dog fanatic, I can't wait to come back to this place over and over again!"}
{"text":"Frankly, I think this joint has a darn good Sunday brunch. Interesting, fun combos of flavors. Bonus on the spiked drinks...second glass is free and you can order one of the other selections. Sweet. Fun decor and our server gets a thumbs up. The chicken and waffle sandwich was yummy and also good deconstructed with a great sweet sauce for dipping. Strawberry glazed mini donuts were a hit and my fav. If wasn't so stuffed would have had a second order for dessert."}
{"text":"The frankturary is a self defined fancy fast food. True, their hot dogs come with combinations more world food like than your regular street cart. However, the food is still fast food and a pricey fast food for that matter. I like my food to be healthy-ish and/or cheap and the Franktuary doesn't qualify for either one."}
{"text":"Vegan New Yorker dog was awesome! My husband loved the Texan with grass-fed beef frank.  Fries were all delicious.  We'll be back. Fun place b"}
{"text":"I feel like there are a lot of hotdogs haters out there, and I just want to speak up for the downtrodden franks. Also, I mean, the name is a fantastic pun and they get bonus points for that. 

I've been to Franktuary for lunch, dinner, brunch, and drinks, and have always had a great experience. I can't recommend just one dog off the menu, since every time I try one, I declare it my new favorite. My top recommendations are: Pittsburgh, Memphis, and Chicago Impostor.  

I know people complain about the pricey wieners, but keep in mind, these are all beef franks, and you also have the option for locally sourced meats. Sure, it's not a $1 cart dog on the street, but I don't think it ever claimed it was. 

When I go to brunch, I can't help but order whatever brunch poutine they have cooked up. That choice has ever done me wrong--but I find the regular poutine's gravy a bit too salty and steer clear of that as a dinner option. 

This place is great to bring just about anyone. Foodies love it, my Mom loves it, my vegan cousin tolerates it, and I regularly meet for after work drinks there (great food specials during happy hour 4-6). The staff is always friendly, and the events they hold always look fun (must get to a crossword night soon!)

I hope I've set the haters straight, if you love a hotdog, or even just have lukewarm feelings towards the thing--you're gonna love it here."}
{"text":"Went to Franktuary for the first time today with my girlfriend and was overall disappointed.

The building itself is pretty cool. I like that they kept the refurbished church look considering the original place. Lots of room to move, pretty comfortable seating for hardwood, and nothing was crazy wobbly or broken. Only downside would be that since the front is all glass it got a little chilly up front, but that's common sense so seat yourself appropriately.

Our server was good. Quick, attentive, not.overbearing, all good. Not sure about the cocktails, but me and my girlfriend both got a laugh out of how AWFULLY the bartender pulled a draft. Good lord, she must've had 2in of foam once it was all said and done, so be aware. The beer selection is pretty good though and all local or at least from PA (today. Wouldn't be shocked if it changed)

As for the food it was good if you understand and accept the following:
1) the menu is 90% hotdogs and there really isn't enough you can do to a frank to make it but so different.

2) unless you don't eat much, have the cash to burn, or go during happy hour you're not eating to get full.

3) these are REGULAR size franks with a very irregular price tag.

Don't get me wrong, the hotdogs were delicious, but when they START at $3.50 before any condiments I expected a sizable dog. That wasn't the case. On top of that all sides are separate, which is fine, but $4 for the equivalent of a medium fry at Mcdonald's is absurd. I know how much food costs and you can afford to give a basket of fries for the sae price unless you don't know where to buy affordable ingredients. For a down-under dog, a veggie sausage, fries and a beer I spent $22 and was hungry again within a couple hours.

It's a cool spot, great if you don't mind spending the money for a pretty light meal, also great if you go during happy hour (4pm-6pm, 1/2 price dogs, $2 drafts), but unless that's the position I'm in I can't see myself ever going back. You just do not get enough for your money and thats enough reason for me."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and it's a story of two COMPLETELY seperate experiences.   This is the reason for the 3 stars, if I was rating it as a hot dog place alone for ONLY the food I would give an additional, HOWEVER the last time I went the service was terrible.    

Lets stay positive for the top part of the review, because I don't want to sound negative off of a single experience.    The hot dogs/sausages are fantastic.    They have choices that go beyond normal fare with grass fed beef, and locally sourced sausage, as well as topping beyond ketchup and mustard.     They also offer a variety of poutine (essentially fancy loaded french fries).   Their beer selection is also nice posting rotating craft beers and some consistent favorites. 

The last time however I went we had a waiter who wrote nothing down, something that bothers me to begin with, and then proceeded to forget to bring things to our table and have to be asked multiple times OR brought incorrect things entirely.     

I'll be honest and will likely try again because these are some good dogs in a fun atmosphere....hopefully I can add my star back."}
{"text":"The PA Dutch is amazing, good fries & drink selection. Plus the decor has this old-church vibe which is really cute. Not really good for more than a two-person group though, as the seating is pretty awkward."}
{"text":"Still loving some of the dogs but you're killing me with your mainstreaming. It's like industry but mostly hot dogs.

But missing the chips :( #SaveTheChips

UPDATE: What's going on in this place? Gummy bears on hot dogs? Can you just roll in a bath tub sundae bar? Jesus Christ what a disappointment. Boylans is gone. The chips are gone. The Texan dog has been replaced with honey and wtfeverelse!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday as part of a food tour. I had been to the Franktuary downtown and enjoyed it and loved seeing a new larger space.  The inside of the restaurant has an industrial feel with functioning garage doors in the bar area and exposed duct work, yet clean and whitewashed.

For our tasting we were served a regular hot dog with some type of satay sauce, poutine and a dressed side salad with cranberries and walnuts.  The hot dog had a nice snap to it and the satay tasted decently with it although it would not have been my personal choice.  The poutine was the classic with a beef gravy and cheese curds and while it tasted decently, I have had better.  Finally the salad may have been the best part of the meal as it was dressed with a sour vinaigrette that worked well with the sweet cranberries and savory nuts.

The bottom line for is that I would head back here again in the future.  While I sometimes have a hard time paying as much for hot dogs as they cost here, they are pretty good and I love their new space."}
{"text":"I ate here this past Friday with a dining partner.  We arrived at 11 for an early lunch and we were the only ones in the restaurant.  I have been here in the past at later times and the line has been pretty long so get their early.  The decor of the restaurant is nothing special but it does scream out local.  It is also cool to see their ticketing system as they have clips attached to a wire and literally and throw it back to the cooks.

I had the both a Buffalo locavore and a Pittsburgh locavore.  The locovore is their organic grass-fed dog from Volant which is fairly close to Pittsburgh.  It it fairly large for a hot dog and has a great taste.  The buffalo dog has a good amount of hot sauce and blue cheese dressing on it, tasted great and was easy to eat.  The same could not be said for the Pittsburgh dog which was topped with a pierogi and so slaw.  I had to eat it all separately as I am not sure I could have fit the dog and toppings into my mouth but it was good.

The bottom line for me is that I really enjoy this place and I am sure that I will be back at some point.  However, it is worth noting that it can get pretty expensive depending on what you order,"}
{"text":"Good yes, great no. The dog itself was firm , overcooked or the casing I don't know. I didn't care for the large bun and ended up not eating most of the bun. Tried the Detroit and Buffalo. Both were good. Liked the sauce on the deroit as it was not chili. 
I will go back to sample the other choices."}
{"text":"No complaints here! Service is always great, changing tables in both the mens and womens rooms, and the food is fantastic! Drinks aren't bad either- both the cocktails and the bottomless Boylan's have always left me feeling satisfied:)"}
{"text":"The dogs are good but I was expecting a better value. Awesome that it is in the bottom of a church. Recommended"}
{"text":"Franktuary - stick to what you do best: hotdogs.  I had brunch here over the weekend and I was 'not impressed'.  
I ordered the Benedict Arnold Poutine.  The hash browns were fried to such a crisp that I could pick it up and pound it on the dish and it wouldn't break.  It was supposed to include bacon - I suppose it was cut up in the mix but you could have fooled me.
Some of my fellow diners ordered from the trinity menu and found themselves still very hungry after eating.  All in all, I would not come back here for brunch.  
The decor is great and our waiter was on the ball refilling drinks and asking if everything was ok.  We had a group of about 7 and it took quite a while to get the food out."}
{"text":"I am not normally the biggest hot dog fan... At a summer picnic, I'm more likely to nibble on chips than chow down on a hot dog and bun. If you feel similarly, Franktuary could change your life!

I fell in love with the restaurant space and decor. It's a good, spacious size without feeling too large. My husband and I came here on Friday night, and the restaurant was busy but wait-free. The decor has a modern but homey and rustic feel. The lighting set the right mood, and I felt very comfortable here. 

Let's discuss the food! My husband and I ordered standard hot dogs on potato buns. I had the PA Dutch (apple onion jam with cheddar)  and tried his Oahu (fabulous pineapple concoction - a special that night) and Bangkok (Thai peanut, carrot, and cilantro). The ingredients were very fresh and an excellent quality while the combinations were unique and delicious. We also split an order of the Poutine Philadelphie, also known as fries smothered in gravy, provolone, peppers, and onions. Though good, the gravy flavor became quite strong to me after several bites. 

Overall, I was very impressed by the restaurant's design and food. I look forward to coming back here again and may even be upgrading my review to 5 stars when I do!"}
{"text":"I found out about the Franktuary when we were planning our trip to the NCAA Hockey Frozen Four and was quite excited at the prospect of eating a good hot dog, something I have not really been able to do for the decade and a half that I have been a vegan. As you can see from my rating, I was not disappointed, nor was my omnivore spouse who enjoyed her conventional dog. We went twice, the second time ordering two dogs each since we observed that to be the norm during our first visit. We had lunch both times, so it was not busy and the service was very good. 

1st Visit: I had the Chicago Imposter, boring fries (nothing on them) and pickles. My wife had the Texan and boring fries. The beer was also good.
2nd Visit: I had the NY & Bangkok dogs & fries with poutine Quebecoise (without the curds). My wife had another Texan and the Chicago, with boring fries and my cheese curds. We used to visit Montreal every year to see baseball and enjoy the excellent food and culture, so having poutine again also sounded interesting and it was. 

We ate too much both times. 

What I really liked were the fixings and presentation for the dogs. All of the ingredients were super. The only obvious area for improvement, and thus the 4 star rather than 5 star rating, is the tofu dog. A good tofu dog is as hard to find as a good vegan pizza with a cheese substitute. Only once in my life have I had either. I have had good fake sausages more often, but those are rare too. Someday someone will figure out how to make a good vegan hot dog ... I hope."}
{"text":"Interesting drinks and plenty of vegan/vegetarian options. You can make your own hot dog, but if you're not feeling a hot dog, there are plenty of other options. Cool vibe and friendly staff! Would definitely come back! The spiked float was to die for. I got it with baileys and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch while I was downtown at a conference during the week.  Got a vegan New Yorker (sauerkraut, vidalia onion sauce, brown mustard), a black cherry Boylan soda, and a side of cole slaw.  

The hot dog was good, the bun was weak, which fell apart when I started eating.  The cole slaw was really good. I would stop in again for a quick lunch if I was downtown, but I might try a different vegan dog.  

Between here and D's for hot dogs...I have to go with D's.  But, if I'm downtown and craving a quick lunch I'd probably stop in again."}
{"text":"Does any food pair better with a nice, cold beer more than a hot dog? Maybe pizza but I doubt it. I used to shuffle myself down to the Oliver street location in a church (get it, Franktuary) when I was a tiny little college girl looking for a good wiener. Now it is 10 years later and with the new Market Square location opening soon, I feel it is appropriate to finally discuss my decade long romance with Franktuary. It's consistent, fresh and simple food that everyone should be able to appreciate. While I get myself a chili cheese dog more times than not, I recently stepped out of the box to try something different and ordered the Portland dog. It had cream cheese, miller's mustard, pickled onions and crispy capers. I took one bite and died. I am currently writing this review from my tomb, patiently awaiting resurrection so that I can eat 50 more. For starters, pickled onions and cream cheese should pretty much be on everything. More importantly, if there is a better thing to do with a caper berry than fry it, I don't care to know. I would fist fight someone over fried capers because they are that good. Why bars do not have bowls of these to munch on, as opposed to boring nuts, I will never know. I thought I was a one hot dog kind of girl. Turns out I was living a lie this entire time."}
{"text":"By far one of best hot dog spots I've had... Kinda cliché because I'm from NY, and we have the oh so amazing street cart dirty water dogs as we call them!! But yea this place was
Good clean and fresh !! I had the NY'r go figure right! But the have other style of
Hot dogs including fish and vegan! So it touches on all ranges of ppl !"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late-ish night snack around 9:30 on a Thursday.  They actually close on 10:30 pm on weekdays, not 11:30 as stated on the Yelp page.  Added a screenshot to confirm for you lazy asses who don't want to click in their website.

Hotdogs are good and decently priced (Around $6-$11 depending on what type of sausage you pick).  Friendly service as well even when we were there near closing time.

Good place to grab a bite at night if you're down for something fancier than Wendy's on Butler"}
{"text":"Great creative dogs! A couple of weeks ago I stopped in and had the special duck sausage. It was tender and well seasoned. Two days ago my run on hot dogs led to the salmon dog with Pennsylvania Dutch Apple/Onion \"chutney\" and Sharp Cheddar Cheese. It was hard to just eat one. But the cold glass of Yard's Love Stout that tastes like a combo of chocolate and coffee helped fill me and cool my jets so I could leave satisfied and not stuffed. Really nice wait staff, bartender, and it was fun to talk to the  crafter of the custom-made dogs as he prepared the dogs in the open kitchen."}
{"text":"Service was great, selection good, but to be honest, the regular hot dog that they serve is a very plain, skinny, Vienna style dogs and the buns are very cheap white buns. The toppings are good but if I went back I would try the locovore (sp?) rather than their regular hot dogs to get some good flavor.

Overall most specialty hot dog places I have gone to have great tasting dogs that they put into a unique tasty bun. Franktuary doesn't have that so I don't really see a need to go back."}
{"text":"Lolz I just came in on Sunday and they said no hot dogs. So wouldn't let this trip go to waste and ordered take-out for two glazed apple doughnuts like a boss. The donuts were cool. Atmosphere was cool too. I imagine this place is a good spot for hot dogs when they have some."}
{"text":"Franktuary is a fun place that sort of bridges between a restaurant and bar vibe. I usually will stroll in during the afternoon for a quick bite and a beer. The brew selection is very good with rotating taps always with some local craft selections. Franktuary also boasts craft cocktails which I have yet to try. 

I guess the hot dogs are sort of pricey for the size ($5-$8), but the toppings and styles are innovative and unique. I've tried the Memphis and a Thai version which were both nice twists on the classic American hot dog. 

The staff is great; friendly with a hint of hipster smugness. Chris the bartender is knowledgeable about the beer and liquor selection. The owner is around frequently and has a knack for customer service.

The restaurant space has a modern flair mixed with an old churchy vibe (ie. stained glass, candles, pews for seating). It is also pretty cool that the customers can see right into the kitchen and watch all the cooks at work preparing the different sauces and hot dogs. 

Franktuary fits right into the up and coming Lawerenceville vibe."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I wondered if the hot dogs would be overpriced, but they were really reasonable. A lot of different styles to choose from.
We didn't get any fries because they were $4 and a small portion. Drinks were pricey too. 
But I'll definitely go back for the hotdogs."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was bad. It was a nice hot day, that had one person doing everything, the service was insanely slow, it took about 10-15 mins as we stood at the counter until someone has even took our order. Then the food took about 20 mins for 2 hot dogs and 1 corndog. The food was average and way overpriced for how it tastes. Definitely never going back."}
{"text":"Their veggie beetballs were pretty good but I would have to say that out of everything that we had I liked the miso kale salad and the poutine soo much more! The poutine was perfect, but the chunks of cheese freaked me out a bit, but I'm definitely coming back to try every single kind of poutine they have. The poutine was made with brown gravy, so fear not vegetarians, this is the dish for you! 

During happy hour their poutine was half off so of course I was a happy girl, but being sick I didn't get a chance to drink any of their cocktails which was a bummer."}
{"text":"Since we don't work downtown, my boyfriend and I arranged to have a lunch at Franktuary on a Friday after his classes were over.  We couldn't find anywhere to park, so I had to pull over on the side of the street with hazards on while he ran in to get our hot dog delights.  Almost fifteen minutes later, he emerged with a paper bag of goodness, and we were out of there!

At home, while we put the foil-wrapped dogs in the heaven to reheat them slightly, he explained to me that it took so long to pick up the dogs because they cook them to order - they aren't pre-cooked and hanging out under a heat lamp.  But there wasn't any line at 1:30 pm on a Friday, so if you take a late lunch, you should be good to go.

We put all the hot dogs on a little plate and cut them all in half, for easy sharing.  Looking back at us was the El Greco (feta and artichoke hearts), the Chicago Imposter (Chicago-style - mustard, relish, onion, banana pepper, celery salt, tomato, and pickle), and the Pittsburgh (a pierogie and cole slaw).  Nom-licious.

Presented, in ascending order of tastiness.
Chicago Imposter - this was, embarrassingly, my first Chicago-style hot dog, and SHAME on me for not having one before despite all my time in the Chi.  This one was my least favorite, but I am unable to determine whether it's because I don't like Chicago style, or because I don't like the way Franktuary does it.  I suspect the former reason - something about the sweetness and the acidity from the relish - I just don't think it's my thing.  I mean, we still ate it - but it was both of our least favorite.

El Greco - Coming in second - who'd have thought of putting feta and artichoke hearts on a hot dog?  Surprise surprise, it works!  One of their simpler dogs, with only two ingredients, this one had good flavor.

Pittsburgh - the absolute undisputed champion.  GO.  EAT THIS.  NOW.  We were both utterly bowled over by how good this one.  We kept exclaiming things like \"this is SO GOOD\" or \"MMMMMMM!\" at top volume.  It's the pierogie.  The cole slaw was very good, but the pierogie seals the deal.  Most brilliant hot dog ingredient ever.  Next time we'll get two of these, one each, and then a third new flavor to try.

I'd recommend one-and-a-half hot dogs per small person, two per everyone else, especially if you aren't getting side dishes.  They go down fast!  Also - the \"normal\" all beef franks are juicy and great - the localvore one is good too, but has a more nontraditional \"meaty\" taste and texture.  I say go for the classic dog, it's a better bang for your buck too!"}
{"text":"Oh franktuary how I love those gourmet style hot dogs! And now you have brunch?!? I can hardly wait for the next Sunday that I am free!

I swear I am also willing to start a petition to have to dubliner permanently added to the menu!

The place isn't huge and some of the booths can feel a little tight but with dogs this good, I'm not really interested in the decor. 

They have a decent wine selection (and yes I like a glass of wine with my hot dogs lol aren't I fancy?? J/k). In all seriousness I adore their hot dogs, love that they have rotating specials and even though they sometimes sound \"interesting\" give one a shot. The flavor combinations are sometimes too complex for me but you never know when you might stumble on your new favorite hot dog!"}
{"text":"This little hipster place offers Frankfurters in a former Church Sanctuary!  Duh. Franktuary.

It's a clever idea, or not, I'm not sure....  We had a New Yorker and a Chicago Imposter dog.  They were OK....  Overpriced if you asked me....

The best thing about this place is the selection of bottled Sodas.  I had a very nice Root Beer."}
{"text":"I went to take my old Trek bike for rehab to send to my daughter in NYC.  I ambled around the region and found this hot dog shoppe.  I ordered chili with jalapeños and a corn dog.  It took forever to get these (2) items and the corn dog was not worth the wait.  The cornbread lacked a sweet and corn flavor.  The chili was good.  I'll probably order this again when I go pick up my boxed up bike. 

PS

I didn't see Ciroc at the bar, but then again I didn't ask.  I have plenty at home:}"}
{"text":"We stopped by for brunch on Sunday morning, and were told there would be a  20-30 minute wait to sit in the dining area, for two people. The bar section however was empty and up for grabs, so we seated ourselves at the bar. The bartender took our order and our food arrived within 15-20 minutes. 

We had the \"Breakfast in Quebec Poutine\" and the \"Return of the Waffle Sandwich\" which were both okay. The poutine was just poutine with 2 fried eggs on it, not really sure why it even made a spot on the Brunch Menu. There was another option for Short Rib Poutine as well. The waffle sandwich that I had consisted of sausage patties, lettuce, tomato, maple aioli, and Belgian waffle. it was a little messy to eat, and to be honest, not that special, maybe it would have been nicer if there was an egg in it.

I wasn't too blown away by this place and would probably just go somewhere else for brunch next time."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time last night. We have been creeping through the windows for a few months while the place was being renovated. It is super nice inside - especially the spacious bar. They have a good selection on tap, a fancy drink list and a pretty decent wine selection. The menu is a bit pricey, but quality. They have a ton of vegan and vegetarian options which is great for me. I also love that the kitchen is surrounded by windows so you can see what's going on. It looks like they have a garage door for the summer. Will definitely be a great spot for us local larryville-ers."}
{"text":"I've been excited to come here for awhile because of their extensive menu options. Whether you are someone who likes a good beef dog, prefers turkey dogs, a vegetarian, or a vegan, there are many options for you!

Off the menu you can go with one of their premade dogs or make your own. The make your own topping list is so long! They have everything on there from onions, to sauces, to SPRINKLES! You can also pick what kind of bun you'd like. I went with the veggie corn dog and a turkey dog with Just ketchup and onions. The turkey dog was delish! I looooved it. The veggie corn dog was not very good. I did not like the flavor of the veggie dog and my breading was soft and limp. I'll take a morning star corndog over this any day. I also had a side of the cole slaw (you can pick creamy or vinegar based), I had vinegar. It was very spicy. I think it would be better on a dog than alone. They had root beer on tap which my husband got and it was so fresh and sweet! 

It's a pretty quick meal without being rushed. We will definitely be back to try the veggie Italian sausage and to get another turkey dog, yum!"}
{"text":"Friday was my first experience with Franktuary and I am a fan of their delicious franks! 
Meeting a friend for dinner, I was skeptical how full I was going to be on hotdogs.  We decided to split some fries and I ordered a Pittsburgher on whole grain.  YUM YUM YUM! The dog was delightful and the bun was fresh.  My dog came with slaw and pierogies (true Pgh fashion)  I really enjoyed it.  I sort of regretted only getting one, but when I was finished I was stuffed.

I love the open set up of this place, and made a mental note that it's a great place to bring a large group. Service was excellent.  

They also have a good beer selection, so I'm always a fan of that. I had to get take out for the bf who was not able to join, and he very much enjoyed the two dogs he had. 

I will definitely be trying the meatballs on my next adventure!"}
{"text":"The food was decent - I had the veggie dogs which were actually really good meat substitutes. 

This is definitely a \"go every now and then\" type of restaurant because I found it to be somewhat pricey for the amount of food given 

I heard the trivia here is a a lot of fun though!"}
{"text":"I went here on Tuesday night for trivia night, and had a great time.  The trivia here is hard, but it was a lot of fun.  We ordered some hot dogs and appetizers while we were here. I think the food is very reasonable priced, and two hot dogs really filled me up.  You have an option to make your own hotdog or to order one of their crafted hotdogs.  The drinks are a little pricey if you are not there during happy hour, but the drink prices are comparable to every other place in Lawrenceville ."}
{"text":"Great place, not Gourmet but fun and they have cider. I love it in the summer when it is all open."}
{"text":"Cool little place with an interesting vibe. Food is limited but good.  I mean it's hotdogs, with a couple other things thrown in. Decent prices, and there is alcohol which is always a plus. Will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Frankturary is awesome! I love the creativity with the hot dogs. As a vegan I appreciate the option for veggie dog. They also offer a grass fed beef. Certainly they know the community they are serving. The truck is also great!"}
{"text":"Muy Bueno.  

I'm not a big hot dog fan, but when the mood strikes, this is the only place for me.  They have a good selection of dogs and wraps (you can get chicken too) and salads.  But my favorite thing about this place is the Blue shake.  I find myself going there just for that.

It can be a little pricey, $7-8 for lunch, but all in all, its a great place for tasty treats with a laid-back atmosphere.  

It used to be called Hot Dogma then the legals made them change it because apparently someone else was just as witty but five minutes earlier than these guys."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. They have overpriced hot dogs. But as hot dogs go they were pretty good and with friendly service."}
{"text":"Frankly, I've been a fervid fan of Franktuary franks for like forever! For real. The downtown location is one of my fave lunch spots to grab and go on a busy lunch hour. Even better is sitting comfortably with a cocktail or a beer late in the evening relaxing with friends. No, not downtown, but at the NEW location in Lawrenceville. 

Same great hot dogs - regular Boar's Head, locavore, fish frank for Lent, a veggie dog and some other quite nice dog selections - as the original downtown site. Besides that, check out the outstanding garbanzo fries, poutine, salads and even desserts! Yes, the menu is bigger and better than downtown. Bigger space + bigger kitchen = bigger selection. And the menu is gluten-free friendly! BIG kudos! 

(Just a note here. Another reviewer slammed the gluten-free bun at Franktuary. He stated, \"Unsure of which type of bun to choose, and being that I'm unmoved by whole wheat bread, I went for a gluten-free roll and found it to be as arid as those pitiful meatballs, crumbling in my hands, so much so that I ate the meat with plastic utensils and tossed the bread in the trash.\" HEADS UP! A gluten-free bun is crumbly because IT HAS NO GLUTEN! Gluten is what gives normal bread structure and substance. Don't slam Franktuary for a gluten-free bun that does what it naturally does. Thank you, Franktuary, for having GF buns and ignore the remarks of the gluten-free unenlightened.)

Then there's the bar. A hot dog joint with a BAR?! Yes. Not just any bar either. The cocktails are the creation of the lovely and talented Marie Periello of The Stir Society. If you're a fan of a dirty martini, you just may enjoy a little twist with a Holy Cow using Boyd & Blair vodka, pickle juice, beef boullion, caper berries (mmmmm...) and pepper...nicely spicy! Enjoy a refreshing sangria? The Church Wine Punch kicks it up a notch with a touch of Scotch to the mix. Delightful.

Don't think because the Lville spot is open that Franktuary has abandoned downtown. Nope. Lunch time will still find me stopping for a quick dog bite often at the original location. 

Further. For a frank on the fly, find the Franktuary Truck. You'd be fortunate!"}
{"text":"When I was in high school, I had a crush on a girl in my Calculus class. Every day she brought a freshly-clipped copy of the newspaper's crossword puzzle and would work on it while our teacher droned on about derivatives. To get noticed by her, I started bringing the crossword puzzle to class too. Soon, we started working on the puzzles together, passing the paper back and forth while writing notes to each other in the margins about our guesses for clues. Although she never developed any romantic feelings towards me, I did become extremely good at crossword puzzles. 

Up until last week, that talent had mostly just sat on the shelf of my brain, only used to occupy time on boring airplane flights. However, last Thursday my sister and her boyfriend took me to Franktuary were I was finally able to put my skills to good use on their weekly Crossword Challenge.

Every Thursday (starting at 7 pm), Franktuary issues two crossword puzzles to every table. If you finish the easy crossword in 15 minutes or less, you get 20% off of your meal. 10% for finishing in 45 minutes. If you finish the hard puzzle at all, you get 30% off. You can even work as a team. No phones allowed though!

We totally dominated the easy puzzle in 14 minutes for the 20% discount. We barely finished a quarter of the hard puzzle though. At any rate, I had a ton of fun doing the puzzle and we saved $9 on our meal. Win-win.

Although the crossword puzzling is enough to get five stars from me, the food was actually very good too. I had the Chicago Imposter hot dog and all of the ingredients were really flavorful. I especially enjoyed the sweet relish. The fries I ordered with my hot dog were great too. 

Overall, we were all pretty impressed with the food. The service was a little slow, but I like to think they were just giving us more time to work on the crossword. Next time I am in Pittsburgh, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Today I decided I needed a hot dog and some fries and I knew Franktuary would be the perfect place.  

My children always kid me about wanting a combo meal and that's exactly what I got.  The $8 meal is a good deal! You choose any frank, 1/2 order of fries and a drink! My choice: grass fed beef dog, chili, topped with sharp cheddar on a whole grain bin, 1/2 fries with garlic aioli and ketchup on the side and a ginger ale to wash it down.

The meal was great and satisfied my hot dog & fry craving!"}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood a few weeks ago and decided to try this location - it is a beautiful place, with a lot of promise! My 3 star rating is likely to change as we try the place several more times in the near future. It doesn't get a 5 star rating at this time because of one of the dogs we had, which we felt could certainly be improved on. (The japanese dog, in our opinion, could use some tweaking, since the seaweed, which sounds like such a great idea, was fairly bland and the texture just wasn't right for it to be served with a dog. )

Our waitress was new at the job, but was very friendly, and the service was excellent - fast, efficient, and courteous. The food was served at the right temperature, and was flavorful (we had the New Yorker, Athens, Texan and Negishi, plus a side of poutine and the fountain cola). The price was a little high for hot-dogs, but one can look past that for the level of quality and craft that went into setting up the place.

The bar looks inviting, and I am sure we'll be back to try out their craft in this area as well. What a great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. I am so happy I can get turkey dogs and turkey corn dogs here, done up all fancy with so many exciting and imaginative fixings. Prices are fair. Place was popping on super-fun Tuesday night trivia night. Great tap list, too! Everything everyone ordered was a hit. Things sounded great and WERE great! Only complaint/only reason not to give 5 stars was that the food service was really spotty on trivia night. Food took forever to come, and waitress failed to bring mustard for corn dog (after I asked) for a long time; eventually had to walk up and get it myself. Casual, fun environment. When I have gluten-free or vegan friends visiting, I know where they can get cool food!"}
{"text":"This place is in a church basement in downtown Pittsburgh. It's a friendly hole-in-the-wall and they offer a vegan hot dog.

I got the vegan dot with some vegan chili added to it ($3.75 total). I'm not a huge fan of hot dogs, but this turned out to be a simple, quick and cheap meal.

My only gripes: I wish the chili had been spicier and fresher (some diced green chilis and tomatoes would have helped); and I wish they had a whole wheat bun instead of white flour. Also, while the Smart Dogs they used are tasty, I think vegan sausages (such as those made by Tofurkey or Field Roast) are far more flavorful.

Oh, and if they had some vegan desserts (how about cookies? or a soy ice cream?) I would have given them an extra star."}
{"text":"Second time here, and probably will not be back. 

I was seated after several minutes of waiting, even though it was about 75% empty. The draft and bottle lists were sub par at best. Finally ordered a Troegs Perpetual IPA after my first two picks were sold out. Our waitress clearly did not know the happy hour specials either, even though I quickly located the specials on the back side of the menu.

Then it came time to order. Originally I wanted the Korean dog, but they were out of kimchi (basically the most important part). I settled with the Pittsburgh and Philly Tubesteak. Neither were anything spectacular. Although I did steal a bite of my boyfriend's Chicago Imposter which is probably the best dog on the menu.

Had high hopes based upon my first time at Franktuary but clearly the quality, in both food and service, has not been retained."}
{"text":"Veggie dog is just a vegan tofu dog. Wasn't totally impressed but their food truck is pretty cute."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Franktuary and definitely our last. The first time we went was during Open Streets in July. We decided to come here because they were open early and the place across the street was crowded. Drinks were good and the server was very polite and as helpful as the kitchen would allow him to be. The food tastes good, I had a zucchini fritter with a salad. I had asked for an egg with my meal and had to wait at least another 20 minutes for it after my meal had arrived. Another girl in our group was served a cold quiche. She was told that was the traditional way to serve it...never in our lives have any of us been served cold quiche. The waiter did rectify it without her asking. 

We went again today out of convenience hoping they would have something relatively healthy to eat. Yes I know it's hot dog place. The only thing I wanted was the summer frittata and was told they weren't ready yet. Really? I can make one at home in less than 15 minutes and that's exactly what I wish I'd done, gone home. I got the Holy trinity combo of nicely cooked scrambled eggs, limp undercooked bacon, and a barely there salad. Then had to wait another 10 minutes for toast. And coffee is $3! Our waiter was kind and I have no complaints with the service.

If a restaurant is serving brunch across the street from one of the most popular brunch spots in Lawrenceville then your game should be tight. They have to understand they'll get their overflow so do brunch right or don't do it at all! The kitchen better get their act together.

I tried this place a second time and never again."}
{"text":"Had a regular ol' hotdog and fries from these folks' truck today. It was really good! Well worth the money. The food was good and service was friendly and fast. I look forward to trying more of what they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Poutine, a corndog, and beer after work. Exactly what I wanted on a cold snowy day. Everything was good and the staff was friendly. I'll come back again."}
{"text":"Great casual spot for beer and lunch. Server was attentive. We showed up around 1:30 on a Saturday, and it was pretty empty. I had the New Yorker, and it was excellent - the casing was crispy and the toppings were perfectly proportionate. My boyfriend created his own dog and said it was great. I was a little disappointed by the poutine. The gravy had an Interesting herb-y taste. I enjoyed it, but my boyfriend didn't. I also would have liked the cheese curds to be melted little more. All in all, pretty good."}
{"text":"This is a neat looking place, both inside and outside. I was alone, and decided to stop and get a hotdog to go. I didn't really want it to go, but I also didn't want to sit at a table and be waited on.  I was in kind of a hurry.  I told the hostess, and she pointed me to the bar where I waited patiently (that's code for dang girl come take my order already) for the barmaid to acknowledge my presence. 

I placed my order and quickly enough my order was up in a brown paper bag. I ate the hotdog at a park on the Northside. The hotdog and chili were good, no complaints there.  I'd like to go back (soon I hope!) with friends and have a couple beers to go with the hotdog.

They could have included a napkin or two with my to go order."}
{"text":"I guess it's a pretty alright dog. But coming from San Francisco and being raised on Rosamunde's sausage grill, I can't say that I have the desire to ever go back to Franktuary. I can buy a package of dogs at the supermarket and put a bunch of stuff on it at home, and there I can even toast the bun."}
{"text":"Poutine is great! Try the original one with gravy, that's the best. 
Hot dogs are good as well, but if you're really hungry you need to order 2,3. 
Overall it's a good place for late night hang out since the kitchen is open till midnight."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Rate the food 3.5, not bad. Snotty order taker. I ordered the components of the special separately and she charged me the full price. After I noticed this her response was \"You should have looked.\" Not the way to inspire a return. There is another hot dog shop around the corner...next time l'll go there. I am a business owner myself and this is an example of how NOT to treat customers."}
{"text":"Look at the top of the page and you'll see the ambiance described as \"Hipster, Casual, Trendy\" This place is way too Hipster & Trendy for my tastes.

Stopped in for lunch. Hotdogs and fries were average or slightly above average at best. Gravy was awful. Ordered meatballs as appetizer and they were awesome (take it from a meatball connoisseur) but that was the only highlight."}
{"text":"Ask The bartender Chris to make you a drink- he is the real deal."}
{"text":"We found ourselves in Lawrenceville for dinner and came to find Frantuary. We went around the members of our party to see if we were all OK with what would be a hot dog/sausage dinner, and when they came to me I said \"I am in heaven.\" I relate this part of the visit because I review this restaurant as someone with sausagemaking in my heritage.

I liked Fraktuary a lot. The atmosphere was perfect for this part of Pittsburgh. The service was equally remarkable. The menu was eclectic yet varied sufficiently that all members of our group found something of interest. The food combinations that we had were well prepared and quite delicious.  There really is nothing negative to say about the meal whatsoever.

The issues that I have with this restaurant have to do with the cognitive dissonance of dining in an upscale hot dog restaurant. I just could not get past the fact that I was paying $15 for what amounts to a dog, fries and a beer. I can see bringing people here for the upscale atmosphere, but I think I would be otherwise uncomfortable treating someone to a meal as simple as a frankfurter, if it were that special of an occasion.  Therefore, if I want a stadium dog, I will find someplace more 'downscale' and if I have a special occasion, I will look for a more upscale menu."}
{"text":"I visited this shop during restaurant week because of the special they had. 2 hot dogs any style, 2 boylan sodas and a poutine to share all for $20.13. When we first walked in, the inside was spacious and well lit with seating for plenty. They had the garage style window up to let in fresh air and extra light. It was a seat your-self establishment so we had alot of tables to choose from. It was about 2pm on a friday but there were very few people inside, maybe 10-12. The seats are like church pews along with hard wood tables, thus the name franktuary.

The manager greeted us with a smile an offered us any seat we would like. We chose to sit closest to the kitchen which wasn't a bad choice because the noise level was really low. The pew/bench which is nailed to the floor sat very far from the table making it almost uncomfortable to sit. My fiance was on the other end so he offered to sit next to me so we could pull the table closer to us. Our waitress came to offer us drinks, I chose the cream soda and he chose the lemon-lime soda. They were all natural and delicious with fresh flavor. After looking over the menu we decided on the pittsburgh dog which had mushed pierogi and cole slaw on it. i went with sauerkraut instead of the slaw. my fiance chose the chicago style which is a classic dog of course. For our poutine we ordered the texas which came with beef chili, chedder cheese and jalapenos. 

The poutine was definitely my favorite over the hot dogs. My pierogi was cold and the dog i order which was their new zealand underdog was very tough and dry. the toppings made it had to swallow because their was very little moisture. I found myself drinking soda after every bite. The poutine on the other hand was very tasty and hot. The fries had become a little soggy from the chili but i enjoyed them this way. We both decided on a beer but they only had about 10 drafts to choose from. Although their was a full bar and a make-your-own cocktail menu i would have preferred more beers. 

After halfway finishing my food my now fiance had surprised me with an engagement ring and a banner reading \"will you marry me?\" I was definitely overcome with joy but sad that he had chosen a place that we had never been to before. There is a chance i may return to franktuary but just for the poutine and a drink."}
{"text":"Cool little place. Our service was great and the food was tasty. Especially liked the poutine fries."}
{"text":"If you are a coffee lover, NITRO COLD BREW IS AMAZING! A bit pricy, but worth the cup! So smooth. We just had brunch there, and it was delicious and wait staff was very friendly! 

If you order anything with eggs, be specific on what kind you want, as ours were over cooked."}
{"text":"Really cute \"sanctuary-spot\" to grab a hotdog and a nice beer! Nice variety of hotdogs with fancy toppings and perogies for a cold winter day. Nice spot for comfort food"}
{"text":"It was ok.... Over priced for some rogies, they were good but not the best I've ever had. . I'll give this place another chance tho. I really like the fact that they are open until 2 on weekends ..."}
{"text":"I have never eaten a hot dog (anywhere), but God, do I love Poutine. This is probably the best poutine in the city. I'm a traditionalist and the poutine Quebecois was everything that I could have wanted. There are also other varieties, and I sampled the poutine Buffalo, which was topped with wing-style toppings. It was quite good and just the right amount of spice.

The waitstaff was courteous, polite, & attentive. He checked with us frequently and offered enough guidance to be helpful but not to be pushy.

Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Ok, but I literally dream about the Quebecoise Poutine. It took me forever to finally try Franktuary, but I went at the best time (11am, just after opening) for a lunch date with my darling. I order a simple tofu dog with vegan chili and cheddar, and we share a poutine. 

Everything about my meals here has been on point, and presentation is lovely too. I mean, I can't resist a classic chili dog (vegetarian style) with excellent presentation. I'm not a huge fan of the messy slop that loaded dogs often become, but I haven't seen a single dog from here come out looking unpresentable. They go the extra step to make the food look as delicious as it tastes, and sorry not sorry, but looks are everything when it comes to me and food. 

Extra points are given for all of the locally sourced foods and beers. Pittsburgh and PA in general has some wonderful options for local dairy, beer, etc, so it's great to see a restaurant utilizing those resources to bring us the best ingredients. 

I suspect Franktuary will be a fave for a long time to come. Staff is friendly. The space is big enough so that I don't feel crowded out. The food is quick and tasty and relatively affordable. It's a winner all around, so what's not to like?"}
{"text":"It was my first time in Pittsburgh and I'm glad I chose to check out Franktuary. I have been a Vegetarian for years and my biggest \"meat\" craving is hot dogs. Whenever I find a place that offers Veggie Dogs I can't resist stopping by. I was flying solo in town on business so I was glad to see that Franktuary had a bar that I could sit at (I'm not used to dining alone so bar seating was a plus!). I ordered a Mangorita which was delicious and strong, just the way I like it. I also had the Street Corn Salad, it had good flavor and texture with the cheese, fried tortilla chips, and pickled jalapeños. My only criticism is that the corn wasn't grilled. My server recommended the Chicago Imposter style hot dog which was fantastic. They also had Bingo going on at the tables and bar and everyone playing was having a good time. Nice atmosphere, good service, great food, fair prices, clean bathrooms, nice bar, draft beer selection, family friendly, I would definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I love drinking here.  I love drinking here even more, now that the weather is turning warm and they've opened their big front windows.  The environment is fantastic... there are tons of bar seats, including some prime spots that look straight out the windows and into the street, and the cocktails are really well done -- in fact, I think Franktuary serves up the second best cocktails in mid/lower Lawrenceville, second only to Tender.  For the bar of a hot dog joint, that's impressive!!  My favorite one for a sunny day is the doubting Tom Collins... so refreshing and balanced.  The lime in this makes it better than regular Tom Collinses!

Looking for a great bang for your buck?  Get the church wine punch.  Port, lemon, scotch, honey, and cloves?  Talk about throwing a bunch of my favorite things in a punch bowl!  And, yes, it is as tasty as it sounds.

The food is kind of hit-or-miss here.  I love the grass-fed beef meatballs, though they are definitely on the pricey side (just have them during happy hour -- the meatballs are discounted to $2 each!).  But what do you expect... they are grass-fed, and organic!  The beef hot dogs are also very tasty, but I was much less impressed by the salmon and vegan ones.  Perhaps people who don't actually eat meat, or beef, would find them more palatable, but I will never be ordering those again!  I also think the garbanzo fries, while a cool concept, are a bit bland.  They come with sauces, but they are thick and have a thick, complex texture, so the sauces only go so far in flavoring.

The service, though, is outstanding!  All the bartenders here are great, but I was particularly impressed by Roger, who put up with a lot of nonsense from my friends and me one night when Franktuary was our last stop and we'd had a lot to drink already.  He was super accommodating and nice to us and even gifted me a lemon because I was out of them and wanted to make bloody marys the next morning. The staff are all super nice to my dog when I bring her and she hangs out on the sidewalk outside the open garage-door window.  They bring her water and pet her.  Obviously Franktuary has a great team of staff, and in large part because of that, this continues to be my lower lawrenceville go-to spot for an anytime drink."}
{"text":"Three words: Full. Contact. Trivia.  So much fun, way better than normal, boring bar trivia.  We've only gone a couple of times (Tuesdays at 8pm), but have really enjoyed it.  They also recently started a Crossword night on Thursdays, but the time we went it was totally dead, and honestly we can do crosswords at home and not spend so much money.  This place has pretty good food, including veggie-friendly items on their menu, and also generally good rotating taps and excellent mixology.  The major downside is the prices.  An evening out for two of us, even if we don't eat anything and just have a couple rounds of drinks, can run to $50 including tip.  This is a bit much for our budget, and even though the drinks are good I don't think they warrant the excessive price tag.  So for us, Franktuary remains an only occasional place."}
{"text":"Drinks=great. Poutine=great. Hotdogs=ok. Service=Good, but with one problem.

My friends and I went to Franktuary on a Saturday night. There were 7 of us. We expected a wait, and we expected it to be busy. When we got there, we were given a quote for 20-30 min. My friends gave his cell phone, and he received a text that the wait would be 35 min. So we decided to go across the street for a drink. As soon as we ordered our drinks, we got a text that our table was ready (5 minutes had gone by). That's wonderful...getting a table early is awesome. We called Franktuary to tell them we had just gotten drinks and would be over as long as they could hold the table. They said they would hold it for ten minutes. So we all paid, some of us leaving behind half empty drinks. When we got back, they had already given away our table. We made it within the ten minutes they said they would hold it for.

Aside from that, the service was good. The waitress was quick, attentive, and kind.

The hotdogs were good, but they were not as mind-blowing as I was expecting. I prefer Station Street Hotdogs for my gourmet hotdog eating. I ordered the Reykjavik. I had high expectations, as I've had a hotdog from Reykjavik before. Iceland wins. That's ok, though, because I was exciting to see such an option and think it was really cool!

Overall, good experience with a tiny hiccup. I may be back for the poutine. But I'll go to Station Street for hotdogs."}
{"text":"I don't get the 5 star reviews?!?

I finally went to Franktuary during lunch and had such high hopes considering the reviews it gets.  The place is in a little nook inside a church which is cool and all.  They have Boylans sodas which is hip.  They do all kinds of favors to Vegans and localvores, again neat.  What got me was they that serve the dogs on subpar buns....
That being said I got 2 dogs.  The Detroit and the Chicago.
The Detroit was good, chili, mustard, onions with a good dog.  I was surprised by the lack of snap though and the chili seemed like a haphazard throw together.  Basically just beans.....I've had better.
The Chicago was an impostor.  Poppy seeds in place of celery seed and banana peppers in place of sport peppers.....

I really am not sure what the hype is....I'll go back and see what some other dogs do for me I guess."}
{"text":"I've gone to franktuary twice now, and had a great experience both times. They have a large selection of \"dogs\" ranging from regular through a vegan dog. Once you select your base, you then select your \"style\" to indicate the toppings you would like. They have a large selection of poutine options as well, which I've tried both times. The customer service is always phenomenal, and the prices are fair. The only reason for 4 vs. 5 stars is the flavors don't knock your socks off. Yummy, good value, great customer service, unique, great atmosphere! Overall, a wonderful choice!!"}
{"text":"Don't live in PA anymore, so this was my FIRST trip to Franktuary. Had the PA Dutch Underdog and Buffalo Underdog. Both were great. The combos are interesting and have contextual significance (i.e. PA Dutch), which makes the menu well thought-out. Add in a Straub pint and it was a nice lunch.

Service was pleasant and timely."}
{"text":"Being Vegan can suck - a lot - especially when you eat pretty strictly following a bodybuilding diet. 

I have been here a few times now for a nosh. 1st time with a tour group, 2nd time with my husband (pre contest) on a Friday night and most recently this past Sunday for brunch...but I didn't know about this brunch phenomenon where the menu's are killed down in PGH....sorry, I'm Canadian. 

SO. It took us several attempts at trying to piece together something to eat as I was in starvation mode and could not leave without food. The waiter was SUPER helpful and sweet and great but damnit, the menu is NOT good for vegans for brunch, period. 

I know there are veggie franks but paying $8 USD for a Field Roast hot dog on a dry bun is kind of a punch in the junk considering a 5 pack of them is less than $8 at retailers. 

I guess they are generally more expensive to produce but, woah, hello margin!

Also, the veggie \"bacon\" should take a hike. Its plain pan fried tofu with nothing added and was probably the most frustrating part of the whole experience. The accompanying salad was about 2/3 of a cup in size and felt bad for me as I ate it. 

I dunno. I'm not sure if it's just me or this place but for the cost and limited menu (for vegans) I don't think I\"ll be back. Unless I have an extreme pig out night in the future where I can eat junk food to my hearts content and don't mind paying 3 times more than it's worth for the privelidge."}
{"text":"I was insulted yesterday afternoon. 

I wanted to see how Franktuary Lawrenceville handled meatballs. 

Judging by their desiccant composition, I can only hypothesize that someone omitted the egg and bread crumbs. 

Unsure of which type of bun to choose, and being that I'm unmoved by whole wheat bread, I went for a gluten-free roll and found it to be as arid as those pitiful meatballs, crumbling in my hands, so much so that I ate the meat with plastic utensils and tossed the bread in the trash. 

Customizing my sorry sandwich further, I opted to have it topped with marinara and cheese curds. The marinara, which drowned the meatballs, almost made it worthwhile with its tanginess, but the cheese curds were evocative of flavorless chewing gum wads. 

However, the pierogi trio I ordered were deep fried dumplings of oily, starchy adoration. Resembling crisped wontons stuffed with the manner of fluffy mashed potatoes that come from heaven, I was sad that I didn't order a sextet and eschew the moribund meatball sandwich. 

Something that also truly chafes me about this Lawrenceville Franktuary is the idea of bohemians eating ridiculously expensive hot dogs with their smallest digits unfurled, and were they ever packing the joint when I visited for what will be the last time. About 5 neo-beatniks in \"vintage\" garb who are probably living off of trust funds and who were dying to people-watch and be watched themselves were disappointed by my presence, turning their heads to see WHO was walking in only to find me, a reg'lar old prole. They frowned and went back to their conversation. The service this trip was equally unenthusiastic. The bartender who took my order was more interested in chatting up other customers (namely flirting with older, upper-crust married men in suits and ties) to make even the slightest conversation with me. 

Moreover, for nearly $19 dollars (including a $3 bottle of Boylan soda), I feel I should have enjoyed what I ate much more than I did, particularly when the organic, local-first ingredients are taken into account.

If Franktuary wants to \"redeem fast food,\" to paraphrase their motto, their pompous work is in vain. What they are doing is spitting in their patron's faces, and what's tragic is that their haughty clientele doesn't get it. Thankfully, the other side of Lawrenceville does. 

Walk a few blocks down Butler Street, and you'll find a humble establishment in a humble building called Frankie's that makes moist, rich, and overall larger and superior meatballs with free fixings, not to mention kielbasa, hot sausage, and foot-long franks. If you're lunching alone, you won't spend more than $10, and if you are a genuine aficionado of good food and not aesthetic and trends, you'll relish it. 

The Franktuary of Lawrenceville is not the Franktuary of Downtown Pittsburgh that shined a light onto my day a couple of years ago.

P.S. Take a look at the Franktuary website and notice that each location has its own distinct logo. The Downtown shoppe's logo is whimsical while the Lawrenceville location is stark and self-serious. Gimme some sanctuary from Franktuary...

{"text":"I had two hot dogs for breakfast today! 

 Luckily, I had to bus it  to work this morning, which gave me an excuse to swing by Eide's Entertainment and of course, Franktuary. 

I never thought I'd ever walk into a church and ask someone, \"Hey man, where's the hot dog place?\"

It's a little hard to find, but once you wind your way around and downstairs to the basement to get there, you'll find that your quest had been a worthy one.

So obviously, it's a hot dog joint, but it feels more like a smoothie shop or a cafe. As I told the three folks (two gals and a guy, sounds like a sit-com) who run the restaurant, \"Man, you don't get dogs like these at Uni-Mart.\"

I went gourmet X 2 being a workin' man bon viviant (huge appetite, a taste for good food) and got the Southern Belle and The Chicago Imposter. 

I love chili and coleslaw but never had them together before, let alone on a Fenway-style bun (for years I thought I was the only person who used a piece of bread to shroud a frank in a pinch) o'er top a snappin', poppin' natural-casing dog. The colorful, tangy, crisp slaw made for one beautiful, luscious mess. Their chili also follows a golden rule when it comes to chili dogs: NEVER dress your dog with a chili you wouldn't eat in a bowl. As one of the young women told me, \"This isn't date food.\" Thankfully I'm kinda stag now. 

The Chicago Imposter also goes Fenway with the bun but adds all the classic Chi-Town toppings: relish, mustard, a pickle spear ( I thought for years that I came up with this on my own also), onions, banana peppers, celery salt, and the neatest little micro-tomatoes I've ever seen, cut exquisitely in half and acting as an awesome garnish. 

Wouldja believe that this was my very first Chicago-style dog? 

These pups are well-crafted, folks. Use napkins though. Lots. 

To wash it down I got a regular sized Fruit Shake, a.k.a Smoothie, and it was sublime. They were awaiting an ice cream shipment (I stopped in at 10am, which is when they open) so they got ingenious and made do by giving me a strawberry shake with lemon sorbet. What a perfect breakfast drink. I could have one every morning. 

 It was really nice to find such a place in the heart of busy Downtown, let alone on a chilly, blustery morn.  This is a special establishment operated by some really cool, friendly, laid-back, socially conscious people. Eating here made my day. Stop in sometime, and I'm sure it'll make yours too."}
{"text":"Franctuary.  I'm over it.  Came to the Lawrenceville location Sunday afternoon for a hot dog and fries.  It's Franctuary.  I wanted a hot dog.  Simple.  I had to explain why I didn't want brunch??  Frankie's is just across the street, I'll go there."}
{"text":"Nice big fat dog with some interesting selections.  Ordered a \"Signature Frank\" - BLT which was very good, with bacon, mixed greens, tomato and chipotle ranch.  The \"Frank \" was very good and enjoyed the toppings.  The menu also has a few salads, a few poutines and other sides.  We shared a Quebecoise Poutine that was OK, the fries were good but the gravy was a little cold and just not as good as I was expecting.

We did not have any beer, but there were a list of 9 beers on tap."}
{"text":"If you like good dogs, this is the place.  The have gourmet dogs in natural casing on Boston style buns.   Have a Pittsburgh dog, Buffalo, New York and a few others.  The Chicago Imposter is very good with banana pepper, celery salt, pickle spear and small tomato slices.  Have salads and fruit shakes."}
{"text":"WHO LET THESE DOGS OUT?  (PUT THEM BACK IN!)

Stopped into a church I passed along the way...well, i got down on my knees and i began to pray....FOR BETTER HOT DOGS!

Do yourself a favor.  Save a few smackers (dollars) and treat yourself to a cheeseburger dog at the 7-11 down the street! (Yum!)

Maybe if the goths who run the counter paid more attention to cooking and less to their CRAZY HAIR AND TATTOOS, I might not want to barf!

Just kidding, they don't have a PRAYER of improving!

I confess, THIS PLACE SUX!!  *church joke ; )"}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner w 4 adults 2 kids and a baby. Very kid friendly !!! Kid meal is $5 and they loved it. I had Pittsburg frank delicious grass fed beef frank w pierogies and vinegar slaw. Chicago frank was loaded and delicious. Holiday road frank shaved turkey cranberry sauce gravy yum. PA Dutch apple onion jam cheddar cheese and scallions. Pouting cheese could have been melted. Large selection of beers. Happy hour was supposed to include local spirit drinks but waitress seemed to be at a loss as to what it was. All in all I WILL come back. VegN available"}
{"text":"Wife and I went to the Franktuary the other night for dinner.
My wife had been talking about the Franktuary for weeks and what great reviews it got.
The staff were very friendly and helpful and had great attitudes.
I had 2 regular dogs with yellow mustard only and an order of fries.
The fries were ok but a bit too salty for my taste.
The dogs were ok would not say they were anything that special.
If I was in the area and really in the mood for a hot dog I would probably go again.
I found the prices too be reasonable and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I like Franktuary it's in a decent location and I seem to end up there on my bicycle quite often. Their hotdogs are interesting but a little bit let down by the dog itself.  Full disclosure, I grew up on and still love hotdogs at the Original. Do what you like with that information.

They usually have a decent tap list and some interesting sodas if you're into that.  When the windows are open out to the street it has a nice airy feel to it. I've had mixed results with the service there. Some bartenders really good, others not so much.  If you're walking were shopping in Lawrenceville and want a quick snack, this is about the only place in that section of the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Good food and cool interior.

Boyfriend and I shared the baked potato poutine and the chili (with bacon added). Poutine was great. It had bacon, cheese, sour cream, and jalapeño. Wasn't too ecstatic about the cheese, which looked a little dried up, but I loved the combination of fries, sour cream, and jalapeño. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! We weren't a fan of the chili. No reason really other than it tasted really average. 

My choice of hot dog was the Omaha (sauerkraut, swiss cheese, thousand island). Boyfriend got the Oahu (bacon, pineapple, teriyaki, scallions) and the Koreatown (Korean BBQ, cheese, kimchi, cilantro). They were interesting! We both enjoyed our hot dogs and thought they were priced fairly reasonably too. 

More positives about our experience:
- Our server, Delaney, was super sweet. 
- The restaurant plays great music.
- Half off wine on Wednesdays after 6pm!

They have other special deals depending on the day, so definitely give Franktuary a try if you haven't already.

{"text":"I've only been here for brunch, so I can't speak for the hot dogs. It looked pretty busy but our table of 6 was seated quickly. We had several vegetarians in the group and the pickings were pretty good for those with dietary restrictions. I got the chicken and waffle, which was pretty good but the portion size was HUGE. 

Actually, I was pretty confused by all the portions sizes because everyone else's portions seemed quite small and then my portion was monstrous -- I ended up only eating ~1/3 of it and giving some of it away to my hungry friends who didn't order such a large entree and were still hungry, and I STILL had leftovers for the next day. 

Regarding the food itself -- it was actually a \"Mexican\" themed chicken and waffle, which came with a cornbread waffle and mole sauce. I found the waffle to feel... gritty? I'm not sure if it was the cornmeal they used but I've made cornmeal waffles before without such a pronounced graininess. My favorite part was the chicken, which was really crispy and not greasy at all. It was a little soggy the next day, but that was to be expected. 

Overall, pretty good experience, though I don't think I'd come back unless invited -- I wouldn't want to get an entree and leave hungry!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a casual lunch on my first day in Pittsburgh and ordered the Polish dog. Staff was very friendly and accommodating and even gave me their wifi password when I mentioned I needed to do some work! Would definitely visit again! :-)"}
{"text":"First food stop in Pittsburgh. I'm a big hot dog fan and I love that this place has gluten free buns and lots of different options for the dog: turkey, beef, veggie. I got a Chicago-style dog that ended up being pretty messy--too much mustard. They have lots of speciality toppings that looked great, but the flavors were just okay. Our food came out sort of room temperature. My side of fries was soggy. Great concept but the execution was just okay."}
{"text":"Back again June 2018. This time sat on the barstool facing the open air section facing the street. Great for summer people watching. I had the Texan dog which was chili, cheddar & jalapeños. I also had a small poutine québécois which was gravy, cheese curds & shallots. Could have used more shallots. Happy hour was over so I went with Great Divide Heydey IPA. Beer was cold & fresh. I think this place is a tad pricey for hotdogs since they aren't foot longs nor are they giant & fat dogs. Just basic. Nothing wrong with them, it's just that $30 with tip for a hot dog, poutine & 2 beers is a lot IMHO. Maybe I'm old!"}
{"text":"Hipster bar. Great Moscow Mule. Solid standard poutine and farmers cheese pierogis. It would be nice if their menu had more variety; all they serve is what I mentioned and hot dogs, which look good, but I wasn't in the mood for a dawg. It was kinda dead in there. Waitress was nice. Prices are kinda high. Eh."}
{"text":"Great for a quick meal before or after some drinking.  I actually had my parents bring me here for my birthday dinner before we went on my birthday bar crawl.  It was a cheap way to get the whole family dinner in a relaxed atmosphere and have some fun.  I love the vlademere poutine and the new yorker hot dog.  However, my only complaint is that every time I have been here, they are out of the locovore hotdog.  Take it off the menu if you don't offer it."}
{"text":"Delicious hot dogs and poutine.  Great way to grab a quick bite before a night of drinking, or to round out a night of drinking!  Love the local offerings."}
{"text":"I love bad puns.  After a childhood of cringing and burying my head in my hands at least once daily while conversing with my father, I grew to accept that \"clever\" wordplay is my birthright.  Without further ado, allow me to announce the candidates for Best Worst Pun in a Business Name.

First up: Eye Carumba, an optometrist in San Francisco.  Next we have Blow, a hair salon in Berkeley.  Following that, the Franktuary, a hot dog restaurant in a church in Pittsburgh.  Next up is Get the Funk Out, a laundromat in San Francisco.  Last but not least, the Great Impasta, an Italian restaurant in Champaign, IL.

And the winner is... the Franktuary!  Yeah! The Franktuary takes the prize in this epic cross-country competition, via the killer combo of name and general all-around fabulosity. 

Sadly, I have visited this establishment just once.  Lest you think the contest was rigged or something, I assure you that I would be there 24/7, if not for a tiny detail: I live in San Francisco. Boo San Francisco! 

Why the trek, you ask? Are the hot dogs really that good? To make a long story short, I played tagalong awhile back to a gentleman friend who was in Pittsburgh for an interview. As I was trying to work remotely, I was left either stuck in a stuffy hotel room or venturing out in search of free wireless.  Since my attention span approximates that of a goldfish, I opted for the latter, assuming I might have a stroke of luck and find a cute café nearby. However, when Yelp suggested a business that had 1) an excellent pun involving hot dogs and sacred space 2) a vegetarian friendly menu, and 3) free wireless, I was pretty much floored.  

I'd recommend the Franktuary on all fronts.  I don't know if I'd have the scrambled egg and cheese covered hot dog breakfast, and definitely not the \"Hypocrite\" (veggie dog smothered in non-veggie chili).  However, I find the former ballsy, the latter hilarious, and the rest of it just plain awesome."}
{"text":"I have loved Franktuary since they were downtown in the basement of a church and called hot dogma. They advertised on my campus radio station and I still think of that jingle sometimes, randomly! 

I had brunch today with my family, and of course, loved it. I had the hot dog special and my husband had the farmers poutine. Both were incredible! 

Also, the place is great for kids. Our 16-month old son was given a coloring page and crayons and all of the servers told us how sweet he was. I always appreciate when we don't feel out of place at a restaurant when we bring him."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Franktuary since they were called Hot Dogma. As a young college kid I heard their catchy jingle on Point Park's college radio station and walked over to the basement of the church in Downtown Pittsburgh where they had their first set up. I always always got the Polamalu dog! I have fond memories of doing my homework there and bringing my friends to try it out for the first time, feeling like I knew about this secret cool spot. 

So of course I loved when they opened the Lawrenceville spot but I got even more excited when I learned they'd be returning to Downtown! I have gone twice on my lunch break from work. It is way hipper than the basement, with a bar and communal tables. It's small, cozy and perfect for a lunch alone or even a date. 

I love the Pittsburgh dog with little pierogis and coleslaw. And every time at either location I have to order the poutine. My favorite is the baked potato kind. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu and for the price these fancy hot dogs are worth it!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, boring food. Extremely expensive cocktails. Not worth the trip."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and enjoyed our meals. I thought the S&P fries and baked beans were very flavorful and certainly fresh. The flavors of my hubby's buffalo dog and my polynesian one were spot on but the franks were average. I like that Franktuary has options for everyone; however, I'd go to D's Six Pax & Dogz over Franktuary any time."}
{"text":"I love this place, great place to go if you love hot dogs!  The service was good, the waitress was really nice.   I love how they have big garage door like windows that open up when its warm out."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try this place for a while after seeing the food truck around Oakland. The restaurant itself had a very warm and cute vibe going with all the christmas decorations. I ordered the Dusseldorf dog and my friends and I split a large Quebecoise poutine. 

My hot dog was pretty good. The grilled onions, horsey sauce, cranberry honey mustard, and bacon made a tasty but not too overpowering combination of toppings. My friend ordered the turkey dog oahu style and my friend ordered the tofu dog bangkok style. Both of their dogs were even smaller than mine which was pretty disappointing. The tofu dog had a weird consistency and no flavor. 

I was exctited to try the poutine but the gravy was very thick. The fries weren't too bad but we probably wasted half the large because it was so big and none of us really enjoyed it. Overall, I would come back for their hot dogs but maybe get two of them since they really are not that big."}
{"text":"Tried Franktuary for the first time and I couldn't believe I haven't been to this spot yet! Such a yummy and casual place to eat in Lawrenceville. I had the Chicago style turkey dog and Buffalo fries. Both were excellent! Happy hour 5-7 Tuesday through Saturday, nice to get a couple bucks off your beer. Service was great, love the atmosphere. A few parking spots in the back making it convenient to park, because Lawrenceville can sometimes be a nightmare. 

Really need to go back because there are so many other styles I want to try on turkey dogs!"}
{"text":"The tofu dog is alright - nothing amazing.  The toppings, however, make ALL the difference.  Great place for vegans.  Also tried the veggie sausage of the day which happened to be Chipotle.  It was spicy but soooooo good.  The gf is all set to come back here regularly.  

If you're a vegan and miss that chicken nugget taste/texture then I would recommend  ordering the garbanzo fries.  They were tasty and perfectly fried.  Also, way better for you than traditional french fries.

The veggie chili was a hit with me.  I would order that again.  They also have a vegan lemon dessert but we were too full to try it.  Next time, tho.  It's also nice that they have a full bar and are open til 2am on weekends!"}
{"text":"There, I finally ate poutine, finally, tried it after months and months of bickering I was finally able to try it, but I wasn't as impressed as I should have been. Granted I have no other poutine to compare this to, it was a bit underwhelming. Maybe, I expected wrong, but I expected it to be cheesier and i expected the fries to be a little better, but don't get me wrong, I am glad I was able to try poutine, I will definitely have to try poutine every chance I get.

As for the hotdog - I got the Bollywood style (hello, I had to!) - but then again, maybe that wasn't the best choice. I got the \"under-dog\" version - I couldn't tell too much of a difference though.

Beer selection is decent and the people are welcoming. We did try the poutine \"dessert\" as well, and it was OK. I want to go back and try a different style for the hotdog and give the poutine another try (not dissing on the vegan gravy - we had vegetarians among us so it was good that that was vegan - but maybe I expected the gravy to be a bit meatier in taste)

Then again, I am not the best judge for poutine. I still loved the place, and I will try to go back soon to try another style of hotdog."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday. Heard mostly good things and overall I thought it was okay. Was my skirt blown up? No. Would I come back? Yes! I got a standard frank Buffalo style with blue cheese dressing, wing sauce, and celery. I felt the dressing and sauce were a bit heavy handed and I really couldn't get a feel for the dog. I think next time I'll keep it simple with a standard frank, or local sausage with mustard and Heinz. 

Shared the baked potato poutine with my lunch mate and easily could have eaten it all up on my own. Granted, I was 8 months pregnant at the time of our visit so my appetite has been off the charts as of late. However, even if I wasn't prego one dog would certainly not be enough for a meal. A great snack--yes, but for lunch, and especially dinner, two dogs or a dog and one's own poutine serving, or side of something is in order. 

Would definitely like to try this place again and get my libations game on once after this baby arrives."}
{"text":"Franktuary is my jam! I've mostly stopped in on random weekdays for some dogs and fries...and drinks, of course. I'm a huge hot dog connoisseur. From $2 picnic dogs, to street dogs, to fancy-pants dogs ... love them all. Franktuary has great dogs a lot of fun specialty topping combos -or- you can just go classic. For the great quality of ingredients (and location), their prices are super fair.   

I've been there twice for brunch now and also had great meals paired with great service. I most recently stopped in on a Sunday afternoon (absolutely zero wait) around 1pm. Despite being towards the end of a brunch shift (not an easy shift - I'm sure anyone who works service industry understands the nightmare disguised as \"brunch\") and the staff members were all still super pleasant. They had a really cool Olympics theme going on with the menu. Super fun touch I think. My partner and I split the USA and Israel specials (bacon/egg sandwich on a bloody mary and falafel dish, respectively). Both were awesome. The shining star of brunch was our server, Delaney. She truly made the meal enjoyable, relaxed, and didn't hesitate to share a laugh with us and put up with our indecisiveness."}
{"text":"Franktuary is one of my two favorite places for dogs and veggie dogs in Pittsburgh. I love that Franktuary is creative with their \"toppings\". The veggie dog I ordered was topped with a peanut sauce and purple cabbage (Thai style). It was delicious, fresh and that topping combo was vegan, which is always a plus. The fries were crispy and hot, and they had a vegan garlic aioli that perfectly complimented the fries."}
{"text":"I went here for my friend's birthday dinner and didn't really know what to expect from a classy hot dog joint. It was perfect for her because she's a vegetarian and they have all sorts of vegetarian options, but I was underwhelmed by the options given the prices. I ended up having some of the poutine (didn't even come close to the ones I've had in Montreal), the chickpea fries (which a lot of people say had the texture of chicken... definitely did not), and a salad with a sausage. The salad was measly and the sausage was good, but nothing special. My friends ordered actual hot dogs, which looked good and they enjoyed, but the prices were a bid high for what they were getting!

The cocktails were good and the beer selection was quite nice, so I'd say this may be a better place for a nighttime drink and munchies rather than dinner. The service was neither good nor bad."}
{"text":"I did not know what to expect when we entered the joint.  A friend casually mentioned it when I told her we were going to spend a Saturday afternoon in the area.  It was a very neat atmosphere, good and friendly service and we all enjoyed the food!  We were pleased and would certainly go back.  Shout out to Mike our server!  :-)"}
{"text":"Fast, delicious, and located right near several bus stops/Gold's Gym. It's a great place if you want to eat something small while you're at work, at a bus stop, or winding down at the gym."}
{"text":"I went into this restaurant along with my brother and mother . We walked in around 3PM and ordered the Oahu, Reykjavik, the Pittsburgh, and two orders of sweet potato fries. The restaurant was decently packed and has a garage door which helps create a comfortable and pleasant vibe. I read the yelp reviews before entering, so I had pretty high expectations. Sadly, I was presented with an 'eh' meal.  I saw our entrees lying on the counter for about 10 minutes and our waiter was nowhere to be seen. After waiting for about 30 minutes, our meals were finally brought to our table. Honestly, the hot dogs were decent, but did not reach my expectations. They tasted alright, but were not exceptional. They were small as well, so I left the restaurant feeling hungry and unsatisfied. 

The atmosphere was wonderful, but we waited for 30 minutes for food that I was very unimpressed with. Thus, I give this restaurant a rating of 3 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have been to Franktuary a number of times and have had good experiences.

I have been to the bar once or twice while waiting for a table at Piccolo Forno, and the various specialty cocktails I have tried have all been delicious and high-quality. They also have decent beer choices available at all times.

The food is also great. I have tried two of the dogs: the buffalo (wing sauce, celery, and bleu cheese) and the Memphis (potato sticks, barbecue sauce, and slaw). Both were good, and I've gotten the buffalo on several subsequent visits. I am also a fan of the fries for which various dipping sauces are available. A friend of mine ordered the poutine (and I of course stole some) and it was also delicious.

The restaurant itself is very open, and it's especially nice when the garage doors are opened up to let in the breeze. This is a great place to relax with a drink and some delicious food!"}
{"text":"On a day trip to. Pittsburgh, we went to Franktuary for lunch. The table shared an order of poutine quebecquios and cheese pierogi. They were fantastic - the first vegetarian poutine I've had since my last visit to Portland, OR. Two friends got various hot dogs and were pleased, another got the grass fed beef meatball sandwhich, and I got the \"beet balls\" (a mix of. Root veggies, grains, and other veggies) meatball sandwhich, which was delcious.

We had great service, great food, and a good time."}
{"text":"What a treat! Tried the vegetarian chili and veggie corn dog, onion rings, reg dog, and fries. Delicious food. Clean, lovely atmosphere. The whole family enjoyed it. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Specialty hot dogs and things aren't really up there on my list of must-haves, but I agreed to watch a playoff hockey game here with friends last night. I had the kielbasa which was very good and made it my own with cheese, mustard, and onions. I also had one of the local brews on tap which was lightly peach tasting and refreshing. It was from Atlanta, but I don't remember the brewery or the name. But I think the best thing this place offers is the old fashioned they make. Wowww, it is gooood. They use orange bitters which I think makes it extremely tasty. Overall a decent menu and good drinks! The interior of this place was freezing. If you're an old lady like me and get cold easily, bring a sweater!"}
{"text":"As soon as I heard about Franktuary, I knew that it would be right up my alley since I love hot dogs. A trendy restaurant centered around this concept - what could be better?!

Franktuary has this hip vibe that is actually quite unique; a lot of the touches seem to have a gothic feel. I like that they really created their own distinctive atmosphere with their décor. I've been to Franktuary a couple times now, both for dinner and brunch. Most recently I came to the \"Souper Bowl Sunday\" brunch at Franktuary, which was seriously awesome! 

I have to say that I actually think I like the brunch menu at Franktuary better than the dinner menu. A lot of the dinner franks are just a little too heavy for me since they're loaded with all different types of toppings and sauces; whenever I come for dinner I always end up asking for something on the side rather than on my dog. The brunch menu seems to be a little more toned down while still extremely unique and interesting! At my recent brunch, I ordered the \"Good Morning, Frank\" which is an all-beef frank topped with cheddar cheese and a fried egg. I absolutely loved it! The scallions on top added a nice touch, and the flavors were perfect together. I have never had an egg on a hot dog before, but man was it tasty. I also would like to mention that Franktuary has fantastic French fries - many restaurants just plop some floppy fries on the side of a plate for good measure, but Franktuary's fries are the perfect blend of crispy and soft. So good! I had a glass of Pittsburgh Nitro coffee with my brunch which seems like it would have been a strange mixture with a hot dog, but it was actually a perfect complement to my meal! Pittsburgh Nitro has the best nitro coffee around.

I do recommend checking out Franktuary if you have not been yet; the atmosphere and concept are cool, and the franks are quite delicious! Hopefully I will get a chance to try out the Market Square location sometime!"}
{"text":"If Franktuary was 25% cheaper, I'd eat here weekly.  I just can't justify paying $$15 for 3 hot dogs + drink downtown.   Case in point...they sold something like 1500 Groupons, so people clearly like it....but IMO they'd be a hell of a lot busier if they were more affordable.  

The hot dogs are really good...but they're still hot dogs.  Working downtown allows me to eat really well for less than $10, even at some sit down places.  When I come here I end up going somewhere else to feel full, or I spend $15 and question myself why (just because I can afford \"gourmet\" hot dogs, the cheap college kid in me has trouble justifying it; I mean really, 7-11 has 2 hot dogs with FREE chili and cheese greatness for under $3...)

Franktuary ,I want to love you, but I'm economically opposed."}
{"text":"Great spot for vegans/vegetarians! I dragged my non-vegetarian boyfriend along and he wasn't too thrilled about paying $4 for a hot dog he can easily get elsewhere for $1. I opted for a naked vegan frank and loaded on all the free toppings they offered (still paying off those student loans). Delicious! BUT you need to try the beetball sandwich. I came for the dogs but I stayed for the beets. The beetballs are perfectly cooked and seasoned. There are plenty other unique menu items that I'll have to come back and try!"}
{"text":"I've given it several tries now and honestly, it's just not even close to worth it.

The prices are laughable for what you get when you take into consideration the quality. The poutine is fairly dour, compare it to the offering at Park Brugges (a pricier place but the same price for poutine) and you'll see what I mean. The gravy is all salt no flavor, the fries are so so, and the cheese curds never taste particularly fresh. 

The standard buns and dogs (which you'll get if you don't want to spend seven dollars per hotdog) are nothing to write home about, but they're fine. Last time I went the buns were stale but that was a one time thing from what I could tell. The choices for variety of toppings are plentiful, but most of them just run together. 

The side of fries is about the size of a medium fry from Wendy's, so don't expect to be able to share it.  Oh I'm sorry, frittes. 

The beer selection is okay but way overpriced, it's lazy to just slap a six dollar price point on all your beer that isn't Straub (still over three dollars, come on man), they should range from 4-7 or so. Haven't bothered with the ten dollar cocktails (sorry, \"libations\" see: http://www.theonion.com/articles/dude-with-knit-hat-at-party-calls-beer-libations,32433/ )

The service is good though. Last time I went my wife's veggie dogs were ice cold and the server was rather penitent about it, and clearly seemed pissed at the kitchen staff. It was busy and took fifteen minutes to get them redone, I'm not quite sure what kitchen doesn't prioritize re-fires, that's been SOP in every restaurant I've worked in. Ordered poutine and the kitchen just never made it, which was nice of them. But again the servers are really nice and make up for the bad eggs in the kitchen. 

For the price you are much better off going somewhere else. The portions and quality are just subpar. I've enjoyed the downtown location but the Lawrenceville one just seems like a scam to fleece hipsters of their parents' money when they're too dense to realize they could get more elsewhere."}
{"text":"A lover of their food truck since day one, the restaurant is a delicious alternative when the truck isn't around. I love that they host a lot of non profit fundraising events for local organizations. Pittsburgh is lucky to have Franktuary. They've come a long way since their inception!"}
{"text":"I'm a creature of habit when I go to the same places on a regular basis. For instance I always get fries and the standard dog.
Food is still good here but not like it was in days gone by. I do still come on occasion.
I was recently disappointed to find the drink specials have been changed.
Still a decent Pittsburgh business."}
{"text":"It's OK. Beer list is good, atmosphere is good. We had a specialty dog, sausage and cheese, chick pea fries and onion rings. Having been to other dog places in other cities we just feel like things could be stepped up a notch."}
{"text":"Oh the possibilities! This place is gonna rock it out in Lawrenceville, I just know it. Just looking at the cocktail menu got me excited for what's to come... too bad it was a lunch time meal.

But really, not that bad because my lunch was suburb. It's restaurant week, so the deal was two meatball subs and poutine to share for $20.13. Not bad at all. I am a sucker for a potato bun, so I was excited to see it beautifully presented on one. The meatballs were large and in charge and there was a tasty blanket of mozz cheese laid out on top. You can get either gravy or marinara and I, of course being Italian, went with the red. I wish there was a tad more sauce on the sub, but I'm a saucy kind a gal...

The poutine was not a let down in the taste department either. Loads of gravy, crispy fries and... cheesecurds. Cheesecurds are made straight from heaven, I swear. I only wish there were more! 

The place itself is beautiful. Of course, there are church pews as seats, but no confessions needed. Unless you confess how awesome this place is!"}
{"text":"Hot diggity dog these are darn good hot dogs!

I am ashamed at not coming here much sooner!  But in my lame defense, it's tucked away in in the back of Trinity Cathedral.  All tiny and unassuming.  Even when you first walk into the \"church\" doors, you have to ask yourself, am I coming here to confess some sins or eat some sinfully delicious dogs?

After reading through the many reviews on here I decided to opt for the \"healthy\" locavore dog.  It's awesome they carry this particular dog because it's made local AND doesn't have all those little mystery ingrediants that our other little dog friend has.  As soon as I read banana peppers I was sold on the Chicago Imposter gourmet dog.  It also comes with a whole pick, relish, tomatoes and celery salt.  It was really a great dog, although I still had to add ketchup, because we are in fact deeply in love, to the point where I have to add it to anything burger, dog, fry related.  

I was sad to find out they were out of their slaw because I'm a huge fan of the slaw, when made right.  I opted to get the Greek Salad instead.  Good for me they were out of the slaw because the Greek Salad was KILLER!  I had to ask if it was made in house and it in fact is made by one of the chefs there.  It comes HIGHLY suggested!  I had to carefully inspect the salad so I could figure out how to make it at home.  Artichokes, cucumbers, banana peppers, orange peppers, onion, tomatoes and olive oil....amazingness!  To be completely honest, I don't think I'd have been disappointed by any of the sides because I had to steal a taste of my friends baked beans and they were also stellar!  

Mega plus, they carry Boyle's soda!  I love me some Diet Cream Soda (I know...diet + hot dog = defeats the purpose).  AND, they give you a fun little gummy hot dog treat.  So freakin' cute!

Totally cheap option for anyone working/lunching or visiting dahntahn Pixburgh!  Then you can head into the church and tell God how thankful you are he created hot dogs.  Amen!"}
{"text":"The best part of dinner was our server Jess. She was delightful. As for the food, overpriced mediocre hotdogs and several hipster dishes. YUK!! Hand cut fries were limp and covered with a pasty tasteless gray gravy. YUK The crowd was lively and having fun playing a trivia game. Eat at home and go for drinks!"}
{"text":"Franktuary was one of my very favorite places in Pittsburgh, and the Lawrenceville location is definitely the best. The atmosphere is great, with old church pews and other repurposed objects decorating the restaurant. The staff is always super friendly and service has been exceptionally speedy every time I've been here. 

The food is great, with more of a selection here than at the downtown location. All of the hot dogs are good, but be sure to ask about whatever monthly special they have going on. The Memphis is a personal favorite of mine. They also have local hot dogs and sausages and source a bunch of other ingredients from local farms. And whatever you do, get the poutine. Seriously, it's amazing. 

They also have a pretty good beer selection and they can pour a mean cocktail."}
{"text":"the menu here is not as extensive as it is at D's, but the quality is better and the options are plenty good enough. get the pittsburgh hot dog (with pierogi and cole slaw) to really embrace the local flavor. 

also: the hours are really meant to serve to downtown business crowd (10-3 on week days only), but there's free wifi and a friendly staff to serve you your dog."}
{"text":"Pimms No. 2, perogies, and poutine were highlights. I was excited to find a place with vegetarian gravy, such that I could finally try poutine! It was salty, but good, especially with the green onions (more please!). The VLT was decent, while the Pittsburgh with a vegetarian dog was pretty good. The Mangorita was harsh upon first trying it, but got better as I drank it. Overall, great comfort food. I will be back."}
{"text":"We usually are massive fans of this place but I have to say yesterday was a disappointment.  After hyping this place to out of town guests we showed up for lunch yesterday around 1:30pm with 8 people.  After waiting for a table to be put together we were informed that it was a brunch only menu and there were no normal hot dogs avail.  We looked at the menu and decided to go somewhere else..  Please retain a normal menu during brunch, you lost out on a decent sized table because no one was interested in the brunch offerings."}
{"text":"Did someone say gourmet hot dogs?  Umm, get out of my way, please...NOW!

When I discovered that Franktuary was around the corner of my hotel, you couldn't hold me back from sinking my teeth into one (or several) of their juicy dogs.  The Chicago Imposter and Buffalo are easily my favorites.  The salty bite of that celery salt in the Chicago dog is quite lovely.  I entertained the idea of trying the Pittsburgh but can't seem to get past the idea of melding the worlds of pierogies and dogs into the same bite.  Meh.  I do wish they offered other kinds of buns though (i.e., potato buns) but maybe I'm just being picky.

I really appreciate the mission at Franktuary: serving up great, quality food in the ever humble dog (though these are no ordinary dogs by any means).  But it will cost you.  The standard dog starts at $3.25 and the green locavore dog will cost you up to $6.  If you eat the way I do, that can easily add up!

Their location is ideal being in the center of downtown but their hours really stink.  Closed at 3pm on weekdays and closed on weekends?  Ugh!!  Looks like I will have to rearrange my schedule.  The things I do for wieners."}
{"text":"I was here last Saturday night around 10pm and we were seated immediately. I love the venue and the bar, and the service was great, but I was a little disappointed in the hot dogs! I hate to admit this, but hot dogs are one of my favorite foods. I don't eat them often and was super excited to try the gourmet hotdogs at Franktuary. My friend and I each ordered two and split them, so I got to try 4 different styles. We had the Athens, the Mexico, the Pittsburgh, and the Memphis. The Mexico was definitely my favorite, but it was nothing I couldn't whip together in my kitchen. I think I would have liked a heftier hot dog too. I did get to try to garbanzo fries as well though, and they were fantastic - definitely worth stopping in for!"}
{"text":"I love it here! Their poutine is delicious and a must-order. There are options for people with dietary restrictions and I love seeing a fun twist on a classic food."}
{"text":"Last time I was there on a Saturday night, they were swamped, slow, and the food came out cold and soggy.  I was underwhelmed, but a friend insisted on going last week and I am glad I gave Franktuary another chance!

It was a week night, the place was busy, but we were able to be seated without a wait, and there was plenty of wait staff available who were all friendly, fast, and attentive.  Their signature dogs were as inventive and premium as ever, and this time everything came out very fresh including crispy indulgent Poutine fries.  The prices were certainly higher than your average dog and fries, but you absolutely get more than you pay for.

Based on my first experience, I'd still be a bit nervous coming here at a peak busy time like Saturday night, but any other time, I'd be thrilled to spend some bank with Frank!"}
{"text":"All I can say is. Just try the corn dog. It's so good! Their daily specials are pretty cool. Unimpressed with their \"poutine\". For example, the BLT poutine was fries on top of a bed of lettuce (who does that?) with some aioli drizzled over them and a few bacon and tomato crumbles. Also, it gets very hot/stuffy in there!"}
{"text":"Here's what I like about Franktuary:
Friendly, attentive staff
Everything is local, local, local - local meats, cheeses, potatoes, liquors, beers, etc.
Unique hot dog combos, including the option to have your dog wrapped in lettuce
Special events - every Tuesday is Trivia Night starting at 7, def. will be back to check that out soon!

Here's what I don't like about Franktuary:
The prices.  I understand keeping everything local increases the price, but 60 bucks for 4 hots dogs and 4 drinks?  Ehhhhh.....that's too much, and this was with a Happy Hour discount on 2 of the drinks.  The hot dogs are tasty, and the drinks are delicious and refreshing, just a little too pricey overall.

I'll be back for Tuesday Trivia Night; my recommendation is to stick to beer here and maybe only have one hot dog and/or one cocktail for a more reasonably priced evening.  I do LOVE the Church Wine - at 6 bucks a glass, it's a splurge, though!"}
{"text":"I love the hot dogs and you have to see this place love the setup!!!! that what makes this place a great cheap place to get you eat on!!!"}
{"text":"Neat place!

I stopped in on a common, overcast, weekday during the lunch hour to find a very inviting restaurant in Lawrenceville. 

I sat at the bar, as it was just a quick lunch stop with yours truly. I was greeted by the very pleasant Jess, with whom I also had a fun conversation at the end of my stay. 

I ordered the Reykjavik and the mini baked poutine. The dog came with a remoulade, ketchup, mustard, onion, and fried onions. If I was going to suggest anything, I would recommend holding the mustard. I think the remoulade was overshadowed by the mustard. The poutine was AMAZING. Fries, sharp cheddar, scallions, jalapeños, sour cream, and house bacon. Oh, the bacon. This was the coup d'état. It was smoked and thick-sliced. It was a delight. 

Really fun lunch here, and I'd like to return to try some of their other creations, especially those with kimchi."}
{"text":"Did not know what to expect as the only hot dog place I have previously entertained was the Original Hot Dog Shop in Oakland. Franktuary is a larger place than some of the other eateries in Lawrenceville as it looks like they combined two store fronts. Plenty of seating. Very quaint place. The waitress was very nice and for a time was the only one waiting tables. How she kept up the pace was beyond me, She even took care of the bar patrons! Talk about hustle!! Anyhow I ordered a style my own hot dog with the grass fed beef, relish and onions and of course, bacon. Also ordered a smoked kielbasi. Had a side order of fries with cheese curds and gravy. The food arrived pretty quick. The hot dog had that snap when you bit into it. You could tell that it wasn't a eight pack hot dog from your local grocer. It was meaty. Very good. The kielbasi was also very meaty. Not your run of the mill kielbasi. Just the right seasoning  made for a great taste. The fries could have been crisper  as they were somewhat soggy but with the gravy and cheese curls, they offered a nice change from your regular french fries. I wish I could remember to take pictures. I shall return."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. Leave it to Pittsburgh to have a gourmet hot dog joint. The over all look and feel of the restaurant is modern but also approachable and relaxed. The menu is simple so everything that you order is sure to impress.

I tried several dogs that night and I kind of regret the third choice, not because it wasn't good but because I think two is enough from most anyone especially if you get fries. Speaking of fries the fries were delicious. I hear the cheese curd fries are also awesome, something you will be hard pressed to find elsewhere I'm sure. 

Decent beer selection and a variety of meat and even veggie hot dog options makes Franktuary a happy place, even for your weird vegan friends. 

I had a great experience and will look forward to trying Franktuary again very soon."}
{"text":"I didn't even like hotdogs until I tried Franktuary. Awesome spot, except on Sundays there menu changes and they have very few hotdogs."}
{"text":"Delicious drinks and wonderful server!! I had never tried a Pimm's Cup before so the server generously brought me a sample to try before I committed to the drink! Delicious. A definite must try!"}
{"text":"If you love hot dogs, then Franktuary is the place to be in the Burgh. If you find hot dog specific restaurants ridiculous, then I would still recommend Franktuary because it really hits the spot even if you think it's too pretentious or hipster or whatever. I've taken loads of friends here and never left disappointed although I have left ridiculously full (the poutine really packs a punch despite its deliciousness). I highly recommend the happy hour deal which includes $4 drafts, $1 off cocktails, and 1/2 off poutine and feature franks from 4-6 pm Tuesdays-Fridays. I've heard mixed reviews about Franktuary's brunch, but overall they do most things well. I'm gonna keep going until I conquer the whole menu!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the basement of a church on a side street downtown, Franktuary is a little gem that is worth seeking out. It's a hot dog joint, but they also offer salads, wraps, and fruit smoothies. They even have a veggie dog, and a locally grown option too -- the Locavore, an organic, grass-fed beef dog, which is tasty and filling. It's on special during the month of July.

The counter service is laid-back and friendly, and they call you by name instead of a number. The meal might set you back a few pennies more than the fast food places up the street, but it's the little touches like this that elevate Franktuary to a higher ground."}
{"text":"It isn't that Franktuary is bad, it is just way overpriced and way overrated. 

Their hot dogs range from classic to extravagant with many options in between, but nothing really grabs your gut and twists, bellowing, \"Eat me you silly beast! I was made for you and you alone.\" 

Some of the waitstaff act a bit too cool for school. I mean, I get it, you slang fancy hotdogs downtown to flabby baby boomers and young professional bros. Still, cheer up a bit, kids. It isn't the end of the world."}
{"text":"I'm so on the fence about dinner at Franktuary tonight.  There were so many great things going on that were unexpected. I will take the kids back. I'm really excited to find uncured turkey dogs on the menu for the kids! Very exciting!  I'm so glad to be able to have soy free & pork free choices for my kids. The poultry choice is excellent.  

On the other hand- my sons kids meals- what came out was NOT what I ordered him. Uh. It was a turkey dog just not styled how it was ordered. So be it. It was late. He was really hungry and tired. And who cares if his hot dog wasn't shaped like a sea creature or something. I don't know but, it definitely wasn't what I ordered him.  He's a toddler so he doesn't really know that his meal was messed up.  The waitress brought out a side of shredded cheese. I cut it up into small pieces. He happily put cheese on everything and ate it. It was all the same to him. I think his meal was also supposed to come with gummies. No sign on them during or after dinner. Not sure why....  oh well. His dinner also came with fries. I had asked for cheese curds & gravy for his fries. He had cheese shreds and chili come out. Close. He was happy with the shreds. And He didn't  know it wasn't what was ordered and wasn't what he had the last time there with his Canadian uncle. So he happily ate the cheese shreds with the fries. Eh, he was hungry and he ate it happily. So. Whatever. He liked it. I can't say I was impressed with our service but the kiddo was pleased. 

As for my \"meal\".  I ordered a turkey dog with cheese with a glass of wine. Along with fries.  The wine I was served was bad as in it had turned. I had to let the server know.  Gross.  Not our best dining experience but better than our last at Franktuary. We'll be back.  It seems to be improving."}
