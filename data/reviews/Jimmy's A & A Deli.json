{"text":"There is no better shawarma in the city. They add the perfect ingredients - nothing too obscure, but still enough flavour. It doesn't take much to order - they just grab your name and off you go. It's not too greasy, full of flavour, and though it's a little messy - it is quite the satisfying meal.   I crave Jimmy's. I tell everyone to go there, it's simply fantastic."}
{"text":"Best chicken shwarma ever!! The portion is HUGE! I usually get medium and I am stuffed.  I love all the fresh fillings and the staff is always upbeat.  Never been disappointed from this place.  The only downside is no where to sit in the winter.  And don't attempt to eat in the car, you will be a disaster.  And although the shwarma is amazing, save it for at least a second date, its kind of awkward to eat and you might end up wearing it!"}
{"text":"BEST CHICKEN SHWARMA I have ever had!!   I will go to Jimmy's again and again not just for the food but the awesome group of people that work there.   I tried to order a medium last time, and the server told me to get a small unless I hadn't eaten for a week - he was right, I could barely finish the small, and apparently the medium weights a full pound.   I also love their chicken jamaican patties, baklava, and dips, it really is more than a donair shop and a great place to buy some snacks for entertaining."}
{"text":"Great food; insane service.  I mean, Jimmy is engaging, but also kind of scary.  Who is that friendly all the time?   The portions are big, prices are small, and the deli has tonnes of specialty mediterranean items (if you are looking for rosewater or mysterious canned goods with only arabic writing).  You can buy hookahs & shisha too.    But seriously: try the falafel, shawarma or donair if you're into beef.  This place is a gem."}
{"text":"I often come here for the beef donair. They have a whole bunch of other food here including samosas, hot and cold salads, and other deep fried foods. Their donairs are stuffed with a lot of meat, which is different from most other places. I've had friends out East who are donair connoisseurs who tell me this place has the best donair they've ever had.  This place is fucking awesome!"}
{"text":"I don't know what food all the positive reviewer have been eating but the food is ok at best.   Stay away shwarma has a lot of fat and has no taste."}
{"text":"Jimmy's is a local favorite...however if you know arab food pretty well it is difficult to pay the high price for the yummy selections at this store.There are many other places in the NE that charge half the amount and are just as good if not better with some items. But NOT the donair..Jimmy has that down! I will also say the friendly staff and fun atmosphere at Jimmy's are quite the experience. For this alone I visit often..   THANK YOU Jimmy & your wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fabulous! From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but you need to try it! The food is amazing. I had a beef donair and it was the largest and tastiest one I've ever had! I also tried a chicken samosa, which is also delicious. They have tons of fresh deli food and I took home some hummus.   I think what makes this place really great though is the staff. They are so incredibly friendly and make you feel like you are a valued customer. Jimmy's does a great job!!"}
{"text":"Best place in the city for chicken shawarmas and beef donairs in the city.  While are both delish, the chicken shawarmas in my opinion are significantly better.  I have been coming to this place for 16 years now.  It looks like a dive (even after the renovations they did several years ago), but the quality of the food cannot be dismissed.  Sausage rolls and the baklava are pretty good as well.  For the price, quality and amount of food it's one of the best deals in the city by far.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Go. Right now. And expect to come home with a bag full of homemade groceries."}
{"text":"I used to live right by Jimmy's. If I had a guest and they wanted a quick bite, I'd always take them here. The portions are misleading - a small is sufficient for most people. I would sometimes share a large shawarma salad with a friend and we'd be stuffed.  Their baklava is made in house and delicious. Their spicy hummus is delicious."}
{"text":"Jimmy's has the both the biggest and best donairs I have ever seen! It's on my way home from work, and I'm becoming a regular.   The large is the size of your face. If you have a huge face. Eat here.   Yay!"}
{"text":"As a recent Calgary transplant I have been reeling from the high cost of everything. Which means that I was extra delighted to stumble across Jimmy's. Fair prices, huge portions and such yummy food. I've had the shwarma and the falafel wraps- both are fantastic but the shwarma is the star of this place.  The wraps are huge and insanely messy but oh so tasty.  They also have a variety of food in their deli case, salads, hummus, spanikopita, etc.  I would recommend the vegetarian samosas-but they tend to run out of these on the early side.  Oh! and of course the baklava. The baklava here is amazing, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.   It's a pick up kind of place but there are a few tables outside."}
{"text":"This particular establishment is hard to for me to be objective about because over the past several years I have been frequenting them, I have become friends with the family. For those who are reading this blog, I must qualify my review as being slightly biased. However, I am being truthful when I say that pretty much everything they sell is expertly prepared, locally made and fresh.  My favourites are the Kafta (a potato and ground beef dish - Lebanese Shepards Pie?), that Zatar (pita shell baked with herb, tomato, or ground beef), Fatyre (a Lebanese pastry stuffed with either feta and sour spinach or spiced ground beef), the olive bar, and, of course, their Donair and Sharwama sandwiches. A large sandwich is good for two meals. Take some Baclava home with you for dessert.   Three months ago they converted the floor upstairs into a well maintained very clean dining area."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the community you wouldn't think the best donairs are made in this tiny deli. I've driven by it so many times and never thought to go in. A friend introduced me and it was amazing! Would recommend Jimmy's if they haven't been before. You'd be surprised like I was and keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Last week I decided to take on the Behemoth that is the Jimmy's Large Donair ( see profile picture).  The Donair is easily learge enough to beat a baby seal to death with and probably contained as much meat.   Great Donairs but trying to fit that much meat on a regualr pita is ridiculous; please Jimmy get some proper sized pitas.  Service here is slow at the best of times but usually worth the wait ; I would say close to top for Donairs in the city."}
{"text":"Best Donair in the city. Its just too much food, goes soggy before your hungry enough to eat the rest."}
{"text":"I will always give them a 5 star rating! Food is awesome-sauce! \"Epic\", as what my 9 yr old son would say. He gets some free sweets once in a while which makes him want to eat here even more!"}
{"text":"I once made the mistake of ordering a medium falafel sandwich, because I was starving . It was the size of my head. Im not going to complain about huge portions, which Jimmy's has, but be warned, unless you want to cart around a half of a left over sandwichor (gasp) throw it away, just order a small (this applies to guys too). There are other options if you arent into eating a full meal, olives, fatayer, zaatar, meat pies, empanadas, falafel balls, dolmades...the list goes on.  The only thing I find over priced is the shelved product in the store. If you dont mind going a little out of the way, many of these items can be found at a lower price."}
{"text":"Okay, so this place gets 5 stars because of 2 things that happened here:  1) My friend's name is Jimmy too so he got super personal and friendly service (just for the kicks I guess). 2) Shawarma here is gigantic!  I don't particularly like the fact that its sweet, but it still is very delicious (and BIG, HUGE for the price!!!)  The parking space is never enough, neither are the seats because so many people are always here (big lineups) but even then, this place scores big due to service & food quality.  Definitely recommended!!!"}
{"text":"You might not know it from the other reviews, but this is really four types of stores rolled into one.  Clearly, their most popular aspect is the donair/shwarma prep.  For Haligonians missing their sweet sauce donairs, this is THE place to go. The only shortcoming is that the meat is in a warming tray rather than shaved off a spinning hunk o' meat when ordered (like the shwarma), but on the plus side you get lettuce, and the portions are generous.  I would only suggest getting a large if you're returning from an Antarctic expedition and ran out if supplies half way through.  I would also stay away from them all together if you plan on going on a date in the next couple of days, unless your potential partner is turned on by the garlicky miasma you and your vehicle will inevitably exude.  Another caveat is that it can take a while to get your meal during peak hours, but on plus side they provide amusing reading materials while you stand around and wait.  As I alluded to earlier, there are other aspects to the store as well.  A sizeable selection of cold prepared middle eastern foods such as kubbi balls are available to go, as well as an array of baklavas, and various cheeses and olives in bulk.  An assortment of Arabic dry goods can be purchased too, such as sheesha supplies, pomegranate molasses, sumac seasoning, etc.. In the summer, an ice cream parlor is in full force, and you can sit at the few tables out on the sidewalk, or in the upstairs seating area.  As a converted house, the whole experience is somewhat cramped, the atmosphere slightly ghetto, but most importantly the food very delicious."}
{"text":"Not overly amazing but good shawarma and fast service. Easy location and lots of outdoor seating"}
{"text":"If your looking for an explosion of flavour. May I suggest a large Mixed (chicken and beef) shawarma . Hope you have an appetite though...!!!"}
{"text":"I am lucky enough to live within lazy-walking distance of Jimmy's. I'm actually surprised I don't eat here more, but I've eaten enough of this delicious food to tell everyone they need to at least try it once!  As other fabulous yelpers have been so wonderfully detailed in explaining the awesomeness of this place, I'll just repeat what I think requires repeating.  DO NOT ORDER A LARGE! Unless you plan to feed your family of four or you yourself are a blue whale.  I can be known to pack away a good sized meal and have been commended in this ability by a number of friends but I never eat more than a small from Jimmy's. Especially because you NEED to have room for that Baklava. and I mean NEED to."}
{"text":"Jimmy's A & A probably is the best value for shawarma in Calgary.  I've been going here since it was a real convenience store and they have not changed a thing.  The decor inside the store now looks a lot more like a donair shop with all the middle eastern deli items.    The shawarma/shish taook's here are gigantic.  Well...  not the biggest in the world I presume, but when you order a small you get a wrap filled with about half a kilo of meat in it.   If I'm ever having a craving something heavy garlicy and delicious I go here."}
{"text":"I have recently found out about the infractions alberta health has found at jimmys. Rotten tomatoes, unsanitary washrooms and that is just a few. I am lookin for more as I used to eat here once a week but have now stopped after finding out about these infractions."}
{"text":"Good shawarma that doesn't feel heavy after eating,  it has Mediterranean herbs but it's not spicy at all. It's good but not authentic labenese or syrian , more like an americanised version."}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times and really liked the food. Its a long drive from where i live but it was worth it. But the food is not as fresh anynore and recently when i've gone to pay for my food, this guy with curly hair and glasses, seems like one of the owners, has always had something clever to say. I guess he thinks its okay to treat customers that way, extremely disrespectful."}
{"text":"Fantastic shawarma with all the fixin's! Garlic sauce is super delicious and the garnishes are very fresh! My wife and daughter love the donairs with the sweet sauce! Jimmy is awesome and funny! They really look after their customers and seriously they want you to have fun in the line up which can be long during lunch or dinner, but trust me it's worth the wait! I read a review from someone who said they thought the food was flavourless all I have to know is does that person use dog poop as toothpaste? It is delicious, do yourself a favour and go try it!!"}
{"text":"I had my very first donair from Jimmy's about 2 weeks ago when I was in Calgary visiting my cousin.  I had an amazing experience. The staff are very friendly, and the food was amazing!  I got the beef donair with garlic sauce. DELICIOUS. I got a small. It looked like it was bordering on a large. I also got a Jamaican meat patty. My first ever Jamaican meat patty, and it was delicious as well. Cousin and I each had a baklava. The baklava was a perfect dessert.   One word sums up Jimmy's: DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"It has never been easier to give a place 5 stars.  Got a combo wrap which includes chicken and beef, with your choice of fresh veggies, topped with garlic sauce and/or hot sauce (I got mine with sweet sauce just because).  I gotta say, the wrap was incredible. Meat was tender and juicy, sauce was on point, veggies were plentiful and fresh, even the pita was soft and warm. My goal now is to find a place that does donair/shawarma wraps better than Jimmy's, and I'm kind of hoping to eventually come to the conclusion that Jimmy's is still the best.  The service was great if not better than the food. Staff were attentive and the manager was easygoing and upbeat. There's also a huge selection of samosa, baklava, and cold drinks and a corner full of incense, spices, and other obscure items you can't find at your local Wal-Mart. My friend is using some of the spices he found here for his barbeque party and I am so excited to try it."}
{"text":"Okay, hands down, best Baklava in Calgary. Do not pass go, do not collect 200$, go directly to Jimmy's and get your fix!   As for Shawarma, 2 times out of three I have loved it. Messy, meaty goodness! But, that one time, the meat was so fat (yuck!). What's up with that? Anyway, maybe it was just that day. I'm still going to try it again.  Donairs are really good too! And yes, the portions at Jimmy's are pretty huge! I think it's great! I also like their samosas. Great for a snack if you don't want a huge donair.  I like the staff here too, they are really friendly and treat you like family, they joke around and stuff when its not busy.  I'm all about the mom and pop type places :)"}
{"text":"Chicken Shwarma.. epic! Fast service, hot and warm and nifty things to look at while waiting. I live next to the one on 4th, and yes I know they are the same, but for some reason the one on 20th is 10x better. I always get the small, otherwise I wouldnt be able to finish it. Boyfriend got the large, it was pretty much the size of his head and I got us forks to help us eat.  Still amazeballs...... will be back"}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions, when I used to live in the area. The veggies tasted stale or on the verge of rotten each time. The chicken in the shawarma had bones in it. The food prep area seems less than sanitary.   Just not my kind of place!"}
{"text":"Terrific shawerma and friendly staff who placated my upset toddler with a lollipop.    It did seem a little bit disorganized. We had a large order and they left out some falafel, and were quite surprised when I came back for it.  I didn't have any cash on me (long story) so I got the side-eye for trying to \"steal\" free food, but my friends who come here often say they always have to double check their order."}
{"text":"My first visit to Jimmy's it was clear I was unsure what I wanted. Regulars were coming up behind me ordering like they do it everyday, which is probably not a stretch!   I was offered a sample dish (with generous portions of meats and sauces!) and settled on the donair, and was easily convinced to grab a beef samosa as well.  Although it's a deli, they have bistro tables with umbrellas set outside so you can have lunch al fresco and enjoy the day.  I got a small wrap and it was still HUGE! Chock full of meat, lettuce, tomato and jalapenos with the creamy garlic sauce mmmmm  Great first experience here, and it definitely won't be my last!"}
{"text":"if you are looking for a massive, and delicious donair, go to Jimmys! the portions are huge! very nice, clean deli, and super friendly staff"}
{"text":"Wow...did we ever stumble on a little gem....since we are fresh off Vancouver...finding yummy food that's worth spending is hard to find in Calgary!  Yes Vancouverites are spoiled with the plethora of food offered there.  Nevertheless the staff was fast and friendly and entertained my toddler and gave him two lollipops...yes..he did quite the rendition of a song.  We came from Confederation park and stumbled upon here on a rainy day.  Always gotta be good if there are people outside eating right?  Gotta love hole in the walls.  Their do airs are to die for and their sauce is phenomenal!  Definitely worth the drive here!  NOM NOM NOM....I wish I could freeze their yummy food...lol"}
{"text":"I would give this place higher reviews but I did not like the bugs flying around inside.The sandwiches are plentiful and tasty, but I am not sure if I would go back because of all the flying insects."}
{"text":"Time for an update.   My last review was about Jimmy's shwarma, and after trying more shwarmas around the city I've come to realize I don't even like shwarma. Can't fault Jimmy's for that! :) After realizing I wasn't down with shwarma's I decided to come back to Jimmy's to again see what all the fuss was about.  I have had both a small fallafel and a small donair. Both rocked, but the donair really sealed the deal. I will be back for that. I also still love the beverage selection.  I have also purchased olives from the olive bar, and they rule! The feta stuffed olives are a favourite."}
{"text":"Best schwarmas in the city... And portions are unbelievably huge!! (and I have a huge appetite)"}
{"text":"After a hot sweaty day at work with no breaks allllll daaaay,  we were absolutely starving when we were NW looking for a place to finally grab some dinner , we came across jimmys a&a. What a fantastic find !! Not sure if I want to tell others about it ?? So very busy already !! But I gotta put that word out there it was too good !!!  Too good !!!! Make sure if you order a large anything there you are with about four others !! Portions are huge and so very tasty !!! Love this place will be returning again .. And again .. And again ... And maybe even again !!!!"}
{"text":"Great obscure joint. Off the beaten path but a neighborhood gem.   Love the soda selections and gyro. Best in town."}
{"text":"The service from the staff was excellent, the food is very generously portioned... the baked goods isle is mesmerizing.  We had the beef donair and chicken schawarma. We ordered the small, and it was already bigger than the size of my face.  Beware of super garlic-y breath after consuming food from Jimmy's.   Awesome beyond words.  You can also get everything from hookas to pita bread while you're there waiting for your food to be served.  What a great little local joint!"}
{"text":"I've frequented a few times before, and have enjoyed the food here each time. The last time I visited was no exception. My donair was completely satisfying, and I loved every juicy bite. My veggie samosa was an even match, a wonderful combination of spice and flavour.   However, shortly after eating my meal this time, I experienced dizziness, headache, and a light-headed sensation.  I'm no stranger to MSG since I eat at Chinese places often enough. I'm also no stranger to being dosed with MSG at said Chinese places. I'm saddened, but I will no longer return to this restaurant.   There's a reason why every bite is so delicious. None too good for anyone."}
{"text":"They have a variety of food there, i was very excited the first time I went there, and the guy was very friendly.."}
{"text":"Most favorite place for shawarma and donairs... writing this review because I am craving it lol. Solid food and service that is attentive and efficient. So many other food items along the line that you can purchase as well. Great value! Visit here if you haven't. All is delish. Only recommendation would be for them to fix the setup a little as the way it is organized causes a bit of a wait where if you order more than one item, then there's a good chance there will be an additional wait time for each item. The orders are not linked to each other and not worked on at the same time. So what ends up happening is some people after you may get their orders before you. Can't be mad though, still worth it haha!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday at noon, ordered a medium beef donair.  Positives:  Donair style was generally authentic, pita piled high with donair meat, plenty of sauce, onions and tomatoes. You're also given the option of adding lettuce, banana peppers and sriracha. Beef was seasoned well, vegetables were fresh, sauce was fine.   They offer a lot of ready-to-eat deli items here: samosas, empanadas, jamacian patties, baklava, all types of olives, salads, etc. They also have a fairly wide variety of cold drinks and sodas, canned goods, and misc deli offerings.   Negatives:  By the time I got my sandwich, the beef was completely cold! There were a few people in line ahead of me, but it wasn't extraordinarily busy by any means. I was quite disappointed with this, and have reduced the rating accordingly.  They don't accept credit card, and didn't have the appropriate signage. It's 2017 Jimmy! If you don't accept credit card you need a MASSIVE sign at the ordering station that says \"WE DO NOT ACCEPT CREDIT CARD\". This is one of my biggest pet peeves with restaurants: springing 'cash/debit only' on me at the last minute. Maybe there was a sign and I missed it, but I think I took a good look around when I entered.  Verdict:  I think I'll return to try out some of the deli offerings, but I'll stick to Jerusalem Shawarma up in Harvest Hills for my sandwiches. Cold meat on a donair was really disappointing."}
{"text":"If you want a serious, generous, flavourful shwarma, this will do the trick!  It is a fun place to visit. They have a great variety of tempting (so far all good) take-out items. The Jamaican patties are yummy and they often sell out. They have a nice selection of delicious baklava. It is great for take-out or casual sit-in dining. They have some fun grocery items too. Whenever I go, I pick up a few bars of the Olive Oil soap they carry. The service has been friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"i always come here when i visit calgary! shawarma is awesome!!! fun an friendly staff baklava is the best ive ever had!! melts in your mouth goodness! i always get the 12 pck back for my husband and he does the same for me when he goes there without me."}
{"text":"Jimmy's A & A Deli is la creme de la creme, the icing on the cake, and in this case, THE best schawarma and falafel place I have been to in Calgary. Oh, and did I mention that not ONLY is the food taste bud- tantalizing, but the prices are some of the cheapest around?!?!? I'm talkin' 2 people can eat a DISGUSTING amount of food, feel like they've been to heaven and back AT LEAST a couple of times, and want to come back for more for the rest of their lives. And at what cost comes this whole body experience you ask? $15 dollars...for BOTH people. SAY WHAAAAAT?!?!?!   Where else in the city can you get a meal bigger than your head for less than $8?!?!? YOU CAN\"T.   During the winter it's a grab and go kinda place, there's nowhere to sit inside, so you KNOW the service will be fast.  In the summer, the service is just as fast and exceptional and if you're in the mood, you can pull up one of the chairs they set up for their patrons and eat, digest and enjoy the view, all at once.   Seriously people: if you haven't tried Jimmy's A & A Deli, you haven't lived a full life. Put it on your bucket list and GET THERE."}
{"text":"best donairs in the city, mostly because they have the best meat. donairs are overpriced though - they should knock a couple of bucks of the price of each size.  People like to say how \"huge\" these sandwiches are, but it's really because 75% of the sandwich is lettuce.  Order it without lettuce sometime and you'll see what I mean."}
{"text":"A good friend had been raving about this place for a long time. Had to finally check it out! Well that was certainly the best donair I've had in Calgary so far! Surprisingly moist beef, not the usual dry stuff. I had also half of a chicken shawarma that was very yummy. Loved the herbs and spice they seasoned the chicken with (usually chicken is kind of bland in other places). The veggies in both chicken and beef version would plentiful and fresh. Awesome garlic sauce. Incredible olives, definitely worth paying the extra bucks. Very friendly staff, the prices are a bit higher than I expected, but I can't complain. Paying a bit more for quality justifies it.  I wish they had more sitting area outside, maybe with parasols because in the spring and summer sitting in the sun is not fun for some people (myself including). Also may I suggest a functioning air conditioning inside the establishment, the heat from the cooking area is a bit much. The store is awesome, lots of goodies from many countries around the Mediterranean Ocean. Will be back soon, Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food.   Less stars if I were including the interior, so be ready for that.  Big portions,  you will leave full.  I've been going for about fifteen years,  only real change I've seen is they started nuking the chicken before serving it.   Which I'm sure it's a precaution more than anything, still delicious"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant and market in Calgary.  Prior to my vacation in the mountains, I wanted to take time to get to know the city, and I researched places to eat and drink that I thought would be in my comfort zone.  Jimmy's was just around the corner from the residence tower at SAIT where I spent my first night of the trip...I was concerned that they would close before I got settled in my room, so I popped in for a bite to eat with my backpack attached to me. I let the nice lady who greeted me know right away that I had just arrived from San Diego and was pretty hungry...when I told her that I had specifically chosen to eat at Jimmy's based on what I had seen and read online, she told Jimmy's brother Mo about it.  To say that Mo took care of me would be an understatement. We chatted it up about the various differences between Canada and the US, California and Alberta, as well as the restaurant scene in my city. I had a medium Beef Donair, an order of Baba Ganug and some Baklava...it was delicious, portions were ridiculously large...and as good as any middle eastern restaurant I've dined at in the States.   As I traveled throughout Canmore, Lake Louise, Yoho NP and Golden, I told anyone familiar with Calgary who would listen to me to make the effort to find Jimmy's A&A Deli...and I'll do the same thing here as well. It's slightly off the main drags of 16th Ave and 14th St, yet still easy to locate. I'll be back as soon as possible, guaranteed."}
{"text":"Excellent quick food and nice friendly staff. Donair, sides, and baklava were all fantastic on my several meals there."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, little expensive, but good quality and great employees. One of my faves"}
{"text":"I downloaded YELP app and registered just to leave a review to this place. Yes, I love it THAT much! If you love Mediterranean cuisine - you must visit. Take out or stay and eat - you won't regret it.  Ordered large donairs - just great. But you better be hungry cause large means \"giant\". And make sure you get their garlic sauce. You won't regret. Family owned, these guys are high-class professionals and serve your food with kindness and passion. I believe this is the place which would not roll down with time. You better try once and see by yourself. But that small friendly place made my trip to Calgary even more pleasant."}
{"text":"Wow. Just Wow. I Loooove Jimmy's. I grew up in the area, and it was always a treat to go to the ole' A&A for a shwarma or donair. I have never had a bad experience with this place, and with the amount of times my family has gone over the years, believe me that's a bold statement to make. The food is always scrumptious, satisfying, fresh, and served with a smile. If consistency took a physical form it would be a Jimmy's donair.  There is something really nice about knowing when you walk in, that you will be happy with what you have when you walk out."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.   Every time i'm near Jimmy's I make an excuse to pickup a chicken shwarma. Each and every bite is packed with amazing flavour!  The price seems a bit steep at first, but then you see the size of the sandwich and know you've got lunch covered for tomorrow... hello leftovers.  There's usually a bit of a wait for your food but the staff are friendly and talkative so you'll probably have a nice conversation with the cashier while you wait... and he might give you a free bottled drink because he wants you to try a tasty new beverage - yeah, that happened!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite Donair/Schwarma place. It may be slightly more pricey compared to other places but trust me, you get your money's worth in the amount of meat they put in your Schwarma. Not to mention how delicious it tastes!  I drive by this place every day I go home and I always have to fight off the urge to stop by. Staff are very friendly and easy going. Sometimes you'll see Jimmy there!"}
{"text":"I don't get those reviews and honestly doubt their authenticity. While it is possible that some people have different preferences, this is just extreme.  The doners or shawarmas or whatever they like to call them are not authentic and have nothing to do with the real thing. They are messy and very frustrating to eat, and the portions of the different ingredients are all off. The place itself is dirty and many of the products being sold are expired or not sealed correctly.  On the bright side the staff is nice, but that's easy to come by. Anyway I would advise you to go elsewhere. If you do enjoy their sandwiches then great, but please know that they are not authentic."}
{"text":"Jimmy! What a guy. He keeps the place pumping out amazing food all day long. Good hookah selection too. Great shawarma, falafel, nice fresh pitas....everything you want in a Mediterranean deli!"}
{"text":"Great place.  A nice lady behind the counter offered us a sample of their shawarma meat with Tazaiki sauce and donair with sweet sauce.   I ended up with a large donair and sweet sauce."}
{"text":"We had been meaning to get over to this deli for awhile. Today, we finally made it happen! And on a Sat at 5pm, this place was a hoppin'! I really did not know what to expect but you enter into a modified house that has been turned into a long hall of Mediterranean goodness! Just when your eyes start to refocus from all the food you see MORE food down the line that just overwhelms the senses! I was in awe about how much stuff they had including all kinds of desserts! Gus could not have been more helpful or friendly. Laid back and not at all pushy. He was proud of his store and made our chicken shawarmas (his recommendation) for us! Stuffed they are called when the pita is split and filled with the meat, veggies (lettuce, tomato, pickles), garlic sauce, hot peppers/hot sauce if desired. The shawarmas come in 3 sizes S, M, L and honestly I could not even finish the small one. Huge and fresh! We got other goodies too, 4 of each kind of Samosas, a spicy beef Jamaican patty, a roasted chicken leg, a few desserts to try. Jimmy himself appeared and added to the good vibe of the crowded shop. At the other end where the cash register is, there are lots of grocery items and some hard to find spices and seasonings. I think I could have been in there all day just looking! There is a seating area upstairs that we went to check out to eat our food but I have to be honest - there was no one up there and it looked like a bomb had gone off. It was a mess, food everywhere on the floor and tables so we made our exit but this could just be testimony about how busy the place gets. And maybe whomever was in charge of cleaning did not make it in today. Who knows, but it will not affect us from coming back here at all. The Samosas seem a bit greasy as the paper bags were soaked by the time we got home but I am anxious to dive into those. They are huge!  Definitely worth the trip to come and check this place out. The people here work hard, are so nice, generous, and the food is Outta Sight for a decent and fair price!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! My wife and I stopped by for our first visit after work today. I must say, we were impressed. EVERYTHING is made fresh throughout the day, from the sauces, stuffed olives, samosas, shawarma, donair meats, baklava, etc etc etc. That said, expect nothing but the best in flavours, textures, and exotic aromas...wow, I love this place!  In my lifetime I've eaten shawarma, donairs, gyros, doners, etc, at various establishments across North America and Europe. Jimmy's A&A ranks up there with the best. My wife and I shared a beef donair, a chicken shawarma (both mediums), and one chicken samosa each. Yikes, had we known the portions were so massive, we may have opted for the small size. The nice thing about Jimmy's is they don't feel the need to weigh each serving like so many other Shawarmana/Donair eateries. Much to our delight, they just heaped the meat on there!  The chicken shawarma was heavenly...never have I had shawarma chicken so tender, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The flavours were out of this world. Same can be said for the beef donair...so moist! Most beef donairs I've tried in Calgary are rather dry, and sometimes one step away from being beef jerky, Lol. The beef and chicken at Jimmy's was succulent and flavourful. You could actually tell this was real meat, and not some overly processed giant hot dog on a spit! We watched and drooled as the cooks placed the seasoned chicken slices onto the spit and carried it over to the machine for cooking. Man...I want that recipe!!  Our chicken samosas were also perfect. Moist filling, with just the right amount of spice. The outer crust was nice and crisp. The turnover at Jimmy's is quick, so they're constantly replenishing the service counter. Always fresh!  Despite the fact they were quite busy, the owner was very friendly and spoke with us for awhile, as did the other staff members. They were all in good spirits and very happy. It's clear they take great pride in what they do, which is serve fantastic food in a friendly, clean, atmosphere.  We'll definitely be coming back again, and again...and again...and again..."}
{"text":"For all of those complaining about the mess.......that's like complaining about getting water in your eyes at the water park !   Jimmy's A & A is my favorite place in town to get a schwarma or donair !! Friendly staff, cool atmosphere and the best food !  they are not stingy when it comes to the amount of food per serving, they don't weigh out your meat like all of the other shops do which i find amazing !   If youre lucky enough to see jimmy he'll always tell you what cool things are going on around town !"}
{"text":"What can be said that hasn't be said about Jimmys? Delicious and a city tradition! While it is a little pricy, the amount you get makes up for it. The staff are almost all family, and it shows! This is a family business, they all really care about the quality of their food."}
{"text":"Read all the reviews so decided to go give it a try.  I must have been there on an off-day for them, or perhaps too early in the day.  The meat for the day may not have been done yet so they heated up the previous day's beef and put it into the wrap.  It was still kind of cold in the middle.  The flavor wasn't as good as I expected either.  Maybe I'll go another day and give it another try.  Maybe."}
{"text":"Seriously, I could drool just thinking about how good the food is here. The chicken shawarma is to die for! So delicious. It never fails to disappoint and I would rate it a 10/10 for every time I have been there! :)"}
{"text":"Sorry Jimmy's, you have dropped a star.    In handheld food, the construction of the product is at least as important as the contents.  Whoever assembled my last  shawarma clearly  did not understand this principle. All of my garlic sauce was at the top, all of the hot sauce was at the bottom and my hummus and tabouli were in clumps rather than spread within.    Consistency Jimmy, consistency."}
{"text":"My sister discovered this place, and raved about how it was the most authentic shawarma she has eaten in Canada. After going here a few times, I have to agree. The meat is perfectly juicy, and the small portion is huge, I am usually only able to eat half. The only thing I dislike is that you have to pay extra to add hummus and tzatziki, without which no shawarma is complete in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Yumm, shawarma and salads are great. Huge servings. Hubby always does chicken and I like the lamb with black olives. The girl at the til is a sweetie and the guy the does the orders is super friendly."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful.  Service was helpful.  Ordering, paying, and checking out was not intuitive for a first time customer."}
{"text":"Oh man. their spicy hummus is the best thing i've ever tasted. Great food, friendly people, good sized portions!"}
{"text":"I used to come here once a week, however in recent months there was a steady decline in quality culminating in a bout of food poisoning.  As a result, I would question the cleanliness and hygiene of the premises.  The food itself also lacks character, with excessive use of sauce.  In my opinion, avoid."}
{"text":"The donairs are quite flavourful, and always leave me satisfied.I enjoy a plain-Jane donair with little more than beef, lettuce, a few hot peppers, hot sauce, and sweet sauce. I find their system quite organized, and they seem to be doing quite well having a steady flow of patronage for decades now!  I'm sure the baklava is factory made. I'd just die to get some of the gooey home-made stuff! I guess that's why I'm holding out on the fifth star here--that's what I'm waiting for!"}
{"text":"Delicious beef and chicken wraps, plus an assortment of baklava and other goodies to choose from. Fast and friendly service and they even let us sample before choosing our meal! Thanks"}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday afternoon. Busy little place. Unfortunately the very charming Jimmy wasn't in his shop. I heard that he is one charming mf and I wanted to see him in action. Oh well. I ordered a small chicken wrap and I can't imagine how big a medium or large would be as the small was a mountain of food. The chicken was hot and moist, I loved the garlic sauce drizzled over the mound of fresh lettuce, pickles and peppers. I particularly enjoyed the pickles - not sweet or sour. The only issue was eating this monster of a wrap - I felt like a pig eating out of a bucket or something."}
{"text":"I couldn't say that this is the best Shawarma in the city, but what I can very well say is it's my favourite. If this situation needs some gravity added to it, well I would do terrible things, terrible unspeakable things just to get my hand on one of these delicious flavourful and fresh wraps, or even more terrible unspeakable thing if you got in the way of me enjoying them. Don't you mess with my shawarma, man! Well that got heavy real quick, but for good reason! Have you had one of these things? The chicken is moist, flavourful, very spiced and not overly greasy. What goes into a shawarma is kind of hard to explain. All of the ingredients are the same - chicken or beef, your choice of lettuce, tomato, onion, peppers, those pickled purple dealies and your choice of hot and/or garlic sauce (get them both! Go ahead, make your day, punk!) all wrapped up in a pita. Simple, right? But the way this tastes when put together at Jimmy's A&A Deli is best described by Paul G.(1)'s review of Thi Thi Subs(2) - \"it's like I just described the Eiffel tower in terms of its constituent steel beams.\" The numbers going into the shawarma equation are simple, but the final output is inexplicable, relying on art and possibly wizardry to create a concoction not achievable by science alone.   The second party of this review? The people here are so lovely! It's a family owned business and from start to finish, they make you feel like part of the family. The sign outside says \"Made with Love\" or some derivative of and oh heck yes it makes a difference. Is a blind taste test Jimmy's Shawarma going to compare with another quality no name shawarma, well I damn well think so, but even if it didn't, the people are so awesome here that the authentic friendliness and overall care they put into their business and patron is enough to make we want to shop here everyday, regardless of product.   They can sometimes get a little pushy with the samosas, but they ARE fan-freaking-tastic, if you get talked into one just go with it, you won't be disappointed.

{"text":"I keep coming back time and time again!! I try and eat low carb so I usually get the donair combo salad and oh my gooooosh! So filling and tasty. I'm super picky with my shawarma meat too I hate fat and their chicken is perfect and no fat whatsoever. They also have a selection of imported pops which is awesome. Come here! Staff is also super friendly and it always looks like a fun environment when I'm there."}
{"text":"Came here just to get a donair and boy was I impressed. Best donair in Calgary. Highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I had awful food poisoning from this here a couple of weeks ago. Seano W mentions it in his review below. It's a shame because I did enjoy this place before that! It just doesn't have the same appeal anymore."}
{"text":"Its like a small grocery shop with shawrma section on the side. They give huge portion of meat for their shwarmas. Their small is medium elsewhere. Good shwarma . Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"It's great to see a local business thrive over the years and best of all, retain quality and value of the food. The only thing I miss about going to Jimmy's is seeing Jimmy and hearing his crazy banter. Jimmy's started out as a single location and now has branched out into 2. The original store has been fixed up a bit to allow for seating upstairs. The store started out as a little convenience store. Food is now the main ticket item; although a small selection of mediterranean staples and sauces as well as spices can be found on the shelves. I don't think you can beat Jimmy's for value when it comes to shawarmas and donairs. It's chicken or ground beef/lamb compressed into a roast-like shape and slow cooked on a vertical electric broiler that rotates the meat as it cooks, sliced, and put on a pita with vegetables and sauce. I usually go for the chicken shawarma as I prefer the taste of the chicken at this place. Today I couldn't make up my mind so I went with the combo. My photo shows what you get and that was half way through my meal and each mouthful was chock-full of meat and veggies. They make it as you like it with all the fixin's. One of the things I like is that when you ask for spicy they make it that way. Too often I ask for spicy, and get a whimpy row of banana peppers or a thin strip of hot sauce, but here they understand what spicy means and check with you to make sure that they did it right. A small is around $8.50 and is very filling. It's at least 5 napkins to get you through a shawarma. It's just a bit messy to eat but enjoy! There is a display case with a small selection of salads such as greek and tabouleh, jamaican patties, meat pies, some cheese, samosas and baklavas and other delicious stuff. Service is quick and efficient. There is limited street parking. Most people come for take-out; if you wish you can sit outside or upstairs. It's a small place so seating is limited."}
{"text":"I had the small chicken shawarma.  The presentation was great and the portion size of meat was very generous! The small is like a large for me so I saved the remaining half for later. The shawarma was flavorful. They also sell ethnic food so I got a chicken samosa, haloumi cheese and ayran yogurt drink. The establishment is well maintained and the staff are very friendly!"}
{"text":"I forgot about this place. Epic! The large shawarma was the size of my head. Hand filled olives and great personable service. I love this place! (Although my waistline does not) :)"}
{"text":"was in yesterday for the fresh falafels.  They are aaamazing.  When I'm in a hurry, sure I'll take the pre made ones.  But I find I just had to wait for the fresh falafels.  As she broke them open, they were steaming with goodness, and she loaded the pita with amazing fresh vegetables and a little spicy peppers(perfection), it was a little hot, but not a burn where you can't taste anything, \"just right\".   This is the best food of the gods, and its right here in calgary.  Best falafel in calgary.  PitaPit/extremepita, all the other places, nothing compared to this."}
{"text":"I request my husband takes me here every time We are in Calgary, their Chicken Shawarma is the best!  It is a very welcoming family run business I always enjoy stopping at.  Everyone is friendly and the service is great, there are a lot of interesting spices and food stuffs you can look at purchase while waiting for your food."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful place.   We ordered small and they are HUGE, FULL OF MEAT.  OMG.   Meat coma...  l we r gonna order a large one for two ppl next time lol  the guy Named Kyle let us try both chicken and beef before we ordered.  We both liked chicken, and the sauce is amazing."}
{"text":"I love Jimmy's! Hands down the best shwarma/donair place in Calgary! Soooo good. I have random cravings for it all the time. My only complaint is that I wish they were opened till a bit later - I think they close at 9:30pm, at least on weekdays.  As previous reviews state, the portions are huge. I usually get a medium or large and split it half/half with my sister or my boyfriend, and we are always more than satisfied by how full we are. If you are eating one by yourself, I would recommend a small size unless you want to explode. The staff are super friendly - just ask them to cut it in half if you are sharing. They always make jokes and are so cheerful. One time I saw a little boy at the place with his father and he started crying because he couldn't get a chocolate bar - one of the employees (I think he is one of the owners because he is always there) made the little boy promise him that he would brush his teeth and gave him a free chocolate bar! Such good customer service.   I also love their baklava. I think the chocolate pistacchio one is amazing. Super sweet but not in an overwhelming way, like some I've tried at other places.  There is parking available on the street. There are also some tables and chairs outside in front, nice to be able to eat outside when it's sunny outside. Unfortunately there are no seating inside on the first floor. I think I've seen a sign for ice cream upstairs but I've never been so I'm not sure what's up there.  Oh also. It is extremely messy to eat so I would not recommend going here on a date.... Unless you don't mind having food all over your face and dripping! :P"}
{"text":"Was out walking with my friend, her and her dog, around River Park. After her dog had its fill of someone's picnic dinner, she suggested we go grab a bite to eat ourselves.  She happens to be Calgary's pre-eminent Donair expert and she mentioned that she knew of a place not too far that was one of her faves.  I eat anything. I agreed. Besides, I don't get to see this friend very often, and she's about as awesome as they come, so any extra time in her company is time well-spent. She could have suggested we go eat dirt, and I would have agreed.  So to this little middle eastern market/deli did we go. I'm not judging the ambience here. It's a little corner store/deli. You only rate a place on ambience if it's the type of place where you'd expect some ambience. Thus this review is only concerning the donairs (and the little desserts we ate afterwards.)  As far as donairs go, these were pretty good. Not sure if it distinguished itself from other pretty good donairs I've had elsewhere. Basically a pita, some tasty donair meat, some veggies, and tzatziki sauce. So, about 3.5 stars for the donair, and 0.5 stars for Jimmy and the stories about the place from my friend. Jimmy's has a bit of history behind it.  The desserts were good. We had something called a honey finger, if I recall, though it looked more like a thumb. It was tasty and not overly sweet.  I would not drive out of my way to eat here, but if I was in the area, sure, definitely would return.  My friend has promised to introduce me to every other donair eatery in Calgary. So beware more reviews."}
{"text":"Close to work and so yummy this is a well frequented stop for my office.     Jimmy is hilarious - he's the lebanese cowboy.  The decor is a bit strange.  The food is very good.  The prices are right. The lines at lunch can be VERY long.  Don't wear your best because it can be a messy eat.    Parking can be hard to find,  if you park in a non-1 hour zone you will likely get ticketed (they are patrolled a lot) and there is only places to eat outside in the summer which is a bit disappointing.    That's about it - a simple review for a simple joint."}
{"text":"Good effort . Big wraps."}
{"text":"I had this crazy craving for falafel. I asked around and one friend told me about this place. It's not hard to find (just off 16th ave). It's kinda different inside. Cramped, cluttered, but smells good. I got a couple spanakopita (good but I didn't taste any feta) I got one chicken samosa (great flavor but my first bite was all chicken cartilage) and lastly I got a medium falafel pita. It's HUGE! I couldn't eat it all. Lots of fresh ingredients. Pretty salty. If I came back I'd prob go for a meat pita instead. But it did fulfill my falafel craving.  No credit only debit and cash. Wasn't exceptionally speedy service but friendly. Lots of hookah pipes for sale if you're interested LOL!"}
{"text":"The Samosas are perfection and the Donairs are something I find an excuse to get to that part of town for.   Besides the great fast food, the service is always with a smile and good humor and the deli options are about as fresh and tasty as you could expect if you're at the home of a Middle Eastern friend with a mother who makes everything with handed down recipes and love.  The quality of food really makes this a MUST EXPERIENCE experience in Calgary.   The food and service is 5 stars, but the lack of parking, tables and no credit cards accepted make the experience just under the top rating."}
{"text":"Solid place for a chicken shawarma and Jimmy himself is quite the personality!    Warning: come with an appetite. The portions are huge.  A small will leave an average person feeling quite full (although hubby gets a large - I don't know how he does it!).    In addition to the copious amounts of meat, the shawarmas are filled with lots of veggies, including lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles and banana peppers.  Also, there's garlic sauce and hot sauce if you're into that.  It can get really messy as they are VERY generous with the amount of sauce they put in the shawarma (you'll need lots of napkins) and the lineups can get really long.    They also have various salads, olives, samosas and baklavas for your eating pleasure."}
{"text":"It's a hot afternoon; even the streets are sweating... you walk up the steel grated steps and open the door...  Now, the heat washes past you, like the waves on desert highways, and you can't help but feel transported to a place that knows what real heat, is all about.   Arroma and music blasts you in the face, like that same desert's wind and enter you must... upon this new threshold.  Just so you know... at Jimmy's, you gotta yell... cuz the music is so bleeding loud... and, it's nice to yell sometimes... to yell, without anger... just to be heard...  I'll leave the interior description to you...   Jimmy's is a true eastern Mediteranean (I learned to spell that in grade 6, forgive me) shop, all the wares that one might expect, and all the smells that give the glands reasons to seep.  Hmm, I'm wondering if this review is turning into something more... sorry,   Jimmy's is the best place to get flat breads filled with glorious beef, chicken and falafel fillings. They also sell houka pucks, weird and wonderful canned goods from the world-wide and they are some of the friendliest people you will meet.   My only crit.. is the upstairs eating chamber... don't go there, go outside and feast on the amply packed \"I can't eat another bite\" Shawarma and donair and falafel.  Cheers, Ted  P.S. no spell check... sue me."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite take-out food in Calgary, very friendly people and service is outstanding. I go quite often, I always have the beef donair. I highly recommend it, quite often I will drive 20 minutes or more out of my way just to eat here."}
{"text":"Best Lebanese in Calgary!! I've been to many and while some are good, none are as good as Jimmy's."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! This is the only place i get donairs because everywhere else just doesn't compare. The meat is really good, the sauce is delicious, the bread is fresh and the veggies are good too. Jimmy's donairs are also pretty big so it's not a rip off. I also think that the people who work at Jimmy's are very friendly and they initiate conversation. I have gone there a few times and i will continue to there!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic and the people are so friendly. Food is very fresh tasting and high-quality. The only thing is, make sure you're following your food down the line if you're celiac. Husband accidentally consumed tabouleh with couscous after we requested that his meal be gluten-free."}
{"text":"Best donair ever!! So full and delicious. Plus the staff there are so friendly! An awesome little local spot."}
{"text":"I walked in there for the second time in the past 5 years, and I guess I'll try to avoid this place in future. I don't know much about shawarmas and they wouldn't even bother saying what the choices are that you can put in your wrap. I absolutely like the sweet sauce. I've had shawarmas in downtown places and they tasted much better. Sidewise A&A is better though. Overall I guess I kinda felt disrespected. Maybe they just didn't like me, but that didn't seem right. I didn't really do anything to deserve that.... Go ahead and try it yourself :)"}
{"text":"I was craving shawarma europe-style, and I'd been out of the city for so long. My friend dragged me out to Jimmy's, and I had a few good memories but nothing really clear. I balked a bit at the prices - $7.50 for a small shawarma?! And then I SAW the small shawarma, and I'm not sure whose lexicon they're using, because that thing was MASSIVE. You really are getting a good deal. The large makes its own gravity.   These huge portions are also amazingly delicious. Juicy, lightly seasoned meat, fresh veggies, and they accommodate your weird requests without a fuss.   I love the lore that goes with this place. I've only been served by Jimmy a few times, but he is very much a character. The staff are great in their own right, cracking jokes and having fun. The baklava is decent, and so is the selection of lebanese basics. Run-of-the-mill corner store basics will cost a pretty penny.  But those Shawarma are like biting into heaven. You never want to stop. Best in Calgary, hands down."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Thank you Yelp for helping us to find this little gem.  Everything we ate --grape leaves, hummus, shwarma- all amazing! The food is made with love and care.  I wish I lived in Calgary because this would definitely be a regular spot."}
{"text":"Bought milk that had gone sour and bought a chocolate bar. Took the chocolate bar home and noticed it was completely green with mould right before I was about to bite into it. Never returning after that experience. Baffling."}
{"text":"If you know the difference between shwarma and Shish tauk you need to go to A & A. YUM!!!  Anything bigger than a small and you need two hands and a lot of napkins!!"}
{"text":"Huge donairs good flavour and good price. Shawarma is second best in town, the best is just down the hill..."}
{"text":"Jimmy's is not far from my kids school and I've driven past it many times.  Curiosity got the better of me one day and I stopped in for lunch after dropping my boy at school.  Parking was a challenge to say the least but determination prevailed.  It was about mid week and there were about a dozen people wandering about the small store inside.  So much to look at and take in...I love this kind of place...it alludes character!  The deli counter seems to stretch on for miles filled with all kinds of delicious bites.  After reading some of the reviews I knew I had to have the small chicken shawarama.  And I'm glad I picked the small because it was massive!  I couldn't finish it all even though I tried.  A gooey, drippy mess that was extremely tasty.  While I didn't see the man known as Jimmy....the staff were so friendly and the lady at the register beyond awesome....maybe Jimmy's wife?!  She was engaging, chatty and jokes were a flyin (at my expense of course over a mix up on my name)!!  As I picked up my order I couldn't help but make a mental note over the abundance of delicious items available.  Everything from Jamaican Patties, Samosas, Falafel, Salads, Pitas, Meat Pies...it just goes on and on.  Even if you do not enjoy shawaramas there is something for everyone here.    All hail Jimmy's. We will be back."}
{"text":"I spent most of my life in Halifax, Nova Scotia.  Home of some of Canada's historical land marks, some of the country's premiere universities, the most number of pubs and tims hortons per capita, and of course DONAIRS!  Over the years I have come to become a bit of a donair aficionado, whether ordering in with friends during a game, or a drunken stumble to another famous Halifax landmark, Pizza Corner.  I have tried several donair places after moving to Alberta, but none came even close to what I have come to know and love.  I was telling this to a friend I went to school with at SAIT after he told me about \"the best donair place he had ever been to!\" just a couple blocks from the school.  I went, not expecting much, until I walked into Jimmy's A&A.    First look from the outside, you think it's a corner store.  Far from it.  Walking in we were greeted with the smell of mediterranean spices and the familiar smell of donair sweet sauce.  On a side note Alberta, get rid of the garlic sauce!  That is not what you put on donair!  Has to be sweet sauce.  But I digress.  Jimmy's had a large selection from donair, shawarma, meat pies, salads, a large selection of olives and pastries.  I ordered a donair with sweet sauce, tomatoes and banana peppers, my \"go to\" order, and a small piece of baklava.  One thing that I notice in Alberta, is the way you sauce the donair.  A squirt bottle with sauce that is spread over the meat, like how you get at subway.  WRONG!  lol..  the meat should be tossed in the sweet sauce before being put into the pita.    Seeing the sauce being squirted on the meat left me thinking here we go again, another attempt at donair.  Well that was the only strike!  I got into the donair and I have to say that it is up there... the best ever? no, but close.  The seasoning of the meat elevated the donair beyond my expectations.  Although applied incorrectly, the sauce was delicious.  And it was a hefty helping of a meal!  Do not order anything bigger than a medium if you don't want to be taking left overs home with you.  The baklava was also very good.  A nice small piece was a welcome treat after the savouriness of the football size donair.    I have been back to Jimmy's twice through school, and already look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This is a solid place for Lebanese food. Everyone is super friendly here.  This is one of my favourite places in the city for a donair or a chicken platter.  The portion sizes are huge.  They are always busy and it's a great spot for a quick bite.  It can get messy so make sure you have lots of napkins if you're getting one of the wraps."}
{"text":"Just went today and got the large chicken swarma to share with my husband!  Fresh cooked spiced chicken so tender and tasty!  Of course I also got 6 fresh baked baklava and also 2 delicious large samosas for supper later! A line up formed behind me and was quite busy for lunch.  The lady at the till was very friendly and efficient serving the customers. Soooooo good and worth coming here for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm updating and upgrading my review.  I must have gone on an off day. I've since been back a couple of times. Staff is super nice and quick.  And the sandwiches are really good.  While still not the best Shwarma in the city - it's now definitely up there for me, and I don't mind popping in for a quick sandwich on the run.  Good quality meat, good portion size and the home made sauce is actually REALLY tasty! Although - be aware, it's VERY garlicy! Garlic-y good!"}
{"text":"Why didn't anyone tell me about this earlier? Easily the biggest and best Chicken Shawarma I have ever had. Picked up the beef Donair for my wife and she had the same to say about it."}
{"text":"Okay woah.    Jimmy's A & A is a true hidden gem located on the corner of  20th Avenue in the NW, sure it may look ghetto but its ghetto good!!  Its a small place with a ton of food.    Whenever I go, I always order a shawarma which is a Arab sandwich-like wrap.  They make the BEST CHICKEN SHAWARMAS in all of Calgary.  They're truly amazing.  Sometimes they can be out of the chicken or beef so you would have to wait a couple minutes, but its definitley worth the wait! Fresh chicken or beef? Yes please!!  Just like everyone else said, the SMALL is huge! (~$9) They stuff the wrap with the meat and have this amazing garlic sauce, lettuce, pickles, onions and tomatoes (if you want all of the toppings) and you can get it spicy or not.  The spice is just some hot chili sauce they squeeze on.  But the wrap itself has SO MUCH FLAVOR! Not only can you taste it, but you can actually see the spices on the meat.  Its mouth watering.  There is a very strong garlic taste but I love garlic! So I dont mind..  They do have a big selection of food, from salads to shawarmas to samosas to baklava!  I ordered 3 random pieces of baklava for after and they were nice and flaky.  They seem really oily (which they are) but they're delicious!  Ps. If you order a shawarma, be sure NOT to take the shawarma completely out because it can get very messy...the paper bag and wax is like a support system for the wrap. Keep it in or it'll all fall out! :)  Pps. If you haven't been there, I suggest you to go ASAP!!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much. I almost walked away when I first came here, but be not deceived! The food is delicious. Huge portions! Super authentic! The staff is really nice and chill as well. It's not uncommon for them to give you something for free."}
{"text":"They have large portions for a decent price. Try the mixed beef and chicken, it's deadly. Make sure you get extra napkins cause they are messy! Service is very friendly."}
{"text":"The food was excellent (chicken shawarma and veggie samosa) and Jimmy was warm and welcoming. Will surely eat here again."}
{"text":"Excellent Chicken Shwarma!   I've only been there once but I need to go back soon!  Huge portions and a decent price.  Also had one of their baklava's, they have numerous kinds, and it was also very tasty.  No complains here!"}
{"text":"There should be a live feed to watch all the counter banter especially if Jimmy is slinging words. The portions are huge so you better be hungry to take down a large. I like the salad, everything in a shawarma mixed up so the flavours get busy together.  I used to bounce back and forth between chicken shawarma and donairs but now I just go for the combo. Their garlic sauce is second to none.  The baklava is always fresh because they have lots of turn over, so you might as well round out your meal."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The food is so good it has ruined donairs and shwarmas for me at any other place around. I ordered a donair by my house and found myself laughing at the tiny size of it. If Jimmys Donair had a baby that would have been it. Jimmys donairs and shwarma's you need to hands to eat and 2 handfuls of napkins. I foolishly ordered an extra large donair on my first visit. It could have fed me and 2 of my kids!! Love this place"}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot of donairs in Calgary but nobody does it quite like Jimmy. They are now (as of writing of this review) running two locations in town, this is the original and a newer one in Beltline south of Central Memorial Park.   Don't hesitate to visit. A true Middle Eastern deli."}
{"text":"Best shawarmas I have ever had! The price is good. And they load the pita up with lots of meat!! Huge portions. Love the spices they use, that what makes it so unique. The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Best donair place in the city.  Their donair sauce tastes great.  Their meat is flavourful.  Staff is friendly.  Service is quick.  No place to eat except for tables outside but hey, it's a deli.  Oh yeah, their portions are huge!  Order one size down from what you regularly order elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food is still tasty and it is a fair price. I wish the prep folks would actually follow through with the hot sauce when you ask for it.    I really miss seeing Jimmy and the family. They were always nice to chat with. Not keen on the current guy at the till, he creeps out my wife and is nowhere as charming as Jimmy.  The food is worth the trip but new guy should turn down the act."}
{"text":"This is some of the best shawarma in Calgary!  It is flavorful and so delicious.  Just walking up to the front door makes my mouth water.  If I ever have a craving for some middle eastern food this is one of the first places that I think of.  Don't think... just go right now!"}
{"text":"Being a student I am a fan of quick delicious food. Jimmy's has always been my go to place for donairs and shwarmas because of it's closeness to the u of c. The food is tasty, unfortunately the price is a tad bit expensive for a university student. I also find the portions a bit big, but that could just be me. Be sure to get your wrap \"stuffed\" (made inside the pita, not on it) so you don't have the sauces all over your pants."}
{"text":"Don't bring a date here if you expect it to get past the meal; I had garlic on my breath for three days.  The chicken shawarma was incredible.  Although it seems minor, the pickles were what made it for me--crunchy and very delicious.  I probably could have done with a little less sauce, but we took it to go and couldn't eat for 20 minutes, so perhaps that was the problem.  Like Cheryl said, don't bother with a large.  I was very hungry and a medium was more than enough.  They have a bunch of unique foods and beverages available; the half of the store \"behind you\" while you're standing at the deli is like a convenience store.  The guy at the till was quite funny, and was able to manage the very long line extremely well.  I would definitely go here again, and if the food is as good as last time, I'll bump it to five stars."}
{"text":"Great selection of desserts and of course their shwarmas are killer. I've been coming here for years and I still don't have a clue how people can finish a large, let alone an extra large. Lots of food for the price."}
{"text":"Authentic  Family owned restaurant .  Best shawarma in the city. Jimmy and his family offer visitors an inviting environment. I dare you to mention Jimmy's A & A foods at the next gathering your at and I can guarantee someone will agree that this is the best place to satisfy your donair cravings. If the Avengers where real and in Calgary this is where they would eat their post victory shawarma.   Feel free to check out a mini-documentary featuring Jimmy and his restaurant: http://youtu.be/ilqnm-KV58E"}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian can be challenging when dining out. Jimmy's was very up for trying one of my strange requests.  A veggie samosa diced up into a wrap! Too good."}
{"text":"It's ok. Lots of toppings on the lamb schwarma.  They are huge. It was very busy and we waited a good twenty five minutes for two schwarmas. The garlic sauce is strong. It seems like they know what they are doing. A well oiled assembly line. It is quite messy to consume. It would be nice if it had a plastic bag to hold the wrap like some other places. Also, the meat has a good taste; a quick pan fry on it would be nice.  Some places do this and it makes all the difference.  It kind of just tastes like seasoned boiled meat at this point."}
{"text":"Picture Homer Simpson when he sees something really delicious that he wants to eat.  His eyes close a bit, his mouth waters profusely, and he makes that mouthwatering gargling sound.  Do you have the image in your head?  Well, that's probably me exactly when I think about eating at Jimmy's!  It's so delicious that whenever I think about it, I have an instant craving!  The amount of food you get for the price is unbelievable!  The donairs and shawarmas are so big I struggle to finish one.  Even when I'm stuffed to the brim, I can't bring myself to throw any away, so I always make myself sick by force feeding the remaining wrap into my mouth.  I wouldn't for one second dream of wasting a Jimmy donair.  I know that everyone who goes here will all be saying the same thing: it's so delicious and marvelous that nothing else will ever be satisfying again!  The first time I went in here I had no clue what I was doing or what I wanted to eat.  Lucky for me, Jimmy was behind the counter serving people and he pointed me in the right direction of something yummy.  He was super friendly and extremely helpful.  Don't tell Jimmy but I kind of have a little crush on him.  Maybe that's why I keep going back.  Nah, it's because of how fantastic the food is.  Besides the donairs and shawarmas, they also have a bunch of little desserts you can buy.  There is a whole display of baklava and other yummy looking treats.  Along with the food, Jimmy's is also a great place to go if you want to buy some shisha or hookah pipes.  They have a large assortment of different sizes and shapes, and all the flavours that you can imagine smoking.  I seriously love Jimmy's so much.  I miss the days when a friend used to live behind the store and we ate there almost everyday.  Now I have to go a little out of my way to get there, but it's totally worth it every time.  I love Jimmy's so much and I'm positive that everyone who goes there loves it too.  It's just one of those awesome finds that everyone in the world should know about.  *insert Homer Simpson drooling here*"}
{"text":"jimmy's has the best chicken shawarma, bar none!   you can go for larger, but i usually just go for the small size and even then i am always stuffed!  very generous portions and sooooo good.  super great deal and the staff are always very warm and friendly.  if you talk to any of the family that owns jimmy's, especially 'mama', they will talk and treat you like family."}
{"text":"We have been visiting Jimmy's for the last 5 years and never ever have been disappointed with the flavorful chicken shawarma. They load it with meat and the garlic sauce is best. The staff always seems to be very happy serving and treat everyone well and at times are extremely funny! If you ever host parties, order the food from Jimmy's, they give you tons of food for the price you pay for. They are also allergy friendly as my kids have allergies to tree nuts, just mention to the staff. They used to have a sit down upstairs which has been removed recently. I wish they open up especially in winters so people can sit down and eat. In the summer, they have sitting place outside."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a weekday and there was a long line-up (like 13 people ahead of me). I thought I'd be there for 30 minutes, but was only waiting for about 15 minutes. This place has nailed down the assembly line!!! Super efficient!  And the donairs are yummmmmy! HUGE...stuffed full of meat and all the other goodness.   I will return."}
{"text":"Wow!  I can't believe that this tiny little place can hold so much food and fresh items!    We ordered the Falafel, the Beef Donair and the Chicken Shawarma pita sandwiches.  They were all Mediums and they were huge!  One pita sandwich with tons of stuff on them. I liked the Falafel one the best - loads of flavour!    We also ordered a couple of the Stuffed Grape Leaves and the Tabouli Salad - quite good!  The Tabouli salad was very fresh and lemony.  Paid almost $35 for 3 people - pretty good price.   Other food items to note - olives, samosas, caribbean patties, empanadas, cheese (like feta, halloum), sweet Mediterranean desserts.  FYI - cash and debit only."}
{"text":"Was introduced to this place for the first time today and can say that I will definitely be going back! It doesn't look like much from the outside but its a hidden gem!  My boyfriend and I ordered the Large chicken Shwarma to share and it was more than enough for 2 people. We were both stuffed. Everything about this meal was fantastic. Best Shawarma I have ever had and the price is excellent.  I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Overly-priced with extra hidden charges, mediocre taste, and simply over-rated! Why the heck would they charge extra for hummus (among other ingredients), a common ingredient in Shawarma wraps?! Moreover, the owner, who rings in your order, just punches away without informing you of charges, nor are the charges displayed on the cash register, nor do you get a receipt.   Save your money and get two wraps at any Villa Medina in Calgary for the same price as one wrap at Jimmy's, plus add any extra ingredient you desire for free, making for a much more delicious meal! And you'll probably dine at a much nicer place than the dive Jimmy's is. For all that matter, I honestly think any Shawarma/Donair place would be better than Jimmy's in taste, quality, and value for your money."}
{"text":"It is true - this place is a gem.  Their halal food is fresh, smoky, well seasoned, and goes well with their fresh baked pitas.  I had mine with tabuli salad.  I had falafal as well and very crispy and rich in flavor.  I wish I had the extra stomach to try baklava and other little eats.  I think the chicken sharma is a safe bet but would recommend falafal as well.  There is a small dining area upstairs which I thought was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Best chicken shawarama in the city.    Nowhere to eat it, and they are quite messy and will leave your breath garlic-y all day but they are so tasty it is sometimes worth it.  The staff are all very friendly and outgoing and its a fast service.  Its pretty pricey but the portions are very large."}
{"text":"Over rated..it's like the Tim Hortons of Donairs...the sheep line up. They are open 7 days a week....can't take one day off for family I guess. The owner is an arrogant man and the other man who works at the till is just plain rude. Over priced and over rated!"}
