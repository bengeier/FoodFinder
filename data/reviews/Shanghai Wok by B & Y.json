{"text":"I have been in on a few occasions for carryout. Great lunch specials for only $5. I really love their Lomein & their General Tso's chicken. The chicken is crispy & hot. Sauce is delicious. They have been very friendly & they are willing to give me soup or soda instead of an egg roll. I also ask for lo mein instead of rice for a small upcharge. The only downsides are: 1) I don't care for their wonton soup. 2) The inside doesn't look nice to eat in so it's really mainly a carryout place."}
{"text":"Man, first dead flies in my beef n'  broccoli now bones in my general tso's that found their sharp broken ends in the roof of my mouth. Tastes great, however, check your food here thoroughly."}
{"text":"I won't go back. Food was, at best, mediocre in flavor and texture. If I ate the shrimp blindfolded I wouldn't have been able to tell you it was shrimp. This place used to have great Chinese food but apparently not any more."}
{"text":"Good spot for a quick dinner. Food is your typical fast food style Chinese but it is of good quality and this is my go to. Prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese place in the area. In fact, I drive past two other closer Chinese places to pick up food there. Delicious dinners include fried rice, egg roll and fortune cookie for 7.99. We always get Wonton soup, too."}
{"text":"The only reason that this restaurant is getting one start is because it goes no lower. After a long drive, we decided to order Chinese. They didn't take half of our order over the phone. Asked for a tip and then were irritated with the tip given. Then argued that we didn't order the other half of our meal when we called them back. RUDE!!!!! Do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"We decided to try Shanghai Wok and I'm glad we did. I got tofu and mixed vegetables and the sauce was really good. My son had chicken fried rice and said it was good too. I'll definitely go back and if the food is this good Next time I'll make it my \"go-to\" Chinese place in Nordonia"}
{"text":"Food tasted great! Ordered over the phone and food was ready within 15 minutes! Currently they are running a discount which was nice as well. Nice atmosphere inside when I picked up my order, they also offer delivery! Only a $10 minimum."}
