{"text":"The cabbage was tasty. The greens were canned, so if you're seeking to reconnect with your grandma's greens, you may want to skip these. Overall, I found my stew chicken plate a little salty, so hypertension patients beware."}
{"text":"Omg can you say D-lish this is the best caribbean food I have had in charlotte and I'm born & raised here so I no the city well! I love caribbean food and I've been to a couple caribbean spots and none like this place the food is excellent the resturant is clean, neat and the service is great there not lacking a thing! My search is over I pledge to not eat at another caribbean restaurant again! I highly recommend any and everyone to the pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I have found good Jamaican food in Charlotte! We went on a Sunday and the food and atmosphere were awesome. I had a very generous portion of Jerk Chicken, rice and peas and collard greens. I wanted more! The food was fresh and just the right amount of spice. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I am a lover of jamaican food. Well, I love everything Jamaican, I can't help it. So I found my way to this lovely spot in the Kohl's plaza tucked away nicely in the far corner ( Please get some signage out front!).   The interior was nice and clean, it was very \"new\" looking but only had a score of 95....hmm. In all actuality, the food was THEE best tasting Jamaican food in Charlotte as far as I'm concerned.  But when I tell you...these restauranteurs need to take a lesson on plating portions. I am sorry, I can't pay $9.00 for your offerings.  One can get much more food in a value meal...Howard's pictures are exactly what you are going to get.  You see the plate with the Oxtail on it?  Well, you are gonna pay close to $12.00 for that. Rice, cheap! Cabbage, cheap! Plantains, cheap! Just doesn't seem right...  Most would say Jamaican dishes require more seasoning and preparation than other ethnic foods.  Well, so does Indian... and for $12.00 I can eat all that want at ANY Indian buffet. Don't be afraid to feed the people.  Do that and they will come back. There is another restaurant I have yelp'd in the past that has this down to science and on any given day I can sit there for an hour and watch 20-30 people come in and out... (((Do you hear me?))) 20-30!!! I may return in the future but certainly this will not be a  go-to spot on my list. Until then, I will take my monies elswhere."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype Tropical Goodies on Beatties Ford is wayyyyyyyy better. I got brown stewed chicken which was dry with macaroni n cheese that tasted like just noodles with no cheese. My friend got oxtail that weren't that good either and a jamaican patty with hardly any meat in it. We won't be back"}
{"text":"Didn't like my particular meal! I had the Jerk Chicken with Rice/Beans & Cabbage. I have had better Jerk Chicken @ the Caribbean Hut. To me it just doesn't seem as if the chicken was seasoned well, it seemed kind of bland. I had to put some salt/pepper & hot sauce on it just to make it somewhat better. Also the young lady that was helping us seems to have had a real bad attitude. Upon arrival we stated that it was our first time there and she wasn't welcoming @ all. Instead of her recommending some things she just pretty much hurried us along. My fiance asked for a sample of the curry sauce.....just a small sample (teaspoon if that much) well she said \"NO\" she couldn't do it. If her attitude had not been so bad I would've considered coming back to try something else but I highly doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"All I wanted was a beef patty and coco bread. Beef patty a bit over cooked and coco bread wasn't soft .. first and last visit."}
{"text":"I came to Charlotte looking for Caribbean food before my flight and what a DELIGHT!!!! The food was awesome and the service was great. If you are looking for good OXTAILS... This is your place."}
{"text":"Walked in during lunch hour rush on Thursday and my order was quickly taken. I had curry chicken with cabbage and rice. Also got beef patties to go.  Everything was delicious. The man who took my order was very quick!!!  Second time here. Came in Friday. The lunch specials are not on Friday. A lady took my order along with 3 other people. She was sooooooo slow 2 customers who came in after us left without placing an order.  I don't know why she would put the rice in the container close it then put the cabbage close it up then put the curry chicken close it up then ring me up and take my money and go to the next customer. She saw the 4 of us come in together to make it quicker. She should have gotten out 4 to go boxed and layed then open and put the food in all at one time the ring it up at the register last or ring up everyone first and then go make everyone food. I literally spent my 1 hour lunch in line there with her making 4 plates. She was young and seems intimated I'm not sure why because we were all nice to here. I wish she had gone Jb the back to ask for help.  Next time call in your lunch order to save time.  Food is good!!!!! 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! This was my first time trying them out. The service was subpar and the food was bland. I got the curry chicken which lacked flavor, the rice was undercooked(crunchy), and the collard greens were flavorless. My friend got the Jerk chicken and her food mirrored my disappointment and description. Lastly, the portions are way too small for the price. I really doubt that I'll ever return."}
{"text":"Had a yummy (and filling!) lunch here with a friend recently.  I admit that I'm not the biggest fan of Jamaican food so I got my staple, jerk chicken ( yes I'm a wuss when it comes to trying new things) with rice and beans, and plantain.  My friend had curried chicken, plantain, and cabbage.   Generous portions and everything was good. A little spicy but it's what I expected. The only thing that was \"off\" was the bread. It didn't taste like the coco bread I'm used to eating at the Jamaican places I've gone to back home.  No big deal. Everything else was great.  If I'm in the area again with a taste for Jamaican food, I'll definitely eat here."}
{"text":"Meh! The food is real bland!!!!! Cabbage taste like they saut√©ed a cabbage with no seasoning not even salt. The rice a peas are dry. On the upside the place is very clean and pretty empty so you can get your food quick. Best thing on menu are the patties that are not made in house."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant yesterday because I was carving some Jamaican Food so I heard this spot was pretty good and it actually was Kiara did a good job in helping me I'm very happy and definitely will return."}
{"text":"I went to this Jamaican restaurant because I love Oxtails.  The flavor was very tasty but I paid $14 for a plate of fat!!  There was barley any meat at all.  If you go there to eat Oxtails make sure they are meaty!!"}
{"text":"Normally this place is good. But today the food was horrible. The curry chicken was old. I think it was left overs. The gravey for the chicken was old and lumpy. The white rice was so hard it felt like I was chewing rocks. The  cabbage was also old I had to ask if they had a batch that was fresh. She gave me more cabbage but it was not fresh. It appeared that the food was left overs from Sunday. If I go back it will be about 6+ months. The only good thing was the sanitation score was 97."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken patty was one of the best I've had here. I wanted to turn around and get another one! The cabbage, was the worst I've had ever. It smelled and had a weird taste. I ended up tossing it (wasted $3.25). The establishment itself was quiet and clean. The employee that assisted me was pleasant. I just really hate that the cabbage was such a disappointment, especially because of the price and my specific desire for Caribbean cabbage."}
