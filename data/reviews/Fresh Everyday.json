{"text":"Food is on the salty side. Meat was flavourful but chewy. Soup tasted like seaweed water. Rice overcooked. I get it's a more take out place so I was not  bothered by the restaurant itself (small, disposable chopsticks and plastic spoon). But the food itself was mediocre. I gave it two rather than one star because it claims no msg and does taste like home cooked food by a normal Chinese person. We ordered ??? combo, ?????? combo, small ???? and it's about $10 per combo."}
{"text":"We found this gem one day after doing some shopping at T&T, and boy what a find.

Not only was the owner, 'you lu' really nice, the waitress are all really nice and ready to suggest the recommendation of the day (based on what's fresh, and not what's leftover like some other resutrants).

The first time we were here, we tried the ???? (kung Lao chicken), the ???? (pork belly on shredded potatos), and ???? (spicy broth boiled pork) and all I can say is they knock it all out of the park. The kung Lao chicken had the perfect balance between spicy and sweet and the crispy peanuts just added another layer of texture to the dish. The pork belly was cut very thin and same with the potatoes so each piece absorbed all the delicious flavor of the sauce. 

Another thing I love about the place is that they always have off the menu secret items. One of our favorite secret menu items is the pork shoulder. They stew it  for a whole 24 hour before serving to you, but the only downside is that you have to order it 24 hours in advance so they have time to prepare it.

All in all this place has become our new go to destination when we are too lazy to cook and they never fail to impress each time. This place is also very economical because portions are sure to fill you up, and at only around 10 Bucks per lunch set."}
{"text":"There are so many places to eat around this plaza and my family usually likes to choose one and stick to it every time we come, but today I'm glad we discovered a new favorite!

Fresh Everyday serves authentic szechuan-style food. Their menu ranges from a spice rating of no chili peppers to two chili peppers. I have never eaten at a szechuan restaurant before because I get intimidated by their deadly hot-looking food soaking in intense red chili sauce. However, today we realized this is a false impression of their food. We ordered the chongqing noodles (one chili pepper), noodles with minced beef sauce (one chili pepper) and poached sliced pork in hot chili oil (two chili pepper). The food was spicy, but the spice was never overbearing to the point where it masked other flavors; there was always an interesting and complex savoriness in each dish. I highly recommend this place for those who have never experienced the depth of flavors in szechuan foods!"}
{"text":"My friend discovered this place during a T&T run next door. He recommended it me and I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is quite tiny (very narrow but the unit stretches really far back). Some of my friends can't eat really spicy foods so they were already panicking before the meal began. 

We got fish, two types of pork belly, beef, two types of chicken, pickled cabbage and some mapo tofu (of course - can't have szechuan food without having mapo tofu). All of the dishes were really tasty and flavorful and thankfully for my friends, not too spicy either. The fish was probably the most spicy out of all the dishes. The pork belly with preserved veggie was perhaps a lil bit on the saltier side but still tasty nonetheless. 

The waitress was very friendly and spoke fluent mandarin and english as well. Price was really decent for the amount of food. Around $22/head and we had 5 ppl."}
{"text":"Hip, minimalistic and clean interior with great service. Although the dishes are on the pricy side (ranging from 9-11 bucks) - the taste is more authentic than most Chinese restaurants. Very much enjoyed the two dishes I've tried there and will most likely be back to try more as they expand their menu. Glad something like this opened at t&t!"}
{"text":"Place is very very small, I would say it more of a take-out place instead of a restaurant.

We had the a noodles and spicy fish fillet cooked in chilli oil. They also gave us a salty cured chicken Appetizer for us to try.. 

I would say the the braised beef in the noodle was pretty good, the noodles were al Dante as well.. 3 stars.. I don't really crave for it

The spicy fish fillet cooked in chilli oil was 2 stars... reason being, the peppercorn chilli (major ingredient was missing) and the fish was falling fillet was falling apart..

I would go back for the cured salty chicken leg tho.."}
{"text":"The food is really salty and not spicy at all. I ordered the poached sliced pork in hot chilli oil and shredded potato with chilli oil. They are NOT spicy at all. The sliced pork is really salty. I can't taste anything other than the saltiness.  I am really disappointed. The shredded potato tastes weird... will not come back"}
