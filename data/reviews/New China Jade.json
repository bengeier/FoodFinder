{"text":"I've been going to China Jade since I was a baby. Not only is their food top notch, but the staff are wonderful, and the ambience & decor are comforting. They are one of the few places that are consistently amazing. I love their Jade Couple special with hot tea."}
{"text":"Very good value.  I love the jasmine tea, also.  Free with your meal.  Lunch specials are good and the price is great.  Atmosphere is a little dull and run down but not dirty.   Service is very good also."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have lived and traveled a lot. China jade is one of the best. Since moving to Pittsburgh we use to go once a week. Always consistent. Always delicious!  Owners are extremely nice and kind.  You will never be disappointed.  Wonton soup is flavorful and tender. We have had about everything on the menu it's all consustanrly good.  Thanks China Jade"}
{"text":"Great and friendly staff. Food is a deal for the price. Tasty and great for those on a budget, especially their lunch deal. Nothing greater than coming in on a cold Pittsburgh day for some hot tea and food for lunch."}
{"text":"Horrible! Phone service! Being honest I have ordered, picked up, and eaten in several time at this establishment several times and while the service has always been okay if any at all, understandable for this type of business, this most recent call was an embarrassment to customer service. Trying to call in and place an order for pick up or delivery and pay by credit card over the phone has never been this difficult. The female manager on the phone yelled complaining I was wasting her time, she had other better customer to get to, and even suggested I call somewhere else saying she did not want to deal with me, when I was asking about the price. I will never order from this establishment again. Their service has been atrocious!"}
{"text":"The handful of times I've eaten there, the food was excellent. Great selection. Dinner specialties a bit pricy. Wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"There were no tofu dishes on the lunch menu so I asked the waitress if they could make a tofu dish.  She said \"yes\" and asked what else I would like with the tofu and I said \"broccoli\".  I was served a huge plate of delicious tofu and broccoli in a brown sauce.  The bill was $5.50!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here once, never doing that again. Never received my food. Thank goodness I was paying cash. Worst customer service and sub par food for take out."}
{"text":"Truly a great General Tso chicken. Lunch prices are great, dinner is a great place for take out but pricey for take away. All in all been many times, always good. Soda was flat on my last visit, and the owner-manager-server did not agree, it was flat i tell ya, but do not come here looking for the staff to agree.. they just setve it up."}
{"text":"This place is exactly the sort of Chinese restaurant I love for lunch, and I'm so glad my husband \"rediscovered\" it after years away from the McKeesport area and brought me here recently.  They have a huge menu of lunch specials under six bucks and the portions are very good.  You can choose from a few options for your side item, and I was very happy with my hot and sour soup selection.  It was top notch.  I've eaten a lot of walnut shrimp but hadn't had walnut chicken, so that's what I ordered here.  It was sweet, creamy, and excellent, and while the chicken was fried they do a very light wonderful batter on it.  Garnished with broccoli, I didn't even need the rice to round out my lunch so I passed that off to my husband who very much enjoyed the shrimp fried rice and eggroll he ordered for himself.  We heard another patron getting hot jasmine tea and I wished we'd thought to order some, too.  Tiny, clean, peaceful and very green inside this cute place.  We got our food quickly which would be all the better reason to choose China Jade for a work day lunch.  If I return to the area I'll come back for sure!"}
