{"text":"If you are concerned about appearances and you like to go to restaurants to be seen dressed in suit and tie, then there are other options you would like to consider before Bombay Tandoori. 

If you like great food, family atmosphere, nice owner (yet a man of few words), no fluff & fair prices, then you'll enjoy this restaurant. Also, the place is now a BYOW, or beer.

It's a hole in the wall, it's clean yet maybe not like your crazy clean-freak aunt type clean. Good enough, you should have no worry whatsoever. It also makes the place more cosy and relax. 

And the best part...the food. Years ago, I used to live not too far. I since moved but come back once in a while just for it (and the pierogies of Goplana's nearby but that's for another review). I suggest you do not order the pre-made combos and experiment a little. You're not coming here for the salad anyway. 

There are good dishes and then there are great dishes. Why not order a bunch of currys and vegetable dishes, a couple of nans and then share? Anyway, try the methi gosht and the lamb dansak, they're definitely worth it. The butter chicken is not bad also.  The vegetable dishes are usually very fresh and tasty. All single curry and vegetable dishes come with rice so you'll have plenty. All this makes for a great lunch or dinner and you may have to loosen your belt at the end because you'll want to eat every bit of sauce left in the curry plates. 

After a great meal, you'll be presented with a very fair bill considering how well you've eaten. And you'll want to come back.

I'll give 5 stars, the guy deserves it fully.  For the price vs. the quality of what you get, there are not many places like it."}
{"text":"Sadly, this place really isn't great. We had take out and it just wasn't very tasty. We had a few meat and vegetarian dishes and only the lamb was fine. The meat dishes were so oily. The garlic naan was sweet and strange. I definitely do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best butter chicken In Montreal. MEILLEUR POULET AU BEURRE A MONTRÉAL.

L'endroit a l'air de rien, je recommande de prendre pour emporter et d'aller manger ailleurs car bien honnêtement, ce n'est pas super beau a l'intérieur. Le bhoona poulet et boeuf sont délicieux et épicés a souhait. Pour 12$ par personne vous avez amplement de nourriture pour 2 repas. Le poulet au beurre est vraiment une réussite : rien a voir avec la sauce orange et crémeuse d'épicerie. Livraison dans un périmètre limité. 

Le manager est super gentil !!"}
{"text":"I myself had take-out so I can't really comment on the cleanliness of the table clothes, but I can tell you that the naan was certainly not the best in town. I'd have to say the naan was probably the weakest part of the meal and was slightly burnt.

The rest of the food was fine, but on par with most other Indian take-out. I'd order again, but mostly for the convenience."}
{"text":"This is a great local Pointe Indian resto that has been around bad for at least 10 years. 
The malagatawny soup is usually delicious, nicely appointed with roasted garlic. The Dansak is very flavourful and the saag is perfect, as is the soft, sweetish naan. I would recommend the shrimp patia also, and the biryani is pleasant and comes with a side of sauce.
The iceberg lettuce salad is to be expected from a 3-course meal Indian restaurant and a nice touch. A bit run down but seems clean enough to me and great value for the lunch and supper specials. The owner is always welcoming and can cater as well."}
{"text":"I love Indian food, and this place was convenient, so we decided to get take out from this place. It's a hole in the wall but the food is made to please the Canadian palate (not too spicy, white meat, no fat/bones). The restaurant itself has air conditioning and you can BYOB. 

The specials we got each came with rice, naan, salad, and a samosa. Pretty good deal for $10-12. 

Hits: the 'sauce' that comes with the biryani, which is more similar to an Indian minetrone soup, loaded with flavour and veggies - biryani itself wasn't bad either; a paneer with spinach (though it was more spinach than paneer) - different than others I've had before as it was more like stir-fried spinach with onion/garlic (rather than creamy); and the rice, which is seasoned with some spices and fried onion (or was it garlic?) bits. 

Average: lamb korma, naan, samosas (heavy on the potatoes)

Misses: the butter chicken, which was way too sweet.

Portion sizes for the mains were normal. Bombay Tandoori is totally acceptable, especially with its reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I  decided to stop in and see what this place was all about, after reading the positive reviews about the naan bread being the best in the city.
Let me start by saying that the restaurant is completely ghetto which in my mind works in its favour, but not only is the decor ghetto the sanitary conditions are horrible. The table cloths haven't been washed in weeks, the floors look like they haven't been washed in days and the glasses don't really get washed more then they get dipped in dirty soapy water. My advice is to drink from the can and don't have water.

The service was O.K. it's a family place so it's more like eating in someones home where the family member were in the kitchen. This was kind of fun but unfortunately I felt like I was disturbing the waiter.
I ordered combo C which included samosas, chicken korai, rice, salad and naan. The samosas came quickly, maybe a little too quickly the outside was hot and the inside was stone cold. The chicken came out of the kitchen shortly after with the rice the salad and the naan.
The chicken was very good and the rice was very good. The salad on the other hand was disappointing iceberg lettuce with Kraft Italian dressing not what I would call appetizing. The naan bread that was described as being the best in the city. I have to disagree, don't get me wrong it's good but I've had as good or better.
This being said, it's hard to beat the price. My combo meal cost me $12 including a soft drink, but I can't say I'll be back, I can't get past the cleanliness issue. I like the ghetto feel but in my mind it should still be clean."}
{"text":"You may have walked passed this little gem without noticing it, but my advice next time is that you go in! This is seriously the best butter chicken I have had in Montreal, and I have tried so many places in search of the best. The sauce is delicious, presentation is great, they even shave a little almond to top the chicken, and a little something --I can't quite tell what it is but it's hella tasty--on the rice too. I honestly think the woman running the kitchen is magical. You can tell they cook everything from scratch and with love (and fresh ingredients!), which is not what I can say about most restaurants in the city. The prices are so reasonable, you are getting your money's worth and waaay more! The restaurant is definitely a family-run one and the owner is genuinely warm and attentive. Their Chai is aromatic and well-balanced in its spices, truly a treat for the soul."}
