{"text":"Our office held a \"Tacolympics\" which sampled tacos from more than 20 taco shops in the neighborhood. After a qualifying process, an 8 restaurant tournament decided the best tacos using head-to-head taste comparisons. Loreto's won. As a result, we order a large number of tacos from them every week. They're always great."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food! My favorites include the green chili burritos and carne asada tacos. The staff is so friendly and very efficient. I go there almost every week."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside is brightly painted and clean. This is on my way to the office, and occasionally I give into my craving for a bean and cheese burrito. I've gotta say, I've tried a lot of different places and this is my favorite!  Disclaimer: I haven't tried anything else on the menu. Both red and green salsas are great."}
{"text":"The food made me ill shortly after eating it which is surprising since the carne asada taco I ordered had very little meat. It came with a few tasteless crumbled pieces with tons of old-tasting lettuce which I removed. The chicken taco wasn't much better. Someburros on Baseline is a much better choice."}
{"text":"This place is the best hands down. Good food and the owners are solid people. Always quick and always consistent"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall type place. Absolutely delicious fish tacos. My only other complaint is that the Mexican rice was a little weak. Other than that gotta check it out. My coworkers had a burrito and said it was awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm here for Flight Attendant. This place has  Excellent service, Excellent food, Local food, a must if your in Tempe. This was a suggestion from our shuttle driver."}
{"text":"Amazing!  We came on $.99 taco wednesday.  We got a chicken and a beef, and paid the full price of $2.75 for a fish taco.  A side of chips and guacamole was also ordered.

Oh my it was yummy!  This place is a gem.  Don't let the building or neighborhood scare you away.  This is the best tacos in the Phoenix area!  Best fish taco I've had since being in LA."}
{"text":"Thank God for this traditional Sonoran take out. To all the Berto drive throughs take note to the flavors you get at a traditional Sonoran kitchen. Seriously have you ever tasted the bitter nasty hot sauce you get at a Berto? Taste the difference."}
{"text":"Gotta recommend .99 taco Wed.

Cheap and Good, not a high end place.

The Fish Taco is not a .99 one, but it's quite tasty.  Piña Agua Fresca quite Good."}
{"text":"$.99 taco Wednesdays. Can't beat that deal. The best taco shells I've ever had. Freshly fried taco shells. The Meat tastes great too."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price. A small local neighborhood. Mom and pop kind of place. Most dinners on menu were $8 drink not included. Or refills although when we went back for refills they did not charge. Indoor and outdoor seating"}
{"text":"Average mexican food - Just Ok

I wouldn't go out of my way for this food as it's very average mexican food. They offer  things like hamburgers etc. For better food and better service I would rather eat at Garcias."}
{"text":"This place is adorable on the inside, the decor is amazing and the seating is limited but your going to love this food ! My carne tacos were Delicious, and the burrito was amazing as well! I could tell it was all fresh ingredients and the salsa selection is amazing. Prices are not to bad for the sizes you Receive. 
This place is nestled in the middle of an cultured area and be sure stop by when your near. Won't be mad at all; unless there's no seating inside when it's hot lol"}
{"text":"Sooooooo goooooood. Tried carne asada taco, fish taco, rolled taco, chili relleno. All delicious."}
{"text":"Quick cheap Mexican food right by the house. Good for when you need a fix, and they've got a good bulk deal in carne asada."}
{"text":"They make my absolute favorite camarones cocktel in AZ which I'd been wanting for the longest time, and a large was only $9.99; it was filled with plump shrimp, lots of fresh cilantro, and avocado, the salsa was not too salty or Clamato-y as some can be. I'm giggling a little as I type this because Scott couldn't find the place with GPS when he was right out front, and then erroneously ordered a ceviche, but that just meant I had bomb Mexican two days in a row! The \"accidental\" ceviche was light and flavorful with generous portions of shrimp, fish, and avocado, all brightened by citrus. 

It is literally a taco shack in Guadalupe, but don't be scurred my Gringos, you will live to down some damned tasty burros, tacos, etc at super reasonable prices served up by very nice folks. Scott highly recommends the carne asada; Guadalupe is not dangerous, we are fine going there at night, YMMV. I'm literally sad our new place is further away from here, but we will be regulars no doubt.i

*** we were told that to snag their tamales, you have to come early in the day ***"}
{"text":"I give Loreto's 5 stars because there simply isn't anything wrong here,  and that's what makes them excellent.    It's a \"filibertos\" format,  but with enough uniqueness to the recipes and menu to stand apart.     I have enjoyed every meal I've eaten here.   LOVE their tortas!   And the carne asada is lean,  high quality cuts."}
{"text":"As the saying goes, \"Never Judge a Book by it's Cover\" ... Loreto's doesn't look like much when you first pull into the parking lot and it's located in a not so great area of town, but that won't keep the true foodies away from this hole-in-the-wall hidden gem! ;) 

Twas a scorching hot Taco Tuesday when I asked the yelp search Gods for a referral for some amazing local Mexican cuisine and you guessed it ... Loreto's seemed to have the best reviews in the area. 

It's located in Guadalupe right on the border of S Tempe ... And as I mentioned above it looks like a run down taco stand at first glance.  When I walked up to the counter yup still looked like a little run down taco stand, but I trust in the yelp force ;)

They have quite an extensive menu and it's very reasonably priced.  I opted for the breakfast burrito even though it was Taco Tuesday ... It had been so long since I've had a breakfast burrito that I couldn't resist, especially since they said they could make mine with egg whites - bonus points there!!!  I have tried a few other Mexican restaurants and whenever I requested eggs whites they denied me :(  But not Loreto's!!! ;)

I sat down for about 5-10min in the not so well kept or eye appealing indoor/outdoor seating area (no A/C or fans out here, but not so horrible in the shade) ... I got my food to go because it was super hot out and let's be serious it's not the most comfortable clean place to hang out in, but the great tasting food made up for the lack of ambiance ...

I ordered the Loreto's breakfast burrito and it came with chips and several salsas and it was muy delicioso!!!  Very tasty and a very nice portion size ... I actually had trouble finishing it.  The chips and salsa were also very good as well.

Loreto's earned my future business that is for sure ... The staff was cool and the food was good.  The only thing that kept it from earning a 5 star yelp review had to do with the not so aesthetically pleasing sitting area itself ... I probably would recommend this place for take out only especially when it's 100+ degrees outside.

Overall, it was a very good experience food wise, and I will be back to try out their carne asada tacos next!! I would recommend others to come try out there food as well ... just don't expect anything fancy look-wise from the restaurant itself and probably avoid coming here at night after dark."}
{"text":"This place is great! 

The Staff:

The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They will absolutely make sure that you're happy with your order and leave satisfied with their service. 

The Food: 

The food was really good! The burritos average less than $6 and come with chips and salsa. The burritos are pretty hefty and could potentially last you two meals if you have a small appetite. I tried the chorizo burrito and added beans. I was not disappointed. 

Overall, I highly recommend trying this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Loreto's is my go to spot whenever I come to the Phoenix area. I have never been disappointed, no matter what I order. I really love their carne asada fries and guac. I highly recommend them! Also, make sure you're calling the correct location if you call in an order  The staff is always friendly, which I look for when I eat at restaurants."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp cocktail..it was pretty good. I love to see variety in a menu and this place has plenty! Would love it if they were open a little later though. It's located in the town of Guadalupe which for some reason people think is the kind of area you would get mugged in or something but it really isn't like that and I have never felt like I had to worry walking down the street. It's pretty safe compared to parts of Phoenix. All in all I like this little hole in the wall. It's super close to my work so I'll be coming on my lunch breaks!"}
{"text":"I love Loreto's!!! Everything I have tried is amazing. My favorite is definitely the pozole- not sure if anywhere has a better one. The lengua burrito is also really good as well as the chorizo and egg breakfast burrito. I live right down the street and it's hard not to stop here almost everyday. Highly recommend trying it! The staff is also really nice and I usually call my order in ahead of time and it's always ready in less than 10 mins which great."}
{"text":"Favorite Authentic spot since moving to the area!  For starters it's in the most perfect spot that's secluded but not really secluded! It's like I'm sitting home enjoying a meal with my family except they can't cook these dishes  Your dish is prepared upon order hot and fresh! Little Wait Time Amazing Pricing Good Food Overall!  I'm impressed can't wait to come back again! Loreto's gave me life this evening!"}
{"text":"Visit 7# update below:
YOU KNOW THIS PLACE IS GOOD WHEN..... I am on the WRONG side of town , for most people not me, and there are always Gringos here eating. So today is like my 5th plus time here. THIS IS MY GO TO for Burritos and such. The salsas are fresh and tasty. The burros and tacos are superior to other \"burro\" type places due to ingredients and price. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. They don't skimp on the size either. 
Update: The battle is down to which burrito to get, The carne Asada with rice and beans( perfect flavors both, spicy not spicy is the only question) or the green chili and rice. Their green Chile is the spicy one of the two chiles. If I'm n Tempe this place is always an option. 
FYI I alway try and snag some Menudo on Sat for Sunday's. Not Adrian's in Mesa but legit."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall taqueria is great!! 
The menu was nice and varied. 
I had a carne asada torta with beans no rice. The bread was toasted perfectly! It was loaded up with meat, beans, lettuce, onion, pickled jalapeño, mayo, and guacamole (I left the tomato off). The torta was full of flavor and good bread really makes all the difference and that was good bread. 
The beans were good old plain refried beans with cheese on the top. 
I opted out on the Spanish rice but my husband got it and he said his was just ok. It was his least favorite of his meal (he also got a crane asada torta. It was a little mushy for him. 
I am a bit of a water snob so I chose to get a orange Fanta out of the bottle because I was doubtful the water would taste decent. My husband got some though and he said it was pretty good for city water so I tasted it and wished I would have just got water too (just not a soda drinker).
I would recommend this place for sure and will probably return when I'm on that side of town and want good Mexican food. 
One thing to keep in mind, it is outdoor seating only so during the day it will be hot. There are no fans to circulate the air. 
4 stars only because of the mushy rice - everything else was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Very authentic!!! Came upon this little place in Guadalupe through a recommendation from a friend and let me tell you, I was very impressed!! They serve the best mini chimies and crispy tacos I've ever had. Not only that, but the service is 110%. The staff is so friendly and ensures that everything is to your satisfaction. This will definitely be my go-to Mexican food restaurant now when I'm feeling the craving!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Good, cheap and fast Mexican food. Their beans are vegan, just a heads up. I'll come back again and again"}
{"text":"Everything we've tried is always fresh tasting and delicious.  Typical Mexican menu plus some American mac & cheese/chicken fingers for kids and some burgers.

Fan of the entire menu.  But I think this location is best considered as Guadalupe, unless that side of the street is Tempe(?)

I have ordered several catering platters and they're always a hit for b-days and work events.  Yummy dark red salsa too."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place today after seeing their sign for $1.25 tacos on Wednesday. I really always try to stop at places for tacos on days other than only Tuesdays so this was my spot today. They have the option of beef or chicken and I ordered three beef. They were AWESOME! They come in a deep fried shell and were full. I live pretty close to there and know where I'll be having tacos on Wednesdays from now on. Definitely worth trying out!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I had the carne asada burrito and a shrimp taco. Both were excellent. The quality of meat they use for the carne asada was Top Notch and considering it was only less than $6 you can't beat it. The shrimp taco had a handful of shrimp in it, a very good tortilla and cabbage and cheese. Their salsa and chips were very good. Overall probably the best $12 meal I've ever had including Drink"}
{"text":"Classic \"whole in the wall\" Filibertos style restaurant.  Very unpretentious and basic style. Located in Guadalupe. Ordered the Chili Rellenos special for lunch. Reasonably priced at ~ $7. I usually only buy the Chili Rellenos dinners -so I can compare all the Mexican restaurants an also because I love this dish.
Anyways - rice nice and fluffy,beans tasty and Chili Rellenos very tasty. Also came with a side of salsa and another spicy sauce. I talked to some of the locals who were  eating there and they all seemed very happy with the food. One guy pointed out that he always came on a Wednesdays for the $1 Tacos. Unfortunately I missed the specials signs.  Nice covered area out front plus eating in-side if required.

As Arni said - \"I'll be back\""}
{"text":"This is my favorite local taco shop.  They are all hard workers, the food is very good.  I love the chicken tacos.  The people who liked Someburros or Garcias more have no taste.  The carne asada reminds me of the arrancheras back home."}
{"text":"Authentic DoCal type Mexican food.  Had a pastor burrito without beans inside.  \"With everything\" means beans, cilantro and onion.  Cilantro and onion YES!!! Beans seemed odd to me, but I guess it would make for  a bigger burrito.

Had a nice little orange pol of grease at the burrito butt, so you know it was good!"}
{"text":"The Loretos Burger cane upon a recommendation. I also ordered it with Rolled Tacos and Green Tomatillo salsa, because I can. I never thought I would find an amazing burger  in a Mexican Restaurant. This had diced bacon  which was so much better than leaving in strips. I'm now asking the bacon to be diced from now on if it's possible. They were so nice too."}
{"text":"This is seriously great Mexican food.  Arturo and Karen provide fantastic service and their food is unreal.  Three items I'd rate as \"must haves\".  
1. Try any menu item served with adobada. Really good marinated pork.
2. Tamales.  Green or red, try them both!  Home made and very popular. Better show up early or they'll be gone!
3. House special, crazy taco.  Bacon makes everything better!  Melt in your mouth good.

Low prices provide an unbelievable value for what you'll get.  So glad we found this gem!"}
{"text":"Stopped in by chance, after not being able to find another restaurant in the area. There were quite a few cars in the lot and people eating outside. Found out it was 99 cent taco Wednesday. I was going to try a few tacos, but they only had the special for hard shell, not soft tacos, so I went for the carnitas. 

You order through a small window and then wait for the food to be done. There is no table service. Food was priced well, but the portions were not large. I had enough carnitas meat for two tacos only and the rice and beans were maybe 3/4 of a spoon full. The flavor overall was average at best. The salsa was bland."}
{"text":"Their chicken fajitas and chimichangas are great ... will be going back for sure... since its a family owned business they keep a check on the taste and quality"}
