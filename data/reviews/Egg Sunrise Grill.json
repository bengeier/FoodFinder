{"text":"Friendly blonde lady greeted and seated me in a flash, dropped off water and menu and offered coffee right away. The menu was quite extensive for a small place and the place was really busy , food was flying out, quickly and the waitress was handling like a Pro. Food was great and hot, the coffee was tasty and never ending. I had the three egg omelette with cheese, a side of sausages and rye toast at a very reasonable price. I strongly recommend this place. Good food, great service and clean cozy surrounding. If your 're hungry this is the place to go !"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic late breakfast. The owner and staff were very friendly and accommodating of our children nut allergies. Glad we stumbled onto this little cool restaurant!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim because I'd noticed it was busy and bustling -- very glad we did! 

This place is chill and unpretentious like an old school diner, but there's an up-to-date and down-to-earth commitment to the food quality and service.

As for the breakfast -- it's all in the photo. Dark rye? Yes, please. Breakfast potatoes that are just fried boiled potatoes? Not frozen deep-fried sawdust squares? Yes, please. 

Food came hot and fast, several servers checked in on us offering condiments, more coffee, clearing plates, all friendly, joking. 

There's an awesome vibe here, relaxed crowd, good prices, check it out."}
{"text":"This place is just a close to my house. The staff are extremely friendly and accommadating. I love their pancakes, perfectly cooked, nice and golden brown. Just like how i cook them at home. I hate restaurants that burned their pancakes. It is not good for your health and taste bitter. I always grab their pancakes in the morning if i am too busy to cook some."}
{"text":"Great fast tasty breakfast with super friendly service. Chris was a great host!!!! She's great with kids - which is more than I can say for all the other breakfast spots in the area. Thanks for the great time."}
{"text":"Wow! So much better than the original sunset grill. Parking is easy and cheap on the street. Staff is warm and welcoming. The fresh squeezed grapefruit juice was delicious and the food was scrumptious! We loved it so much and will be back! Also cheaper prices than the sunset grill chain."}
{"text":"We were jet lagged and needed to have breakfast very early. Bakeries were still closed and we found Egg Sunrise Grill. Service was excellent and the food as well. We ordered grilled chese (kids), Super 9 and the Farm eggs with bacon. So so so good! Everything came with home fries and while it's also delicious, the servings were huge (for us). We plan to go there regularly while still living in the neighborhood and make it our go-to breakfast place."}
{"text":"Egg Sunrise Grill gets a raving great review from me... went here for breakfast/brunch today. Service was amazing. Sat ourselves right away. Julie, our server, presented waters and took coffee orders pretty much right away. 

They were small, 8 Oz cups but you get an infinite amount of free refills, which is definitely a plus. 

I ordered the gorgeous green omelette, green peppers, spinach and Swiss cheese... Thick, cheesy. My mouth falls in love with this egg omelette that tasted like pizza. Instead of home fries I ordered fresh fruit. The fruit was ripe: grapes, strawberries, oranges, canteloupe and honey dew marry in my mouth. A rarity at breakfast places but Sunrise Grill pulls it off. 

My boyfriend got a whopping 3 eggs Bene with 2 large pieces of pemeal bacon on 3 English muffins, smothered in hollandaise sauce next to a healthy portion of delicious home fries.  All for $9.75. This not only tasted stupendous and satisfied his taste buds but also was the best deal he's come across ever. Guaranteed best price he says!

Definitely recommend going here any day!"}
{"text":"Great eggs benedict, pemeal bacon is generously cut, large serving of pan seared potatoes. Excellent traditional holandais. Service was also excellent. Lots of coffee refills"}
{"text":"Gord and I had breakfast this morning at Egg Sunrise Grill.  Though it's in our 'hood and walked and driven by it often, we've never been there before.

We both ordered an Awesome All-Day Breakfast and they were delicious. 
 Gord ordered bacon and eggs.  He also got a coffee which was refilled a couple times.  I ordered peameal bacon and eggs.

Galina was our server.  She was friendly and took good care of us.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! I am very fussy ... I own a bed and breakfast that is known for its outstanding breakfasts ... and this place does not disappoint.  When we are travelling we like to eat breakfast in diners.  We like the homemade potatoes, the real bacon, perfect eggs... This place hits the mark. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very good asparagus eggs Benedict! Friendly atmosphere and relatively speedy service."}
