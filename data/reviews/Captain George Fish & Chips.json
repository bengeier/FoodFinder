{"text":"I was just lucky to come across this restaurant.I was early for an appointment so decided to wander around the area. The owner was friendly, the portions were large and satisfying. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Got the halibut family meal takeout. Very satisfying meal - deep fried goodness. Will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always immaculate in cleanliness. The service is always outstanding because the senior staff have \"eyes in the back or their heads\". The food is fresh and properly prepared.  We regularly drive the 7 km past no less than 4 other fish and chip shops, including another CG's to eat here. No idea how expensive it is because it matters very little when getting food and service of this quality consistantly. i do know I leave satisfied for lass than half the money of a bug chain establishment. I strongly encourage anyone who has a bad experience here to return and give George the opportunity to make it right for you."}
{"text":"Like many other fish & chip places in the area. Maybe this one is a tad more organized and busier but the owner is a cheapo!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat fish and chips because this is wonderful. Most wonderful fish and chips I ever had for the first time I tried."}
{"text":"This is our favorite fish and chip shop!  I find fish and chips are expensive take out to begin with, but its worth it.  We have always had super friendly dining experiences, and they are very family friendly.    The Greek salad is also an amazing addon, but be sure to ask for dresssing on the side."}
{"text":"Overall, a disappointing experience. We live in the area and thought we'd give the place a try. Reviews we'd read elsewhere said that the portions are large, but I would disagree. I found the fish to be cut fairly thin, which made it dry and tougher to chew. What was worse were the fries. They were thin, overlooked and very greasy. At the end of dinner, my mouth felt like it was coated in lard. Very disappointing! Won't come back. I gave this place 2 stars since at least the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent service. We were greeted by the cook, very cool guy. Instantly ordered the captains special. It's such a good deal $20 for 2 fish n chips, scallops, shrimp, onion rings and garden salad. We were seated although you can take out too. It's a small place. We ordered and we were served in 10 minutes or less. The food tasted amazing. The fish was crispy and the fries looked homemade. Definitely will come back!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got takeout from this location on the night shortly following the ice storm. We wanted something different and called over for takeout. Upon arriving, the restaurant was almost empty, but the guy behind the counter was very friendly and had our meals packed up and ready to go.  I wasn't sure how fish and chips would fare after a cold car ride home but man did they ever do well! We both got the halibut meal, which comes with two or three pieces of fish (really really good portion size, I stretched mine into two dinners), fries and a garden salad.   The fish had a great thin battered coating and was nice and crispy, even after a 10 minute ride home. Great flavor and went well with the fries, which were also really good! The portion size was what drove it home for me - for $30-35 for two people, we both had leftovers and even after reheating it was still pretty good!  Overall, a great meal and we'll be back for sure. Super tasty fish n chips and fast friendly service! One thing to note tho - the parking lot was SUPER icy, all ice and hadn't been salted. Difficult to walk on and I was afraid I'd fall..."}
