{"text":"The selection here is average, but you get a lot of food for your money, especially since they let you take out, which is probably a better deal, since you probably won't eat that much in a single setting."}
{"text":"Cheap buffet, but doesn't have a big variety of food. The food is very good although it is very Americanized. This place has been around for many years and if you're craving cheap food this is one of the best places in the area! I do think they need to switch out the food some more, sometimes there tends to be cold food laying around or dishes that are finished and are not replaced quickly enough, specially for lunch. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant! It won't let you down!"}
{"text":"REVISIT story

I'm so bummed to have returned here while visiting family and see how badly the service has gone down to. The food is STILL great but the ladies here have grown callous and super rude."}
{"text":"Seriously, the best Chinese buffet I've ever had.   It does not have a huge selection (it's a smaller place), but everything it has is great. I love the mei fun noodles and fried scallops. They also have a variety of chicken dishes that are terrific. I come here twice a week."}
{"text":"Looking for a cheap - not high quality - chinese buffet? here ya go, you'll find all your classic american favorites (orange chicken, beef and brocolli, crab rangoon, fried rice etc) but the plus side, CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. Good place for just a I'm starving but Broke restaurant"}
{"text":"Everything I have tried on there buffet is amazing but I especially love their Peanut Chicken.  #1 reason I come here! I go at least once or twice a week!"}
{"text":"By far the greatest thing to have ever graced my mouth. Amazing general tso's chicken."}
{"text":"The service was impeccable. Qing-tan was so nice, she treats you just like family! The food could be better, but nothing beats the value here. We will come back here again when we visit our son Michael Mwarm at the University of Illinois. He is studying agribusiness."}
{"text":"I stopped for lunch at Sunny China Buffet almost as soon as it opened at 11:00 on a Sunday. All of the items on the buffet were very fresh and looked great. There are three buffet areas; appetizers / soups, entrees / sides and salad / desserts. I started with hot and sour soup and egg rolls. The soup was bland, but the egg rolls were fresh and crispy. All of the chicken dishes I tried (peanut chicken, black pepper 
chicken and sweet & sour) were very good. Lo mein noodles with vegetables was also tasty. All of the desserts appear to be purchased (almond cookies, pastries, pudding) instead of house made. I had almond cookies and lychee fruit (canned I believe, but good). A half dozen flavors of scoop-your-own ice cream sit in their own little freezer next to the dessert buffet too. One thing that made me smile was the baked macaroni and cheese that was on the entree buffet, clearly there to accommodate parents who want to go out for Chinese, and bring their kids along. I thought that was a nice touch. Service (for beverages, condiments like Chinese mustard, and delivering the check) was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Worst ever. Only go if you want to be sick for days. The food they have out has been sitting for ages and is not even hot. Rice is dried out. Floor hasn't been cleaned in years. Avoid!"}
{"text":"I used to go here every Friday night. The buffet is still very good but service has deteriorated. I was seated at a table (although I asked for a booth). They kept seated people at the same table. It was loud and not private at all. If you must go here, go at 2 p.m. or so when you might be able to sit where you are comfortable. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food quality remains very good. Every time, it satisfied my anticipation. Highly recommend this Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"it's ok, very good for the price range. very cheap."}
{"text":"I really like this place! It's been around for a long time now and I always know I can count on them for lots of yummy fixings. They are a little more limited on the number of options compared to other buffets; however, I think the options they do have are well thought out \"classics\". The facility is always clean and tidy."}
