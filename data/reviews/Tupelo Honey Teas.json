{"text":"Tupelo Honey Teas has had several incarnations and the latest is their new cafe in Millvale, opened November 2016. The cafe is cozy and has tons of charm and personality. Danielle, the owner, will win you over with her infectious passion and knowledge about tea. You can buy tons of varieties of loose leaf teas, including Danielle's custom blends, or get a hot or iced cup to go or for in house. Tupelo Honey Teas now serves vegetarian food made from scratch; the roasted vegetable & hummus sandwich, chickpea salad sandwich, potato & kale soup, and kale & cabbage salad with poppyseed dressing we tried were all delicious! Great spot to unwind or for lunch."}
{"text":"AMAZING loft space with tons of unique, delicious teas, a variety of sundries for sake and and the best honey I have ever tasted. The owner is a delight and extremely knowledgeable about everything tea related and can recommend tea for many different types of health problems - insomnia, heart health, stress  headaches, stomachaches. She's amazing! And she's constantly thinking up new blends and planning new events - definitely check this place out, you won't be disappointed!   Personal favorites are Peppermint Guayusa, Calm & Focused, Sleepyhead, Blueberry Rooibos and Strawberry Green."}
{"text":"Love this place! Tea selection was awesome and I had the best grilled cheese I've ever had here. I pride myself on my own grilled cheeses, but their pepper jam made theirs unbeatable. I also tried a scone which was pretty good."}
{"text":"I attended a BatCat (https://batcatpress.com/about/) class there yesterday (making mini-book ornaments).  Such fun!  In front of the little fire place, 6 of us sat cutting and pasting (in real life, not on the computer!) and sewing and feeling happy with our final results.  Afterward, i had a Greek salad which Stephanie was kind enough to create with my special request for no onions.  It was an AMAZING salad!  Perfect lemony dressing, Greek olives, capers, feta - I was VERY impressed.  This was my 3rd time there - once was for a community meeting, and another time for tea with a friend.  This isn't an old fashioned tea party type tea shop  - the cups aren't all dainty - many are beautifully hand produced heavy ceramic mugs, many are vintage, but big.   The setting is small and intimate, with room for overflow in the adjoining library.  free wifi too.  Plus a HUGE selection of teas and information about each type available - and some attractively packaged gift packages involving tea.  you'd never guess that the place is so new - because Danielle, the owner has thought every detail out very carefully and things ran smoothly all 3 times I've been there.   you should go."}
{"text":"Attended a Tea Shop Hop event here and took home a custom blended tea. The place is little but the people are friendly and knowledgeable.  I didn't try anything off the menu but it's nice to know where you can take your vegan friends for a fun and inclusive field trip. I'd go back for another event!"}
{"text":"First time here and I was delighted to walk into a cozy warm shop. The service is beyond amazing and I immediately felt welcome immediately. Had the Moroccan Lentil soup a definite favorite!  I will be back and highly recommend this gem!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! I had the Brie grilled cheese sandwich and it was so delicious! Large variety a tea for every tea lover!"}
{"text":"Since giving up soda, I drink a lot more tea and coffee.  But mostly, more tea.  Things I look for when buying tea are not just good flavor.  I tend to like the green teas more, along with a good chai or Earl Grey.  But Tupelo Honey Teas is so much more.    It's a small little shop nestled next to the Millvale Library on Grant Street.  It's easy to miss (I drove by it several times before using the library as a reference point) but when you find it, you may never want to leave.  Owner Danielle is not only one of the nicest and friendliest people I've ever met, she's a tea making master as well.  The options are endless and you can taste her passion in every cup.  When you walk in, there is a room to the right filled with jars of tea from floor to ceiling.  I've tried several different green teas and loved them all.  I've even gone for some of the caffeine free options.  There are often seasonal offerings as well as themed teas created for fund-raising (like the Nebby Chai that helped Rick Sebak's Kickstarter or the Veni, Vidi, Vanka to help with the preservation of the Vanko murals at St. Nicholas Church).  There's also the Yinzer tea series with names like Bridges, The Jagoff, and Black & Gold.  Over the holidays, I may have spent more money on tea than the average person and was given a sample of the Market Spice tea which became my winter favorite.    Tupelo Honey Teas does more than tea, though.  They have Pam in the kitchen daily making some of the most delicious vegetarian and vegan treats.  It's a great cozy spot to stop in with a book for a quiet and leisurely lunch.  Soups are always spot on and the baked goods are brilliant.   Beyond the everyday, Tupelo Honey Teas hosts events like cooking classes, make your own tea and even pop-up events.  I shop small whenever I can.  But when you see and taste what they put together here, you'll want to support them even more."}
{"text":"I love this place! What a great addition to Millvale! The owner is so welcoming and friendly, and her teas and food are both delicious and exciting.   Chatting about the tea, the owner talked us through all the kinds she had available, suggested we take smells and made recommendations. I chose the Kenyan tea with a bit of honey - each cup is served wonderfully hot and can be refilled for a second cup.  I had the Brie & Pepperjam sandwich that came with a side of cantaloupe - it was fantastic! The pepperjam was spicy and the sandwich was grilled perfectly. Others in my group had salads, sandwiches, hot and cold tea, and we all agreed it was great!  On top of all that - the space is adorable and connects to the library which has a small outdoor deck that we were able to use for our group to enjoy lunch on a summer day. I will be back (probably every time I'm in Millvale!)"}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time today on a rainy Sunday afternoon. We were the only customers there, and had the pleasure of spending time chatting with Mandy. We were greeted by what must be the most cosy and homely cafe in Pittsburgh. It felt like I was walking into someone's home. The room was filled with local handmade items, freshly baked goods, and of course, an extensive tea room with every kind of tea you could want! All teas are blended in house, and they are working on using herbs grown in a community garden in Millvale in some blends! You can even sniff the tea that you want in little jars that are laid out. We spent more than an hour there relaxing, browsing through the many gifts, books, and other goodies, and enjoying our tea and cookies. They are a vegan cafe and usually have a creative food menu on weekdays. What an amazing spot in Millvale! Please visit and support this local business!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely adorable! It's connected next door to the Millvale Community Library, so it has an interesting vibe and who doesn't love to have caffeine while with a book?  Let's start with my trip to the cafe. I was coming from a nearby food truck festival and left a little disappointed with the food offerings. Knowing that the cafe was close by and on my list of places to check out, I promptly walked over and found the cafe. It was almost 2 PM and I know I was trying my luck with any pastry. There was a peach scone left, along with chocolate chip muffins, and chocolate chip cookies. Peach scone, please! It is vegan and not being vegan, I still thoroughly enjoyed the delicious pastry. It would have been nice to have it warmed, but no fret. It was tasty still. I also checked in and got a delightful cherry basil ice tea.   I browsed around afterwards and got some teas to take home. It's so great to find Honeybush. I'm excited to try it along with the black and gold--the ginger smells amazing. The wild Thai black has a strong aroma, can't wait to steep the teas!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to have in Millvale. Come here for a meal, grab something on the go, or explore the huge amount of varieties to buy and brew at home. The owner and staff are extremely welcoming and knowledgeable. Tell them what you like, and they'll be able to make several suggestions for you. The food is fresh, homemade, and delicious. The space is cozy, and it connects to the library which you can access from inside during business hours. As if all this didn't exceed expectations, I love that the owner collaborates with so many other local businesses. From serving tea-infused cocktails at local bars to brewing beer with the local breweries to collaborating with the library to host events in the shared back yard, Tupelo Honey Teas defines what it means to be part of a community!!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Cute decor, a perfect place to journal while sipping tea and eating simple, fresh food. The staff were super knowledgeable about teas and helped me find the perfect blend to try. I ended up buying some to take home!"}
{"text":"What a cute little place! My friends and I went for a pop up donut sale (Wolf Teeth Donuts) but we had tea and ate some of Tupelo's food as well.   I enjoy unsweetened ice teas, and Tupelo had a couple of great flavors. The Black and Gold was very gingery and great, but I think the Moroccan Mint was the winner for me.   I also had a vegan sandwich while we were waiting for the donuts. The lady working there was great and recommended a couple of things, and I ended up going with the chickpea salad sandwich. I've never had a vegan sandwich that was so creamy!!!   The shop itself is really cute as well. It's tiny inside, but they sell loose leaf teas, a couple of little trinkets, and some books as well.  I will be back for a quiet cup of tea, and to try some more sandwiches."}
{"text":"Tea is great and the food is AMAZING. It's all vegetarian or vegan, but it's stuff even non-vegetarians will love. My fiancé is a very \"meat and potatoes\" guy but he LOVES the food at Tupelo as much as I do.   They have a bajillion flavors of tea and there's little samples of each one that you can smell. Get a cup of tea there or buy tea in bulk to take home. Definitely better and cheaper than Teavana."}
{"text":"My visit to Tupelo Honey Tea was accidental but made my day and week.  I've been going through some difficult times ans had had a rough morning.  I was looking for somewhere to treat myself and my other between the North Hills and town.  When the first place we tried was a bust I whipped out Yelp and we were rewarded with Tupelo.  It was the oasis we needed.  We entered the beautiful little shop and were warmly greeted by the owner.  There were a couple parties ahead of us and more came in behind us...when it rains it pours as she was working alone.  She deftly triaged everyone.  We had planned on lingering so we offered to go last.  She got someone a to go drink and spent time in the loose leaf tea room getting multiple sales wrapped up there.  Meanwhile we explored the cute shop and found the adult coloring books and puzzle games.  When the owner finished with everyone else she was effusively apologetic and kept adding freebies to our order: a bigger tea and cookies for us both.  I sheepishly showed her the Yelp check in coupon and she knocked that off, too.  We ordered a hot Vietnamese green tea and a cold blueberry roiboos tea.  The iced tea was good; the green tea was excellent.  The owner let me take the pouch of tea with me and I enjoyed it for several more days.  We also ordered a grilled brie sandwich and a chick pea salad sandwich; we shared.  Both were served with long crisp celery sticks, a nice touch.  The sandwiches were delicious and balanced each other out.  The chocolate chip cookies were delightful.  We got into conversation with the owner and she told us a lot about Millvale.  I grew up in the North Hills and honestky misunderstood where the community was located until we followed Yelp.  We really enjoyed our long chat with the owner.  She said Mondays are usually the quietest day as the library next door is closed on Mondays.  I can only hope to come back and visit again!"}
{"text":"We love this funky, inviting loft and the tea is outstanding. I have about a dozen different teas from the Tea Loft and they are all very good.  Trust Danielle, the owner, to guide you to blends that you may not have considered, but will be happy you did. My favorite is the Gingerman, and for a dessert tea, the Banana Fana is delish.  Inside this warehouse is an oasis of warmth and great vibes.  Go, and drink the best tea you can buy in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Amazing tea. Amazing customer service. I had an order to ship as a gift and botched the address. Danielle called me and got it worked out despite the delays on my part. Aside from this, you won't find better tea. Strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with this uber-adorable little tea place! It is so eclectic and colorful on the outside before you even enter. It says 'Imagine' on the front of the building. LOVE.  I came in here and was greeted by the most sweet woman working at the time and she explained to me about all the different teas. I was looking for a caffiene free iced tea and she helped me make a selection that I loved.  There are teapots that line the shelves on the wall, a HUGE room with canister upon canister of tea and local handmade pottery for sale too. It is quiet, cozy, colorful and unique here. I really enjoyed my experience and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to get my wife some teas for her bday, and I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. The staff member picked out a bunch of little packs for my wife and she loved the gift. I'll be back with my wife when she runs out to get more."}
{"text":"Coming here was such an great experience. It is amazing how knowledgable Danielle is about teas.  There is every type of tea imaginable available. I drink tea occasionally but I am more of a coffee drinker. Since I wanted stronger tea with a lot of caffeine, they recommended that I try the vanilla pu-erh. I was really surprised how delicious it was. It was blended with vanilla and mint which gave it an amazingly smooth taste and covered up any bitter after taste that usually accompanies pu-erh. I ended up leaving with a sample box with 10 different blends. The box was hand made by a local artist and it was meant to be a gift but I couldn't resist and already brewed a few of the sample sizes satchels. The atmosphere was very warm and inviting. It's the perfect place to study, have a meeting, or catch up with a friend."}
{"text":"If I hadn't had such a big lunch over in the Southside I most certainly would have eaten here. With a check in you are entitled to one free hot or ice tea of your choice. I opted for the English breakfast tea and it was so good! They have all types you can imagine including green and oolong teas.  I love supporting small businesses and they also have an area where you can purchase African jewelry and crafts to support a charity. One room is filled with all the different teas that they carry. You can either buy a cup or loose leaf is weighed by the ounce depending upon what type you get. There's lots to choose from.  Most of the food is either vegan or vegetarian. I really wanted to get that vegan flatbread covered with pesto, red onions, and peppers to take home but since the bread was made fresh today the owner told me it wouldn't keep for more than one day. Instead, I settled for a vegan chocolate chip cookie. They also serve Leona's ice cream sandwiches in a freezer which are made in Wilkinsburg-those are not vegan. They have a great selection of various ice cream filling flavors for these treats.  The owner was extremely nice to me and showed me where I could sit. The business is currently working on composting. I learned that after seeing my straw fall apart each time I went to use one.  The cookie was good and before I left I saw in their refrigerator paper sealed cups of soups. I was told these were left over and sold at discounted prices. I ended up getting the sweet potato, carrot, and apple soup since I learned I could freeze it. Got it home and tried a little. it was out of this world good! I froze it immediately for a meal at home.  The shop also carries various teapots and accessories used to make your tea and has some lovely things to look at. The table where I was sitting actually had a checkerboard painted on it. The dining area is small and there is a side door that leads you into the library next door without having to go outside.  I'm looking forward to returning soon to not only try some more of their teas but also have lunch here. The daily menu is on a piece of paper on one of their glass counters. Inexpensive metered street parking is right outside."}
{"text":"This place is perfect.  I am an avid coffee drinker and came here to try their food, but decided to give their coconut chai a try...and I was so stoked I did.   Not only is the staff incredible helpful and down to earth, BUT THE FOOD PEOPLE!!  I had the vegan walkabout: a warm stuffed sandwich with various veggies including the worst garbage weed, kale.  I DIDN'T MIND THE KALE...the whole sandwich was that good.  Naturally, that wasn't enough because I am constantly hungry.  What's this?  A vegan scone?  Oh you probably mean a dry triangle with some vague flavor of berry.  WRONG.  The creamsicle scone was everything a scone should be.  Slightly sweet, perfect orange and vanilla flavors, and PERFECTLY baked without a hint of dryness.    Your whole world will be better by coming here.  Their menu rotated and everything is so damn good."}
{"text":"My co-workers have been talking this place up for months, so I finally decided to check it out on my lunch break today. I will definitely be returning. Nestled into a tiny spot in Millvale, it would be easy to walk past if you weren't paying attention. It's super cute inside, with lots of fun tea related decor and a small dining area. The tea selection was huge, but I didn't dive into that area today since I was on my work lunch break. Service was prompt and the most friendly. I asked how spicy the chana masala was and was given a sample to try before I made my decision; the result being that it was just spicy enough for my tastes, so I went ahead. I wanted to try a cold tea but wasn't sure what; she was more than happy to pick through my tastes a bit before making some recommendations. I went with the cherry basil green tea and was not disappointed - she added just enough simple sugar to give it a hint of sweet without making it taste like -sweet tea- which was exactly what I was after. Food came out within minutes and was delicious. I definitely plan to make some trips back to buy some loose tea, and also to try the chickpea salad sandwich I saw on the menu!"}
