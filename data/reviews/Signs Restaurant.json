{"text":"Don't know how to explain the awesome experience we had. The concept is anyway heart touching but was really surprised with the quality of food. Best Lamb Shank I had in a long time"}
{"text":"Had dinner here recently and it was a good experience overall.  I liked the menus with the signs, the pictures with ASL gestures and the staff.  The menu however needs a lot of work--they don't have too many options and maybe 1-2 vegetarian options. Its also a confusing menu, thats not Italian, Indian or any particular cuisine. Its just random.   Dessert was okay, but they could improve on that as well. I felt the creativity was missing!"}
{"text":"We so wanted to love this place.  The welcome was great, our server was charming and helped us learn some basic signs.   The place was 1/3 full at 8pm on a midweek night and the atmosphere was a little stark. The menu was limited but we chose some basics. The food arrived promptly but was hugely disappointing.  The spring rolls were OK but generic. Probably the worst steak we'd ever been served (grey and waterlogged).  The seafood gnocchi was over salted and tasted of undiluted tomato paste.  The salads were limp and poorly dressed.  What a huge shame.  Let's hope this was the chef's night off."}
{"text":"The staff were really nice, and it was a really unique experience.  I was really shocked to find out that the food was good too.  If you and your friends want to try something different, this is a really fun place to go have a meal! :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Signs! My ASL (American Sign Language) is limited to the alphabet and a few words, but even if you knew no signs at all, the hosts are very helpful and hearing folk so they can speak with you and explain everything and handle the transition from them to your server, who is Deaf.  I say bring your patience and your willingness to learn. I went with a friend who knows a lot more sign than I do, but our server Julian was great and made sure his signs were very clear and was really patient with me too so don't worry if you're just learning for the first time. They have a little flip book with common signs to help you and at the very beginning your server teaches you how to sign yes, no, etc.  The food was SO GOOD! Seriously delicious, so you're not just going for the experience (though I imagine that is factored into the price).   Overall I had a fantastic time and would recommend that everyone check this place out at least once!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night after hearing about signs on the Internet. We only had 1 night in Toronto as we were traveling and we (a family of 5) were happy to eat here with the delicious food and friendly staff plus it was a fantastic idea to expose us to another language. While I had a little more practice in ASL my family found it to be a fun experience. I recommend to all."}
{"text":"Went there Tuesday night and the service was horrible. We were seated for 45 minutes before they took our food order. We were seeing a show two hours after we got there so we assumed it would be ample time but we were wrong. We had to ask for our bills with the food because service was so slow and I had to cancel a dessert because they forgot to put the order in and when they realized it was 8 minutes before the show was starting. This was a place I used to tell visiting friends about but I will not be doing that anymore."}
{"text":"amazing experience. Viktoria was a very gentle and patient waitress.  I suggest doing this first, and O.Noire. on a subsequent night."}
{"text":"Signs is just an average restaurant to me.   Decoration, food and service is average.    It is a good experience though if you want to learn some of the signs language.   I went with a voucher and still need to pay over $40 per person.   It is kind of expensive for an average restaurant.   And I don't like how they set up the bill.   First they group tax into an amount.  Then they put 15% tips on top of that amount.   Why is tips mandatory since we only have 2 people?   And why is it on top of tax?    That is the reason I give 3 stars instead of 4 stars."}
{"text":"Coming from an ASL interpreter and Deaf Education graduate student from Rochester NY who is fluent in ASL, I think the concept of this restaurant is fantastic. I was very happy to see a place for the Deaf community to come socialize and have a good time as well as educate the hearing community of Deaf Culture.  With that said, the service was quite poor. My boyfriend and I were going for apps and drinks. We drove 3 hours to have our order taken in spoken English by the hearing interpreter/waitress/hostess who made an excuse that our Deaf waitress was busy at the moment. The whole point of coming was to use sign! My boyfriend spent time to practicing his order in ASL and was excited to sign and then it was just written down like every other order. We would have been willing to wait for our waitress for the opportunity to use ASL. I was pretty upset about it but then again I converse in ASL every day. They didn't have the appetizer I ordered and the waitress brought out another one that was similar and told me that the previous app ran out. Granted, it was not the waitress's fault, but because it was wrong I would have thought it would have been taken off our bill or at least reduced. It was not.   Food tasted okay but the menu was all over the place. I think they should specialize in one kind of food and then perfect that instead of having a little Italian, Thai, American and everything in between.   Probably won't be back. Nothing special other than the Deaf Culture aspect."}
{"text":"Came here for a bday party and had a very pleasant time. It was such an fun experience to learn sign language. It was very helpful when the waiter and translator came to teach us basic sign language to order food and ask for assistance. \  I got the vegetarian zucchini noodle. It was my first time having vegetarian gluten-free noodles and it was fantastic! It was covered in a tomato sauce which made it really delicious. I didn't think I was going to get full from a vegetarian noodle dish, but I was surprisingly stuffed!  Although it was a bit more on the pricey side, but the food and service was worth the experience."}
{"text":"The food was quite good as were the drinks. My son and I both had a steak and fries. What put us over the top was learning some sign language and understanding the challenges faced."}
{"text":"We saw a video introducing this restaurant on a social media site and realized it is really close to where we live. We made a reservation right away for the next day. You will have to communicate with the servers in sign language.  During my visit it reminds me of O Noir, a restaurant close by where you dine in a pitch black environment. When comparing these 2 \"experience-based\" restaurant, I would say both experiences are quite unique on their own, but the food at Signs are definitely better.  The servers are all super nice and friendly! Will definitely go back one day and would recommend anyone to go try it!"}
{"text":"We came here with a table of 7, and we were all really impressed at the way everything turned out.   When you sit down, and the server is signing to you to introduce themselves, the menu, and the \"cheat sheet\" of signs (ie \"tastes good,\" \"too salty,\" \"water,\" etc), and there is an interpreter translating everything to get your started. We had a lot of fun learning how to use ASL, it was educational and fun and the group enjoyed practicing. Communicating with our server was not difficult, other than one time when my friend wanted to ask how many mussels come in the dish. However, the server ended up getting one of the interpreters, and it worked out fine.  The food was quite good! I had the chicken wings, which were meaty and not fatty at all. The Green Curry Mussels were good, but the dish was a bit on the small side. Maybe some more of the bread that came with it would have helped. The pasta was also good, but there was too much rapini in it which overpowered the rest of the dish. I can't remember what was said about the Venison Shepherd's pie, but I think they liked it.   This place is a novelty, and it would be a great stop since it's right downtown. I see myself coming here again, though probably not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went to Signs on a whim last night and we were pleasantly surprised. The entire experience was enjoyable. The service was much more friendly than your average restaurant. The concept is great. The staff are obviously excited to be there. And learning/ordering in ASL is a nice novelty. My friends and I have traveled a lot and it reminded us of ordering dinner somewhere where you don't know the language (but are enthusiastic to learn)... And the food was quite good!  Signs is certainly a \"gimmick\" restaurant but the food held up its end of the deal AND it's a very \"feel-good\" experience. I recommend it to anyone.  (Oh. And the manager is gorgeous!)"}
{"text":"So while I think that the concept behind the restaurant is an interesting idea and beneficial to those who use ASL, my experience was meh. I liked our waitress, she was very sweet and patient when we were trying to communicate with her.   The food was pretty good, but overpriced for the portion size. What really bugged me was the hostess/interpreter lady. From the second we got there, she was so snooty. When I asked for some help with my sign language since I've never used it before, she either scoffed or said \"Well, what do you THINK you do?\" and would give us eye rolls and smirks from afar.   It was also really frustrating when the interpreter was too busy rolling her eyes at customers to help them with sign language, so it took us a long time looking through the booklet to figure out how to sign something and found it hard to ask for something specific. It was okay, but I feel like this was more of a one time visit for me."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this restaurant and it did not disappoint! A friend and I came for Winterlicious and were greeted by friendly staff, one who spoke in sign language, and another that explained aloud what he was saying. The menu had ASL pictures for each menu item (e.g. Flatbread with bacon, mushroom and goat cheese would have \"flat\" and \"bread\" as the sign language), and it was such a great experience to try to learn to communicate using sign language! Our waiter, Julian was super encouraging and was always smiling and giving us a thumbs up after every attempt we made.   For a Sunday lunch, it was quite quiet and I really loved the overall ambiance of the place. The food was nothing too special, but it was satisfying. I ordered the flatbread (which was filling and flavourful), pork ravioli in alfredo (which was on the small side portion wise, but still good), and a chocolate cake (can never go wrong with that!). For $18 (+tax&gratuities), I would say it was pretty worth it.   Overall, I would definitely recommend coming to Signs (especially for Winterlicious) for the pleasant and unique experience!"}
{"text":"The real reason to visit this restaurant is for the experience. All staff here are hearing impaired to various degrees. In a complete role reversal from the norm outside the restaurant, guests inside the restaurant are expected to communicate, order, and ask questions in American Sign Language. There is a handy booklet that shows you how to speak the language using your hands and fingers. It is something everyone should try.  The food was tasty and the menu has a variety of interesting choices, but nothing to write home about. The price point is slightly higher than what I would expect. The service was friendly and efficient, and the ordering experience is something you have to experience yourself!   The restaurant is located near the Wellesley subway station and is a great place to come in small groups, for lunch or dinner.  I really enjoyed my visit to this restaurant. Truly one of its kind and kudos to the entrepreneur who worked hard to set it up. This was also one of the first restaurants in the area to be fully accessible and comply with the Province's standards on accessible public spaces.  ***The best part was when all the staff gathered around and sang me Happy Birthday in Sign.*** My eyes filled up in no time."}
{"text":"Went: 1:00 pm Sat May 3 2015 (7th date, 1st date as a couple) Ordered: do not recall Cost: incl. tax and tip $30-35 Comments: I am reviewing restaurants that I've been into in the last 3 months, but I'm forgetting the details. My apologies. I remember it being 4 star cuisine and being served by deaf waiters was unique, interesting, education and fun. This was the very first restaurant we went to after we decided two days before to be a couple. We had to clumsily sign what we wished to order though the instructions on the menus helped a lot. We wouldn't have minded staying longer and had to hurry through our food little to made sure we made it in time to see the musical Once which was nearby. Bottom line: One comes here for the deaf experience so I don't think I would go out of my way to come back with so many other options available, but I definitely wouldn't mind returning if invited."}
{"text":"Very friendly waiters ;) A great place to make your dinners more interesting by learning and using sign language to order and everything else you'd normally do at a restaurant. I think I made up some sign language too but for the meaning across ;)   Food is great too. Especially the cheese cake ;) so filling couldn't finish"}
{"text":"We went there for Our Anniversary Dinner. Good Food. Fabulous Service. Lovely Ambience. One could see the love and effort put into creating this amazing concept restaurant. We ordered two chicken items from their menu. I enjoyed the yummy \"Strawberry Daiquiri\" cocktail. Our Server was really nice. We had a fun conversation with the two girls from New York, who sitting right next to us on the other table. After the dinner we had an uplifting conversation with the owner. It was such an amazing experience for us. We even signed their guest book."}
{"text":"I too wish I could give a 3 1/2 star rating, three is a bit low, but it's not worthy of a four.  This is one of those places that you certainly must go for the experience of it.  We went to celebrate a friend's birthday, and upon arriving we were greeted by friendly and knowledgable staff, and as this was our first time there, they gave us the \"lo-down\" on ordering in \"sign\".   There were picture instructions on the menu to help us order, and the waiter was friendly and very helpful, and he would help coach us on our food order if we weren't able figure out the signs.  The decor was bright and contemporary, green seems to be a favorite color theme.  The food was flavorful, however, we found it quite pricey for the portion size.  The drinks were priced on the high side as well and they also already add a 15% gratuity right in your bill, so pay attention you don't \"double-tip\".  You'll I enjoy the experience of learning sign, but I think if you want more bang for the buck, somewhere a little less trendy would be better."}
{"text":"Such a unique and fun experience !   The host/ waitstaff are very pleasant and although you pretty much have to use a different language on the spot to order etc its actually a very seamless experience.   So ambience, experience- perfect.   Now just as importantly- the food is fantastic! We tried the penne, venison poutine, corn fritters and the muscles in green curry as well as the nutella tiramisu."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with my coworkers. None of us knew how to sign, but the staff and the cheat sheets made it fun and easy to learn. Everyone in the group really enjoyed the food and were very impressed with the atmosphere and service. We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Food quality is decent but really overpriced. Restaurant decor is simple and comfy. I didnt get a chance to order drinks so I wont be commenting on their price and quality. They do seem to be overstaffed as there were plenty of servers during my daytime visit but barely any customers! Also food took a while to arrive (we only ordered two plates).  Personally would recommend for a novel experience, But I wouldnt visit again. They seem more interested in serving those who use ASL. There are brochures on every table to assist you with understanding and learning signs but give me a break, I'm there to eat and relax, not learn a whole new method of communication. If i wanted that Id apply for an ASL course. Really tedious. Especially seeing as how our server got slightly offended when we chose to point at our menu choice instead of fully communicating through sign language...  Dont get me wrong, I appreciate what theyre doing for the deaf community by employing them and helping them make a decent honest living.   BUT This restaurant just aint my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Knowing ASL I HAD to try out this restaurant while visiting Toronto! Don't worry you don't need to know a single word of sign to eat at this restaurant, they make things very easy for you with pictures of the signs on the menus, a \"cheat sheet,\" or if your desperate the hostess doubles as your interpreter. The wait staff are very friendly and more than willing to work with your communication skills so don't let the \"deaf thing\" be a barrier for you. My friend who I was with doesn't know ASL and got along just fine.  I do wish they had more of a lunch menu since I was there during the day but the food was very good. They also have a large drink menu of about any cocktail, shooter, or beer you want.  They ask that you not take pictures of the menu or cheat sheet (not sure why). Guess you will have to see it for yourself!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had an incredible time at Signs. We had a great waiter and enjoyed learning the signs to advise of our order.   The food was absolutely delicious. The veal chops were flavorful and tasty and the jerk chicken gnocchi was incredible! The gnocchi seasoning was on point (beware it is spicy).   Definitely will come back here and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Great experience great food! Our server was so nice and very patient  and kind!  Would eat Here again. We did not have to make a reservation but it would be a good. Idea of you wanted to say at 7."}
{"text":"My wife and I went because of the neat back story. We ended up with a great meal. The service was fantastic. The Thai chicken burger was well thought out. I had the split pea soup and it wasn't the normal soup. It was a nice take on a classic. My wife had a delicious grilled cheese.  The restaurant was clean and inviting. Bathrooms were also clean."}
{"text":"The experience was different but very enjoyable. The food was really delicious. We ordered the NY steak and butternut squash ravioli, the steak was very nicely done and tasty. The ravioli was nothing to write home about though. We also had the mac and cheese bites which was a new experience but really good. For dessert the cheesecake was smooth and the perfect way to end the meal.  Our waitress was friendly and patient with us. She did the best to understand us and make us feel comfortable and welcome."}
{"text":"Eating at Signs Restaurant was a great learning experience for myself and my 12-year-old son.  We are both very grateful to have had the experience and hope to find others like it when we return home.    Reservation & Service:  We had a 7 PM reservation (on Canada Day/Pride Day no less), arrived 20 minutes early and was seated immediately.  The hostess communicated verbally and in ASL.  She was very welcoming and immediately made us feel at ease while supplying us with menus and an ASL cheat sheet.  Our waitress was phenomenal.  She quickly taught us a few basics in ASL - yes, no, thank you, & finished.  She even kicked it up a notch by teaching us mahi mahi, & caesar salad is ASL & waited patiently as I fumbled through the cheat sheet to communicate with her using other terms.    The Food:  The carrot soup was delicious.  However, it wasn't as hot as I would have liked it to be.  This seemed to be a trend throughout the meal.  It didn't detract from the experience, but it was enough for me to notice it.  The caesar salad was deliciously crisp and tangy.  The mahi mahi was seasoned with a rub my palate didn't care for.  For me, it was too salty and had an overwhelming cardamom or cumin flavor (neither of which I like).  The mahi mahi sits on 2 large slices of grilled sweet potatoes and baby bok choy in coconut pineapple sauce (tastes like piña colada).  Although I loved everything but the rub, the kitchen prepared a new fresh plate sans the rub and all was right in my world.  My son order the veal chop and couldn't devour it fast enough.  He truly enjoyed it.  I had to stop him from sliding his finger across the plate and licking it.  For dessert my son had the mango sorbet which he reports had a creamy texture and a decadent flavor.  I had the chocolate avalanche.  If you like chocolate, you will like this moist, triple chocolate dessert appointed with fresh blueberries.    Payment:  Paying was easy & efficient.  There was a tax (no fault of the restaurant, that's just Canada) which was nearly $10.00 for a $70.00 meal (we chose from the prix fix menu).    Miscellaneous:  The bathrooms were spotless.  They offer daily drink specials.  They do not have an open kitchen."}
{"text":"Great service and a very fun experience. The servers try to teach you some basic sign languages while you place your orders. Surprisingly the food was a lot better than I expected. I ordered the squash ravioli which was perfectly seasoned. The NY steak was very tender and juicy! Noms!!"}
{"text":"Isn't it interesting that it's hard to search this restaurant on Yelp? Type in \"Signs\" and you get sign shops...type in \"Signs Restaurant\" and that doesn't help either. Sigh... but I digress  I was excited to eat at this place as soon as I heard about it, especially as I had been to O Noir in Montreal and enjoyed the experience. Was apprehensive about its popularity as there was no availability on OpenTable, but I chanced the walk-in anyway and it was actually mostly empty. No problem finding a table even though I was asked if I had a reservation and dejectedly admitted \"no\". That was not a problem though! Plenty of empty tables.  Concept is interesting. The maitre d' can speak and when your actual waiter arrives, she translates the introductory remarks of the waiter who is signing. Our waiter was able to vocalize a bit so even if I didn't process the sign, I could make out what he was saying and when he was repeating back what I was trying to say, I could verify just based on what I had heard. Sort of like dining in a foreign country where you don't speak the language.  What was helpful was the menu and the cheat sheets (which they asked respectfully not to photograph, knowing that many of their clientele would be photogs - yet tsk tsk there are photos of them on Yelp!).   I think the experience as far as signing is what you make of it. This is a great place for those fluent in ASL to feel at home, and for the rest of us to experience a new perspective.  The food was decent but by dish wasn't great - parts of the Deer Shepherd's Pie was cold, but when I took a few more bites to figure out if I wanted to complain, I didn't hit any more cold parts, so whatever.   I love the concept. Hope they are able to keep improving and get more people coming back as it's in a pretty good location!"}
{"text":"I think Signs is a wonderful concept and am so happy to see that a place like this exists in Toronto. Our server was wonderful (I wish I could remember her name!) and everyone seemed generally happy to be working there. It's a positive, progressive environment but I do think there is some room for improvement. I didn't like the hostess (who could hear). She told us we weren't allowed to be seated early when we arrived before our reserved time and my friend and I didn't realize at first she was joking. I've worked in customer service and think it's unprofessional to be sarcastic with people you're greeting and have no prior relationship with. I also felt that the prices were a bit high for the quality of the food (my pasta, for instance, was cold). It seems more like the type of place you go for the novelty experience and to support to ASL community rather than enjoy an exceptional meal. Signs, however, has such a commendable mission that I felt really terrible requesting they heat up my dish and even deliberated writing this review but if the food improved this restaurant would truly be out of this world.  Also, I believe they have the best customer service of any restaurant I've recently been to in Toronto (excluding the hostess). Our server even wrote an apology about the food being cold on my bill.  I wish Signs the best of luck in the future."}
{"text":"Right off the bat I thought this was a very awesome concept that could either be really fun and educational, or a complete disaster. Good news! This is an amazing success of a restaurant concept.   Upon walking in the door one of the deaf waitstaff greets you waving hi, and you're not sure how to respond so you wave back. Once seated, you're introduced to your waiter/waitress by the one of 2(?) employees who is not completely deaf. The menu features instructions on how to order, and they provide an instructional \"cheat sheet\" book to help with conversational phrases you'd use during the meal to interact with the wait staff. It seems they cover everything in order to prepare diners to have an enjoyable time, and also learn a thing or two.   I imagine that any of the deaf waitstaff must have some level of humor they approach this with, or else working for this restaurant would be quite tough. Well, I learned when I made a bit of an obscene gesture to the waitress that they most certainly do have a sense of humor. I chuckled with her, but still felt a little embarrassed.  All else aside, the food was just amazing. It tasted, looked, and smelled awesome. The prices also cannot be beat for the experience, and quality of the food you are getting.  I would say that you should not be shy, or nervous about giving this a try. You won't regret going, and what's the worst that could happen, you say some obscene to your waitress?"}
{"text":"Nice place with good food and friendly staff. Clean and well maintained. The only thing is that the portions are small. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"We made the trip from Florida, USA primarily to go to this restaurant because my daughter is an American Sign Language (ASL) honor student. We were impressed by everything; from the décor to the friendliness of the staff, to the quality of the food. The menu was diverse and includes all visual aids to assist you in communicating with the wait staff. The story of how this restaurant came to be was inspiring and they really have done a wonderful job at bridging the communication and comfort gap in conversing with people who are deaf or hard of hearing. I'd petition for a restaurant of this nature and caliber to be in every large city in the US. It has a bigger purpose than filling your belly. The food was delicious, well-prepared and beautifully plated. Our waitress was friendly, engaging and shared a great sense of humor. The class of service was higher end; lemon-infused water in small pitchers, butter on plates, etc. We loved everything about this place....A++"}
{"text":"If you don't go for the food (which is awesome) then go for the experience! Seven of us went for a family dinner (3-10 year olds included) and all had fun and all were pleased with their food. Lamb shank was juicy and tender, butternut squash ravioli was very flavorful and had tons of mushrooms. Duck confit poutine was delish. We shared two desserts which were also outstanding and creative. Doing the sign language thing was a great experience and it maybe took a few extra minutes to order, but overall the it was fun and memorable. We will definitely recommend to people who visit Toronto and return if we come back here!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great ambiance, friendly staff, and a very educational experience to boot!  Highly recommended!  Loved the innovative chickpea fries."}
{"text":"Last night I came here with a friend and we had a really great time.  The waiter teaches you some common sign language as soon as he/she greets you.  I have two food allergies so I had to cheat a little bit to order.  I may have typed my questions onto my iPhone's notepad to make sure my dish was both lactose and gluten free.  The waiters were very patient and they all had huge smiles on their faces.  The food was really good and the restaurant offers different specials each day.  The specials are of great value and they tasted delicious. We really enjoyed our experience and even asked the staff to get in a group photo with us.  They were more than happy to oblige.  It was really fun to learn a new language in a fun and positive atmosphere.  I wish I knew sign language better so I could speak with the waiters better but we had an awesome time.  This was definitely an experience and I would definitely go back with other friends.  I ordered the Prime Rib Eye and they were able to accommodate my diet.  They subbed the mash potatoes with fries and brought me more vegetables.  Allover I was really happy with the experience.  My friend had a great time too and she loved her dish as well.  I think she ordered the chicken panini.  It's a great experience that I recommend for anyone. :)"}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant. The servers are all deaf, and so the uniqueness of this restaurant rests in the way it brings the diner into this world. Introductions to the meal are handled by hearing staff. Each table has a sign language book on it, and so, one learns to order using sign language! It was quite an education, and a lot of fun. The food itself was quite good. Flavourful, and hot and fresh. Loved my chocolate brownie for dessert. Most importantly, I think it is really important for all of us to step into the shoes of others, if only for a meal. This was a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"So glad we had the opportunity to dine in.  Our server Amanda was friendly as were the other staff we met. Enjoyed my time chatting with them!  We ordered the butter chicken and the butternut squash ravioli with chicken. Both entrees were delicious...we returned our plates empty. Great decor and a wonderful experience if you do or don't know sign. Again, I'm so glad we heard about Signs before our visit to Toronto was over."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dinner here this week with a group of 8 people in total. The entire experience was great and a lot of fun. Since my in-laws are both deaf, I actually have a little experience with signing, however the staff really made an effort to make everyone comfortable who had never used sign language before. Our waiter was really friendly and super patient when everyone tried to order their food in ASL. I ordered the Butter Chicken Poutine and it was delicious!  Everyone else, including the kids, loved their food as well.   Can't wait to come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Food: 6/10 -- Value: 5/10 -- Service: 9/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 8/10  Would I come back? No.   Signs is a really average restaurant; average because the service is pretty good and the food is not.   We went for our office lunch this past Tuesday, and our waiter, an Asian female (sorry! I forget her name), was really great. She was so patient when people were slowly - and I mean s...l...o...w...l...y - spelling things out in sign language and she was incredibly quick and proactive with drink refills.  The prices aren't pretty. I guess you could said you're paying for the experience, but it isn't nearly as immersive or noticeable as O.Noir (where you eat in a pitch dark room). While it might seem like you can't compare the two, they are comparable in price. It's $40 for a three-course meal at O.Noir and for an equivalent appetizer/main/dessert combination at Signs, you'd have to pay $40 as well. I guess with Signs, you don't HAVE to get a three-course meal.   You don't interact with the waiters much. You pretty much only have to sign when you order. They'll refill your drinks with a nod of your head and the bill is pretty self-explanatory. Because of this minimal interaction, it doesn't feel like as much of an experience. While the experience of O.Noir is essentially 95% gimmick, 5% food, Signs is more like 60% gimmick, 40% food because as customers, we still have access to all our senses and it feels almost like a regular meal.  So food is important and the quality is just not there.  My burger and fries ($15) was more like a large bun with a side of desert patty. It was so dry and the bread to meat ratio was way off. I don't really like how they give you ketchup in tiny little metal shot glasses as opposed to the bottle because you're gonna need more than one of those to accompany your plate of dehydration. As a portion, the burger and fries were quite filling.   Since its opening a little over a year ago, it's clear that Signs still struggles to find a balance between good food and good value. The menu has barely changed over the last year (has it changed at all?) and the lack of variety is only highlighted by how it doesn't seem like they differentiate between lunch and dinner. As it stands, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant - for the food or the fleeting \"experience\"."}
{"text":"A little on the pricier side, but the food was delicious. My bf got the lamb shank and I got the venison shepherd's pie. Both were hearty and delicious. It was eye opening to see the culture and atmosphere brought through asl, and how everyone is so nice and cooperative."}
{"text":"Overall we enjoyed the experience, it's challenging to communicate by signs and it's interesting to have the opportunity to acknowledge . It was our first stroll in the area, we dislike Yonge St , the restaurant is clean and full of light, it looks like modern fast food chain. The staff was super nice and we feel very comfortable. The food was average, the sliders overlooked , the spring rolls were nice, the beer was refreshing."}
{"text":"Interesting place to try for dinner. Their food was actually pretty good. Took my family here for my birthday dinner. All the menus have sign language instructions and there are pamphlets on the table that teach you how to say basic phrases like thank you, more water, everything is great. The server was super enthusiastic and had the biggest smile in the entire world. Just makes you want to smile too. The lamb was probably the best dish of all the different ones we tried. We also order salmon and chicken pot pie.   Response time is a bit lagging here though. Takes a bit of time to get water and also our food. Would be great if the menu had a three course option too. Ambiance is average here."}
{"text":"We happened upon this restaurant purely by chance as our choice of restaurant was somehow closed for lunch.  We were quickly scoping out an alternative when we opted for Signs based on the posted special lunch menu.  We did not know the concept of the dining experience until we saw the menu and the hostess began explaining to us!  Overall, we were very glad we dined here for lunch.  Our server was very sweet and friendly, always smiling and patient as we eagerly stumbled with our ASL.  I enjoyed my grilled chicken and side mixed greens salad.  What a nice twist on the bun, a sort of wrap/panini/flatbread fusion!  My husband ordered the pork belly kimchi sandwich with fries.  He was a bit put off by the sour vinegar taste in the kimchi though.  Our friend ordered one of the lunch specials, the fish and shrimp pad thai, it looked delectable and she very much enjoyed it.  We had a very pleasant lunch with quick and courteous service.  Restaurant had classy decor as well.  Would recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a unique place to eat the last time I was in Toronto and ended up at Signs. I have to say I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. Let me start by saying I know absolutely no sign language. Despite the fact that I didn't know any, everything went off without a hitch. We were seated by is speaking/hearing hostess who explained how the process works and introduced us to our server. Our server came out with a smile so big that it would have been impossible for it not to be infectious.  With the use of the cheat sheets and the run through you are given at the beginning of your expirience, ordering went great. It was very unique to be in a situation not knowing how to communicate, it started a wonderful conversation between my wife and I. moving on to the most important part of any restaurant... The food! We enjoyed the duck poutine and the pork sliders in an attempt to have a light lunch. The duck poutine was delicious and perfectly balanced. The sliders while also delicious, were a little smaller then I would have hoped, even for a slider. The vibe had a pretty modern feel to it, very clean with bold colors. I would certainly come back and have a full meal. I would also highly recommend it for a date night or a unique place to go with friends."}
{"text":"Such a fun, enlightening experience.  I originally heard of this restaurant via Facebook and couldn't wait to venture here on my latest trip to Toronto.   The service is impeccable- friendly, inviting, and helpful. When it comes to learning to sign, they are patient and sweet.  I ordered the poutine, which was phenomenal as poutines should be :P as well as the butternut squash ravioli.  While the pasta was tasty, I felt the oil was a bit much and would have perhaps preferred a cream based sauce instead.  Other than that, I had 0 complaints.   We dined in at around 10:30pm on a Saturday night, and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. I hope it has busier hours during the day and it stays open!  Such a refreshing way to dine. I would recommend to all and would definitely venture back when I revisit Toronto."}
{"text":"Simply amazing , the staff are super friendly , unqie experience great food. the butternut squash  ravioli was amazing. I had so much fun here you have to drop by"}
{"text":"Totally an over-all great experience! Super gentle, warm and friendly from walking through the door to the last bite and farewell. Speaking staff explained how the experience would be and the Deaf staff were gentle and kind and helpful. Amazing to have an experience that reverses the way we interact. Offering immersion into a unique culture. The homemade bread is amazing as well as the variety of the menu. Super cool, to learn signs with the various 2-D images. Such diversity in ethnicity too. An over-all refreshing experience. I wish them the best to come for years on end. We are all one!"}
{"text":"Ein sehr gutes Restaurant mit einem außergewöhnlichem Konzept: Alle Kellner und Köche sind gehörlos. Man bekommt eine kurze Einführung in die englische Gebärdensprache und danach kann man die Bestellung in Gebärdensprache aufgeben. Ein sehr interessantes Konzept, dass es auch in anderen Ländern geben sollte. Ich hatte den Burger und kann ihn sehr empfehlen. Frisch zubereitet, keine gefrorenen Patties. Auch die Poutine war sehr gut. Wir kommen sicherlich wieder."}
{"text":"This is a must go!!!  I first heard about Signs on Tumblr. I was so happy that there is a restaurant for people who are deaf because this is an amazing opportunity to provide more jobs.   This was the best experience ever. My friend and I have dined in a month ago and once you enter the restaurant, you are greeted with American Sign Language and a translator. All the workers are very welcoming and definitely gave the best customer service at any restaurant I had ever been to.   There are very cute little booklets that guide your way through on how to use ASL. The waitors/waitresses are understanding if customers are a bit slow learning. They check up with you if everything is going well. Our waitress was very outstanding, she deserved the big tip. The restaurant is also in a LGBTQ area in Toronto so everyone is always welcomed in.   The food was absolutely amazing for a great price. I ordered a Potato Crusted Salmon and it was beyond what I was expected.  The crispy wings appetizer was also amazing, maybe because chicken is always the best. The menu also had many options like  Vegetarian, Gluten-free, and Lactose-free etc.   Bathrooms were also very clean. Worth going more than once!  Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant with some friends last weekend. It was a great concept and the food was good too. I'm not into \"foodie\" food with weird ingredients, so I liked the more traditional approach. This place is very good about food allergies and were able to accommodate my gluten issue. They had many gluten free options available.  There was a hosting who was hearing that introduced us to our server. Our server was really kind and patient. He helped teach us how to sign the things that we wanted to order. Everything we ordered came as expected.  The food was great and the experience made me appreciate the difficulty and beauty of sign language. I recommend going to this place if you want dinner with a twist!"}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-4 Service-5 Food-5 Strikeouts-0/3  I came in here with low expectations with the food, since this restaurant was all about the experience to communicate with the staff. We ordered two virgin cocktails, a casear, and chocolate banana milkshake I believe? Forgot the exact name. Also ordered Escargots, veal chops and two desserts.  First off, the whole experience with the wait staff was fun, especially since they can't communicate verbally, you are forced to learn through diagrams throughout the menus. It was fun for my girlfriend and I. This alone made it worth the trip. I definitely wouldn't order the escargots, it was pretty terrible, but the garlic bread was amazing. The best part was the veal chop, amazingly well done, and honestly tasted more like a giant beef steak or something. It was unreal how good this veal was. Definitely highlight of my day in terms of food, and it came as a surprise too.   The dessert we got was the chocolate raspberry mouse and the NYC cheesecake. Cheesecake was better than average, not too strong of a flavour, but still heavy as a cheesecake. The mouse was definitely spot on good though. It wasn't fluffy too the point it was eating a marshmallow, but  fluffy enough to be a mousse! All in all, definitely suggest people to come here at least once to try. This may not be a place to come back over and over again, but it was definitely a good experience. They also have groupons available time to time, so check that out too."}
{"text":"Like many others, we wanted to try this place for a new unique experience, and hopefully learn some ASL.   The staff are wonderful, majority are deaf but when you first come in, there is someone who can help start you off with communicating properly with the staff which was really helpful. There is a sheet on the table that has the basic signs you need to know, and on the menu it shows you how to order using ASL.   Atmosphere was quite empty. Decor was simple, clean, and inviting.   Prices are quite expensive for the quality and portion sizes.  Appetizer I had the veggie spring rolls with an apple mint chutney. For main I had the grilled veal chop with garlic mash, sauteed veggies and a demi glace. For dessert I had a chocolate fudge cake with berries and a raspberry drizzle.   Overall, I thought the food was just ok. There wasn't much going on in terms of flavour, some things could use more umf, more seasoning. Didn't like the apple mint chutney at all...it had a strange papery texture to it. It tasted premaid, frozen and so did the spring rolls. The veal was decent though, everything else was just ok.   Service was good, the staff were patient when we were ordering in ASL for the first time. They came around often to check if we needed anything.   Overall, it's a nice place if you want a new and unique restaurant experience, but the food quality could use some improvement."}
{"text":"My visit to Signs was one of the most interesting parts of my trip to Toronto. I was a little nervous when my friend suggested going here as I had no idea what to expect but I'm so glad that I did.  As others have mentioned, all of the servers here are deaf. This means all ordering and conversation with staff is done using sign language. To start your meal, the host joins your server and the table to introduce them and teach you some basic signs to get things started (yes, no, thank you, etc.). They also let you know that unlike most other restaurants, it isn't rude to put up your hand here if you need something.  In addition to the initial introduction, there are also helpful conversational guides on every table and all of the menu items are accompanied by instructions for how to sign them. All of the servers are equipped with tablets so when you try signing your order, they can confirm with you that they understood by showing you a picture of it. It was a very humbling experience being put in the position where you're struggling to communicate in the dominant form. That in itself was worth the visit.   Aside from the unique dining experience offered at Signs, the food is actually really good! As a vegetarian I was blown away by the number of creative choices that were clearly marked on the menu. There is a great selection of vegan and gluten-free dishes as well. The butternut squash ravioli was delicious and I also really enjoyed my lychee martini. This seems like it would be a cool place to come back for a drink at the bar."}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service. A must go. I had the piri piri chicken & was spellbound. It was one of the best food I had in a long long time!!! Will definitely recommend it to people who have not tried it yet"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. Yes, it's a gimmick/novelty, but it's a great one, one that should be adapted and opened all over the world, as there are many different versions of sign language. I heard about this place on a social media site and when I came to Toronto it was one of the things I knew I had to do. I went with a German girl I met in the hostel I was staying at, and the staff, both hearing and Deaf, were extremely helpful.  I knew a bit of fingerspelling before coming, so I was able to introduce myself and my friend to the waiter, who was incredibly friendly and nice.   The images to help you order, and make interacting with the servers was, and even though I didn't know much, I was able to order pop and dessert with little issue.  I will definitely make it a point to eat here every time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have been here 2 times now and it the experience is great. The staff are really patient and fun to teach you ASL. The food during both my visits was excellent. I had a salmon pasta during my first visit and the second time was a squash ravioli. I hope their menu continues to grow!"}
{"text":"Signs is an interesting restaurant where guests can learn about American Sign Language.   I walked in and was greeted by friendly staff, one already speaking to me in sign language. I let her know that I made a reservation under Kristy and after searching for like 3 minutes, she could not find my name and seated me on the opposite side. Next thing I knew, my friend was already inside at our table.  The menu is super cute as all of the food items had illustrations of ASL actions that you will need to do when you order. We learned how to say water and everything we ordered to our waitress who was really friendly and took her time to show us how to do the actions. Unfortunately pictures of the menu is not allowed. The portions were rather large at SIGNS. I loved one of their seafood items on the menu, though I felt like a lot of the food can be much more warm than what we had.  Comparing it to O'Noir, for the blind, i felt like Signs was less of an experience because we were allowed to talk, which sort of limited the feeling. Maybe they should implement a no talking rule to REALLY get guests into the experience."}
{"text":"After reading an article about Signs coming to Toronto, I've been wanting to try it since.    Signs is a unique dining experience where guests can learn more about American Sign Language  (ASL)  by attempting and succeeding to order food items by using the language as well as to interact with deaf servers through simple phrases.  The staff at Signs are very patient and welcoming and are attentive to everyone's needs. The hostess guided our family through using the menus - each food item has diagrams that illustrate how to sign them in ASL to the server. At every table is more sheets, a \"cheat book\", to learn phrases to help you throughout your dining experience - the ASL alphabet, phrases such as \"thank you\" and \"one bill please\", etc... It was a great and fun learning experience for me and my family - we all loved learning more about ASL, trying it out, and helping each other learn the signs.   For food, we ordered:  Appetizer: Korean BBQ Wings ($14)... were okay. They were a bit salty and had a soggy feel to them. They came with a side of kimchi which added a sour countertaste to the chicken flavour. I wouldn't recommend them as apps.   Mains:  Grilled Chicken Panini ($15)... this was one of our favourite dishes. We would give it a 4/5... a good sandwich stuffed with chicken breast, lettuce, tomatoes, bacon, mayo, and served with either soup, salad, or fries - my mom chose fries. The fries were good too - reminded us of Costco fries. I'd definitely recommend this sandwich!  Butternut squash ravioli ($19)... this was a pretty yummy dish. I liked the ingredients and toppings mixed in - pecans, cheese, sage, and mushrooms. It had a bit too much olive oil tossed with it but the flavours were good. Not the best butternut squash ravioli I've had but delicious nonetheless. A recommend.   Miso Salmon ($26)... grilled salmon served on a bed of risotto. We were actually disappointed with this one - which we didn't expect to be. We love salmon but we didn't find ourselves agreeing with the flavours and textures in this dish. Salmon was soft and tender - not well done but light pink and juicy (which I prefer) but didn't go well with the mushy risotto and the flavours were bland. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this dish - especially at their asking price.   Pad thai ($18 but if you want either chicken or shrimp, you have to add $5 each)...we ordered three plain pad thai because a few of us were craving it. For the most part, it was good pad thai - the flavours were mostly spot on - not the best we've had but good - 3/5. Only downside is that all dishes needed more sauce. They were all on the dry side. Portions were big but, again, at the price you're paying, you can get a lot more pad thai someplace else.   Overall, we'd rate the food a 2/5 and the experience 5/5. What you're coming here for is the experience - something nothing else in Canada offers. While the food unfortunately lacks in quality, the ambience and the people here more than make up for it. We enjoyed our stay - we got the chance to learn more about ASL and what Signs is doing is innovative - Signs is a restaurant that provides deaf people a workspace that wouldn't normally be open to them while, at the same time, giving non-deaf people a chance to learn more about ASL as well as a chance for deaf people to order in ASL."}
{"text":"Really great food. I had the noodles with clams and my fiancée had the chicken on flat bread with a poutine. Both were wonderfully fresh and delicious.  The wait staff are so sweet. I love how you are encouraged to sign all of the dishes as per the menu to the staff as they are deaf. When the food is being cooked they come over and ask if you would like to learn more sign. I will come back again and again. The prices are great. My meal was $14 and my fiancée was similar. For a place like this I would expect a much larger cost."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to try if you're in Toronto!  Seeing how close I work to the place, I figured this would be a good a time as ever to head over.  I knew beforehand that the restaurant employed deaf waitresses, so I wanted to learn a bit of ASL before I got there. I learned the greetings I thought I would need, pleasantries, and the order I wanted.    It's one thing to know what want to say beforehand, but actually putting it to use was a lot more difficult than I expected.  I was greeted by a young lady who (thankfully) welcomed me in both english and ASL at the same time.  She led me to my seat, explained how the process went and introduced me to my waiter.  The hostess-now translator asked me to follow my waitress in learning a few of the signs possibly needed for my stay.  Also provided was a small booklet that included many more things such as pleasantries (thank goodness, I forgot all of them already!), responses and many other things.  In the end I ordered the butternut squash ravioli as they didn't have the fish and chips that I saw on the yelp photos album (that dish is only served under certain days apparently).    Now my experience with Italain Cuisine(?) is not as comprehensive as my Asian cuisine, but I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  It was a nice blend of sweet and savory, and for what I thought to be a small portion, I was actually filled quite nicely. The fried basil leaves and walnuts added a beautiful difference in texture, and it was quite an interesting plate!  At one point I decided to research how to sign 'dessert', and I guess the waitress saw me attempting it and brought it over the menu anyways! She was a very attentive and very nice waitress.  Unfortunately I ran out of lunch time and let my waiter know I was in a hurry and I needed the cheque (both phrases provided in the book).  At the end of the day I was extremely satisfied with my meal there, and would definitely come back again.  This is a place that does the community some good, while producing top notch service and excellent food."}
{"text":"Came on a weeknight and used a Groupon.   I was disappointed when we were given a Groupon only menu. If the voucher originally states that there will be a limited menu, I have no issue and understand completely why a restaurant would do that. However this came as a surprise. I had already checked out the regular menu online and narrowed down to a couple choices - neither of them were on the limited menu.   The hostess (not hearing impaired) explained how the restaurant works and demonstrated a couple phrases in sign.  On each table is a flip chart of various terms and how to sign them, as well as a cheat sheet with words you can point to - e.g. \"no\" \"extra\" \"on the side\" along with various condiments.  We didn't get to communicate too much in sign with our server, mostly I think because we felt nervous we wouldn't do it right but we did say a couple standard things like \"thank you\" \"it was good\" etc.    We saw 2 waitresses and the hostess interact using sign, which was interesting.   For apps, we got the Caesar salad and ginger carrot soup. No complaints, both were exactly how you'd expect them to be.  For the mains, we got the seafood gnocchi and vegetable pasta. The tomato sauce used in both was really flavourful and tasty. I expected the vegetable pasta to be regular linguine with vegetables thrown in. Instead, the \"pasta\" itself was spiraled carrots. Not being a huge fan of carrots, this was well made I guess but tasted too healthy for me. Menu should have clarified it wasn't real pasta.   For dessert, we both had the chocolate cake which was rich, without too much ganache."}
{"text":"If I could give more that 5 stars I would. My friend and I had heard about this restaurant through facebook about a year ago and as soon as we did we started planning a trip to go. They completely exceeded our expectations. We already knew a lot of sign language and could communicate easily with our server JULIAN (who was AMAZING). The food was great, we both got steaks (the sauce that comes on it is SO GOOD) that came with a side of fries and veggies. Overall a great experience and we will be returning as soon as we are in the area again.  The girls up at the front are super sweet and they let us put a pin in the map by the host desk!"}
{"text":"I tried the butter chicken for 13 bucks and it was so-so, but the experience is very unique and exciting. The waiters are friendly and very patient with customers who have no prior knowledge of ASL. Don't take pics of their cheat sheet though, it's trademarked."}
{"text":"Good: - unique experience - overall concept - service  Meh: - it's a quiet place (for obvious reasons) but the space has too much empty space for a quiet place ... made it eery at times  Bad: - Food and the time it took to get the food  Seriously, the food was disappointing. Had the noodle pork, friend had (very salty and smelly) mussels, sheppard's pie ... all of us were very disappointed. Yes, it's a unique place, but they need a better chef.  Last, it took ages to get the food and the place wasn't packed. Pity."}
{"text":"Got a travelzoo deal which made the dinner that much better. App, main and desert. Wait staff was friendly and you get to learn sign language. Food is tasty. Its a must try."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience. We honestly didn't go for the food but rather the experience and it made me so happy to see my bf so engaged and learning all he could from the menu, cheat sheet and server. The food was DELICIOUS and portions large. The spring rolls were not very oily which I loved, my bf throughly enjoyed his ceasar salad with bits of bacon pieces nestled under pieces of crisp fresh leaves.  The vegetable noodles tasted amazing and was covered in a tasty tomato sauce. My Veal chop with mash potatoes and sauted veggies were flavourful and meshed well together. Drinks were a tad bit hit or miss. Beer wasn't very cold, Long Island ice tea was all lime (had bought a Coke and added it to it, but sadly couldn't salvage it...lol)... the fairy blood was exceptional and we will be having it again on our next visit. I saved the best for last... the chocolate cake was magic, my taste buds were doing a little dance as I bit into the light moist morsel. Absolutely fantastic end to our meal and I don't generally give such high praise. Our server was wonderful and patient, enjoying teaching us the many signs etc. She was fast and thoughtful. We left a 50% tip which we both felt was well deserved by the staff. Lovely experience, we will be back."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. Such an eye opener. The food was amazing and the staff were even more incredible. We take so much in life for granted, this is a good way to sit back and appreciate so much more!"}
{"text":"I rarely write a bad review, but if it's bad, it's bad. I went to Signs by recommendation of a co-worker while visiting Toronto. My expectation was that I would have an interactive dinning experience, and that is exactly what I got. The food was mediocre at best, decor was tacky, but all those things aside this review could have had four stars, had the wait staff not been so incredibly unprofessional. When dinning in a restaurant I am sure there are things that happen behind the doors of the kitchen that are busy and loud; orders that need to occur quickly to satisfy a customer. As a patron, I expect that I never know about those issues, and that was not the case during my experience at Signs. Three servers running quickly back and forth near our table during our entire meal who were yelling and arguing about responsibilities was so distracting that my husband and I could not carry on a conversation without redirecting our focus back to the waitstaff. I would certainly not return and would not recommend this establishment to a friend or family member."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant, it was a wonderful experience!!  The staff here were very friendly and welcoming, always smiling :) :) My first time here, we came here for their Winterlicious menu, which was $25 for the 3 course meal. We had a brief introduction from the staff and were given cheat sheet cards. Everything on the menu had images on how to sign your order to the server.   For appetizers, ordered the carrot soup and spring rolls. Main courses were veal chop and mahi mahi. And for dessert, chocolate cake and crepe. The food was delicious, tasted fresh and as expected. I have no complaints, loved the chocolate cake dessert.  The restaurant was large, clean, spacious and beautifully decorated with ASL framed signs all over the wall. The atmosphere is calmly quiet and slightly formal for dinner. They were quite busy that night... We waited a while (over 40mins) for our food, and for the bill, but during the wait times we practiced ASL.  Overall, I enjoyed it - a fun unique way to learn sign language."}
{"text":"I think the concept is really great.  I wanted to try it since I had been to O'Noir (similar concept but with blind servers and you eat in the dark).  I didn't get quite the experience that I hoped for because it was a bit easier to get away with not signing a lot.  As you're making an attempt to sign  your food, the server can already guess what you're trying to say.  The menu itself has some interesting items.  They have daily specials as well.  I had a potato soup - very tasty.  And the venison shepard's pie.  I was a bit disappointed with the shepard's pie. It was cold or warm in a lot of parts.  It was mostly mashed potato, with a small layer of venison and some canned corn.  The pumpkin creme brule was great though.  Nice, simply decor.    Unfortunately I wasn't able to learn that much American Sign Language.  Talking with the server seemed to go so quickly.  I felt it difficult to try to figure out what I'm doing with my hands while also looking up at the server.  The only thing I could really remember was \"thank you\"."}
{"text":"I came here recently as I had a groupon for $86 for two (includes an appetizer, entree, dessert and a drink up to $8 worth). The experience was incredibly unique and interesting. There are cheat sheets on the table so don't worry if you don't know ASL. TBH you only really use ASL to order the food. The service was impeccable - our server was extremely patient and made us feel very welcome!   Unfortunately, the food was mediocre at best. We ordered the Caesar salad for appetizers and it was overly soaked in dressing. I ordered the steak medium rare which came with french fries and vegetables. The french fries were soft and not crispy at all, whereas the vegetables were plain and lacked flavour. The steak was however delicious and cooked to perfection. My date ordered the Mahi Mahi fish which also lacked flavour. For dessert we ordered the triple chocolate mousse which was positively delicious. Unfortunately, the groupon only offers a limited number of the items on the menu so beware of that if you're looking for the groupon! The bill came out to be about $126 with tip and taxes which IMO is overpriced for mediocre food. Overall though, we had a lovely time and would recommend this place not for the food but the experience."}
{"text":"I've been trying to get friends to come here for a while because I thought it sounded cool, but my night tonight was about average, mostly due to food.  Pricing was reasonable, $30 for app, entree and dessert. Unfortunately they forgot about me and my friend's spring rolls and tried to give us our mains first, they quickly apologized but then when the spring rolls came they were frozen. The pasta was a bit oily for my taste.  The waitress was delightful. I did like the concept of signing and never felt it detracted, only added to the meal.  I would maybe come back again to give the food another chance and build on my vocab from last time, but my friends who are more foodies may not."}
{"text":"I'm iffy on this place. I sort of heard about it on the news one day and then forgot all about it until I walked in one day for lunch and the server signed to me hello how many are with you? In school I was exposed to a lot more ASL and this seemed a bit intimidating, but I felt why not let's do this. Sat down and the idea seemed simple. Your server comes out and introduces themselves and explains the menu. The hostess/interpreter was vocalizing to help facilitate. The server taught me some signs and we had a few jokes and then told me to wave him down when I was ready to order. This is where it got interesting.   The menu is simple only a few pages and has large pictures demonstrating how to order food in ASL. There is also a flippable sign that has conversational signs to sort of lighten the tension from the side of a non fluent speaker. The interesting part is that while reading over this and appreciating all of this the restaurant was a little empty and given that most of the staff is deaf, the room was rather quiet, except for the manager. They were very vocal in bad mouthing other staff members while walking back and forth from one section of the restaurant to the other. Not in any rage at all, simply just gossiping and using all sorts of profanity describing past interactions with existing workers.  I got the impression that they were \"totally fucking sick\" of certain people but they tolerated them for the theme of the restaurant. I felt very awkward at this point, because the menu is only so long and I could only pretend like I was studying it over for a few minutes. Flagging down my server at this point while the manager was clearly not acting very professionally at all was never the right time. Finally I had my chance a signaled him over. I ordered the venison shepherd's pie. It took a while to come out, but it was ok because I had dinner theater. The manager kept going and even had an interview for a dishwasher in front of me few seats away. That was not really a professional one either but then again I didn't know the entire situation. When the food finally came, it hit the spot. Really hearty filling venison pie. It was a little pricey but it was a themed restaurant. The server and hostess/interpreter were great. The manager was entertaining to say the least."}
{"text":"I've always walked past this restaurant and have always been curious about it. Finally my friend and I came on a Groupon deal that included a 3-course meal and a drink under $8. Overall I think it was a unique experience.   We had a warm welcome by the hostess and our server whom we learned how to sign with to order our food. There are \"cheat sheets\" that show diners basic dining sign language along with the menu that had the signs of all the food items. I got a Goat Cheese Bruschetta (5 pieces) and my friend got the Deep Fried Ravioli (5 pieces) with Pickles on the side. The Raviolis replaced a menu item that they did not serve anymore and the sign for it was not in the menu either so there was a little miscommunication and lack of preparation there. It didn't bother us too much. Nothing too spectacular but overall a good start to our meal.  For our main dish we both got Steak and Frites with a Creamy Caper sauce and it came with a side of sauteed vegetables. The steak was a little bit chewy even though I asked for medium rare. The strip of fat that was on the side of the steak did not help make the dish look more appealing. The fries were normal and the sauteed vegetables were better than plain steamed vegetables. Overall the flavour was there but my friend didn't like the sauce as she thought it took away from the flavour of the meat.  We were super stuffed by the end of our meal but we still had dessert! I ordered a Chocolate Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream drizzled with a caramel sauce and my friend had the New York-style Cheesecake. I love brownies so it was perfect for me. The cheesecake was good as well but we couldn't finish it all because we were too full and it was too heavy.  Our server and the other staff members were very helpful and very pleasant. He was very patient with our signing and very sweet. The experience was fun and delightful and the food was good as well. Would come back!"}
{"text":"What a unique experience! The atmosphere for this restaurant has been quite calm every time I've gone which is nice for me. Not many people are talking of course except for the few who are just having a conversation at their tables. Everybody was quite soft spoken I found.   Been here for both lunch and dinner and the menu is actually the same. There may be some festive menus (ie. Thanksgiving) but all in all, all the food I've had was delicious!   The butternut squash ravioli was absolutely delicious. I say it's a must and its vegetarian too. There's gluten free food as well. For those of you who eat meat, there's protein too don't worry. I've had the chicken wings and sandwich here. Not too bad.   Our waiter, Brandon was super friendly! He was always smiling and even if we made a mistake ordering, he knew what we were ordering and would correct us. It's important not to get frustrated through. There was a time we wanted to have a different menu when dessert came; we didn't know how to ask for the 'Thanksgiving menu' with the dessert we wanted (pumpkin pie) so we had to innovate and type it on our phones. Luckily, we had technology but it would've been more efficient if we knew ASL for 'the other menu'."}
{"text":"I drove up from Austin, Texas and ate at Signs Restaurant - those 2500 miles sure were worth it! For those unaware, Signs is a restaurant whose servers are deaf and use ASL (American Sign Language) to communicate with you. The menu has a handy guide to sign each food item.    Walking in, we were greeted with a friendly \"Welcome to the Signs Restaurant!\" both spoken and in ASL. Since it was our first time at the restaurant, our host, also an ASL translator, gave us a rundown of how to order and use the sign language cheat sheet. She also introduced our waitress to us, who taught us phrases such as \"water please\", \"thank you\", and \"I'm ready to order\". If you don't already know sign language, you have nothing to fear.  I'm incredibly impressed with the staff. So friendly. So nice. My family was pretty bad at signing our orders, but our waitress took it all my humor and patience - teaching us how to sign things correctly and often stopping by to check if everything was okay.   The food is pretty good, and the atmosphere is welcoming and fun. Most importantly, for those of us who are not deaf or do not know sign language, getting a glimpse into deaf culture and learning basic sign language is an experience I'll take with me for a long time. I would recommend everyone try to stop by here - whether you live in Toronto or Texas :)"}
{"text":"my first time at this restaurant, you may feel bit awkward but unique feeling when you are entering \"deaf people world\"because almost all waiters, staffs and chefs are deaf and hearing interpreters.  but i find this place is more like american casual club/bar restaurant which is great place for deaf people to hang out and meet new deaf people.    I am hard of hearing and doesn't know ASL language. i got invited by my hard of hearing friend last week, and I met her friends who can't speak orally. it was nice thing to see for them who can communicate to staffs in ASL is easier that makes them feel comfortable and confident.    I got free glass of water. , When i pointed plate from menu to waiter, I ordered a greek salad with chicken ( $15 plus tax). it's good salad , not big portion but nothing much special. i tasted my friend's plate, miso salmon $26, medium portion and taste is good but a bit bland. this plate took long time to prepare.  we waited for our food for like an hour or 40 mins. maybe is there short staffed in kitchen?  the prices of plates are bit pricey.   Few different waiters came to our table many times which is very confusing. some of them seem forgot to serve to someone's request. it should have been better is to have just one waiter (who can do both ASL and speech orally to those who dont speak ASL but that's OK ) which saves the consuming time of communication.   overall, it's ok satisfactory."}
{"text":"Well, this was fun. I do find the concept a little silly though - I mean eating in the dark at O'Noir is a worthy experience, but failing miserably at sign-language and pointing at the menu is not. Granted, they have a very visual menu, with all the signs for food. It's just that our whole table ordered from the specials, which were printed on a sheet of paper, without any of the signs. It's also not a \"silent\" dining experience. Peeps around be super noisy, yo!   Despite my rant above, dinner at Signs wasn't bad at all. The food was great, as was the attentive service. And the prices are extremely reasonable. I ordered a Filet Mignon for $20 something. That's a GOOD price for the cut. I do wish I'd ordered the \"duck poutine\" though. My friend did, and it looked godly. I had one bite and I was sold. I wanted more! I also tried the Calamari - not fried, grilled and I think they should mention that in the menu. Even then, it was pretty good.   I should mention too - the restaurant is tastefully decorated. It's spacious, the booths are cozy, and the walls are filled with a variety of great posters.   Verdict? Not sure if I'd go back for the experience, definitely would for the food."}
{"text":"I was brought here by a friend, who came here before due to a school project and she said many good things about Signs.   Environment: We came at around 12pm on a weekday, just when the restaurant opened, so we were the first to be served. The restaurant is nicely renovated, with a good number of tables, and a bar area. They have photos of sign language on the wall and a cheat sheet booklet on each table so that you can communicate with the server.  Food: The prices were fair, on average $15 per entree and the portions are quite large.  I got the lunch special, for $16 you get a choice of starter and an entree, so I had the Caesar salad and mushroom stuffed ravioli. The salad was ok, but the portion was really big so I shared it with my friend. The ravioli was really good, the sauce was creamy and wasn't too rich that I bores you. I ended up finishing everything and even drank the rest of the sauce.  My friend got the panko crusted chicken sandwich, which for $14 includes a starter as well, so she got the carrot soup. The carrot soup was interesting, it was very creamy due to the coconut milk, but it also has a kick to it due to the ginger. The chicken sandwich used 2 garlic bread slices as the bun, and oh boy that was delicious, for sure it's worth a try. Once again, the portion was big, definitely good for a large dinner as well.  Service: When we came into the door we were greeted warmly by the server. Even though communication was difficult at first, she was very nice and very patient with us, so we felt welcomed. I think everyone working at the restaurant is deaf, including the bartender, but some are able to speak some words. I wish the menu has some pictures though, because as someone who normally don't go to Western restaurants, I had to google what some of the dishes are.  Overall this is a great experience eating at Signs. I got to learn some sign languages while I was there, and I'm glad that Signs is able to provide employment opportunities for those with disabilities. The food was good and are priced very reasonably. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Signs,  When you walk in someone meets you who is singing and speaking at the same time, pretty cool!  They always had someone on hand to help in case there was a misunderstanding, but the process was so simple we did not need an interpreter. The food was very good and the prices reasonable. Many of the items had the ASL sign below it so you knew how to order it, I ordered a woodchuck cider (7$), and the sign was to make a woodchuck facial expression, the waitress and I had a chuckle at my woodchuck face.  Will def be back!"}
{"text":"I was there yesterday with two friends of mine. We made the trip, driving three hours from Chatman-Kent (Rondeau Park). It was an awesome experience for me. It was the first time I ever went to a restaurant and communicated entirely in my native language! It'll be an experience I will cherish. I ordered the Thai chicken burger, which was DELICIOUS. I am not a huge fan of mango which was one of the ingredients in the burger. DELICIOUS anyway. I also had a glass of woodchuck cider.   I love the decors in the restaurant. Modern and hip. With a touch of lime green, darker than that color. I hope the restaurant is successful for years to come.   I'll plan on returning if possible."}
{"text":"As a child of deaf parents, I have been out with my parents many times to eat. But this was the first ever I have been a restaurant where the server was deaf and I got to use my ASL to order food. I had a great experience. The decor was modern and fresh, they use the colors of black and green together really well. The food was great and the service outstanding. I will be back again!!"}
{"text":"This was a fun place for dinner! The atmosphere and  culture was really great. The waiting staff greet you in English and ask if you can speak American Sign Language (ASL), which I found to be very comforting and enlightening since I am not of the signing variety.   After sitting the waiting staff hands you a signing menu that explains what movements to make so you can communicate and order your meal. Very straight-forward and the staff were very accomodating, patient and understanding.   The food was fantastic! I recommend the Korean BBQ wings and the goat cheese bruscetta (both off their regular menu). The wings were baked, perfectly seasoned, not too saucy and not too dry. The goat cheese on the bruscetta was a nice touch.  The restaurant also has a fantastic dessert and drink menu. However, we did not order any, but the other tables were popping with good things.  I say 4/5 only because it took about 20 minutes to place our order and get a drink, but I'm sure this isn't always the case. Overall, this is a fun restaurant to experience. It's very insightful and humbling since I got a great meal and the ability to learn a bit about someone else's language and get a great meal."}
{"text":"On a weekend trip with some girlfriends, my friends tasked me with planning the itinerary for the trip, and I stumbled upon this goldmine known as Signs!  What an awesome experience. We were just blown away by the hospitality, decor and food presentation at this restaurant. Our waiter, Tristan, was beyond patient as we struggled with communicating via sign language. It was all in good fun and genuine appreciation of coming into the world of someone who would otherwise find it difficult to communicate with others. Thank you to the staff for making our trip and dining experience one that we will never forget."}
{"text":"I just tried Signs summerlicious dinner yesterday (July 19, 2016).  I made reservations for 6:30pm, but arrived ~30mins early and was seated immediately (a table for two).  The hostess and waiters were very friendly.    This place is very unique as you had to order your food using sign language.  The restaurant teaches you how to use sign languages from their wall, menu and sign language cards.  Although the waiter is deaf, they are able to mouth the word which makes it easier to understand.   My partner and I both ordered the Traditional Escargot for appetizer and it tasted delicious.  The garlic bread that came with it was hot and fresh and tasted good with the snail.   My partner and I decided to get different entrees so that we can share. For the entree, I ordered the Grilled Lamb Tenderloins.  It is served with lamb, mashed potatoes and ratatouille.  Everything in this entree tasted delicious.  The lamb was a bit medium-rare (which I prefer) and was so juicy! This was a great combination with mashed potatoes and ratatouille which also tasted so delicious!  I really enjoyed this entree!  My partner got the Two Lobster Tails which was served with gnocchi and baby spinach in aromatic tomato sauce.  The lobster tasted really good, however, the gnocchi was alright.  The gnocchi was kinda soft and didn't taste special.  I personally prefer the Grilled Lamb Tenderloins over the Two Lobster Tails.   For dessert, I ordered the Mango Sorbet.  It tasted alright.  My partner ordered the Chocolate Avalanche which also tasted alright.  It depends on what you're craving, if you have a sweet tooth, you'll probably enjoy the Chocolate Avalanche.   I had a good experience and would consider coming back again."}
{"text":"I came here with some classmates of mine for are monthly dinner. We ending up coming for winterlicious. I'm going to try my best to keep this review short & sweet.  Atmosphere - 3/5 it was ok. I didn't find anything wrong with it but I did not particularly love it either. They have pictures on the wall to teach you sign language. Hands down my favourite part.   Food - 5/5 I will 100% be coming back for the food. The carrot ginger soup I had was amazing. Have not been able to stop thinking about it. They have everything labeled on the menus for your common diary needs (gf/veg/vegan)   Service - 3/5 The service was great for the most part. The staff was on top of the groups allergies/ orders. The staff was super friendly unfortunately the food took forever to come, they would bring out half of the groups food while the other half waited another 10 minutes or so for food. They brought the same things twice. It was rather a hot mess.   Like I mentioned I will be coming back, just not with more then 2 people."}
{"text":"Food is yummy and visually stunning! We spent the Valentine's day here and are absolutely satisfied"}
{"text":"After going to O.Noir, I've been interested to try Signs Restaurant. I just so happened to try it during Summerlicious 2016!   First when you walk in, the host will have you seated and prep you with a few things before your server arrives. I believe most of the staff have hearing impairment. The host will teach you basic phrases in sign language like: yes, no, thank you.   When it was time for ordering I was nervous that I would miscommunicate with my server despite the cheat cards with photos. Our server was super friendly and made the experience very enjoyable! Ordering our food in sign language was definitely a memorable experience and the highlight of the meal!   As for the food, I got the escargot as an appetiser, lobster tail and gnocchi for main and a chocolate cake for dessert. I'd have to say that the overall meal was a 5/10... I think summerlicious in general is a good deal but I wouldn't pay $28 for this meal again. I really didn't like the escargot, it was drenched in butter but the texture was a no go for me. The lobster tail was the best part of the meal but still at best mediocre. The cake was not worth it either..  I would recommend trying Signs for the experience and trying their regular menu."}
{"text":"Great concept ! All staff here are deaf or hard of hearing and patrons get the opportunity to learn about the D/HH community while being introduced to American Sign Language. Conveniently located, it's steps from Wellesley Station. Signs has a large dining room along with a bar so it's a great venue for large groups. To eat, I had the fish and chips; you won't be blown away by the food, but it's also not terrible. Service was quite good with staff coming by often to see how we were doing.   Good for: lunch, dinner, drinks, groups"}
{"text":"I've been to restaurants where all the servers are blind, so I thought coming to Signs would be a cool and different experience as well! As a person with 0 knowledge of American Sign Language, I learned quite a few new words at Signs that will forever be ingrained in my brain, so I'm appreciative of that. However, Signs itself was an okay restaurant.  We came by for dinner, and the deaf servers were accompanied by translators to help us with the order. The restaurant was quite empty when we were there, and the servers were efficient and attentive to our needs. We ordered food in sign language (using the handy-dandy guides on our menus) and we got our food quite quickly!   It's actually quite an expensive affair for the size and quality of the food. Perhaps it's just what I ordered? Two main courses (no appetizers or desserts) + tax + tips became close to $60, which I was quite unhappy about. The Chicken Breast is bland, rather dry and definitely not worth $21, so don't bother getting it. The Seafood Gnocchi was chewy and hot with lots of seafood, but was ultimately quite pricey.   I guess you could say you're paying more for the experience! It's a restaurant I will not be returning to; once is enough for me."}
{"text":"Came here with a group for 14 people, staff were friendly but very absent. The majority of the time we spoke with 2 other staff members to get basic utensils, water and service in general. The main waitress who was the only one who we spoke sign language to, only took our orders. Although she was very kind, service was very absent.   We waited 1hr before we were even offered water, and when they brought it out, only half the table was served. The restaurant was not very busy yet the largest group of customers were not attended to.   The food itself was very mediocre and overpriced. Everyone at our table was brought cold food and the portions were very small for the price.   Although we came mostly for the experience of trying sign language, the only real experience we felt was ordering food and when they signed/sang Happy Birthday to a friend at our table.   The concept is unique, but I felt they could have integrated more aspects to enhance the experience. (Ex. video demonstration, more interaction with staff, more attentive to customers etc.).   The overall wait and mediocre food would not bring me back here for another visit."}
{"text":"I will never patronize this business as long as they kept Luc Pec who is the Junior Manager of Signs.  He abused Facebook trying to silence people who disagreed with him on different topics.  As long as Luc is still there, I wish to see this business fold eventually.  Luc Per, shame on you. Your oppression upon Deaf people are disgusting.  Shame on you."}
{"text":"It was an interesting experience. The waiter was very sweet and accommodating. The food and drinks were of good quality as well. Ordered bruschetta and mac and cheese and i loved both of them"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here. On top of the fun experience, all of our meals were delicious. When you arrive the host helps you learn some basic signs so you can communicate with your server, which was really helpful getting started. There's a guide to some other helpful signs on the table and every item on the menu (other than the daily specials which you point to) has a diagram to help you sign it. Our server was very kind and helped us with our signing when we weren't sure what to do. All in all it was a really enjoyable experience and I'd definitely go back.   The prices are a little bit high, but their lunch menu is much more reasonable and has many of the same options available.   I've been to ONOIR as well, which was a good experience, but I didn't really feel inclined to go back. It felt like more of an event than a dinner. Signs on the other hand feels more like a regular restaurant where you can just sit down and have a good meal. It's more akin to visiting a restaurant where everyone speaks a different language, which for anyone who lives in Toronto, should be a pretty normal feeling. So don't let the signing intimidate you, it's worth the visit."}
{"text":"When I booked this dinner, I didn't read any reviews or anything. It was I the trip advisor for restaurants to try in Toronto.   It was a surprise to us that wait staff are/most are deaf. It did not discourage us but actually we were into learning the sign language of each menu and gestures.    It was a challenge at first but I remembered when I was in high school we studied sign language using the alphabet letters. We were able to use that at some part of the dinner.    I felt so thankful and appreciate life more after dining to this place. Kudos to the owner of this place since he embraced the world of sign language."}
{"text":"First of all, I am biased already because this place hires people with disabilities, so thank you for that. The service is amazing, everyone is so friendly and willing to help when you're struggling. Food was delicious, but of course being in a nicer place, the portions were a little on the small side, but still would be alright. The place was clean, very well kept, and had the cutest book on the table to teach you sign language to help you communicate with the servers. If you had any troubles, there's always one or two servers who could speak with you. The only issue was when I went, I was in a bit of a rush, I had somewhere to go in 2 hours and didn't think food would take that long. Unfortunately, my friends and I ended up taking the full two hours because it took a while for the food to come, and a while to actually get the bill. It was downtime so the server was not always around but when she was, she was very kind and courteous.  Overall, other than the long wait times, absolutely wonderful restaurant. Would definitely recommend and come back again."}
{"text":"*There is usually a host or hostess here who here who acts as the translator between the customers and servers.   *Food wasn't that great overall, however i still recommend everyone to try it out for the novelty.   -Taro Chips & Guacamole - $10:  This was an appetizer of taro chips with guacamole, tomato sauce and sour cream. I thought it was an okay dish. Tomato sauce had no flavor, and the guacamole was really creamy but I wish there was more lime or something tangy to cut the fatty flavor of the avocado. The chips were lightly salted and since the chips were not too thin, they were the perfect vessels to hold the dips.  -Butternut Squash Ravioli - $19:  I thought the ravioli was decent with a good ratio of filling to dough. However the combination of enoki and shiitake (?) mushrooms didn't really work for me. I felt the whole dish was too earthy and there was nothing else to balance the creamy butternut squash filling. It also had too much olive oil tossed with it so the ravioli were quite greasy.  -Miso Salmon - $26:  The salmon was dry and bland, and I couldn't taste any of the miso marinate. The risotto was a bit mushy and I'm not sure what happened, but the rice had an overpowering artificial lemon fragrance. It was almost like eating a chopped up bar of lemon soap....I didn't care too much for the sauce as it added no flavor to the salmon. With their asking price of $26, I can't recommend this dish at all.  -Butter Chicken Poutine - $12:  For $12 the portion was pretty good and you are getting chunks of juicy and tender chicken. The fries were ok and nothing special, however the butter chicken sauce was delicious! With that said, the cheese curds didn't fully melt so with every bites, you are not getting the squeaky and stringy cheese curds that you would often find in a poutine."}
{"text":"This is another case where 3.5 stars would be ideal.  The concept is cool..it's a restaurant that focuses on employment and career development for the deaf.    I would call it more of a tourist destination than a foodie one.   It's roomy and clean and the staff are friendly and courteous.   A pint of cracked canoe (which you sign by making a zigzag with your finger followed by the motion of paddling a canoe) is a steep $9. The food is average. The chicken piri-piri was a pricey $28. I also tried the soup of the for a reasonable $5 and a nutella tiramisu for $9.  It's worth a try for a unique and humbling experience but won't rock your tastebuds."}
{"text":"When I first approached this restaurant, I looked up at the sign and was confused because I thought I was about to enter a massage parlor...I personally think that their outdoor restaurant plaque could use some work.  So we entered and were asked if we had a reservation, and we didn't but that was fine as it was pretty empty. This was a really quiet restaurant, when we were there at least (on a saturday afternoon). I kind of liked that. It was interesting. I looked around and observed that this restaurant was really more of a nice place for people who are deaf or mute to hang and have a nice bite.  The manager seated us and introduced the story behind this restaurant and how we can order our food. Pretty much after that intro, we were on our own. Even though we had a cheat sheet on how to sign with our server, it was still quite an intimidating experience because we had no prior knowledge of american sign language, and weren't sure if we were reading the sign diagrams correctly/signing correctly.   We must have signed correctly as we got the order we wanted. We ordered from the lunch menu: Wild Rice & Corn Fritters, Penne Arrabiata, and Venison Shepherd's Pie. The food was tasty, but a bit on the pricey side for the portions served. My favourite would be the Wild rice & Corn Fritters. It comes with a honey mix dipping sauce that tastes super good with the fritters. Personally, I didn't like the Penne Arrabiata... it had an odd bitter after taste, probably from the greens.  Service was great. Servers were friendly and patient with us. I'm sure they saw us struggling with communication. It was a great experience in the end and I think we will come again to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"It's a cool concept and fun to try out at least once.  The salmon was good.  The only reason why  they received less stars because the wait of the food was pretty long"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner this past weekend and had a really fantastic experience. I was a bit nervous about signing, but the staff were incredibly helpful and patient. Our waitress was adorable and really friendly. We didn't have a problem understanding her at all.  Like someone else mentioned before, it is very quiet in the restaurant as the staff aren't speaking. But it was nice to be able to actually hear the person across the table from me. Maybe it would help the ambiance to have a little music or something though.  Fresh buns and butter were served to us before our meal and they were hot and delicious. I ordered the cream of spinach soup to start and then the butternut squash ravioli for my main course. Both were presented well and tasted great. Not a single complaint about the food. If people have apprehensions about the food not tasting as great because the focus is on the staff, they'd be wrong.   It costs about the same as a higher end restaurant, but it's well worth it for the experience."}
{"text":"If ONOIR gives you a slight insight of how people with vision loss experience the world, SIGNS gives you the same oppurtunity with hearing loss.   The places is modern with booths n tables. You are introduced to your waiter/ress n are thought the basic sign language to communicate (since your servers have hearing loss).  Your menus also show you how to order a particular dish.  I ordered the duck confit poutine (which was good), a friend ordered a salad n her bf ordered a jambalaya risotto.   A fun experience for sure n will go back again!"}
{"text":"Last minute plans change let us to come to this restaurant. I read what the restaurant was about and wanted to support it. We came in to the restaurant. They have a ramp to make it accessible which helps when you have a stroller. They have plenty of space and you will not feel claustrophobic in here. The menu defines eclectic as they have great options from various cuisines. We ordered spring rolls, the ravioli (spicy!), long Island iced tea, the chocolate avalanche and the cannoli. With the exception of the cannoli all of the items were created well. Our waitress was pleasant and great to work with. They helped us along with the ASL and the menu features ASL to assist in ordering. I will be back."}
{"text":"I found Signs on TripAdvisor while looking for interesting eats in Toronto. I really enjoyed the experience of signing my requests. It was a really eye opening exposure to the deaf community. My server was very nice and very patient with me even when I struggled a bit. The food was very good, better than I expected. I had the butternut squash ravioli and it was delicious!! The only thing that hindered my meal was being put in the back of the dining room when I was the only patron in at the time. I really would have preferred sitting out in the main room near the windows. The other thing that I found quite annoying as I was trying to enjoy my meal was the hostess and another person having an extremely loud meeting or conversation. It   just kind of negated my experience.  Definitely would recommend Signs to anyone visiting the Toronto area!!"}
{"text":"What started off as a \"should we do it\" kitsch experience,  ended with a surprisingly great meal. Signs is an ASL based sign language only restaurant. Its staff, as expected are deaf, but it does not stop them from being attentive, helpful, and giving an experience worth remembering.   As idea from , signing our orders, the table has helpful hints to learn to sign, all of us ended up making signs or critiquing each others new word,be forwarded too long our good arrived. Best part , It Was Delicious! My gosh, I was so happy. Tried portions of everyone else's too. Just fabulous. Will be back."}
{"text":"A very nice experience, good service, very clean place and the food was delicious! You should definately try it with family or on a date. You will leave with a trick or too up your sleeve. Bravo!"}
{"text":"My family & I LOVED this restaurant!! We loved the food and the whole experience. The kids meals were great for my 11 & 9 year olds and came with the perfect amount of food. My husband ordered the Pad Thai and I ordered a burger and we both loved our meals as well. On top of the food, the experience was one we won't forget! Everyone is very patient and VERY helpful with teaching the appropriate and necessary signs. I have studied sign language in the past so I did have some basic knowledge but I think even without it'd be okay. The hostess is not deaf and able to help interpret if needed. We were just visiting Toronto but this would definitely be a frequent visit if we lived near. I will say the service was on the slow side and it was quite pricey but for us, it was worth it."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers a unique experience where customers order from the menu in American Sign Language, as all the servers are deaf. For those who are like me who know nothing about the language-don't fright! There's a cheat sheet for all of us beginners. We heard about this place a while ago and finally had a chance to try it out. We found a voucher on groupon that included a 3 course meal and drinks for two people for $86 (I believe the voucher is still available on groupon for those interested).   To be honest, the total price wasn't worth it. The quality of the food just wasn't there and the portion was smaller than expected. Our bill was a little over $100 including tax and tip. My girlfriend and I got escargot for starters (I've had better), seafood gnocchi and grilled veal for main, mango sorbet and chocolate cake for dessert (the desserts were AMAZING). The veal was tender and delicious, but the seafood gnocchi was too soft and the sauce was bland. For drinks we ordered from the \"house cocktails\" section (we got Havana Beach and Strawberry Zing) and they were made really good too.   The staff is suuuuppperrrr friendly there! We were very impressed with their hospitality. However service was kind of lacking tonight. The food came out quite slow, but the hostess was very respectful in informing us and apologizing on behalf of the kitchen. It also seemed like we were served by 3 different servers as they were always there to refill water or clear our tables when needed. When we came it was around 8:30pm on a Saturday and it was quiet. The atmosphere (along with the staff) made us feel very welcomed and warm.   Overall we felt like we paid for the experience of interacting in ASL rather than for the food. We would come back once we learn more ASL so we can have better conversations with our servers!"}
{"text":"there are a couple things i want to say about this place.  walking into this place, i had a somewhat biased opinion about the restaurant. i felt like it was gimmicky, the whole sign language thing. but i kind of grew an appreciation for it by the end of my meal.  now, i did still end up leaving thinking it was a bit gimmicky, because doing sign language to order my food didn't make my food taste any better. BUT i thought this was a great way to provide work for those who are hard of hearing while at the same time educating us onhow difficult it can be to communicate with with kind of a lifestyle.  so for the food, i ordered a cheeseburger. so the only things i could remember in regards to sign language was how to say cheeseburger, thank you, and no. lol. cheeseburger was not bad. pretty standard but the people with my really liked the pork belly sandwich thing. so give that a try i guess."}
{"text":"I went there on a date with my boyfriend and it was our first time to have an alternative dining experience.  We shared the chili-lime shrimps which were excellent, def a retake and both had burgers. It was fun to practice the communication and our burgers were of decent quality!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great time with some delicious food. We learn so much in just a short evening. I had the Caesar salad, lamb with a side of ratatouille and mash potatoes. For the dessert I had cannoli. It was my first time have all expect for the Salad. I enjoy the experience and the meal. Would definitely do again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the experience of learning sign language and the food was good and the drinks were fantastic. Great service!!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! The food is Amazing! I had the lamb dish and it was melt in your mouth perfect! It's a unique dining experience as well. The servers are so helpful in teaching you how to sign. Great experience all around!"}
{"text":"Came here with a groupon, had a 3-course meal for two with drinks and it was fantastic. The experience with the waiters was a lot of fun and learning ASL made it enjoyable. I ordered the jicama watermelon salad, butternut squash ravioli, and lemon burst dessert. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"What a great experience! I had heard about this place all the way from Australian almost 2 years ago and said I'd have to try it if I was ever in Toronto. Fast forward and we had a single day and night in Toronto yesterdat and this was where we had dinner.  Such a cool concept. The owners, a married couple who are not deaf but thought that deaf people needed a restaurant that they could have a better dining experience, were both on the floor and we spoke to the wife who said she was learning ASL at night school, she was really lovely and a great host.  After you are seated you are told about the concept and shown the ASL tricks and tips guide then they bring your waiter over and she introduced herself via a translator and gave us some signs such as yes, no, please, thank you, enjoy. It's such fun trying to learn the words and then ordering in ASL. For someone who has never done any sign language before it was a great experience and the pictures are great at teaching you.   We thought it was funny that in this restaurant non ASL speakers were the \"difficult\" tables and when we were there we saw a number of ASL people arrive and I'm sure the waitresses were like \"phew, an easy table!\" lol which is so great, I hadn't really ever thought how hard it must be for the deaf to eat out at standard restaurants!   Anyway, now for the meal. We had the special 3 course meal for $35 each (plus tax and tip) where you pick from a few options that are on the regular menu. This is a great deal given the usual main courses are between $20-29. The food is pretty good, pretty standard fare. I really enjoyed the peppercorn sauce on the NY strip steak (which was also cooked well) and my bf had the Mahi Mahi which had really great blackening.  The service is good, our server was great and super friendly! it is not particularly fast given the ASL newbies like us take forever to order, so definitely don't come here for a quick meal (not like you'd want to, we enjoyed trying to learn words over dinner).  Loved the place and a very memorable dinner!"}
{"text":"Came for summerlicious. 5 stars for the experience and service was awesome. Super fun! 3 stars for the food. I had the escargot which was ok. The springs rolls were not worth it. The lobster was good but my gnocchi was so undercooked i couldn't eat it, but didn't know how to say it so didn't bother. Mango sorbet was really good though. Overall I would recommend this place for the experience."}
{"text":"Got the jerk chicken gnocchi and loved it.   The idea of having deaf servers is neat but not a huge focus of the restaurant. There is a booklet on the table with common phrases in ASL and you can order from the menu in ASL but beyond that, it is just a regular restaurant experience with regular amount of interaction with the server.  I would return not necessarily for the experience, but because I enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Watermelon salad was good, mac&cheese bites tasted like mac&cheese bites. The steak peppercorn was salty but really tasty, although the fries seemed stale and tasteless. My partner enjoyed the salmon, and adding the ginger was a nice touch. Desserts were pretty good...   Just the food alone would warrant a 4/5 because everything was satisfying, but not unique enough to be a wow-factor.   Service brought a star down. Our server was really kind and was patient with us when we tried our best to sign our choices, but he was so slow with our orders and got the bill wrong :( He said sorry about 5 times throughout the night, which I understand he really did feel bad. But I'd rather just not be neglected. Having served myself, I'd say this is on the restaurant for either not having enough workers on the floor, or for giving a rookie too much to handle. Either way, stretching thin doesn't always mean money saved... sacrificing quality of service isn't the way to go.   I enjoyed my time nonetheless having learned some sign language, but I will not be going back."}
