{"text":"If you looking for a place which offer good food with low prices..this is the place. I like going there for b/f. They don't use egg beaters like some of the other places which i like. They almost serve everything you would normally have for b/f. The owner sometimes will have fresh baked cake which tastes great with coffee. They are open late and serve all day b/f and have good potion size. Keep in mind is that they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Good food. Large portion. Rated 4 for accepting only cash!"}
{"text":"I wasn't really into this place. The menu isn't all that great, the service was unfriendly and the bacon cheeseburger I had was \"just okay\". At least my drink was cold... I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"The Friendly House is a 24/7 diner that offered good service in a quiet environment. I've passed by this place tons of times over the years but haven't had a chance to stop by until now. It's a nice place to drop in for an early breakfast, late dinner or any time of the day, any time of the week. Also, unfortunately, this place only accepts cash."}
{"text":"I've only been here after midnight.  Portion sizes for the hot dinners are big Service is quick (generally we're the only ones here) Pretty quiet here...   To be honest I don't ever seeing myself ever coming here during the day. I'm pretty sure their menu stays the same throughout the day. I'd probably eat elsewhere if I could. If you come here late at night looking to satisfy those hunger pangs, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is good and prices are reasonable but the place is a dump. It's cash only and the fact that they serve cheap booze brings a crowd of regulars that is interesting to say the least. Order ahead and take the food and run unless you'd like to watch senior citizens getting drunk and embarrassing themselves.... it's really not as fun as I have made it sound but they are open 24 hours 365 days so that counts for something"}
{"text":"Large portions, good food, and friendly service! Not to mention they're open all the time.  If it's late and you're hungry it's definitely a good place to go.  They've changed owners (and names) a couple times but it's always tasted relatively the same.  Their burgers and greek food are the best, and i've come here for takeout more than once.  Lots of seating and easy parking. Bring cash though."}
{"text":"3.5 stars Friendly House has been around for years on the corner of Drewry and Yonge under different names (formerly Shake N Burger). The diner is open 24/7 and despite the presence of some oddball customers if you visit in the middle of the night, you can always be sure you are greeted by people who appreciate your business, and that you'll be having probably the best late night grub anywhere north of Bloor St. At just under $5, the shawarma served in Greek style pita bread is full of flavour and fresh toppings. The souvlaki, steak, and gyros are all viable options in the order mentioned! That being said, I usually order just the sandwiches as I'm not a big fan of Friendly fries.  Friendly House has a pretty extensive all day breakfast menu as well if you are in the mood.   Overall quick service, and cheap tasty diner food make the Friendly House one of the best late night options uptown."}
