{"text":"The meat and seafood is really top notch. Definitely a bit expensive but there's usually a few very reasonable options in there too. The best part is the sandwiches though, they are simply incredible and are actually pretty cheap. The space is nice but I tend to take everything to go. Give this place a shot, they aren't getting the attention they deserve."}
{"text":"Outstanding. I watched their construction for a year and am not at all disappointed in the wait. Friendly, energetic staff and great looking food to boot. I tried the shrimp ceviche and the sweet potato with maple vinaigrette salad for lunch and both were outstanding. I will be back for the deli and can't wait to take home some meat and fish too."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to the meat and fish company. Both Tommy and Chris were kind and professional. In addition they were also very helpful in explaining what they had and did not have in stock  and what they could get for me. I know there's a lot of bad press on yelp in regard to the meat and fish company but my experience today was very professional and I will be back."}
{"text":"Not sure why no one else has reviewed them yet, but yay for me! Perhaps I'm the first because although their permanent signage on the street and on the building is up, they don't have any signs on their tinted doors so even when they're open, it is questionable. They should put hours on the door perhaps? You may remember Meat & Fish Company from the 7th Street Public Market and many were disappointed that they closed. Finally they opened at the new location at the corner of Morehead and McDowell next to Dilworth Neighborhood Grill. 

The inside of the market features a deli counter, meat counter and fish counter. Usually when you walk into a seafood market (even high end ones like Clean Catch) it smells like fish. This place doesn't. The meat is all sourced through two ranches that they offer extensive material and information on (and after all, we know knowledge is power) and most of it is grass fed. 

The Fish counter isn't large but it is GOOD. They offer typical fish like flounder and salmon but special catches like a limited run of Columbia River Salmon from OR. Also they have unusual wild catches you usually only see in restaurants, like Wreckfish. I purchased Corvina and U10 scallops. I had been excited a month before when I bought Corvina at Publix and discovered you really get what you pay for and it was awful. This corvina was fresh, fleshy, flaky and buttery tasting. YUM! The quality seemed to be better than Catch On, Fresh Market, Reid's and Earth Fare (and obvi definitely better than HT/Publix). You have to take out a second mortgage for Clean Catch so I offer this as a good alternative. Just like any good market, they assured me if I was looking for something in particular they would order it in and just need a couple days, so consider that for your next party. 

The deli counter has a limited menu - a handful of sandwiches and a couple salads and it looks like the menu evolved since I visited and they've added a veggie wrap and nicoise sandwich. My husband had a roasted ribeye sandwich which he said was the best sandwich he had in Charlotte and had it 3 times since. The steak was thick and juicy, the roll was obviously fresh made (I think you can also buy baguette and rolls there). It was a perfect hearty sandwich when you're really hungry. They also seemed to have a broccoli salad and a shrimp ceviche you could get a scoop of. There is plenty of cute seating inside as well as some seating outside if you want some Vitamin D. 

Definitely glad they reopened- welcome to Midtown!"}
{"text":"Very limited selection.. went for salmon and only had farm raised...???... Flies were all over what little was in the case, yuck!!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! I'll definitely be back! The service is impeccable and the meat and seafood selection is top notch. A little pricey, but well worth it (based on the samples the chef shared with me). Perfect lunch spot or dinner decider! There's also limited bar seating inside if you want to stay for lunch."}
{"text":"It's good food but boy do you pay for it - $34 for 2 sandwiches w/chips.  That's a little more than I was anticipating.  

I had the lobster roll & my companion had the steak.  it was warm & delicious.  It's best of eaten there.  The steak roll had a bit of that soggy roll happening when taken ~5 mins away & was more like a french dip that had been dipped so a bit messy depending on where you taking it to eat like the park.  

We'll come back to survey the case offerings."}
{"text":"The salmon was good and not fishy tasting, which I really hate. The employees are nice but a little disorganized - they overcharged me but I didn't realize until I was already home. Since the fish was good I'll probably go back but may wait a while for them to iron out the kinks."}
{"text":"First day soft open is going well...

Fresh deli with gourmet sandwiches! Where have you been all our lives?

Small selection of top notch meat. Small selection of top shelf seafood. And fresh lobster!

Nice cold case of sodas including Dr Bowns Red Cherry.

Oh, and you can order online from their website and walk right in to pick it up.

Today I had the Muffulettas which had a tasty olive tapenade on it. What a monument to muffuletta! Six inches tall at it peak.

I will come back at least once a week to this handy spot on E Morehead."}
{"text":"So happy this place is next to my work. Would come in every day if they had a tv and offered wifi"}
{"text":"Color me unimpressed. I think we might have caught them on a bad day, but first impressions are everything and I'm sorry to say we were grossly disappointed. 

Selection was really limited! They had a couple cuts of beef and 3 or 4 fish selections. Plus kobe beef patties that looked like they had been sitting out for days. I've seen pictures of their case with all sorts of wild game and was excited about/expecting a lot to choose from. There was not a piece of venison, lamb, housemade sausage, kabob, etc. to be had when we stopped in @ 6pm on a Friday. 

We initially went in for the king salmon but spooked when we saw the almost $50 per pound price tag. Not wanting to walk out empty handed, we got two filets of sand bass (about 0.7 lb. worth) for $20. We cooked it not less than 20-minutes later and after a couple bites, threw it all away. The texture of the fish was mushy and slimey. And, despite my boyfriend's heavy hand with seasoning, still managed to taste overwhelmingly fishy. 

The shop itself is beautiful. I love their sense of humor in the design -- from the fish-shaped parking lines to the t-rex logo for provisions. I can tell a lot of love and attention to detail went into this place. BUT, if the product is two or three times the cost of competitors and doesn't blow me away every time (much less, isn't even edible... still can't believe we trashed $20 worth of fish) I just can't justify coming back."}
{"text":"I don't often take the time to do reviews but this place is exceptional. The cuts of meat of above par, better than most butcher shops.  
And the sandwiches are delicious.  My husband had the steak sandwich and I had the boar meatloaf sandwich which was the special today.  We also had a cup of roasted tomatoe and fennel soup.  I look forward to coming back as everything was well worth it!
Chocolate chip cookies also amazing!  Chewy and loaded with good chocolate."}
{"text":"My first review was 5 star. after two really bad experiences I would have to rate it a 1.. ( I would Give no star if allowed) 
The first two times were great. Donny who I guess is the store manger or GM if I had to guess made sure every thing ran smooth and the customer was happy. Last two times he was not there and it was awful from start to finish. This last time being the worst. 
I got the counter salad which last time I found a wrapper in my salad as well as no almonds. I tried to put that behind me and order the salad again. This time I got no turkey, no almonds and no pasta!!!!! It was to go, so I got home and went to return the salad, or get a new one. 
The gentlemen at the counter said they are out of pasta. Well that would have been nice to know.. He sprinkled the almonds on the salad and said here you go. I was appalled.. I asked for a fresh salad.. That will be my last visit. In this guys defense he was the only one in the store with several customers in the store. That's just poor management."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The latest being Valentine's Day, because nothing says Love like fresh grouper. While there wasn't any out, I asked if they had any in the back and they did. What I didn't expect was for the butcher to bring out an entire fresh (never frozen) fish. It was gigantic. I told him how much I wanted and he cut the exact amount before my very eyes. I was highly impressed. You get what you pay for and the fish cost me a pretty penny at $20/lb. I grossly overestimated how much fish I needed and ended up paying about $40. So be it. Once prepared, the grouper tasted very fresh and I ate it for 3 days. I was given a 10% discount out of kindness.

Taco Tuesday was in full effect here and I picked up some steak tacos. They looked unappetizing, but were fresh with lime, cilantro, and parmesan cheese (I think), tasting much better than what met the eye.

The displayed options vary from week to week, but there's generally several meat and seafood options to choose. If what you want isn't there, just ask. They will custom order request. Overall, a nice place for fresh food, but be prepared to walk out with lighter pockets."}
{"text":"Day Boat Run Seafood Chowder... a must try! The gentleman had me when he described it... a little mix of whatever seafood is available that day. Then he let me try it.  OMG! The creamiest, heartiest seafood chowder I can recall. I had to have a cup to go. There were so many chunks of amazing seafood, a chunk or more in every bite! Mussels, salmon and some other amazing fish items (doesn't even matter about the specifics)!

We purchased prime rib eyes to go and cannot wait to let them cook to perfection tomorrow on the grill. 

I will be going back for lunch...guess what I definitely will hav"}
{"text":"Myself and a coworker stopped in for lunch yesterday and the place looks great! Before I go any further,  I definitely recommend the she crab soup! The staff was very inviting and they will cook anything that you purchase! If you call them ahead of time, they will cook it for you so you can quickly swing by on the way home and have a precooked meal ready as soon as you arrive home! When you pull into the parking lot, take a look at the parking \"lines\"! I don't want to give too much away but it was a very creative way of  changing up the basic parking lines you typically see!"}
{"text":"I went in to buy meat to grill.  All looked really dry and decided to get seasoned chicken and I was assured the meat would be moist..... It was dry and terrible !  I was less than impressed with what I saw and the result proved such!"}
