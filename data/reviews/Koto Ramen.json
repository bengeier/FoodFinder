{"text":"After seeing the reviews on yelp, I wonder how bad can the Ramen be. Well I guess, the reviews don't lie. I order a spicy shoyu Ramen. After sipping the broth for the very first time, I couldn't argue with the other reviewers. To the management, please do something with your broth at least. I've eaten quite a lot of Ramen places both in the West and East Coast. There is no broth like yours. Please do something to your broth."}
{"text":"$7.66 (after tax) gets you 5 wimpy pieces of shrimp that taste just as weak as they look. It comes with wet rice and a small portion of grilled vegetables.  Taste 2/5 Portion 1/5 Value 1/5 Overall quality 1/5  Felt like I ordered plain rice with shrimp served on the side as a poor after thought."}
{"text":"I've never really hit up the Ramen scene yet, even though it seems to be taking over everywhere.  This place was brand new to town, Sakanaya has been around a while, but decided to give this place a try at a friend's request.  First of all, having no exposure to the ramen scene, I expected to walk in and find prices for food to be 4 or 5 dollars for a bowl of ramen.  After all, you can get a cup ramen for 25 cents, so a reasonable upcharge on upscaling a cheap food item, I was thinking 4 or 5 dollars.  So as you can imagine, walking in and seeing prices in excess of $12 or $13 dollars sort of took me by surprise.  I almost decided to leave right there seeing as dinner for two was going to set me back 30 dollars with tip, and 30 dollars for ramen?  Chipotle or Five Guys would be a better investment, value to deliciousness ratio.  Still, this being my first exposure to ramen, I guess it was educating to find out that everyone is upcharging this much.  I don't know what the possible overhead could be on some of these items.  A simple bowl of ramen in excess of 10 dollars... there had better be a side of cucumber salad, a 6 piece California maki, and some green tea included or something, alas no... it was just the ramen.  So on the merits of value, this places gets a 3/10.  I don't feel as ripped off as when I go to a tapas place, or go to GT Fish and Oyster in Chicago (where I feel as though they take my money, my clothes, my dignity, and my self respect, and in return, they give me two oysters that taste like freezer burn thawed dressed up snot balls).  But if this is to be a regular joint for me to visit, value's gotta be upwards of a 7 or 8 out of 10 value.  And in today's economy, I'd argue it's that simple.  Keep it affordable, and I'll continue to come around.    My wife got the kalbi ramen, good choice.  I decided to make myself feel less ripped off and went for something simple, chicken teriyaki, to see how this place would spin a beloved classic.    My wife's ramen was actually pretty dang good.  Some insider information has informed me that the cooks have been doing it for 3+ decades, and know what they are doing.  Ramen noodles are of the highest quality, and the broth is not overly seasoned needlessly.    What surprised me the most was the quality of the kalbi she had.  It wasn't garbage meat that you pick up in the \"unknown meat\" section of the super market, but it was a high quality melt in your mouth giant piece of kalbi.  Really good.  The additional fixings in her ramen were less than remarkable.  Where I praise the quality of the kalbi, and the ramen noodles themselves, the broth though it tasted good, was extremely greasy.  A flash refrigeration cycle to get the fat solidified on top, then skimmed, and reboiled wouldn't hurt in their food prep procedures.  After only a few spoonfuls of the broth, I felt like my face was oozing garlic and someone had put sesame oil on their hands, and rubbed it all over my face.  So, probably some of the prep process can be improved over all there.  A fat skimming refrigeration of the broth would go a long way.  The chicken teriyaki I got was unremarkable.  Surprised since it cost I think $8 or $9.  I was expecting a sizable portion and a bunch of fixings to balance out the chicken, but no, just salad, rice, and the chicken.  Even after adding in overhead and paying people, justifying $8 or $9 for that is pretty unheard of.  From a taste perspective, it was just standard.  I'd go as far as to say it lacked inspiration or imagination, and more enjoyment could have been realized from baking plain chicken at home, and pouring store bought teriyaki sauce on it. Perhaps a bit harsh there.  On the merits of taste in general, the place gets a 6/10.  The savior was the ramen (as expected).  From a service perspective, the people were great, polite.  I did feel as though once I had paid, I was dead to the hostess, and any further dealings with me would be a waste of her time.  For being someone who has no idea about the ramen scene, I was expecting her to tell me what to do, or what to expect, where I can get my food, or who will be delivering it to my table, etc. So I picked up some napkins, and some plastic utensils, not having any idea what to expect.  All of a sudden the cook yelled out a number.  Having no idea what was going on, I sought the receipt that I had crumpled up into my pocket, only to realize that I'm supposed to get my own food.  That's totally fine of course, except for the fact that no one told me how anything worked.  So for 30 seconds, the cook continued to yell out a number and got increasingly upset. My bad, I didn't know!  Merits of service.  3/10.  Final thoughts.  Cost doesn't justify volume of food, and just \"ok\" taste.  Probably a once every 4 years restaurant for me.  Sakanaya will probably be no better.  We'll see."}
{"text":"Save the expense and buy some Shin ramen at Amko, go home and make it there. It will be a million times better than this.   Flavors were barely there or kind of off. Everything was overpriced. It is laid out very awkwardly. Extremely underwhelmed. Won't be going back. I'd be surprised if it lasted the entire year."}
{"text":"I ordered the shoyo ramen with pork.  Pros:  Convenient location. It is where Drew's pizza used to be.  Clean, good service.  You can watch the kitchen make your food while you sit.  Cons:  Its expensive. After tax my bowl of noodles was over 10 dollars.  Smaller portions. I received one slice of pork, half an egg, and skimpy noodles. It is telling that I was hungry a few hours after eating there.  The broth was very unimpressive. I strongly suspect the broth is not made by the restaurant, and instead they buy pre packaged broth. I've had frozen ramen with pre packaged broth from AMKO that was equal to Koto's offering.   Overall, I think the restaurant made a good attempt, but their food is a overpriced and not a good value. Additionally, I have had much better ramen from shops on the west coast which charged the same price."}
{"text":"First of all, a store that is advertised as a Ramen store should at least be using real Ramen noodles. Instead, they committed the biggest food crime by substituting the more expensive Ramen noodles with Chinese lo mein noodles. To make it worse, the broth is basically hot water with tons of MSG. The pork tastes like dry cardboard and it seems that the chef do not even know how to properly cut a meat. The egg is over boiled and even the mushroom used are the ones used for the actual lo mein dish. The worst crime is to actually having the audacity to charge $9 for a \"lo mein soup\".  I would recommend not supporting a dishonest business that tries to trick the customers. Basically, if you are looking for some decent Ramen, AVOID this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"I'll be the first to admit that I know very little about authentic ramen. None, actually. However, I do have the good fortune of possessing taste buds, a feature that I would have gladly seen diminished during my trip to Koto Ramen.  Working on campus right across the street, I'm always interested when a new lunch option opens up. After my initial disappointment about the latest offering being yet another noodle & rice type of place, I decided to check it out.  First, owing to my acknowledged ignorance about the menu and genre, I asked the order taker/cashier what he might suggest. \"Order whatever you like,\" was the ever-so-helpful reply. I doubled back with, \"What do most people order?\" thinking you can't really dodge that one. Miso, he said. So I ordered the pork miso ramen to go.  I nestled up at the counter, overlooking the glass-front prep/kitchen area. Reminded me of Shakey's pizza where you could watch the dough fly and toppings scatter. And then I noticed something that really caught my eye. A woman worker pulled out these little gray strips of meat, laid them out on a baking sheet, then pulled out a blowtorch and started giving them the flame. I've since learned that this is a Japanese technique that calls for searing the fat with high heat. Not sure her technique was, um...valid.  The result was absolutely disgusting. The ramen itself might have at one time been palatable (no better than the $.19 cent County Market variety, though) but instead the entire \"dish\" was infused with the distinct flavor of propane. I was sick to my stomach for the rest of the day.  Oh, and it was $11 for this disappointment. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"This place really sucks. I have to wait 20 minutes before my food is ready even when there is not any other order before me! Will never come back again. Also the ramen I had sucks. Even instant noodle is way better."}
{"text":"The girl working at the counter was very nice and explained the different types of ramen soup bases. The interior of the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. I tried one bite of my bf's tonkatsu ramen, which was disappointing. The texture of the noodles resembled that of spaghetti, the egg was overcooked, and the pork was tough. Save your money and buy a packet of Shin ramen--that's probably more satisfying."}
{"text":"I went to Koto Ramen for the first time recently, I got the pork ramen with pork base. Basically, it's just okay.   The good - interior design is nice, looks kinda upscale-ish. Sleek, hip, cool. The staff is friendly. Nice, helpful, friendly. The food is alright. Noodles, vegetables, and broth are all tasty.   The bad - the pork was really poor quality. Thin, tough, tasteless. The price was too high for the quality of the food. Overpriced, steep, $8 for a bowl of mediocre ramen?!  It's not that great. If you're on campus and in the mood for ramen, go for it, on a date with someone who wants ramen? Okay. Otherwise, avoid it.  But that's just my preference."}
{"text":"I came here with an optimistic friend, after reading the one star yelp reviews and hearing how bad it was from my roommate. I was pleasantly surprised to have an moderately enjoyable, though overpriced dinner.   The shop was empty, probably due to their reputation. We both ordered a tonkotsu ramen but with different meats. I'm no ramen expert but the taste was fine. Though if they are mixing a soup base with flavoring powders it would have been hard to tell as tonkotsu soup contains pretty much all the flavors of a neutral broth. The only thing obviously wrong was that under the toppings the ramen noodles were still loosely stuck in a circle brick shape,  so they were obviously from a package. A little bit of stirring before calling my order and I wouldn't have noticed.   The tables were clean and the lady taking my order was nice enough. But then again, the place was empty and I knew what I wanted.   I won't be going back because for $10 it isn't a really good value. I'd say at $6.50 for dinner they might have something. In any case,  it wasn't as bad as I expected and I actually enjoyed finishing my soup."}
{"text":"Recently, I've decided to give this place another shot and they pleasantly surprised me! Their teppanyaki is pretty solid and the potion is fairly large. I had the chicken teppanyaki and my friend got the spicy chicken teppanyaki. The only different between the two was a lot of Sriracha on the spicy one but hey it was still pretty good. Now I just need to try the ramen again...  Also worth noting, this time around the staff was way friendlier, which is also a great bonus! :)"}
{"text":"Lunch value is alright. Calamari for 6.99 however had to top it off with mcdonalds as it wasn't entirely filling"}
{"text":"The place doesn't really deserve all the hate it gets. There are problems with some of the ramen ingredients, but generally it is okay and there are strong points of the locale. The atmosphere is nice and modern and the service staff is usually nice. I am a fan of the quantity and freshness of the ingredients used in the ramen. I frequent here and have been to Koto at least 5 or 6 times because of the quantity and flavor. I highly recommend the miso flavored ramen as well as the tonkotsu. The broth is thick and flavorful, especially the miso base. My biggest problems with the ramen bowls are that the meat is always tough and dry. I've had the pork, braised beef, and even the duck, all of which were tougher than the meats I've had at other ramen shops or even meat I cook myself. This leads to the deduction of 2 stars. If you want ramen and a filling quantity and delicious stock, I recommend Koto, but don't expect full authenticity or tender meat cuts."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I forget my first ordered dish but the second time was the Miso Ramen.   Both ramen were flavorless and unappealing. Not very good food. My friends who eat their pork and beef versions of ramen like it alright, but my experience has been awful. I won't make the mistake of going there again."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing, honestly.  I've been eagerly waiting for my first try at Koto Ramen since I spotted the place under interior decoration early in summer. When I actually went there, it was like my ramen dreams shattered.   I have to admit that I'm not an expert in Japanese ramen, but ramen at Koto is not what I wanted. I ordered miso ramen with pork. The broth was kind of like a universal broth with miso paste dissolved. I keep saying to myself \"no they won't charge $9.99 for that kind of inferior mixture\", until a block of undissolved miso paste sickened me.  The standard bowl comes with pretty little noodle, three slices of very thin pork, half a well-done cook egg, and some spare bean sprout and corn kernels. I'd say that they overcharge it way too much.  Customers are responsible to take used tableware to a tray, but wiping the tables clean should be taken care of by attendants. I arrived at 5pm, definitely not rush hour, but the table was sticky and greasy."}
{"text":"Average price, average food. Their ramen is ok; not as good as Sakanaya but also cheaper. I don't recommend their teriyaki."}
{"text":"Since I have lived in Japan for some tinr, I am rather picky about my ramen.   First of all, this place does not offer japanese ramen, even their shoyu broth is.. simply shoyu (soy sauce) and broth.. whereas real japanese shoyu broth is much more than that. I'm Chinese despite my wife being Japanese, so I have nothing against them... but I just want to point out that their ramen is Chinese Japanese fusion. The taste was so so, I had the braised beef topping.   Although customer service was good, food is so so, and price is kind of on the high end for noodles."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this new ramen spot on green street. However, after the first bite I was disappointed. I got the braised pork tonkotsu ramen. The broth lacked any pork flavor and none of the umami flavor you get from a truly good broth. The noodles were far too chewy and not tasty at all. The braised beef by far was the worst aspect. I was expecting the beef to melt in my mouth as it should have, instead i had to tear it apart and chew on it like a piece of gum. Definitely not what you want out of a pork that was supposed to be \"braised\". I didn't come close to finishing my ramen and left Koto Ramen unsatisfied and disappointed.  Don't waste $13 and go to Sakayana across the street for some much better ramen. Actually you're better off eating top ramen for better noodles and a more flavorful broth"}
{"text":"Being from Southern California, I am sometimes leary about going out for certain types of food.  Mexican food is the big one for me.  Asian cusine is the second one depending on where I am.  In New York City,  not a problem.  Champaign Illinois, my hopes were not set to high.  My friends stopped in for lunch each ordering a different item.  I tried the duck and my friends the chicken and beef.  You pcik the size, protein, and broth.  I was not that impressed.  Same thing with my friends.  They make it fresh is a positive thing.  It just did not taste that good.  I hate fowl when the bone is still attached to the meat in a soup.  It is just to messy to pick at the meat.  For the area, maybe 2.5 stars, and that is being pretty kind."}
{"text":"Worst service I ever experienced. I ordered a meal from their list with a nice picture next to it. The plate I finally got had 5 scampis instead of a big pile. The broccoli changed into onions, and so on.  I tried to get a new serving. That was not possible. I tried to get my money back, (had not eaten yet). Did not work. I left!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awful; the food is crappy and tastes cheap, but the price is not cheap. I didn't like the \"veggie\" ramen, which had no veggies and no taste; it was literally like you can make at home but worse and for nine bucks. Also, I tried the squid stir fry, or whatever it's called, and it had no taste, was expensive, tiny in portion and greasy. I'm very disappointed with this place and I think, with such a great location, one can tell that they suck by all the empty seats, all the time."}
{"text":"Like many other reviewers, my ramen shop experience is limited, but hey, noodles, meat and flavored broth, what can be bad about that?  The place seems clean with a cool modern vibe.   I ordered the small chicken ramen with spicy garlic broth. However, the bowl was lacking flavor. It was satisfying in a hot noodles in broth sort of way... like when you're sick and you can't taste much but eating soup makes you feel better.   The most offensive part of the dish was the chicken. Really tough, rubbery and overall not pleasant to eat.   I am not in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"Cool scene but not-so-great ramen. I'm giving three stars instead of two since the meats and porks aren't bad and are served in generous portions."}
{"text":"Ho boy, I was excited for a ramen specialty shop to finally open in Chubana. This restaurant did a superb job in crushing all my ramen dreams.   First off, the neophyte employees don't seem to understand how ramen refills work. First off, you can only order extra noodles during your order. Instead of putting the noodles in an empty bowl, they just add it into your ramen when it's made.   If working on a Monday had a flavor, it would taste like the noodles and broth served here. The noodles tasted fairly mundane and the broth itself was bland. What surprised me was that the Curry chicken ramen I ordered was done Chinese-style rather than Japanese style. What this means is that the chicken in the ramen had bones, so it was fairly annoying randomly biting into bones while I ate my food. Also, the flavor of the broth didn't really resemble Japanese curry; it seems that they tossed some hot spices in the hopes that we wouldn't recognize that it's not Japanese curry.   Also, I was surprised by the rave/trance music playing in the background... I'm no fan of this sort of music, but I honestly wonder if the owners did some sort of market analysis and found out what UIUC students like listening to. It wasn't even good rave music either. They had a rave version of Justin Bieber's \"Baby.\" I don't really have anything against him, but I do question the music selection here.   Not only was stomach absolutely pissed at what I had subjected it to, my wallet was equally furious as well. The ramen bowls cost around $11 each (they normally cost $7-$8 at other places). But when you're the only ramen specialty shop in town, I suppose you can charge whatever you want."}
{"text":"This place just opened two days ago. I was so excited that there was finally a ramen place on campus. I got the chicken curry ramen. I was very disappointed with the ramen here. The broth was not anything special nor were the noodles. Within my ramen, I found small pieces of bone from chicken scatter throughout. Also, the chicken tasted very bland with no seasoning at all. Overall, it is great to have a ramen place on campus, but do not expect it to be amazed with the quality."}
{"text":"the food was pretty good, but they don't know how to package it for take out.  I did expect MORE food, it seems they were scrimping on the amount they give.   The kitchen was manned by some young guys,  And I would suggest they go to culinary 101 to update their skills and learn presentation."}
{"text":"Restaurant review It is amazing how some restaurants can stay in business in Champaign. This is a terrible, non-authentic japanese ramen restaurant that goes wrong is so many different ways. For the price you pay which is equivalent to the price you would pay for Slurping Turtle which is own by a professional chef who makes amazing ramen you would expect something similar but boy how far away from the tree can you get. I had the roast duck ramen which should have been a big red flag already. There is no such thing as a roast duck ramen in Japanese cuisine... in chinese noodle shops this is common. The ingredients were very off including bean sprouts, black wood fungus, and half an egg. Also the ramen texture reminds you of chinese noodles instead of traditional Japanese Ramen. This really is a ramen with a variety of Chinese ingredients. The soup lack depth and flavoring. The only reason why this place will continue to survive is because your options are limited her for authentic ramen experience.... Sigh!  Pros: None  Cons: Terrible ramen, super expensive, you are better off eating at a chinese restaurant  Hidden deals: Hooked app has occasional savings.   Health code rating: B. Lots of health code violations noted http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=2110"}
{"text":"Saw the bad reviews this ramen shop had, but I went here anyway. This is the only ramen place we got in town anyway.   The ramen is bad. The broth is bland. Noodle is hard. Pork taste like rubber. Expensive.  Save your money, and don't even bother to try this guys. Honestly, the instant ramen is much better than what they got here."}
