{"text":"Gad to grab a quick bite at CLT so I opted for the chicken strips and fries at Case Bacardi's takeout window. Best thing about them was that they were quick and hot when they came out. Downhill from there. Perhaps the most tasteless \"food\" I've had in month."}
{"text":"Ordered the vegetarian bowl. It's really strange. It includes rice, brown beans, a ton of squash (cooked), raw carrots and guac. It cost $10.99."}
{"text":"This may be the WORST meal I've had in years. It was the most bland, flavorless food. The menu looked so good, too! I ordered the Jerk Chicken bowl. I could not discern any classic jerk seasoning like cinnamon, allspice, jalape√±o, or vinegar and lime juice. Jerk flavorings are so pointed and tangy. This had zero!!! Even worse, the beans and rice at the bottom of the bowl was a gluey, tasteless mess! So sad, because I was so pumped to have Caribbean food. Cold beers were great, and the staff friendly, but nothing could save the god awful main corse, not even hot sauce. Bummer!"}
{"text":"What a waste of $ 13.52. I had a 3 hrs layover I decide to try there  chicken sandwich. The chicken was over grilled. It was so tough  to chew. My side, which  was rice and bean  taste  like can beans with tomatoe sauce.  I was skeptical  after receiving  my food within  3 mins."}
