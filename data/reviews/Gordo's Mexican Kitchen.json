{"text":"Zero stars. Not worth the time. Dont come here service is absolutely terrible. I sat for 10 mins without anyone asking if i needed anything. The drinks are in cans, really what kind of restaurant is this. I wish that someone had not told me about ths place."}
{"text":"Honey Chipotle is the best!! staff is friendly!! the waiter was really helpful, and you cant beat the price!!"}
{"text":"We ordered on a Sunday evening for pick up during half time during a Panthers game. We live in Lake Park. My husband arrived at the recommended time and found that his order had not been attended to even though there was no one in the restaurant. They also did not have black beans !!  Anyway it was cold -chicken enchiladas -when we ate it as soon as he arrived. Probably won't try again."}
{"text":"Been several times. Clean, affordable, and most importantly, great food. Their chips and salsa are very good, light and crispy chips and salsa done right. The fried entrees such as chimichangas aren't oily or heavy like many places, just flaky and crispy, the way it should be. It's never been very busy when I've gone for lunch, but the staff is very friendly and accommodating. Give them a try, and to the folks who have had less than stellar experiences, give them another chance, everyone has a bad day from time to time!"}
{"text":"Came in on a recommendation for late (1:30pm) lunch. Fast, courteous, attentive service. Delicious food. And the lunch servings were the perfect size for us. We had Chicken Fajitas & Pollo Crema. Our guest had the special: Honey Chipotle Chicken (for which there wasn't a lunch-size serving.) He said he'd probably be getting that again the next time he's in. When we're in the area, we'll likely be back."}
{"text":"Very sad to hear they are closing in Mid June 2017. I've been twice and have enjoyed two delicious meals. Good portions, good flavor, good service and good prices. My mom is particularly picky about her Mexican food and she has asked to go back here multiple times. It's better than your typical run of the mill Mexican restaurants you can find in every city and they I'm sad it's closing :/"}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh food. Hidden gem. Owner is very friendly and works hard at quality of his food. The place is spotless. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"It's a small place but it's one of the best parts about living in Lake Park. Everyone working is always very friendly and accommodating. The food is always excellent. The pollo Adobe is my personal favorite. The chips and salsa are always on point as well. Parking can be a bit slim try to get there during the not so busy hours. The house sangria is also excellent and full of fruit."}
{"text":"I've given this place a few chances and every time I leave I ask myself why did I go again.  The convenience is one thing but that is about it.  My girls love it but considering what they order from there it's satisfies them.  Myself on the other hand I have ordered many different dishes in hopes that something might actually become a fave.  I've had the chicken burrito a couple times now.  The flavor is never consistent and the last time it was overly salty.    The rice is usually dry and tastes old.  The other night I ordered the Gordo's salad.  Menu cost was $7.99.  The size of the salad was a joke.  Yes it was healthy but probably because it was about half the size one would normally see at a restaurant like this.  I left hungry.  Most other Mexican restaurants with the same menu and prices, I can barely finish the salad.   The other night the young server came to our table with headphones in and had to say 'huh' and remove the headphones to actually hear what we were requesting."}
{"text":"We go here at least once a week. The food is great, super fresh. Nice quiet atmosphere (I hate having to yell over dinner!), reasonable prices and portion sizes. Service is exemplary!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for take out because its close to home. It was very disappointing. Everything was very small portions and bland. The salsa tasted and looked like spaghetti sauce from a can, my husband even said what did you get that has sauce? His burrito was small and meat was dry and old with lots of burnt peices. My bean burrito was smaller that a 99cent taco bell burrito and had a kraft single melted on top?? So strange. I could go on...no spice, no flavor and food tasted old. We won't be back or recommend."}
{"text":"Unless you live in Lake Park, you may not even realize that Gordo's exists - I certainly didn't. Even after looking at that map a few times, it took me a while to realize that Gordo's is actually within Lake Park itself and not on a road next to it. To make matters worse, Creft Circle is a loop road (yes, it took me a while to figure that one out, keep it down back there in the peanut gallery), so if you enter on the wrong Creft Circle, you'll have no clue where you are going and instead the only retail you will see is a day care, which looks like it's abandoned after a certain time of day - they may be open earlier.  Once all that is out of the way, and if you get to Gordo's in the correct area of Creft Circle, it's actually a happening little place. In fact, when we have been, it's packed. Partially because it's not big - only a dozen or so tables - so you may need to wait if people are lingering. The good news here is that it's not really a lingering sort of place. Not that they are bad, just that it's more of a street food vibe, not somewhere you want to hang out all night.  The staff will get you seated, and they are very friendly to get you going with your food, which is tasty if not spectacular, and the prices are good for what you get as well. While Lake Park isn't on our regular routine, if we're in the area, we would definitely stop, and for those in Lake Park, I can see how Gordo's would definitely be worth a visit - you could pop in without even having to drive anyplace."}
{"text":"Gordos is a hidden gem!  We stopped in tonight on a bike ride.  We were in the mood for nachos.  Nachos aren't on the menus but the owner said he would gladly make them.  We were so glad he did!  The salsa is delicious and the chips so fresh.  The nachos were absolutely delicious.  We love this place!!!  The quality of the food is so fresh...the service fantastic...the place is clean clean clean.  Great experience.....you need to go if you haven't tried it yet!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Quality food at a very affordable price. Very clean favors. Seating inside and out."}
{"text":"The service was horrible and the food was worse. Bean burrito was soupy. All of it tasted like it came out of a can! Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Louise is by far one of the most passionate restaurant owners I have met. His passion for food and his menu is fabulous. The atmosphere and quality of food is amazing. You have a customer for life.  Nice job."}
