{"text":"Went for lunch here with a couple of co-workers and I was extremely impressed. 

We didn't make a reservation and there was a bit of a line up when we got there. However the people in line ahead of us were seated quickly and there was still a table available for us which was awesome, success since this is next to impossible at most other downtown hotspots.

I ordered a \"little black dress\" martini (black cherry vodka, cranberry and coke) and boy oh boy it was super yummy in my mouth. The color of the drink when it arrived wasn't the best  but the flavor made up for it, AND as a bonus at the end there was a cherry blaster candy in the bottom. Smiles all around.

We all ordered the steak sandwich and it was topnotch! It was cooked to perfection and placed on top of focaccia bread that is covered in aioli. Yummy! plus they place two of the most amazing onion rings on the plate, I don't know what kind of batter they use but it was the best I have ever had. I went with just the mixed green and again the dressing on it was so much better then the standard balsamic stuff other places use. It was loaded with cucumbers, carrots, cherry tomatoes, sunflower seeds I could have eaten that all day!

Overall it's close to work and I definitetly want to go back soon."}
{"text":"Other than new chairs and lighting, I can't say I noticed a difference from the former Redwater. Even my steak sandwich tasted the same...which is not a bad thing. Top marks to the chef for the perfectly done steak!! One difference was some sprinkled spices on my house salad which I could live without.

Unfortunately, the service was lacking despite having what seemed like 3 different people tending to our table or about a dozen. You would think the imposed set 3 course menu would have made things easier. 

It will always be an easy spot for lunch so I won't hold them to the service this one time."}
{"text":"Came here for a weekday business lunch.

I had the taco salad for $18.  Nothing special, just an assembly of normal readily available supermarket ingredients.  No attempt to even justify the ridiculous pricing.  The taco salad at Wendy's for $8 is much better.

Service was below average.  I stood at the entrance waiting much too long to be seated.  They might as well not have a hostess at all.  The waiter wasn't friendly or pleasant, just doing his normal routine...not even eye contact.  Didn't even ask if we wanted another bottle of water when ours was clearly empty.  And when he poured the water into our glasses, he splashed it all over the table and didn't even clean it up.

Will never come here again, and will advise all my business contacts the same.  Too bad, because the location is good."}
{"text":"I arrived at this establishment at 10:15 and was told that they were closed. According to the website they open until midnight. There were patrons in the dive eating & enjoying a beverage but I was told they were closed. Avoid this place if you are hungry or thirsty."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat and very friendly staff. We had the Tuna burger with Caesar salad and yum fries. All tasted very nice. Why no 5th star? The Tuna burger had too much sauce and if was not as good as the Tuna Burger at 25 Degree in LA.
Nevertheless 4 stars is also a good rating and if you are in the area and don't know where to go, you should try this place."}
{"text":"After only two visits this place has become one of my favorites. The service is sublime and the entire menu is drool - worthy. They had a great Valentines meal that my boyfriend and I both thoroughly enjoyed (although my ribs were a touch burnt for my taste). Service was efficient and courteous. I had to come back again, so came for lunch and was not disappointed.
If you are uncertain what to order, I would highly recommend trying the Township Salad. The fruit is juicy and the spinach is crisp. They don't seem to get too busy during lunch, but I'd recommend a reservation if you have 4+ people."}
{"text":"Decent food here! Surprisingly :). For lunch visit I recently tried the Buttermilk Fried Chicken sandwich.  It has a coleslaw on the sandwich with a bit of a bite to the dressing made this sandwich so delicious. But you'll need napkins.   This location is in Bow Valley Square and if it was on 8th avenue where most of the restaurant are, I've a feeling it would be busier. 

Definitely enjoyed the food and will be back to try another plate."}
{"text":"Attended a meeting during lunch and ordered the steak sandwich. All the food was cooked very well and service was very good. This location has had several different ownership changes and I hope they continue the service and quality of food and stay open. Didn't look too busy during lunch and I suspect they get very little traffic during the evening. Good place to eat in Calgary."}
{"text":"Service is always great.... food is kinda meh lately. The cobb salad i had a few weeks ago was horrible but I forgot when I ordered it again without thinking...I mean the discription when you are starved sounds perfect. It was again-gross. Like really: wilted lettuce, chicken kinda rubber and ratio of wilty lettuce to everything is off. My guest had the ahi tuna sandy. He said it was ok... didnt eat it all and seemed a little unsatisfied. I have had the lunch salmon before and its lovely but strange that it is served with a ton of mashed potatoes. Anyways, its Ok. Its not fab. I miss Red Water."}
{"text":"It's a nice bar and grill and they have the usual stuff. The decor is okay but not really impressive. For winters, they have some seating outside which connects to the mall (and could feel like a Patio). The servers and the owner / manager are really nice. For some of the organizations out there in the Suncor building, this is a regular stop and you could seen some familiar faces from work there!"}
{"text":"I was there with some of my colleagues over lunch. I ordered the Chicken Sandwich with a side salad (house salad). It was super delicious, fresh and tasty. The atmosphere was really good, the menu has many options to choose from, Drink menu was also good but did not order any.
The waitress was also great, at the table at all times, very good attitude. Will definitely recommend and will go back again."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cobb Salad.  It was pretty big.  Lots of vegetables, blue cheese, avocado, bacon, big chunks of chicken, 1/2 a boiled egg (still a bit soft in the middle). The dressing was supposed to be Maple Basil.  I opted for Ranch.  I really wanted Blue Cheese Dressing but they didn't have any.  it was a bit bland but did not fancy a sweet salad dressing with my Cobb Salad.  Wait service was great.  Had a bit a line-up outside the restaurant.  Would I come back?  Hmmm...maybe not."}
{"text":"Okay I really wish I could give a better rating for this quaint spot. They have the potential but are not there quite yet. 

My Coworker and I were walking in Downtown Calgary and got hungry so we decided to stop in and see what the place looked like and I must say it looked inviting. We first asked the hostesses for menus and while they proceeded to give it to us, they did not really try to explain what they had nor did they try to explain the menu. Okay I can live with that. We decided to give it a shot and took a seat. The waitress saw that we already had two menus and yet decided to leave two more. 

After taking a look at the menu i decided to have the Township Salad ($12) with Shrimp (+$7). My coworker went with the Township Burger ($9) with cheese and bacon (+$2 each) and Caesar salad (+$2) . 

When the meal came out, the waitress placed it not so gently on the table and walked away without asking if we needed anything. she did not bring ketchup or any dressing for the burger. My salad was tasty but for 7 more dollars you only get 4 pieces of shrimp and yes the shrimp was very well seasoned and tasty... but i needed a few more. The dressing on the salad was very mild and very tasty. it went excellent with the strawberries, grapes, feta cheese, and candied walnuts. 

As to my coworkers burger, it had one strip of bacon, dry and even though she asked for it medium well, it looked (and according to her it even tasted) like it was burnt instead of medium well. the Caesar salad was not very big and it look dry as well. she was halfway done with it before we were actually able to get a hold of the waitress to get Bar-B-Q sauce. Afterwards the waitress disappeared again and did not come back to the table until we had ordered tea and desert from another waiter. 

For desert my coworker decided to have the smores' brownie, When it came out it looked very pretty. when I bit in to it... it was dry and the graham cracker was hard and also close to burnt. unfortunately by that time both of us were ready to leave the place and the bad service. The waitress only had one other table of probably 12 people and to that table she went every 5 minutes or so. Maybe thinking of the great tip she was a lot more attentive to them then to us. All in all I was not very satisfied and can only hope that they get better service, better prices, and better tasting burgers."}
{"text":"This location in Bow Valley Square has changed hands several times in the last decade, and each restaurant that has come and gone all had something decent to offer.
The latest occupant is Township, and I have to give it an \"ok\" rating.
I went for a work lunch, and we all ended up ordering some form of sandwich.
However, two of us ordered the Short Rib open faced sandwich, and it left a bit to be desired.  First, sitting on top of the one slice of bread topped with a mayo-based sauce (sparse and not very flavorful) and a few sautéed onions and jalapenos was a brick of dry meat about 4 inches thick. Even using cutlery it was a struggle to eat this monstrosity. And keep in mind this location is catering to the work-lunch crowd, so how does a lady eat this without looking terrible?
But worse was the dryness of the meat. It was a dense block of epic carnivorous proportions. There was a tiny amount of jus on the plate but it could've used WAY more sauce. And flavor, cuz there really wasn't any.
However, I will give their fries 5*, cuz I chose them for my side dish but didn't intend on eating more than a couple but they were awesome: recently a potato (a rarity for fries these days), fried hot but still soft, and a great amount of sea salt. 
The fried chicken sandwich my coworker had looked pretty good. Perhaps I'll order that if I come back here."}
{"text":"Came here with my colleagues. Its nice that you can enter the restaurant inside the Bow Valley Square. First off, our serve has a really good memory. Didn't have to write the order down at all.

I got the steak sandwich. It was good with only one issue. It was too burnt outside. Too much char on the steak. I wanted the steak medium rare and it did come out as medium rare.  I had it with the Manhattan seafood chowder. The soup was a bit too spicy for me. 

Décor quite nice. 

The place was quite full during lunch time. So remember to make a reservation."}
{"text":"I was at Township Bar & Grill for an office event, but from glancing the dinner and drink menus, and the ambiance of the restaurant I will definitely be back! 

We were in a sectioned off part of the restaurant with about 30 people, and the staff was super courteous. We had a sampler of the appetizers (I believe we had versions of the salad offered on the main dinner menu and other finger foods) from the first few nibbles I can tell the food is a tummy pleaser. 

You're probably thinking, \"Jess, why are you writing this review? You didn't actually eat anything on the menu.\" And to you I say, \"For shame! I'm getting to it...\"

So, I did have Kentucky Lemonade, and it was awesome! I think in the summer on a patio, this would be a refreshing way to cool down. As I was alluding to before, this place IS the perfect place for drinks or a date or drinks with a date! 

It's actually really pretty on the inside. I wasn't expecting it--maybe I was judging a restaurant by its name or something, but I was pleasantly surprised. It has a pinch of glamour and a lofty vibe. I really liked it. And I will be coming back to dine and wine in the very near future."}
