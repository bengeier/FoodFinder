{"text":"Friendly staff, good food at a great price. Always consistent. Breakfast is very good as well."}
{"text":"OK, nothing special. Mint Hill is in real need of a more upscale place to eat, something other than the Greekish diner fare like here and Jimmies. Maybe someday...... Pretty good value for the price, but just average at  best, I've eaten here at least a dozen times and gotten take out more than that just because its convenient to where I live and I'm surprized by the number of folks giving this a 4 or more star rating. They must be limited in their dining experience."}
{"text":"Take out service is the worst, make sure you get the order you placed and not some other one. Dont know why but this is a regular occurence with my familys order.  2 times in one week, is a bit much"}
{"text":"They eliminated an entire row of seating not sure that was a good business decision and the lobby layout is awkward. Same great food, service and reasonable prices. Kudos for the change!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place to go with young children! Babysitting the 3 grands, ages 6,4 and 2--decided to go out to eat on a Friday night.  The food came out just as soon as we sat down.  The staff kept circulating to ask if they could bring us anything.  Could not have been more pleased.  Would recommend this as a very nice alternative to \"fast food\" restaurants.  It was fast--but a lot more menu choices plus great staff."}
{"text":"yay...Showmars... \"Casual Dinning...Fast!\". Well their slogan fits the bill and the food here is always way delicious. I like going for the Gyro myself but they also have awesome pita burgers and Greek salads. I've been to this location a couple times and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Showmars is one of my favorite local restaurants and I'm glad to see them doing as well as they have. If you are looking for a quick, and good, gryo around town this is definitely the place to stop in by."}
{"text":"Nothing but overpriced, low quality food. The male bathroom was absolutely disgusting seemed like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. Service was slow. Truly a miserable experience. WILL NOT BE COMING BACK"}
{"text":"What's on the menu here, flies!! I decided against my better judgement to join some friends here for dinner on July 27th. The fly situation is even worse!!! There were 5 on the menu boards and countless others throughout thr dining area. I left without ordering..... who is ordering from a fly santuary?? How is this place open???"}
{"text":"We love the calabash shirmp dinner and the salads!!! We moved out of town and didn't have a Showmars there, so we take advantage of the\" greek\" fast food experience whenever we can now."}
{"text":"Always great service and fresh food even at the busy times. Smiling faces that come by your table many times to check you drinks and remove dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great staff. I've been there many dozens of times, all times of the day. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are good."}
{"text":"Love running in and out of this place when I'm running multiple errands on a tight schedule. Their mobile menu isn't great so I usually go in and order takeout. The prices are good and their menus offer healthier,  tastier options than typical burger joints. The service is very quick and efficient. The restaurant is clean and well staffed. The portions are generous and packaged well for travel with plenty of napkins, condiments and utensils included without even being requested."}
{"text":"First visit ever.  Tried a famous All American Pita burger.  It was very good, as were the onion rings.  Iced tea (unsweetened) was bland and watery.  A young lady checked on me, and offered to go cups to others for their drinks, but no mention of it when she got to me.  All in all I need to give this place a fair shake, but my first impression was that it was pretty pricey to what really amounted to fast food minus all the paper.  I certainly paid more than other fast food restaurants, not sure what I got for it that warrants the price?"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Great service, wonderful people.   Advice to management: allow tipping on cards. You're robbing your waitstaff of their earning potential by not allowing tipping on cards."}
{"text":"This has been our go to Showmars but overall cleanliness has gone downhill. I mentioned that there were flies everywhere and an employee said they knew that... Also, the light colored woodwork near the kitchen entrance and surrounding floors needs to be cleaned and/or repainted. The health dept score was not in the upper 90's where it needs to be either. Food was typical good value Showmars however."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem at show Mars in mint hill before always had amazing lunch he's and dinners so I decided to try breakfast. I don't know if it was the new staff or new management but they got almost everything wrong and wanted to do nothing about to fix it. We almost left until the manager came to fix half of our order to make it edible for us. He did take 10% off the bill which I thought was low considering we could even eat half our food. But I left it at four stars because there lunch and dinner are worth going to but I'd skip breakfast!"}
{"text":"This Showmars is pretty good. I go there often. The food is always good. I think it can be a bit pricey when you make it a combo (it can be like $12 which is close to a meal at a restaurant like Cheddars) and you won't have any leftovers. Also, this location won't scramble your omelets like other locations will do. The breakfast omelets and potatoes are never seasoned. I have never had one seasoned omelet or potato here. Even if you ask for extra seasoning it literally has no taste. Other than that it's a good place to eat and the staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"Showmars is great. Fast food that doesn't taste like fast food. Gyro's are delicious and the yogurt sauce would make a shingle edible.  I only wish they offered some spicier options, maybe even a cajun french fry or the like. Otherwise a great experience."}
{"text":"Where to start with Showmars, first of all we have been customers since Showmars was in the building with Harris Teeter so a long time and the most recent changes that have driven up the cost are not great. First of all they used to have a $2.99 breakfast special which was the BEST breakfast in town. After the remodel of the restaurant the exact same breakfast is now $5.79, $2.80 increase for the exact same thing really. And I don't know where they get there from but it's gelatinous muck. The lunch dinner menu has also changed and also gone up in price, they have new chicken pitas that are really good and a few new salads which are all $8.59. There are quite a few other restaurants in the area that have a $2.99 breakfast special and hamburger and french fries for less than $10. Showmars just doesn't have the quality to pull of these prices."}
{"text":"As good as any of the other Showmars! They have younger people working at this one but they still did a great job. My food was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Showmars has aways been a staple in restaurants in our area. I went on July 3rd 2017 and although the service was great, the food was not.  Wife and I got the shrimp platter, fries, slaw and hush puppies.   All day July 4th we spend the day on the toilet with diarrhea. Thanks Showmars for ruining our holiday!  I will think twice before going back."}
{"text":"Your fish I ate yesterday was over cooked and hard as a rock. It made me sick all night! Not sure what you have done but it will be along time before I eat there again!  I'm very unhappy and have always been a good customer of yours. I will go elsewhere for fish like South 21.  Seems like every restaurant in Mint Hill just goes to pot after awhile. Mint Hill please get better Restaurante!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Showmars for over 23 years now. Super fast service, always friendly staff and the food is delicious and priced well. they go through renovations and update their menu as well. Outside dining area is nice during the summer"}
{"text":"So, back in a chain. And this time I didn't think this place was too bad. I haven't been to showmars in a while and when I was invited to go while working to eat and I was actually surprised. They had great service and this Showmars gave a feeling of community. Lets face it, it is in Mint Hill.  Overall, I enjoyed this Showmars. Nothing really bad/good to say about it. Nothing special, at the same time it wasn't bad at all. Food came promptly and it was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I visited this location a year ago for lunch. The food was horrible. It tasted like defrosted burgers and fries.  Came back to check out their \"improved\" menu and renovated space.  It is a cleaner and crisper look inside with neutral tones. It was quite busy for a Thursday morning. Our waitress was very nice and attentive despite it being so busy.  My son had the french toast and I had the Farm Fresh breakfast. The bacon was cooked to perfection. The coffee is decent as well. It was actually all very good. I was very surprised.  It has that frequent local vibe to it. Looks like people meet up there to catch up or hang out.  I will have to try them for lunch again and see how that experience goes."}
{"text":"Just like it says, real good food....fast!  Showmars is a great choice if you really just don't feel like the usual fast food but also don't have the time for a sit-down.  Every Showmars I've been to has very friendly and accomodating staff.  Would like to see some more gluten-free items on the menu other than just salad, but for the most part the menu is sufficient.  Great place to grab a bite!!"}
{"text":"Did the shrimp and flounder plate decrease in price? I was suprised when the cost seemed noticeably cheaper. I didn't think much about it , because who doesn't like a cheaper price. However, I thought the shrimp were smaller and the flounder was less flavorful, hands down. I would rather pay more for the better quality fish and shrimp. Overall this platter seemed more like a \"box of fish and shrimp\"...It seemed to be lacking and I was not a huge fan of the new modern interior. I prefered the small-town local art and warmth that this resteraunt has erased. End rant."}
{"text":"Love Shomars food service and cleanliness. Love their salads and food always consistent at this location and quick and well rounded meals. Great variety too. S Britt"}
{"text":"I love getting the tenderloin tip platter here after work. Usually I'm picking my order up at 8:30pm and even though they close at 9pm all the food is hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Food arrived to table within minutes of order. Food appeared and tasted fresh and delcious. Service to table was excellent, checking in numerous times to check on food quality and drink refills. Very please with Showmars."}
{"text":"Somewhat amazingly, I've been to Showmars only a handful of times, I've written two reviews, and this is one of them.  The last one was almost four years ago.  I didn't even realize I had been here before, much less reviewed the place.  I actually stopped in for breakfast one morning because I noticed they had a breakfast special.  I'm all about breakfast, so I gave them a go.  It turns out that Showmars - at least this Showmars - is absolutely packed for breakfast.  I don't know if it's because of the location (their parking lot shares a park-and-ride) or what, but you may want to have some time on your hands.  The service can be spotty.  I've gone in and had to wait a few minutes just to be acknowledged.  I've also gone and been seated right away.  But once seated, the table service is usually very good, and the food comes out quickly.  Also, the bacon is generally some of the best I've ever had - crisp and tasty, not burnt.  They also keep you drinks filled regularly, one of the things I look for as far as service goes.  If you don't like breakfast, I'd suggest the Greek sandwiches - my favorite is the Souvlaki Somora (chicken), but the Gyro isn't bad either.  Other than that, it's just so-so.  Sweet Tea Report:  Thanks to Wild Bill F., I tried their sweet tea - which I hadn't done before for some reason - and it's not bad.  Better than some, worse than others.  Many places find themselves in the middle of the road when it comes to sweet tea, and Showmars is no exception.  You can tell the difference over unsweetened tea, but it could be much sweeter.  Definitely worth a go if you need a fix, but there are better places out there."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain. But it's a local chain, so that accounts for something, right? It's also fast-casual Greek food, not the common chain experience.  Being one of the few MH options, this location is usually very busy. But the staff is efficient and the wait time is minimal. Pitas, slouvaki, gyro, and American dishes (burgers, grilled chicken salads). You don't come here for authenticity, but for a decent, fast, cheap meal.  Pro tip: For take-out, call 10 minutes before and pick it up using their drive-through. It's not an order at the box; you have to call ahead."}
{"text":"I ordered the cheddar and mushroom pita burger with onion rings. It took quite a while to get my order, as my friends were nearly done with their food when i got mine. I shrugged this off due to they most likely make the burgers to order to make sure they are fresh and hot. When my food finally arrived the burger looked good but the onion rings were burnt. I ate my burger, which was actually pretty tasty. I enjoyed it immensely. However, i didn't care for the blackened onion rings. I asked the waitress if she could get me another batch. She went back into the kitchen and when she came back to my table, she informed me that all batches of onion rings look burned. She offered to get me another side but i told her I'd rather have my money back. It was only two bucks and some change but it was the principle (i ended up just leaving the cash on the table for her tip)."}
{"text":"Always enjoying eating at this location. Food is always prepared quickly and staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"I've been sold on Showmars since I started going - so fair warning - both in Indian Trail and Indep. location, so now that I'm in Mint Hill I visited here. I was NOT disappointed! Ordered the Flounnder-Shrimp dinner and it's same great litly breaded flounder and BUNCHES of calabash shrip. Asked for and got WD ffies (im a crispy girl) but must admit the condensation got to them on this long trip (to go) all the way back up Lawyers. Not their fault. As you can see, got everything to go with also:  tartar, lemon, cocktail AND my FAV Red Wine Vinegar. SHOWMARS is great -NON fast food!"}
{"text":"Sooo, like I promised, I went back to Showmars and it was excellent!!! I ordered the flounder and shrimp combo with onion rings. Yes, the onion rings were perfect!, and I have pictures to prove it. Thanks Showmars, for not letting me down a second time."}
