{"text":"I Love this casual fun place. The lobster tacos are delicious and reasonably priced as well. The service was great and quickly served us on a business lunch!"}
{"text":"Dooooo NOT go here. They will LITERALLY take your money. I went with a group of friends on taco tuesday/final basketball game, which i understand gets super busy but a good server doesn't make excuses. My server was very nice but never refilled my ONE glass of water and took her THREE times to bring me a lemon wedge (by the time she brought it I was 2 tacos in of my 3). Finally, my total came to $8.20. I was the only one of my 6 friends paying in cash so i put a $10 bill and .80 cents down. She came back and gave everyone else their cards and walked away! She still owed me $2 and she just took them! I honestly wasnt even going to tip her but LUCKILY FOR HER she got to STEAL my $2, way to go Kenadee!"}
{"text":"Fun bar, def laid back and staff is legit.   I usually start at this place when I hit scottsdale. Dress is casual so it makes the night easier and more comfortable personally. I'm not a fan of getting dressed up.  They have a decent size patio which is nice for outdoor day drinking and food is pretty good."}
{"text":"discourteous waitresses. food not all that good. if you have to have a drink on a late weekday night - come here."}
{"text":"Delicious Mahi Mahi Tacos! I love that they have late night chips and salsa. For the most part, this is our pre-game spot for friday and saturday nights. They even have my favorite Tequila, Cruz Tequila! Cruz is always a good start for us and they make the best margs with it. Good service but sometimes the bar gets really crowded.  A + in my book"}
{"text":"Loco is by far one of the best bars to come to TEMPE! The guys and gals are great. But another great point is if you are looking to go to a spring training game or a mid summer d-backs game it's in the perfect location. With the floor to ceiling windows and a patio you can enjoy in the AZ sun you can always feel like you are outside without the heat... Sweet tacos!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Wandered in on a weekend afternoon and it was all about the game(s)... So our service was fine, but not really friendly or attentive.  Tips were obviously going to be made at the men tables, oh well. We read the reviews about the crispy tacos and they were ..... Okay.  So that was disappointing. All in all, it was okay, with the other restaurants in this neighborhood, we could have chosen much better!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast skillet, not going to lie I saw the cleavage from the parking lot and it was the reason I stopped in. Pretty good atmosphere."}
{"text":"All I can say is Blah! Service is horrible. It took forever for our food to come out. I got the fish tacos and they were super breaded and hardly any fish. If you know real Mexican food, I wouldn't recommend Loco Partone."}
{"text":"Food took forever to arrive,  but it was awful.   Came on a football Sunday for a late lunch with a large group,  place was busy but there were still empty tables.  The Cardinals game was being played at a deafening volume,  it was louder than the stadium.  Margaritas were mediocre and the salsa was bland.   Once ordered, food took an hour to arrive.   My burrito had very little meat and lukewarm at best.   Almost noone got through more than half their meal as the taste was subpar.  The only person who had good things to say about the food quality was my daughter who ordered a house salad.   Even though that day it was kids eat free,  I was charged 4 bucks for the salad since it wasn't oredered off the kids menu.   I had not eaten here in quite awhile as the experience had slipped quite a bit from when they first opened,  seems the slippage has not yet stopped.  So I get to end 2015 with my worst dining experience of 2015, hope 2016 is better.  This is the first one star review I have left on Yelp."}
{"text":"Had a friend in town from Jersey and went to old town to watch the NFL games. First place was full so went into Loco Patron and was there all day from morning games to the Sunday night game. Our server Ashley was the best and big reason for the review because of her service food was good, and beers non stop flowing. Would definitely go back to watch football again. Even when it got crowded it didn't feel like as much as the first place."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a nearby hotel employee and they did not disappoint. Great atmosphere, sports on several TVs and friendly service. I had the chicken poblano enchiladas and can't remember the last time I was so impressed by an enchilada. I normally add salsa to all of my Mexican food but the sauce that came with this dish was so good I ordered chips (free) for the salsa. This place is a must try if you're in the mood for Mexican!"}
{"text":"The bartender refused to serve my friend a water because she wasn't buying anymore drinks."}
{"text":"Went out for tacos tonight! Best tacos I've had in Ahwatukee in a long time. I love Loco Patrons environment and customer service. Our server, Bri did an outstanding job. Drinks were always full, never forgot about us and always had a smile on her face! She was so fun to talk to! Keep it up Loco! See you next Tuesday!"}
{"text":"I come to this place every Friday with the kickball people. Donella has served us from day one and she has been nothing but amazing! We are always happy when she is here because she is a great server and can always put a smile on our faces! And she answers my random questions, it's great! Thanks loco"}
{"text":"The lobster tacos were awesome. The service was horrible and the music was loud and annoying."}
{"text":"They had me at waffle fries and carne asada. Man they take carne asada fries to a whole other level here. It's not your typical carne asada fries you get at filibertos or any of his cousins shops. The cheese is like gravy, everyone has to try it you'll never want it any other way. And they have decent drink specials. The margaritas aren't pre made because it was super strong the next round.   The chicken wings are good and their enchiladas are good too. I gotta try their pork tacos next time since there's a huge trophy outside for first place at the taco festival. If you're expecting authentic Mexican than this is not the place but the food is still very good. The chips and salsa weren't all that great. The chips seemed stale and the salsa was watery.   This place is clean. It's about what you would expect out of a bar/restaurant on the boardwalk, it definitely has that feel when you are inside. Service is good and I bet this place is great at night. Perfect drunk food.    I would recommend the Carne Asada waffle fries!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday No more,   prices doubled.  Well it's sad when a business ends a promotion that has treated them so well,  what's worst is coming to a place regularly for Taco Tuesday , for Tacos and Margaritas and ordering your normal order then getting the bill and seeing the prices doubled.  SAY IT AIN'T SO JOE.   You think our bartender or waitress would have mentioned something, when we brought it up to the Manager Joe , he just said it wasn't his decision and shurrugged his shoulders.    So frustrating might be time to find a new place while the bar stuff is good looking they are always looking at their phones and not their guests.   Something wrong with this generation that doesn't know how too work hard.   As for the food. Still good enough. Worth a stop but unless your hot 18 to 23.   Don't expect any service.    Love the pork tacos and salt and pepper wings are a tasty twist.  Food always holds it ownevne if they doubled their prices on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"The food here is really good for bar Mexican Food.  The crunchy tacos are the best.    The wings are good , but get the salt and pepper wings.     The staff is always friendly and they have a bunch of hot people working there could use another girl or two behind the bar, but all the dudes are ripped.    Catch a Margarita from Jeremy, Lance or Jacks and Monti  make a good duo and help with all the drinks.   If you like hot dudes, strong drinks, good beats, and lots of TVs for games.  Go see the guys at Loco Patron.          Free Chips and Salsa always a nice bonus.    GREAT HAPPY HOUR !!!"}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out because we wanted to bring our dog somewhere with us. The only reason I am giving this less-than-mediocre spot two stars is because of the first host we met (she was incredibly friendly and helpful with our dog) and that the service was decent by our waitress.  I would like to give a heads up to anyone who is thinking about coming here. The second + basket of chips and salsa is an extra charge, so you may want to think twice about coming here with a large group. Any Mexican food restaurant who charges for extra chips......red flag initially up.   The scene was decent, but the drinkers were obnoxious. The environment was very loud, which is okay...it is a bar. The service was prompt, almost too prompt from the time the waitress knew we were only ordering one drink each. The food was horrendous. I ordered chicken fajitas....extremely bland, rice tasted like it popped out of the microwave, and it was a little bit pricey for what we got. $5.00 extra if you wanted shrimp.   Obviously, with our dog, we were situated outside. The misters were on, awesome....but a man came while we were in the middle of our meal to \"put the umbrella down\" since it was sunset. Well, the water accumulated from the misters on top of the umbrella came down. The man was careful, but come on, DURING our meal? He decided to wait until later to situate the umbrella after about 10 minutes of fidgeting with it, and it continued to heavily drip water on my boyfriend.   I would absolutely not recommend wasting your money here. We could have easily gone to a much nicer restaurant for about $10.00 more."}
{"text":"Great tacos and great beer for a good price, and in a great location. Doesn't get much better than this on a tuesday."}
{"text":"Dope spot...if you're here for breakfast grab the eggs and enchiladas... And the bottomless mimosas... Won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This comment was made by William Duffy in reference to two African-American children fighting on Facebook. It was totally disrespectful! This review is pertaining to his character...not his business. SEE ATTACHED PHOTO"}
{"text":"Good tacos, also cheese crisps, too noisy at times, pretty good service (new girl is attentive to went you want help)--after nightfall gets a little rough (bartender should cut some off)"}
{"text":"Service was good, but as for the food it was ok. Nothing special, we ordered the steak nachos and buffalo shrimp......the steak was cut so small it was the same size as the black beans. It seems like a cool place for drinks but that's really it."}
{"text":"Service was bad even for a bro bar.  Found this place while looking for food shortly after the Super Bowl. Big banner out front said \"Super Bowl Party till 2am\". The bouncer assured us the kitchen was still open and invited us in.  The place still had a few people in it but no problem getting a bartender right away and asking for a menu with our drinks. We then looked over the menu and purposely ordered something that would require a minimal amount of effort to make and clean up in case the cooks had already started to close down the kitchen. That was the last time we ever talked to our bartender or any other staff in the building.  After about 20mins I personally went to check on the status of our nachos as the kitchen is open for the public to view. I saw the forgotten nachos burnt under the heat lamp. We were the only people to order food so I can see how it might be easy to forget. I mentioned something to a cook to remind him about the nachos then went back to my empty drink at the bar. Another 10mins or so before the cook took initiative and delivered us a plate of nachos that was not only burnt but now had been sitting so long they were cold. I might add the toppings were pretty light. Its a stretch to label this plate of chips \"nachos\". By now the crowd had dwindled to mostly employees on or off the clock. It took another 10mins or so before anyone wearing a loco patron shirt came to check on us. I then told the bartender to forget about the nachos and bring the bill for the drinks. No wait on that.   If you want to just close down and have an employees only party then drop some hints before i waste precious time thinking I've found food and drinks still open on a Sunday night. Take down your signs that boast you'll be open till 2am. And if you forget someone's nachos and get called out on it, have the decency to at least reheat and sprinkle some fresh tomatoes on those stale ass chips before serving them."}
{"text":"First time actually coming to this restaurant and I have to say it was awesome!  The food was wonderful and (most) of the people working there were very helpful and friendly!   I came in with a few buddies for dinner one night, and I wasn't disappointed. Our server was Haley I believe, adorable little red head that was so bubbly and upbeat I'd come back just for that simple fact. She continually kept us in conversation we loved getting her mad about hockey!  She recommended her favorite drinks and told us all of their happy hour prices, and after telling her we liked IPA beers she immediately came back with two samples for us to try out.  Being unfamiliar with the menu she quickly suggested the crunchy pork tacos and even said if we didn't like them the meal was on her! Needless to say we loved every bit of it!   Went outside to smoke a couple times and one of the bartenders was just as nice as our server! I don't believe I know her name (also a red head) but it seemed like she really knew what she was doing! Along with a male bartender assisting her. They both talked the heads off the people sitting at the bar and seemed to have real personal connections with everyone there.  All in all I loved this place, I'll be back and bringing friends just on the service alone! It all seemed so friendly, and everyone knew everyone our server stopped at almost every table to talk or ask about their food.  Only thing I will say is that their were a couple people that we're working that seemed to have attitude problems, one of the girls that brought us our food seemed to be quite rude, and she was glued to her phone, also don't know her name. But she looked like she was balding on one side?   The reviews on this place are way too harsh for what it actually is! I loved the bar all together and I'm giving it a 100% 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"Have gone during the day for nachos, or in the evening to meet friends.  Every Time the staff is always courteous & friendly, even when really busy.  Nice to sit outside while the weather is still nice.  Glad to see local businesses thriving and doing well."}
{"text":"Grilled chicken tenders, salt and pepper wings, and carne asada waffle fries are AWESOME. Street taco are my favorite. The best drink on mill... Blaster!! (Off menu)"}
{"text":"place is still great. new workers and far better service! food is always great!"}
{"text":"We have visited this restaurant in the past and it was decent as my daughter's friend worked there as a waitress so the service was great.  On this occasion we had no friend who was working and the experience was like night and day.  Service was okay except for the wait for the food.  We were the only people in the place and the cook and another cook looked like they were reinventing the wheel (we ordered tacos). They had too many puzzled facial expressions and it took forever.  We finally got our food and it was wrong; back to the kitchen it went.  The corrected food was brought to us promptly but it was unrecognizable if compared to the menu.  The taco shells were stale and massed produced-Ortega grocery store brand is tastier.  My steak taco looked like hamburger meat but was told that it was indeed \"grated\" steak? (aka ground chuck). More lettuce than meat-see photo.  Proceed at your own risk...  If you want a good Loco Paton experience try the one by ASU"}
{"text":"Hello Arizona.   Just flew in from Hawaii and went to this spot to have a few (a lot).   Service is slow.  BUT if you go to the bar, it's on point.  Or maybe they don't have servers.  I dunno. None came by after dropping off the FREE salsa and chips.  Yeah. Free!!!! Is that a thing here in AZ?  Cuz in HI you have to pay for chips.  I know right?! Wtf?  Anyways. I'm not a margarita kinda person. But theirs is on point.  However. I was ordering double Jacks on the rocks all night. Figured I would ask how much the shots were.  $4!!!!!  Oh Arizona. I am gonna like it here."}
{"text":"Food Is the best, I usually go to the one in old town but I tried this one out and not as friendly as the one in old town, but def recommend because the drinks and food are delicious!"}
{"text":"Can't really go wrong with chips and salsa, $3 mexican beers and fajitas!  The service is always great.  Somehow I end up here on Sundays with my Mom and boyfriend for beers and lunch.  We watched the final World Cup game there, which was super fun."}
{"text":"Ahh the sweet life sitting at the bar doing beer curls eating chips and salsa watching the games and enjoying the happy hour grub this place rocks! ! I have been a Chef for 20 years and know good food,  they have a different special each night and they have craft beers also during spring training it's totally crazy plus they have a smoking section for those that imbibe do yourself a favor and drop on by year won't be disappointed! !"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times since moving to the east valley and the food is always great. They have happy hour all day Wednesday's now, which we were pleasantly surprised to see after stopping in on a whim. Try the tostada bites! Our server, Claudia, was attentive and charismatic."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots on mill. Amazing food, great service, and the owners are super cool. The UFC fights are free and taco Tuesday is the best deal around with seriously the best tacos."}
{"text":"Oh I love this place there very kind the burritos  are very well portioned and very tasty I love the salt n pepper wings. wow and waffle fries"}
{"text":"This review is strictly on quality of food.  This place is not authentic Mexican restaurant. I bought a torta del pastor and was not close being a regular torta."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all the negative reviews of Loco. I think it's a great spot to hangout that's slightly less low key than the rest of the Old Town bar scene. I frequented this place with both girl, guy friends and my boyfriend and never did anyone complain. Convenient location that's close to all that old town has to offer.  Crowd ranges from ASU kids to older folks but is often a nice mix. My only complaint would be that on Thursday or Friday nights there is sometimes a wait for a drink if you don't sit at the bar. Killer margaritas and a really nice patio to hang out on a warm night. I try to go back whenever I'm back on my old stomping grounds in AZ."}
{"text":"Loved the Queso. My family recently dined at Loco the food was good and we had a great time and our sever Katherine was engaging and very friendly. We will definitely be back for Sunday football and those Mimosas"}
{"text":"I've walked by the loco patron several times on my way to a sandwich shop. Today I decided to give it a try. It was moderately busy but not loud.  Walked up to the bar and was instantly greeted by the bartender. Hugh selection of tequilas and draft beer. Too bad it was lunch time and I have to go back to work. I had a smothered burro and a street taco. I would come back for the taco alone.  Tasted fresh and looked great. The red Chx burro was flavorful but a little too wet for my taste.  Great atmosphere and with the cooler weather it is a nice place to grab lunch on the patio."}
{"text":"I always have a blast when I go to Loco on mill! Great music, amazing staff, and awesome margaritas...I love it :)"}
{"text":"We have been waiting to try this place for some time as we heard mixed reviews about it. Here is my take on it based on my experience today. We went there at 6pm, it wAsnt crowded and they have a policy \"sit yourself\". We walk to go sit on the patio and found a nice spot ( alhough the high chairs are not comfortable). Server wAs nice and quick. We ordered drinks, nachos and tacos and enchiladas. Nachos - i would give it 3/5 because i didnt like the steak and cheese wAs more creamy philadelphia cheese rather than the melted usual. Tacos- canne with 2 sides ( i got what they called mashed potatoes and spanish rice): the potatoes are not mashed, theyre small roasted potatoes. The rice was ok.  Grilled shrimp and grilled mAhi tacos were good but not the best in Scottsdale.  Enchilladas were average.  Its a hangout place with TVs and music. The food is average."}
{"text":"New ownership, new vibe. Better service. A popular destination for those living in the Tukee Foothills. The food is good, the drinks are cold. The patio view is the best place in Ahwatukee to have a happy hour drink. $1 tacos on Tuesday can't be beat!!"}
{"text":"Try the \"Loco\" hot dogs.... 2 dogs with pico and jalapenos wrapped in bacon.... I had mayo on mine... Good stuff!!"}
{"text":"Doordash is the real reason this review was originally low.  The owner has reached out to me and I am very impressed with their concern for my bad experience.  Going to give them another try."}
{"text":"Love the $1 tacos on Thursdays.  Good food, and the wings alone will make me come back on Wednesdays for Wing Wednesdays.  Genevieve was an outstanding server and the suggestions were spot on - we loved the tacos, and the Pineapple Jalepeno wings had the perfect balance of hot and sweet.  Nice place - kind of trashy (in a good way), and kind of homey - nothing pretentious about the joint.  Love it!!"}
{"text":"call it blasphemy but I like happy hour on the patio here a little better than salty's.   don't care much for the interior."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a drink for happy hour...but that's about it. Food is an afterthought and rates somewhere in between Chipotle and On the Border."}
{"text":"If you were a Viking King... NO... If you were one of the nine Japanese Dragon Gods or Ryuujin himself... and you were burned out on sushi and wandering around Mill AVE in Tempe, AZ, you'd be hard pressed to find a more hospitable and delicious establishment than Loco Patron. Do yourself a favor and order the Buffalo Chicken Mac and Cheese. You are a GOD too... and you deserve it. If you are lucky enough to order it from Tanner or McKenna you will be truly blessed by their awesomeness and love. Do yourself a favor and frequent this establishment. Your life will do nothing but improve."}
{"text":"I never give a one-star rating unless it's duly deserved, and this one IS. Went for something to eat and whatever it was that they brought (we ordered their \"famous crunchy pork tacos\") was stone cold, tasteless, and a disgrace to the country of Mexico. Couldn't even eat it. The \"salsa\" was probably, no it WAS, the worst attempt at salsa I've ever had and the only way I can describe it properly would be weak tomatoey something put in a blender and whipped into a foam with plenty of water added. No taste and another disgrace. Disinterested waitress added to the fun. A total waste of time and money and you couldn't drag me back screaming. I never thought you could screw up a taco, but this guy \"cooking\" did it. Even Chipotle can make a taco that puts this crap to shame. Go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I'm so in love with the tacos here it's insane, not to mention the margaritas!!! Environment is nice and clean, service is great and coming here is always a party!!"}
{"text":"I eat here 2-4 times a week for lunch. The staff know just what I want and my order is always spot on. The lunch card is great, I love when that free lunch comes up. Even when they are packed they spend the time not making you feel rushed. The smashed potatoes are worth going there for alone."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with friendly staff, great food, especially the crunchy tacos! Also have a great drink selection and the margaritas are a must have. Highly recommended if your looking for a some quality Mexican food."}
{"text":"I think this place is better than people make it out to be!  Great prices, good food, great music videos being played in the background, and a good crowd.  While the chips and the fajitas were average or above average, the best part is requesting all the hot sauce accompaniments they have available.  I would recommend the Habanero sauce if you like spicy food, it is good on everything!  This is a great staging spot to have a little dinner and have a couple drinks before heading out for the night.  I will be a regular here."}
{"text":"We hit Loco Patron after soccer skills camp at Desert Foothills Park. Just a short walk up from the park, across the street and through the parking lot, so we we were thirsty and hungry.  We got our usual table in the middle of the bar area.  Kelly took care of us for a second time. She remembered us and treated us wonderfully!  She is an awesome server, great with our kids!  Kelly gave us a hard time and really made our night out fun.  We were able to use a check-in for drink special, but unable to use the 1/2 off appetizer (we wanted wings and wings were already their daily special). We enjoyed the atmosphere, food and plethora of TVs for the sports fans we are!  Our food was served warm and delicious. We shared fajitas, fish tacos, an enchilada plate and of course, (if you've read any of our other reviews) French Fries!  Our son loves French Fries, thinks he's a connoisseur!  He rates the fries from each place, just as our daughter rates California rolls!   We had a good time, I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Chill spot. Delicious food. Awesome craft beer selection and friendly staff. Great place to go to, especially if you're wanting to watch a sporting event."}
{"text":"Great tacos. Beer margaritas are fantastic. Great staff. Great location. Huge dining area. Clean bathrooms. Patio is great for smoking. Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Loco on mill since they opened. I love coming here especially on Sundays for football. They have all the games on, great bloodys, and awesome breakfast!  Loco is my local watering hole and I always have a great time with the staff."}
{"text":"Murder mystery dinner... Walked into the restaurant and the servers stare right through you.  Waited a few minutes and finally sat myself.  Another few minutes goes by before someone even comes to table albeit looks very annoyed.  Placed orders for taco Tuesday ordered a variety of tacos while snacking on chips and salsa in a bowl that only serves about two bites.  20 min later receive good with nobody coming by in the meantime to refill drinks or refresh chips and salsa.  Look at food and notice some have avocado after explicitly telling server that it could not be there due to food allergy.  My co-worker did not even receive the right tacos that he ordered.   Brought it up as we were asking for check as this was the only time we saw our server and Was not offered to be comped for the mess up. The only reason this place gets two stars was because the tacos that I could eat were actually pretty good. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. The Mexican street cart tacos are so good, as are the protein bowl and fajitas. The servers, however, are so incompetent. And the music is ridiculously loud. I recommend patio seating if possible."}
{"text":"I love the tacos here. Taco Tuesday is awesome and I love to go here but there is always lack luster customer service. Tonight was especially awful. The bartenders were all on their phone and I found out that the bartender (Joe) had named our tab, which he should have had split; children.   What was turning into a weekly trip for tacos is now the last time I'll ever set foot in a loco patron and I'll advise my friends to go elsewhere.  As far as the neglect from the people working there, it's guaranteed to happen."}
{"text":"Great specials and an awesome atmosphere! The owners always have something fun going on whether it's a corn hole tourney, bouncey house, game day specials or bands. The prickly pear margarita and shredded chicken tacos are a must order!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and it wasn't too busy but being in a rush, we thought the service took a little long. The menu is large and they have great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Loco Patron has the best seafood tacos in town!!  Whether you go with the grilled mahi or the grilled shrimp, you will not be disappointed!  They are cooked perfectly and then served in warm corn tortillas and dressed with shredded cabbage, cheese and yummy sauce that I can't quite pin down yet.    They have great lunch specials, and the service is always quick.  If you like tostadas, theirs is quite unique, they top them with a creamy avocado sauce...yum!  They also make a mean Chambord Margarita, and the patio is a great place for people watching when the weather is nice.  Of all the Mexican themed bars in Old Town, Loco Patron is my first choice to grab a taco and a margarita!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for some drinks at Loco Patron. The margaritas were great and brought to the table quickly.  Service was great. It was nice hanging with friends and having a drink during a wonderful February day out on the patio. I just wish the drinks were slightly cheaper."}
{"text":"Loco Patron is a must if you are looking for  authentic Mexican food and drinks. This resturant located in the historical downtown Scottsdale has a cozy welcome atmosphere. Indoor or outdoor patio dining.  Our server Katherine F was excellent she, was very helpful she explained the menu and how the food is prepared. L had the lettuce tacos and watermelon Margarita, delicious! Loco Patron has great week day specials... Happy hour Monday through Friday 2:30-6:30  Margarita Monday  Taco Tuesday  All day happy hour Wednesday  5 Star for local and vacationers!"}
{"text":"Normally enjoy Loco. However on my last visit, they refused us service after we had already been seated with no good reason. The manager on duty didn't even come talk to us to explain why. Real professional. All we were told by the disrespectful security guard was someone didn't want us there... ? What a great way to run a buisness! I am in the service industry, and me or any of my friends will never come back or recommend this discriminating establishment ever again!"}
{"text":"Absolute nightmare. We had a large group but that was no excuse for the poor customer service. Took over 15 minutes to get drinks. Had to get our own chips and salsa. Food orders were wrong. Drink orders were wrong. Completely forgot someone's order. Avoid at all costs. Much better options to choose from in the neighborhood. Wouldn't be surprised if it was closed soon. Wish I could give it zero stars."}
{"text":"OK, this is not a hole in the wall Mexican place but it will do.  The staff is usually helpful in making recommendations."}
{"text":"Our hotel recommended this as a good patio, happy sp.ot.  I would say different. our waitress started off helpful and nice. She brought our drinks out fast along with chips and salsa. That is where it stopped. we never ever saw her again. Ever. We asked management, still no one. We had a qu estion about the salsa, why fizzy? No ideaswe left what we thought our drinks cost and headed over .cien agaves and I would give 5 stars. I do worry that our waitress fell of the planet? Hope she landed somewhere safe."}
{"text":"Great locayion and love the fire pit! However, shrimp on happy hour menu was terrible. We could smell it before it hit the table."}
{"text":"Me and the work gang are always in search for great Taco Tuesday places. This is a great Taco Tuesday place. Wonderful selection, great food, low bill - can't ask for anything more. Haven't been any other day or night, so can't talk to that, but if you are looking for a new Tuesday lunch spot, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Very cool bar on a Sunday. $3 beer specials and pretty ladies hanging out. I did not partake of the food this time so no opinion on that. I'll be back some day."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Love the salsa! Just like our restaurant back home in New Mexico!!"}
{"text":"I was refused service by a bartender last night. Myself and a friend walked into the establishment asking for 2 glasses of water. The bartender ignored my two polite requests for water and thereafter stated \"I can refuse service to whomever I choose.\" After changing my order to a sprite and water (to pay for some form of service) he asked to see my identification. I asked to speak to the manager and he claimed to be the manager. I wished him the best of luck in his endeavors and quietly left. I used to frequent this place,  as I am a student, however I will not step within 10 feet of this place."}
{"text":"Yes, this place gets packed as a bar in the evening hours, but peel away all that, and you have a decent Mexican restaurant.  I have had the burritos, enchiladas, and tostadas.  All good.  The guac there is especially good and pair great with a Mexican beer, but then again, what doesn't go well with a Mexican beer.  I will be back."}
{"text":"We went to dinner at L.P. last Monday and were really disappointed. We sat ourselves, then waited for awhile before anyone came to take our order. The food was pretty good, but then after we had our check for about 15 minutes, I finally stood up and started looking for the waiter, who hadn't appeared. Another waiter asked me \"What's wrong?\" and I told him we wanted to pay and get out of there. He took the check, apologized for the wait and finally came back with change. Our original waiter seemed to have gone home. Bad service for a rather slow day. Won't go back."}
{"text":"So glad to have a place like this nearby. It's a neighborhood hangout that has open air indoor outdoor bar area and good food. Service is slow at tables good at the bar."}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered tonight, food is ok, had some complications with out order that really could have been easily avoided. Kitchen is either busy or disorganized seemed like a ton of young kids. Either way.. Won't be back.  Also bartender is very rude. Completely ignored us purposefully.   Manager: very nice person, accommodated us!   Food: decent   Location: cool  Will not be back here which is a shame cause we just moved her and always looking for new places."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Loco Patron Tempe, and been visiting this location twice a week or more for over a year. It helps that I work upstairs in the building :). The food is always excellent, the server staff is exceptional espicially Alicia and McChrista, the atmosphere is always inviting.  The new menu (adopted from the Scottsdale location) is good, the new street tacos are excellent but I miss my Monday lunch special (3 enchiladas). Change is inevitable, so I adjust my priorities and move forward. This review covers the past when I should have posted glowing reviews many times, espicially during the FIFA World Cup. I highly recommend this location to many of my friends and co-workers with much enthusiasm.  They are not perfect, hence 4 stars, during busy times the server and kitchen staff can create longer wait times as they race to satisfy everyone's needs. May I suggest a cool iced tea or adult beverage of your choice and RELAX while you wait. The food will be well worth it once it arrives! Thanks for listening.      A long time loyal fan"}
{"text":"We use to come here for taco Tuesday's but there has been so much change that we don't bother. The last few times we have gone the food has been so salty and greasy. The service ranges from fair to horrible and it's not like they were super busy. Too bad to see this place go down as we don't have a lot of choices out here in the foothills."}
{"text":"Not bad. Great lunch, very nice happy hour and the patio is an ideal spot to sit and consume tasty adult beverages..or soda pop, if that's what you're into..doesn't make ya a bad person.. I believe it gets a little douchey at night but it is oldtown..Try the fajitas.."}
{"text":"Mik was a very attentive bartender, and all of our needs were expeditiously met. Food was fresh and tasty. Definitely a nice weekend venue to relax with friends."}
{"text":"Good things about Loco Patron: has a nice sized patio; has a chill vibe making it a good spot to have a low-key drink on a nice day.   Bad things about Loco Patron: THE SERVICE. There is a certain nepotism that occurs at Loco whenever you go. If you know someone there, you can get good service. If you don't, you will wait a long time to get acknowledged at the bar or at a table. Also, their employees drink there on their time off, and they always get served before the other customers. I've actually seen an off-the-clock employee attack a customer that was leaving. The customer got kicked out while the body guards protected the employee doing the attacking.   I can excuse a bar for having bad food (most bars do), or for have expensive drinks (it is Old Town), but I cannot excuse the blatant favoritism and poor treatment they doll out to customers. I went on a many a day to Loco, but after being treated poorly many times I will never go back. There are plenty of other spots in Old Town that will deliver similar experience, without crappy service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Loco Patron tonight for taco Tuesday.  We were so happy we did.  From the hostess to the servers to the amazing food...all were super.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place, the food served is not what is described on the menu, they are cutting  corners to save money. Service at the bar is decent,  drinks are average.  There are many better places in this valley, we won't be back..."}
{"text":"Terrible service, don't recommend. Will not comeback. Server had a attitude. Bouncer were rude."}
{"text":"I had tacos. They were amazing. I had the pork on corn tortilla with rice and beans on the side. The rice and beans were average but the taco was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Tacos are decent size mad were good (not great).  The Caliente Salad (with steak) was very good. The vinaigrette dressing was very flavorful and tasted great. Had two of the spicy margaritas (name?). The \"salsa\" was making me skeptical but the drink tasted great."}
{"text":"I love the enchiladas and crunchy tacos at this place the best I've had in Phoenix metro since I moved here 25 yrs ago  keep up the good work  PS. The Marg was awesome"}
{"text":"Avoid the rowdy college crowds and hit up Loco Patron on the north end of Mill Ave.  Great Happy Hour specials on food and drinks, plus It goes from 3-7pm.  The food here is the hidden secret, try the \"award winning crunchy pork tacos\" or the Mexican street cart tacos, my two favorites.    My friends and I always hit up Loco Patron for Taco Tuesday, sporting events, or any other special events on mill Ave!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I think this is the best place in Scottsdale for Taco Tuesday. It's simple, the portions are great and the price is more than reasonable.   They do not attempt to be bougie like some of the other restaurants in this area. LP provides a comfortable atmosphere with sports playing on several of their TVs and they serve a great taco menu including a variety of fish, mahi, beef and chicken tacos.   If anyone is looking for a quick place to eat that is a great bang for your buck, this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"Chips and Salsa seriously suck !  Also, pretty sure our waitress was drunk the whole time.  Service and Food sucks.  DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"The longer Loco has been open the better the service has gotten.  You have to ask for it, but they will bring you a green salsa that is much better than the red salsa for the chips, it has a lot more flavor."}
{"text":"In town for the PGA Champions golf tourney and looked in Yelp for Mexican food. Loco Patron's was an Awesome choice. Great service, great food, great set up. Good job guys!!"}
{"text":"Tacos are fantastic. Good beer selection. Plenty of TVs. Great staff."}
{"text":"Accidently found this while hungry after a meeting. The tacos were awesome! Got three different kinds to compare and my wife and I agree that each were excellent! A bit busy but that's good that people were clamoring for seats. The enchilada with red sauce is pretty standard. The refried beans were tasty and the chips and salsa felt homemade. Could've used more drink but waitress was busy. Only reason for the 4 stars. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place had a very fun atmosphere and I'm getting old. It was definitely a place for young people but I really enjoyed being there and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is the best! Can't beat the prices. The Arizona burrito is awesome too."}
{"text":"Every time I have been here, the staff has been extremely rude. Granted, I am  a decade past 21 and this spot may be a bit young for my tastes.  Not a big fan of plastic and got a happy hour margarita with and the \"plastic\" glass was chipped and scratched all to hell. I asked for a new one since I cringed everytime I tried to get a bit of salt.  The Bartender was obviously irritated and replied..\"It's plastic!\"  then grabbed a new glass sans salt and poured it in.  NICE!"}
{"text":"I really only come here for Taco Tuesday. Sometimes it's just myself and my husband, other times we have as many as 15. Service is pretty decent, they are great about splitting checks. They have food runners bring out the food so it's always a food auction. But, for dollar tacos, who can complain? The salsa is on the watery side, but it definitely has good flavor and doesn't stop me from eating it. It's nice that it's complimentary as well.   I don't get here as often anymore because we moved from old town, but we still make the drive sometimes for taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"I saw some older negative reviews here. They're not true now. Guys named Billy & Edward own and operate the place now. One of them always seem to be there... insuring quality service & food. Their Chips & Salsa ARE great. Their wings are huge & meaty. All employees were fantastic. A lot of TV's for sports too. Awesome / Casual hang out."}
{"text":"Great times ....  Great Drinks....  Great Food...  Seriously the tacos are great and you can never go wrong with the margaritas ....."}
{"text":"Wayyyyy better margs than Fuzzys and tacos are delicious. Love the mahi mahi taco and love the pork taco!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for over 10 minutes waiting for service while the two muscule head bar tenders flirted with the girls. They need a manager who actually cares about customer service.  No one even acknowledged I was there.  After waiting more that 10 minutes I left.   Then there was a bunch of homeless out front bothering people.    I will NEVER go back !"}
{"text":"If you describe any restaurant as a dumpster fire. This would be it. Great location to people watch. But the service is garbage. If this place is open in a year I'd be shocked.   ?"}
{"text":"The food is always wonderful. Whenever we have visitors, Loco is the number one restaurant requested by our guest.  Our 3 year old has severe allergies. We made a mistake by not realizing that the french fries were breaded(a likely allergen) until after our son had eaten several of them. Our server, Rachel was very concerned about our situation and asked the cook for an ingredient list on the french fries.  The cook went over and above getting the ingredient list.  Fortunately none of our son's allergens were on the list. We are just so thankful for the kindness that the server and cook showed us."}
{"text":"You must try the spicy margarita. Love it. The mahi mahi tacos are also excellent. Great location and great staff. The only reason I didn't rate a 5 is because they charge $6.00 for chips and salsa. I'm not a fan of flour tortillas in a Mexican restaurant,  so I think the chips/salsa needs serious work. We've been back 4 times, so I think we have tried several menu items. The pizza was excellent also."}
{"text":"Came with a party of 8 to watch a baseball game. Food was alright, vibe was good, but when it came time to checkout we waited for over 45 minutes. I have never experienced anything like it. We weren't given an explanation and were left to sit haplessly waiting. Eventually a manager came out and said the machine was broken, at which point We should have asked for our cards back and left without paying. I won't be back and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating, good food and friendly staff. Mahi soft taco was great and shrimp tostada bites were good. House marg was just okay."}
{"text":"Always friendly and fast service. Food is not bad, I always order a tostada. Best place to go in the Foothills. Atmosphere is always great."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would.  The service here is horrible, horrible, horrible! The BF and I went in on a Saturday evening around 6:00 and we each ordered a drink. The BF finished his and wanted another. The guys behind he bar just kept walking by and ignoring us. Then we get the attention of who we thought was a bartender.  When we said excuse me, he screamed (no really, he did) that he was just the bar back. The BF asked how are we supposed to know that, and the bar back continued to harass and yell at us.  When the bartender came over, we explained how rude the bar back was and he totally tried to justify the bar back's attitude.  So, we asked them to close out the tab and the bartender charged it to my credit card even though I wanted to pay cash which I told them that when I opened my tab .  The tab was $12.02 and I left $0 (first time I've ever done this) in tip seeing as how rude these idiots were.  Well, guess what?  When I got my credit card statement they added $3 for tip! So not only are they rude idiots but thieves as well.  Nice.  Well, I'll get the $3 back as I've disputed the $3 additional charge with the credit card company but for sure it will cost Loco Patron a lot more than $3 in lost revenue.  Not only will we never return but we will warn everyone we know, to stay away.  Way to go Loco Patron!!!!"}
{"text":"We were excited to visit this restaurant on Northsight since it is very near to our home.   Alas, we are now very disappointed in the overall experience.   The menu isn't the same as their other locations.   Our bill for 2 tacos ala carte, 2 tacos with the two sides, two house margaritas  (seemed a little weak) and chips and salsa was over $50.   We were charged $4.95 for chips and salsa and an extra $3.95 for extra salsa.   The other  locations give a bowl of chips and salsa for free so we asked why the large charge and the waitress stated that we were in \"North Scottsdale\".    REALLY???!!!!      The food was okay, but not worth the cost.    Really wanted to like this restaurant but at this point, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night, they're small patio was half full but the indoor seating was completely empty aside for us and one other table. First off we weren't greeted for at least five minutes and we were never brought menus- so just ended up filling out the taco cards they have. Took ten more minutes for her to bring us water *without* the lemon we asked for. Food came out fast and was pretty good except she gave my friend one less taco than she had asked for. Server never came back once the food was dropped, had to flag down a different server to refill our waters. Our server dropped our checks and took 10 more minutes to come back and cash us out. Was really disappointing service, we're all servers too. Maybe because we're relatively young she wasn't taking us seriously as guests. Won't be back."}
{"text":"2 shrimp tacos &  2 grilled mahi tacos on flour tortillas, twice a week for the last two or three years.  There's something to be said for finding a menu item that will keep you coming back for the long haul.  Well, how about two?"}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try a restaurant on Scottsdale road with an nice outdoor environment. I am not from Arizona but my fiance lived in Tempe years ago. Anyways we came across Loco Patron and decided that was a good option for a restaurant. I will say this, the place itself is not bad. Its the service that was so disappointing. I can understand a server not knowing much about the menu. In fact that would be perfectly acceptable. What is not acceptable is a server that seems bothered to be asked simple questions from someone who has never been there and needs a little help making a selection. I tried asking on 3 different occasions and each time i got a very short, annoyed response. Needless to say, I ended up picking something that I didnt really care for because i felt rushed and uncomfortable asking more questions. Her input and genuine willingness to help would have been greatly appreciated considering it was our first time there. I never write reviews on anything but Its a shame that what should have been a good experience turned out to be such a dissapointment."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Margaritas didn't suck. It's a solid 4+ star place.  Giving a 5 because its sitting at 3."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the Mill Avenue location due to working near there.  I always enjoyed the food and the service at that location was top notch (Thanks Jazz).  Upon taking a new job up in north Scottsdale, I was looking forward to trying out the newest location.  Finally found a lunch hour that worked, but unfortunately I had a disappointing experience and may not be back.  I got there at around 12:20 and promptly found a seat at the bar.  There was a decent crowd, but certainly not full.  It took a solid five minutes to be even acknowledged and ask for a drink.  I got my drink and a menu quickly, but then it took another 15 minutes before being checked on again in order to place a food order.  I was about to give up, but was really looking forward to some crunchy pork tacos that I got hooked on from going to the Tempe location.  After ordering, the food did not take long, but sadly these \"Award Winning\" tacos were not the same.  Not to say that they were bad, but they were prepared differently than they are at the other locations and just were not as tasty and satisfying.  I needed a drink refill halfway through my entree, but was not checked on again until I was finished eating.  The crunchy pork tacos were okay, but not nearly as good as the other 2 locations (the pinto bean side with the bacon was sadly the best part of the meal) and no free chips and salsa??  I understand this is north Scottsdale, but come on.  Service was lacking and will make me think twice about going back again...too bad."}
{"text":"Not at all good. Confusing for the first timer. No hostess, and no sign saying seat yourself. The girl servers were indistinguishable,  except for the low cut shirt, or booty shorts. The food was decent, but we spent the entire meal swatting at flies. I counted nearly 29 flies in the restaurant.  Felt like we were dining in a barn! The windows were open, so the smokers  smoke drifted into the restaurant,  and made the dinner even less enjoyable. The menu states winner of best taco at the taco festival,  but when I asked which taco it was the server did not even know! I don't recommend spending the time or money."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and here's my take - Great Service, but the food is best eaten when drunk because it's meh, and still at Scottsdale downtown prices.  All in all, for food I'd rather go to Chuy's at 32nd St &Thomas Rd seven days a week instead.  However...it did look like a fun place to hang out on a Friday night so I might be back for  a beer in the future!"}
{"text":"I know five stars seems crazy, but my boyfriend will tell you, I'm obsessed with this place. The waitstaff are friendly, caring, prompt, and efficient. I try to come here every Taco Tuesday, and have been like that for the past two years. There's a Loco in Tukee that I used to go to, but they charge more for drinks and the tacos are never as full. I'm always amazed by how well the staff handles the Taco Tuesdays, where I expect they are extra busy but always get my order out quickly and never seem stressed or rude. Whenever I'm having a dinner with friends or family from out of town, I come here. If it's a Tuesday, I can tacos for $1 and feel full, and a $4 margarita. I come on normal days too because i can always expect the food to be consistent, but I'm a bargain eater at heart.   Just remember that tacos are normally more expensive, so when you tip, tip off of the normal price, not the Tuesday bargain. Especially if you come back often like me.   My only real complaint is the DJs are often too loud. I get trying to make it more of a party place to compete with the other places on Mill.... but if it's too loud I feel rushed and can't talk to my friends! But if you come early enough, there's no DJ anyways, haha."}
{"text":"Buyer beware! Let's just say they get an A+ in Customer Disservice!! I will not be going back, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow the grilled shrip taco's are incredible, atmostphere is fun - our bartender, Tim was friendly. Highly recogmend this place"}
{"text":"I'm not sure which I'm more impressed with, the margarita or the staff! I highly recommend if you're in town, you must try a margarita here. The location is great for people watching and judging. The chips and salsa are some of the best I've had... And I live in LA. That's saying a lot! Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"I love loco patron!! They have the best tacos and the margaritas are delicious. My friends and I come here often, whether it is for an hour or two, or just to stop in and grab a drink. The wait staff is so friendly and attentive which makes the bar area more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I love sitting at the bar. The coconut shrimp tacos are yummy with the Spanish rice and potatoes. Friendly atmosphere, a great place to meet people. Although I was not drinking, the bartender was awesome. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Just called out the bartender with watered down bottles. They substitute generic brands. We ordered Tuacca which is a darker liquor, instead we got a light version of butterscotch. The bartender knew exactly what Loco Patron practices are because he didn't refute our claims. Unbelievable"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays at Loco are AMAZING!!!! The have such an assortment of tacos for such a great price. Not to mention the margaritas! Excited to go back tomorrow. Hopefully Kera will be working! I highly recommend this establishment to everybody!"}
{"text":"First time for me but not my husband. He's been talking about these tacos you guys make. There's very few places in Scottsdale that have Real authentic tacos & let's just say I know good tacos!  Took some friends there this past weekend and OMG the tacos are amazing & their Green Yea Shots .... I'm hooked! Service was ok but it was crazy busy so I can't hold that against them . I will definitely go back and will recommend this place to all my friends & family!"}
{"text":"Great local watering hole for a younger croud in the north Scottsdale area, decent food too!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre all around; never received chips and salsa, ordered combo fajitas which were fair but the steak portion was very overcooked to the point it would not break loose upon biting. Waitress seemed pissed off when I only wanted water to drink and not alcohol. Only reason it's 2 stars and not 1 is the framed O.J. jersey on the wall with the guilty sign stuck to the glass enclosure."}
{"text":"There wasn't much to like about this place except the location is  RIGHT AT the light rail. The music was annoying (live \"bad\" band), the drinks expensive and sour. I like a margarita served in glass, not plastic. I felt like I should have been poolside or at a sporting event. Didn't try the food and won't be back to see what that's about."}
{"text":"This place blows and seems to be busy on overflow from the surrounding restaurants.  The food is not very good, service is slow and the place is dirty. I think it more of bar than restaurant.  Rap music blaring at 7:00 pm.  Even night clubs wait until 9:00 to go solid rap at ear piercing levels.   I'm surprised they are still in business when there are so many choices in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I really think these are the best Taco Tuesday choices in Scottsdale.   Quality food , great choices of tacos to choose from, fast and friendly service.  Great atmosphere and plenty of drink choices.  The place is busy but got four tacos out fast. They were very filling and super tasty.  Guy"}
{"text":"just go - sit outside & people watch. Had home made sangria = phagetaboutit had naked taco = oooooooffa had shrimp taco = gimme anudder chips n salza - dats right wit a Z     really good.  dis iz da place to go."}
{"text":"Shrimp grilled tacos were awesome! And the skinny margaritas with wild berry was yummy.  I would have given it 5 stars but our waitress was pretty much useless. How do you come to a table, after being waved down, and not ask everyone if they need another drink. Specially when the glass is empty. Then we had to stop her again before she took off because two others needed a drink. Then she brings the drink back, sets it at the edge of the table and doesn't even take the empty. Had to ask for more chips, than our check, didn't see if it was separate checks even tho the second half of our party came later. We pretty much stumped her with \"put 50 on the blue card and the rest on the other\". Maybe she should go home, since we seemed to be bothering her."}
{"text":"Dude -- awesome margaritas and Chips n Salsa!  We've been here a few times in our quest to find \"the best\" margarita and chips/salsa place. Last time we went it was a Sunday afternoon.  The crowd looked like they had been out drinking the night before and needed some mexican food to make their heads feel better.    Love this place -- I'd like one near my house too!!  Peace Out"}
{"text":"I want to give this place two stars. It deserves two stars, HOWEVER, I have decided on 3 for the sheer fact of the sale of cheap tacos and cheap beer.   I will be first to say that I strongly dislike the semi-douchey scene of Loco Patron, but what can one expect when they're in an OTSCO bar that is frequented by barely legal drinkers? So I set my thirty year old snobbery aside and went for some cheap tacos. When I walked in to what I thought was a restaurant, I was carded! WTF? There was a 7 year old kid munching on his taco, watching my carding go down. We locked eyes for a moment while the bouncer flashed his light on my ID, I think the child was mocking me. I was wondering why he was allowed in. Oh well.   After that puzzling moment, I met the gang. While the conversation at the table was rousing, I couldn't help but notice the coke-ho dancing without any rhythm or to the music that was in her head at the bar in front of us. She was really working it too! I tore my eyes away from the train wreck to peruse the simple menu. I ordered off of the regular menu to get some shrimp tacos. They were pretty flavorful! I was rather surprised. I also ordered a steak taco off of the \"Taco Tuesday\" menu to try. Again, another pretty good, flavorful taco! The rice and beans were just alright. Nothing too amazing.   I guess my overall impression is that Loco Patron is a great place to meet some friends if you're broke on a Tuesday and you're hungry and want a beer or two! I wouldn't rush back to visit this joint, but it would do in a pinch."}
{"text":"If there were negative stars for this place, that would be my choice. This \"restaurant\" is by far one of the most foul-smelling, looking and run down places I have ever seen.  I didn't even want to eat my food off the plate. This is NOT Mexican food. It's a joke. I ordered \"tacos\" and I had a hair that was about 12 inches long that I had to pull out of my mouth like a magician, pulling out that rainbow paper from their throat.  To me, this place reminds me of the part in the Movie Accepted.  Jonah Hill walks into this gross, grungy, beat down, run down nasty-looking building:  \"This place is awesome because now I can  finally get hepatitis.\" \"I hope you have hobo stab insurance.\" \"Great! The birthplace of crack!\" \"I don't wanna be here when the walls start to bleed\" I wish I could paint you guys a better picture of the establishment... But this is the best I got!"}
{"text":"Glad this restaurant bar is back in business. Great experience and great happy hour. The arrival experience, James met us at the door and was  extremely welcoming, to Ryan our server, who rocked our entire experience. Great value for the excellent Margaritas and food. Awesome vibe on the patio. Welcome to the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"I would absolutely agree with the past string of reviews, one or two stars max. The bar has that smelly rotten odor that begs to be scrubbed and cleaned. My Taco Tuesday order was disappointing and were slapped together. They did not at all fit the menu description and dripped with grease. How does something like this even make it past the kitchen and to the customer?  Frankly, the place is just not very good."}
{"text":"After a 12 hour drive, we got into town around 7pm on a Saturday night and checked into our hotel.  We were tired and needed a shower, but we were also starving and in need of cold refreshments.  We headed into Old Town and went by at least 10 places that had long waits, had nobody seated (which is always a bad sign on a Saturday night), or looked like they were a little more upscale than sweaty t-shirt and shorts attire.  By now it was around 8 o'clock and we decided to take a chance on Loco.  They were slammed, too, but we found a booth in the corner and took a seat.  Let me be the first to tell you that we were not expecting much - chain restaurant, young crowd which usually means the beer is cheap and the food is edible \"enough\" (hey, I was a college kid not too long ago and things haven't changed), and terrible service if you're not a local or someone they know.  We. were. totally. surprised.  And, in a good way.  Our server, Emilee, greeted us quickly and took our drink order and one of the other servers brought us chips and salsa.  Emilee came back a short while later and told us that our beers would be coming and she took our order - their \"award winning\" pork tacos with refried beans and a side salad, and two different enchiladas with the same sides.  Our beers arrived soon as did our salads.  The good-sized salads were extremely fresh with lots of different veggies.  Wow, we thought as we wolfed them down.  The rest of the meal was served right when we were finishing the salads and I have to say that everything was good.  Including the beans, which is usually the worst part of the meal at most Mexican restaurants.  Good food, good service despite the crowd, quick kitchen.  We left sated and with smiles on our faces.  Pretty damn impressed, too."}
{"text":"My husband and I occasionally go to loco patron, it is nearby our home .  With limited venues in the area we tend to return to this establishment.  It is a hit or miss experience.  The food is ok.  Sometimes the waitress is on top of her job and provides good service.  Usually it is on Sundays where service is lacking. The last Sunday we went there was only on waitress.  It took some time to get our food and drinks.  The waitress forgot several things we asked for.  We ended up leaving our left overs because she forgot to bring a container not once but twice.  The restaurant manager sat at the end of the bar drinking alcohol and eating as he is visiting with his group of friends.  He would come and go from the building (jumping in a brand new corvette driving off).  and not even show any leadership or giving a concern for the customers."}
{"text":"We found this spot after traveling all day and we were starving. It did not disappoint. The crunchy fish tacos were the bomb!! The salsa was so delicious. I think we went thru 4 bowls. My husband's chimmechanga (sp?) was ok. But I generally don't like that dish. Only complaint is the drinks lacked much alcohol. We went during happy hour. So that maybe why they weren't the best. The service was also on point. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It was fun and lively for a Thursday night. Very scottsdale-ish... Tight dresses, tons of makeup and guys in affliction shirts...eww.  It was a mix of cougar and cougarettes, young and old...i mean mature:)  Casual and Dressy attire everywhere..  The bar was having a special on imported beer, and a guy bought a round of drinks for everyone there..so that is a plus for being in Scottsdale I guess.   I'll try to go back sometime and try the food..."}
{"text":"This food is so good! The salsa is addicting. Our service is why I didn't rate this higher. It's our first time here and they have our food to the table behind us. They then forgot to make my margarita. You'd think they'd offer something but nope! The service is also very slow!"}
{"text":"Tried for lunch... Friday, half empty and told me food would be 20 minutes after ordered.  20 minutes later... another 20 minutes for a half empty restraunt."}
{"text":"My parents live around the corner from here and it's a pretty regular stop for me when I'm up visiting them.   I've gotten a few things on the menu and have enjoyed all of them. However my absolute favorite is the Grilled (not fried) Fish Tacos. They have the perfect amount of fish with delicious pickled cabbage and green sauce. With a corn tortilla it's perfect!! I have to admit I have not found better anywhere in Tucson...though I'm looking!  One major criticism is that their classic margarita is awful. Way to sweet.  This would normally be a big problem but the tacos are so good that it only takes away one star in my book.  I've only gone for lunch but service has always been great! Their takeout is also wonderful. Just as good as in house!!"}
{"text":"We came here based on a recommendation from the person at our hotel. The tacos were really good. We had the lobster and the shrimp. The chips were so salty, I could not eat them. Margaritas were mediocre. Would not come back here."}
{"text":"Stopped in here last week to try out their taco Tuesday specials. It was packed and I could tell the staff was a little overwhelmed, but that didn't stop them from providing excellent service! My bartenders name was Brandi with an I, she was fun and had great energy with a smile to match. I will definitely be returning for Brandi's awesome service with a smile"}
{"text":"Loco Patron should be renamed Bebido (Drunk) Patron (Boss). This place needs a \"BAR RESCUE\" we left after the self admitted owner stated he was drunk and wanted to get F'ed up doing shots with patrons. The customer service is terrible at best, the cook likes to wipe his hands on his pants as he prepares food while not wearing gloves, the chips are stale, the beer is room temp. I was absolutely convinced we were on a episode of \"Bar Rescue\" and the cameras were going to come out and shut this place down! No luck, as my stomach started to gurgle after eating the chips and salsa I had to race home to sit on the porcelain throne! You got me good Loco Patron!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, a lot of TVs, good food. Fun place to stop and get a drink. They have some great drinks. Big Servings. Really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Weekday..not busy.  Slow service, chips had little flavor as did shrimp fajitas.  Salsa is ice cold pureed mush Will not be back."}
{"text":"Went there several weeks back and had an terrible experience that still hasn't been resolved. When we showed up there was confusion with the hostess (several people were there but none greeted us). Once we finally got their attention after asking to be seated it didn't get any better. We asked for water and they brought out three glasses for our table of six. Twice throughout dinner I asked for a glass and they still never brought one out. My fiancee didn't receive the correct order either. The only saving grace was that the food was very good despite the terrible service. I'd love to give the benefit of a doubt but the restaurant wasn't even busy. It was honestly one of the worst examples of service I've ever received. To add insult to injury they incorrectly charged me $13 for a beer. I've call the restaurant six times now and it still hasn't been resolved. I was waiting for it to get corrected before writing the review but it's apparent that they aren't going to take care of it. If you're considering going here I would suggest another restaurant - there's plenty of other options where the staff actually cares about their patrons."}
{"text":"Quick lunch trip. It's right next to the light rail station on Mill ave so it's easily accessible if you're anywhere on campus or in the Tempe area. A few seconds after I sat myself, my server brought chips and fresh salsa to the table. I had the Chicken Tortilla Soup and it was comforting and delicious. There were diced avocados in it! I'm only giving 4 stars because there were little birds hopping around inside the restaurant. I feel extremely uncomfortable around birds so I was on edge each second."}
{"text":"Tried this spot for lunch and it was OK, food was average but overall pretty good. I ordered two tacos with rice/beans which was very standard, but yes, tasty! Our service was pretty good, staff was nice. The overall ambiance of the place was fun, especially for a warm day. The prices were pretty high for what you are receiving imo."}
{"text":"Only place in the area open past 10pm..  good food andgood prices.  went on a Tuesday night and they have a lot of specials making the bill even cheaper!!  will definitely stop there next time in town"}
{"text":"Loco Patron is great for what it is - a place to get drunk for cheap, and snack on what I like to call \"bar Mexican food\". There are a handful of places in very close proximity to Loco that also offer similarly priced \"bar Mexican food\", but I choose Loco every time over Salty's or Dos or San Felipe's.   I have drank here many times, eaten here many times, and overall I generally really like this bar. They've got a nice smoking patio with effective misters -- seriously where else do you see people on the patio in 110+ degree Arizona heat in summer besides Loco?  They've got a pretty good happy hour that goes until 7pm, offering lots of discounts on drinks. I'm pretty sure some or most of their appetizers are discounted during HH too, which is a plus for me.   The mahi mahi tacos are probably my favorite menu item. For $13 you get two pretty decent sized tacos on your choice of corn or flour tortillas filled with delicious grilled mahi mahi, pico, an avocado cream sauce, and caramelized onions. Yum. Oh, and your choice of two sides, but who gets anything besides rice and beans at a place like this anyway?  My least favorite thing about this bar is hands down their salsa. In my opinion, it doesn't have enough spice/kick to it, and tastes and looks very watered down. But they do offer several flavors of Cholula and Tobasco, so all is not lost ;-)"}
{"text":"If Loco Patron was located on a beach in Mexico it would probably be an amazing hangout after a long day of sand and beer but alas it's not....the patio is great when the weather is nice, bar is okay at best, drinks are good and staff is generally uninterested in you. You can tell a lot of the clientele are regulars (which is great) large amount of college guys and men still thinking they are college guys.  Had the chicken quesadilla ( it wasn't that great) how you ruin a quesadilla I'm not sure, chips tasted older and salsa was runny.  Friends had the wings they were good! Decor looks like a beachside bar in Rocky Point, cleanliness?? Look it's a dive type bar/restaurant I don't think they are trying to be anything other than that, could it have been dusted? Sure, chip or two or ten on the floor of course! Definitely not my favorite place but with sports on the TV, a good bar and a ton of ASU fans.....I'll live!"}
{"text":"We walked up & sat at the bar on a busy Saturday evening. The weather was perf so we sat at the outside bar. We were greeted by staff quickly & poured a good tequila concoction. The prices weren't happy hour so they were on par for the area especially on a Sat night. I'm too picky on the Mexican food so I have never ventured past a salsa for fear of disappointment. Again not because of them or their food just me. That is all."}
{"text":"right on the pulse of old town night life( scottsdale rd/ 5th ave) a great place to start the night with great food and a better place to end the night( best margarita i've had ) Ask for JJ to make you one you'll be hooked, and make sure to get a plate of fried ice cream ,yeah i duno how its done but its good."}
{"text":"By far the best bar food in Old Town! The wings are the bomb, even better than Zipps in my opinion and I LOVE Zipps wings, and the tacos are unreal. They also have a full menu and I would highly recommend the Carne Asada. It's like $15 and comes with a bunch of sides and all of the fixings in case you want to make tacos. I normally just eat it like steak with sides but I have used everything you get to make tacos and it's the bomb!   On top of the great food the drinks are good, I mean drinks are drinks anywhere but they have good prices and they are not weak.   The service here is what really sets it apart from the rest of the bars in Old Town. I used to visit this bar on occasion when I lived in L.A. like 6-7 years ago and they still have a ton of the same people. It's great and they are so friendly.   If anywhere in Old Town deserves 5 stars it is Loco Patron! -AJD"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Thursday night.  It didn't seem to be too busy, all the tables near the bar were open except one, and the waitresses were chatting with each other near the patio.   Entering alone, I would normally sit at the bar for my drinks and maybe a little food.  They were all taken, (and I found out quickly it was for good reason) so I positioned myself near the televisions so I could watch the game.    Menus were on each table so I glanced through them while waiting.  The third quarter of the Colts- Titans game had just started when I sat down.  I decided to leave once the Titan's had scored about four minutes of game time later(which probably means I had been sitting there for 10 minutes).  The waitresses gave me the once over when I walked in and then not a look after that.    I guess they don't need business that badly."}
{"text":"The waitress was super nice. She took her time to take a great picture also helped with picking a drink on yelp. I got a mango margarita  (not the habnerno one). It was slushy type. It was do delicious."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last few years for everything from to live music on Friday nights to Sunday football and food. The kitchen staff is always on point with the food, bartenders make great drinks, and everyone is always very welcoming. It's a perfect place to hang with friends, watch sports, eat, and drink. They just revamped their brunch menu and phenomenal. For being a Mexican place the wings are amazing as well, try the salt, pepper, and jalapeño ones. They are AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"In an area better know for Blue Hairs, this place is alive and kicking.  The decor is vibrant and the food is standard Gringo Mexican.  Think fish tacos and burritos and tostadas.  Pretty simple, not so cheap food.  I myself went veggie: the red sauce on the enchiladas had the right kick of chili: the cheese gooey, and the bean tostada was perfect. The wait staff was attentive."}
{"text":"Some bars treat their food menu as an afterthought. That isn't the case at Loco Patron. Fajitas, quesadillas, salt and pepper wings...all very nice. Perhaps my favorite meal at Loco is brunch, though. I love their divorced eggs with enchilada sauce. It pairs well with their habanero bloody Marys.  Drinks are reasonably priced and service is outstanding. I hosted a pretty large group at Loco Patron on a football saturday. The restaurant was very busy, but we still had outstanding service. No one in my party had an empty drink in his/her hand for very long, which is quite impressive given the crowd and the propensity for my friends to consumer alcohol. Long after that event, I'm still having people say what a great time they had at Loco.  In short, my favorite place on Mill."}
{"text":"While on my vacation in Scottsdale this place was super convenient on many counts. It was a scorching 100 degree day and I of course needed a cold bevvy to help cool me down. This place is super cute, a lot of outdoor seating - under the ingenious water misters, so that was a plus.. I love those things, casual ambiance, walk up window to the bar from the outside is great! I only grabbed a couple drinks both times i ended up here, but the service was great, friendly and fast.   Unfortunately my first beer tasted like it was from the bottom of the keg and completely flat, but honestly i was on vacation in the sun, drinking a beer - on a week day. Can't complain too much!! I will definitely be going back, especially to try the yummy tacos i saw my neighbor chowing down on."}
{"text":"So I only went here because it was 10 on a Sunday night, and I guess all mexican restaurants in the area close before then. So this was the last option.  And I was REALLY surprised. The manager offered us free drinks, I had the best tostada in town, and the chips and salsa were really good too.  Overall, we paid 10 bucks for a great meal.  By the way, if you like people-watching, this place is a must-go. My boyfriend and I were entertained the entire time!"}
{"text":"Food is OK, people watching is great, drinks are good I've been to this place a few times, only when i was in Scottsdale on business. This place has good drinks and is great for people watching. Some real lookers come into this place for happy hour. Just a good place to hang out. Food is alright, more of a nightlife place. Saint Patricks day was pretty fun here in 2006."}
{"text":"This place is know for there margaritas. I have had margaritas here on a couple of occasions. The food is very average though, nothing to write home about. I find the margaritas here to be good yet they are pricey. Expect to pay upwards of $10-15 dollars depending on the type that you order."}
{"text":"A friend works here so I could definitely be a bit biased. As a regular, however, this place easily has some the best food in the east valley. I have tried a number of things on the menu. My favorites include the Coconut Shrimp Taco, Mexican Street Cart Taco, Crunchy Fish Taco, Salt and Pepper Wings, Carne Asada Fries, and of course the Nachos Con Queso Blanco (Extra Avocado. Jalapeños on the side). They have Taco Tuesday specials. I'm not a big fan of burritos or their enchiladas but I know what I like whenever I do come there. The service is also quick and great. Although that might be because I'm a regular."}
{"text":"One star because the food was actually good when we got it, unfortunately the service was so god awful I will never return. Were they busy? Absolutely. However I have never had such bad service. When we first sat down a couple different waitresses came up to our table, they couldn't figure out who was going to have our table. Once this was settled we got chips and guac which came pretty quickly however nobody came back to the table until we were good and done with the appetizer. We finally order dinner, 20-25 mins goes by and the waitress comes by to see if we needed anything else, she didn't even realize we hadn't gotten our food and was gone so quickly we couldn't tell her. 40-45 mins has gone by and she finally comes back to see if we were ready for the check to which we laughed and said we had yet to get our food. The waitress blames the kitchen takes our order again (taco salad and 2 tacos with rice and beans) and finally 10 mins later we get our food. But wait, the tacos are not anything close to what my friend had ordered. The waitress comped our dinners but still handed us a bill for the guac and one margarita. It seems nobody in that restaurant knows what they are doing, and I sadly will never go back. Don't waste your time with the God awful service."}
{"text":"Tacos were decent at best, service was ridiculously slow, and my $11 blackberry margarita was *literally* all ice. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The best shrimp ceviche! I have tried to find comparable all over the U.S. and just can't find it. We love coming back to Scottsdale...and this is always our first stop. The staff is always friendly, personable and knowledgeable about their menu. This time, we sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the bartenders at work. Good stuff going on here!"}
{"text":"No gluten free menu and the margaritas are a big lie.  They claim to do fresh squeezed.  What a joke?!  Chips and salsa is not free and not worth a penny either!  Rice is not good either!"}
{"text":"Great food with awesome service. Finally a  place with a great patio right in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Service was great at this location. I was thirsty and I really wanted a water quickly. The server Kevin did a great job refilling my glass and bringing us a flask of water.   Now for the food, I had the taco plate with the fish tacos and a side of beans and rice. The beans and rice were delicious. The tacos on the other hand had way too much pick and sauce. I couldn't finish them because the sauce overpowered the taste of the taste of the fish. Service was great but food did leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Had a great time here yesterday!  We've been several times, but we came to keep the brunch party rolling and celebrate my besties bday!  It did not disappoint.  We had margaritas and shots of tequila and kept the party alive!  While I didn't think the margaritas (house) were much to write home about, the staff was friendly and attentive, and the vibe of the bar was so fun!  We played ping pong and even ran through the fountains a few times (probably for kids but we can be big kids too!) and, of course, took our picture in the cactus cutout!  Definitely a great spot for fun w friends!!"}
{"text":"Started off terrible. No one helped us for 30 minutes. Yes, it was National Championship night, but still. Asked for the manager. He came out... very sincere and took care of us. Great service from than on. Been here 20 times. Always great food and great people. People make mistakes, Or places get busy. It's all about the attitude to correct the problem for me. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Worst service ever experienced in the Tuke.  Food decent if you ever get the server to put it in.  Ordered 2 coors lites no less than 4 times with 4 different servers- all no shows.  Horrible service - no organization. First and last time!  Waitress admitted she was new and it was bad experience- come on mgt get it together!"}
{"text":"Loco Patron is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Great staff, better food, and even better drinks! I will definitely be back again soon :)"}
{"text":"Not too impressed. Our server was kind of ignoring us while she paid attention to bigger tables. One server just took my brothers plate and didn't ask if he was finished. Plus, with charging $1 for each basket of chips (1st one free) you'd think it would be a bigger basket with better salsa.  Also our server would rush by and we would have to try to waive her down to order more. Only a few times she asked if we wanted another drink or more water.  Felt very negleted. I understand it's St paddy's day, but on that kind of a holiday, you would stress customer service and over staff  Especially with an all day concert up the road."}
{"text":"Yo yo yo friends if your ever out in Tempe try  the loco patron Mexican grill ! Great atmosphere , great happy hour and great tasting food . The day to go is Taco Tuesday , go early because it's slammed with  hopping 1.50 Taco specials . If it's a beautiful sit outside,  so grab your buds, your BFF and have a good time ! As always if you go let me know what you think . Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great food! Amazing drinks! The patio is perfect for the warm weather and very dog friendly. Great spot with a fun ambiance. Highly recommend their carne asada waffle fries and spicy cilantro mule. My girlfriend had the spicy margarita with codigo and she loved it. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"So here we are on new years eve. I'm the designated driver. No coffee is served in the establishment.  None. Nada. I haven't been drinking. I don't drink alcohol but I was looking forward to enjoying a cup of coffee with dinner which I usually do at other places. Nope. All they serve is soft drinks and alcohol. Too bad. All I can give is 2 stars. And on new years eve when you should encourage a designated driver"}
{"text":"Heading out here with a couple buddies for Taco Tuesday night, not extremely easy to find out what the apecials are... use the paper and pencils for Taco specials...beer specials are at the bar"}
{"text":"So lame. They don't have the decency to let people know on their restaurant.com ad that they no longer accept certificates, so we drove all the way there for nothing. We LOVE Mexican food, but this place lost present and future business from us. Shame on you Loco Patron."}
{"text":"Definitely a local spot. I have friends who live nearby so we went for a quick dinner. It's a New York-themed sports bar with the focus of football teams in the following order: 1. Buffalo Bills 2. Giants 3. Jets. So know that before you go watch the game.   It was packed when we went there on a sunday night. They have some good outdoor seating/open air seating.  I just got a beer and a quesadilla and they were both decent but nothing special.  My problem with the place was the service. It was a little too lax. We had essentially 3 waiters coming by asking us the same questions but then not getting us the food or drinks. My friend ordered a wine and got it just before we were about to leave. Not a bad spot to watch the game as grab a beer but it's not a dining destination."}
{"text":"I recently had an orgasmic meal at loco patron. The waitress Christine was very helpful as we came in near close and served us with a great attitude! The food was amazing! Going to recommend this to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Seemed pretty dirty.  Didnt eat here just had some drinks.  Nasty bathroom - wouldnt go back"}
{"text":"Great Taco Tuesday!!  Love the $2 crunchy fish tacos!! Sometimes hard to get a seat outside and the inside just isn't the same :)"}
{"text":"This place has definitely been my go to for food and drinks. The naked street tacos are the best I've had. If your not feeling tacos, the poblano enchiladas are killer! and the salt and pepper wings are seriously better than anyone else's. If your looking for great drinks and service, Brandi will definitely ensure you a great time. Go loco, keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"So I've been wanting to try Loco Patron for quite some time since Salty Sinorita's, Los Olivos, and Frank and Lupe's absolutely stink!!! We went in and were ignored .....almost left but thought we'd get a beer at the bar and be on our way. The beer was Ice COLD!! We were spotted and helped. We got the shredded beef and shredded pork tacos, 2 soft corn and 2 crunchy. Out of this world!!! Will I be back?? You betcha, plus tell my friends and family from out of state when they come to visit."}
{"text":"I love loco. I come here two to three times a week, but this weekend? We decide to come here for the playoffs only to discover a completely different menu - one that is missing half to three quarters of their normal fare - and is about $2 more expensive per item.   Now, I understand that places want to take advantage of the business and the extra people in town. But what about having specials instead of price gauging? Even being a regular, I'm not sure I'm going to want to continue to support a business that wants to charge locals more to visit on a weekend that we happen to have a lot of visitors in town. What is next? Price gauging for the entire month of March for spring training?"}
{"text":"Refused to let a group of at least 15 patrons in for pub crawl because the first guy asked for a high five (which was part of the crawl) and claimed he was too intoxicated. When some females from the group asked to use the restroom while the rest of the group waited outside again the bouncer refused entry. We were neither rude nor \"too intoxicated.\" There were only about 8 people in the bar so you would think he would let a big group in and leave it up to the bartender to serve or not serve. He was also rude asking for every drink each person had consumed that evening while invading personal space. Never returning. Ever. Also while checking IDs, he was on the phone with his girlfriend. If you're gonna be a dick while you do your job at lest give it your full attention."}
{"text":"We asked the bartender for a tequila reference and provided one of the best and smooth tasting I've had.  Then we got into a discussion regarding chicken wings  and the manager provided a complimentary order of wings are you kidding me......wow what above and beyond service.  Well done this type of service is rare and above/beyond what is typical.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Best margarita ever! I'm very picky and these rock the house! You can tell they only use quality ingredients! Everything at this place is that way. The salsa is made fresh to order and is so good. The chips are nice and thin, warm, just perfect. Best crunchy fish taco too...service is always awesome. I come here every month while on travel for work and it's like a treat!! Wish happy hour was an hour longer!! Lol."}
{"text":"This place makes me miss ASU so bad.  Hanging out with a crowd last night who were at least a few years removed from college, it really drives home the fact that life is different now.  Anyway, on to the food/drinks/experience.  TACO TUESDAY is awesome.  $2 tacos, $2 beers.  Does it get any more simple and easy than that?  I really enjoyed the tacos, as well.  The atmosphere sucks unless you love the faux Mexican beach chic theme-restaurant thing they have going there.  I didn't love the music.  It was pretty deserted, which surprised me.  Seems to me such a terrific deal should really draw people in, but apparently that's not the case, or at least it wasn't last night around 8 or so.    I'll go back for the food whenever I get stuck missing ASU again."}
{"text":"Dear World,  You know the drill. It's lunch time. You are hungry. You don't know what you want or where you want it. You don't go to sites like google or yahoo. You go to Yelp. That's where the searches are taking place. Steve Jobs even said so in a video. I know because I saw the video.   Anyway, on this particular day, my former boss says, \"Dave, how do you feel about Loco Patron\". I said...\"works for me.\"   So the first paragraph of this review was completely meaningless.  In any case, we sat outside on the patio for lunch, and I ordered the steak salad. The steak was cooked to perfection, the dressing captured the true essence of all things salad, and the greens weren't wilted. They were crisp, fresh and delightful.  The service wasn't memorable, but it wasn't bad.   Love,  Me."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could.  I came here later in the evening in a Taco Tuesday after the rush had already died down and you could count the patrons on 2 hands.  I ordered 5 tacos- a bigger order but nothing crazy,  mo additional toppings, just standard.  After 20 minutes and trouble just getting a glass of water from the bartender, the barkeep told me she would check on my order.  She came back with no tacos, and no update, even.  Keep in mind she only went to check on my order after I brought up how a man got nachos sent out who sat down well after I did and clearly ordered after I did, as well.  That same man then got his fajitas before there was any food of mine up in the window(the place was so empty I could see the action, or lack thereof in the kitchen from the bar). Now, I've operated many a hospitality establishment and am very easy going and understanding but 30 minutes after I ordered I cancelled it, and at this time usually a manager would stop by because they'd have to be alerted that a ticket for 20 or so dollars was being cancelled.  There was no manager interaction, no real apology, even.  I was beyond appalled and pissed.  I love the location in old town Scottsdale and would expect more of the same here but everyone that was working seemed totally disinterested in treating the customer, or even themselves with any sort of care(the food runner looked beyond disheveled and I'm not sure if want my food delivered by them even if it did come out in time!) Overall, just a sorry excuse for an establishment."}
{"text":"Loco was awesome! My friends and I met and had an awesome bartender. I forgot her name but she was a shorter, pretty brunette, she was super nice! the nachos were bomb too"}
{"text":"The outdoor patio is awesome (weather permitting) and the service was good. Went there during happy hour and the food was horrible. I had the stuffed quesadilla with chicken and the brew pub trio (guac, salsa & cheese). The quesadilla is like a calzone- very doughy. The tortilla was not good at all and the chicken did not taste good at all. Very funky taste.   Of the brew pub trio, only the guac was halfway decent. The salsa was very bland and the cheese sauce had a weird smoky flavor.  Bottom line, go for the drinks & ambience. Skip the food."}
{"text":"Only Mexican restaurant I've ever been to where you have to PAY for extra salsa. .... Really????  Will not return, and Mexican food is my favorite."}
{"text":"Good food. The salsa was great. Had the carne asada tacos and they were decent. The tortillas were a little dry. Otherwise good had great flavor. Drinks were good. Service was a little slow but there was only one waitress. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite New Mexican restaurant in town! It is super inviting and is perfect for both lunch and dinner. Service is always fast and there is a range of food options for anyone! The \"naked\" tacos are perfect for anyone with a gluten issue and it was some of the best guacamole I've ever had. This deserves a better rating then it has rn."}
{"text":"The patio is nice.  The food and drinks are awful.  The skinny margarita was sweeter than any house margarita I've had.   The waitress asked us if we wanted chips and salsa.  Sure....the salsa tastes like a can of tomatoes.  I asked for different salsa.  Sure....we got charged $5.  The food was terrible.  The chicken was inedible and they claim it's award winning.  It was the worst meal I've had in years."}
{"text":"At first glance, loco patron seems to be a cool and trendy place where you would assume to get decent food. Now, I'm no critic but it sucked. Chips and salsa were garbage. There was one good thing about this place, the habanero salsa that they charge $1 for. The shredded pork had like a barbecue sweet nasty sauce on it, way too much fusion flavors mixed together improperly."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Loco to open for months. What a huge disappointment! From the server who wanted to be ANYWHERE but there to the weird pretzel bites to the tapas sized entree and a marg that had more ice than a glass should hold...I could go on and on.  I'm hoping the powers that be take their numerous 1 and 2 star reviews as a clue that some changes need to be made if they're going to survive. Good Luck!"}
{"text":"The place is awesome and has a great vibe and friendly staff. The bartender Heather recommended the poblano enchiladas and they were out of this world. They have a great beer selection and many TVs that they are willing to change to whatever you want to watch. High five to Loco Patron. Go cats!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and Margs! Check out taco Tuesday!!  Big plus THEY ALLOW DOGS:))) fun ambiance with a great outdoor area to enjoy your food"}
{"text":"My husband & I went to this place for lunch, our food was delicious, hubby had crunchy beef tacos with side of refried beans, the beans were so good. I had a soft shredded beef taco with side of Spanish rice, skinny prickly pear margarita, yum!!"}
{"text":"taco Tuesdays are awesome. You can typically find me there every week. Ambiance is loud and fun. TVs everywhere so if there is a game on you can watch. Servers are ALWAYS on top of their game (and typically very attractive). Great low key place in Old Town"}
{"text":"Visiting Arizona from San Diego. Stopped here before going to the zoo. Cute little town and excellent breakfast and great service."}
{"text":"It pains me to give this place 2 stars because I am in love with their tacos, the sauce they put on them is so delicious.  However, what kind of place with a full service menu starts carding at 5 pm everyday!?! I used to come for Taco Tuesday last year, when I was only 20, and have tacos. Sometimes they started carding kind of early (7 pm-ish) but normally they didn't start until around 8. Still a bit early but not outrageously so. I attempted to bring my friend for tacos last week. Even though I am now 21, she is not. We arrived around 6:30 pm, and were told that we could not enter the establishment because she wasn't 21. The bouncer told us they card at 5 pm everyday (earlier on Sundays) and  we could come back with a parent or guardian. UM, not only are we college students whose parents live out of state, even if they were nearby, what 20 year old would even bother doing that?! It's like being under 13 again and not being able to go to the public pool without your mommy or daddy....it's just ridiculous.  The logic of this policy baffles me...there were young children there with their parents eating dinner. I really just don't get the point of letting 10 year olds in with a parent but not someone who is 20...not like it was prime drinking hour!!  Carding at 8-9 makes sense when it started becoming more bar than restaurant, but if you are going to have a full service menu, it's just stupid.  Since Loco Patron apparently did not want our money, we went across Scottsdale Road to El Hefe and had delicious tacos and guacamole. :) They impressed me there, giving us the happy hour deal on tacos even though we arrived just after HH technically ended. Fabuloso!"}
{"text":"The service sucks. Waitress took over 10 minutes to come take our order. Two other servers came by, saw we were waiting n trying to order, but refused to take our order n said our server would be coming. Lame service right there . Waitress finally came , totally sour attitude. (We hadn't even complained ). She disappeared again. Had to flag her down just to get the check . On top of all that, the music was horrible. Bad rap and country n I don't even know what category music. All in all, def not coming back. On the up side, my margarita was strong so left w a buzz :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in to cool off on our way back to DTPHX via light rail from Tempe Town Lake. Saw they had summer shandy on tap, that was enough for me to pull up a seat. The bar looks good, and it probably gets quite busy on the weekends during the college season. $8.25 for a 25oz Shandy, not bad, but could get that at BWW for about $4-6.  Ordered a few tacos, shredded chicken and the steak with corn tortillas. Got smashed potatoes and rice for sides, and I'd recommend it. The tacos are a decent size. The avocado cream was good, maybe I'd like to see real sliced avocado but still good. It was a little slow in the bar but it was also 3:30p on a Saturday in July.  If I'm back in the area sometime I'd consider stopping in."}
{"text":"3/13/2018 Yelp Review Loco Patron Scottsdale, AZ 4228 N Scottsdale Rd, Scottsdale, AZ 85251 (480) 874-0033  On Tuesday nights at Loco Patron in Old Town it can be difficult to find a table, but usually after 5-10 minutes of waiting my friends and I are able to snag one on the patio. The Mexican-themed restaurant/bar itself is built similar to other restaurants in Old Town, with a small interior and a larger patio jutting out to give great views of the city. The restaurant is located in the heart of Old Town next to Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers, and less than a block away from Scottsdale Fashion Square. If you sit inside, the lighting is fantastic with bright walls which feature giant murals of the beach. The bar top features a patio seating side, with an open window to serve patrons sitting at the bar top outside.   Despite how busy it is every time I've been there,  there is always a friendly, upbeat server who brings water and drinks to the table in a timely manner. The servers never seem to be overwhelmed by the large volume of customers and are attentive. The food is always delivered to the table promptly. I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes for food, and at slower hours I receive my meal in 10 minutes.   After living in Arizona for over 15 years, I have eaten many tacos and have become somewhat picky about them at certain restaurants. A lot of restaurants throw a few bland pieces of chicken and lettuce onto tortillas, but not Loco Patron. They stuff their tacos to the top of the tortillas and serve them in taco holders to keep them warm and from falling apart. My favorite item is their \"Award-winning crunchy chicken tacos\". The crispy shells are filled with seasoned fried chicken, sour cream, pico de gallo, avocado, and sprinkled white cheese at the top. I would also recommend the \"crispy fish tacos\" which are filled with fried fish and topped with marinara sauce and what tasted like blended cheeses and some sprinkled cheese on top. They also serve a basket of chips and salsa on the house. The salsa tastes a little strange, so I always order a side of guacamole with them instead. If you're wanting dessert afterwards, try the sopapillas. Their bowl of vanilla ice cream with sugary dough bites is delicious.  The prices are fair for the quality of food and the location they are in. The tacos range in price from $4-$5 per taco and have the option of a $12 taco plate with two tacos and two sides. The best deals are (obviously) on Taco Tuesday, which features the fish tacos and a few other soft tacos for $2 each and the crunchy chicken tacos for $3 each. Chips and guacamole are served for $4 on Tuesdays. The most expensive entrees on the menu are $14.   Overall, Loco Patron has great Mexican food and is in a great location. One word of advice: if you go on a Tuesday, head out to dinner earlier. They are always packed at night and occasionally run out of some items. [529 wds.]"}
{"text":"Well it's hard to justify a $13 burrito, but that is now the average price of the thing. So prices went up about $2.00 on every item, but it appears they left the happy hour prices intact. Very few burritos are worth that price and although a good item, this is overpriced. I had the AZ burrito last night and it was good with finely chopped ribeye, smashed potatoes and sour cream. The waffle fries, normally good, were greasy this time around. If you can make this into two meals, it still is a worthy investment, but burrito and $13 don't go together. Chips and salsa still free."}
{"text":"Never again!! This place is a joke.. I ordered food, waited over 40 minutes only to receive the wrong meal. I waited another 20 minutes for the waitress to come check on us. At this point I was told my meal would be comped as I was not able to reorder due to time constraints. Just ten I was told my order was ready this whole time and they brought it out just before the check came. I explained that I didn't have any more time to eat and then noticed I was charged in full. So I am about $13.00 deep and I still have not had lunch.. If I could leave  less starts I would!!"}
{"text":"Loco Patron is my favorite bar to go have a great time with my friends! All of us can get quality tacos and a good selection of alcohol for a great price that can fit in anyone's budget! Family friendly and great staff! Definitely recommend this place to anyone in the Tempe area"}
{"text":"Lunch break on a Sunday.  Labor Day weekend. Hardly anybody there. I order salt and pepper wings. First they were extremely salty and second when I bit into one it was mushy. It looked raw. I mentioned it to the waitress that it looked strange and all she said was it was special and then she walked away without looking at it."}
{"text":"I went on $1 Taco Tuesday, and my drink was only $3. I thought this was a bargain! It was not busy when I was there. I was there in the afternoon. Maybe it gets busier in the evening. I preferred to go when it was not busy so I did not have to wait long for service. I sat on the outdoor patio, so the only bad thing about the place that I experienced was a homeless pan handler approach me on the patio and approach one other couple that was eating outdoors. If I had been sitting inside, this man would not of bothered me. However, the staff at Loco Patron asked the homeless man to leave. The bartender was extremely nice and I was satisfied with how the staff handled the situation with the vagrant. But I did go back to Loco Patron 3 days later and I saw the same homeless man hanging around the patio area again."}
{"text":"We waited for a good 10 minutes before we got to order drinks and another 40 minutes for our food witch was good but not great service here sucks I wouldn't advice coming here there are better choices in the area"}
{"text":"If your craving some tacos or a burrito in Tempe, this is your place.   I started going because is convenient to my job for luncheons.   It's a little pricey, but I have found myself addicted to the AZ burrito and the protein bowl.  Food is delicious and service is always outstanding.  Waiter and bartenders ensure you feel welcome and check on you and ask now the food tastes.  It's nice to feel welcome in a place that serves fantastic food.  Loco patron has absolutely earned my business and loyalty."}
{"text":"My favorite spot.  I ALWAYS GO HERE WHEN I COME TO TOWN L9VE IT.  Great staff, awesome food and drinks"}
{"text":"The place is filthy, indoors and out. The drinks are subpar. The food...uh, don't know, we ordered a chicken quesadilla and 40minutes later, asked about it, she said it's coming, 15more minutes and still nothing. Shoot, I could have driven home, made one myself, eaten it and been back in that amount of time!   Smoking at the end of the patio which does not contain the smoke. Also, people just stand around outside the patio rail smoking and looking at the TVs. The whole experience was bad, bad, bad.   Suppose it's all right if your 20-something, looking to get cheap drinks and be seen in Old Town.   Oh, not to mention they had a tiki on the 'hostess' stand wearing a sombrero! A sombrero! Tikis are not Mexican! You'll anger the tiki gods by dressing them in a sombrero!"}
{"text":"Worst food and drinks ever! You have to try to screw up Mexican food this bad. If you can't call yourself a restaurant, then you should at least be able to call yourself a bar. Terrible!  Salsa was like water, guacamole tasted like it came from a bag, margaritas must have had perfume in them. Therefore, once disappointed, we thought it would be safe to order a beer, but even that stunk. Came out in a can. Who serves beer in a can at a restaurant.  Between 4 people for an entree and drink our bill was $95. They should pay us to eat and drink this crap!"}
{"text":"Went back with some friends (it was convenient honestly); and was really disappointed.  Innitially sat by the bar; moved within seconds cause the bartender had an attitude... Not welcoming at all. Seriously, quit your job if you can't deal with people.  Sat in a high table. Waitress had a smile, but was not attentive.  Between forgetting the waters, taking forever to come take our orders, never cared to offer more chips, making us feel rushed \"WHENEVER\" she was by the table; what pissed me off is just having us wait for the bill to be picked up for quite awhile as she and other staff members walked by it. Eventually someone else (not her) picked it up.... I just didn't get it. Being that it was NOT busy. If it was busy, especially being a saturday night, then okay; give you a pass & a decent tip for trying. But nobody there cared. And being my 3rd time with the lack of a caring service; it's not a \"bad night\" excuse.   Oh. The food sucked too.  I thought I was the only one, but when the 3 others complained about lack of taste and the meat being hard & rubbery; I knew I wasn't being a diva!  Lol!   And I don't know who picks the music, they might have the worse DJ on Mills.... From Ol' Dirty Bastard & Tupac to EDM; it was hard to get a rhithym going there!!!!   DEF THE LAST TIME! :("}
{"text":"Nice local place and food is good. Only downside is the patio is usually full of smokers and now that the weather is nice they open up the windows which draws the smoke inside."}
{"text":"The place inside seems a little dirty.  Our table was sticky so we moved to the outside patio. The patio was really nice. They had the tower heaters which was perfect cause it was getting a bit cold at night. The waitress & staff were really helpful & polite. The chips & salsa were just ok. The music was awesome! We had the cactus pear Jumbo Margarita (on the rocks) which was recommended to me by the waitress. It was no bueno. The taste was no different than any other margarita you could find in a bottle at 7-11. All you could taste was the syrup, which left us wondering if they put any liquor in the $20 drink.  Overall I wouldn't go for the margaritas but maybe try a different drink."}
{"text":"First and last. I was there for 15 mins and i had to walk to the bar to place my order. Order 4 times a beer that never arrived. One of my lucky companions dare to order yet another beer and arrive 15 mins later... I think I never got mine. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"If you like super poor quality food but cheap and cheap drinks this is your place.  I don't hate on the cheap drinks but the food is terrible.  Id rather have Taco Bell (and I dont even like Taco Bell).  Definetly my least favorite place for happy hour- the place is small and crowded.  I dread when my friends want to meet here.  Much better places out there."}
{"text":"Well two years since I dined here on Tuesday, but I was back and it was jammed up with college kids on this night of the All-Star Game. The tacos have slightly increased in prices by like 50 cents each. The ground beef taco was still the same, but the corn tortillas were bigger and the ingredients mostly the same. The crunchy fish I heard was good as well, but the $4 frozen or on the rocks margarita was perhaps the best item. Free chips and good salsa of course and a fast efficient staff was handling the college kids (and me) just fine. The amount of TV sets was perfect also as you can the action from almost anywhere. Bravo."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars. Service was good, the all day happy hour $3 tacos were served very quickly and were delicious. Atmosphere is cool-kinda the generic Mexican meets sports bar theme, but I'm not complaining!"}
{"text":"ok place for HH,Stopped in before the fireworks,Cheap prices on beer and HH food,$4 for 6 wings carrots n celery not bad,had habenero mango(not hot at all)Servers were attentive enough,not a bad place for HH.Bill was $13 for 2 big beers n wings"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the outdoor space has greenery, fun and adult-sizes games. The service is on point and the outdoor swing is fun. What more could I say? I didn't want to leave! In short, go here every time you're in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour prices, which are available even on weekends.  The food was okay.  I had a cheese crisp and refried beans and it did the trick.  The environment is definitely more fun sports cantina, so may not be the vibe for everyone, but I plan on going back with friends."}
{"text":"I've been going here for several years now and primarily for watching sports.  They have a lot of TV's and you can see them no matter where you sit.  The food has always been just OK.... it's primarily Mexican but they make a great cheeseburger too.  However, the service has always been sketchy.  We arrived later on Sunday afternoon as the football crowd was starting to leave.  Place was still about half full, and they had plenty of waitresses.  We were almost completely ignored.  While tables all around us were getting visited multifple times, I had to wave my arms and flag her down for everything.  And by everything, I mean our first drink and appetizer.  A full half hour went by and she didn't even ask if we wanted to order food.  We wanted to, but by now had given up.  I had to chase her down at the bar just to give her my credit card to pay for what little we were able to order.  Really pathetic service considering the number of waitresses available."}
{"text":"Totally not really into this place.  Had a taste of every taco.  Meh.  Give me a BEER!  They have awesome atmosphere and they have beer thats it."}
{"text":"Not sure where to start. Went for Taco Tuesday & HH as for the food it was ok, the crunchy tacos that they are known for are much better, so worth it too.   HOWEVER!! Watch out for the waitresses, especially if they are talking to some guy cause I got rammed into by a waitress carrying a box, which sprained the shit out of my right wrist! And the waitress just said \"oops\" and kept going! Seriously! So I told the bartender which was only helping out her BF a manager and all I got was a bag of ice!! That's it!? Not an apology nothing, I got nothing but the bill and a damn bag of ice! I couldn't even get a few minutes of the managers time. As much as I have come here I'm surprised and now think this is why a lot of my friends don't come here anymore and why it's not as busy as it should be. As a chef, I would be pissed if my FOH staff ignored a customer as this place ignored me!"}
{"text":"Came for a March Madness game, about 4:00 on a Friday. The patio was almost full but we snagged a spot and parking was very easy in the free ramp.  We ordered couple beers to start, then guac (4/5, very good flavor), queso (5/5, nice and spicy) - both needed more chips when served. We each ordered 2 diff tacos (soft, chicken - 2.5/5, average) (lobster, soft - 5/5, wow!) my husband thought the street taco was awesome too. We also tried margaritas on the rocks (5/5, some of the best we've had out, not too sweet and made fresh)  All in all, our server was really nice, attentive and the atmosphere was great. Plus the food and drinks were way better than we expected. We'll be back and glad we stopped in!"}
{"text":"Easily the best happy hour spot on Mill. I've been in Texas all summer and still can't find a better margarita.... Drink up!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating, local vibe, decent frozen margaritas and tasty tacos.  We like to go on Taco Tuesdays with the Phoenix family as it is practically around the corner, the girls love their waitress and we love the margaritas and shrimp tacos.    Forget the ground beef tacos as they are mediocre.  Chips and salsa are decent but not memorable.    If you want REALLY good food and frozen margaritas then go to Z-Tejas."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been going here for years. One of the best Taco Tuesday spots in Old Town Scottsdale. Erica, Cassie, Kera and Allison and the best!"}
{"text":"Best food and staff, fast and amazing service. Queso is to die for. Burritos are huge and the wings are amazing"}
{"text":"Overall the place looks run down. Service is below standard and bar rescue would have a field day. Better off going next door to cold beer and cheeseburgers!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't all that great, the cheese on nachos was disgusting! Kind of cheese that the taste stays with you for days.  But the beer kept coming quick and drinks were very good.  We had some fish tacos, nothing special there, guppy on a tortilla with slaw.  Nice to be outside area."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. I would have lived a long happy life not having entered Loco Patron. The crowd is creepy alcoholics, douchey jock stereotypes, frat boys and sad, hysterical hos. The inside is so dark you can barely see the person opposite you and the tone of the place is set when you arrive for dinner at 7PM and are CARDED.   So why on earth am I giving this place 3 stars? Well it's really 2.5 but honestly the food was solid, middle of the road tex mex and the portions were large for their price, making the meal I had a value. The $6.50 quesadilla with green chilies was made with what can only be described as the world's largest tortilla. It had to be a 30\" one because it was folded over and still looked enormous. There wasn't too much cheese in it, but enough to not feel stingy, though the accompanying guac and pico de gallo was not nearly enough for the magnitude of that quesadilla. We were in on a Tuesday night which is $1/$2 taco night and I did try the mahi mahi taco on the soft corn tortilla and liked it. I don't really like mahi mahi because it's regularly cooked to death and tastes like nothing, but the topping made it a nice $2 treat.   If someone brought this food to your house and served it to you without telling you where it was from you would enjoy it. But Loco Patron is a charmless restaurant/bar that should be avoided."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times because again, right around the corner from my salon. I so want to be able to give it a higher rating but every time I go the service is really not that great. Last week I went for wing and Wii night, 30 cent wings cant be beat. I have had better wings, but hey this is a Mexican joint and our bill was not even $4! But our waitress looked like she could care less about being there, never asked if we wanted a refill on our chips and salsa and never stopped by the table to see if we like our food. Now being in the service industry and having spent many years as a server I get that you think since the bill is so low your tip is going to suck. That simply doesn't have to be the case, we left our server a $6 tip and we weren't even there long. You get 4 tables like that an hour you are set, so perk up and smile, you never know how far that can go.  I went there last night for Taco Tuesdays, $1 to $2 tacos can't be beat and the tacos are so tasty I always order 3, the mahi, crunchy fish and steak. The mahi was flaky and sweet, the crunchy taco had a sweet taste to it with the sauce and red onion. Not greasy at all. The steak was tender and flavorful. Again though our service was sub par. We had already finished our chips and salsa before we even got our water, took way to long, same with the food and it wasn't even that busy. We were sitting inside and there were only 20 people in the bar area and there was only one other table eating. Now our server wrote our order on her had, she seemed tired and frazzled, and we had to bring our bill to her at the end to check out, we waited a while before doing that. It seemed like she might have been the only server in the place, but she did have the help of a gentleman by the name of Frenchy. I liked Frenchy, big dude but with dry wit and he seemed like the jack of all trades for the place. Doorman, food runner, busser, you name it he was doing it.  I will continue to come to Loco because the tacos are so damn good but I just hope they figure out the staff issues. I gave it 4 times and every time my complaint is the same, the service needs to step it up."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service here. I've unfortunately been here probably a dozen times, and EVERY time I've had bad service. I've heard other people say that the only reason they are still in business is because there aren't a lot of other options around in the Foothills, especially places with patio seating.   I usually have to re-order items several times, because they will tell me they're bringing my drink or food, and then it never shows up.   I've even sent back drinks after they brought me the wrong drink, and they poured it into a different glass and sent it back to me?!   But credit where credit is due, their ceviche is very good. So is the salsa, the guacamole, sopapillas. Avoid the street tacos, they smell like a diaper. Most of the rest of the menu is hit and miss, even from one day to the next."}
{"text":"Did not honor website prices, overcharged on a la carte lunch specials, and charged extras without warnings. And every table was available at noon. Coincidence? I think NOT!!  What happened to the restaurant that was here under the same name a year ago!?!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place and I will be back often. The food is good and they have low carb options. You know I love that. You can order any of there tacos as lettuce wraps. BUT even better than that they have a cauliflower dish that is amazing. Yeah I know amazing cauliflower but I speak the truth. Add some grilled shrimp and heaven."}
{"text":"Love this place. Drinks are reasonably priced and trust me they don't taste watered down. We come here after every ASU game and for get together a. Conveniently located next to the light rail!"}
{"text":"I work on Mill and walk past this spot every day trying to find something to eat for lunch. Went in yesterday for the first time with some of the guys and was very pleasantly surprised. Food (tacos) was great, happy hour drinks were delicious and reasonable, and our server (Kayla) was super friendly and knowledgeable. Will definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Happy hour was pretty good. 5 dollar tequila was tasteful but the jumbo shareable margarita was too much for a single person. My favorite was the 7 dollar waffle asada fries. Overall i would def come back. Beer was cold and crisp."}
{"text":"My favorite place on our visit to Scottsdale.  Food was excellent and a great drink selection.  TVs everywhere and a lot of fun outside games from bag toss to putt putt golf.  For only being open a month, the management has this place running smooth.  Very impressed with all the friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food was bland. The atmosphere at the bar was nice with half the bar opening up to the outside. The drinks were a bit pricy but well mixed. The night life is better then most places nearby. While we have not taken advantage of it, they have a jumpy house outside for the kids on most Sundays. I would give it a try for evening drinks but do not expect much from their food."}
{"text":"My husband, my brother in-law and I walked into this bar at the end of the World Cup game today at 5pm on the dot. Outside the bar there was a sign that read \"$1 American beers 3pm-6pm\" the sign clearly EXPLICITLY stated until 6pm. When we inquired about the beer special the gentleman in the american flag t-shirt rudely informed us that the special \"was only good until the end of the game and the game is over. The sign was only there to attract customers for the game and we are no longer offering the special.\"   Needless to say this business certainly lost a new group of customers. When you advertise something you should honor it. I work in customer service and I would never treat anyone this way. There were many other possible outcomes for this situation that would've provided us a positive experience. We made our way next door to Cold Beers and Burgers and happily gave them our business.   I would encourage whomever owns or manages this business to correct their signage before wrongly \"correcting\" their customers. We definitely will not be returning to this bar. Not only was there false advertising but the person behind the bar was also incredibly unfriendly."}
{"text":"I never thought I would find myself saying this, but I'm a fan of Loco Patron.  For some reason, and not to discredit Fred M., every time I've stopped by this place has been jammed.  It's especially great during spring training, as everyone's looking for an ice cold margarita to cool down after paying $8 for beers at the Giants stadium.  Service is usually pretty quick, even when the bar is packed.  That can be really tough to do and so few bars do it well.  The only downside is having a tough time finding a place to sit.  In fact, I'm not sure that I've ever even taken a seat in this bar.  My 'glass is half full' side tells me that at least you get to work the legs out a bit.  I've never eaten here so I can't comment on the food.  I often forget that people are even there to eat until I'm stumbling past their tables on the way to another bar.  Maybe some day I'll relax and grab a bite here to comment on that aspect."}
{"text":"Always friendly staff. Love their margaritas. Having tacos tonight. Love their new design  Also the kids love the environment, however I don't recommend bringing kids in the evenings after say 9:00 the crowd is much more adult and the bar and dining rm are not separate"}
{"text":"It's ok. Lotsa cougars. Food is not that interesting, just Mexican bar food. Cheap tacos. Tons of kids on weekend."}
{"text":"Sadly, due to numerous occasions of having rude service my husband and I will never return. Every time we went we had the same rude and unfriendly bartender-Bri (with the shaved head).   It makes me so angry to think about how rude she was on each occasion. Clearly there is lack of management. It's too bad because we live down the street. But now we will go to Native New Yorker.   The only reason for two stars instead of one is because they have really good salsa."}
{"text":"After a Garth Brooks fantastic concert we stopped by for the first time! I was starving no food served after 11:00 ugh People that work here not so friendly, better luck next time!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on one of our stops during my wife's birthday tour.   Food was good. The Buffalo Shrimp was crazy good, but everything else was really mediocre (taste wise) especially the \"Mexican\" food. It's just... not.  The ambiance is great, and the service was really good as well. I would definitely come back here and just stick to the appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"Omg amazing is really all I can say. I'm from out of town and was just walking around and stumbled upon this place. At first glance it looks like a hipster bar that serves frozen burritos, but the moment your food arrives prepare to be amazed. I had the smothered burrito and my girl friend had the chicken fajitas. Neither of us were able to finish the portions are great. Everything perfectly seasoned. Only thing I was unsure about was the Coleslaw but it went perfectly on my burrito. Oh and don't forget about there cherry limeade cocktail, just the right amount of sweet and fruity. Pretty sure everytime I come to Pheonix this is going to be a mandatory stop.   The quality of the food is matched by the quality of service you receive, our server was very cheerful and everyone was dressed nice and the restaurant was very clean. If you are in Scottsdale this is a must."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to this place, I've passed it up multiple times for other bars but regret it now after I tried their food.. Seriously get the protein bowl and the smashed potatoes.. So good. The staff is nice I asked them to change the channel to a specific game, it was done in seconds.. Try it out!!"}
{"text":"Tried out the new loco patron and I love the atmosphere! Whether a work lunch or happy hour the outdoor patio is spacious with couches, high tables, and games. The food is tasty as well. They have a great variety of Mexican dishes and even some twists on traditional meals. Colorful place, nice staff, and good food!"}
{"text":"great food and drinks. Loved the watermelon margarita and the taco specials. Happy hour has great specials."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another shot.  This time around I was sober, and thus have actual memories.  After grabbing a drink my friend and I decided to head out to the patio.  A group of 3 guys graciously let us share their table since the place was packed.  A short period later one of the guys pours his drink into the candle holder and storms off.  I made a comment about it being his time of the month and I'm not so sure they appreciated it because they all left.  Although, the most sober of the bunch seemed embarrassed.  Whatever, free table, woohoo!  Next table starts having a beer fight.  I'm not kidding.    I then started feeling really old.  And overdressed.  An employee comes by to clean up the empty bottles from my table and notices the candle holder full of liquid.  I told him about the guy with PMDD.  He made a little joke about the the guy being upset over my rejection of him.    Final analysis- Patron has some cool employees and some not so cool customers."}
{"text":"Was a little worried about the poor reviews and especially with the service.  There was a large birthday party next to us but our server, Brittany, did a fantastic job.  She was attentive, friendly and did a great job providing A+ service for our group.  Food and beverages were good."}
{"text":"Wow, husband and I ate in Scottsdale location last night.The food here is not the typical plate swimming with cheese and beans! I ordered the barbacoa taco, the best taco ever! I am looking forward to return for the carnitas.  Service from Andy was over the top. This is our new \"go to\" restaurant."}
{"text":"They messed up my order. I went to the bathroom and they just cleared my spot. I had planned on taking my chips and cheese dip and guacamole with me, and finish drinking my water. So I'm not impressed. Food was good portions and the waitress was very nice. Food a little bland, but I didn't add any jalapeños. They gave me a free complimentary order , but I wasn't in the mood any longer."}
{"text":"Service was horrible!! We were there when 3 other couples were in the entire establishment and the slowness in the waitress and bartender... they could care less that ANYONE was in there. In addition, we were very clear in our request for no salt on our margaritas .... they both came out fully loaded with salt. As we reminded the waitress she simply grabbed them, took them over to the bar as we LITERALLY watched the bartender and waitress agree it would be ok to just pour the drink into another cup without salt.... having no care or desire to correct their issue but to handle it as lazily as they could. IF YOU HAVE ANY ALLERGIES OR REQUESTS THIS PLACE DOESNT CARE ONE BIT!!"}
{"text":"We go here every Tuesday, they have the best atmosphere in Tukee.  No scottsdale kids, and dollar tacos.  This place rocks.  The hot wings burnt my butthole for 2 days, they were awesome!  I shall stumble home from you tonight!"}
{"text":"Great taco Tuesday spot! They have amazing chicken tacos and queso dip! I love the patio, the misters get everything wet but this is Arizona, they are a must. So close to the Scottsdale nights scene. Every other day of the week I haven't been much impressed. Definitely go on a Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Loco Patron did not earn our repeat business tonight. Judging by the crowd they don't need it. If enough people have a similar experience that we did maybe they'll start caring about their customers.   Positives: fantastic atmosphere, great craft beer & cocktail selection. Oh and the corn elote appetizer was fantastic. Negatives: horrible service and the entrees were a combination of over & under cooked.  We were disappointed as we were looking forward to checking this place out. The patio is AMAZING as is the ambiance inside & we loved the TV's with sports on every screen. However we should've known when we walked up when there was no one at the hostess stand. The hostess arrived & she put our names down with a 10 minute wait & we found seats at the bar to order a drink.  The bartender took our drink order right away and brought us our drinks but then disappeared for 20 minutes. We decided that if the hostess ever came looking for us we would get a table as we could tell the bartender was horrible. Sadly the hostess never came looking for us to tell us that our table was ready.   Finally another bartender came over and we ordered the corn elote & each got an order of tacos. While we waited for our food the first bartender took or fresh margarita order (they were fantastic!). She told us that she would get us silverware \"if she could find it\". She must not have been able to find it as we had to beg the other bartender for silverware after our corn elote arrived 20 minutes later. The corn elote was AMAZING however or entrees arrived 5 minutes later (before we could finish the appetizer).   My carne asada tacos were overdone, dry & cold. My wife's tacos were not as cold however we both ordered a side of Spanish rice & the rice was under cooked. In a lifetime of dining experiences I have NEVER had under cooked rice, which was a shame because the rice had a lot of flavor.  We would have enlightened the staff as to our thoughts on our meals however NO ONE asked us how our meals were. We thought about looking for a manager however every time we looked to the hostess stand there was NO ONE there. Finally as we were leaving the hostess was there however there was a line of people waiting for a table.  Overall a very disappointing dining experience, which was a surprise since this is an established restaurant with a location in Old Town. Maybe they just need to work the kinks out but I doubt that we'd go back given our bad experience and that we can get better Mexican food with better service at half the price across the parking lot at Habaneros."}
{"text":"Oh Loco Patron!  How you disappoint me so!   We tried to ignore the reviews and give you a second chance.   My son orders coconut shrimp just to be told the don't have any after we waited for a while.  He switches to lobster only to be told minutes later they don't have those either.   Tortillas and fries were extremely stale.  The beans tasted more like mud hummus.  My mahi mahi taco had one piece of fish about 3/4 long.  My little guys chicken quesadilla came sans chicken.    Just avoid this place if you have any expectations of good food or service."}
{"text":"A fun vibe - good music, happy people, yummy margaritas and food! Chips and salsa were good, ordered chicken fajitas and beef tacos. Fajitas were better than the tacos but no complaints!"}
{"text":"Had the mahi mahi fish tacos and a skinny margarita. Fish tacos were standard sub-par fare for $13. The flour tortilla was old and bland. Fish and fillings tasted ok though. Margarita was an utter disaster. I don't know what it was but it tasted gross. I had to add few more limes to make it less thick and bitter, but still only ended up drinking a third of it.  It'll do if you're just looking for somewhere with outdoor seating for a bite to eat, but there are better options in the area."}
{"text":"Friends and I usually go to the Scottsdale location, but I live in Tempe so I'm super happy they opened one here!  Love it on Taco Tuesdays! Great specials! $1 tacos and $4 margs!  Our Margaritas last night were really good and strong! Music was loud, crowd was fun, staff was cool!"}
{"text":"Maybe we are too picky about our Mexican food but this was nothing special. We were visiting the area and checked Yelp for ideas. It was 2:00 so we tried their Happy Hour.  The place was empty on a Monday afternoon so had the place to ourselves and the TVs. Nice enough setting for a late lunch. We each ordered a margarita off the regular menu to try something different. The spicy mango margarita and the prickly pear margarita we both good but at full price neither of us wanted another. My husband ordered wings and street tacos off the HH menu, He is a wing man and said they were ok, nothing special. He tried a few different street tacos and had to doctor them to create more flavor.I ordered the Ahi salad. Everything in the salad was fresh just no flavor, too bad because it looked yummy. 2 drinks, a salad off regular menu and 3 street tacos, and 1 order of wings for $60.00 (before tip) seemed a bit high to us."}
{"text":"Have been a semi-frequent guest, however after today's visit, I question their business practice / pricing strategy.  I ordered a John Daley and was charged $9.50 for a well drink...wth... so that's $2.50 for the ice tea $2.50 for a splash of lemon and $4.50 for a shot of well vodka.  I will not be back, there are better bars and resturants in the area that do not pad the check and serve better food."}
{"text":"Love LOCO. Salsa is absolutely amazing, pork tacos are where it's at. Friendly staff, very attentive, decently quick service for lunch. If you have the time to sit and relax, it's a great spot."}
{"text":"Crunchy pork tacos are the best in the valley. Happy hour prices can't be beat. The bartenders are awesome and the servers are  super cute and very friendly. Best happy hour spot in Old Town!"}
{"text":"I come here just about every week, and I order something different every time. And let me tell you...the food is always good. And the servers always greet us promptly with a smile. The atmosphere is great. Plus, the owners could not be cooler and more down to earth. What else could you ask for? 5 Stars."}
{"text":"DAVID is the bomb! Super dope dude! Kept my tequila chilled and coming regularly. Makes a wonderful Margarita. Had the salt n pepper wings but got too \"happy\" to eat them! Typical food. Just a awesome location vibe staff and did I mention how awesome David is?! (:"}
{"text":"The drinks were disappointing for a Friday night out on the town. I ordered the Cadillac margarita and the Loco-lada. Being from Southern California and now living in AZ I've had my share of orgasmic/ fantastic margaritas, so to come here and have the first page of the drink menu be all about margaritas I was really expecting good margaritas. They were both bland and I could hardly tell if alcohol had even made it into the glass. I don't like my alcohol overpowering but I like to know it's at least in my $9-$12 drink!   However...  The saving grace is the salt and pepper wings!!! The habanero wings are great as well!!!   In short, I'd go back for the wings but skip the drinks unless I grab a beer!"}
{"text":"A great place to come if you want a waitress to bitch you out for messing up your order. Shaina, or whatever her name is was one of the most rude servers I've seen. A decent place marred by a terrible waitress. I gave two stars, because the food was pretty good at least.  Seriously though, Shana... Find a job where you don't have to deal with the public."}
{"text":"Came here for the late night happy hour and it was great! Had the carne asada fries and they were so good.  Had some other tacos and wings and loved it.  Didn't love the first tray of complimentary chips but no biggie. Neat environment, very relaxed."}
{"text":"I used to work in the restaurant industry, I know what it is. However, the service I had received for my first time dining there was just okay. I walked in with such a not so friendly hostess in cutoff shorts to the point where her cheeks were hanging out (it's scottsdale, I understand, but you're not in a club.) and proceeded to tell me to sit wherever, no big. but didn't come off with a friendly or welcoming vibe nor was I given a menu to look at. Anyway, my server comes and I ask for a bud light with water, after several minutes of waiting for my beer she gives me a bottle (they have it on draft and that is what I wanted, not that she asked me for my choices anyway) and as I was going to say something, she walked off knowing I was going to ask her something which kind of ticked me off actually. Then I pull the hostess over and ask for a draft and not a bottle. Then the server approaches me and says it will be a few minutes for them to change out the keg. Major turn off to just hand me a bottle i  didn't want because they're out. Anyway, it was changed in time and she gave me a draft. Then I ask for the steak and shrimp fajitas to which about 5 minutes later I forgot to tell her how I wanted the steak done which was actually her job to ask from the start. Finally, I felt that I had put more work as a customer to put my order in than I should have.  On a positive note, everything did come in a timely manner, and the food was excellent. I really like the atmosphere and their selections. Pricing is decent, and I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today because I had a 25% off coupon.  The chips were good... salsa was kind of watery but ok.  Our service was good:).  The food was fine... not the best Mexican I have ever had, but don't think this place even tries to accomplish that.  They want people to come and drink and hang out... maybe have some food.  I paid $6 for my lunch thanks to that coupon I had so I am not going to complain :)."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday's-  Busy, good music. Service- only had 3-4 waitresses on staff working the whole restaurant. Waited a long time to get our checks.  Food- the tacos were below satisfying. Barely any meat on them and little to no flavor. Asked for a water to go with my tacos with hot sauce but never got one.  The restaurant itself seems to be dirty like they don't mop everyday.  Would I go back? Most likely not.  Will only go back because friends refuse to go to horrible hefe"}
{"text":"The struggle is real... between a one-star or two star-review. Ultimately, I gave two stars because some of our food was good and the margaritas were tasty. Here are the details though.  We (a group of five) arrived for a late dinner on a Saturday night. It wasn't busy at all, so we sat outside. I totally get that this location is new, but if I were the manager, I would have relocated some of the Old Town staff to this location while working out the kinks. It was obvious our server was new. She seemed brand new to the industry.  We sat down and immediately ordered drinks. The spicy margarita was not spicy at all, but had a good flavor. The house margarita was delicious. The spicy mule was so bad, we sent it back. We were never offered water and finally had to ask for it after about 30 minutes (during which time our server was MIA).  We ordered an appetizer of three dips - the roasted corn salsa, guacamole and bacon bean dip. Instead of getting the roasted corn salsa, we got the house salsa (which was not good). We asked the server to clarify which salsa we got (didn't want to accuse if we got what we asked for), and she said she couldn't see it because it was dark out. She did bring us the roasted corn salsa anyway. She said she would bring us plates and then didn't for probably 15 minutes. We asked for napkins. She brought those 10 minutes later, and basically threw five napkins at my sister to distribute to everyone.  For an entree, I ordered two tacos: the grilled shrimp and the crunchy taco made with carnitas. The grilled shrimp was fine, except that it came with two small shrimp. The carnitas were absolutely awful. They were completely charred and hard. I took one bite and spit it out. The shell for the shrimp taco was supposedly handmade that day, but it was so chewy that it was hard to bite into and tasted like it had been sitting out for days.  Others had the traditional pizza (fine), chorizo pizza (good), burrito bowl with carne asada (good) and more tacos (okay). One of us had a salad as well, and it came with no dressing. She asked to get a to-go box for it and to get a side of dressing, and our server said, \"I'm not sure about the dressing... I'll bring it if I can get it.\" WHAT?!   All in all, drinks were good, food needs some help, and service left much to be desired. I would be inclined to return to try other dishes, but the service was just so horrible."}
{"text":"Loco Patron has become our new neighborhood haunt.  I'm a fan of their Loco Trio.  Big portion sizes, low prices, good margaritas, and Wednesday night poker. Definitely a sports bar with a Mexican flair."}
{"text":"Where else can I get seriously cheap eats, music that makes me want to get up and dance on the table tops, and enjoy the Old Town scenery any night of the week?   Loco Patron knows how to do Taco Tuesday and pretty much happy hour, including reverse happy hour! Love love love it! They want you to stay and they do everything to make you enjoy being planted in your bar stool. First off, the DJ spins beats that flirt with you to burn some calories before partaking in the caloric intake. Bartenders are not only easy on the eyes, but they know how to serve up fun and goodness. My fave are their salt and pepper wings, get a side of hot sauce to dip even though they are so good naked. The shrimp tostadas are amaze balls, order several because you won't share. With the drink specials, you won't realize you might have slammed several beers and decided to buy the entire patio a round of shots to join you in your drunken fest of happiness. You'll never look at your phone, even to capture the pixels of a really good time!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Had the pork enchiladas and they were very good. Good service and bar staff. Prices were competitive for the area."}
{"text":"Great taco Tuesday deals here which is a completely different build your own style menu than the regular menu. Everything I've tried from the regular menu has been delicious as well. If you're a Wisconsin badger fan this is the place to come on game days! This is where you will find all of the other badger fans in the area. They offer a separate badger themed menu on game days which includes some Wisconsin classics like brats."}
{"text":"{first visit} and I'm officially a *fan*   I will be back. And I haven't even closed out my tab.  Came down to watch the Portland Timbers play, munch on some tacos and get a beer.   Thanks Camillo for the recommendation!!!!   Thus far Loco Patron has served the best 'restaurant' tacos since I've been in Arizona, and trust the hubs and I are on a mission.   I ordered he steak and pork crunch tacos. You CAN'T go wrong. I also recommend the 'street taco' the salsa that comes on that...WOW...yes please, sign me up, I want!!!!!   The chips and guac is great too! They put fresh cilantro on the chips which allows the flavor to spread amongst the chips...seriously an awesome twist I've never experienced.   The tacos are great, the service is on point, music is engaging and if you need to watch a sporting event, there's enough TVs to go around.   // cheers //"}
{"text":"I come here after kickball every Friday. Not only is their food delish (tostada bites & shrimp ceviche!!! To die for!!!) but their staff is awesome! Donella is fantastic & while I'm sure the rest of the staff is awesome as well, I make sure to plan my visits around when she's working! If I can't visit when she's there I love that you can have them delivered through postmates!"}
{"text":"We were on vacation and looking for a place to watch the Packer/Dallas playoff game last weekend.  If you're a fan of the Green Bay Packers and/or Wisconsin Badgers this is a great place to catch the games.  They televise all of the games and it's filled with Packer fans.  Good tacos/ nachos and reasonably prices drinks.  The patio has heaters in cooler weather."}
{"text":"Loco Patron is a great addition to the area.  Completely redone facility with a new micro brewery on site.  Terrific heated outdoor seating with large bar between interior and exterior sections.  TV's at every location plus a game area. Excellent tacos for \"taco Tuesday\" with a side of black beans, pinto also available.  Definitely plan to return soon."}
{"text":"Great food and fun on Clean Comedy night a few weeks ago.  Packed house.  A complete success.  Hope you guys do it again and again and again."}
{"text":"The food is terrible here. The only good part of our visit was the waitress. Left her a nice tip. When the restaurant ran the charge thru my bank they rounded up and claimed it was an error because my writing was hard to read.  I'll admit the up charge was only .72 cents but It's my money not yours,  the manager didn't seem to get that.  After a week manager finally called back but you could tell she was bothered by the whole issue.  2 stars for the waitress."}
{"text":"This place rocks!! Their food is tasty, hot and authentic! Drinks are strong and margaritas were the BEST!!! Servers were semi attentive but they were almost busy!!"}
{"text":"Owner responded to me and apologized for the poor service the day I was there. Hoped I would return and give it another chance. Keep you posted"}
{"text":"This place is really really good. Street tacos, queso and guac, and margaritas are the highlights. Kera is usually my server, shes super positive attitude and helpful and never messes up the order!"}
{"text":"We decided with the grilled shrimp taco plate and a cup of tortilla soup while enjoying live entertainment by a solo guitarist.   Enchiladas vs chimichangas...one of our kids couldn't recall what he ordered but either way, seemed very happy with his Enchiladas.  We teased with him for the rest of the night about not knowing what he ordered.   The hubby and I loved the shrimp taco and I pretty much ate ALL the soup!! .  I don't share very well when I love a meal!  Not surprising, there was quite a crowd on a week night!"}
{"text":"The food here is ok, but that's about it.  Service was also ok, nothing more.   Menu says the first order of chips/salsa is free.  We had to ask for it.  Chips come in a wicker basket, but there was no paper liner so not sanitary.  Second basket is $1, but they brought it for free (there were six of us and the basket was tiny).   We specified what we wanted on our tacos, but when they came out they had everything on them.  Not great for picky eaters or those with allergies.   Also, it was 7pm on a Spring Break Monday.  Not many people there, but they had no steak (which was featured on the menu).   Nothing really wrong or bad, just not a destination.  If your drinking heavily and don't care, you might write a better review."}
{"text":"Really?????!!!!????  5 broken glasses including 4 shot glasses chipped on the rim.  Unacceptable. If I swallowed glass I would have had to call a lawyer.  Terrible.  When the bartender was told about the glassware, she examined the glassware and put them back in the dish pit for washing and reuse. Are you kidding me?  Someone needs to order new glassware or replace your garbage staff."}
{"text":"I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by Loco Patron.  I'd seen the location in Old Town but never really thought to try it.  We were headed to Blasted Barley because I know they had the fight on. Parked and started walking down Mill, noticing that the fight was on I chose to go in and pay the cover.  Although as a bar with as many patrons seated they could have just kept to the $40 per table minimum as a couple we exceeded healthily.  Our waitress Keali was extremely fast to serve our table once we came into her section.  we were going to set up in the bar area but the table was in an awkward locale and I feared lack of service.  We moved to the northern end with the windows open.  I ordered the Street and crunchy fish tacos.  I think my Fish taco would have been much better had I chose not to take my time and gotten after it.  The Chipotle Aoli and additional Salsa made the flavors on point.  The Street taco though...the flavors were epic.  My girlfriend ordered the coconut shrimp tacos...had the sweetness part of the flavor, but the coconut was over the top for me.  She also had the Island pork taco, it was ok.  The chips and salsa were good.  I ordered the Cali Cream Ale and the Strawberry Margarita and the lady had the straight margaritas.  Keali wasn't around to be annoying, but she was there at every critical moment to ask about our food and drinks.  Definitely a fun place to watch a fight and easy sell to eat again should I be out of ideas."}
{"text":"Hubby and I invited to a  HH and we all met at the Loco Patron. We came in a little late so others in our group ordered a pretty large selection of bar food. Hubs and I added to that order with cheese curds and a shrimp ceviche. As far as drinks go, I ordered a Tito's and soda, twist of lime. All was going great until a darling female friend asked the bartender for another drink for me. Skillet, the bartender was in the corner talking to the waitresses, EASILY dismissed her drink order and when she turned around, he mouthed, \"what the f*ck\" as he looked at her, her back turned to him. I was SHOCKED and very upset. For someone representing the Loco Patron brand, if this is how an employee treats paying customers I'd rather give my money/business somewhere else.  Spoke to the GM, Lance and he said he would take care of the situation but I need to let the business owner know of this disaster of a bartender and his disrespect to paying customers.  Our bill was big, $300 and a $100 cash tip - we're pretty fair people and we know there are others such as the chef, waitresses, bar backs, etc who hopefully got some of that tip.   If you want to be talked about, behind your back.....sit at the bar and let Skillet the bartender serve you. What a piece of work. My first and last time there.  Skillet, if you read this....you need to show a little respect, smile a little bit more and whatever chip you have on your shoulder, let it go. The girl you spoke about behind her back has a brother with stage 4 stomach cancer so she's kinda going a lot and the ONE night she went out, you spoke poorly of her. Yeah, you are probably the type who will deny it but I saw you, I heard you and I watched you. Shame on you."}
{"text":"Tasteful margaritas and the jalisco mule. Bar is well done and available to the outdoor patio. Service is great, and the complimentary chips and fresh slash were amazing too!"}
{"text":"\"Hey everybody, let's go cram ourselves into a patio until we can't feel our extremities!\"  \"Ummm, that sounds awful, but maybe I'd save some money because I wouldn't be able to get to the bar.\"  \"Save money! No don't worry, you won't do that either. You're pre-mixed margaritas and jack and cokes are going to be at least 8 bucks, so it's impossible to spend an hour cramped elbow to elbow with a bunch of douche bags without at least blowing a couple of sawbucks for no discernible reason!\"  \"Why in the hell would I spend 8 dollars on a lame pre-mixed margarita that tastes like Hi-C?\"  \"Because its pre-mixed and poured by authentic amateur weight lifters whose awesome margarita powers can't be contained in shirts with sleeves even on a 50 degree night!\"  \"Ummm, are there are at least some people in the kitchen who know how to make some decent Mexican food?\"  \"Who knows! With all the douche bags that take over the tables to play drinking games with soiled sugar packets, no one other then tourists actually orders food sober here!\"  \"No offense, I'd rather just get loaded at a Manuel's or something.\"  \"Manuel's! You don't need to drive out to Manuel's when you have top-notch Scottsdale doorman that know all the best restaurants within 40 feet of Loco Patron like My Big Fat Greek to recommend to out-of-towners in case it's too busy in there to hear your children crying!\"  \"Shouldn't a doorman recommend something more authentic and regional to an out-of-towner obviously trying to do something native on their vacation?\"  \"What's more native to Scottsdale then shallow restaurants and people willing to pay anything to crowd together and feel important!\""}
{"text":"Fire tacos, great beers and cool people. Its honestly a great place to be. taco Tuesday is amazing"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a couple years now, definitely my favorite spot on mill! Great food, lots of beers and margaritas, and a fun environment. Usually more relaxed than the rest of mill ave, but come in on a taco Tuesday or an ASU game day and this place gets jumping, get there early to get a spot. I always have to get the crunchy fish tacos and a margarita! They also have a great happy hour during the week, lots of food and drink specials!"}
{"text":"Loco is one of the best places for a good time. Food was amazing and the service could not have been better. I recommend this bar to anyone who wants Mexican food and good margaritas at a cheap price! A+"}
{"text":"Decent food, great location and absolutely horrible service. We went two different times. Same poor service. Management issue. We will not return. Plenty of other places to visit."}
{"text":"I use to like going to Loco Patron it has really gone downhill. Food use to be better that's gone hill too. The place is such a mess it is very dirty. It really needs some TLC."}
{"text":"The crunchy pork tacos are the best tacos in Arizona! They are delicious, you really can't find better tacos anywhere else. They even won 1st place at the most recent Arizona Taco Festival. It's also has the best patio in old town"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent and I love the staff! I've eaten here a countless number of times and the food is always great. I highly recommend the coconut shrimp tacos, Mexican street cart tacos, crunchy pork tacos, the carne asada torta and the chicken wings! (I know wings at a Mexican restaurant sounds random but they're really good here I promise!)"}
{"text":"Stoppped by running errands: great mojito, great tacos- can't wait to try more. Fast service, dog friendly! Coming back with more people next time."}
{"text":"This little hangout is right off the light rail. If it is happy hour, it is a definite place to start out your drinking adventure. The bartenders were really friendly, it was a nice casual atmosphere, and the drink were cheap yet strong. The food didn't look so appetizing so we didn't order any, which is sad, because I love to eat and drink, but overall the place was okay."}
{"text":"Great location, decent food, but really noisy restaurant/bar on Mill Avenue!  The service was incredibly slow too!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place because of some of the reviews I read. They must have listened to the criticism.  Great service, great food, great experience. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome local hangout.  Kind of like cheers!  Great guacamole and awesome margaritas."}
{"text":"We had just completed hiking Hayden Butte, as we normally do most Monday's.  My wife and I were both famished, and I wanted to catch a glimpse of Game 7 of the Warriors vs Thunder game.   We heard the cheers from all the way across the street; therefore, we made our way across Mill Avenue Loco Patron. We've never eaten here before, and this was to be a first for us.   As we entered the premises; Keala, our server promptly greeted and seated us at a booth that gave us ample view of most of the screens - absolutely perfect!  We were going to enjoy a nice dinner, and I was going to get to watch the Warriors move on to the finals. However, much to my dismay, at this time, the Warriors were down 11 points.  I ordered the Mahi Mahi Tacos, and my wife had the Steak street tacos. Both of these were just okay. Nothing special, as far as we were concerned. But, the service provided by Keala was pleasantly efficient. By the time we had finished our meal, the Warrior managed to erase the point deficit and now had a significant 10 point lead, but the game wasn't over yet.  In order to prolong our visit, we ordered dessert in the form of the Sopaipillas, and the Fried Ice Cream. I should've checked the description and inquired as to their sizes because when they were served to us, there was enough here for 4 people.  Needless to say, we didn't even come close to consuming the dessert. But, it definitely was the highlight of our meal. They were both quit delectable. Along with the Warrior's victory, this was quite a pleasant experience for the both of us.   A decent meal, with dessert, and our favorite team moving on to the Finals!"}
{"text":"Was excited about Loco Patron coming to North Scottsdale.  I love the restaurant in old town Scottsdale.  Unfortunately, i was sorrily disappointed.  The flavors and quality of the food are not the same.  I learned from the waitress that this location is not owned by the same people, and hence, why there may be a difference.  May try their brunch, which looked appetizing.  But for lunch or dinner, i will return to old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The lady and I along with the woofy engulfed the plates that were brought before us. We both had the chicken taco plate - shredded chicken and green Chile. Amazing and very refreshing! Beans and Frys were great, however, the Brussel sprouts are something to be revered. Do yourself a favor and try this place out. The patio is gorgeous and the ambience is chill but upbeat. The patio also has water fountains!!! PS - did I mention they are pet friendly on the patio? Plus they have a putting green!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place - great vibes! Margs were bomb.com I had the Cadillac with George Clooney tequila and the lady had the Patron margarita. Staff was super friendly met some good people - Bradley , Erica, and Scott."}
{"text":"Grabbed a late dinner on Thursday night.  I thought the food was good and the beers helped with a full day of traveling.  I liked the atmosphere of this place and sitting outside was nice, considering it was snowing back in NY.  This place is relaxing a good to hang out and chill."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a fabulous brunch here today. We have been here a few times for cocktails only, today we ate at the bar with Mick. Not only was the food terrific, so was the service. Being in the industry a long time I can tell the staff was extremely attentive, knowledgeable and it made for a fabulous Sunday! We will definitely spend our future Sundays here with Mick!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays!!! $2 tacos! Can't beat that! The beer prices could be a little better during happy hour but overall, good place!"}
{"text":"I Love Loco, the patio is great for people watching, the staff is friendly and I always get great service.  The food is FANTASTIC!  The salt & pepper wings are my favorite, which is weird for a Mexican restaurant but I swear you have to try them.  The fish and beef Tacos as well as everything else I have had so far is super yummy!  I would HIGHLY recommend this place too everyone!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a cheap taco Tuesday, with $1, $2, & $3 taco options. But as the saying goes; you get what you pay for. Being on Mill ave will ensure a wild crowd, so do not intend to drop in for a quiet lunch or dinner, and the service had always been slow for us. In any case, still something interesting if you want a festive Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"I really like Loco Patron. They have fish taco's that are delicious and know how to make refried beans. Comfortable place to have good food and a drink. Very pleasant wait staff. Try it, you will like it."}
{"text":"Don't love it or hate it but I know what to expect.   This is not a restaurant were you expect fine dining or authentic Mexican. It's a Mexican themed dive bar. Good only for tequila and beer and fun times with your buddies during happy hour or a bar crawl."}
{"text":"Came here to watch a game and was actually really excited to eat their food! Although after 10 minutes of waiting for menus the busser finally brought us some along with water. After we asked one of the servers for help we watched two other tables come in and get helped before we even got acknowledged. We finally went up and asked for a either a server or manager, they said the manager was working behind the bar and couldn't speak. After 10 more minutes of watching the servers walk around and not say a thing to us we got up and left. The only reason I'd come back is if that busser was our server. Didn't catch his name, but he had longer blonde hair and was the only person that spoke to us in the 30 minutes we were there. Thanks man!"}
{"text":"Good food....they were playing country when we walked in. We took over the jukebox for ten bucks and the vibe changed. Good drinks....service could have been a little more prompt but there was only one server. Great fajitas!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Bad service, subpar food."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is amazing, and service is always ok. Reason for the non-five star review is due to bait and switch of the menu.  Last night while dining in we ordered food based on a menu that was displayed on a clip board. It clearly stated that there was reverse happy hour after 10pm. (Mind you it was 10:15 at this point). The bartender then said that menu was old and it no longer existed.   If you are going to get rid of a special or promotion your menu should reflect those changes. Otherwise it is false advertising to me.   Disappointed."}
{"text":"If you are down and Mill Street, please visit Loco Patron.  Food and Bartenders are amazing.  It's one of favorite places to spend \"Happy Hour\"."}
{"text":"Waiter: Can I get you something to drink? Me: Yes, I would like a Modelo Especial with a lime.  Waiter: I'm sorry but I think we are out of limes. Me: Out of limes? I thought this was a Mexican Restaurant? Waiter: Limes coming up from Mexico are very expensive right now.  Me: I could run across the street and pick a few limes off my neighbor's lime tree. Waiter: (Unimpressed) Me: (Unimpressed)"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised, they had very fresh salsa, just wish it was spicier, and my meal was delicious. The service was great and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Second time coming here ,the first was not very good but this time it was great service and food was fresh and on time  Even thou was a game day the kitchen was fast We ordered 3 burritos and a chicen quesadilla and had good flavors the burritos had warm and not toasted tortillas the ground beef wasjuicy and not over spicy rice and bean were well temperature cook without a sagui flavores or hard shells taste  The service was fast and practical  We got chip and salsa right away also fresh and warm chips,then got our waters and iced teas very fast remember its over 105 Temperature out there,Jaqueline was our server very knowledgeable. And didn't even write the order down and we got our food fast without mistakes. I'm very happy with the service and definely I will be back andso my friends will too."}
{"text":"Hate this place. Service sucks, drinks suck. Food, meh. Ugh, just want a decent Taco Tuesday place. This is not it."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour after work on Friday.   They had a live band that was so loud we couldn't hear what each other was saying.   Most everyone moved to the furthest area away from the band,  they were all complaining about the noise.   One whole area is open to the outside.  On a nice day this would have been great but at 107, it was ridiculously hot.  We had to ask to have the fans turned on.  The food at best was mediocre, nothing special at all.  We will not be returning"}
{"text":"Good place to have beer and tequilla. Not much in terms of wine and eating here was a stretch. I had an appetizer.  Celeb watch: Pablo Sandoval site-ing (which take it from 2 stars to 3)"}
{"text":"Tried twice.  Great atmosphere,  but their kitchen needs a lot of work.  Brown guacamole served twice.  Missing flavor."}
{"text":"Nachos, wings, and Hawaiian tacos are highly recommended, Thursday nights are the best! Great local place in the Tuke."}
{"text":"Had a great Saturday at Loco Patron thanks to David our bartender and server.  He was friendly and in a great mood and interacted well with his customers. The tacos were great and the suggestions were fantastic.  The crunchy carnitas taco was especially good! The manager Chris came by to ask us how our dinner was going and we said what a great employee he has in David.  Chris was very professional and you can tell he interacts well with his employees.   Another employee Paige was at the bar and continually asked us how our food was. Thanks to the staff at Loco Patron, we will be back tomorrow to try HH with some of our friends."}
{"text":"Good food. And Taco tuesdays always a great option. Wait staff are awesome.  Will be back. Thanks Locos Patron."}
{"text":"$2 Mexican beers on Sunday night.  Probably a good chance of catching something if you went home with any of the sleazy folks that were packed in the bar and patio.  No idea on food quality, but it looked passable from the few people I saw eating."}
{"text":"This place is a great find. Friendly service,  pet friendly patio, reasonable prices and delicious food (we loved the pork & Mahi tacos! )."}
{"text":"Ordered steak salad, buffalo shrimp and a chicken loco bowl.. Food was excellent and the chips and salsa were on point. The atmosphere is great with a nice bar, outside patio and lots of TVs playing sports. Def would come back!"}
{"text":"A fun place to meet up with friends for a drink and quick bite to eat. Their margaritas are good, but a little on the pricey side for not being very strong. I have gone several times, each time the staff is nice and timely with my order. The large TVs make it perfect for the sports fan on game days."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday for the dollar tacos after reading some pretty good Yelp reviews and I wasn't really impressed. The chips were pretty stale and tasteless and my tacos had a ton of lettuce with very little meat. The atmosphere, crowd and DJ were good tho and my margarita was pretty delicious. Not a big fan of the food but I might come back for drinks one day."}
{"text":"I really enjoy everything here. I recommend the honey BBQ spicy wings and nachos or fish crunchy taco. And of course pomegranate margarita. Happy hour its pretty good from 4 to 7 and music its always good. The atmosphere and service is always on point."}
{"text":"For drinks!  Did not eat here. Server was very accommodating on my request for \"skinny\" Marg. No problem, no agave, no sugar. Same price. WOW. Outstanding. Happy hour price.  Thanks. I will be back."}
{"text":"One of my fav's for Taco Tuesday and for hanging out during the weekend nights! This place is more of the laid-back bar/hangout spot which I love! Happy our is always a good time. Staff is friendly and easy-going. The place itself has always been clean, even the bathrooms! I love the big outside patio and did I say their Taco Tuesday?"}
{"text":"Their food is a 3 at best and they often times mess your order up. Salsa tastes purely like purified tomatoes and nothing else. Chips are usually freshly made and tasty. Their tacos and Mexican food in general fall short for me."}
{"text":"The service was fast and the food was good. Not the best Mexican i had, but real good drunk food."}
{"text":"So I came here on a Thursday evening and wow. 2 for 1 drinks for a Thursday night on mills ave is awesome. I was served by heather and tanner, both bartenders are very friendly and gave me good suggestions on their drink menu. I'd definitely come back with my friends for another 2 for 1 night"}
{"text":"It's a good fun place for happy hour. The food is decent, won't exactly blow you away, but the drinks are pretty great."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour! And reverse happy hour!  I loved their lobster tacos... mmmm... .lobster in a taco  Yay!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible! We ordered tortilla soup it was cold and I asked for a small slice of avocado and manager brings me small slice and when check came there was a 2.00 fee! She refused to remove it when I told her she didn't advice me of a fee her response was AVOCADOS ARE EXPENSIVE NOW! and wouldn't remove the fee..and the soup had no flavor! Wouldn't ever go back here or refer it to anyone."}
{"text":"Used to be a great little neighborhood place.  Happy hour all day seems to be the way to go, only way it's affordable.  Had a crunchy chicken taco - not great, especially if I paid full price.    Great little bar if ya wanna cold beer and plenty of TV'S for watching a game and relaxing.  Definitely stop by for the quote \"sports bar experience\""}
{"text":"Very disappointed, on the bottom of the Mexican food barrel. Ordered the Nachos with chicken. Got a plate of chips with a small mount of a weird melted white cheese on one side and a scoop of sour cream on the other. Beneath this was a scoop or two of black beans (straight from a can) with a good amount of oil. Some chunks of chicken, a few peppers. Not very pretty or appetizing. Had to eat most of it with fork and could not eat the bottom 1/4 of it as it was a mess of oil, runny cheese and soggy chips. Not much love put into this dish. My son had a couple of tacos, fish and chicken and his response was \".......not good\". Looks like the place does pretty well as there were a number of customers outside with us, but from the conversation it appeared that most were first timers also. As far as I am concerned, I was a first timer and a last timer. With the amount of Mexican style place in town, this is one that can be avoided, Also seemed a bit over priced, Nachos, 2 tacos and 2 margaritas came to almost $50. I know its Scottsdale but........"}
{"text":"Nice place on the end of Mill. Pretty good food and drinks. Also plays pretty good music.   Not atypical for Mill Ave it's certainly meant for the under 30 crowd. Prices are ok, maybe a little on the higher side. But I enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"i will always remain faithful to this place because every single time i've been here, the Ceviche is amazing.  the service is amazing.  The ambience was amazing.  drinks, amazing.    LOVE LOVE LOVE it here."}
{"text":"Ok I usually go there for the drinks and to have some down time with my friends over the weekend. I've been there multiple times and it never disappoints me. Its a great laid back place to get some good drinks and a VERY reasonable price and good looking bartenders ;) On a Saturday night, this place is usually crowded till 11:30ish and then it dies down. Thats usually when I leave and hit a club, but last weekend we were there till close and it was still fun.   I watched the superbowl this year at loco patron and took advantage of the happy hour. We got nachos, lobster taco and shrimp tacos and they were all very delicious. The server was really nice and attentive to us.   I love this place and so do my friends, so we end up here often."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since it opened and been disappointed both times. I had the nachos the first time and they we're bad, very bland and had zero flavor.  Second time I had the wings and they had zero meat on them, zero flavor and bad quality of wings.  I won't go back to this place when there's KO's right next door. It's not as nice as loco but the food has flavor and is actually good."}
{"text":"Why are there no half stars. It took an hour for the waitress to get us a beer. Horrible service. Food was ok though."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I know a few of the people at Loco and have hung out there from time to time due to the awesome patio, location and crowd in general, but I was never a huge fan of the food, always thought it was so so. That all changed last night when I deviated from my normal Taco Tues spot and tried Loco's. These were seriously some of the best tacos I have ever had, the pork, the mahi, the chicken, all awesome! My new favorite Taco Tues place! As well, they have added more taps and more craft beers so its even more of what I love! Thanks Loco!"}
{"text":"Being from LA for the last 16 years I've grown a definite craving for great crunchy tacos, not that crappy flour soft shell from t bell for me. Here you'll find the Best Crunchy Tacos in all of Old Town! I think they've even won some awards for it. Plus the Blackberry Mojito or margarita is amazing!  The Crunchy tacos -  shredded pork, beef or chicken - are the best ever tacos! All good meat-no weird tendons, parts or lumps of strange grisly fat. Nice slice of avocado with some salsa and it's perfection in a shell. Plus it's a Green Bay Packer and Bucky Badger bar - so you can never go wrong with fellow Wisconsinites!  Lots of seating inside and out, killer Queso dip and low cost, but super yummy, bottomless chips and salsa. With friend or family or even on my own this place is fabulous. Thanks for Taco Tuesday's ;)"}
{"text":"Fucking potential but They don't even microwave the flour tortillas or fry the corn tortillas. Weird to stop there with such delicious ingredients. Love the location!!!"}
{"text":"Gone here today during one of the biggest sporting events in Phoenix and all that was on the TV was basketball. You would think that a bar that prides itself on Mexico as a business would be showing copa america games when Mexico are playing. Last time inside the door of here for sure."}
{"text":"Blah.  This place bores the shit out of me and every time I go, I get more annoyed that I just spent an hour of my life there.  Its never by choice, obviously the Patron has a few faithful fans but I have yet to find the fun at Loco.  Next door to My Big Fat Greek Restaurant right on Scottsdale Rd, this patio is usually pretty packed.  Which adds to my frustration.  Everyone is smooshed onto this gated in patio, talking about how much they hate the bar.  What, like there arent a dozen other places to go to within 20 feet?  The bar took forever with our drinks and I felt like the bartenders were talking trash about patrons.  Youre not cooler than us except for the fact that youre making money at this dump instead of spending it.    Speaking of drinks, I havent ever had a great one (read: \"great\"=strong) and prices are just like every other place like this.  Food is mediocre and I usually try not to eat just so everyone can tell how much I dispise it here.    Never have I met someone fun or worth knowing here, and since I can make friends with a doorknob, this is a serious statement.  Happy Hour?  Dinner?  People watching?  Youre Loco."}
{"text":"I should have listened to the reviews about this place. Used doordash and they sent me my cheese crisp with none of the sides. Why indicate that their Cheese Crisp is a \"handmade crispy flour tortilla toasted with a blend of Mexican cheeses and green chilis, served with homemade salsa\" when you have no intent of serving it with said salsa? (Appears they often skimp on sides according to the reviews)"}
{"text":"Awful server. Happy hour. Not crowded. 4 waters for 2 of us. Messed up my drink order. Only checked back 2x. Took forever to get check and come back to take payment. Had to buy extra shot to put in margarita. Happy hour margaritas are so weak. Food is good"}
{"text":"This place has low stars but in all honesty its not bad. 3 dollars dos x all the time sounds good to me. As a avid train rider, it literally drops you off at there door. Tons of monitors to watch NFL and they have golden tee.Service was kinda crappy and there was a despute over the bill but the manager worked it out."}
{"text":"I ordered the Hangover burrito without Carne Asada to go, and I got tons of Carne Asada. The food was good but I had to pick through the burrito to eat it. Slightly disappointed."}
{"text":"Yes, get the salt and pepper wings! Beer and great tasting wings at a decent price. Why not?! The atmosphere and location of this spot was great. It's a good place to be if you're looking for a good time to hang out or want something to eat."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here but I've met up with friends a few times to grab some drinks.  This would have been my scene at 21 but I'm a little bit older and it's just not really my style anymore.  The place is really crowded, finding a place to sit is almost impossible and getting a bar tenders attention for a drink is even harder.  Their drinks are good but the place is so loud you can't hear the person next to you speak.  At least that's how it's been when I've gone on Saturday nights.  Not really sure how it is the other days of the week, maybe it's more relaxed then."}
{"text":"Weak Mexican food. Along the lines of Chevy's. I may be a bit biased when it comes to mexican food having grown up in SoCal, went to school in SD and now have access to the Mission in SF.    I didn't necessarily need/expect a great meal here, but this stuff was just flat out bad. I was STARVING when when I got there, ordered fish tacos and couldn't even finish them...not because I was full, they were just that bad.  The service was decent and the ambience is about what you would expect with a name like \"Loco Patron\".   Go here for beers/shots only."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Chips & Salsa paired nicely with my Sculpin IPA and Street Tacos.  Definitely worth the stop if you're in Tempe."}
{"text":"Great tacos, great salsa, and even better margaritas. Very close to campus, great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Loco Patron has long been a fixture on Scottsdale Road in Old Town Scottsdale, but I've always gone there more for the margaritas and barcrawler atmosphere than for the food. I haven't had any food at the Scottsdale location in several years, but I was highly impressed with the amazing happy hour offerings I sampled from the new Tempe location, which opened this past December on Mill Avenue right by the light rail.  Their happy hour runs from 3-7 p.m. daily and features a ton of hearty food options for very little moolah. On my recent visit there, my boyfriend and I shared tostadas ($5) and tacos ($3), which were basically the same thing, save for different cheeses -- go for the tacos with a corn tortilla and cojita cheese instead of their shredded mix, and you should be good.  We also got a cheese crisp, a steal at only $2! The food was all great and a really phenomenal value for the portion you got, too.  Plus, you get free chips and salsa with any meal, so we were definitely feeling full without spending a ton.  Besides the great food offerings, happy hour drinks are worth the visit, too, with $3 beers, wine and wells and jumbo beers starting at only $4.25. The Mill Avenue location also features a cool patio overlooking the busy street, and there's a huge bar and tons of televisions broadcasting sports throughout the venue. The service was fast and friendly, and it's nice that it's conveniently located to the light rail in case you have too many margaritas."}
{"text":"This place has great service, food, and drinks. We didn't have a long wait, were there on a Saturday night, sat outside at the bar, and met great people. I highly recommend this place. Great atmosphere and great people."}
{"text":"Add this spot to your list of places to consume multiple cold ones. Other than that, this spot is only just OK. Loco Patron is an oldie but goodie in the fact that it's been around for awhile and continues to be decent. It's straight across the board decent, which isn't necessarily bad. Do they have decent food? Yes. Do they have decent drinks? Yes. Do they have a decent crowd? On occasion.   If you are looking for a Taco Tuesday spot, a spot to day drink and a spot to enjoy a night out with friends, this is an option to consider."}
{"text":"For being in the heart of old town, surrounded by so many good places, my expectations were high for this place. I was very let down. I ordered takeout and to my surprise, it was nothing special. The burrito was huge and tasty but there are so many phenonmenal Mexican places I don't think I'll be back. The gorgeous bar looked good for happy hour drinks and shots though =)"}
{"text":"Okay, our 1st time here.   Happy hour was good. We had 1 of each taco and a Loco trio. The lobster tacos were awesome, rich and hearty! The ground beef soft taco was excellent. The crunchy taco, shredded beef. Way too greasy!  Sodas/iced tea  was 2.oo per glass. Overall not bad.  I would come back."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place! The best on Mill Ave is one you can get here is called the  blaster! Best food are he salt and pepper wings, cheese crisp, and grilled (healthy) chicken tenders!"}
{"text":"Asi-Asi, Menza-Menza, Comme ci Comme ca...you get the gist .  So -so ..(a solid so-so ).  Highlights:  taco's, steak salad,  and some serious drinks.   Service was  good.The atmosphere just wasn't my cup of tea. That said, i can see why some people like it here.  Drinks were solid and  the menu was decent .  Good place to get hammered I suppose.  I had a Pineapple mind eraser that was ......"}
{"text":"I ordered hot wings at a mexican joint...they were great!  My bf's burrito was huge and delicious.  Guac is great too."}
{"text":"LoCo is always a great place to go! It's one of my fave TT spots! The crunchy fish tacos are my fave along with the salt & pepper wings! All the bartenders & waiters/waitresses are prompt and very nice. They have a ton of TV's so if a game/fight is on you want to watch just ask. Nice new seating outside with a fire out. Inside can get really loud. I frequent here often with friends!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour on Friday! Their frozen margaritas are awesome! I only got to try the cheese crisp but it was good and I plan on going back!"}
{"text":"I go to Loco Patron every Friday with my friends. They have the best happy hour and their queso dip is to die for!"}
{"text":"why do i still order margaritas from here, knowing full well they are 50% insanely sweet, sugary, yucky pre-mix? yes, i did. it was cinco de mayo. i was trying to be festive. my margarita was terrible. 2 other girls beside me at the bar said the same thing. they tried to get new ones....i didn't bother because the bartender seemed highly irritated to be working.   but it's still a good, go to bar. the food is decent when we've eaten here, but i have to stay away from the margaritas dammit!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The shredded beef taco was so bland, as well as the small smothered burrito. The taco was nearly tasteless. The burrito had a bit more flavor but not much. I felt like asking if the cooks left out the sauce, or something. I've never had a bland taco  before. Filiberto's has better tacos.  The atmosphere was fun, though."}
{"text":"Likes- *Seems like they always have a spot outside (where others are packed to the max) *Can bring your dogs with you to hang out on the patio *Happy hour everyday 3PM-7PM with great drink and bar food options *Prices besides happy hour are not that bad either *Free chips and salsa-Very light salsa and fresh, which tastes amazing! *TVs to watch the games on (husband loves that one) *Waitress/Bartenders are always smiley and nice  Dislikes-   *Smells like stale beer and smoke very bad on the inside. Kind of a divey bar feel. *Allow you to smoke on the patio, which is disgusting YUCK! I always have someone that has their cigarette pointed away from them (to me) or holding behind them (to me). Hey its your cigarette you smell it right? It seems weird, because the patio is partially covered with the bar and Arizona law is 20 ft. from the building. I don't understand how they allow people to smoke at the bar or so close to it, when you 10 feet to the other side of the bar inside. *No parking assigned to Loco Patron! Do NOT park in the flag store parking or near, you will get towed. Heard horror stories on people trying to get your car back. Park on the road or try and find a spot in the garage. Its tough when its nice out and people are in old town or anything is going on. Prepare to look a while. BUT when its nice out, who cares, its good exercise and walk off those carbs ;) *You always get the drunkest and loudest people there haha! Its like people from all over kicked out go to Loco and they let them in! The music is blasting as well, which is fun most of the time.  Faves on menu-  App on happy hour-Cheese Crisp $3.00 Marinated Grilled Chicken Salad- $9.00  and of course Chips and Salsa = Free!   All in all its worth it to give it a shot. What do you have to lose? :)"}
{"text":"Love to sit at outside bar. Staff very nice and helpful and fish tacos are yummy and carne asada is BEST EVER."}
{"text":"Best place ever, the salt and pepper wings are a must!!! The environment over here is very nice and clean, the servers are very friendly and awesome, I recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Omg I can't wait to go back!!! I got the burrito and it was amazing!!! We weren't even gonna come here for lunch but just ended up coming here and it was literally the best thing I had my entire trip! Such a fun place and they even let my cousin charge his phone! Only 4 stars cause the service could have been better and there was a bee stalking our table which I get you can't do much about but maybe put those repellent things so it doesn't happen."}
{"text":"While searching for a place for some drinks and appetizers in Scottsdale the other night, some friends and I decided to pay Loco Patron a visit mostly due to their spacious outdoor seating. In all, while not the best experience, the time was enjoyable.  Star 1 - How was the service and atmosphere?  After seating ourselves, my party was promptly met by a friendly server who brought out our drinks before taking our orders for several platters of appetizers.  Outside of being just the right amount of attentive, the atmosphere at Loco Patron was comfortable, with a diverse crowd of 30-somethings and a friendly vibe. Star Granted.  Star 2 - How were the portions relative to the cost?  Admittedly, and possibly for the first time ever, I didn't keep track of the costs of our drinks and appetizers, but we did take advantage of the Happy Hour menu that consisted of fried goodies and decent drink specials.  At the end of the day, after ordering a huge plate of nachos, smashed potatoes, hot wings, a quesadilla, roughly six (weak) margaritas and four beers, our final tab for our party of six was roughly $125 after tax and tip. While I suppose $21 is a bit steep for a sampling or two of each of the appetizers and two drinks each, it wasn't unreasonable. Star Granted.  Stars 3/4 - How was the food?  While I can't speak for the normal menu, Loco Patron's Happy Hour menu was satisfying, and particular compliments go out to the hot wings and the generous portion of nachos. As is common, this isn't anything fancy, but if you're looking for a quick appetizer, Loco isn't a bad option. Single Star Granted.  Star 5 - Would you eat it every day if you could?  Would I come back again? Sure, especially since Loco Patron is very accommodating for larger crowds; however, with so many options in the area, I can't say I'd make Loco Patron a regular spot. No Star Granted."}
{"text":"Can't say enough how great this establishment is. Chips are light and crisp, salsa is fresh and tasty. Pablano enchiladas are very good with plump chichens ans creamy cheese pepper sauce. House margarita is very good not sweet with fresh juice. Wish the north Scottsdale location had same menu and chips and salsa! Ariba!!"}
{"text":"Sat at bar. Ambience fun. Outdoors. Only one choice of margarita, not good. Tacos mediocre. Service very slow. I had talked my wife in coming. Never again."}
{"text":"Such a fun night at Loco! Laser & all the boys behind the bar were so nice & helpful & made this such a fun night for me and my friends! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"For lunch they've got some pretty good food and I've been there a few times now with local businesses for meetings.  Chips and Salsa are really good (and yes that matters) and the taco's I had today (grnd beef) were really good, not greasy and everything was filling and appropriately priced.  Nightlife... typical Scottsdale bar, not much more to say.  Decent patio for hanging out, but typical scottsdale croud.. no surprises there.  But good place to hang at night."}
{"text":"Good sports-bar decor with lots of TVs and large bar.  Food is good, service is better.  Never had an issue with any of the waitstaff but the service from Kayla is the best.  Food portions are over-sized.  Impossible to leave hungry."}
{"text":"Great food. Even better happy hour. The fish tacos are to die for.  The bartender sucks though. I ordered my tacos with no salsa and no tomatoes and was told that the salsa isn't that hot anyway. I repeated that I would like no salsa or tomatoes on the tacos.  Ultimately, I spent my meal picking tomatoes out of delicious fish tacos."}
{"text":"Waiting here with a big group of people,  maybe around 10 to 15 people around 7 p.m. on a weekday. Waitress was pretty quick, in terms of getting the food down. She took a bit longer with getting the drink orders down. The place was definitely busier as time went on. We only had the one waitress for the whole night.  Price And Food: So I went on a Taco Tuesday. They had tacos and the $2 and $3 range. I tried the shredded beef and shredded chicken tacos which were both $2 each. I also have the crunchy fish taco which was $3. They only gave one lime on the side, but you could ask for more. Both the shredded beef and chicken tacos were just average. They both want anything that was too special. However, the crunchy fish taco was pretty decent. There's a type of dressing that they put on top that gives it more of a flavor.  We definitely recommend trying the crunchy fish taco. However, maybe try something else besides the beef and chicken taco. I did not get to try the other types of tacos that they had, but they still had a few more in the $2 and $3 range.  There were also maybe two or three drinks that were on the taco Tuesday drink menu special, for around 4 to $5.   Atmosphere: Inside is pretty big and spacious. They have some booths along the wall. There's some back seating. There's seating around the bar. Main thing to note: there's a DJ playing extremely Loud EDM Music You may or may not like that. I was fine with the music, but they could turn down the volume a little bit.  Parking: There's meter parking along Mill Avenue. There's also a parking garage somewhere in the back, which is supposed to be free after 5:30. I did not use it but somebody else did.  Overall, if you want to try to Tacos here, definitely come on on Tuesday for the specials. Tacos were okay but nothing too special. Would definitely still recommend trying other places, if you're still looking for your taco place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Kind of an upscale college dive bar.  I like lunches during the business week here.  We bring the office and have fun.  The bar tenders and waitresses don't let the fact that it's 11:00 AM on a Tuesday stop the party either - they are having fun and helping the party along while keeping us on time to get back to the office.  Food is well prepared and fresh."}
{"text":"I went there on a lunch date with my work bestie! And it was ok.. Nachos and salsa while we decided on what to eat . The margarita was great tacos ok. I would go back in a pinch. I love the location!"}
{"text":"There are two things I really like about Loco Patron: First, I adore the grilled chicken skewers.  They are the best thing in old town for when I am trying to be healthy but still want to go out for happy hour.  I have ordered them dozens of times and they always taste good. Second, when I am bombed, for some reason I am totally drawn to their nachos.  They are the bestest thing ever when I've had a few too many and I will leave other bars to go to Loco just to nosh on them.  Other than that, the service is generally fine but can be spotty, the crowd is a little too douchey for me some days, but it's all A-OK in my book.  You will likely have a pretty good time there!"}
{"text":"Nothing too crazy here from what I see.  I gather it can however, get a tad bit wild during the weekends and especially around ASU.    Overall, food was okay at best.  The salsa that came with the chips had too much lime.  Tasted like lime juice and the chips were store bought.    I ordered the crunchy fish tacos.  Crunchy indeed it was, but again what's up with the lime.  I added a little bit on my tacos and again it was too much.  The guacamole sauce atop wasn't bad, but my tacos were overly seasoned already.  The crunchiness was there along with the cabbage mellowing it out; that was a nice welcome.  The rice and beans were out of a can as expected.  In the end, probably come for drinks but that's about it. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A nice little spot to hang out, people watch, and enjoy some pretty average Mexican food.   Scenery-wise, good. Nicely decorated/themed, with a fun patio, perfect for late night eats. The server seemed nice enough. And the food, not bad. I've had better Mexican here in the valley, and for their Sizzlin' Fajitas being the advertised plate as you pass by and the one the server recommended, I was hoping for a little more meat with it (for the price), but okay...we're in Scottsdale afterall.   Not a bad experience overall. Fun place, good service, decent food."}
{"text":"I'd say Loco Patron itself isn't a bad establishment, in fact I used to eat at the Old Town Scottsdale location all the time when I worked right by there. The food isn't bad and the drinks are pretty decent. All in all I haven't had a bad experience there until last Saturday.  See, I enjoy the crunchy fish tacos. While some may day it's a risky move at a diveyer establishment, I'm a rebel I suppose. This last meal did prove my idiocy though because I spent the next day and a half in a sickened stupor, waking up every hour to go yak the food back up. I didn't get over it until I chugged some pepto and went back to bed. 2 stars for good ambiance and memories, but for putting me out of commission for the remainder of a weekend, I really will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Always a consistent stop for me when I'm in the area. I just like to get a drink at the bar and maybe some queso dip. The service is always friendly and attentive and the limited menu items I've chosen have been awesome. I mostly come to hang for a while while enjoying some margaritas and Mexican food! The jalapeño mango marg can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Doesn't really fit the mill scene. Decent for happy hour or chips and salsa. Lotta fohawks in this joint."}
{"text":"If you need a server.... you can find just about all of them sitting at the bar playing around on their phones.   We had the pleasure of having Sierra as our server- whose attitude was just about as piss poor as her service. I ordered a tostada/taco lunch special, so you can imagine my surprise  when a taco and some other slop was placed in front of me. Sierra advised me the mystery item was in fact an enchilada. Ah... it's Mexican food right? Just the same shit put together  slightly different. I told her not to worry, I'd eat it anyway.  I wouldn't have mind as much... but then she proceeded to argue with me that I was wrong because when she took my order she asked me for red or green sauce. \"Enchiladas are the only item that come with sauce\".    Not enough energy to argue with her, she immediately made her way back to the barstool where her phone was again glued to her hand. After about 15 minutes  of having dirty plates just sitting in front  of us, I thought I would do her a favor, head up to the bar with my card and pay. No use in staying  there any longer nor ever coming back. For better food and service I'll visit the Filibertos drive thru across the street."}
{"text":"I am a college student and this is my go-to place on mill. Super friendly staff and not to mention delicious food!!"}
{"text":"Tacos were amazing, margarita and service not so much.  We had to ask for chips and salsa, tables around us were getting it brought to them practically as soon as they sat down, we ended up never even getting them, maybe becasuse our tacos came out?! Margarita tasted like salt water. We saw our server, maybe twice? Might try again but definitely with hopes of different server."}
{"text":"Nachos were surprisingly delicious, one of if not the best ever.  FYI I'm a nacho freak, LP you win me over as a customer."}
{"text":"Regularly lie about their happy hour on their website to attract customers. Multiple incidents of this. Says 7 PM but ends at 6 PM says starts on the weekends at 930 PM but there is no happy hour at all on the weekend."}
{"text":"The very best is the shrimp enchiladas with jalapeño cream cheese sauce made with flour tortillas"}
{"text":"We went here once because our usual Sunday place was crowded. My tacos were okay, but they completely screwed up my boyfriends order. Their margaritas were pretty substandard which was disappointing. Needless to say, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Close to my house so I can walk home after drinking away night with friends.  The food is ok.  Nothing to write home about.  There's not a lot of bars open in my neighborhood.  On a second note the food isn't that good, but in a pinch it is something to eat."}
{"text":"Original visit 12/29/13 - Revised 12/31/13 - yeah, you're welcome.  Stopped by for football and beer... $3.00 Dos drafts all day, every day. Can't beat that!   Just got the bill and apparently they are actually $4.00. I politely pointed out that the poster clearly stated 'all day, every day'.   I was totally being friendly and honestly wouldn't have cared if I had to pay a couple extra dollars but the waitress was snotty and rudely explained that it was a busy weekend and \"you know, we raise prices when we're busy. Really!?   Having managed restaurants myself, I get that, but you're seriously going to TELL customers that? She then explained \"it's in the computer that way and you can talk to the Manager if you want\".   Again, arguing over a couple dollars is not my style but after being talked to like I was an annoying cheapskate, I said yes, please, send the Manager over.   The Manager came over and explained that sometimes their vendors put up posters and they weren't aware of it but that he would have them taken down.   Whatever... I hate taking this much time to write a review. Especially a bad one. I prefer to be positive.   Bottom line, I am now the proud owner of a cool 'most interesting man in the world' poster and I really shouldn't have expected a 20 year old to be able to explain the pricing discrepancy any better.  The Manager handled the situation well and I appreciated it.   Taylor, our second waitress, was fantastic!"}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star, I would.   Came here on Taco Tuesday. Sat at a \"barrel\" table. A sharp metal part of the barrel not only stabbed my leg, but ripped my jeans. The server, who happened to be the \"manager\" initially condescendingly pacified me by saying, \"sorry sweetie.\" Umm... First of all, you need to fix the problem, so no one else gets hurt. After asking about seeing a manager, his tune changed and he wanted to know the problem, when I explained he needed to fix the sharp edge and not pacify me, he came back with duct tape and said he'd take care of my tab. That's great, but my tab was WAY LESS than the coat of my jeans.   The service was terrible. The tacos were the worst I've ever had. Hardly any meat, mostly lettuce and tortilla.   Needless to say-- I won't be back. I recommend going to Native, in the same parking lot, on the same night for wing night."}
{"text":"I love the fact that HH prices are really cheap and the food was decent. I got HH tacos, a margarita and split a cookie dessert with tip and was under $15. Not bad! The ambience reminds me of San Felipe's and Salty Senorita. My friend and I sat outside and was a little loud with all the noise from Mill and the planes coming down. It has a really nice bar though with tv's that can be watched inside and outside. I can see this place popping for night life because when we went for HH, it wasn't very busy. Service was also a bit slow, I remember commenting to my friend about how long it took for us to receive our food. All in all I was glad to have tried it and would probably return."}
{"text":"This place smells like vomit. The one beer I had was cheap enough that I couldn't give it one star, but my nose was assaulted the whole time.   Disclaimer: I didn't try any food."}
{"text":"Patrons that go to this dive are Loco! I had expectations that night time hangouts in Ahwatukee would have at least a minimal amount of quality due to its yuppie reputation. I was so wrong on the expectations!  I didn't go to LP for the food, which was lucky because nothing I saw on tables looked the least bit appetizing. This place would fail a health inspection because it's filthy!  I went there to listen to a live band, and to drink and dance. That was a bad idea, although the band that played there was respectable.   The dance floor is pitiful. It's a dinky old cement floor that probably hasn't had a coat of paint for 10 years. It only shines because of the dried beer and stale grease that covers the dance floor and most of the rest of the areas. I assume people come here to watch ESPN and get drunk because it would be miserable to attempt to dance there.  The live bands get to play on an OK elevated stage that has a wood floor. The positioning of the stage would suggest that music and dance was an afterthought. Why couldn't they have used to the wood on the stage to build a floor that people could dance on? Duh!!!  Apparently people in the city of Ahwatukee have very low standards because this dive seems to get plenty of business."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the atmosphere at Loco Patron Tempe! Staff is always friendly and food is always good.. not to mention the Mango Jalapeño Margarita!!! My go to meal is the chicken poblano enchiladas with black beans and the house smashed potatoes with ceviche to start things off!"}
{"text":"Food was actually pretty good. I'm not a connoisseur of street tacos by any means, but this was one of the better lobster tacos I've had.   The ambience of the place left a lot to be desired though. There was like this gigantic speaker pumping out music right next to our table. To be honest, it didn't get better when we moved tables. The whole place was like a Great White concert. No chance for conversation and the beer prices are crazy even for Scottsdale.   Would not recommend as there are way better places to eat a taco in peace in the city."}
{"text":"I came here for taco Tuesday last week and had a great time and a great meal! We got there around 7pm and snagged a table on the patio but it was getting busy. Our waitress was attentive without being overbearing (much appreciated!), and the fish tacos were amazing!! The prices are great for both tacos and drinks, I would love to make taco Tuesday here a weekly tradition! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Best Patio! Great Food! Cold Beer. All the best Sports."}
{"text":"Stopped in last Friday night around 8. Ordered four Corona Lights on a lark. I am not going to say that they were warm but they were far from acceptably cold.. Sat at a bar table for twenty minutes that was never cleaned off from the last group to include two tips from past parties just lying there. Two stars just because bars in Scottsdale never totally suck... you are in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Very good spot for being so far back in Ahwatukee.  It's very casual but has a good beer selection and although the Mexican food is hit and miss, their wings are really good and Taco Tuesday is a big hit.  It's a good place to socialize with locals or go alone and read a book.  The longtime staff is also very friendly.  I recommend."}
{"text":"Loco Patrõn is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley. When I first tried Loco Patrõn I wasn't expecting it to be great, I figured it would be typical bar food. But I was blown away by how delicious the food was! The presentation is fabulous and the service is always prompt. It is a great place to take your friends or family. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Favorite place on mill hands down! Food is awesome! My favorite is the grilled chicken tenders. The drink specials are awesome! Frozen mango Margs are my go to. The stuff is really friendly! I love all of them"}
{"text":"Delicous Mexican food and very easy online ordering. Their Baja burrito is delicious without being too spicy. Don't forget to try their waffle fries. They are killer. The bar itself is really nice and open with large tv's to watch the games. I usually order through ubereats! To get $10 of your order use my code eats-mbdvx."}
{"text":"I visit this location often. Mainly due to the close proximity to my work office during lunch. Most days I find service to be prompt and food to be spot on. I do wish you had a taco Tuesday deal for those of us that have to grab and run due to our lunch schedule.  You definitely would get a lot more of our office's business. Anyways, keep up the great job on CS. The waitstaff is doing an outstanding job."}
{"text":"I come with my daughter and her friend on Taco Tuesday's.  I was hungry today so I did not take any pictures.  Sorry but you have to come and try this place."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and only had a couple of drinks. The bar service was excellent. We observed the manager making good on an incorrect food order, offering to make it right. Really good service. We will be back."}
{"text":"We looked around for a bit in Scottsdale, and finally stopped in here. The outdoor seating is lovely, and we couldn't have been happier with the food. I highly recommend the enchilada!! It is great with either green or red sauce! The only down side was that the pico de gallo in my tostada was a bit moldy, but they made another one, and took it off the bill! Great experience."}
{"text":"Came here on taco Tuesday. Not impressed at all. Margaritas were good, I will give them that. Located in old town so that atmosphere is really cool. Has outdoor seating with misters. Inside there is plenty of seating, TV's and shuffle board! There are waaaay better Mexican places in the valley than this."}
{"text":"Way too many tables. No room to even get OUT once you're seated. Constantly being bumped into. All tables were dirty when we went to seat ourselves. Waitresses were very fast to run away, but extremely SLOW at bringing out food. Food was mediocre.  Don't go here expecting good Mexican food. It's cheap bar version of...something resembling Mexican food. Go for drinks, maybe appetizers, and watch a game. If you want good food  (or service), go elsewhere. Oh...went to order spicy coleslaw as a side and was told they were out. Well, do you need me to run to Walmart and get you more cabbage? MAKE SOME MORE. Let me just choose some tasteless refried beans instead, thank you. Ugh. I would label this as the Buffalo Wild Wings of Mexican food. Take that how you want.  Sigh."}
{"text":"IT'S PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!!! PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!!! PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!!! PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!!!  IT'S PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!!! PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!!!

This is what I expect most of the douchenozzles and their accompanying dirty vagina'ed amigas have on an endless, thousand-decibel-loop inside their pea-brains as they lean like euro-cholos here at Loco Patron, never really acknowledging each other until the battle call \"JAGERSHOTS JAGERSHOTS JAGERSHOTS\" , is signaled to the witless congregation, first as a question, then as an affirming statement, and finally a rallying yell, like a slow-clap-progression in a John Hughes movie.  If this is you, take your hand and slap some sense into yourself ... you are annoying the piss out of me as I stand there drinking my shitty beer in a crappy version of Mexican Chili's.    I've been to a ton of lame bars [ha! \"bar\" ... its a restaurant, tools] around these parts and those parts, and boy-o, this one sweeps the major categories.  Food: Garbage Crowd: Warped Service: Autistic Atmosphere: Kill Me Overall Experience: Al-Qaeda"}
{"text":"We had a fun time here. Great to watch sports as they have a ton of TVs with every sport possible. The plates, cutlery and entire place could use a good clean! Went during happy hour ordered a few appys and all tasted great. I also got the baked cookie with ice cream which was a great desert to share. Nothing fancy at all but tasty! Service was good and drinks were reasonable. Again the only issue I had was the cleanliness!!"}
{"text":"Sat out on the patio during spring training time...It was packed and a lot of fun.  We had the fajitas and I thought they were pretty good.  The service was so-so, but it was busy.  Cool place to hang out with friends - very casual."}
{"text":"Spent the evening here for the ASU/UofA game. Couldn't have been happier. Great atmosphere, service and food. I spend a lot of time at the Scottsdale location, and while there is a different vibe, I think it's a perfect fit for the Mill Ave college crowd."}
{"text":"Went back to Loco Patron last night.  My husband had to have the Salt and Pepper Wings!  Even though it is a 42 mile one way trip to the place.  For a Wednesday night, they had a lot of things going.  The hockey and basketball games were on TV and Wednesday nights is their poker tournament events.  There was a steady flow of people for the time we were there.  Even with all the activities our service was still GREAT!  Seth ROCKS!  Ok down to the good stuff - FOOD review:  Salt and Pepper Wings served with carrots, celery and chipotle ranch dressing - The wings were fried to a golden perfection.  The wings were cooked through & through but still juicy and full of the simple balance of salt and pepper.  Baked Mac & Cheese with grilled chicken breast - Spiral macaroni cheesed out with a creamy comb of smoked provolone and cheddar jack.  It is topped with toasted bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.  The grilled chicken was still juicy not dry.  The combination of the cheese and the toasted bread crumbs was so cheesy and GOOD.  Hubby had the loco soft tacos with the shredded pork and told me that they tacos were just RE-DONK-U-LIOUS.  I am not sure if that is a word but OK we will go with that.  Next time I need to save room for dessert.  The Sopapilla and ice cream has been calling my name."}
{"text":"Loved the food.  Very fresh take in Mexican food.  Loved the lobster fajitas chips and homemade tortillas.  Salsa was really bad and waitresses were very unengaging."}
{"text":"Got a Breakfast burrito from here which was freakin awesome, and the chips and salsa were great too. Good prices. Sat on the patio and really enjoyed it. I forgot what drink I had but i think it was some beer and tequila mix which I really enjoyed. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not too shabby, the wings are good, tacos meh, salsa is gross in my opinion..  Drinks are pretty good and cheap during happy hour. I would come back for the drinks."}
{"text":"After an impromptu happy hour organized by none other than Georgie S I feel I need to write a review. There were fellow Yelpers and non-Yelpers alike. Everyone had a grand time. How can you not when there are $1/$2 tacos, $4 nachos, and $2 Dos Lager on draft?!   I had the Mahi Mahi tacos on corn tortillas, which were $2. Plus 6ish Dos Equis. All for $35 including tip. Not too bad I thought. Our server was a little on the slow side, but we were having a good time and didn't mind too much. I tried the nachos and they were decent and for $4 nicely sized. We were sitting on the patio on a great early evening/night. Normally Tuesday nights are reserved for hockey, but being in between seasons a little HH was just what the doctor ordered. This night turned into an adventure with a drunken trip to the Grapevine. Solid!"}
{"text":"The owners are very friendly and always looking to contribute to the community! Also the free chips and salsa is great and the restaurant has a good atmosphere. I love the Mac n cheese"}
{"text":"Great margaritas and the green chile quesadilla was amazing! We ordered chips and guacamole and was satisfied with taste!! The overall food was very fresh and filling!! Customer service was exceptional and friendly! We loved the laid back casual feel! We will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Why have a jukebox that customers can't enjoy.  Makes absolutely no sense in having the sound default to your \"playlist\" and blocking its use."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican I have had since coming to Scottsdale. Great sports, great atmosphere and did I mention I had the best server!! Definitely stop in and give these guys a try we loved their tortillas soup and they're amazing tacos !!"}
{"text":"Had some food and drinks here after work. Service was good, drinks tasted great, and the food was really delicious. Had the enchiladas and some blue moon beer, they were great! Good place to relax and wind down during the week."}
{"text":"I work right behind Loco and every Friday, if not more often, me and a group of coworkers go for lunch. They have great lunch specials and great food. Everyone who works there is also great. Would recommend for a good lunch time or happy hour spot."}
{"text":"Had it delivered thru grub hub.  Good was great. Still hot.  Shredded smothered beef burro was really good and the guac was good. Wouldn't put onions in it. But that's me."}
{"text":"This is actually my friends & my favorite place in town. Even when I was living on the east coast I would still come to this place every time I came to visit! The bar/ waitstaff are always so great and  are very accommodating/ patient rockstars. The food is great, I think I've tried almost everything on the menu (for starters, get the trio). They have a great beer (they have this amazing Mother Earth Cali creamin ale on draft right now) and spirit selection. It's really convenient too, usually ample parking across the street and it's right on the light rail!! Dj Matt in the Hat is also there every Tuesday so you have to check out their awesome taco Tuesday specials!"}
{"text":"They gave my uber eats order to another courier.  Waited an hour for food that wouldn't show up, then Spent 15 mins on the phone with Uber eats before they told me what actually happened.  Enough said."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here on November 23rd to celebrate my 21st birthday. Boy are we glad we did. After being at two other bars, prior to this one, we weren't finding \"that spot\" until we walked in here. The drinks are good and very good priced, the waitress we had was great, and all of the bouncers were really cool, and this was a great spot to watch ASU beat UCLA. Not too busy either. The food was bar none, Enchiladas, rice and beans, as good as it gets!!! Next time we go bar hopping in old town, this will be a definite stop!!"}
{"text":"Fun ! Great place for tacos and happy hour !!"}
{"text":"Great little place happy hour prices are awesome. Good food great relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to do tequila shots, this is not the place, as they are stingy with their booze...That was 100% sarcasm.  The Patron shots are LITERALLY 3 shots in one.  Also just recently noticed that they have a Nintendo Wii set up--drunken bowling anyone?"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning because everywhere else had super crazy wait times! Overall, it wasn't a bad experience. Food wasn't terrible, but I wasn't blown away by it either. We had a group and got 2 mimosa buckets which were nice! They came with a variety of juices to choose from. Our waitress was great! Even though this wasn't the best Mexican food I've ever had, I'd definitely go back to try out lunch/dinner and see how their ritas are!"}
{"text":"Swung by here for drinks after work with friends.  We were amazed at how many people were here on a Tuesday night.  The place was busy.  The music is loud, which is perfect for the atmosphere and vibe here.  Since we already had dinner, we were only here for cold Beer.  I had a Dos XX Lager and the rest of the group had Heineken.  Service here was so/so.  Our server started out well by getting us our drinks right away, but she wasn't too attentive as the night went on....we had to flag her down whenever we needed a refill.  Although we weren't eating, we received complimentary Chips & Salsa....they were average.  The Salsa is very mild, no kick to it at all...what I like to call, Tomato Sauce Salsa.  I'll have to come back and try the food.  Return Factor - 70%"}
{"text":"This was the number one worst food I have ever had. he only thing we ordered that was edible was the queso. The waitress had virtually no personality. When she asked how the food was and we told her the chimi was horrible, her response was \"are you ready for your check?\"   The chimi was to be shredded beef, but they brought me ground beef. I thought that since the waitress had completely vanished during our meal, I would try it. It had absolutely no seasoning. It was a flavorless tortilla wrapped around unseasoned ground beef. There was nothing else in it, including any hint of seasoning. I tried adding the rice, salsa, and queso, but nothing helped. My husband who can eat anything, could not eat this!  My son got a cheeseburger. It was dry and had no condiments. Of course we would have asked for some mayo if the waitress had ever come back. Since our drinks were empty, there was nothing with which he could choke the dry burger down.   The men in my home are big eaters. Nobody finished anything, There was more food left than eaten. The waitress's complete indifference to the fact we were unsatisfied topped off the worst food experience we have ever had. We will never come back and will let everyone we know it is not worth the drive, let alone the money they would have to spend on over-priced food prepared and served by the most worthless staff I have ever encountered."}
{"text":"I am absolutely astounded that this \"Mexican Restaurant\" has 3 and 1/2 stars on yelp! The only reason why they get a star from me is the bar atmosphere, they have a great bar with good happy hour deals, but that's it.   Lets begin with the food, salsa and chips...absolute crap. The salsa tastes like canned crap from a 99 cents store, bland and just CRAP, I can go to Filiberto's across the street and find salsa 10 times better than what's at Loco's. The chips are salty as h***, tastes as if they poured the entire salt shaker into the basket, VERY SALTY, i'm not a goat, but thanks! I've been here for plenty of taco Tuesdays (mainly for the drinks). The tacos run between 1-2 bucks. The dollar tacos are shredded chicken or beef and the 2 dollar ones are shrimp, mahi mahi, and new york steak.I've tried all of the tacos, the shredded chicken and beef always dry and bland, same with the mahi mahi! The only tolerable tacos are the shrimp and new york steak, but once you go to a REAL Mexican restaurant, it makes those tacos look like poop! I've had their chimichanga's, again like another poster said about the beef, they put ground beef instead of shredded like what I expected and it sucked! I refuse to try anything from there again! If I go here it's only for happy hour once in a blue moon, but that's about it. Want to go to a real Mexican Restaurant try Los Taquitos off of 48th st and Elliot and La Canasta in Downtown, those are real Mexican restaurants.   You know there is something wrong with a \"Mexican Restaurant\" when the hamburgers are better than the \"Mexican food\" they serve. Nuff said."}
{"text":"I really need to start of list for Mill Ave.  Professionals looking for a good happy hour  on Mill Ave.  I totally love when a new place opens up because I have a fantastic workgroup that I can't wait to try your place out.    With that said, we walked ALL the way from University...huff, puff, huffying..to the north side of Mill Ave. to check this new place out.  Lucky for us happy hour starts at 3pm.  Ok...we worker bees start at 5am-7am, because our counterparts are on the east coast. So, we all get off between 3pm-5pm.    Loco Patron had great HH specials.  Beers were cheap and the marg's were inexpensive.  The marg's were okay.  I am not a fan of sour drinks...they were nothing special.  Chips and salsa were comp...nice touch.  The service was okay...even at 3ish.  I really don't recall anything that made this place special, we brought such a large group and it was ok.  The place was able to accommodate our seating arrangement.  Not sure if I will come back."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour, got shredded beef tacos. Hated them. Flavorless and cheap. At least the salsa was semi decent."}
{"text":"Food wss hot, tasty and quick. Drinks somewhat expensive but good. Definitely a lot of food for cost. Really good flavors.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"Solid tex mex option in downtown Scottsdale, after an afternoon by the pool it was a great place to stop for refuel before hitting the bars, the mix and match taco options were tasty, I did the friend fish and coconut shrimp with Spanish rice and beans. Hubs did the enchilada and loved it. The margaritas were strong, the patio had misters and the server was super friendly. No complaints."}
{"text":"Completely different that the scottsdale location. The tempe spot is so much better and the bartender Ben is always a pleasure to talk to. Dom is behind the bar as well and he is a very genuine person. The tacos at loco are the best! I get crunchy pork and a strawberry mojito and I am just in paradise. Literally 5 tacos later because they are so good!"}
{"text":"This is a local bar/hangout. Its not fast or fancy, food is average...don't come hear expecting awesome. But if you're looking for casual Taco Tuesday? Here it is...beer and tacos, try the bean dip too (its not on the menu)! Service is hit and miss...some of the staff has been there a while they've got it down. Owners are cool, football season is fun. I wish there was no smoking on the patio..."}
{"text":"Crunchy pork tacos are simply the best. The fajitas are good too and you have a choice of corn or flour tortillas which is not typical for fajitas. Gluten free friendly fajitas! Good beer selection and family friendly."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and well prepared and drinks were great. I wish the patio was better kept as there was the sight of bird droppings that made us move inside. Hard to see that when you're eating. We had a good time overall !"}
{"text":"This place is a sleeper. It's mixed in along with a cluster of other clubs and bars in Old Town Scottsdale but has a very unique vibe. Lotsa tequila, which can be a very good or very bad thing, as we all know, but reasonable prices and a good inside/outside mix. People seem to always congregate inside near the bar or outside at the tables, never so much in what looks to be the dining area.   The bathrooms are pretty gnarls barkley, but with that much booze and Corona floating around that's bound to happen. Food is so/so, but the staff is always friendly and quick to help out."}
{"text":"Good service. Great outdoor seating with musters. We got the appetizer of queso, Guac, and pineapple salsa. Everything needed tons of salt but it was good. Thy charge for extra chips which is lame cause the basket is tiny and we had 6 people all eating. Waffle fries looked good but I didn't get them. I got the AZ burrito which I HIGHLY recommend. Also street cart tacos. The food was great but service was just okay for me."}
{"text":"Met with some girlfriends for breakfast here. I arrived prior to my friends and thought I had to be seated but you pick your own table which I liked. The weather was nice out so I chose a table by the large window /  open patio area. The waitress was nice and provided the complimentary chips basket and water while I waited for my friends.   There's a good breakfast selection ( the lunch menu was also available). Both my friend and I are suckers for french toast so we both ordered it while my other friend ordered the breakfast burrito. Being a French toast connoisseur, prior to ordering, I specifically asked the waitress if the french toast was made with \" thick, Texas Toast like bread\", she said yes. Well, the food came out and she placed in front of us thee most PA-THE-TIC French toast I've ever had!!! It wasn't Texas toast bread. Or brioche. Or any other thick, hearty bread typically used for French toast... It was a regular ol' booooring sandwich sliced bread. Two slices of the bread cut in half with bananas thrown on top. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. The party I was with were conservative and didn't want me to complain and so I just sucked it up. Both my friend and I ate the measly \"anorexic bread\" (as we later jokingly called it) up in all of five to six bites with a quickness and was still left hungry!!! Meanwhile, we salivated over the thiiick, full breakfast burritos our other friend was struggling to eat/finish. The burrito was monstrous sized and looked very good! I doubt I will ever go back here, at least not for breakfast, but if I do, I will avoid the French toast like the plague and go with the burrito!"}
{"text":"The Loco salad with pork red chili is amazing. Brook and Joe provided amazing service for my late dinner last night. I will be back again."}
{"text":"I like all of these places until they get way too crowded. Got to be honest.  Hate it when I am in a place and cant move.  Some people get off on that sort of thing but for me it is just time to leave.    This place is cool though.  The bar is fun, and mexican food is not bad.  Salsa is actually really good.  The salt and pepper wings are a real plus too.   Fun place to go for happy hour.   The music gets a little loud in the bar at night, but that comes with the territory."}
{"text":"By the reviews, I would more than likely never would of come here. But I was visting my best friend and his wife. And this is where they go every Friday for happy hour. Maybe because they are regulars, they get treated better, I don't know.  But our server was on point all night. The beers never got empty, I don't drink much, I only had 3 beers. The beers only came to $ 11.00.  His friends food, looked really good,  I believe a steak quesadilla. I meet 2 of the owners, they seemed very nice.  I really like when harley riders and those people in cages (vehicles) can be in the same bar. It was a great night, always is, when with my best friend."}
{"text":"Stopped by for Cinco de Mayo.  Our waitress, Christine, was fantastic.  Led us in the right direction every time for drink and food options...  Lots of beers, margaritas and tequila shots.  Hard shell beef tacos and grilled mahi mahi soft tacos with beans and rice were very tasty.  I added hot sauce to most of my food, but the average patron would have found it muy caliente the way I like it.  Good food, service and a good time..."}
{"text":"This place has a awesome outdoor seating selection so you can enjoy your amazing tacos they have. I got the crunchy fish taco and it was fire."}
{"text":"So the food here is actually pretty good we had street tacos and some tostada bites. The service however is absolutely horrific. We sat down for 20 minutes before flagging down a server to ask if they were doing table service. About 5 minutes after that a server finally came to take our order, however they came without menus. We ordered drinks and they took so long that I went to the bar and ordered a drink and finished it before the drink I ordered showed up. So if you want to wait an ungodly amount of time and be frustrated with your server for some pretty good but not spectacular food then by all means go for it, but I would suggest going next door instead to cold beer and cheeseburgers."}
{"text":"Exceptional food service is great I suggest the crunchy tacos they're delicious. The tortilla soup is the best in town and their micheladas are delish too"}
{"text":"Best Mexican  I've had in awhile.  Pork taco was so good.  Salsa and margaritas are fresh. Service was wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is always a good time... we like coming in for brunch and getting the bottomless mimosas. Justin has been our bartender the past few times, and he is always great-attentive, friendly, and helpful. I wish the mimosas went later than 1 pm but we definitely get our money's worth because the service is good. I am not a brunch food person, so I always stick with the lunch options. I love that they actually have some healthier options (tomato queso salad with avocado is my favorite) and equally love to indulge in the tacos with a side of smashed potatoes or the trio (which is now pineapple salsa, queso and guacamole-all delicious!). If I'm going to be on Mill, this is definitely where I'd go, especially during the day time/happy hour."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials.  Margaritas were decent, chips and salsa free but the food was gross. It was your typical mexican bar food nothing at all special or delicious in any way. I can see it as a place where you might end up eating only if your wasted and starving. The service was slow too even though we were a group of 6 with only 4 other people in the bar."}
{"text":"Frozen protein paradise. Basically a Taco Bell with decent booze. Weak at best for food. But a sweet outside seating section. Service was good."}
{"text":"Great stop on the way to Chase Field, It's right on the Mill Ave light rail stop. Awesome chips and salsa  and Ice cold beers, Jeromy makes the best margaritas in town! It was mid-day Sunday and the place had a great crowd. Service was great from start to finish."}
{"text":"I really liked Loco Patron! Unfortunately it was too cold (the only time I'll probably say this in Arizona) for us to use some of the outdoor games they had, but they looked really fun!  The food was really good. They have lots of vegetarian options. The atmosphere is casual with lots of TVs if you want to watch a game. Overall I had a good experience and I'll be back - but Loco Patron only gets 4 stars instead of 5 from me because the service left something to be desired. The waitress just kind of seemed like she wasn't sure where she was at or what was going on. Other than that, I give this restaurant a big thumbs up."}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed with the food. It has to be the best tacos I have ever had in AZ. The smashed potato side was so good too! I will definitely return here for the food. The service took forever when I went which I was not happy with but because of the food quality I shall be returning soon loco patron."}
{"text":"Went here and had a variety of tacos. Street tacos were by far the best, though every taco I tried was awesome.   The street tacos came with carne asada and they pretty much tasted like I had 15 cooks splashing my palette with the most amazing flavors ever created.   Get u a street taco. Hurry."}
{"text":"Yes, it does get cramped but look at the size of the bar..what do you expect?  I really wanted to give 4 stars because I have had great food experiences here but I have to agree with past posts about the crowd.   The tacos are suprisingly great and the salsa is awesome!!!  It tastes like fresh tomatoes and none of that overly onion-y and garlic flavor some salsas have.  Keep it simple!  Food comes in a timely manner.  The muscular food runner guy was quick and on top of things. We had a pretty blond server and she was really attentive even though the place was packed.  $3 domestic and mexican beer all the time is a great deal while the mixed drinks are average (little weak).  So I give this bar 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Went for taco Tuesday... quite the cluster. Poor service and very dirty. Granted, it was taco Tuesday and full of college kids. The food (tacos, chips and queso) was pretty good. Tortillas could use some help, but tasty meats."}
{"text":"THE GOOD:  While staying at the Hilton Garden Inn, Cowboy Ciao was recommended to us. However, when we arrived we saw that the patrons were all dressed up (not very cowboy) and the prices were quite high so we decided to walk around and we found Loco Patron and decided to give it a shot.  Boy am I glad we did.  We were fortunate enough to happen upon Loco Patron on a Tuesday and as other reviewers mention, this is Taco Tuesday night. $1 beef or chicken or $2 steak or fish tacos and $2 draft Mexican beers and $3 margaritas.  We each ordered three steak tacos. The meat is great, These tacos include lettuce, pico de gallo, cheese, and a guacamole sauce that has a bit of a kick to it. I ordered mine without lettuce cause that's how I roll and the tacos were excellent. I ordered a Dos Equis and Cris ordered a frozen strawberry margarita. The beer was ice cold and delicious and the margarita was one of the best I have ever tried. It was so good I ordered a second one for us to share after I finished my beer.  Our waitress was excellent and very attentive. She took good care of us.  The atmosphere is very casual and there are a dozen Best of Phoenix awards up on the wall.  The restaurant is clean and there is a large bar area. I will definitely be back to this venue.  Dinner for two with chips and salsa and alcohol was less than $20 (on Tuesday). Outstanding.  NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:  Honestly I cannot think of anything to add to this category. It was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Local joint for the students to find great happy deals and bargains on drinks/grub.   This was a very fun place, super convenient location and good ambiance."}
{"text":"Good happy hour specials. Love their skinny marg. Good patio.  I LOVE their salt and pepper wings. Their steak tacos are bomb too.  This place is always hopping on weekends. We usually start here when we go out in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Im really glad this new location opened so close to my house! Were big fans of the wings at the original Loco location, and now we dont have to go all the way to Scottsdale for them (like its far, but I digress).  This location is about twice the size (inside) of the Scottsdale location. It was clean and theres a variety of different places to sit. We chose the bar tops in the corner. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. We had our Loco staples: the salt and pepper wings (so, so good), and tacos. I actually tried the shredded pork taco this time as opposed to the steak one I usually get and I was not disappointed.  Loco has some great daily specials (taco Tues, wing Wed, etc) and their happy hour specials are great.  Im sure this will become a Mill Ave staple."}
{"text":"Loco Patron gives a big portion for a decent price. Quick service too. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We just left this place. Very disappointed.  Nachos sucked, things were to spicy and really 8 bucks for a pint of beer. Go to 4 peaks brewing"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a little Sunday Funday.. Mahi tacos were pretty good. and the Margarita beer? not sure if thats what its called but it was tastey. Good patio for a daytime snack/drink. Waitresses are a little unfreindly, but I'd still go back"}
{"text":"This place was great! Until we got the bill and were over charged.  Come to find out, things may be more expensive \"on race days.\" Weird. I didn't see that noted anywhere.  Not in the menu or on a sign anywhere near a door.  The food was fantastic, the service was tolerable for how busy it was.  Our server did hook our table up with cards that get us 10% off throughout 2014 (though the cards are labeled for 2013).    tl;dr:  Don't come on a race day! The Award Winning Crunchy Tacos are delicious! Try the Smashed Potatoes!"}
{"text":"Psst, hey Loco Patron, can you open a Loco by my house pleeeease. Like Queen Creek and Price. We'll be your first regulars!  My boyfriend and I go to K-Bella salon to get our hairs cut and while we wait for one another, we hang out at Loco which is in the same strip mall. The staff is really cool and they have great HH prices and pretty decent food. They also have lots of different tequilas to choose from."}
{"text":"Love the food .. Love the vibe. Staff is so sweet. Great outdoor seating area. They can accommodate large groups easily, which comes in handy with business lunch and dinners."}
{"text":"This place brings back memories. On Tuesdays their wings are so good. Together drink specials great place for a local get together or a pregame party on the way to now. Little bit norther off of Mill Avenue but one of the greats local spots for each pre-gaming"}
{"text":"On the douche scale of Affliction to Ed Hardy...this place falls at Skater Jersey status.  I didn't have any food so I can't comment on that, but man the atmosphere sucks.  I wouldn't have gone here on my own, but my friend told me he had a Corona Light waiting for me.  Liar!  I had to order it when I got there.  The drinks were fine...you can't really screw up a bottled beer.  But the waitresses looked like they hated life and the doorman was completely unnecessary.  Back the fuck off bro.  You don't own anything."}
{"text":"Meh - not my crowd at all.  The much younger group in the corner was super snotty and mouthy regarding my group of older coworkers (30s - 40s) as they gave us the hairy eyeball when we dared to come in and take the tables near them.  We were just looking for somewhere mellow to grab a bite and have a few drinks, and you would've thought we were there to put an end to all things joyful in the world. The food was mediocre, the drinks were syrupy sweet, and the overall vibe was trashy.  I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a run and had a bite to eat during happy hour. Quesadilla was pretty good. Smashed potatoes were really good. Not the best meal after a run but nice ambience on the patio. Pleasant staff."}
{"text":"It was ladies night last night and it fell on Taco Tuesday. Loco Patron was a huge hit. The ladies and I filled up a booth with laughter and fun without breaking the bank. From 3pm-Midnight you can score great tasting food and margarita's for an affordable price. $1.00 Tacos, $4.00 Wings in various flavors, $4.00-$5.00 Margarita's and much more. The ladies at my table enjoyed the Strawberry Margarita's at $5.00 a piece. Freshly made and brought to your right away they helped wash down our $1.00 Tacos and upgraded Steak, Fish Taco's for $2.00 bucks. Even though we were given Chips and Salsa to start our food came so quick it was quite the surprise not having to wait long for our food.   Service was great. We started at the bar and were served by a friendly bartender then we headed to a table near the DJ booth and was served by a server who was on the ball. I mentioned DJ because they have one from 7pm-Midnight. DJ Matt in the hat took our request and spin the night away.   You don't have to be a starving student to enjoy Taco Tuesdays. We were a bunch of business woman who needed a night out and it was worth every penny. Will do it again!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour in old town!!!! Make sure you try the amazing food!!! Trio of dips and food is all great!! Best service as the staff is spot on!!!"}
{"text":"This is just about the service.. The girl who was helping us (I don't know her name) long pony tail blonde extremely skinny. We came in it was a group of five and we told her we were doing separate orders by two couples and one single guy she messed up our orders after we told her exactly what to charge on what which is fine okay everyone makes a mistake but she came back around we noticed she charged us all wrong and told her to correct it and told her exactly what cards were for what and she said she understood and shed void it and again she ended up charging us for the wrong thing basically she made the same mistake 3times. Also our other friend paid in cash and she didn't even offer to give him his change back she just pocketed the money and he was going to tip either way but it's a common respect thing to give the change back plus someone so dumb does not deserve 25% tip sorry"}
{"text":"Loco is better than similar Mexican places. Loco has a generous weekday happy hour from 3-7 along with daily specials.  The beer list is decent.    The veggie wrap is really good with lots of fresh grilled veggies and their signature smashed potatoes are definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Stale.   Stale chips, stale beer (clean the hoses!), the salsa had a weird taste to it, grilled chicken strips were rubbery...   The ranch was good. It was that thousand-calorie Restaurant Ranch that you can't buy in stores. I liked that."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night for taco Tuesday and it was a lot of fun! I ordered one chicken and one fish taco and they were delicious!  They come with a unique sauce that added a lot and I also enjoyed the complimentary chips and salsa.  My favorite part of this experience, was the deal!  I ended up only paying $6 (+tip) for my beer and two tacos.  Definitely a place I would revisit when I visit Scottsdale again!"}
{"text":"I heard about the new bar and went and checked it out for dinner and a couple of beers was greeted really nice and told there's open seating at the bar so I grab a seat at the bar and was greeted by two lovely ladies Kirstyn and Erica and they would take care of me got a cold beer and when I was ready Kirstyn took my food order and and hardly any wait for it to come out and she came back to make sure I was good and food was awesome I said yes it is and they made sure I wasn't going thirsty great service and attention to me and all the people at the bar I will let my friends know about what a great time I had!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! It's right on Scottsdale Rd so it is really easy to find. 3 hour parking is all up and down the streets around it too so that is not an issue. Great place to go sit outside on a nice day and have a Corona or Pacifico with some chips & salsa. They have a good happy hour and the atmosphere is fun and summery. Their food is delicious. They have the best Mahi Mahi tacos I have ever had. When I am craving fish tacos, I go directly to Loco! I have taken many friends and family here after talking it up and all agree that the fish tacos are amazing. I have also hear the Lobster tacos are great, but have never tried them so I will have to do this. Loco Patron is great for lunch, dinner, happy hour, a place to watch a game, etc. One of my faves."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite outdoor patio in Old Town.  Fun and friendly staff.  And the Dos Equis is always cold."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and wasn't disappointed either time.  The tacos are excellent! Margaritas are pretty good.  Service is great! The food here is much better than some Mexican restaurants I've tried and I'll definitely keep coming back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We went on a Groupon. So we were forced to order a lot. We couldn't eat it all but we tried the wings, which I liked. We tried the dry rub and the Habanero. I really liked the hot ones. Despite being a self-proclaimed pepper head, they made my brow sweat a bit. The dry rub were also tasty. They were mainly drums and the flavor was good. We also had a carne asada torta which we really liked. It was beef, avocado, onions and peppers with some type of mayo on fresh torta roll. There were great beer specials and the place started filling up. with mainly college aged males, which is fine. the décor is Loco Patron style, skulls and such, we liked it. Bright and open, the patio is curbside so you can watch the tourists looking at you. Because you are drinking beer ad they are jealous, I assume The staff treated us like gold and we would go back."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive going here after reading old reviews but when I saw recent ratings trending up I wanted to see for myself.  First, the atmosphere is great.  Fun and relaxing patio and nice layout indoors.  Three of us enjoyed good drinks, appetizers and dinner.  One minor glitch was promptly taken care of and a special shout out to our server and manager Chris who made a special trip to the table to double check that we had been well taken care of....which we were.  This is a new place with minor and expected start up experiences, but the wait staff and management are clearly committed to making this a great experience for all.  Well done.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Back again. Tim's the best. Crispy fish tacos, margarita and Cafe Patron. Wonderful place."}
{"text":"Great patio and a fun place to happy hour.  Been a couple of times since it opened and the service has been really friendly.  The spicy margarita is super yummy!  For food, I really liked the corn, wings, and grilled chicken tenders.  They have options for all different types of Mexican food preferences.  Well worth it to check it out."}
{"text":"1st let me say there's 5 handful of restaurants on this strip. However, I stopped in Loco Patron because it was happy hour. Sat at the bar. The bartender shot the breeze with everyone but me. He looked like he didn't even want to be there. $5 Margaritas and $5 Nachos which was great. For the cost, guess you shouldn't expect good customer service. I'll go to Diego Pops next time where everyone looks happy and cheerful."}
{"text":"Unbelievable...11:45 at night on a Friday in Old town. NO tables inside. 15 or so people came in to drink at the bar AFTER we got our food. No check back to make sure we liked our food, supposed to be after 2 bites. I AM A SERVER. No friggin excuse...ESP when you're NOT running your butt off. Isabella...i don't know if it's because we're not drinking but this is ludicrous. Only concerned with us after the bill was dropped. 1 star because I can't leave 0. I guess if your drunk you may not notice horrible service. End rant."}
{"text":"They have breakfast!!  Went around 10am on a Saturday and there was no wait :)  they also serve there lunch and dinner menu in the morning for the once's who eat chicken enchiladas for breakfast like me!  They have a good selection to choose from. Many TVs around to keep up on the sport games! The food came at a reasonable time and it was fresh and tasty. I was not impressed with the service. When my water cup sits empty for over 15 min I'm not happy. Food 5 stars! Service 3 :/"}
{"text":"Amazing service here all the time! All the bartenders are amazing and the food is phenomenal. I would recommend the nachos with queso! And have Ben whip you up a cactus pear margarita."}
{"text":"In the midst of tourist-Town, this is a nice surprise.  Happy hour is a good one.  Small portions on apps but the quality is present.  The well concocted and presented buffalo cauliflower is a must try, especially if spicy is your thing.  The prickly pear margarita with spicy salt is a not-too-sweet genius bevy.  Tacos are their thing.  Very casual atmosphere with good energy.  Patio sits along Scottsdale Road but it wasn't an issue for us.  Metal bar stools at high tops are a bit smaller.  Fresh outdoor lounge area is seat yourself, if available.  Service very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Best service, best food, super clean and the free chips and salsa are amazing. Also most of their meals come with two sides so it is worth the price! Try their pick two tacos and get lobster and shrimp on corn tortillas with the sides of black beans and their smashed potatoes...YUMMY! This location is the best one."}
{"text":"Today was our first time to Loco Patron (North Scottsdale location) and we were so disappointed. This is a new location in Scottsdale. At first glance the menu looked a little expensive for the items listed, but we thought perhaps they might be worth it. They were not. I had the Protein Salad. The ingredients sounded great but upon arrival, the salad had a very little bit of all the listed ingredients  (i.e two tiny pieces of cheese, the equivalent of 1 strawberry, and couldn't find the other items.)  with the exception of the black beans which covered the entire salad; and overwhelmed any of the other flavors, and the entire thing was one big soggy mess. I spoke to the server about it, and he said he would tell the chef, which didn't do much for me. My husband had the carnitas salad. The carnitas were very small \"pellets\" of meat. You couldn't really tell it was carnitas, and the overall taste of his salad was very bland. This was our Valentine's lunch and it was so disappointing (can't think of another word that best describes our experience). Doubt we will be going back."}
{"text":"Great spot to stop for a beer and some food.  Great grilled chicken fingers.  Happy hour, during a big game, or anytime on the weekend you should find a good crowd."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The waffle fries are to die for! The fish tacos are delicious. The chips & salsa are excellent! The downfall is service.  I was with a party of five... sitting at a long rectangle table.  The waitress brought one basket of chips & one cup of salsa.  Given the set up of the table, we all couldn't even reach the chips & salsa! When we asked for more the waitress was nice, but clueless to figure out that more than one was needed to start with!  Someone in our party ordered a single taco. Meet & cheese.  Nothing more.  She got meet & avocado with cheese on top.  The waitress was confused as to why that was wrong.   So to review... great food, delicious.  Subpar service ... just a clueless girl.  We had to ask to order drinks, she didn't ask, she did not understand large parties, rectangular tables & adequate chips & salsa & a simple taco order stumped her.   For tourists you'll be fine... they aren't repeat customers, but for locals like me, the service is an issue."}
{"text":"Work around the Tempe location... Not bad for a quick lunch  or after work drink with friends. The food is okay , not great but not the worst I've had either"}
{"text":"This is ahwatukee best place to watch a game or have beer. Good prices and a clean place. The food is good and Mexian is the flavor. But also has all the traditional goodies like wings and burgers."}
{"text":"service is slow, food is one star, place looks like a dump, pleaseeee buy some new chairs on the patio"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good lil' joint.   We went there on Sunday @ ~ 5pm. It was not crowded at all and we got a table right away. Lil' girl came and asked what we want to drink. We shooed her away as we were not ready. But we made up our minds in a few min and she came right back to take our order for drinks. In the meanwhile chips and tasty salsa made its way to the table. By the time she came back with out Margaritas we were ready to order food and did so.   We got some soup and a Burrito Enchilada Style. Soup was properly warmed and sized and tasted good, to boot. Burrito was HUGE! Did i say HUGE? I never EVER seen gianormous burrito like this in my life, and l love Mexican food and consume quite a bit of it. So... it was HUGE! And tasted real good too.   All in all, it was good food for a fair price. I can not complain one single bit and will more then likely come back there.  \"I like\" \"Very nice\"  Eugene"}
{"text":"We went for Taco Tuesday and I highly recommend!  The prices are amazing for what you get!  They don't reduce size or whats included at all!  We even got a few appetizers as well!  Our bellies and wallets left being very full!  I liked the food so much I would go back on any day of the week and pay any price!"}
{"text":"Very average food. We went here for brunch after another restaurant had a wait. The atmosphere is very pleasant, with a cool outdoor area complete with corn hole and other games. Overall, wasn't impressed with the food or drinks, but atmosphere was cool."}
{"text":"Ate, drank and watched UFC fights there last night. Was a full house with great food, service and atmosphere.  Drinks seemed to be on the week side but experience was great."}
{"text":"Came here right before happy hour was over. We had some bumps in our service but food was delicious! I wanted to give a shout out to Rachel and the owner Billy. Rachel wasn't our server but I wish she was! She was very attentive and checked on us frequently to make sure we were doing well. Giver her a raise!! Billy was great! He came by our table was willing to do whatever to make our visit great and to earn us back. Definitely left happy (and FULL)! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Super convenient after the Rock 'n' Roll Arizona marathon. No wait for a booth for four, quick service, really tasty tacos."}
{"text":"I'm a taco snob and I love Loco Patron. The tacos are fresh and there's plenty of options. Staff is respectful and makes recommendations if you're undecided. Lot's of flat screen TVs too."}
{"text":"Dear Loco Patron, if you are going to make the effort of having great, friendly staff and good drink and food options, then please make sure your kitchen staff learn how important it is to present food in an appropriate manner - presentation (and taste) are everything when it comes to customer choices.  The Loco Trio today looked like the birds had been picking at it. If you use salad ingredients as a plate garnish, then please do it right. Not make it look like a complete mess!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 STARS I WOULD !! My boyfriend took me on a lunch date in Scottsdale. We decided mexican. We saw Loco patron and went for it. Come to find out there was only ONE WAITRESS, ONE BAR TENDER which was the Manager! And the cook. We all bump into life situations I am sure they didn't intend for it to be this way. They were actually the best host we could have had. There attitudes remained happy and respectful. The entire place was filled with dishes and left over food on each table. While customers are still coming. They held there own! Me and my boyfriend out of kindness because that's who we are to help bust the tables. We felt so bad for them. She has a long day ahead of her but honestly I don't think there could be anyone else better for the position. I want to give a huge shoot out to Tim and Melissa B!! And the food was BOMB! So freaken GOOD! loved everything about this beautiful disaster. The vibes were relaxing and she never once got frustrated. Neither did he. We will be back! Thanks guys! Keep up the killer attitudes and work. #skills"}
{"text":"It can be hot sitting outside but I loved the patio misters system! My coworkers did not agree because they did not want their food wet or their clothes.   I had their lobster taco and their beer battered fish taco. I love the blend of it all, but if you're a health freak then I would not suggest these for you. However, it was Cuatro de Mayo so it went well with their house Margarita.   If you care about getting your bang for your buck, I would suggest getting the taco plates as it does come with \"side of salad\" but the salad portion looked the same as a regular salad plate!!! So the portions are a bit much...well maybe not so much if you're listed as an obese American.   I deducted the one start simply because I did not see a lunch rush and the waitress forgot the box but she definitely did not forget to come get the check."}
{"text":"If you're into Ahwatukee Housewives swapping and popping prescription smack on Saturday night, having your ass grabbed by a creepy divorcee old enough to be your father, weak sauce beverages and \"Mexican food\" that makes Taco Bell look appealing, then you will absolutely love Loco Patron.  I also haven't been back in four years, so maybe things have changed. Still, I wouldn't go out of my way to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Kera is the best thing about Loco Patron! She is accommodating, fun and makes great recommendations. I've only lived in the Scottsdale area for a few months and I always return to this place for the service and atmosphere!  Thanks Loco and Kera!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for Taco Tuesday. They have a really excellent selection of tacos that you can pretty much customize. If you're eating low carb or gluten free they offer a lettuce cup instead of a tortilla. I love the fish taco it's my favorite! There are shot and drink specials on the menu too!"}
{"text":"I've been here for happy hour a few times, it's always decent.    I brought a client in for lunch today...  Great Fajitas!    Enough said..."}
{"text":"Yes, Interesting. That's my view. How such a place with such a very nice Poke' dish can serve the worst salsa I've had in years is beyond me. Yes the Poke' Bowl I had was very nice. Super tasty and filling and well worth the price. But to be honest I almost left after tasting the Salsa they brought out. It was more water or what passes for a liquid and less a tomato based app with flavor than anything else. It did have some flavor but I only noticed that after trying a spoonful. Because I couldn't get enough on a chip to do more than lightly wet the poor thing. I'd imagine they put less effort into the first thing you taste to drive off those that only want a beer and a snack and then leave. In my view, the first thing you taste should be stellar and inspire you to try more of the food. My rating is for the Poke' only."}
{"text":"I've been going to loco for years and realized I never wrote them a review! I had lunch yesterday at loco and had a great experience as always. I love their chips and salsa and wish I could have them every day! I usually go to pre game before going out  but yesterday I went for lunch. I ordered the chicken Taquitos per usual and a side of rice and beans. Everything came out great as expected and the customer service is great. Loco always has happy hour specials and taco Tuesday but also great to go any time or day. Keep up the good work loco! :)"}
{"text":"Based on some of the other reviews I have avoided this place for years even though I work right down the street. But I finally tried it for lunch the other day and I ended up totally cleaning my plate!  The food is not authentic Mexican by any means but it is darn tasty. I highly recommend the black beans,"}
{"text":"Great spot, have to be 21 plus on taco Tuesday. Cheap but amazing tacos and great service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Most of the reviews for this place seem to be short and sweet, and I can definitely see why. When I lived in Scottsdale I would occasionally stop here when gallivanting through Old Town for a drink or two. Nothing is really memorable about the place. It's a cheesy, Baja-style bar. I've never had the food, so I can't comment on it, but the margaritas are okay. I don't think the drink prices are exuberant or anything, there fine. When I was in town for a recent visit I used this place as a bridge between other bars, pretty much like I used to do. It's not a bad place to stop at for a drink or two when your out with friends, but not the place you'll want to hang out at all night. It's okay."}
{"text":"I've been to this Loco Patron a few times, but never longer than about 15 minutes.   Why am I giving a place 4 stars that I rushed out of so quickly?   This place is the perfect spot to grab a drink if you have to wait for the Light Rail when heading downtown. I don't live real close to a light rail stop, so when I use it, I get dropped off at the station right next to the place (like, RIGHT next to this place), and inevitably miss the train I wanted to catch and have to kill 15-20 minutes. That's when I stop in here and grab a marg or beer.  It's a pretty spacious bar & always looks clean. This last time I stopped in was during Happy Hour, and I honestly never realized how good a HH Loco has. I don't ever hang out on Mill, but I'll continue to stop in here for a drink when using Light rail to head downtown. Also, now that I know what they're HH is like I'll keep Loco in mind when I go out in Scottsdale (I'm assuming both locations have the same specials)."}
{"text":"Came for my first Taco Tuesday (ever). Sat by the bar -  the bartenders were nice and always kept a good eye on our beer.  Husband and I tried a bunch of tacos. The $2 ones were okay, but we both like the $1 tacos and ordered a second round of them. The crowd was mixed as far as age is concerned. Overall loved the experience!"}
{"text":"They have a GREAT happy hour menu that goes until 7PM! I got the shredded beef quesadilla and their specialty taco and they were both great! I also got the blended strawberry Margarita and it was very tasty! Will definitely be back for happy hour."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant I have ever been to ! The servers are really nice and super quick and my food came out perfectly ! The chicken poblano enchiladas are the best  10/10 would defiantly recommend"}
{"text":"Great potential, badly executed.  I came here for Taco Tuesdays... awesome prices. $1 for beef, chicken, pork tacos, $2 for steak, mahi, and crispy fish tacos. $2 domestic and imported drafts, $3 margaritas and Sauza shots.  Horrible service. Not my first time here, but on this instance I had to wait 30 minutes to order a drink and tacos. And 15 minutes after that I had to ask my waitress where my drink was.  Frustrating. Good margaritas tho."}
{"text":"This was our first time at any Loco Patron location. It was my husband, myself, and our toddler. Our server was Courtney and she was spectacular! She was very accommodating and helpful with me needing vegan options! I would definitely come back because of the amazing service we got!"}
{"text":"New Crunchy Pork Tacos are awesome! Tortilla soup in the winter can't be beat either. Great Patio right in the heart of Old Town."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love some good mexican food?  I've been here a few times now and it never seems to disappoint.  Their food is super yummy especially their waffle fries.  It's basically like nachos but with fries instead of chips.  Pair that with a nice house margarita and it's cheap, yummy, and delicious.  Who could go wrong?  The atmosphere is fantastic and their staff is super friendly.  Oh and they also walk around handing out free beer on Saturdays.  SCORE!"}
{"text":"So almost every other Tuesday my best friend and I drive 40 mins to Old Town to get tacos. We probably spend 20-30 minutes at LP, then spend another 40 minutes driving home. Yes, they're that good! They're very American styled tacos, so don't expect the street type. I use to be a big fan of the chicken but have moved on to bigger, better things - the crunchy fish! My friend also gets the fish mahi and shrimp. They're all delicious! The chips and salsa, queso, and pizza cookie are also delicious! And you can't beat the Taco Tuesday price! And like I mentioned above, we're in and out in about 20 minutes - super quick service!"}
{"text":"My favorite day to go here is on Tuesday's for taco Tuesday's. Amazing \"naked\" tacos with no shell but instead come in a cute lettuce wrap is genius and delicious!   Bartenders are usually pretty great as well.  5/5 for great tacos and service!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Loco Patron in Tempe. I started visiting this location 2 years ago and have religiously gone back about every week since. First, the staff is amazing. Ben, Jeremy and Tanner are absolutely wonderful bartenders. They are always friendly and go out of their way to make their customers feel welcome. The atmosphere they bring to Loco is different than any of the other bars/restaurant on mill. Second, the food is absolutely delicious. It has had the same wonderful taste for the past two years. I love their salsa and would highly recommend it. Also, their ground beef tacos and crunchy fish tacos are to die for. Finally, the price is great for the amount and quality of the food, as well, as any alcoholic beverages. Taco Tuesday prices are fantastic and a great way to go out with a group of friends if you're on a budget. Anytime I have company come in from out of town my first stop is Loco (the mill location). They have always been highly impressed too. I would HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend stopping in for a bite to eat or a delicious margarita at this Loco Patron location."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the Loco Patron in Tempe (on Mill Ave.) so I was excited to try out this location (even though they are owned by different people) and talk about being beyond disappointed.... IT WAS TERRIBLE. My food was so bland and my ground beef taco meat was a lukewarm temperature like it had been sitting out. The service was AWFUL, which wasn't surprising because I had read this in several other reviews. I was so disappointed and would rather drive to Tempe to go to Loco Patron than eat at this location ever again!!!"}
{"text":"We used to Love Loco Patron, good food at a good price for Scottsdale. We hadn't been a a couple months, came for lunch as usual and the food was a miss. Prices went up, they got rid of the Hot Bottled Sauces/salt and pepper Table Caddy. When asked for Hot Sauces we were delivered a bucket with 2 squirt bottles filled with hot sauce that look like it hadn't been cleaned in months  Service was OK, we had to request Chips and Salsa twice. The Salsa looked different/strange from the past \"Blenderfied\" would be the best way to describe, not even red but rather pink. We ordered the Loco Taco Salad with Steak and the Smothered Burrito. The food used to have a punch to it now it was blah. I questioned maybe they change ownership and they are cutting costs?  Service OK, Food very OK."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. We reserved two tables for a large party told we would have a dedicated waitress. And we did not. The server was rude they closed our tabs without asking us. Drinks didn't come out We were rushed it was just an over all bad experience. Told the manager and he didn't seem to care. We will never be coming back again"}
{"text":"Would definitely not recommend. Lucky I gave it any stars at all. I love to support local businesses but this was an awful experience.  Heard great things about their salt and pepper wings...horrible. Like fried chicken.  No taste. Took us 45 mins to get our food. Even though we were the only ones in the restaurant. The other people were just in the bar drinking. Chips were extra after the first basket. Really???  The wings my hubby ordered were burnt.  The server didn't know it was happy hour all day so we got overcharged on the drinks. Do not go here.  It isn't worth your Money or your time.   UPDATE: since they are locally owned I messaged them on Facebook to let them know how disappointing it was. I know I would want to know if it was my business. The GM Jon got back with me within an hour or two and said to come back and try them again and it would be on the house. So I will try again and update. Hoping for a different outcome  UPDATE #2.  Was getting my car serviced so thought I would give them a try again. Mistake. Ordered 6 salt n pepper wings.  Driest most burnt chicken ever. I don't know how they stay in business. Really too bad. Waiter was attentive though."}
{"text":"for me it is local drinking spot (4-5 stars) ... neighborhood, local bar. the food is average (3 stars) but I have always received great service (4-5 stars). I frequent the place once or twice a month over several years. Typically I get beer and taco. as I read the other reviews on negative service, not sure that I can relate ... maybe a one off experience. again, I have had very few bad service experiences over the years and those bad occasions have happened during a taco Tuesday experience when they are understaffed. thus I stopped going on Tuesdays ..."}
{"text":"No. Just, no.   We went on a slow day and had no idea what we were in for. Our server was nonexistent for the first 30 minutes, when she finally did show she took another 30 to get our beers. Did I mention the place was 1/4 full? Ridiculous. The coronas were 4 bucks which is crazy when you can walk over to Dos and get them for $2.50. The tables around us were also complaining at the lack of attention. The food here is bland at best. Just don't do it."}
{"text":"My husband and I sat at the bar for happy hour twice and were not disappointed.  This is a great spot to rest after walking around downtown Scottsdale.  The drinks are delicious and their HH food menu has decent prices and a good value.  My husband loved their chicken quesadilla and salsa.  I love their white queso skillet dip and smashed potatoes.  Their grilled chicken fingers looks so darn good and smelled amazing.  I was bummed we had already eaten when they brought them to someone at the bar.  Will be back to try those next timne!"}
{"text":"Love their happy hour menu! Everything on it was excellent. I'd recommend the potato skin something (don't really remember name) but they were all so delicioso. Also, love the outdoor seating! Might I add the servers are attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Great food, and even more awesome service. The bartenders are great and we never have to wait long for food/drinks. This place is awesome for fight nights as well. Overall,  Ive never had a bad experience here and I recommended to anyone all ages"}
{"text":"Nice, but I'm Native American (Menominee) and the \"Shoot Buffalo\" sign bothered me so screw this place. Nothing special about their food anyway."}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time with a group of 9 for taco Tuesday night. We were immediately welcomed by a friendly server, who cleared a table for us, then we were seated after 5 min short wait.  Our drinks were taken and delivered in a timely manner, and our orders were placed. From there it went downhill.  Four of us ordered shrimp tacos, we all got shredded beef tacos instead. We all had to wait for them to fix our orders. Once we did get our shrimp tacos, I must say they were quite tasty, even though it was on a flour tortilla and not corn like I asked. My side of guac never came, even though I asked twice. Aaaand of course I was charged for it.  So they stumbled through their service to us, and I have no clue how they could screw up that bad.  Throughout all this, our server remained very friendly. Because of this, perhaps I'll go back since it's so close to my house, only this time I will sit at the bar with a +1 only. Hopefully their margaritas will be redeeming."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday's here are the best, and their margaritas rock! Stale chips and watery salsa need some work, but all their other food is great."}
{"text":"The place is busy and we thought we'd try it on a Wed. night.  The waitress was too busy flirthing with the guy patrons and we could not get served so we left."}
{"text":"I went to this place the week they opened, so I certainly may come back to this review once they have established themselves on Mill Avenue, but for now... 3 stars.  The servers and cooks were all still learning, so I won't make a mention of the service quality, but the food left something to be desired. The cheese seemed like it was out of a Kraft shredded cheese ziploc from the grocery store and the tortillas were bland as could be. The meat was pretty good though! I had the pork, chicken, and beef (1 taco each) and I enjoyed it. Chips and salsa was pretty damn good and pretty damn free, so plus points there.  We got in a few minutes past happy hour, but they still honored happy hour prices for the first few minutes of our stay--that was pretty cool of them to do; that gesture earned them my return visit. The place is in a very nice, commercial looking building literally on the Mill Ave light rail stop. I feel like this will soon (give it a few years) become the replacement for Barney's on University (RIP) just because of how easy it is to get to. Bathrooms were clean and there is an AMAZING view of \"A\" Mountain from the inside bar and the patio.  I look forward to LP's future on Mill."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to this place for fight night as we walked in great atmosphere we liked the set up! We had a waitress named Rachel she wasn't very attentive to our table she got our drinks on the wrong tab she gave herself a larger tip than we had already given her  I called and spoke to the manager they handled the problem right away and were very apologetic for the incident. I would recommend this place just watch out for Rachel if she's your waitress if she's done it to us who know's who else she has done this to or how long it's been going on?"}
{"text":"Came here to check out the margaritas and bar food Bar food usually isnt the best but its always good to eat while youre drinking Anywho I had me a beergarita and I really liked it The service was nice and it was a pretty chill atmosphere I think its a great location and I had a good experience here I think it would be a good place for a group of friends After all it is on Mill Now you can start your crawl on the North End and stumble down South  :D"}
{"text":"Convenient location and great food sets this Mill avenue bar apart from the cliche college thumpers.  Great wait staff pampers to all your shot needs while cooking up tasty mexican food. Delicious margaritas all at a good price."}
{"text":"Loved it. Came for lunch and ordered carne Asada waffle fries which were awesome. And a street taco which was also great. Cold beers and nice, friendly waitress. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos only on Sunday mornings. Hash browns that come with are the deep fried kind from McDonalds. Aren't we at a place with wait service? Very disappointing.   Chips and salsa are very unflavorful and the food in the kitchen seems like it's coming out from someone that hates their job. I'll have to try one of the other restaurants on Mill Avenue next time."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa cost $5 with no refills on small portions. Pitcher of margaritas suppose to fill 4 glasses, didn't even fill 3. Food marginally ok. Service slow. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some margaritas, they were out of this world , not sweet and made with blue agave , just delicious. I had two and it knocked me off my butt for the rest of the afternoon. Also had shredded chicken nachos that were very very yum. We sat outside. If I didn't live in Boston I would def return for more"}
{"text":"Been here twice for taco Tuesday. Tacos are amazing but service is lacking. Pretty cool atmosphere though and outside patio doesn't feel too hot because of misters. Worth checking out for the tacos"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great drink specials! The staff was very friendly and I mean who doesn't love Taco Tuesday?!"}
{"text":"Closest thing I found to ease my Tex-mex craving after an evening of mountain climbing.  Ordered a soft ground beef taco with avacado and fried chicken taco, along with white queso and chips. Absolutely delicious. The ground beef won the fight so I ordered another.   Happened to be here on Taco Tuesday for $2 a taco and save a few bucks. Normally $5.  Go here and be happy."}
{"text":"I have seen this place forever but never went. Was on the mood for taco Tuesday night out so me and the hubby decided to go to Patron. It was pretty crowded got there around 6 but they had seats at the bar on the patio which was perfect since it was a nice night. They had a dj who was great playing everything drink specials and tacos were cheap and the tacos were amazeballs. I got the crunchy taco one beef one chicken and they were so good. The bartenders were super cool too. It was a cool vibe and fun spot out on a Tuesday night. We will definitely be back another Tuesday and maybe another day as well."}
{"text":"Emma was incredible! Seriously awesome, kind and attentive. If you go in, ask for her section, you won't be disappointed! Thanks Emma!"}
{"text":"The food here is terrible. It's more of a fun hangout place to watch games, especially if you're a drinker. If you are coming just for the food, don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"We were not greeted at the door so were confused about seating, where to sit, so we decided to sit at the bar. After waiting for a few moments, the bartender comes up and asks\"what can I get you?\" Well how about a menu. What a dumb question. The menu was kind of odd, over priced for the area, nothing really interesting on the menu. The place was disorganized, absent of a manager. I will be surprised if they last a year. Too many better options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great Grub and great staff.  Loco is a great place to visit any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Lots of TV's, great variety of food and pretty much anything you could ask for in a full bar. Great location, close to lite rail in Tempe. I went twice on this trip and each time every bartender that interacted with us was very pleasant. Chips and salsa were just okay, but the tacos were pretty dang good, and the dessert cookie ice cream thing was ridiculously great. One complaint, they allow people to smoke in the \"outdoor\" patio area which has a sliding garage door separating from inside, so basically they're smoking inside and you can smell it."}
{"text":"Finally! A restaurant that's gonna work in this location. Local Patron is a modern Mexican restaurant, great menu, great ambience, great bar TVs everywhere. The deck outside is perfect for socializing hanging out we're having a party. I've only been here once and the food so far has been great. Anxious to try to again. I love to go to places where you immediately walk in the door and you just feel welcome and it's low-key and easy and you know that you're going to have high-quality food and drinks. You need to try it out!! Dutch~"}
{"text":"Was driving by and saw the sign that the restaurant was open. So we stopped to give it a try. My first thing to check is if they use soy oil. The waitress went to confirm type of oil used. Surprisingly a man came over and introduced himself - Chris. He said he was advised I was allergic to soy. He asked me what I was thinking to order and what food to avoid. He nixed the nachos  and anything fried, (My thighs appreciated that!) as the oil used was soy and canola combo. I decided to order steak fajitas said they would carve it fresh after cleaning g everything and making sure there was no soy. It was fantastic and I didn't get hives! Always a bonus!! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 6 on separate checks. I wasn't a huge fan of the tip being added already as that's usually for a group of 8. I would go back through because the food was great, margaritas were great. I had the caesar wrap and it was delicious. We shared the carne asada fries and the table loved them-they were a little spicy for me. Most of the table had street tacos and loved them."}
{"text":"Everyone already knows this is the spot for delish  margaritas!. I would recommend the street cart tacos on flour, or the red sauce enchiladas/rice an refried beans"}
{"text":"Overall, Loco Patron is in a great downtown location. With a free parking structure right behind it, it is pretty convenient. Taco Tuesday was bomb and you've got to try the crunchy tacos. Being downtown you have easy access to other places to go afterwards to grab more drinks.   ---- and to the details ---- We came here to meet up with friends and the restaurant was pretty packed. We eventually found a table on the patio and the server came pretty quick to greet us. She eventually brought us menus and some water after walking past several times.   Once we got our menus we ordered WAY too many taco Tuesday tacos. They have soft shell flour and corn along with their famous, award winning crunchy tacos. You're able to add additional toppings (avocado, etc) for extra as well as some taco Tuesday shots to your order.   After giving out order, which you wrote on a piece of paper and hand over we quickly got our tacos! Presentation was good (better than the picture, I promise) and the tacos were bomb. I thought the crunchy tacos were great but they weren't crazy extra good - I really enjoyed the soft shell ones as well.   The place was pretty packed with a typical representation of a Scottsdale crowd. We enjoyed our time here though. I'd definitely come here for another taco Tuesday deal!"}
{"text":"Had the Carna Asada torta...this sandwich was amazing! Also had some smashed potatoes and Cole slaw. I'm usually not a Cole slaw fan but it was tasty even though it maybe could've had a little more dressing. Haven't had anything bad on the menu at all! Good food and fun people!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and location. Good selection of beers and cocktails. Food menu looks great but we went with the Elote which is two ears of roasted corn with cheese and sauce. Very nicely done but we felt the price was way out of line. It's corn!  Probably costing them about 10 cents an  ear but it is on the menu at $8. Everything else seemed to be priced right but they really need to re-think this one. We'll be back for football season."}
{"text":"Fun mexican sports bar dining. The drinks are strong.. but sadly their signature cocktail the Loco Patron margarita is not very good. We ordered the guacamole and chips... Erika is wild about her gaucamole. I had the steak fajitas which were very yummy and generous in size. The table salsa is not as good as Chevy's; something of  a watery tomato soup; they need more chunks. Warm spring nights make this a great place to hang out outside. Next time i am in town this will be one of my stops."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the food was fresh and Delish. We had the award winning taco, avocado taco, and the quest blanco skillet.  Our Bartender was friendly and very helpful. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The place looked like a great time because of the ASU game. We loved the bartenders."}
{"text":"Usually at least somewhat busy - this bar has a few things going for it... For one, it's got a great location - although it's a little close to competitor Salty Senorita. Second, it's got chips and salsa and standard mexi food and the kitchen is \"open late\" (whatever that means). The food isn't so bad - it gets the job done... but I don't know that I'd suggest it for a sit-down meal. Maybe it's good if you're planning on making it a long night and you want to get some food to keep you going. I don't know...   The layout of Loco is fairly comfortable and casual - although when it's crowded, it gets difficult to navigate around the small bar to get a drink. When you do get a drink, they aren't weak or terribly expensive. The problem with this bar is that it's a douche-fest. Looking around the room on any given weekend night, you can just go \"douche, douche, douche, plastic, douche, plastic, douche...\" and you'll know there's probably $8000 worth of fancy jeans in room. It's a slightly different crowd from Salty's I think. There are a lot of good looking people there usually, but it's just not my crowd. Maybe I'm getting too old."}
{"text":"If you have driven by Loco Patron you know its busy,  Not sure why people are giving such low starts. The fan club here is loyal to the drinks and food.  I don't ever think I have been to this place when it does not have a good group of people hanging out.    The Scottsdale location puts Local Patron between the bar side of Old Town Scottsdale and the Club side.  Here you find a great mixture of the dressed up Scottsdale folks as well as a t-shirt wearing crowed.  I hope to see more positive reviews on this place, see for your self why this bar has a large following."}
{"text":"Good for Happy Hour Drinks ONLY!!! Terrible service and food. If they are going to charge like a Scottsdale location then they need to deliver Scottsdale service!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! We were there on Taco Tuesday and the tacos and sides were $2.00 each. Our group tried mahi mahi, pork, chicken, & shredded beef tacos. All were excellent! The beef torta was also great. One of the best we've had. The sides were also very yummy! Beans & rice had a lot of flavor. They offer a side called smashed potatoes. They were really good and very filling! Our waitress was very attentive and the ambiance was really fun. Loved how the place was decorated. And the restrooms were very clean."}
{"text":"This place absolutely sucks for service.  The last three times I have been in I have had to wait 15 minutes to get a beer or go to the bar and get one myself. The wait staff is often surly, unless they are drinking with you. I had one waitress tonight bang into my table three times as she passed by, never making eye contact or saying sorry. If they were slammed with customers you could make an excuse but half the place was empty.  The only redeeming qualities are the fact they show UFC fights, the indoor/outdoor bar setup is probably the best in the area and the food is decent. Not outstanding but ok.  I live fairly close by so this would be a great place to go but I am just tired of crappy service from people who don't care."}
{"text":"Walking around Scottsdale during lunch time.  Decided to stop in here rather than walk a few more blocks to Los Dos.  In hindsight, we should have walked!  Party of 6, 4 adults, 2 kids.  I ordered the tortilla soup - $6 for a bowl.  It was good, lots of chicken and was tasty.  When I asked for chips to put into my soup, I was told that we woud be charged for more chips because we had already received 2 chip portions and they charged $2 for more chips after that.  This did not please me.  We had 6 people at the table and the chip \"baskets\" that they use could not possibly have more than 1 cup of chips per basket.  I have NEVER been told that there was a charge for chips in a mexican food restaurant.  I will note though, that this place does not really qualify as mexican - think Tex Mex.    I thought that the serving sizes were pretty measily for the prices they charge.  One person at our table ordered two tacos with beans and rice ($10).  The tacos were very small and were served with about 4 Tablespoons each of beans and rice.  BUT, if you like lettuce, you'd be in for a treat!  Half the plate space was taken up with shredded lettuce to fill the space that should have had FOOD on it!  My kids split the chicken tenders and fries plate (also $10).  They received 4 tenders and a handful of waffle fries.  I don't know that we've ever paid $10 for something that would normally be on a kids menu at any other place for about $6.  It looked like our server was serving the entire restaurant.  We motioned to two girls who were standing near the chips talking.  They both came over and asked if we needed something.  We said we were ready to order and they said that they would find our server because they were \"training.\"  They only thing we saw them do was stand and talk over at the chip counter.      Considering how many great places there are to eat in the area, I would not chose to eat here again.  Can't really find anything that makes this place stand out from any other ho-hum place.  The price of the food and what actually was on the plate did not seem to correlate to each other.  No thanks"}
{"text":"A great location and nice outdoor patio.  The tacos were delicious (I love the sauce that comes on the side), but the server brought me the wrong beer, the tortilla chips were stale, and the salsa tasted really weird.  Not bad, but not great."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Old town. I love the salt and pepper wings. The service is amazing here!"}
{"text":"I think the patron was loco for thinking he could pass his \"American ways\" off as a Mexican one. A pretty tight atmosphere, dim sports bar. You seat and fill out what you would like to have, toppings, etc on a piece of paper that your waitress comes and pick up for you. They have good happy hour and OK margaritas but the flavor in damn near everything we tasted screamed anything authentic and was very mild and nothing banging about it. When I asked why, the ditsy waitress said because customers would say it is too spicy. It's Mexican and it's in our culture don't water it down! Go to an Authentic Restaurant like No Que NO Mexican Grill, literally right up Scottsdale Rd and they have amazing flavorful food and even more flavorful and one of a kind margaritas like Tamarindo and Mango Habanero. Oh, and ew, the chip salsa, ugh, no flavor at all. May have consisted of just two boiled tomatoes like pepper and salt."}
{"text":"Great service and Food, wonderful location with great music. I've been there the last 3 Taco Tuesday's and had the time of my life, the staff is so Friendly and talkative."}
{"text":"This place is just fine if you like the bar scene and don't mind yelling over your friends.  I had the Loco Taco salad and a skinny margarita and it was just fine for a bar atmosphere as I wasn't expecting gourmet cusine.  I would have tried the tortilla soup if it wasn't 110 degrees outside.  Just what I expected from a name like Loco Patron."}
{"text":"Every Tuesday I come here for naked fish tacos, and 3 dollar XX's best taco Tuesday patio."}
{"text":"Went on Taco Tuesday during lunch.  This place is gross and not worth your money.  First of all if you sit at the main bar, it smells like human urine.  Secondly the chips are stale and almost chewy, greasy and taste of rancid old oil.  The salsa was cold and I can find better in my jar at home in my own fridge. The guacamole was tasteless and boring, like nothing had been added to it at all.   The service was okay on a slow Tuesday and the tacos were acceptable but not the greatest.  You have to pay extra for a different salsa and it is too hot to consume.  It is too bad about this place it seems like a cute concept.  It could be alot better.  I do not recommend.  So sad and yuck!!!"}
{"text":"The wait staff is the best. I go during lunch all the time. Usually the old town scottsdale bars have terrible service . Not here. The tacos are some of the best I have had in Arizona. I hate queso but love the what they offer here. Bartender that is the waiter at lunch remembers me and my order. He always makes great recommendations to anyone I bring here, 5 stars all day long."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very poor service.   We sat at the bar and always had to ask for drinks, food water, etc. Plenty of people working but didn't seem to pay attention to patrons.  They wouldn't make eye contact."}
{"text":"Had drinks and appetizers at Loco Patron tonight. The patio is always a fun place to sit and people watch, munch on the pork tacos, and have a few beers. Always a good crowd, so you never feel alone at the bar or the patio seating. Loco does a great job of serving an eclectic mix of people, young and old, casual and a bit dressed up. Try the shrimp tacos or fajitas for a special treat with a cold beer. Plan to sit outside--it's the place to be"}
{"text":"This Loco Patron location just opened this week so take this review with a grain of margarita salt. They could very well improve.  I'm a sucker for good margaritas and have seen the signs announcing this joint for months, so when I saw it open I had to take a look.  My first impression is that they've built a nice little sports bar, but furnished it like a Mexican food joint. TVs all over the wall and bar, saccharine pop/rock playing over the speakers, and a rustic cabinet where they keep straws, napkins, and the servers' purses. It's a medium-sized place, not big enough for a huge crowd, but it'd likely handle about half an hour of a pub crawl stop before the place got uncomfortable and folks moved on.  I sidled up to the bar and asked for a house margarita and a menu, both came back quickly along with a free mini-basket of chips and salsa. The salsa was actually really good, mild for the gringos but just a little kick on the backend. The margarita, on the other hand, was pretty awful. It had the right color, but the guy at the bar used way too much sweet and not nearly enough sour. It tasted like a flat sprite. I also couldn't tell if there was actually alcohol in there, which is never a good sign.  I ordered fajitas and those were also a little sweet for some odd reason. Maybe not enough salt when they cooked it up, I don't know. In any case, it was edible but not at all remarkable.   When the bill came the barman rang me up for the wrong dish, overcharging me, but when I pointed out the mistake he quickly fixed it so no real harm done.  Mill Avenue has a bunch of existing Mexican food places, all with their own charms, and I don't understand why a business owner thought Mill Ave. needed another. So far these folks aren't doing anything which sets them apart from the others and I'd be surprised to see them still open this time next year. That said, I'd welcome improvements that prove me wrong. The ball is in your court, Loco Patron."}
{"text":"Yummy margaritas and nachos - slow service, salads weren't that great, soup was not good at all. Stick to margaritas and nachos and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst food and atmosphere ever!  It's St Patrick's Day and the music was so loud and horrible and then to top it off...so was the food!  I've been coming here for years for cocktails and wings, but I can honestly say, I will never be back!  We ordered the nachos and they served it with just chips and beef...no cheese, no salsa, no tomatoes...nothing!  I'm not one to usually complain but Billy and Eddie, it was pathetic!  Taco Bell serves better food!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour, great menu options, yummy food and a fun outdoor area! I was actually surprised to hear it had only 3 stars because the menu offered so many yummy options, countless drinks and had an amazing outdoor space.  The Happy hour menu was probably my favorite with great drink specials and lots of apps & plates to share!   I had only been to the location in old town and this one offers a cute and spacious outdoor entertainment area with a much better menu. Cute aesthetic and lots of tv's for sports lover- great atmosphere.   The one complaint I had was service was slow considering there was hardly anyone in the restaurant at the time we were there. Otherwise, fun restaurant and bar!"}
{"text":"They have UW flags and gear everywhere so we were looking to figure out why. Asked the waitress when entering and rolled her eyes and said \"oh, we're a Wisconsin bar\". When I asked what that meant she told us that the owners are from WI. She was really rude and didn't want to inquire as to why we're asking so we decided to keep walking.  We're both from WI and were really interested to find a UW bar in Scottsdale. Too bad she wasn't very welcoming."}
{"text":"Best taco tuesday spot we have been to yet.  The happy hour specials are great too.  Come for both and you are in for a treat!  Claudia was our server and was very pleasant, was fun to talk to and was knowledgable of the menu.  The food portions are perfect ordered 3 tacos and had to take one home.  If you are wanting some GREAT food l, come here!"}
{"text":"Some waitress \"KiKi\" was very rude and grabbed me rough. Not a good employee."}
{"text":"Crunchy fish tacos - the best in the Tuke and maybe the Valley. The burger is excellent as well. Solid sports bar."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful!!! And the prices were great too. Had their tacos and chimichanga...both were delicious...especially enjoyed the tacos. A local bar with outside patio....but had great food!"}
{"text":"I stand by my principle in saying Mexican restaurants have the best burger and fries. On a lovely ciabatta bun with pepper jack cheese and not cooked to shoe leather, that is how a burger should be.  Wife had the shrimp tacos and swore they were to die for.  Habanero wings? Hot. Very hot. But very good also.  Now we were in on Cinco de Mayo and it was packed so I'm not gonna ding the service for that, but you could tell they seemed to be a little unprepared for all the people. Live music was good and if your into cougar hunting this seems like a nice spot to try."}
{"text":"Got in for Happy Hour last night.  The watiress was nice - she was very recognizant of the fact it was 10 til 7, and wanted us to make the HH cut-off. The bouncer was very nice too, surprisingly.  The patio has nice heaters on it, so we were okay to sit outside after dark in December.  My vodka cranberry was strange - no ice, the cranberry was NOT juice. It was a water consistency but tasted somewhat like a cranberry syrup. Friend's pineapple/Bacardi looked like real pineapple juice though. Weird.  The wings were pretty good, just fatty. The mini tostadas were apparently really good,  though they were topped with parmesan (what?)"}
{"text":"Limited opinion - no food, just one drink, but I was totally impressed by my quick stop here. Based on others' reviews, could be because IMHO it's clearly a BAR that serves food, it's not a restaurant with a bar! One look at it and I wouldn't \"dine\" there, but I might order a taco if I were hungry. Lower your expectations and have a drink at the open-air bar.  My husband and I just wanted one margarita, it was actually open on a weeknight later than most services around. At first the LOUD music was what I call \"old white guy music,\" over-played rock classics. Sorry, ugh. Fortunately it soon switched to something more upbeat and current.   The adorable bartender (female with long dark hair) came over to take our order. She figured out I'm a Margarita princess, as I want 100% agave tequila and asked about their pre-mix. Cheap stuff gives me heartburn. She could tell I was kind of disappointed to hear they just use, well, kinda cheap stuff. Without my prompting, she created kind of a custom marg, adding more fresh lime juice and less pre-mix, as well as choosing a decent tequila but not over-charging for some brand that should be sipped not added to a marg. SHE DID GREAT.  For that, she gets 4 stars and a fat tip!!    Thanks for being open late on a random weeknight and hiring one cute competent staff person."}
{"text":"I've overheard the worst thing about this bar is the font size on the bill.....it's all about size people."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the spot!  Open late and a menu filled with options for just about anyone who loves Mexican food.    The service is fast and the food is great.  The habanero margarita was lip-smacking delicious.  My enchiladas were on point and the amount of food you get for what you pay is insane.  You will definitely leave full and satisfied with your meal.  Sitting outside people watching late night is the best part of this area.  Don't miss a chance to eat here if you have a hankering for late night Mexican or happy hour drinks."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times since this location has opened. I love it. I love savory margarita and the OG Protein bowl. They also offer brunch and have a Bloody Mary bar on Saturday and Sunday's too! If you haven't been here, you should give it a try."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend in AZ who brought me here to grab a bite before hitting up the nearby bars.  Around 9pm on a Friday, it wasn't that busy and we were able to get seats at the bar.  It would be a good place to watch a game since they have TVs everywhere.  The food here was surprisingly good. For $12 you can get two tacos and two sides.  I ordered a fish taco and a shrimp taco, but they brought two fish instead.  Luckily, their Crunchy Fish Taco is really good.  The cabbage, avocado cream and pico de gallo went well together and the beer battered cod stayed crunchy.  The refried beans and Spanish rice are good sides, but small portions.  You wouldn't think to get wings at a Mexican place, but I recommend getting their salt & pepper Loco Wings (12 for $10).  They're not that big, but they're tasty.  This a cool place to hang out with your friends.  It's the type of place I would've frequented when I was in college."}
{"text":"Lunch on a slow day BUT I ordered a Dos XXs lager on tap. (Sarcasm alert) I didn't realize my order was so complicated. The first beer was a bottle. The second was Dos XXs Amber on tap and the final was Dos XX lager on tap. Third times the charm I guess. Not comin back. If you decide to come here I hope you have a better experience.... ordering a beer."}
{"text":"Service by Rachel S was horrible. Have been here a few times. Have always enjoyed the food and service except for yesterday. We met up with some friend's, there were 7 of us. We had seperate checks for everyone but was charged a 18% gratuity. I'm assuming for a big party. Which makes no sense as we all paid seperate. Anyways that's not really the issue. Our server, Rachel S. Was horrible. Never checked on us, never asked for drink refills. We were all drinking beer and had plans on hanging out but our server was horrible and we got tired of not having our drinks refilled so we cashed out and went to the handlebar down the street and drank. The whole time we were there she was on her phone texting. I have no problem paying a pre calculated gratuity if you get good service. I figure she didn't care about us because she knew she was getting 18% off of each tab...so off  our table she got close to $30 which is crap because she was horrible. Being a server myself I pay close attention to this because I bust my ass for my tips and to see someone give customers crappy service and pocket tips that the customer had no option in paying is ridiculous.  I was not even in the mood to argue the gratuity,  I will just not go back. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Hot waitresses and good atmosphere for UFC, but wow the food is terrible. About on par with taco bell... Maybe."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I always start here when we decide to come to mill.  This is our go to.  I have to say we haven't eaten here a whole lot, but when we have the food is great!  Great quality food for a great price.  You  can tell the beans don't come from a can and that the salsa is made in house every day.    We usually just sit at the bar and drink before we start our night, for happy hour or to catch a game/event downtown.  The service is exceptional at Loco bar none.  We always are well taken care of at loco and haven't had even the slightest bad experience.    For instance, yesterday we stopped in for a few drinks and there was some miscommunication between the guys working the bar.  We didn't get a drink as soon as we usually do, but the guy that was helping us was more than apologetic and even bought us a free round!  A tasty little treat.    Loco plays the best music out of any bar on mill.  A good mix between 90's and current EDM but very relaxing overall.  Just what I am in the mood for 99% of the time.    Clean place, great food, great service! What is not to love!"}
{"text":"Everytime I drive by Loco Patron, it looks packed.  Not when I went! Damn!  We were literally the only ones in the bar, at 1330 on a Wednesday that wasn't too surprising though. The music is rather not good (they played madonna) and the place is just kind of .... there. I had an indifferent 3 star experience until I had a little run in with the bartender. I took a sip of my bottled beer and it was room temp. I called him over and asked if I could have the bill for our warm beers. He offered to \"get something else that might be colder\" and I declined. He then said if you don't want something else then why bitch about it dude? Whatever, I was trying to show my girl a good time for her 21st and didn't want to get in a big argument so I let it go.   Mark my words, I'll never go back. That was some serious attitude that was unnessecary."}
{"text":"Let's see where do we begin? There are lots of great Mexican restaurants to choose from so don't feel bad passing on this one. The smallest basket of chips and 2oz bowl of salsa are complimentary. You'll pay for refills. They DO NOT honor their own advertising and we didn't find out that our Restaurant.com certificate wouldn't be honored until I saw the notice posted on the bathroom mirror. Nice touch. The bathroom while acceptable in appearance smelled like urine."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've been here and if I could give this place less than one star I would. The service was slow. I ordered two tacos and found a HAIR on one of them. When I went back to the bar to let the bartender know he gave me attitude because I found a hair. He proceeded to ask me what he could do to make me happy and then got upset when I asked what could be done. I will not return to this establishment. Terrible service."}
{"text":"My first time will be my last time.  The food was average to good.  The service was slow.  The server would disappear for long periods of time.  They charge for chips and salsa.  There is a kids' play area if you have young kids.  Overall I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"We had a group event at Loco Patron in Tempe this past Friday. Crysta was very helpful arranging it for me. The food was delicious. Our servers were all very friendly. We had a great time there for sure. I had the Baja Burrito - portion size is large. If you want quiet, Friday night with live band is not a good time. But we were aware of the band - and enjoyed the festive, open atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm not normally a fan of the generic Old Town Scottsdale style restaurants and bars like Loco Patron, but I actually do like Loco. Prices are decent, food is good, and wait/bar staff are usually on point."}
{"text":"The food was terrible and salsa was the worst I ever had, very bland and boring. Overall not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Waited 10 MNS at table and no service or even the slightest acknowledgement. Disappointing because I have been before and the food was good.  Too many other options to beg for someone to take your order."}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot. Now, no wonder nobody is ever there. They nickel and dime you. Tiny bowl of chips, about a quarter cup of salsa...if you need more it's $1....no matter how many in your party. If you have six people in your party you get the same amount as someone dining alone.   The real kicker was we had 3 $25 gift certificates. Our bill was $45...they don't give change and you can't use balance for a tip.  So to not lose out we only used one $25 gift card. We have to go back now. And no the gift certificates were not purchased at a discount.   Anyways, bottom line we used to love this place, but this new owner had really ruined the whole concept. :("}
{"text":"Cool place for those who love spicy! Delaney was very accommodating for my taste buds and brought sour cream to tone down the black beans. I'm kinda if a baby when it comes to hot peppers.   Hubby loves watching golf."}
{"text":"My Local spot for tacos and love the staff. They are always taking care of me. Oh and the tacos are great!"}
{"text":"Now I have written some reviews about crappy places in the past but this might be hands down the absolute worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant in my entire life. Now this is incredibly gross so if you cant handle it don't read on. I went to loco patron for lunch like a year ago maybe things have changed. I ordered nothing special from the menu, all in all I would have given it like 2 and a half/ three stars. That is until a giant fucking cockroach crawled out of my food. Needless to say I am traumatized and will not go back there. To be honest I wasn't an asshole about it to the staff in fact I didn't say anything I just got the check and got the hell out of there. Now I have had bad experiences at places before, you know the old \"hair that is obviously not mine in my food\" routine. You know what eventually I am hungry enough that I can forgive that one for the right circumstances, but I will never forgive loco patron for what happened to me. Well don't tell my psychiatrist that she says forgiveness is healthy or some shit like that."}
{"text":"I love the loco patron in Scottsdale.  We were at the one in Tempe and I got a drink but they didn't ask my wife what she wanted.  Then when she did finally ask she was done flirting with some guy, she acted pissed that my wife wanted a frozen drink.   When we went to leave she gave us a bill for $42 for two drinks.  When we said something about it we got  bitched  for complaining about the bill.  So much for the customer is always right.  Some people have know idea how a business makes money.  We was very embarrassed the couple next to us said they would pay our bill!  That was not the issue at all!!"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this new restaurant. Went for Brunch. Our server was nice. I believe her name was (Jordan). She needs a menu test,because she couldn't sell or more importantly describe the dishes we were asking about. I ordered Huevos Rancheros. It took a super long time (40 minutes)to get our food, we even ask Jordan to go check on it. When it came out the eggs were cooked so done you could see the yoke and I had asked and talked to Jordan when ordering that I didn't eat meat. There were two slices of bacon on top :/ They replaced my order with avocado toast - bacon, which was delish. The other meal, traditional breakfast, was good The restaurant has games and cool outside bar, which could make it a fun hangout.  Not sure if I would return for food."}
{"text":"Came for Taco Tuesday with some friends. Server was very friendly, location had a great vibe, and the food came out very quickly in spite of it being busy. The food was delicious, and well priced considering the other options around. I definitely plan to return to explore the menu and other happy hour options that they offer."}
{"text":"Service was Horrible. Too bad because the food wasn't too bad. Waited 10 minutes for our waitress to show up to take our drink order. Twenty five minutes later had to go to the bar to get a plain diet coke. She finally showed up with chips and salsa and 45 minutes to finally get our food after we had to make a second trip to the bar for a couple bottles of beer at which time we were handed the one that had been sitting on the bar waiting for the waitress to pickup. Needless to say no tip."}
{"text":"The tacos are INCREDIBLE!! So happy to live so close to this place! A great choice if you're looking for a good time and amazing music -- go to Loco Patron!!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Old Town location on many occasions.  Tacos and food have been good.  Came to the North Scottsdale location today.  Sliders were good.  My suggestion/complaint...  lower your drink prices!!!  $8 for a pint of Alaskan Amber and $6 for a Coors light is fu____g ridiculous.  Had the house margarita, it was not good and it also was $8.  . The owners had better figure it out.  They have the most expensive beer in North Scottsdale.  They also have buying power with three locations so they obviously think we will all shell out that kind of money for a beer or cocktail.  They are mistaken.  It's called volume people...  Message me when you lower your prices and I will bring the family back...  but not until then.  Not holding my breath."}
{"text":"First time guests and was not impressed. Just another chain low quality restaurant. Told the bar tender it was our first time.. We were looking forward to this place and finally went.. No warm welcome no explanation of the menu no recommendations no interest.. He just gave us standard service and handed us a menu. Margaritas were terrible, chipotle can make a better and stronger margarita. The bartender had no interest as to why I passed off my drink to my partner. The rice was bland and sticky. Over all the experience was not good. When you go to a restaurant and your a new customer, it makes it a better experience when the staff  shows interest in your first time and educates you on what's good. When a server has no interest or concern as to why you don't like something it just shows they don't care. Won't spend my money there again or recommend to friends. I will stick to ma and pa establishments where food and service has integrity. The only thing I enjoyed was my fish taco and refried  beans."}
{"text":"We visited for the second time this morning and left a few minutes after being seated. My family went for my birthday to have brunch. I had decided a week ago, during our first visit, that I wanted to come back to try the brunch menu, which was very appealing.   Our first visit was mediocre. I liked the atmosphere and the patio. The food was 'good' but pretty pricey. On our first visit, we were told that they had changed the happy hour menu and no longer served the items published in the menu and online. This was disappointing. We decided it wouldn't be our new neighborhood spot as we hoped it could be.   Our visit today was even more disappointing. After being seated at a nice little couch/booth on the patio around 10:30am (on Sunday) a server came to greet us. She informed us that they were currently not serving the brunch menu \"for a while\"... meaning indefinitely, I guess.. We left. Fortunately, O.H.S.O. across the street offers a very nice brunch menu and provided us with the celebratory meal we were looking for.   This place obviously cannot deliver what it promises."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff and fun place to watch games or fights at.  Parking garage makes accessibility of the restaurant good too."}
{"text":"I've never written a Yelp review, but I felt compelled to warn people about this place. Maybe they were just having a bad night, but the tables and menus were filthy, the staff was rude and kept walking away before everyone could order or ask questions, and the food just wasn't good. The steak taco meat was cold, and the carne asada fries and tortilla soup sucked too. I would not recommend this place for anyone wanting to eat tacos in Ahwatukee! There were some people here drinking and seemed to be enjoying themselves."}
{"text":"This was my first time here... Came after it was highly recommended by a coworker. She suggested I try their specialty- the pork tacos. Well let's just say this will likely be my last time here. $12 got me two tiny, greasy, tasteless tacos. They were pretty much shredded, bland pork in a super greasy hard shell with shredded iceberg lettuce and a sprinkle of cheese. I asked for the sour cream/guac on the side, but the tacos were  missing the sauce that the menu states is included. They came with a side of cold rice and beans that were also tasteless at best. I would give 0 stars if possible, but the bartender was prompt and friendly!"}
{"text":"This place really needs to train its so called bouncer to recognize when a person is actually intoxicated, my friend and I were waiting for to get in tonight my friend was leaning in the doorway sending a text after working a 14 hour shift the guy said he couldn't let us in cause my friend was drunk. We both were like what the hell are you talking about. I asked for the manager he told me to F off and com back and talk to the manager tomorrow.  I went in found the manager who was extremely busy after waiting 10 min he finally acknowledged me I explained how rude is employee was, he said thank you and went on his way. Warning do not go to this place tired cause there people are poorly trained"}
{"text":"Claudinka was amaaaaazing! Or that's what her mom calls her. Claudia was the best server. Great margaritas its and their burritos.... God yes!!"}
{"text":"Went to Loco Patron on Mill Ave. for the first time this Monday and I have to say it is well worth it! Great food, great drinks, and the bartender, Ang, is amazing! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Really really awesome place with great food and cocktails. Non traditional craft beer which I will be back to try for sure!! Definitely coming back to enjoy their happy hour as well :) very decadent and versatile space they have here!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays are great and excellent prices!! A must go for taco Tuesday!! New favorite place!"}
{"text":"Great mexican food right off of scottsdale blvd. one block from 5th avenue shops. really good place to get some tequila, maragaritas, fajitas and hang with friends outside on the HUGE patio. would def go again! be warned for older people... caters more toward a younger (under 40) crowd. rowdy on sat nights."}
{"text":"We finally stopped in after driving by a hundred times. Great service and food. Very cute setup and ambiance. I don't like many of the Mexican places in Scottsdale so this will be our new go to! Carne Asada waffle fries and crunchy tacos were awesome!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the WCF of the Stanley Cup Playoffs because Cold Beer was at capacity. It wasn't even busy and the bartender ignored myself and multiple other patrons for 20 minutes. What a joke... I left without ordering anything."}
{"text":"I really, really want to like this place. 2 minutes from the house, great games for our daughter, and an amazing patio. But man oh man.... it is impossibly slow. Our waiter was great, but the kitchen continues to be a problem. On a Saturday mid-afternoon where it was not packed our food took forever. Beer gone. Waiting. Snacks gone. Waiting.   We really want this to work but now it has been 3 visits and 3 impossibly long waits.  Please pick it up!!!"}
{"text":"Best wings in town.  Order the salt N pepper wings.  Great service too."}
{"text":"Très bonne ambiance et bon service!  J'ai mon repas du début à la fin.  La salsa servi au début était excellent.  Mes enchilidas au poulet étaient délicieux.  Les portions sont généreuses."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food came out timely and tasted okay. My issues are w/ the portion size I received from the tacos. They were awful. My fish tacos had a pinky sized amount of fish. This is no exaggeration. The rest was filled w/ filler cabbage. I couldn't believe a $14 meal would be so chintzy. The beer wasn't cold enough either. I will never go back to this place until the meals are properly made w/ reasonable portions. How can one justify going to LP for $14 fish tacos when Rubio's offers a much better and bigger portion for $8? It's insane, please fix this immediately!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Love the Arbol sauces, one of the few places to find it. I like the North Scottsdale location more. It's at least worth one visit, lunchtime seems best."}
{"text":"Food here is pretty good. However, I feel that this restaurant may be understaffed when it gets busy at lunchtime. So it takes a while to get our food. So if you have a meeting in an hour, it is a good idea to plan a little bit more time when it is busy lunch time. But if you have time, the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Four words for you: Don't. Believe. The. Hype.   Happy hour on a Friday night seemed like a sure bet for a fun time. Guess again folks.   Music = ear drum busting and sucky Drinks = Margaritas overpriced and underweight Food = Bor-ing Service = Um, hello...is there anyone here? Crowd = The freaks come out at night   I'll give Loco Patron two stars for the drunken monkey antics of  the people out on the patio. At least they were entertaining."}
{"text":"So far, so good. They are a brand new location, but they fit my basic requirements: the food is good, and well-priced. Service was speedy and courteous - almost too courteous, since we were asked if we were doing okay maybe seven times or so. Parking close to this place can be a pain (typical of Mill Ave), but it's a nice and casual spot to unwind for a laid-back lunch. Conveniently right next to a light-rail stop.  It's a typical sports bar meets casual mexican food place. Lots of television screens showing sports games and CNN, a good-sized bar, what looks to be a decent spot for a live DJ (maybe for special events or weekends?), and fun and tacky airbrush decor on the walls of a mexican oasis. I have no opinion on the drinks (since we didn't try any), but once the food arrived (fairly quickly), everything we tried was good. Service was friendly, and the noise level was great at the time we went (mid-day). We found out that they have a punch card, to get a free lunch after you go through five or so. Sounds good to me.  Obviously still a new location that's working out some kinks, but it's off to a good start."}
{"text":"I am a fan of 25 cent Wing Wednesdays!!   After having a few drinks at the Salty Senorita for happy hour we worked out way up the street for Wednesday Wings at Loco Patron.  When my friend said they have 25 cent wings, I grabbed my purse and hurried him along for wings.    He has been a big fan Wednesday wings, he knew what he wanted and ordered them as soon as we sat down...A dozen hot!  I decided to look at the menu and glad I did.  I saw they offered Salt and Pepper wings, plain ol' crispy fried wings seasoned with salt and pepper.  These rocked!!  I ordered a dozen, even my friend was impressed!  The waitress kept the fresh tomato salsa coming with the chips.  Both good and homemade.  I was impressed.  My glass of water was always full and service friendly."}
{"text":"Ada G. and I come here often and she's right on about the salads and the soup. I don't know why we still always order a salad (maybe someday we'll learn), but their margaritas are great, their nachos are awesome and I love their salsa - it's really fresh tasting. So fresh tasting ion fact, I once caught the toddler drinking it straight from the bowl, but hey, it's a vegetable, right?   I have no idea how their \"real food\" is but their happy hour fare is delicious and cheap and that's all I ask."}
{"text":"Really disappointed all around. The service was mediocre at best and it took a significant amount of time to receive any of our order. I ordered the frozen peach margarita, crunchy pork street tacos, and Spanish rice.   Margarita: my margarita was not blended at all--the  syrup, which was room temperature, sat on the bottom of the glass...gross. There was also a disproportional amount of syrup (probably 1/3 was the peach syrup) making my drink very weak. In addition, I asked for my drink to have a salt rim, which it did not.  Tacos: My avocados on top were dry as if they had been sitting out. The pork was overlooked and dry.   Spanish Rice: I never received my rice, which wasn't surprising given the subpar service. The only bonus was that they did not add the rice to my bill.  The only reason I gave this place a 2 instead of a 1 was for the relatively low prices during Happy Hour. I will not dine here again."}
{"text":"Don't let the \"dive\" appearance of this place fool you!  Talk about great food!  The tacos are a \"must try\" and the wings are as good as it gets.  The pablano chicken enchilada is to die for and you must order the queso dip for your chips!!!  Yum!!  Don't forget the margaritas!   All fresh squeezed limes and made perfectly to your taste.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND LOCO PATRON!"}
{"text":"Best Customer Service! Food is phenomenal! Crunchy Pork Taco; can't get more authentic! CONSISTENCY-food and service! Awesome!! Beer cold and best margs!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty fun place to enjoy the beautiful weather AZ has to offer while drinking a delicious margarita under the sun. I met some friends here for Sunday Funday and we made sure tacos and margs where a big part of our outing. Our favorite taco tasted was the crunchy pork taco. It won the best crunchy taco at the Arizona Taco Festival in 2014. Their chips are okay but I do like their salsa.  We also had the carne asada street tacos but we where not impressed at all. Just didn't have that street cart flavor! Lastly, we tried their carne asada fries. It was good, but not deliciously good. I will still come back because I like their patio and people watching!"}
{"text":"Are waitress Erika was awesome ! First time here had a great experience !! Cheers to Erikanice place cool !!we will come back .we are from Cali !!"}
{"text":"Greatest tacos in the valley! After I moved to Arizona I started to love Mexican food. This place makes the best tacos in valley. And service is awesome too."}
{"text":"taco Tuesday is always a plus, but if you can make it during happy hour, you're able to try multiple things for a great price. Their wings are delicious, even though it is a Mexican place, I also like their breakfast French toast is delicious, they'bacon is crisp and their,margarita is our delicious. If you go during happy hour, you can get a jumbo margarita for 13 dollars who can beat that"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon and was able to be seated immediately in a booth. We originally only arrived with 3 people, but the party grew to 5 and the booth was able to accommodate the size.   Our waitress was friendly and attentive, great service. As we sat down we were served chips and salsa. The vibe is very casual, indoor and outdoor seating available, and sports were playing on each television.  Everyone ordered margaritas and after tasting the different various varieties, I definitely think the original is the best.  I ordered the two-taco deal, fish and beef, and both were so great.   I do not live in Phoenix, but I definitely want to return here when I am back in town."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a lunch break with a co-worker for their taco Tuesday specials. We should have listened to the reviews. While the deals were great and the tacos were delicious, the other issues were just too much.  First of all the service is terribly slow. You're lucky if you get a drink refill. The tacos, like I said, were good, but good luck getting the ones you ordered or with the proper toppings. I got completely different tacos than I ordered and my co-worker got a taco with avocado in it which he told the service he couldn't eat because he was allergic. When the waitress brought the taco up to the cook and told him about the mess up with the avocado we saw him laughing about it behind the counter.  Halfway through our meal our first waitress just stopped coming to the table so we had another server come around and help and she was great, but still it was very bizarre.  If you go don't expect to get good service or the meal you actually ordered. I won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"i really like loco patron! they have bomb fish tacos and their margaritas are really good too! im not sure what kind of flavoring thing they use but it's really sweet so you can get a skinny version margarita and it's still delish!   service is decent. they are quick with the waters and chips and salsa when u sit down. food comes out quickly too.   great happy hour and lunch specials. big fan of loco patron"}
{"text":"Love your Taco Tuesdays! I go about every week. Servers are always very friendly and food comes out pretty quick."}
{"text":"Great little hang out spot thay doesnt carry the pretentious Scottsdale vibe. Oh, and litterally the best chicken wings in AZ!!! Who would have thought? Amazeballs!"}
{"text":"I am not from Arizona, but was in town for an event and stumbled upon this place while exploring. We wandered in because it looked busy and everyone seemed to be having a good time.   It has an indoor and outdoor area as most restaurant/bars do here. You can sit at the bar, or they have booths and tables both inside and out. Most people seem just to stand around though  Not a bad crowd but seemed a little on the older side, but maybe it was just that particular day we went.  Decent priced drinks and food. We tried a few items (tacos, fries, onion rings) and they were alright. Typical bar food, nothing really to write home about.  Id stop back in here next time I visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Best wings in town. The salt and pepper wings are delicious. 6 for 5 or 12 for 10.  The chips and sales are very good as well."}
{"text":"This is a great bar! Love Taco Tuesday! Came here tonight (Saturday) , and also enjoyed the service that Rachel provided more than anything. She was super nice and totally made me and my kiddos feel welcomed and like family. She is a rare find and a reason I would come back. Thank you Rachel for being great! Go get em! Steve"}
{"text":"I've been to Loco Patron in Tempe several times so I was excited to take my family to a location closer to us. It was all downhill from there.   The place was pretty lively and had music which was cool but way too loud. It was tough to talk to the person 2 seats away.   Then I took a look at the menu and it was COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from the Tempe location. I mean seriously a customer shouldn't be taken completely off guard. I had raved about the AZ Burrito for days leading up to this visit. But this location doesn't sell any burritos? But you serve pizza? Is this not a TexMex restaurant?   Oh well we decided to give it a shot. I ordered a 2 taco plate and wanted to mix match pork and shrimp. They are the exact same price. Server told me no they don't do that. Wow. I should have left then.  I get over it and ordered a pitcher of margarita. I finished the entire pitcher myself and got a slight buzz before I realized it's been a full hour and we still haven't received our food. The server realized we were frustrated so they brought a basket of chips for free. (Mind you in Tempe you get chips as soon as you sit down and they're always free)  I gave it 2 stars because the food was good. But I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying loco patron in Tempe and old town is my favorite Mexican place to eat so when I heard there was a loco patron brewery going in my backyard I couldn't be happier. If you go there expecting the same menu you will be disappointed... also the chips and salsa (which are 5+ dollars) are not even close to the same salsa as the other 2 locations it's like a jar of pace salsa. As a mexican restaurant in north Scottsdale charging PREMIUM prices you should never be serving margaritas on draft.. that's my biggest pet peeve.. you can do better than that!!! And as everyone else has already said the service is SLLLLOW! I was so bummed after trying this place twice and giving it a shot it's way too overpriced and not even close to worth the value. It's absolutely nothing like the other 2 loco patrons. :("}
{"text":"I went here only because we had a 90% off Restaurant.com Coupon and I'm glad I didn't actually pay full price. The food was so mediocre that I determined that they don't put much effort into the food because they assume that the people eating here are already so wasted that they won't notice. Not a fan..."}
{"text":"I'm very impressed with the effort the employees make to ensure a great experience.  We ordered several happy hour items & hamburger.  The hamburger was not quite cooked according to the order but it was quickly corrected.  The rest of the items were perfect. Wonderful experience on a busy weekend night."}
{"text":"Yum!!! We are from out of town and have frequented a number of places in Scottsdale and this is by far the best in the area for Mexican food!! AWESOME chips and salsa, fish tacos and shrimp tacos! We debated for a long time about where to go to dinner (I'm picky) and I wish we would have just come straight here! You will love it!"}
{"text":"The food was good....!  Not a college bar like we expected.  Service was great, right down to the Busboys....Ryan and some blonde dude who asked us if we needed anything (right at the appropriate time, like it was on cue.)   Great customer service.  Totally would eat there again."}
{"text":"They have amazing food along with a wonderful staff! This is the best place for taco Tuesday! I would recommend it to everyone"}
{"text":"We went to Scottsdale on the fly because our original vacation was canceled due to weather in Atlanta. However, coming to Scottsdale was a great idea! We were seriously craving some excellent Mexican food and found it at Loco Patron.   We sat at the bar outside and grabbed margaritas to start. YUM. The BEST fish tacos and ceviche I have EVER had. Now this is coming from someone whom has had the same 2 dishes in various parts ofMexico so this is a very strong opinion. But the Corona battered fried fish tacos were fantastic - complete with an avocado type sauce on the top of the tacos completed all of the flavors.   Great service and fantastic food!!!  To add to our trip for Spring Training this year, 2011, we were able to get 2 yummy doses of fried shrimp tacos, ceviche and margaritas. HEAVEN. We literally crave these tacos until we can go back to Scottsdale. Nightlife is also jumping on the outdoor patio and it's very lively. Buckets of beer = $15 for 5. Not too shabby!"}
{"text":"Loco Patron is awesome! We absolutely love going to Happy Hour and Taco Tuesday's! The crowd is always lively, the music is great, and the tacos and house margaritas are even better! I promise you will be happy with the service and the good eats! The crunchy fish and steak tacos are my favorite. Give Loco Patron a shot if you haven't yet...."}
{"text":"Being an airline crew member, I end up in the same cities at the same nearby restaurants over and over.  And this place is no exception.  I LOVE the cheese enchiladas...with both red and green sauce. No complaints about the food.  My service (Alicia) was okay, but not great And I watched while other tables had terrible service.  One man at another table actually had to get up and go and find his waitress.  The waitstaff is cute young girls.  They stand around their ordering computer screen and bullshit.  They cuss.  They flip their hair.  They talk girly stuff.  But they seldom pay attention to their tables.  And they pay ZERO attention to the not-so-good-looking young Hispanic guy bussing and cleaning their tables for them.....he spoke to me, and I spoke to him.  They do, however, pay a lot of attention to the big muscle boys working behind the bar.  So, yeah, food is fine.  Service feels weird.  Girly.  Young.  Inexperienced.  Shallow."}
{"text":"Minus the A I would say it's OK. For what it is, Loco Patron does a few things alright by me. They have a great beer selection on tap, and sitting at the outdoor bar in good weather is primo. Food is prepared quickly, so this is a decent option for the \"I'm starving and need to eat now\" or the \"I just need some tacos, here's $10.\"   First of all, why has the free chips & salsa courtesy disappeared from so many places?This salsa isn't my favorite, but it's passable and on the house. I've tried an array of the seafood tacos and liked the mahi mahi best. The lobster was pretty bad - tasted like surimi (fake crab + tacos = grimace) - and the shrimp taco was uber sweet for my taste though some people may like that. The smashed potatoes were a bit bland, but the black beans were super delicious. If you're a corn tortilla lover, I think they do them well here.   I don't see the need to comment on the waitstaff, as I have pretty low expectations for this type of place and it's location on Mill. Quick tacos with at least one good option plus decent craft beer is what warrants 3 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Melissa our server was great! Great music. Solid tacos. Exactly what you want out of a taco Tuesday. Would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"The place is amazing. Great atmosphere, great food and great drinks.  The pork belly tacos were incredible and the Fudido was delicious.  Besides awesome Margaritas and wide beer selection the Loco Patron \"Codigo\" House Tequila was some of the best Tequila I've tasted.    The men's room is very unique with half keg urinals and the indoor and outdoor spaces are a pleasant and fun atmosphere.  The service was also great."}
{"text":"Bad. The overall experience was mediocre at first, disappointing in the end. First of all, when you get in, no one greets you. \"Do I seat myself anywhere? Yes.\" So I first sat on the patio waiting for my boyfriend, then we moved to the bar. The blonde bartender is mostly why I have to give one star to this place. No smile, no enthusiasm. Way too many tattoos to display. Her shorts were the classic night-club type. Her cleavage showed too much. I understand it's a casual place, but during the day that's not what employees should wear, in my opinion. It took awhile before she asked for drinks and she didn't even come back to take the food order. The manager took our order. My boyfriend wanted some sweetener for his iced tea and he asked for some sugar or simple syrup. Now I used to be a bartender too so I know you guys have simple syrup. But apparently cordiality is something she doesn't know about. A first bad impression, don't you think?  Food: I'm not a connoisseur of the Mexican cuisine nor a big fan on it, but my beef enchiladas were not good. The chili sauce was too spicy and had no flavor. My boyfriend, who knows better Mexican food, agreed with me. His tacos were good though. Even the dessert we had, I don't remember the name of it, perhaps sopaipillas, was good for me cause it was the first time I had it. But again, my partner didn't find it good at all. Cleanliness of the place was another turn down. The chairs were dirty, the salt and pepper all greasy. Who knows how many people with dirty hands have touched those salt and pepper before us.   Concluding we won't come back. You people should learn what good customer service with a professional appearance is like."}
{"text":"Okay this was a slower Monday night but we walked right in, sat down, waitress brought us chips and salsa, got our drinks, took our order, got us our food in no time! Food and drinks were wonderful! We had shrimp fajitas, the AZ burrito, and enchiladas! All so good! We also enjoyed some Strawberry Margaritas that hit the spot! Comfortable but fun place, great vibe, great service! Only in town a couple days and my entire group said they would like to come back tomorrow for dinner again!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Loco since 2009 and the experience has been nothing short of awesome, every single time. Their salsa is world class and a benchmark for every Mexican restaurant I've visited since I first started coming here. If you're looking for an all-around good time, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Love how chill this place is. They have such good margaritas!!! I love sitting on the patio when the weather is nice! Definitely recommend this place even if it's to go grab one or five margaritas:)"}
{"text":"Finally, a great Mexican food restaurant and fun place to hang out in the 85260 neighborhood. The mahi tacos are excellent and the staff is fun and friendly unlike other Mexican food establishments in the hood. I will definitely hang out here."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect place for what you expect from a Mexican grill....great tacos, margaritas & cold beers. I love their chips & salsa, and they wait staff is always good about making sure you have plenty of it. After the chips & salsa I usually get the black & pepper wings, which are excellent. You wouldn't expect good wings at a Mexican food place, but they're really good here. For my main dish their hard shelled tacos are the best, but I've had several other things and it's always consistent. Lunch or dinner this is a great quick casual Mexican food spot.  Although I do like their food the best thing about this place is the atmosphere or more specifically the patio. If it's Spring Training time or if it's nice out during the day it's hard to beat this place. Grab a cold Corona & kick it on the patio in the sun!"}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE!!!! Went there with a friend. It took over 15 minutes just to get drinks.   I ordered fish and shrimp tacos. They were so over seasoned they were inedible! I was just going to write it off, but my friend insisted we say something.   The server recommended a salad which she said was her go to when she worked. Again, it was drowning in dressing and seasoning. I left starving!   Do not go to this place at all, it is disgusting. We should have just went to Taco Bell, the quality would have been 100x's better!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, perfect tasting drinks and fun atmosphere.  Looking for a mouth watering restaurant in Tempe?  Stop here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Margarita?  Whoa this place has a reputation that it does not deserve.    Food is ordinary and inexpensive, but the margaritas are overpriced and make no sense when the beer is so much cheaper here.  Young stuck up Millennial 20 somethings hang out here and it is almost as if this place got transplanted off Mill Ave. into Scottsdale, or maybe it's just the Scottsdale ASU kids that go here because they live close by in Scottsdale with mommy and daddy.  Can be loud, with limited seating, and parking is a pain here as well."}
{"text":"This place just becomes more dilapidated as the years go by... The owners are doing nothing to keep up with it."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience. We have been here a handful of times before, and always had something incorrect or service issues. This was ridiculous. First, the service and the food was awful. Our server clearly didn't care and she was training a new employee! Prices are high for the quantity and quality served, such as $16.95 for 3 Taco Bell size tacos that are underseasoned and underwhelming. In contrast, the fish bites were so salty, they were almost inedible. They brought me the wrong salad. I didn't realize it until the guy walked away. I thought I would try it, but the strawberry dressing they brought was disgusting. I waited almost 18 minutes before our server came to the table. I told her the salad was wrong and the dressing was awful. She said it was wrong and would have them make another one. I told her I did not want to wait and everyone else was well into their meals. She said OK and left. Someone brought me different dressing, but I did NOT like that salad. When she brought the check, we were still charged for the $16.95 salad that she even pointed out I didn't eat. I am SO SICK of having to beg for a manager when there is an issue that the server is CLEARLY aware of. This time, we paid the bill and left. We will write reviews and tell everyone we know about our rotten experiences at this restaurant instead."}
{"text":"Used to come here a lot for taco Tuesday and for their \"good pricing\", but I will never be returning to this restaurant. The service is terrible, slow, and almost everyone seems upset to work there... Not only that, last time I was there I paid with cash and had all my change taken by the waitress and was told my receipt was \"unable to be found\". Pure bull shit, will never go back."}
{"text":"Fish taco was awesome and the steak was ok.  5 beers for $15 was a deal.  Nice atmosphere and live DJ!  Would do it again but stick with the fish taco! Oh the wings were good!"}
{"text":"Loco is one of my go-to spots in Old Town. I probably visit once a week, at least for their Taco Tuesday. I crave their chips and salsa on a daily basis. I don't know what they do to it but it's so fresh. SO FRESH.  You can't go wrong with much of anything on their menu but my favorites are their steak tacos and protein bowl. Even their house margaritas are good, they taste nothing like the electric yellow mix crap you see in grocery stores. Overall for pricing and quality/freshness of food you get it doesn't get better  The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because service is really hit or miss. My bf and I are honestly one of the lowest maintenance tables you could have, seriously you won't see us looking at a stopwatch to see exactly how minutes went by before waters are refilled, but we've had a few experiences where our server has disappeared forever.  With that being said, food and drinks always comes out super quick even when they're busy!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Hubs and I went on a Tuesday night and the place was packed! Taco Tuesdays are on fire there. My husband ordered 6 tacos and some ceviche, and I ordered the shrimp fajitas- no tortillas. Made a salad out of mine and every bite was yummy. The only downside that I noticed was that the torta is no longer on the menu. Too bad since it was so good the last time we were there. Definitely recommend, and will be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Loco Patron a handful of times, the food and service have always been mediocre at best. The only thing it has going for it, is that, it is dead on Thursday nights to watch Thursday night football.  This past Thursday (12/4/14) was no expectation. Let me just say, that I have been in the service industry my whole adult life. I've done everything from washing dishes,  hosting, serving, and bartending. I get it. Off days happen. I don't think this was the case.  Our server was....awful. She barely acknowledged us and was inconvenienced to tell us what beers were on draft. When our good arrived, 75% of the orders were wrong. Instead of shredded beef, we all got ground beef. Not a big deal. I'm still going to eat it, but she never came by to ask how everything was. We sat there with empty beer glasses and greasy ground beef. When she saw that we were finished with our food, she handed us our tab and never cleared the table. We paid our bill and apparently she couldn't wait for us to leave to pick up the back book. She opened it up in front of us before we even had a chance to sign the slip. I have NEVER written a bad review before and NEVER tipped less the 20%. I just think that bad service and attitudes shouldn't be enabled. Oh and I forgot to mention the ear piercing full bass techno music that was playing  during the game. Sure it's the bears and the cowboys, I personally could care less, but those are somebody else's teams that want to hear what's going on.  Come on Loco Patron, get it together!"}
{"text":"Ive been to Loco once when it wasn't a Tuesday, but other than that I only go on Tuesday Nights... and by only, I mean every Tuesday.  My family and I go to Loco every Tuesday.  Kelsey and one other lady (im sorry I forget your name) are always our waitress.  Kelsey is awesome, I want to be friends with her! ha!  They always remember what we order.  I used to always get a margarita (one of the best frozen margaritas I have had at a restaurant) until I went on a health kick.  The atmosphere is awesome, they owners are always there checking in with people, and everyone is super friendly.  Tuesday nights are packed, luckily we get there early.    Food: I always have chicken, steak and fish tacos! Ha! I don't mess around.  Chicken tacos are $1 on Tuesdays, steak and fish are $2.  What a deal!! I have also had their wings, which are phenomenal at a Mexican restaurant! Definitely try their pretzel sticks at least once with the queso, also another fave!   Loco gets loud on Tuesday, everyone is there for a good time!! This place is great for families, since its in Ahwatukee.  And the service is fantastic!  Can't speak for any other nights, but Tuesday is definitely Poppin!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best tacos I've ever had!! The girls are so sweet & everyone is so attentive. & The patio is always packed. I have been going every Taco Tuesday for $2 tacos and $5 margaritas and I'm never disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for work happy hours and the food and atmosphere are just meh. There are a lot better places to go on Mill Ave. They do have a good variety of food specials on their happy hour menu but they are all basically just greasy bar food. It's not exactly authentic Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite mexican food restaurants and the food is always awesome, but service is hit or miss. Our server today was not friendly, didn't smile once, nor did she even introduce herself. Kinda ruined our entire vibe as we felt like we were bothering her."}
{"text":"Great build out.... that's about it!! Unfortunately service wasn't very good.  The chicken was over cooked on one side and barely cooked on the other. The staff is poorly trained  with zero menu knowledge"}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour deals, delicious food, friendly and patient staff, overall a great place to get some Mexican food."}
{"text":"Our favorite Taco Tuesday spot!! Naked pork taco and naked mahi mahi tacos are the best."}
{"text":"Becky's combo plate with the beef taco and enchilada were fantastic.  Lots of food.   Mild salsa was the only negative.  I had the holiday brat which was awesome.  Nice place."}
{"text":"Food is decent. My only complaint are the chips. You receive a small basket of chips and a very small ceramic container of salsa. I would guess there is about 1/4 cup of salsa at best. Every time you ask for more, they charge $1. If you feel like you need to have portion control, how about putting endless chips and salsa on the menu like other restaurants do (Chili's, The Islands Burger Restaurant... etc)."}
{"text":"Wish I could rate negative stars.... With so many bar choices this place is by far the worst.  Last Saturday a group of friends went out for a friend's birthday celebration in Scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at Loco Patron. It was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early. We finished our last call drinks and started to head out. The friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom. At this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave. My friend started to explain his reason for not leaving (friends still in bathroom) but was quickly cut off. I watched from the patio as the two bouncers (both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend) quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out. As he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him. The bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment, pinned him down with their elbows and hit him. At this point I had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him. I had already taken out my phone to call 911 and I quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force. We demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request. He swiped my friend's phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground. Several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive. The police arrived and took down the bouncers' information and stated that they would be recording this incident.   I am absolutely adamant in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever frequent Loco Patron again. We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening, non physical patrons of their establishment. Based on the behavior of the two bouncers I assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves. What I witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and I plan on writing any regulatory agency I can think of. These people make a bad name for all of the bouncers out there that conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law."}
{"text":"Well I wrote an update for this restaurant, but somehow it got deleted.  Since some time has passed, this update will be kinder.  Loco, Loco... you're one of the only close bar/restaurants to my house.  Can you please up your game?  FOOD: Refer to the pictures I've posted, which show a very creative description of Smashed Potatoes, which in reality are neither crunchy on the outside, nor creamy on the inside as the menu would have you believe.  A handful of small red potatoes that are deep fried (with a somewhat crunchi-ER outside than, say, a baked potato) and maybe smacked with the bottom of a pan or a mallet is definitely not worth what you're charging.  And that brings me to the next category:  SERVICE: When we mentioned to the waitress that the potatoes we received were NOT AT ALL what we expected due to the creative menu writing, she didn't offer to take them back or off our bill.  What she did offer was to have them remade... the same way.  She said she'd never read the description so she wasn't sure what they were supposed to be.  VALUE: They charge too much for their kids menu items, which don't even include a drink.  For what the kids get, the items should be 1/2 price.  Many local restaurants offer better values for kids (eg. Pita Jungle's $5 meal includes a drink and a well-balanced meal).  I know this is a BAR, but this is also Ahwatukee.  Many people have kids coming to dinner with them... especially before 7pm.  At least include a drink.  For two adults and one child not drinking alcohol, the bill was just under $40 with tip.  That included a coupon for 50 cent wings.  One inferior app, One kids quesadilla, $12 worth of wings and three sodas should not be close to $40.  For that money, I could go to plenty of other places and be happier with my meal.  :)  In conclusion, I won't be going to eat at Loco again unless someone drags me during one of their happy hours.  Their grilled wings are delicious, but it's just not worth it for me."}
{"text":"Fun place to grab some drinks that is fairly reasonably priced.  Usually we go with a group and although we are loud, we always try to be courteous and ensure our waiter/ess aren't too annoyed with us.  The couple times we have been here it has been the same and the service was good and I say good because during happy hour how often do you want someone to come by? Once they saw our drinks low, they would ask us, basically what you want in a HH service."}
{"text":"We stopped in last minute as we were waking around Oldtown. As soon as we got there, it happened to be happy hour which was great. The tacos were AMAZING no added salsa required. We also ordered the AZ burrito which was gigantic and delicious. Overall, great atmosphere, great food and no complaints."}
{"text":"New Location!   This place is close to work so me and the co-workers stopped in.    Good:  Location and staff looked really busy/hard working....decently cheap drinks and food.    Bad:  They were out of about 25% of the menu/unprepared and the food just wasn't that good.  I feel sorry for people that come to AZ and have \"Mexican Food\" at places like this.  Even the rice and beans (simple things) are just mediocre and have no character.    I'm getting the vibe this is definitely more of a \"drink\" spot than a \"food\" spot.  After a few drinks...maybe everything will taste better!   This place needs a little time to get its act together. I'm hopeful."}
{"text":"I recently went to Loco Patron with a friend. I thought the food was excellent. The staff members were very friendly and helpful. They kept our drinks refilled and were very attentive.   I like the large TVs that have various games on display. That is a nice touch and adds to the atmosphere.  The one thing I didn't like is that things get really noisy. I was shouting most of the night just to talk to the person I went with. I couldn't hear everything he was saying to me so I had to keep asking him to repeat himself. I felt kind of bad about that.  It's not really Loco Patron's fault. Things tend to get rowdy at any place there is a bar/ alcohol is served. It did make talking to the people I was with kind of difficult though.  If not for the noise, I would definitely rate Loco Patron five stars. I just have to take one off because it was hard for me to talk to my friends and it got kind of frustrating through the night. I'm not sure if there is anything they can do about it. It's probably more of a personal preference more than anything else.  Other than that, I really enjoyed my experience at Loco Patron. I will definitely be going back again. I think next time I will sit in their outdoor area however to avoid the noisy atmosphere inside."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Loco Patron while doing the tourist thing - or in other words, walking in circles! We were famished and dehydrated, so when I pulled up the reviews on Yelp and saw the ratings- we were bummed out. We walked away, but something told us to go back and boy were we glad!! Everything was so good & flavorful. The service was excellent, our waitress had the best sense of humor ever - it's too bad I forgot her name (oops). And, the music was awesome until some youngins showed up and put a few dollars in the juke box. It's definitely a great place and we will definitely return to try other items on the menu. Ahh, and one more thing - their margaritas are awesome. All of them, because if I recall correctly we at least had 4 different ones."}
{"text":"Stumbled here on a late Saturday night as this was the only place that was still serving food. Being from Vegas, it's something hard to get used to. My group and I walked in shortly after midnight and advised the kitchen was closing in 10. The place was empty with the exception of one other group. Initial drinks took a while to get to us but the wait for the food was well worth it! Only thing I would suggest to the restaurant is that they should have actual flavorful salsa made from scratch and not the typical Tapatio or Cholula. Strange to come to a \"Mexican\" restaurant/cantina and it not be an option."}
