{"text":"My boyfriend and I had the pleasure of visiting metropolitan restaurant once again. Since the weather was great, we sat on the intimate patio. The service was amazing and the staff, as welcoming as ever! Steven always makes us feel welcomed and well taken care of :)"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Metropolitan for probably 10 years, enjoying both the inside vibe and especially the patio. I have been there twice in the past week, as a matter of fact.  The food and wine have always been solid, not exceptional, but service has been great and I love that you can actually have a conversation without being drowned out by others or loud music. Previously, I would have given a 4 star rating  but down graded after a disappointing experience tonight. I ordered a bocconini and proscuitto salad on arugula. Arugula is a pretty hardy green that lasts for a long time, so I was surprised that about 1/3 of the leaves were actually slimy. I ate the bocconini and proscuitto and then realized how bad the arugula was. I pointed it out to the server who apologized and gave me a small green salad instead. The bill arrived with the full $16 price for the original salad from a new server. I mentioned to her that I had sent it back and she said that the proscuitto and bocconini were very expensive so she could only give me 50% off. It really isn't about the $8 but the principle and the way it was handled. Not a good way to retain loyal clientele!"}
{"text":"Ah, Metropolitan. This remains one of my favorite lunchtime hideaways. Nice atmosphere, friendly and fast service, good food.   My colleagues recently hosted a farewell party for me here and I had the veal schnitzel with arugula salad. Not a frequent veal eater, but I really enjoyed it (despite one of my colleagues trying to make me feel bad that it probably never saw the sun). Lots of beer and wine to choose from.   Their calzones and fish dishes are good too. Thin crust margherita pizza is a hit as well.   Bathrooms are clean. Separate bills are easily accommodated. Never been on the patio but it's a great little spot facing a courtyard with fountains and sculptures so you don't get exhaust fumes or people trying to sell you roses.   We came back a few hours later."}
{"text":"Found this place last night when walking to the Sony Centre for a show, looking for a quick bite beforehand. About 730pm on a Friday and only 3 people in the bar. Music level was good, not too loud, perfect for still being able to have a conversation with your friends. We ordered the chicken wings and the spring rolls, both of which were excellent. Service was attentive without being overbearing, and the drinks and food came out promptly. When we paid for our bill, we received $20 too much change. We spoke to the waitress and both women on staff confirmed we had given them an extra $20 by mistake. This was very honest of them and we appreciated it. (Those new $20 bills...we checked them but obviously not closely enough!) A great find in an area without too many options, looking forward to visiting this place again soon."}
{"text":"Booked a business lunch from website.  No confirmation by email and when I called, staff took awhile to find my reservation. Service was prompt.  When we ordered lamb shank, was advice it wasn't available?  Why is it on the menu?!! My pasta dish was bland. I asked for fresh cheese to be grated, waitress pointed me to powdered cheese on the table! We asked what was available for desert. We were given 5 option, one was a chocolate cake.  5 of us ordered it only to be told only 1 piece was available.  The resto wasn't full and our lunch started at 12.  WTF? Won't be going back."}
{"text":"We had lunch here during TIFF. Nice patio with great water features. Food was ok but nothing special. Service was good."}
{"text":"Well we tried to eat here.  Walked in at 10 (they close at midnight) and asked if the kitchen was open.  Was told it was.  Sat down and ordered some drinks.  Drinks came, tried to order and was told the kitchen closes at 10:30.  Not a problem, since it's 10:14 right? Wrong! Kitchen closes early on \"slow nights\".    Long story short they lied to bamboozle us into buying drinks with no intention of ever feeding us.  You kind of have to respect it honestly. But yeah, won't be back."}
{"text":"Had a work Xmas lunch here today...was not too happy with the overpriced menu with hardly any selection. The place looks nice, but the tables are far too small, it was loud..and if you have a party of 6 or more people, no separate bills. I decided to try the prosciutto and arugula pizza with pesto. It was alright, but not very filling, and hardly any asiago cheese, and no other cheese, just a bunch of arugula, and a few paper thin slices of Prosciutto. Everyone else complained that the plates were huge, but the portions were way too small. Especially for the price! My pizza was $18..I didn't buy a drink, and ended up paying $25 for my personal pizza, as they tacked the 18% gratuity to the bill. Needless to say, I will never bother going there again. It isn't horrible, but definitely not worth the high price. My boss apologized afterward, we only went there as she had booked last minute, and most places had no more room to get reservations."}
{"text":"I came here for after work drinks on a Friday and couldn't believe how empty the patio was. People in the financial district don't know this place exists. The cobblestone patio is very quaint and overlooks a courtyard with sculptures and fountains. The wine was good and decently priced and the panko crusted calamari served with creamy tzatziki was delicious (and $10).   That said, a vodka martini will set you back $15 (with no warning) and the server might take your glass away before you finish it. That was a NO-NO. She also forgot our cutlery. Annoying. The final straw was the bathroom: I walked in to a toilet full of urine with the seat up (thanks, dude, whoever you are). The staff should really be checking this, especially since no one else was in the restaurant at the time.   Therefore, my review diminishes from a fantastic 4 to a mediocre 3. Happy hour will be happier elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent hidden gem with a quint and peaceful outdoor patio in the heart of the financial core. Dishes are superb and made with love as if it's coming outa moms kitchen :)"}
{"text":"Can I say that I'd been working across the street from the Metropolitan for ages, and until I got invited out by a co-worker for an \"I-know-it's-only-Tuesday-but-if-I-don't-get-out-of-here-soon-there-will-be-blood-stains-in-my-cubicle\" drink, I never knew it existed.  Post-work, there appear to be folks filtering in from the office for a quick pint, a glass of wine, and a conversation about work, how good it is, or in our case, wondering which beam in the office ceiling would hold our weight.  Instantly, the glass of Stella and the glass of Merlot hit the table.  I could see instantly why she picked this place, as the dark richness of the wood and décor provide a sharp contrast to the Vitamin-D-draining light of most office buildings.  Settling into the chairs, you feel way more relaxed than when you came in, feeling the distance between ears and shoulders increasing.  In the summer, a semi-secluded back patio is available, allowing you to be sheltered from traffic, and enjoy a bit of the summer warmth.  The staff are efficient and friendly, confident in the menu, but satisfied with people just needing a drink and light snack.  A range of Italian offerings await you, with entrées running in the $18.00 to $25.00 range, and worth the reasonable expense.  The Metropolitan has surprised me on two levels, not the least of which was me going \"What, were you always here?\""}
{"text":"This is a solid choice for work lunches or after-work dinners. It's all about location, location, location. Food is decent but it's not a destination menu. The courtyard setting is unbeatable in warm weather - there are not many other downtown patios located next to fountains (and not a busy street). After being here several times with a group, I can heartily recommend most of their menu items. Prices aren't bad for this area and the pizza is especially generous. Reservations are never a problem - even for a large group - and they've always done their best to split the bill as needed. Really accommodating. I've never eaten inside but I expect to be back. Bathrooms could use some work/cleaning to avoid slipping into pub status."}
{"text":"Metropolitan has now become my new favourite place for the best pasta sauce in Toronto. Their menu isn't all that big and the place isn't all that large, but the food is awesome.  I had the Sausage Penne  and I was instantly impressed by how authentic the pasta sauce was. To make it even more amazing was the fact the pasta was gluten free.  I also had an order of the beef back ribs; again, amazing. They were tasty, meaty, and not full of gristle like some beef ribs are.  The manager was also very gracious, attentive, and punctual.  All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"I love this spot! It's a hidden gem in the Financial District. The service is always prompt and amazing, the food is excellent and their outdoor patio is perfect in this weather and great for people watching. My co workers and I are regulars at this place and the staff treat us to the occasional complimentary round of drinks, know all of our names and always greet us with big smiles.  Eric the manager is a doll and truly cares about his customers experience at the restaurant. I can't say enough good things about this place and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants an enjoyable dining experience, or an awesome place to hang out and have some drinks"}
{"text":"This place is 5 stars because it's: - very quiet on a weeknight - excellent service (especially in this snobby area, no offence) - basic list of draught beers. It's all I come here for - food is alright, it's okay. Can't complain. Pricey for the \"okay\" food. - quiet patio, nobody walks there -because it's not on a major street! I love it!  There's a dinner menu as well as a bar (appetizer) menu. They usually hand out the bar menu after 5, so if you're hungry, ASK FOR THE DINNER MENU.  Okay so here's some upsetting aspects about this place, however I've visited here a few times. I loved each and every single time. During lunch hour, it's very likely you'll get a table. Even on the patio. The service is decently fast, not rushed but not financial district quick. I like that.  OK, YES, UPSETTING ASPECTS: - tables on the patio are extremely tight/small. Big people: do not come here. - this place closes at midnight 12 (which is so early), but we were kicked out at 11:50. Seriously!! My conversation HAS NOT ENDED yet - the food, really, is \"just ok\". The calamari is not good.  Still I LOVE coming here!!  **UPDATE the chicken pizza is actually pretty good!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today....the Moroccan Chicken was good...my peer had the Prosciutto Pizza that looked delicious...will be back"}
