{"text":"Quiet place on a Saturday afternoon. Went here to watch a Montreal Canadiens game. The waitress changed the channel for us, turned the music lower and the tv volume up. Good service, good nachos !"}
{"text":"One afternoon my co-workers and I went out for a quick lunch. We wanted to sit out in the patio because it was a nice day, so chose this smaller pub in hopes that it wasn't already packed from the lunch crowd. Spirits ended up being the perfect place.   This place has it all. They serve brunch, lunch, and dinner, and have an awesome stocked bar. Because I was here for a weekday lunch with the co-workers I didn't end up ordering drinks, but looking through the drink menu I noticed they had an extensive beer list on tap. Even draft Strongbow! Obviously the beer offerings were no match to that of Beer Bistro or other specialized restaurants, but for a tiny pub its not too bad.    \"Chicken Avocado Club\" ($12.99) -Grilled chicken breast, crispy prosciutto, avocado, swiss cheese, lettuce and tomato:  I'm a pretty big avocado fanatic, so whenever I see it being offered in sandwiches, wraps or whatever else, I always get suckered into ordering it. I can't resist the creamy avocado goodness! The Chicken Avacado Club was quite satisfying and was well balanced in textures -a nice crunch from the prosciutto, a creamy avocado, freshness from the tomato, and warm gooey melted swiss cheese. The only thing is I wish the bun was toasted.  Roast Beef Dip ($12.99):  My coworker ordered the beef dip, and it looked and smelled so amazingly delicious. Not sure how it tastes, but my mouth is watering just looking at it. Will definitely order it next time I come!   Overall a nice place to grab a quick lunch. The patio is small but comfortable, server was friendly, and food was decent. With their selection of beer and liquors, I think this would also make a great place to grab drinks after work as well!"}
{"text":"This a fantastic place for a fun get-together . Food is great, service great, owner is great- and they have kareoke on Saturday night."}
{"text":"Avoid if you can. There are much better bars in the area than this place.  The service here is absolutely terrible. After not knowing where my party was upon arrival, I was met with a waitress who had such a condescending attitude. She was very rude and unhelpful - and quite frankly, didn't seem to care despite our party being quite large and helping this place pay their bills. Strike one. Oh, and tip for those who actually want to try this place: order your drink at the bar, because the waiters take FOREVER to come to the patio. Not that the bartenders are any better in attitude, but at least you'll get your drink as soon as you walk in. Strike two.  As if that was not bad enough, one of our colleagues had to ask the waiter THREE times for his bill. Yes, the waiter forgot twice to bring his bill. Strike 3. How is this place getting better reviews here? I don't get it.  The final straw came when I asked how to get to the back patio (I was at the front patio). The waitress instructed me to go all the way to the back and turn left. I did that, when I turned left, I accidentally walked into a corridor only for the waiters. Now, a civilized person would say, 'Excuse me sir, the patio is this way.' That's not what I get. I get \"HEY THE PATIO'S OVER THERE WITH A DOOR YOU CAN USE.\" Thanks buddy. Great service.  The only positive about this place is that the patio in the back is nice, with lots of sun - an unfortunate rarity. That would be the only reason to visit....no wait, there really is no reason to try this place out.   This place needs new management and better staff. Maybe the show, Bar Rescue would help. I will never be coming back to this place. Good luck Spirits! You'll need it."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for my food for exactly an hour. Food was never exceptional in this place, but this time it was even worse. If you have a choice, Lola next door is much and much better!"}
{"text":"Was there with a group for karaoke night.  The wings were dry, and I am sure the wing sauce was a cheap watery one out of a bottle.  Dips were watery, causing a mess because no cutlery was provided.  The waiter seemed only interested in selling alcohol.  When asked for a glass of water he seemed annoyed and brought warm tap water, and had to be asked for a little ice.  Dirty plates were not cleared unless the waiter was actually asked to remove them, with the result that our table became a slippery sticky mess covered with dirty plates and chicken bones.  Even if he came to replenish drinks dirty plates were not removed, he would go back empty-handed.  Spills were ignored so our clothes got dirty.  Ugh, the service was so bad!  On the plus side, washrooms were clean.  Karaoke was good though far too loud at times.  The place could be good with better-trained wait staff who understand service.  It is all fixable."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight.  Pulled pork was great. however - I resent the extra 2 bucks for swapping  salad for the ubiquitous  fries.  The salad was a very small side bowl  portion of mixed baby lettuce leaves with a simple vinagrette  2 bucks more than fries? really?  but the food was good  id go back"}
{"text":"Have anyone ever food poisoned here? I went there with another 2 friends, and I got serious stomach upset one hour after eating there, it was one of the worst stomach problems I had in years, and my other friend, called in sick today, cause his stomach pain lasted all night and all morning.   The food honestly tasted normal, but I didn't have anything else all day except for a cookie and a latte around noon, so I think I can blame the teriyaki salmon, anyway, I'm giving it two stars cause the service was alright."}
{"text":"Spirits is a friendly pub just south of Bloor on church street, which is regularly frequented by the office-workers crowd. People from our office in particular visit often, because of the proximity to our building.     I am not a fan of pubs, by any means. Primarily because I don't eat meat and drink beer so rarely. Even so, the quality of food is decent, the servers are attentive, the meals come quickly and the place is nice and clean.  On our last visit, we arrived a group of nine and were fed and paid within the hour, which is excellent for the lunch crowd.   Veggie burger is lacking and horrible, (those soy and veg patties) and there are only a few healthy/veggie options on the menu. But, I expect this from pub food.  Nice patio(s) in the summer serving up cold beer. What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Food was weak especially for the prices. Service was lacking. Was not asked how the meal was at any time. No cutlery was brought. Had to ask for it. Not very busy. Only a few tables. Staff was all sitting inside at the bar watching a movie the entire time and they had the movie's sound piped loud through the bar speakers."}
{"text":"This is Toronto's great spigot for the multiverse.  There's a lot of good in here and nothing particularly bad; in fact I think it has some rather subtle appeal due to it's very undefined nature.  Although it does occupy the sweet spot for the after work crowd M to F just after 5pm - there's quite a bit more.  New management has brought a tighter kitchen and the share plates have moved up from the previously precarious pedestrian perch to exalted \"better than expected\".  That means your group will order the minimum quantity to provide a suitable alcohol buffer and be pleasantly surprised and venture beyond the safer choices.    On a recent Saturday night, my intrepid little group braved the patio - because it had been so nice a few hours before.  We ended up having an awesome with each other, the parade of passers-by and the staff.  Oh yeah.... the staff; The serving staff is worthy of special mention.  They are simply one of the finest I've ever experienced in an unpretentious watering hole.  Attentive, witty, playful, there when you need them - gone when you don't.   Bottom line - stopped in because of the patio and found a great place to hang with friends."}
{"text":"\"Making your way in the world today takes everything you've got. Taking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot. Wouldn't you like to get away? Sometimes you want to go Where everybody knows your name\"  ... Okay, this bar is not Cheers. ... But it's the closest thing to it at Yonge and Bloor.  I've been to Spirits a few times. It's the local pub for local peoples. The bar doesn't seem particularly busy except for special event nights. I had the poutine with added pulled pork, which surprised me! It was actually flavourful, and saucy, much better than expected. The nachos looked pretty damn good.  The Wednesday comedy night is amazing and it's totally worth checking out!  Jo-Anna Downey is such a funny host!  She sets the tone and the crowd is enthusiastic and high energy all night!    The place is packed full of people so you'll want to get there early to find a seat.  Perhaps order $7 appetizers which are also a special on Wednesday!  You'll want to order food if you can before the show starts because during the show service is almost at a standstill (which is sort of expected).  The show starts around 9pm.  There's no cover and you get to see some more seasoned and also newer comedians.  I like how there's fresh talent and you get to watch a variety of acts.  If you sit at the front, you might get teased so be prepared!  Spirits is an alright place to unwind after work. But, it's the comedy nights that keep bringing me back!  Comedy night is 5 stars  * * * * *  !!   But in general, the venue is 3 stars * * *"}
{"text":"I really liked my veggie burger. It came with caramelized onions, sauteed peppers, mushrooms and garlic mayo on a toasted bun. Our pizza was soggy though. Also unforgivable, a margarita should have fresh not dried oregano!"}
{"text":"This a local watering hole and not much else. You won't be wowed by anything unless being out of nachos on a Friday wows you (Which was the case when we went). You'll still come here because it's close knowing there are better options (also the case when we went)"}
{"text":"Decent pint, service can be slow from time to time so I usually just order from the bar and grab a seat on the patio. The food is only ok, standard pub fare with nothing special, so Spirits is not a place I eat often.  There are two patios, one at the front and another at the back, so Spirits is ideal for a cold pint on a warm day. They have open mic comedy night on Wednesdays which looks like fun. There are also after work drink specials from 4-6pm.  Overall three stars, would rate higher if the food was better and the service a little faster."}
{"text":"I love Spirits. There food is pretty good. I was sitting out on the patio one night with some friends and i spilled my drink. The waiter gave me another one for free. That was such a sweet thing to do. Also the karaoke night are fun as well"}
{"text":"Pretty terrible overall.   First time we went we just had the wings and a beer and it was solid and left us satisfied.  Second time our fried pickles were rotten. As were the replacement ones. And I don't mean 'kind of off' I mean straight up rotting and rancid. We had those and a few beers. Service was nothing of note.  Third time we said it was the final chance. We always enjoy a caesar at brunch and when we ordered 2 they told us it was their \"Make your own caesar\" bar special. We thought ok that may be kind of fun and were curious to see all the options we would have available to us. We got up from our chairs, walked all the way over to the bar, and had 2 shots of vodka poured into a cup and handed to us. The \"make your own\" bar consisted of 1 almost empty jug of Clamato, Worcester sauce, hot sauce, a couple of pickles and that's about it. It was strongly lacking creativity or options and quickly became a major pain in the ass to do something a bartender could have done for us in less than a minute.  The food was mediocre, the breakfast buffet looked horrific, and our service again was nothing exceptional. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've been here many times for lunch and after work.  The bar is quite big, so it's usually easy to get a table, except on the patio in the summer. The patio furniture is a bit junky, but overall it's a nice place to drink.  The beer selection is average, and the food is decent, if a little expensive. I usually go for the meat lovers pizza, which is greasy and delicious. They used to have a lunch special on Tuesday where the pizza was only $8, but they've since gotten rid of this deal. Boo! The other food is nothing to write home about.  The service here is usually very good and the ambiance is decent but nothing special."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend for dinner. Had Chicken Parmesian entree that left me unimpressed. Thick batter, no flavour, and the veggies were those you'd find in a frozen veggie bag (brocolli, baby carrots)."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Standard fare. It's a typical pub with televisions and sports playing. The food looked fine. My friends had a burger and one had the cheese balls and both looked ok. This is a decent place to meet for a drink after work and maybe grab food if your hungry."}
{"text":"Food and service are ok. There are much better places to go to for lunch."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place! If you go for anything other than their standard pub food. Although apparently their Nachos are amazing, although I never had them. Not my type of cuisine.   You go for the 2 patios to chill? Great place. Go for their weekly drink specials? Great place. Are they alright priced? I think so most dishes go in the $8-$12. The food? So-so. Their brunches? If you live nearby, and you love the convenience like I do, then again, a great place as their two eggs, with ham and toast and wedges is about $6. If you have to *travel* to get here for the food, maybe look at your own neighbourhood.   Now having said that, what this great chill out spot excels at is their Karaoke nights and Open Mic Comedy Nights on Wednesday. Those are very much worth going. Although don't think you will be able to just jump on stage, waiting period for your 5-7 minutes of fame is about 3 months. Yup, they are that booked ahead. Plus I think they pepper some established comedians here and there  to balance the greens which might make the waiting period longer.   It's a great watering hole if it is in your hood."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times over maybe 2 decades! lol but I was there last night with a friend.. I think it had been maybe 7 yrs since I had been there. They have painted the place, new menu, daily specials and same ol' feel to the place.  Our waitress was lovely and friendly. She highlighted the new menu items for us. So we tried the new slow cooked pulled pork sliders, calimari, 10 wings (Sunday special 59 cents each) and well done french fries.   The pulled pork sliders; I personally would have liked them to be hotter in temperature to contrast the chilled coleslaw served underneath it. The wings were fantastic. The calimari was great while it was fresh and hot, not rubbery, but as it cooled it got rubbery and oily. The french fries were exactly how I like them, so I will definitely ask for well done if and when I go back.   I would go back."}
{"text":"We had the daily deal of curry chicken wrap and a side (I, in a sorry attempt to stay healthy, chose the salad; friend got the fries).   The idea is cool: curry chicken but in a wrap...its like indian style pub fare. I was in the mood for Indian, friend was really in the mood for pub food so this seemed like the perfect dish for us both to try.  However, the actual food wasn't great. Both of us felt there was just...'something missing' although neither of us could put our finger on what.  It wasn't bad...per se...it just...had no flavour. I guess you can't expect indian-ish food to have much spice or flavour at a downtown pub, and I fully understand that but there was no taste really, either.   Other than the fact that the wrap tasted like nothing, it was good...it was quite filled with thick pieces of chicken, and some veggies and the yellow, flavourless curry. The side (my salad, friend's fries) were quite generous. I was definitely expecting a sad, 4 pieces of lettuce kind of side, but it was quite a good size, with nice dressing. The meal was quite filling...and I eat a lot and am always hungry.  And it only cost $9.99   So the idea and portion gets it the 3 stars but the lack of  taste is why it stops there."}
{"text":"I can't believe I always ignored this place. Worked at Bloor&Yonge for 5 years and only discovered it recently. Most of their food is excellent and I love the ambience of the place. Perfect for creatives that need to brainstorm or a casual lunch with coworkers or friends."}
{"text":"Amazing bat. They even give me free chips and sausage. And the Cuba libre is very good."}
{"text":"I don't know about this place.  I feel like the owner has given up or something.  They are decently busy, but the food is mediocre, service is poor and the drink selection isn't great.  It just feels like a local watering hole and a pure cash grab with no passion for their food or business.    Last time I was here was a few months ago with a client and we both ordered burgers.  It took almost 35 minutes for both our orders to arrive.  While I can tolerate slow service for exceptional food, I find 35 minutes is a bit too much for two burgers.  Worse is that the fries tasted frozen as did the patty. Maybe the patty wasn't, but it tasted that way.  Not a fan.  So why I am giving them two stars instead of one? They have a fairly good sized patio for downtown.  Yep, that's it."}
{"text":"Ok food. Decent beer selection. Atmosphere is relaxed casual hardwood cottage feel. Has an awesome back patio."}
{"text":"Closed so sad.  Great place to hang and enjoy a beer or two.  Local pub where they really know your name..."}
{"text":"Place is very close by to me! I always stare at the sign of the restaurant and who's smoking on the patio when I walk by so I finally got some food from here.    Bartender and servers are very personable and friendly, I enjoyed the company of the employees more then my actual food..is that bad thing to say?  I had the poutine and another rice dish that came with beef( wish I remembered the actual name of it) The portions were pretty big so you def get your money's worth in that sense. The basmati rice was good, I didn't eat the beef, I just ordered it so my rice has some sort of gravy because I was really craving some rice that night. The poutine was huge, wish they used beef gravy instead of chicken tho, I hate when places do that. If it was beef, I would've loved the poutine because the fries and cheese were great. I had leftovers for 2 days from my order which I think is pretty good. Bill was no more then $20 and oh I forgot to add that the rice dish comes with a salad and naan AND this place only accept cash, so don't bother with debits or credit cards.   I will most likely be getting food from here again, it's just way too close for me not too."}
{"text":"Pretty nice spot, went here on a Sunday night around 830. Waiter/Bartender was a nice guy, the food was really good. Thai Chicken bowl was delicious. My wife generally doesn't like Blackbean Burgers, but this one was excellent."}
{"text":"If you don't have plans on a Wednesday  night and want to get out for a great night come here! FREE comedy on Wednesday nights! The line ups are always different, and you are sure to find a comic that will soon become one of your favourites!"}
{"text":"It's housed one of the longest standing open mic comedy nights in the city which will fill the room every Wednesday.  So famous (or infamous if you like) has the night become, that top acts like Lewis Black and Robin Williams have graced the stage when they're in town.  So, yeah, it's pretty well received.  But there's more to Spirits than just comedy.  There's actually a bar and restaurant to be had.  An L-shaped bar greets you as you enter the bar with a separate dining entrance around the side.  Front and rear patios are available in the summer months, or winter if you need a cigarette or like eating outside in the freezing cold.  I don't know how you roll, and I don't judge.  The interior is warm and more Canadian pubby than anything else.  A good run of taps, friendly staff, and a decent menu would have this place filled at lunch with the local office workers, or after 5:00pm when the whistle blows and folks need a quick pint after the work day.  Add to this, some quite decent food, outside of the usual pub fare of wings, and chicken fingers (which are also good, by the by).  If it weren't for the Wednesday night comedy, Spirits would still be filled on a Wednesday on the back of the pizza special alone."}
{"text":"This is a fairly sizable place on Church just south of Bloor. For a pub it seems pretty clean and there was a good vibe about the place on the night I visited.   The food was really good. Probably 4 stars. We ordered a plate of nachos which was piled high and had lots of toppings with sour cream and salsa on the side. For dinner I ordered the pulled pork. The sandwich was good and my only complaint was that the pork wasn't pulled enough, it was left in slightly large chunks which made it a little hard to eat. The twist they add with their pulled pork is that they serve the coleslaw on the bun with the pork.   The service was the thing that stopped this place from being a 4-star experience for me. It seemed like they were short staffed but the waitress wasn't in any sort of a rush nor was flustered which makes me think that maybe they weren't short. Every time we wanted a refill of our drinks, or even to pale our meal orders we had to try to flag the waitress down. Only once during the evening did she come to ask if we were doing alright.  Note: They don't take debit but there is an ATM to use at a cost of $2.00."}
{"text":"Cozy neighborhood restaurant. Visited it many times when working on Charles Street. Always found wait staff to be friendly and the food choices to be abundant and tasty."}
{"text":"Pretty big fan of this place!  It's become a go-to for my sister and I when we're in the mood for a beer and some nibblies.  Yet to be disappointed with anything we've tried from the nachos to margherita pizza to mac & cheese (I remember this being especially good, actually) to calamari.  Lots of beers on tap, service has never been phenomenal but good enough and there's a lovely patio out back!"}
{"text":"We had about 65 people meet here for a 20th anniversary reunion (the company we worked for closed its doors for good 20 years ago), and I have to say that the wait staff was stellar!! They consistently got our orders right - food, drinks, and accurate billing - even though there were only 3 of them serving our large and sometimes rambunctious group! We were talking and hugging, and mingling around, and it could not have been easy keeping tabs on us. Some of us have kept in touch over the years, but most of us, many of us have not seen each other in all that time!  This was an awesome gathering, and I'm so pleased so many turned out!  I had a small glass of red wine (about $7), and a veggie wrap with a salad on the side which was about $13.00 and quite delicious! It may sound odd getting a side salad with a veggie wrap, but they were prepared differently than one another - the veggies in the wrap were sautéed, and goat cheese added to the delicious flavouring. I would certainly order this again, and I would go back! It was a great experience all around.  Bravo to the event organizers for choosing this great spot, and getting so many of us to attend."}
{"text":"They no longer have happy hour and food specials. In the past two months they have been flip flopping with their menu and prices. Drinks have gone up significantly. They can't seem to get it together and the huge jump in drink prices is nuts. Skip this place! Not worth the hassle and disappointment. One month ago I was paying under $6 for a pint of Rebel and today I paid close to $9 for the same pint! After I wrote this post, I received several messages from people telling me to check out the Firkin on Bloor. It's new, with a great ambiance and good food and drink specials."}
{"text":"As another Yelper mentioned, Spirits Bar & Grill is home to Jo-Anna Downey's \"Open Mic\" Stand Up Comedy show every Wednesday night at 9 pm.  She just had her 15 year Anniversary Show, and WOW what a show!  It is not really an \"Open Mic\", as comics are booked in advance, but you never know who will be on...  Here is an excerpt from her website:   \"Spirits is known as the home away from home for out-of-town comics who drop in from all over the globe and one never knows who will visit our stage.  There have been many memorable shows over the years:   * Mitch Hedberg came by to hang out and Jo-Anna performed his material for him.  * Harland Williams and his cousin Kevin Hearn (of Barenaked Ladies fame) rocked the mic during the only show that Jo-Anna has ever co-hosted - with Kevin's dad Pat!  * Jo-Anna's 40th birthday show was notoriously crashed by Robin Williams and Lewis Black.  * Patton Oswalt graced the Spirits stage before becoming one of the \"King of Queens\" gang and a Comedy Central hero.  * Jo-Anna stood in fear while a random clown rushed the stage (that everyone in the room thought was a planned stunt) and she's also been upstaged by her own niece.   * Michael Moriarty (from Law and Order) is credited with the most surreal experience in the history of Spirits Open Mic Night.  Mike Wilmot, Sandra Shamas, Sean Cullen, Kenny Robinson, Nikki Payne, Debra DiGiovanni - the list of amazing performers go on and on."}
{"text":"There's a bar area when you walk in and another section with a dining area   It strikes me as a very average place. Nothing wrong with it, nothing special about it.  The food and service were okay.   I went here on a Wednesday and saw their free weekly comedy show. It was the typical bar show set-up: lots of comics doing 5-10 mins sets. Quality probably varies from week to week. They were at about 2/3 capacity. The place isn't really designed for performances so don't expect much.  2.5 stars"}
{"text":"This place has really improved over the years.  I'm a big fan now.    Food is pretty good Nice patios (x3) Nice staff Super clean Some good beers  Brunch is pretty good now too.  Had a pulled pork eggs Benny.  Awesome.  Too small for my 'morning after partying' hungries though."}
{"text":"Nice cold beers time and time again. The front patio is nice and quiet and the bar's an arm lengths from the village. Food can be hit or miss. There's also a back patio, both are equally nice. Across the street from Starbucks and near the corner of Church and Bloor."}
{"text":"We went there to warm up after St Patrick's day parade last year. Good beer, friendly staff, the nachos were very good and the spicy thai beef with rice was spicy and tasty. Didn't like the sweet potato fries. They were out of irish stew, hence the wild food choices :) ..."}
{"text":"You know there's got to be something good about this place if it's stuck around since 1987! It's a quaint little restaurant thats split into two sections, the bar side and dining room. It sort of has a cottagey feel with hardwood floors, wood panelled walls with matching tables and booths.When you come in the waitress greets you and you can pull up at seat wherever you like.  I always try to get the booth by the window with the white leather couches.   The staff here are soo friendly and helpful and the food is well prepared from quality ingredients. From the apps to mains they pump out some awesome food!  Pulled Pork Sliders Shredded pork in BBQ sauce, coleslaw, on brioche buns Good stacking of warm saucy tender meat contrasted against the cold cruchy coleslaw. I wouldn't change a thing.  Beef Sliders Mini patties, Cheddar cheese, Jalapeno aioli, on brioche buns' Love the cute little brioche buns that hold there shape. The patty cooked perfectly, bigger than expected, juicy, flavourful, with a little punch from jalapeno aioli. Delish!  Large Spinach and Arugula Salad + Certified Agnus Beef Crisp baby spinach, arugula, panko crusted goat cheese, dried cranberries, spiced walnuts, toasted sesame seeds, honey dijon vinaigarette This salad definitely packed flavour! I loved cracking in the fried goat with its creamy goodness spilling out. This salad contained all the elements, crunch & spice from the walnuts, sweet and tart with the cranberries, creamy goat cheese, on fresh crisp greens. Plus the addition of a perfectly cooked medium steak with the delicious honey dijon dressing. Yumoooo!   Margherita Pizza Fresh tomato, Basil, Mozzerella cheese, and Tomato sauce Super thin and crispy crust, hot goeey cheese and fresh basil. Good punch of flavour.  Nathan's Hot Dog + Crispy Fried Onions All beef hot dog, sesame seed bun, coleslaw, pickles Thick juicy beefy dog + $1 extra for crispy fried onions = winner  Double Chocolate Tart Chocolate shortbread crust filled with dark chocolate ganache and dusted with cocoa It's from the LaRocca brand individual desserts....not exciting but ok.  The reasonable prices and amazing food here is definitely why it's stuck around soo long. They change there menu seasonally and have daily specials to keep things fresh and upbeat. I'd skip dessert here but you'll definitely fill up on the delicious apps and mains!"}
