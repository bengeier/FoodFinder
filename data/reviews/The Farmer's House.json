{"text":"I don't think I have ever experienced being more unwelcome in any establishment as we were in this one. Our older waitress was extremely unwelcoming, to the point of being flat out rude. Very disappointed as the hostess and atmosphere seemed lovely."}
{"text":"just really good. This is what happens when a talented chef with and exceptional understanding of real service opens a little restaurant. The food is amazing and fresh, the staff is excellent, the restaurant (an old house) is a really nice environment. Eat here and see if you can stop from coming back."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Could be a bit more adventurous with food as well as getting some real espresso. However, lovely house and setting. Calming overall. Very pleasant and welcoming staff."}
{"text":"Visited with a group on hot day for some dinner and got to sit out on their amazing patio. Our server was quick to bring water  and take our drink order. I had the Spritzer, which had Saskatoon Berry Syrup,  soda water, vodka and mint.  The drink was ok, but I could taste it was cheaper vodka, which over powered the rest of the flavours in the mix. For reasons unexplained, we waited for an hour for our food, which were only flatbreads and salads. Our server apologized profusely and made sure we were topped up for drinks, but somehow all the other tables who were seated after us received their food before us. I had the spinach salad. It was fresh and had generous amount of real bacon, but can't say it was worth $12 and the hour wait. The feeling was all the around the same at the table for the flatbreads.  Would maybe go back for a different drink, just to sit on the patio again, but that's it."}
{"text":"Open at 8 AM for breakfast.   Great value (ham/bacon/chorizo/veg, 2 eggs, cheese and tomato breakfast sandwich $5)   Good coffee."}
{"text":"This gets a solid, Meh?!  Based on the prior review I expected amazing flatbread...and since that is really the only thing on the menu besides cheese platters and chutney, you'd THINK they'd be phenomenal.   First, it was quite surprised at how extremely limited the menu was. Flatbreads or cheese platter or melted cheese with chutney.   We ordered the Chicken & Pesto and Sausage & Peppers flatbreads, and waited. And waited. We were told the wait was because 6 flatbreads were in at once. There were THREE tables of people. If flatbreads is all you do and three tables gets your kitchen backed up, that's concerning.   Finally when the flatbreads came out, I was seriously disappointed. While the Sausage & Pepper WAS good, kudos on the pickled onion, the Chicken and Pesto was a huge sad face. I'm fairly certain the problem was WAY too much cheese, which overtook any of the other flavours, if there were any, although an edge piece with less cheese was still lacking flavour...  As a lactose intolerant person I love cheese more than most (it is like a man you can't have that just makes you want him more!!) but this amount of cheese was overkill. And again, if ALL you offer is flatbread, you really should be an ace at them.   I really want to support businesses in my community but I probably won't come back here.   As for a place to bring KIDS? Ahahahahaa. Well, I GUESS if you're the type of person whose kid appreciates a good chutney....in which case...whoa."}
{"text":"A nice sunny day on their front deck.  I had not heard of The Farmer's House, and saw it on Yelp.  I must say that I quite liked it.  The \"Reuben bagel\" special was served open faced.  It was excellent.  The service was first rate, including the knowledge of the menu and ingredients.  The deck was relaxed, and is quite large. The atmosphere is casual, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  It is a place that I will try again.  Stay tuned...."}
{"text":"Amazing flatbread pizza- and they have gluten free crust that is soooooo good.  We had the house white wine and local brown beer from Wild Rose.  Choose the chicken pesto flat bread (gf) and margherita flat bread.  Super friendly service and we sat out patio which was great.  Definitely will be back, nice to find a restaurant in Calgary that isn't pretentious, super neighborhood feel and outstanding quality food made with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Every time I enter the Farmers House I feel like I'm transported back to the farm that my Aunt & Uncle used to live in up in Northern Alberta. The floors are dark hardwood, the chairs squeak and scrap on the wood and the rooms smell of warm comfort food and baking. The dips, jams and condiments are all canned on site using locally sourced ingredients.   We ordered the Warm Artichoke and Three Cheese Dip this visit with the Margherita Flatbread and 2 beers. It was just the right amount.  Our server was spunky and loved telling us stories. It felt like a home away from home atmosphere."}
{"text":"We chose this place to sit this summer during a street festival as it had good curb appeal and it had a nice looking patio. Staff were busy and I wanted to learn more about this place so I took a small tour of the restaurant on my own (super cute, think Grandma's house without all the clutter). Staff inside were hard at work pumping out the remaining food orders and winding down after a long day. The amazing smell of quality bacon hung heavy in the air.... I could have stayed inside the front doors all day. Yes, the menu for now is limited but who does not like a good flatbread?:)  I think there were some salads as well on the board. I would love to come back and try some food. Our drinks were good, the patio appeared to be very family friendly (small dogs we saw were welcomed on the patio and given water!) and it was neat to be there. (I think it is one of the oldest houses still standing in Marda Loop) This business has set themselves up in a really good area and I think there is a market for the freshness and quality they offer. Something tells me we will be seeing lots of seasonal new items from the Farmer's House."}
{"text":"Came here for a business lunch and can't wait to return for an afternoon of sun on the patio!  This adorable century home serves up farm fresh favourites in the cozy, antique interior and in in the open air of their exceptional patio.  Featuring a small, but well thought out menu, The Farmer's House manages to cover everything from a full meal, shared plates with friends, quick business lunches, full business meetings in the private dining room, or even just a glass of wine or cup of coffee. Speaking of, the cappuccinos are delicious.  I ordered the daily deli sandwich special and loved it. A full baguette loaded with cheese surrounded by Italian deli meats and a fair amount of spice. I wish I could remember just what the heck was in it but unfortunately it was high quality Italian things that I can't read or pronounce. Extra foodie points to you if you know all their deli ingredients!  They accommodated my dining partner's dietary restrictions without any problems, offering Gluten Free options and even returning to the table to mention that the pesto contained a small amount of parmesan, when he asked to have his flatbread without mozza.   Families, business folk and friends, this is a great place to meet for a quality, conversational bite."}
{"text":"Just came across this fresh, new restaurant in Marda Loop - it just opened two days ago! It's in the vintage house on the corner where the Vita caf√© used to be. (The sign for The Farmer's House isn't up yet).  Picture a shady, spacious deck on a sweltering day in the city. Add a vodka berry spritzer, and a sweet Hawaiian flatbread pizza with caramelized pineapples & juicy pork... Yep, that's me right now.  Glad this location is being used again and has opened as a cool place to hang out with good eats & drinks!    Plus, I got a tour of the house inside. The dining area is throughout the house, full of character and charm. I can definitely imagine having a cozy dinner in the sunroom once the weather turns chilly."}
{"text":"Had lunch on what has to be one of the best patios in YYC.   We had about 45 minutes before we had to be at an appointment.   Our server was very personable & efficient.  We ordered the ham & pineapple Flatbread,  soup of the day (lentil) & salad.   Portions were generous & prices extremely reasonable.  We left full, happy & on time for our appointment!   I've since referred friends here & look forward to my  extra visit!"}
{"text":"I was super disappointed in my lunch here today. I've been excited to try this place for months now as I used to love Karma (previous coffee shop). The venue should be awesome because it's the cutest little old house! Well unfortunately it didn't pan it that way. We were sat in a super awkward corner that didn't have anything to offer other than a feeling of being cramped. The menu was pretty unoriginal, it was hard for me to find anything to order (personal choice I know). I ended up settling on the daily special sandwich and it was terrible. Presentation was super sloppy and the flavour just didn't sit well; not to mention it seemed to take forever to be served. And to boot, my latte was more of a burnt cappuccino, which sucks cuz I hate foam. Ah well, won't be back there. Too bad"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing portions. Simple and sweet cafe with a huge patio and unique things like sangria and decadent desserts. Went with a friend and my little one after a day at the pool. Snacks, salad, flatbreads, beer and sweets. Perfect. They customized the pasta for a little (butter pasta) and we all ate and enjoyed the large patio. Food came fast, server was pleasant. Overall a great experience. This isnt my first time. or my last. Such a nice addition to MardaLoop."}
{"text":"I wonder how many people drive through Marda Loop, glance at the cute house on the corner of 33rd Ave and 21st St and continue on oblivious to the hidden gem of a restaurant enclosed in the trees. This is exactly what The Farmer's House is, a hidden gem in Calgary's Marda Loop. The house itself was built in 1912 and truly is a piece of history that still stands strong in Calgary's SW. I was lucky enough to hear about this spot through word of mouth online and was quick to add it to my lists of places to try after skimming some reviews and pictures.  The Farmer's House as the name suggests used to be a farmer's house. The building has been refreshed, but they've kept the rustic and old fashioned feel intact and the home still feels cozy inside with tables nestled around an open kitchen. Outback they've actually parked a food truck that belongs to one of the restaurateurs; this now serves as an auxiliary kitchen. What really drew me to The Farmer's House is their beautiful patio; I've been on all kinds of patios but what really makes this patio special is it's immersed within the trees and fencing of the home. This ingenious idea translates to cozy and welcoming patio experience that feels like true country home dining. There's a good mix of sunny and shady spots, so whether you prefer to be right in the sun or lay low there's a spot for you.  You'll be surprised how large it actually is; they could fit larger parties as well if need be as well. They also have some lights and heaters for night time, I bet this place would be great to hang out at on a warm summer evening, definitely adding that to the to do list for a future visit! You don't have to take my word for it though; they're actually set-up on Google so you can \"See inside\" the restaurant through photos on Google Maps, great to see a restaurant take advantage of this technology :).  The food selection definitely fits the homey and country feel. They feature salads, flatbreads, sharing platters, sandwiches and an all day brunch menu. They also have a daily special board that I found quite large. All the prices were very fair. My fianc√©e went with a Spinach Salad w/ Chicken and I had the Daily Deli Sandwich which was a Calabrese Pork Loin Sandwich. I also ordered roasted potatoes and their homemade ketchup on the side. Their drink selection is on the smaller side, but features local choices which I found appropriate for the setting. The portion sizes are a great size, they're not overwhelming but still a big enough size that you can enjoy the meal and feel full. The salad was good with a modest sized piece of chicken, nothing too special but the Mustard Herb Vinaigrette was solid. The sandwich was served on a full baguette, but was a tad too toasted and crunchy. Looking past this the flavours was good though and it tasted wholesome. I was very impressed with the roasted potatoes and ketchup though, absolutely delicious. I'm not a ketchup person what so ever, but I used up all the ketchup on my plate, it's that good! One thing I found a bit deceiving and disappointing is that their sign says \"Kitchen & General Store\", naturally I assumed they sold food items, unfortunately I was let down and this was more aesthetic than anything. I actually asked the server if they sold the ketchup which I would've happily purchased lol :).  Service was so-so overall, it took quite a while to get acknowledged and served when we first got there. Once we did put in our order there was quite a wait before our drinks were brought out and even longer before we were even given water. Definitely a bit disappointed on that end. We did learn that they were short staffed though and there was a large party in the back we couldn't see, so I was more understanding with this added insight. Towards the end our server was much more attentive when things slowed down and she was definitely able to redeem the bad first impression.  I'll definitely give it another go, good overall experience first time around!"}
{"text":"I'm really glad I stepped in last time I was in Marda Loop.  I love the old house ambience and streetside patio. The service was excellent, and they pour a mean Wild Rose pint. The charcuterie board was delicious and excellent value. I will definitely be back. What a gem!"}
{"text":"Beautiful healthy food in an old character home. I haven't been here since it was the kaffa kafe. It is nice to see they kept the rustic atmosphere but added full table service and a local brewery on tap. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Be sure to check this new gem in the heart of Mardaloop out! It has recently opened in an old location. Enjoy the outdoor patio, it's really big. It's an old house that has been converted to a restaurant, so if you sit inside you will enjoy the atmosphere as well.  They make really good pizza, and the prices are quite reasonable. There is not much variety in food and drink selection, but I guess that's part of the whole experience of dining \"at home\"."}
{"text":"This is the most beautiful patio in my Neighborhood of Marda Loop , you feel like you're out of town when you sit there amongst the trees and flowers. My only grievance after just going back this weekend is that if you walk two blocks down the road you can get the same pint of my favourite beer (Velvet fog) for almost 3 bucks less. I hope they stay competitive and join the price point of the other locations !!"}
{"text":"I love this place - good quality food prepared well. The patio is beautiful, the inside is quaint with lots of character, and I've always had great service from friendly, down to earth staff."}
