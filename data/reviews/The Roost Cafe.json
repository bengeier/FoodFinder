{"text":"I've been driving by their sign for weeks and finally went in.  It's an adorable little cafe with great friendly staff and great atmosphere.  The kind of Cafe I love to discover when travelling.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"They make a dynamite coconut milk latte. Also,enjoyed a chocolate energy ball as a healthier alternative. My son loved the lemonade and homestyle brownie. The front of the house is a tiny antique shop and I believe the building used to operate as a general store from some of the newspaper clippings on the wall. Lovely spot outside to enjoy your treats."}
{"text":"King City's hidden gem - really, we just about walked past it. To start, parking - there isn't a great deal of space available (and if you are generally loath to parallel park you might not be pleased) but we got by. The café is situated inside a home (you can sit outside on patio chairs or even promenade in the lush backyard if you please), which initially gave me the heebie-jeebies (is this not what horror films are made of!?) but ended up being the highlight of the experience. If you prefer \"cozy\" over \"commercial\" when it comes to coffee venues, the Roost does not disappoint. The interior provides a homely atmosphere, complete with adorable signage and comfy seating next to a giant window which invites a pleasant outdoor view. My friend and I ordered a plain coffee and a chai masala tea, which came up to $4 and change - quite reasonable. Although we agreed that the tea was too light for our liking (to us it tasted heavily watered down), I thought this place was so quant and nicely decorated that the ambiance alone wins the four stars. There are not too many seats (which is part of the concept, I suppose) but we had no trouble finding some and it never felt packed. There is also a bit of background noise from occasional trains passing by but it is hardly any disturbance. I would like to come back to venture into the selection of desserts and salads which, at least at first blush, looks fantastic."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place! It's the perfect little coffee house. It's so cozy and the food and drinks are delightful. I am addicted to their energy balls and their Chaiwalla tea latte. It's tucked away off of Keele Rd but somehow people are finding it because it's busy every time I'm there! I'm hoping they extend the seating to the front area which is currently a small antique shop. In the summer they have a great deck that looks out at the peaceful yard. I'm so happy to have this little gem in King City!"}
{"text":"Seems like a bit of a hobby business, not that it's a bad thing. They carry Pilot coffee, and have taken the time to send their staff to Te Aro for basic training in coffee. They have a Simonelli Victoria Arduino and most of the staff seem interested in learning to be good baristas. The space is cute and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Food offerings are decent and they have Kawartha Dairy ice cream.  For those who like milk drinks, this is the best option I've found anywhere near Vaughan or King and I expect they will continue to improve with time."}
{"text":"Great small local cafe. Fresh baked goodies  were very delicious. Very nicely decorated."}
{"text":"This can easily be my favourite cafe if I lived in king city.  We stumbled upon the roost cafe as we were in the area and in a seriously need of caffeine.  Situated in what looks like a heritage home, this cafe is super quaint with a serene view of the valley.  The decor is tastefully rustic which is very fitting to the location and view.    I ordered an americano with blueberry almond cookie while the Mr. ordered a turmeric latte.  The cookie is gluten free and freshly made each day.  They also have other baked goods like butter tarts, croissants and even sandwich and soups.   This is a hidden gem if king city!"}
{"text":"This cute little café in King City is a nice alternative to the typical Starbucks/Tim Hortons. The coffee and lattes are decent and the place has a home-y feel with it's country décor and local art.   I like to come here on the weekend during a walk around town since it's the only time I can catch them open. It would be nice of the hours were extended later into the night, but understandable as the location is hard to justify it."}
