{"text":"We have been here twice now. 
First time we ordered wings, they was ok.
Grilled cheese with apples were ok
Cheeseburger was ok but small for the price.
Service was great!!

Second time 
Service was good,wish the waitress would have asked if we wanted anything else or another drink both our bottles were empty. She just handed us our bill.

Food :grilled mac and cheese,it was good,it was nice it wasn't just Kraft Mac and cheese. Nothing was special about it, it had franks. It needs something else. We got sweet potato fries the were good, wish they had sea salt on them.
I ordered the fish fry. I got beer battered, lots of beer flavoring. The breading is good. I didn't care for the paper under it cause every time I cut ,a piece of paper came with it from the grease soaking it up. The fries were ok. The dinner roll was good ,I would like it to be warm though.
We loved the outside patio. 
Wish they had lunch special's,and a drink menu. 
We will be back. 
Love that the owner comes to check on you!!"}
{"text":"We ate lunch here on a slow Saturday afternoon.  The food was outstanding - everything we had was very good.  We started with the jalapeño corn bread with the homemade pepper jelly and can highly recommend it. The gooey bluey got high marks and so did the apple cheddar melt. The real high point of the meal though was the roasted cauliflower soup, the homemade soup of the day. 

If this was based on the food alone it would be a five star review but the area that needs improvement is the service. We saw the friendly owner at our table more often than the tie dye clad waiter who left our drinks empty for almost half the meal and did not check up on us. The owner did stop by a few times though so hopefully the service gets straightened out.

It is nice to have a more upscale pub in town.  We will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"The chef and his professionally educated and experienced chef, have created a true gem in Sun Prairie while located within the new Hockey Rink.  The menu is creative and consistently mouth watering.  They offer the best tasting burgers in Sun Prairie.

The  Gooey Louie  offers a cheddar cheese stuffed burger, an array of aioli, topped with lettuce, tomato and onion on a brioche bun.  At $11.50, you can be assured that you'll get your money's worth.

One alternative, my personal favorite, is the Gooey Bluey.  Adequately stuffed with blue cheese crumbles, one aioli, topped with lettuce, tomato and onion on a pretzel bun, it will exceed expectations.

The atmosphere welcomes you with a beautiful, family crafted bar and back bar.  Handcrafted tables blend into the environment and invite.  Dine inside or in the heated porch.  Sports lovers will appreciate the well-placed televisions. 

If you are a hockey fan, parent or player...You will enjoy the convenience of Sun Prairie's brand new, two sheet, hockey rink that is.....ATTACHED to Willy Ty

The success of Willy Ty has spawned a sister restaurant in Verona, WI.  View menus and specials and menu selection on Facebook and http://www.willietys.com"}
{"text":"Absolutely Horrible food over priced and inattentive staff. 

Butchered the Pourine - fail 

soup fail 

fries over cooked cold and stale

Wait staff would rather gossip then do their job.

Do not recommend at all.

Hope the rink gets something else because the volunteered concession stand is a 10 compared to this so called restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. My favorite part was the sauce you can get with your order. We got our order to go and it traveled very well. No mushy bun or wet fries.  Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"This is my 5th time here and had the daily special several times. Today was a BBQ chicken griddled sandwich and i chose to includ the tomato bisque. Absolutely delicious. The owner was very pleasant and offered advice on food and beer choices."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the food, prices, service and look.  Great family atmosphere with really good stuffed burgers. I recommend the Firehouse Burger with sweet potato fries.  I also had the Dry Rub wings and will say they are hard to beat.  I'm very impressed and will definitely recommend this to my friends!"}
{"text":"Your average pub food. Nothing overly great about this place. Probably won't be back unless I have a coupon."}
{"text":"Pros: The food was very delicious. We had the Pork Belly Burger and Cordon Bleu Grilled Cheese. The menu is a twist on the familiar classics that you love to get at a Pub. The variety of grilled burgers and sandwiches was creative; the descriptions made me want to try all of them. Atmosphere was typical of a sports bar: TVs were on, the games that weren't broadcasting with sound had CC on so you could read what was going on.

Cons: The staff seemed a bit inexperienced. I'm sure this will improve over time, as the location is brand new. As I was reading the menu, I found typos (plural of aioli had an apostrophe) and the biurb on the back of the drink menu about the restaurant could use some editing to clarify and make the story flow better. (picky, I know, but hey, communication matters)

Overall, our family really enjoyed the food and plan to return. Willie and Ty did not waste their culinary school training. Delicious! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Had lunch w/ another hockey parent this afternoon. A bit pricey. They didnt takeoff my 10% coupon but food & service was good.  Grilled cheese & soup enjoyable but really? How do you screw up a grilled cheese sandwich?  Slightly above avg. had a nice beer selection & its connected to Sun Prarie arena arena so its decent."}
{"text":"I really don't like to write bad reviews, stopped in to Willie Ty's previously and thought the food was meh, a yelpers term for okay I guess. Decided to give them another shot today and stopped at the check in station, it was like we were invisible? Waited awhile, nothing. Walked out to the outdoor seating, twilight zone, see ya later good bye!"}
{"text":"What a bummer! 

I have been here once before and I really loved the food. I was excited to take my son to try out their grilled cheese since being 5, it's one of his favorite foods. I hate to say it but I was very disappointed. I asked if I could get him a kids mac & cheese grilled cheese since they have one on the adult menu and the waiter checked with the cook and said that was fine. The waiter was nice enough, and when the food came it all looked really good. But that was the end of anything positive. 

I got the turkey pesto grilled cheese and tomato soup. The soup was awful. I took maybe two bites. And the sandwich was not very good either . I barely ate any of it. The fries were ok and I didn't mind the garlic aoili. My son only took two bites of his grilled cheese, so I tried it and it was very bland. The waiter never came back to see how things were until the very end so there was no option to change things out. Plus I found out that there was a special Mother's Day menu that I was never offered even though I was there with my son. 

I think what bothers me most is that they charged me for a kids grilled cheese and a kids mac & cheese plus his drink. I spent more money on his food then I did my own. Why wouldn't you volunteer that information that you're going to charge me for two kids meals? That just seems ridiculous. 

Unfortunately I don't think I'll be dining here ever again."}
{"text":"Excellent food, wonderful staff and service, and a great outdoor deck for summer dining and enjoyment. Appetizers and dessert portions are large enough to share and the staff was extremely accommodating."}
{"text":"Had a great meal tonight with my husband! Service was excellent as well as the atmosphere and food. I had the pesto avocado griddled cheese with sweet potato fries and a siracha aioli. The griddled cheese was crisp on the outside and melt in your mouth on the inside; the aioli gave the fries just the right amount of kick. My husband had the gooey Louie and thorough enjoyed it. Highly recommend Willie Ty's!"}
{"text":"First time there and now we're wondering what took us so long to stop in.  Clean and appealing decor. Friendly staff who knew the menu well. That's always appreciated. Our food came hot and timely. The Drunken Mushroom burger was delicious. Fries with aioli were great!!  We never had to wait for a refill of soda either. We look forward to our next visit. Support this local gem and dine in!"}
{"text":"Great small pub and grill attached to the Sun Prairie Ice Arena.  Wings are delicious and the beer is very cold. I recommend this place to anyone wanting a beer before a game or after.  Lots of TVs to watch the game and the woodwork is astounding and all made by the owners father."}
{"text":"We tried the Shredded Buffalo Chicken Flatbread, which was quite delicious.  It was enough to feed two, and was a good value.  We even had a few slices leftover.  I believe they have a deal on the flatbread pizzas where you can get 2 or $20, which is a bargain.

We tried a couple beers, and the prices were about what you'd pay in Madison.  Not bad.  Prices did seem a notch high on burgers, but they are stuffed with cheese, and come with fries.  The prices aren't bad, so I'm not sure what some others are complaining about.

We went on a Sunday afternoon, and it was pretty quiet.  Given the small indoor space, I can imagine it could get a little noisy.  The outdoor space looked very nice, though.

The staff was nice, if not a little slow.  My Moscow Mule was perhaps a little weak.  

Overall, I liked this place.  I'll go back."}
{"text":"I went for lunch on a cold day in January. There were only a handful of people in there and just one waitress (weekday). It took a little longer than I expected for our food to appear, but it wasn't unreasonable. I had a chicken flatbread (it looked like a very crispy irregularly-shaped pizza) that was very good. My husband had a steak sandwich and loved it. 

The beer selection was nice. I had a porter that I enjoyed very much. The place is decorated like a sports bar (because it is one) but has some lovely functional woodwork. I'd go again any time."}
{"text":"I had a pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and Mac and cheese in place of fries. All three were very good!!  I especially loved the pulled pork. It was one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I have ever had!!  The cost was $11 + 2 for substituting the fries. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife, 3 year old, and parents on a gorgeous Sunday for lunch.  1 server, 1 bartender, 2 cooks so you can imagine how this was going to go.  35-40 minutes to get our food.  When we did it was good but everyone was overly distracted by how slow the kitchen was (especially my 3 year old).  If we eat here again hopefully it will be faster and I can improve my review."}
{"text":"I had the beef on wack griddled cheese, and I'm pretty sure it was the best grilled cheese sandwich I've ever eaten! I would love to know where they get their bread and how they get it so perfectly crunchy. Simply amazing. And the fries were just as good when paired with horseradish aioli. 

My dad had the clam chowder and moaned with delight every time he put the spoon in his mouth. 

Everyone else raved about their sandwiches as well. 

Nice job, Willie Tye! We were all impressed and very happy."}
{"text":"Good food. Relaxed atmosphere. An enjoyable place to eat dinner."}
{"text":"Had a mid afternoon lunch here, and we're thinking about returning for dinner. Yes, it is that delicious. The food is crafted and curated with amazing flavors. The buffalo chicken sandwich wasn't dry and had intense flavor. My boyfriend gobbled it up without taking a single breath. Dare I say the tomato bisque was the best I've ever had? The Muenster burger was packed with ridiculous flavors (onions and mushrooms sautéed in red wine, and absolutely loaded with cheese) and the beef tasted crazy fresh. 
It helps that this is a family owned joint with a spirit to flourish. Good luck to the future of Willie Ty's. I hope they stay around for years to come."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch on a Sunday. We had the jalapeño cornbread as an app, and it was delicious and lovely. I ordered the soup and salad, which were tiny.  The cauliflower leek navy bean soup had good flavor, but it was pretty thin. My husband had the firehouse burger, and it was a little disappointing too. It wasn't spicy or even all that flavorful. The fried egg overwhelmed the burger, and he thinks they forgot to add the habanero aioli.  The fries were decent, and the sriracha lime aioli was tasty. We may try this place again even though it didn't quite live up to our expectations. And they are soooooo slow. Maybe they should hire some additional waitstaff? The outdoor patio looks like it will be nice when the weather warms up."}
{"text":"Food was very good and we had excellent service.  Poutine, cheese curds, and avocado hummus were all excellent.

Pork sandwich was also very good."}
{"text":"Group lunch. Service was excellent, food was real good - a step away from predictable WI bar food.  Brisket sandwich was solid.  Good craft beer selection.  Need to stop back for brews and bite some time in eve.  Connected to community ice arena and next to SP HS so I am sure crowded at times."}
{"text":"Ok, so there is so much to say about this place.

Service was ok. It took us a long time to get drinks and we ordered a beer and a soda. The bar was understaffed for a Saturday night and we noticed! There was clearly something happening next door at the ice arena and management should have been better prepared. Our server was pleasant but not extremely knowledgeable. She told us the darkest beer they had was Capital Amber when there were patrons around us clearly enjoying a porter or stout. She did however, happily relocate us to a table further into the restaurant. We were seated right next to the door and it was COLD! 

The food is pretty good. My husband and I each enjoyed the fish fry. You get three huge pieces with a wheat roll, cole slaw, and a choice of potato. They easily subbed out sweet potato fries for regular fries which is cool. Some places are strict about their fish fry sides, these guys aim to please. Food came out of the kitchen piping hot, which I love. It wasn't properly expedited so we were missing butter and tarter sauce but our served noticed immediately and brought the sides over. 

The menu was super interesting and diverse, hello, nachos made with bratwurst! The tables are big and there's TVs everywhere which would make this a great place to take in a Badger game. 

This is where it gets strange. We had just gotten our drinks when we noticed a large group of women confront a server and seat themselves. While this would have been fine if they would have actually fit at the table, they began to take chairs from all the tables around them. They were invading other patrons personal space. My husband and I were clearly uncomfortable as they helped themselves to our table without asking. I felt bad for the poor server. They already had drinks and were clearly not ordering food so that poor server was completely screwed out of a tip. While I understand that there is little the establishment could have done, I do feel they have a duty to other patrons dining in their establishment. They could have easily asked the women to wait or offered to break them up. Instead, my husband and I couldn't wait to get out of there. People were leaning on our table, shoving my purse over etc. it was not handled properly and given its location, I feel that this could be a reoccurring problem that will drive away local business. 

I will return to try their other food and hope that they solve some of these problems as I could easily see this being one of our regular go to establishments. It definitely has potential!"}
{"text":"Best fish fry I've had in the Madison area. My wife had fish tacos and wants to come back next week to get them again. Don't be fooled by the ice rink. This is a restaurant to try!"}
{"text":"Been here many times and have had consistently well prepared and delicious food.  I always go for the weekly specials to take advantage of chefs creativity, but regular menu has some solid choices as well.  Try all of the aiolis!"}
{"text":"Yet another Bucky Book stop. What we have learned from this tour is the coupons bring the bill down to about what we would see at some of our more regular and inexpensive restaurants we patronize.

Willie's was good but just seemed expensive for what we ordered. Hubby got a burger with blue cheese while I got the brisket sandwich. Both were $12 with a $1 up charge to substitute soup for fries plus the coupon required beverage purchase.  Both meals were good though the brisket was more like pot roast than a good sliced brisket. 

Definitely a sports versus a family restaurant which we expected given the proximity to the school. Nothing wrong with that just notable if you have small children. 

Will we be back? Maybe if our travels take us this way again but likely won't be seeking it out."}
{"text":"Very noisy. Prices a little too high. Bottled beer 7.50. Ouch. Won't be back. Burgers small for the price."}
{"text":"Amazing staff, attentive and friendly. The food.....best stuffed Burger...apple bacon cheddar grilled cheese....the BEST EVER! We could give more than 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Cornbread muffins are delicious! Fantastic grilled cheeses & super friendly staff and owner."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  The specialty burger was so good. A friend ordered the special griddle  cheese and loved it. We'll be back often!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best places in Sun Prairie for dinner or lunch!  Awesome appetizers and incredible grilled cheeses with very unique combinations of flavors.  You really have to try a little bit of everything when you go here, just amazing food all around!!"}
{"text":"My daughter's chicken fingers tasted exactly like my beef brisket sandwich. Enough said."}
{"text":"I'm writing this with giving this new eatery the benefit of the doubt because they just opened, and I hope are ironing out the kinks.   Our waiter was slow and not very energetic.  Only checked on us once the whole meal.  I ordered the grilled cheese with apples and bacon.   It was good, and their tomato soup even better.  My son ordered their Mac and cheese.  He wasn't happy with it, I tasted it too and had no seasoning and was super bland.  The sweet potato fries where the high light of the meal.  Super yummy!  I will come back, but I hope they can step it up.  Another plus is that it's attached to the ice rink in Sub Prairie.  Good entertainment there!!!"}
{"text":"The \"Gooey Louie\" and wings rock! There are many awesome condiments and Aiolis! I should know, I tried them all! I'm not kidding! Willie Ty's Rules! Eat Meat!"}
{"text":"Food was good, had a grilled cheese sandwich, but a bit pricy. Not sure if I would go back again because of prices but it's a cute clean place to try"}
{"text":"Nice pub fare here. We started with the jalapeño corn bread and it was spicy sweet n good.  My companion had the beef on whack with horseradish aeoli and it was yummy. I had the pork belly cheeseburger with horseradish and the burger was moist and delicious. A sports pub atmosphere with plenty of televisions and both indoor and outdoor sheltered seating. Service was prompt friendly and helpful in choosing our meal. Want to come back and try more of their aeoli sauces and burgers."}
{"text":"The outside seating area is awesome - tons of room. The inside was not what I was expecting. The bar is smaller than I expected, but it has really nice finishes. They have a good beer list and the food is excellent. They have a smaller menu, but the only thing I think they are missing is some sort of unique cheese curd appetizer. My favorite item on the menu is definitely the Firehouse Burger - wow, this is amazing - the perfect amount of heat. Tons of my friends order the grilled cheese with apples on it and love that too."}
{"text":"First, the positives...good food, good service, nice atmosphere. They have parking reserved for them in front, so that's not an issue. The bad: their special mayo sauces taste bad and the mac and cheese is extremely bland. (Not Wisconsin-worthy.)"}
{"text":"This is a decent lunch spot. I tried the chicken cordon bleu sandwich. They toasted the bread, which was a nice touch. It added a nice crunchy texture. The chicken was cooked well and not dry. There wasn't much ham on it, I couldn't really taste it. The cheese was melted and held everything together. The fries were nice and crispy. 

Service was fast and the staff was very friendly. They also have a nice outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place a two-star review is the prices.

The service was great, the food was good, and the atmosphere was nice.  I can't hate on anything they did, but dinner with my family (two adults and a ten year old) came to almost $70 (with tip).  

Entrees range from $10-13, tap beers are $4 or more, and most of the appetizers are around $10.  It adds up fast, and I don't really think the burger and a smattering of fries I ate tonight was worth the $10 and change it cost.  This place is serving glorified bar food.  It's good bar food, but it's still bar food. And bar food should cost bar food prices.  Burgers, $7 tops.  Appetizers, $4-6, tops.

I'd go back here, but only about once or twice a year, max.  If they drop the prices, I'd go a lot more because they certainly have a solid product.  They're just overcharging for it."}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed to say this, but I couldn't find the front door. I drove out there looking for someplace new, and pulled up to about the middle of what appears to be a patio on the front. Took the stairs on the left and there was a sign on the door on the side saying to 'Please use front door'. OK. I could see a door on the front opening to the patio, but it wasn't accessible from where I was. So I walked down the ramp to the other end. I could see that they had the patio blocked off from the stairs there, too. So, no front door access there, either. Walked back up the ramp, looked at the door telling me to use the front door, and left. I don't know. Maybe the side door IS the front door and 'Please use front door' is a funny way of saying 'Entrance'. Maybe there is another door further down the side that is the 'front'. Maybe the patio wasn't supposed to be blocked off. Maybe the back is the front. Maybe I'll try again. Maybe not."}
{"text":"Burger was good. Flat bread (jalapeño Mac and chees) was just that, FLAT! It had absolutely no flavor. Fish tacos were only okay. Fish was very fishy and tortilla shell was hard and chewy. Food was over priced. We were told our order would take longer due to a large party that just came in, restaurant wasn't full. Our food took forever to get. Waitress came to table maybe three times, our drinks were always empty. Will not return."}
