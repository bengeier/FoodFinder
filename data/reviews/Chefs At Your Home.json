{"text":"I hired Jim to do a dinner party for me at home for 10 people and he was beyond amazing!  He gave me some excellent suggestions for what to serve, did all of the grocery shopping, cooked an amazing meal, my guests kept going into the kitchen to watch him cook and to learn some valuable cooking techniques. He prepared Pasta Alla Chitarra with classic Bolongese Ragu, and beautifully roasted local seasonal vegetables, home made Garlic Bread with an Italian Tort cake for dessert.   The price was very reasonable. My kitchen was spotless by the time he left.  I have already referred him to 3 of my friends and am planning another dinner party where I will be using him for in September."}
{"text":"We had such a wonderful evening dining at our friends home last night! Chef James truly outdid himself! Our food was absolutely incredible, and he is so pleasant to have in your home while entertaining friends!! Our hosts travel quite a bit with work, so having a chef come and fix such wonderful cuisine in the privacy of their own home was really ideal!!! My husband and I can't wait to do the same thing...Chef James would be the only guy we would call!!!!"}
{"text":"Spectacular service and food that was beyond expectations. Recently had a work dinner which we would generally hold in a private room at a restaurant. This was so much better. Comfortable and no excess restaurant noise and meat the melted in your mouth. Looking forward to future events."}

{"text":"Chef Jimmy was incredible! He made our night so special and memorable. To start off, he brought all his own super fresh ingredients that he purchased that day at the farmers market. He also brought all his own pots and pans. He was very professional and personable, tailoring the experience to exactly how we wanted. We chose to watch him cook during the dinner so we could be involved in the meal. He answered all our questions and gave us tips on how to improve our own cooking. The food was plentiful and each bite was better than the next. We had chicken pot skewers, spaghetti and meatballs, beets and greens, veggie tacos, mussels and shrimp scampi, and his fabulous 'love' chicken with spaghetti and butternut squash. The menu was tailored to our taste and there was no shortage of it - we had enough leftovers for lunch and dinner the following day. He also made delicious chocolate covered gelato balls for dessert! He put all the dishes in the dishwasher making sure everything was clean before he left. Overall it was an extremely positive experience and I would recommend it to anyone. Looking forward to the next time!"}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, and amazing. I never write reviews but after an incredible birthday dinner for my fianc√© I had to share my feedback. Warm, friendly, extremely talented, and a must have for any private event. Highly recommend. A+."}
