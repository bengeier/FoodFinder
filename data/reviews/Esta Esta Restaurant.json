{"text":"This place is amazing. It's true, it's not \"up to date\" but the ambience is still beautiful. The food is unbelievable. I travel the country and eat fine food all over. This is likely the very best Italian restaurant I've been to. It has character. Very Nice music playing overhead. The staff is very attentive and friendly. 

Try the fettuccini Alfredo. The sauce is completely homemade with imported cheeses. Also try the chicken Romano, it's one of the best I've had. 

Server was Anthony, very attentive and friendly. Manager was Carol, very friendly as well! Made us feel at home."}
{"text":"Gotta love this place! Food is awesome and I hope you have the chance to have Jordan as your server."}
{"text":"This is one of those classic spots that reminds you of the Italian community of the old days when you were a kid. I have a tradition of showing up here on special occasion holidays such as Valentines day or other special event days. If you like Veal, this is your spot. The meat was soft, the sauce was thick and robust... the Italian bread... Just keep it coming please!  Service was quick, on point, and faster than my needs. Price was reasonable for what you get. This location is also well known in the community for the lounge side of the business that is a very comfortable bar with what seems to be at least a 60\" flat screen to watch the game on. Chin Down! (salute to the next 100 years)!"}
{"text":"This was our second time going to Esta Esta. First time in 3 years though. I remember the service and food was excellent, and it still is! I enjoyed the quiet atmosphere, and low lights. Our server was prompt and anticipated our needs as far as refills, without having to ask. The food was superb. The dinner bread was fresh and tasty. I personally ordered the double pork chop dinner with baked potato. The potato could have been bigger but that would be my only complaint. We got our meals quickly and enjoyed everything. I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food for a quiet place.   We started with the fried zucchini which was the best we had ever had.  We tried the eggplant parma and the chicken Marsala which were both excellent.   Will for sure return to this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"So good so good so good this place is so old school and everything is made from scratch I love it! I have been here many of times and never disappointed with the food or service"}
{"text":"Esta Esta is one of those quaint hometown family-owned Italian restaurants whose owners hold the secrets to some of the best Italian dishes.  The atmosphere is in pleasing old fashioned Italian style. Their spaghetti sauce cannot be beat, nor their meatballs, which is what my husband always has. I've found everything I've tried to be delicious: crab cakes, chicken marsala, fish, you name it.  Their Tiramisu is superb, and they have Spumoni :-) Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  Try the lasagna or eggplant parmesan.  Wedding soup and clam chowder is homemade.   You just need to get past the building and decor.  Service is excellent and staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"The best Italian food I ever had. Waitress was excellent very knowledgeable and the atmosphere was excellent with Italian music. The hostess was also excellent, friendly, and knowledgeable. Will come again and bring family"}
{"text":"Esta Esta is our go to Italian restaurant when we're in the Monroeville area.  The food is exquisitely prepared and delicious.  The service is great!  The decor is a bit dated but the restaurant is neat, clean and has a wonderful ambience. Would highly recommend this hidden jewel."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place a few months ago.  My wife ate gnocchi and meatballs with alfredo sauce.  I had the chicken parmesana.  

The service was awesome!  The food was even better!

We also had dessert.  I had a cannoli and carrot cake.  My wife had a cannoli and the Tira Misu.  The dessert was heavenly!

I give it 4 stars because of the service and food.  The place is somewhat pricy, but it is an Italian restaurant.  Also, the restrooms are not so great.

Overall, I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"THE WEIRDEST PLACE I'VE EVER BEEN!

My parents suckered my hubby and I along with my bro and his girl to this strange strange place under the illusion of  \"don't judge a book by its cover.\"This place is more like \"sip the kool-aid and enter a time warp!\" Stepping in the place is like a violent swirl back to the 1970s and the movie Good Fellas. It's strange and dark. I was willing to forgive this if the food was good- which my folks claimed-but it was only so-so. 

It's a strange time warp more than anything else."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Pittsburg for business and went looking for a place for dinner. We came upon Nick Marie's Esta Esta. I had been wanting lasagna for a few days so we decided to give it a try. We went through the lounge entrance and was ready to turn around when I spotted the dining room entrance. We still were a bit apprehensive as there were 2 tables with people seated. My husband wasn't too impressed by the strong cheese smell. The food was really good. We ordered the fried zucchini and French onion soup. I had lasagna and my husband had chicken parmigiana. I was really happy with my choice. Wyatt our server was awesome. He was very attentive and friendly. If we have to come back to Pittsburg we will definitely stop here."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Not the best Italian food I ever ate, but it was pretty good. Some other reviews complain about the smell of the dining room. Now I understand what they mean.  It wasn't horrible, but it was there. The food, in my opinion, is overpriced. Our waiter was very friendly."}
{"text":"The food here is very good, however I am only giving 3 stars because of their ridiculous \"policies\".  I met a friend for dinner yesterday & was promptly seated.....at a tiny table, shoved up against a wall.  My friend arrived a minute later & also was not pleased with the seat.  I would imagine I was seated up against a wall because I was dressed in jeans & jean Jacket.....  My friend asked if we could have a bigger table in a better location & our waiter (who also seated us) replied \"we're not allowed to seat 2 people at the larger tables\".....WTH.....there was only 1 other table occupied when we got there.  I replied that I was planning to get a pizza & there isn't even room on the table for the pizza pan & the waiter informed me \"we're not allowed to serve pizza in the dining room, only the bar.\"  I asked if the bar is non-smoking (which I thought was Allegheny County's \"policy\") & he replied it is NOT.  WTH.....you don't allow 2 people to be seated at larger tables & you don't allow pizza to be served in the dining room but you allow smoking?????  I have never been to this restaurant when there was more than 3 tables occupied.....what's the problem here folks?  Not like patrons were lined up out the door waiting to be seated.  Maybe if you'd lower your standards & change your \"policies\" you might fill up a few more of those tables."}
{"text":"I really couldn't get past the smell in this place...everything was old and need updated ...my boyfriend and I  sat down ,looked around, and walked out...so therefore I couldn't rate the food...we went across the street to eat!"}
{"text":"This is an average Italian restaurant at best. The service was slow even though the place was empty.  

I started with steamed little neck clams. This dish is hard to find so I had to try them. They were very good except a third of the clams failed to open. 

The Italian wedding soup was above average.  The meatballs had a great flavor. I wish they gave more than two in the bowl. 

I ordered the veal parmigiana but the waiter brought me chicken parmigiana.  He said that I must have made the mistake but I never order chicken and veal parmigiana is my go to meal. Since it took so long to get my meal I stayed with the dish.  A previous review said the sauce was salty but I believe it was the coating on the chicken cutlet not the sauce. It was very salty.  The side of pasta was good and not salty.  

My final comment is on the bread provided on the table.  It reminds me of Wonderbread. Why is it so hard to find good bread outside of the New York area?

All in all I may go back but with much lower expectations."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for.  I bought a Living Social for $20 to get $40 worth of food.  When we came in the place was empty...a bad sign....but we gave it a go anyway.  The waiter was friendly.  The breaded zucchini was good...and it went down hill after that....wedding soup with only two little meatballs......veal romano that was drenched in some kind of sweet lemon sauce that made it soggy and inedible.  My husband had gnocci that were edible but not good.  Overpriced, and by the way another couple came in and walked out while we were there.....will never go there again.  A lousy experience."}
{"text":"I have only been to this place twice and I have to say the food is wonderful. Appetizers, entrees, desserts, and drinks were really quality. My only real complaint is the wait for serivce. It took a while to get someone to wait on us but that being said once we did get waited on our service was good. I'm not sure what is brining the reviews down for this place because the food is well worth it for the price. I personally think the ambience in the restaurant is pretty nice too. Seems like a great place for a date night."}
{"text":"Well this place is a hidden gem.  This is a throwback restaurant where the owner is actually cooking the meals and comes to your table and makes a special homemade bearnaise sauce. Wow I think the food is great, service great ... Music is the old Frank Sinatra music really awesome.  Tammy the bartender will make you any drink and Mike is the owner so if you're looking for a restaurant where you're not just a number this is the place !!!! I give it five stars because there's no restaurants like it around anymore !!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't even eat there it smells like Vomit the second you step inside the dining area! They need a complete make over!"}
{"text":"If you don't think this is a 5-Star place, you are an idiot, a teeny bopper, or just don't know what good food is. I ate there for the 1st time last night & it was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you walk into a restaurant and feel as though you've been transported to another time and place.  Sometimes its tragic, sometimes its magic.  Sometimes the food is good, sometimes you want to go into the kitchen and stab the cook in the neck.  We've driven past Esta Esta quite a few times since moving to Pittsburgh last year and we've been filled with curisity. It looks like something straight out of Goodfellas. Last night, we decide to scratch that itch and see what this place is all about.

Esta Esta has been open since 1955 and it looks like nothing has changed.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in the door was the overwhelming smell of romano cheese.  Its a confusing smell - it smells a little like puke, it smells a little like rotten food, but in any event, I found it to be somewhat off-putting.  The decor is tacky.  The fake painted windows, the strings of lights with bunches of plastic grapes, the empty chianti bottles on the tables covered with red candle wax and tall red candles all give the place an air of sad nostalgia.  Its dark in the diningroom and that always makes me think it might be really filthy but nobody can see it.  So, right off the bat, I was concerned.  These are not good signs and I almost demanded to my husband that we turn around and leave.  But something made us stay.

There were two tables of people in a dining room of about 20 tables, but it still took the lone waitress about 10 minutes to come seat us.  She led us to a booth and when I sat down on the cushioned bench, I sunk and I could feel a big metal spring poking me in the hip.  She apologized and said \"I should have warned you about that\".  No, they should replace that seat.  But whatever.

A couple more groups came in while we were looking at the menu, one was a party of 8 and one was a party of 6.  And this poor waitress was completely overwhelmed.  She couldn't keep up and every time she came to the table, she apologized.  The bartender came over and helped her, which was nice.  

We looked at the traditional Italian menu and decided not to get too fancy.  I ordered linguini and meatballs and my husband ordered eggplant parmesean.  Our salads were fine, our bread was fine, but based on the decor and service, I was bracing myself for the worst when our food arrived.  We were pleasantly surprised.  The meatballs were bumpy and irregularly shaped, flat on one side, the telltale sign that they were homemade.  Aside from being just a touch salty, they tasted good.  The pasta was cooked well and tossed in sauce and cheese and the marinara was rich and flavorfull.  My husband's eggplant was tasty too.  It came rolled up in little bundles and the eggplant was sweet, fresh and cooked perfectly.  

So despite the scary look and smell of this place, the food was not completely unfortunate.  We probably won't be back, just because there are so many other places in Pittsburgh that serve good food and don't smell like cheese puke.  But I didn't feel like I wanted to go into the kitchen and stab the cook in the neck."}
{"text":"The food is average. The bread served right out of the fridge, nothing special.  It was like dining at my grandma house. Musty smell and the decor is so seventies."}
{"text":"I Forgot about this old fashion restaurant, the ambience was old school the food was delicious, it was a little overpriced they could a gave you a little bit more but I would definitely recommend this place over any corporate store, for A taste of real Italian food, unlike these corporate stores this food is all homemade even their bread."}
{"text":"I have not been to this place in 30 years, and went over the weekend.  BIG MISTAKE. They have not updated ... or probably cleaned since then.  The smell, as others have said is bad. Parmesan cheese, that smelled like puke, mixed with stale smoke.
The bartender was uninterested in our presence. I have never felt like I was so uncomfortable in a bar or restaurant, and that they would prefer that I wasn't there.

The \"regular\" crowd, of about 8 people were at the bar, and the rest of the place was empty, including the dining room.  The regulars swore like truck drivers and sailors at a cussing competition. I couldn't believe that the staff didn't ask them to \"cool it\", or at least use their \"inside voices\" if they must use the \"F-Word\" six times in one sentence. 
Unbelievable.

Ordered from the short menu, because the full menu is so overpriced, and from the look of the place, and the smell, I just felt that it didn't warrant the pricing. If I am going to pay premium prices, I want to be at a \"nice\" place, and this was not IT.  

The staff stared at us and whispered to each other...freakin' weird and uncomfortable. We are an over-50 couple, normal, and upper middle class.  I felt like I was in their chair, or something. LOL.  Getting a refill on a beverage was not an option here.

The food was just OK, somewhat dried.  Their own description talks about \"Michael\" the chef, but, honey, there is a woman or 2 cooking, between their cigarettes and gossip on their barstools. Michael should know how his business is being represented.  I know that 30 years ago, this place was upscale and highly respected. I can't say the same now.
Sad to see them allow their patrons to go down the street, but it seemed that this staff just didn't care about the fact that someone was here to try it out, without a coupon."}
{"text":"I'd like to start off this review by saying that a one star is high balling it. Unfortunately, I can't give a 0 Stars

 I stepped inside with my girlfriend and two of our male friends who were on a date with each other. Immediately, the smell hit us. Vomit mixed with must. I lost my appetite as soon as I sat down. The waiter took our drink orders, and began making small talk, which was pleasant but short lived. When he realized that our male friends were on a date with each other, his demeanor changed. I noticed a few other staff members coming from the kitchen with the one who waited on us, and laughing at our table. I was furious. It got to the point where the man I assume to be the OWNER joined them. We didn't order, payed for our drinks and left. 

A few weeks later, driving past the restaurant I noticed a protest happening in the parking lot. It was an anti-gay marriage protest on Esta Esta's property, and when I stopped to ask about who authorized this, they replied \"the owner!\". I couldn't believe it."}
{"text":"Quaint restaurant with great food.  Try the Shrimp Barsac, it's to die for.  Mike is an amazing chef, natural talent combined with years of training and practice.  The pasta sauces is the best anywhere.  Love this place.  Also great seafood platter and great Monday night cheap spaghetti special."}
{"text":"That place was horrible. Wedding soup was so cold - grease was sticking to my teeth. I couldn't even eat it. 
Interior needs some work... I mean some serious fixing - as I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was in some 3rd world country.
Never again!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food. Try the stuffed eggplant. I Never had a bad meal at Esta. Diningroom setting is frozen in time.You can imagine Frank Sinatra singing.
You will either love or hate the decor but if outstanding Italian food is what you're looking for: this is the place. You must give
it a try and savor the flavors."}
{"text":"SPOOKY, BIZARRE, RESTAURANT 

I should have walked right out when faced with two doors into the restaurant.   As soon as I opened that door, I was immediately greeted by the host who led my co-worker and I down a narrow hallway to the dining area.  I felt like I was following the white rabbit down the rabbit hole.  He sat us down and lit the candle on the table (seriously - we were a couple of guys grabbing an after work meal).  Dimly lit, smelly, musty restaurant.  The only reason I stayed was to satisfy my sense of adventure.  I told my co-worker \"This place will either be the best meal we've every had, or the worst\".  unfortunately, it was the worst.  The host said it was old school Italian, but it was mediocre, overpriced food, in a surreal environment."}
{"text":"Came here not knowing anything about the place. We ate at 6 p.m. on a Saturday evening, and there was only one other party of four in the restaurant. Odd, for a Saturday evening.

Anyhow, upon entry, we realized we picked a \"fancier\" establishment. Very dark (aka poorly lit). Upon being seated, a candle was lit at our table and we were promptly visited by our waitress. The service was great. In fact, I'm pretty sure our waitress visited our table about 6 or 7 times (a little overkill).

I had the Chicken Romano dish, with a side salad and vegetables. The food was decent. Dessert was better. We had a piece of cheesecake that was very delicious.

Overall, I didn't feel like I got much bang for my buck... Prices are a little high for what you get."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Have eaten there wings, pizza, spaghetti, rigatoni, Italian hoagie and fries can say that it was pretty awesome food. The only complaint I would have is that the drinks are a bit pricy.."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly staff, and a decor like your grandma's house.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"**ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!**

We went here on a weekend around 7ish for dinner; we always pass it and were curious but never stopped until one fateful evening...

The first thing you notice is the musty smell when you walk in.
Then you realize that the 70's decor (including hung stripper lights around the ceiling) hasn't changed (probably) since the restaurants inaugural opening.

We were seated and a candle was lit (think Lady & the Tramp-style Chianti bottle with a candle stick... that's what it was!)

Next we were brought our drinks and some stale Italian bread, that I swear had a hint of Freezer-Burned flavor to it.

The menu items had NO descriptions next to anything.
Just the name of the item and a price.  This kind of leads me to believe that the owner must be extremely ethnocentric (bordering on racist) and hate anyone who ISN'T Italian.... what else should I think?
Who assumes that everyone knows every Italian dish?

Playing it safe, I ordered the Dill-Butter Salmon--because I LOVE salmon--and the cauliflower as my side dish.
It came out looking really good!!

When I tasted it, the Salmon was incredibly salty!
I salt the crap out of most everything, but this was even salty for me!
As I ate,  noticed one bite was particularly fishy and, for a second, I thought it was colder than the rest.
Upon cutting into the very center of this tiny piece of salmon, I noticed that it was completely raw inside and freezing cold.

In the entire 6 years that I've been with my husband, I have never complained to a waitress, sent anything back OR made a fuss over the food ANYWHERE.
I just couldn't eat this though.

I was very apologetic to our nice waitress (WHY THE HECK WAS I APOLOGIZING?  ...but I digress) and said that it could use \"some extra time to cook because the center was raw and still very very cold.
Would that be possible?\"
She (the waitress) was then very apologetic and said \"no problem, we'll fix that right up, blah blah blah\"
I'm not sure who was more embarrassed, her or me!

It came back out and I cut into the middle-ish again and it was still just as pink and cold as the first time I sent it back.
I explained to her that I couldn't eat it (still incredibly polite about the entire situation--as I find it embarrassing to complain about food) and that I was through and no longer hungry, because I didn't want to prolong this awkward food fail.

She brought out our bill....

This salmon dish that they botched was originally $19.99 (for effing SALMON... a TINY piece of it, that wasn't sushi-grade and was served raw and COLD without the menu indicating such).

She took $10 off of our bill... so we paid 9.99 for a monkey-dish of cauliflower.
Yep.  True story.
I.  was.  pissed!
When a restaurant does wrong, you take the ITEM off of the menu.
Not a fraction of it and add free cake.
I wanted dinner, not dessert.

Oh, and a piece of cake was put into a container to take home \"on the house\".
I don't want your cake--I'm ready to puke from accidentally eating fishy/cold/crappy salmon... Cake is not the answer to topping off this \"meal\"!

We'll never go back again.

Scent = moldy/damp/sort of dirty
Decor = c'mon, renovate or at least dust!
Price = waaaaaaaaay overpriced for basic Italian fare.
Food = a joke, even my husband's dinner (the Tour of Italy) was mediocre, at best!
(The Alfredo sauce tasted like it came straight out of a jar)

Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh are easy to do, but its even easier to do the FOOD badly.

This place has got to be a \"front\" for something else, I have no idea how this joint stays open!  Maybe they have poker machines somewhere?

Who ever this \"Michael\" cat is, that is said to come and talk to everyone, certainly never came to talk to us!

PS:  Playing old music to make you feel like you're an extra in Good Fellas does not an Authentic Italian Restaurant make."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what most people were discussing in terms of smell.  We rented out the dining hall for a meeting, it smelled a little stale, like cigarettes, but the lounge wasn't too far away and people were definitely smoking.  It wasn't bad though. I usually get migraines and it didn't bother me.

No Ramona cheese smell?  I don't know if it's because we rented the venue late, from 10p to 1am and they weren't cooking.  The pizza was REALLY good. I found the sauce to be delicious.  The staff was courteous and very respectful.  Personally, I thought the decor in the dining hall was quaint. I liked it.

I'm planning on going back."}
{"text":"Went there once and that was it!! First of all it smelled like sewage coming from the bathroom. Decor was old and place looked dirty. Husband ordered a Porterhouse steak which was so fatty and baked potato was hard. I ordered lasagna and it was swimming in a salty sauce and cheese. Worst lasagna ever!! Food overpriced!! I gave it a try and I would never, ever go back!!!"}
{"text":"Visited with my cousin who has been coming here for over twenty years.  The service is warm and friendly.  

I started with the fried zucchini that was the best I've ever had (including NYC, Los Angeles, Italy, London, Hong Kong and DC)!!  Perfection!

I had \"chicken romano\" which is Mike the proprietor's version of 'a la Milanese' and it to was out of this world!  the batter was light, crisp and delicious.  The chicken was moist and very tasty!!  Mike came out to greet us.  Nice guy.

My son had a pizza that I tried and it was excellent as well.  The bread at our table was warm and plentiful.

He finished off with a dense chocolate cake that was first rate.  

The sign on the restaurant says it was established in 1955.  \"If you can't crack an egg,,, don't serve brunch!\"  Nick Maries Esta Esta really delivers an authentic Italian experience for over 50 years (right down to the decor with the candles in chianti bottles on the tables).

I read other diner's reviews of the restaurant.  I had a different experience.  My food was superb and I give it my highest recommendation.  You really should try it and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Definitely a little kitschy in the decor - expected the Brat Pack to walk in - but the food was amazing. We had the fried zucchini appetizer - so light and the sauce was yummy. Between the three of us we had the fettuccine Alfredo, eggplant Parmesan and the spinach and artichoke ravioli. ALL were amazing! Great service."}
{"text":"They're crab dip appetizer is to die for, and their fettuccine Alfredo is amazing! We love coming here"}
{"text":"So this is really good food and our service was prompt and professional. 

Now, don't come here if you are expecting molecular gastronomy, a new take on mac and cheese, an extensive beer list, or new decor.  This place doesn't have that but it does have perfect, old school, italian cuisine.

The decor is old and looks like it is from when the place first opened.  I think it is part of the charm.  Either way, even if you don't dig the decor the place is clean.

We will be back.  Everything was quality and places like this we should cherish.  (I very much cherish the new and unique cuisine that Pittsburgh offers, but there is a place for both to thrive).

I'd recommend giving it a try at Esta Esta.  I enjoyed my stuffed peppers over penne, and the meatballs our other guests got were hits.  Balsamic dressing was great for my salad.  

Thumbs up Esta Esta, we will be back."}
{"text":"So normally I don't visit places that have bad reviews but this is like the only spot in monroeville that we have yet to visit and dine at. 

Me and the hubby choose this spot at 8:45 after quiznos had closed as well as carhops, quitters!! I guess i'll start with the atmosphere then food then service.

We walked in the bar entrance of the restaurant which allows smoking so that was a bit off putting, I wasn't sure where to go so one of the customers directed us to the door just past the beer coolers. The air was a lot fresher in the actual dining area but still rather stale. They do have their own entrance located on the far left side of the building almost as if its in the rear. The place was completely empty with only the hostess and 1 waitress to help us. We pretty much had the joint to ourselves.

The bathrooms are unbelievably small with a shower curtain for a door over the two stalls. not much for privacy but a door would just not fit an cause the bathroom to be even more crowded than it already is. 

The decorations are definitely old Italy style maybe early 80's at the most but that doesn't bother me. I really enjoyed the mirror as a back wall so you could see behind you in the restaurant. 

The waitress and hostess both waited on us mostly because they were bored which they did tell us but they were friendly and we enjoyed talking with them. They gave us the menus which had a lot of options but did seem little over priced. My husband ordered the lasagna and I ordered off their bar menu and got an italian hoagie. I choose balsamic as my dressing because the italian was literally all oil and no flavor.

MY sandwich was great, soft warm bread, tasty meats and a nice layer of veggies. It also came with pickle which I devoured. My husbands lasagna was great too. The meat was so soft and tasty and the sauce made my mouth water. I actually added some to my hoagie. As an appetizer we ordered the stuffed banana peppers which I was told would be spicy but I had no idea they were that spicy. I couldn't eat them and so my husband finished them off. We received three or four large peppers and I just ate the skin with the sauce. Again it was a great sauce!!

Our servers we very pleasant, timely seeing that we were the only ones there. Although our food did take some time to come out, it was not cold and plus everything is homemade here which is always a plus.

So my review is 4 stars for this place. If the bathroom was larger and the bar was nonsmoking I'd probably consider upping the review but four stars is still pretty good!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews mentioning an odor but I went anyway.  Upon entering you immediately smell an old stale motel room type of odor.  Smoke was coming from the bar.  I lost my appetite instantly.    I can't understand why the place was packed."}
{"text":"The meatballs were amazing, the veal tender, thecheesecake creamy. All around excellent food."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to bars. Liquor is a little pricey, but they are very generous with their amounts. The food here is what really makes this place, I love the pizzas and pastas. They are always fresh and delicious. I recommend getting a white pizza and covering it with hot red peppers and Parmesan cheese. The best night to come is Mondays when you can have all you can eat Linguine for $6! And those famous Esta Esta meatballs are only $1 each!"}
{"text":"how did this place go under my radar for so long?   Greens and beans... veal parm and linguini with meat balls.   the gravy was great.......    can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"It is a g-d travesty that this place only has 3.5 stars. I mean look, I get it... doesn't seem much from the outside, and the interior is straight out of the 70's. I've driven past this place for years without giving it a second look. We finally made it in last night on a whim, and Esta Esta delivered where it counts: with some of the best straight up red sauce Italian in the city. 

Zucchini strips were the standout appetizer. Thinly sliced, light batter, delicious red sauce for dipping. The little neck clams were also delicious. 

I had the tour of Italy for dinner. Manicotti, chicken parm, and fettuccine alfredo. Each component was perfect. Well seasoned, juicy chicken. Creamy but not overwhelming fettuccine. And that red sauce again on the chicken and manicotti. You can tell it's cooked for hours. Damn good sauce. 

My GF had the meatballs and gnocchi. House made gnocchi were dense but not too heavy. The meatballs were soft and juicy and again, perfectly seasoned. GF is very picky about her balls, and said these were nearly as good as her own. High praise!

Dad's veal marsala was incredibly tender. 

Dessert options were presented on a huge tray. We managed to make press on with NY cheesecake and Italian cream cake. Cream cake was moist and dense, but Dad didn't care for the coconut. Whatever, that's his problem. Cheesecake was creamy and delicious. 

In a wasteland of strip malls, chain restaurants, and fast food, Esta Esta is an oasis of simplicity and great Italian American comfort food."}
{"text":"I have lived near Monroeville most of my life and drove past Esta Esta a thousand times but never went inside this place. 
After finally changing that last night for dinner on a whim, I'm regretting that. 
Sure, the dining room is outdated as other reviews mention and looks like it did when they opened in the 50's. 

The food is the reason we'll be going back. 
We had the bruschetta, wedding soup, veal parm and 'tour of Italy'. it was all amazing!
The soup was loaded with ingredients.
It's rare when I get served alfredo sauce that isn't congealed or tastes like it was made hours or days ago. 
Loved the crispness of the veal parm and they don't skimp on the cheese. 
Prices were a bit steep but I'm willing to pay for quality ingredients and well executed dishes."}
{"text":"Take a trip to the  early 70's and enjoy your favorite italian specialty. Service was very good, as was the food. We had chicken parm and veal parm. The music was so nice and relaxing.  I would have given 5 stars but the place hasn't been updated since the 70's."}
