{"text":"Andrea is so so easy to work with, and the food is amazing! She catered my wedding (at the most affordable price) and all of my guests were very impressed, as were we."}
{"text":"Two things: the southwestern pork and the barbacoa beef burritos. I lovvvvvvve Mexican food. It's my favorite food on the planet. When I'm  traveling abroad or even away from the border states I constantly crave and miss Mexican. In particular, the southwestern pork and barbacoa beef burritos from Andrea and Lexi. One is definitely enough for a full meal and they're only $6!! The ladies are pretty hot and their food is even hotter. I highly suggest stopping by if you're at the Gilbert Farmer's Market"}
{"text":"Wow! Found Andrea at the farmers market today, and she did not disappoint! The best breakfast burrito EVER!! I will definitely be contacting her for catering my sons birthday party.. yum!"}
{"text":"La Chica Loca just catered our Halloween costume party last night... from start to finish, they were amazing!  Timely, friendly, and helpful from the first message a month ago, to the final payment last night!  We would have them at another event in a heart beat.  Furthermore, every single one of our guests raved about the food!  From the five year old to the sixty-five year old, everyone was in taco heaven.  Thanks, La Chica Loca!!"}
{"text":"Nice find at the farmers market today! They had a huge crowd and still delivered a dang good burrito. We had the pork breakfast burrito (they had pork or beef). The pork was nice and tender with a hint of smoke, which went well with the potatoes, eggs and peppers. I do wish they would've put more of the green chili sauce on the burrito because it was really tasty. We'll be back!"}
