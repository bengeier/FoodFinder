{"text":"Went here for the scallop sashimi. Most foods were really good, one of the best ayce I ever had."}
{"text":"I've been to this place on numerous occasions, and felt it's time I left a review.  It's an AYCE sushi restaurant that is quite pricey. BUT it is the best place I've been to and here's why:  Set up: very spacious location with a nice layout. It's always busy but it's never an issue to get a spot on most days. Very nice setup to bring your date or loved ones.   Service: very fast.  Regardless of how busy it gets, they anyways seem to get your orders done quickly and accurately!   Quality: best in Toronto for AYCE. Listen, their sashimi is fresh as always, the sushi is always on point, the cooked items are flavored to perfection, and the salads are better than most. You can't beat this kind of quality.   All together: it's a hefty 33 bucks after tax on the weekends for dinner. However, you go here for quality and I highly recommend you try it for any special occasion."}
{"text":"The worse AYCE sushi place I've been to in my entire life. The sushi/rolls actually taste gross. There is no standard of quality in this place.   Service is mediocore.  The rolls are not uniform, sloppy, and somehow the combination of things they put into the rolls are disgusting. There are tons of cucumbers in all the rolls and a sliver of fish. Not to mention the cucumbers are mushy and gone bad. Even the ice cream tasted gross.   I just hope we don't get sick! I'm just so surprised there are so many positive reviews!!"}
{"text":"What a horrible experience!!!!!!  While we were eating midway a cockroach appears on a divider, about 10 inches   away from my friend's face.  Unfortunately I dined with human but not frogs so we did not ordered it as part of the meal.  She screamed and jumped, we immediately evacuate the area while the wait staffs did not seem to care what has happened.  The poor little six legged critter must have scared shitless and lose it foot, fell onto a spanking new Mackage jacket that was bought couple weeks ago.  Ouch!!!!   We were standing around, no one came to ask about our well being so I went on a search mission to find that thing, it was clinging onto the jacket tight that I need to shake it off, there it goes underneath the seat and live and breed in the restaurant happily thereafter.  The waitress saw it but did not say a word, I waited for a minute and finally I have to ask for the manager.  He came by, did not show any sign of remorse of giving us such an experience, and offered us another table which is right in front of the one that the cockroach was hiding.  Needless to say we declined it and waned out.  The manager offered us a 10% discount which is a joke and I kindly commented on how we are still midway on our lunch.  Then the waitress came back and offered us 20%, which is still a joke but we are not here to haggle for a free meal so we paid and get out.  After we left, at the door there is a sign shows that this restaurant has a conditional pass on the last health inspection.  For a restaurant that serves uncooked food I found my experience completely unacceptable.  It's just bad that we have to learnt it the hard way."}
{"text":"Best sushi all you can eat in Toronto.  A lil pricey but all their food are made to order freshly.  Lunch and dinner menu are great variety.   Its my twice a week to go to whether luch or dinner while in the office.  Great staffs and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love the beef short ribs and variety of fresh, delicious hand crafted sushi that they offer here. This is hands down my favourite sushi place in Toronto. The prices are reasonable and the food is flavourful. Service is also fast  and they rarely forget our orders (which has happened many a times at different AYCE restaurants). Come here -- you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The sushi here is absolutely amazing when my friends and I say let's go to sushi we just know where to go. The service here sucks big time UNLESS you get the lady manager or the guy manager they are both very polite and very caring about the customer service but the actual servers don't care at all. It is true, you may ask for 5 items and they bring back 3 and you wait for the rest but realistically you just have to re-order them.   The desserts are good my favourite is the tiramisu which is in a shot glass. The place is majority of the time clean and the furnishing  is fantastic and comfortable. I've been to this place many times even though it's expensive because I know the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Always busy. I was there at 6pm but still have to wait for 20mi. Very good selections of food. Fresh, raw, grill etc"}
{"text":"My sister boyfriend could have choked to death literally! We found not only 1 but 2 bones on 2 separate times eating a salmon sashimi! how do you have bones in a salmon sashimi?? If that incident happened to a child, he/she will be choking. We told the server she kindly apologize and someone else came and apologized. That was nice that they acknowledged but the least they could do is give us a discount on the bill but no they just weren't that smart doing business. Never coming again and spreading the word. On second note, waitress there does not understand English. How you live here and not speak a word English??!"}
{"text":"Sushi legend isn't so legend...  Don't know why there's such good reviews when there are better sushi places for people who know better.   It was a full house but the servers were not attentive. The only time they came around was when they grabbed the empty plates from our table. They didn't ask us if we wanted some more tea or soda or even how we were doing. The rice for the sushi was mushy, and the white tuna sashimi was not so white. So I was afraid to eat it. My friend also had vanilla ice cream with 4 hard white pieces (ceramic pieces?) on her first spoonful. Probably b/c they were pre-scooped and left in the freezer for convenience. We told the manager and all he did was take it and brought her a new one without a simple apology.   We were not pleased at the end based on quality and service."}
{"text":"Great AYCE sushi. Quick service. Amazing variety of items on the menu. The sashimi and specialty rolls were all fresh and delicious. I love that their rolls come in 4s instead of 6-8s because you get to sample more and save room for other things. The rock shrimp was delicious and I love that they have fountain pop. The desserts come in little shot glasses which some people love because you can try a lot of things. On a Sunday night, AYCE + tax + tip came up to $33, so a bit on the pricier side, but definitely worth every penny in my opinion. Will definitely return, super impressed!"}
{"text":"Checked out their weekday lunch with my teenage son. The restaurant was packed and with good reason. A bargain AYCE sushi experience with a wide range of hot food and sushi. The only thing we ate and did not enjoy was the pad thai...guess it is better to actually stick to the Japanese options! Food comes out randomly which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. ..like when we got the banana fritters (dessert) before the spicy crab."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 6 for Mother's Day. Good thing we made a reservation - this place gets super busy.   Highlights of the meal: Sexy summer roll - Very light and refreshing with a bit of a kick.  Rock shrimp - Jumbo shrimp without the oiliness of tempura.  Desserts come in shot glasses so we ordered about 20... :)  The sushi is pretty fresh by Toronto standards - especially the salmon. The rolls come with pretty small pieces but this just means more stomach room to eat other rolls! My only complaint is that the service is super slow - we waited about half an hour in between our first and second orders. They also reduced some of our order portions and forgot a few rolls, but this is typical for ayce sushi places. I'm glad there is now a decent ayce sushi restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is a good place for a buffett! There is a wide selection of sashimi, sushi, seared sushi, cooked (pan fried) plates, tempura, grilled meats, soups, salad, and dessert.  We had a large party and had to wait a while even with a reservation, unfortunately.  The sashimi was fresh, and the other dishes were yummy!  This is a larger restaurant than one would expect, looking in from the street.  Overall, was pleased with the quality of the food. Service could have been better."}
{"text":"the search is over!  this buffet is on par with Tenichi.   after reading reviews on here, I decided to head my way down to Finch and Leslie Friday for dinner.  arrived at 6pm and the place was full already.  I have to say, the speed of service, the accuracy of food order and the quality of food is amazing. even the servers are all pretty nice as well.  empty dishes/plates don't last very long on table.  as soon as i finish swallowing the food, it does not take more than 45 seconds and the empty plates are gone!  2 minor issues with Sushi Legend.  First, the beef with garlic is not as good as the ones made at Tenichi.  Second, they do not have ginger milk as a dessert on the menu.  But, with that being said... Tenichi does not have scallop sashimi and the chicken wings here are pretty amazing as well.    you will not be disappointed here.  the price for 2 with tax is $59 (not including tips).    Will I come back... definitely.  the question is more like, how many more times LOL"}
{"text":"Came here to have dinner, the place was packed, so we could enter only after a 20-minute wait outside (!!) And it was in the beggining of March, so you can imagine.  After we finally were seated, the server gave us all-you-can-eat menu, and it could have been a difficult task to understand how it works, if it wasn't for our friend who knows the system haha. Anyways, the server seemed to jave lost our order, so we waited and waited and waited, for at least 30 minutes for her to bring us beers. Even after we called the server and reminded her that we're still waiting for our food several (!!!) times, it wasn't getting any better! The dishes were brought one by one, and since they're really small and we're hungry, it was like they're taming us like animals. We looked at other people, who came in aftet us and left, while we're still waiting. Situation changed only when we asked for another server, who at least could speak some English.  Even so, the mood was ruined, and I don't think I will go there again. Ever."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a Saturday night.  We made reservations so there were no issues in getting a table.  There is a wide variety of dishes to choose from and the quality of food was pretty good.  Service was friendly and efficient.  I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with the hubby and can definitely say we have found our sushi place! We used to go to another one that we thought was good but this place makes that other seemingly good place look awful! They have the largest variety of sushi, beef, chicken, noodles/rice, and desserts. We would come here just for their beef. They have mushrooms rolled in beef that taste absolutely delicious! Their sushi has a little bit of rice, not alot like most sushi places, which is perfect since its an all you can eat sushi place. Their soft drinks are included in the buffet, and their service is really good. They didnt even charge us for not finishing some food. Love this place and recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly quick, attentive and thorough service for an AYCE restaurant.   $24.95 for a weekend dinner, which features an extended menu with more expensive items (sashimi, scallop sushi, sake mussels, soft-shell crab roll, etc). Pop is included, and it's not the watered-down, flat fountain stuff common at AYCE sushi restaurants - real name-brand Coke products drawn at the proper syrup/soda water ratio.  Atmosphere was nothing special, though the bathrooms were very clean and nicely laid out. The dining room itself is a bit small and cramped, especially for how busy it was. We ended up waiting ~20 minutes for a table for two at 7pm on a Friday night.   Recommendations: Scallop sushi and scallop sashimi Beef ribs (which are cooked to a very pleasing medium-rare) Herb white tuna sashimi Eggplant tempura  Avoid: Sushi Legend fried rice Sake mussel (dry, tough, over-salted) Crazy dragon roll  TL;DR Efficient service, great grill items, simple menu items shine over heavily-seasoned and sauced rolls and entrees."}
{"text":"Best sushi place so far. Everthing from miso soup to sashimi or even edemame is grate."}
{"text":"After reading the raves about this sushi place, I decided to check It out. Honestly it's a typical all you can eat sushi, I've had better. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because service was fast and quality of the food is higher then other AYCE. Nothing special- wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is around 22.25$ after tax now. First one coming is the hand roll. See how small the meat it it! Hope other dishes will have more meat."}
{"text":"This place should never accept reservation on the weekends. It pisses everyone off. The people who reserved never got their seats on time and people who were waiting in line got their seats taken by those reservation. Have some business sense."}
{"text":"Place is small so waited at least 20 min for a table for 2 Friday at 7pm.   Service is quick Menu isn't the biggest I've seen but still had plenty of options Food overall is just ok - passable but I've had better. Sashimi is minuscule. Noodles, soup, grilled/cooked items, all meh. Shrimp tempura was good. Deep fried banana was awful. Ice cream was good.   Total was $60 for 2. Def going elsewhere next time for ayce sushi, knowing there's better out there"}
{"text":"I went for the all you can eat sushi during lunchtime. There was a lot on the menu and the pricing was also pretty good. The sushi rolls come in a variety and the quality is okay. My favourite was the grilled dishes and the desserts.  Halfway through our meal we saw something move on the table and we realized that it was a cockroach. We told the waitress right away and she caught the bug in a napkin. The manager came over to apologize and he said he would give us 50% off. We later realized that the cockroach came from one of the dishes (probably the edamame).  Overall the food was alright and I understand that most AYCE kitchens probably are not too clean but I don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"One of the better AYCE Sushi places in the GTA. The blowtorch salmon and tuna was tasty. Everything was very freash, quality was good. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I don't know why all the good review about this place given the experience I had during my dinner there 2 weeks ago. First off, there were raw eggs(I mean raw, running egg white!) in my food, when confronted, the waitress said it's suppose to be that way. When the second batch of sashimi came, after eating into the 3rd/4th piece, I've noticed BLOOD in my sashimi.  Again we flagged down the waitress asking her about the blood; whether the chef had cut himself.  Again the waitress denied and said that's suppose to be from the fish, its suppose to be fresh.   At that point, I was quit upset & had lost  my appetite all together, I'd replied back in a loud enough voice so tables around me can hear \"I dont care whether it's fish blood or human blood; Sashimi should not have blood in it\" Both my partner & I didnt feel good afterwards whether it's the raw egg or the blood in the sashimi. Worst AYCE experience ever!"}
{"text":"korean style beef ribs and salmon sashimis is very good there!"}
{"text":"First of all, nice iPad ordering service.  Food are not good at all. Poor presentation, it almost felt like the \"chefs\" just threw a bunch of things together onto a dollar store plastic plate. Price is obviously not decent. To be fair, the sashimi is alright, acceptable. The handrolls are not bad too, good proportions. For service, waiters don't really talk to you or have any eyes contact. They usually just put your plate of food at the edge of your table so that you can grab it yourself."}
{"text":"I like hang out sushi AYCE or other Buffets for lunch alone on every Saturday. Sushi AYCE has own special menus (this is 100% my opinion, favorite and other food is normal and lower); Osaka Golden Shrimp at Kenkou sushi, pretty decorated rolls at Sake sushi, well tempura and Thai wok at Aji Sushi and etc. I tried chicken wing skewers. Wow. it is excellent! If you are a wing lover, you must try it. Worst things, it isn't a AYCE. Whatever amount you ordered, all orders are same  such as three or four order for grilled beef ribs were same as two orders. They missed some orders  too. I really wanted and could not taste enoki rolls, the reason to try this restaurant. Parking............... so horrible. I went there 11:10am on Saturday. Try again this restaurant. 90% NO. 10% YES if I miss chicken a wing skewer. one more, they changed price."}
{"text":"One of the top AYCE sushi joints in the Toronto area. They have a lot of specialty items -- beef tataki, yuzu salmon, rock shrimp -- that they don't serve at a lot of other AYCE locations.  The sashimi and sushi rolls are really fresh, and just leaves you wanting more. For those that don't like raw fish, they have a huge selection of cooked/grilled items that are also very tasty.  This place is very busy, and good thing they just opened up a new and bigger location near Huntingwood and Brimley -- will definitely try that location out as well."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with my mom. And good thing we got there when we did. As we were seated and I turned around there were several groups of people waiting for tables.   We ordered right away. I was impressed with how fast the food arrived at the table. I was happy with the decor of the place minus the tablecloth that they used for the tables. It didn't seem to suit a sushi restaurant.   And compared to the Leslie and finch location...this one was quite load. I could hear other tables where they were speaking loudly in Cantonese. There were several big tables so I guess that didn't help.   The food was good not much complaints there. The waitress that we had was tremendous. She was so polite. However the staff that brought out the food wasn't as great. One girl as she brought out the grilled eggplant dish threw it on the table and the soy sauce went everywhere. No apology or anything.   The desserts same as the other location...was pretty good. They offered a 10% discount if you pay cash."}
{"text":"We've been here before for lunch, and dinner kicked lunch's butt, hands down!   The wait to get seated was reasonable considering how busy they were, and the service was on point our entire meal. It was also nice to have the manager check in and see how our meal was.   Speaking of meal, there are no food pics because we inhaled it all too fast. Maybe I'll snap some next time.   I would recommend trying it all, but the following were our faves: Beef tataki Mushroom with butter  Angel roll Sirloin with garlic Grilled shrimp"}
{"text":"Good for a AYCE.  Decent food, sushi was whatever but I enjoyed the warm dishes. Service was quite wonderful. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"THERE IS NO SASHIMI AT LUNCH.    The dinner menu, however, is fabulous.  There is a huge selection and a very wide variety of options available.  Sashimi, sushi, hand rolls, various fried dishes, noodles, fried rice, appetizers, various seafood dishes.  Fountain drinks are free and unlimited.      I highly recommend making a reservation for dinners, otherwise, the wait can be quite long.  Ordering is through an iPad, which they let you keep throughout dinner so you can keep ordering.  The serving sizes are usually by individual piece, which really cuts down on waste- if you only have two people at the table, you can order two pieces of an item rather than getting a minimum of six like most other places.          Service is quick.  Food started arriving within minutes of ordering, and did not stop coming.  They cleared plates fairly quickly, and there was sufficient staff so you didn't really have to search to get refills on drinks.  I don't think they missed a single item we ordered, so they've got the system down really well!    GREAT DISHES Salmon Head - Very juicy, cooked perfectly Torched Salmon Sashimi (rectangle shaped) - With torched mayo on top Fried Squid - The marinade was very nice Fried Noodles - A delicious, delicate smoky flavour Shrimp Tempura - Delightfully soft  Beef Tataki - Tasty  Scallop Sashimi (weekend/holiday dinners only) - Small, but they had that great mild scallop taste   MEH Salmon Sashimi - Very bland, but the texture is good.  Compared to all the other dishes, it's a surprising let down, especially since pricey scallop sashimi was much more flavourful.    Garlic Fried Scallop - Way too garlicky."}
{"text":"This was my boyfriend and I's second time here and we will definitely be back in the future.   The service here was super quick.  As soon as we walked in we were seated and immediately served hot tea.  Once we put our order through,  the food came out in less than 10 minutes!  One of the main reasons why we come here over other sushi places is because if the beef tataki and sake mussels.  Love it!   Customer service is here awesome.  When the servers come to clean up your plans they always say excuse me.. I've never seen that before.  Oh and they clear up your table really quick.   Their desserts are really yummy too. We had ice cream, tiramisu, mango pudding, mango sago, and cream custard (which turned out to be just whipped cream lol).   The desserts come in small shot glasses - I'll attach a picture.   My boyfriend tried to compliment the service when he paid for our meal but she didn't seem to understand.  That's too bad."}
{"text":"Pretty good AYCE Sushi place in the North York area. A ton of variety and a few standout dishes including: the Sushi Legend Fried Rice, the Spicy Scallop Sushi, Beef Tataki, and their Specialty Salmon Sashimi Dish.   I deducted 1 star because the place could be cleaner. There was a watery mouldy smell at our table and we asked to move."}
{"text":"Awesome food, lots of options for the buffet and reasonably priced. The service could be improved."}
{"text":"I do not like AYCE because of the  lack of quality, the uncreative cookie cutter rolls and dishes BUT sushi legend actually wowed me. Obviously it is ayce so you can't compare it to the a la carte places but if you compare it to the other AYCE restos, it is probably one of the best!   We ordered almost everything on the menu lol it was a fun experience an as a ayce-hater, i would actually come back.   My favourites were the rock shrimp, beef tataki, yuzu salmon and chicken wing skewers.  My dislikes - all sushi rolls, the rice was too sticky sometmes gooey, too much vinegar, the rolls with crunchy bits had tons uncooked PANKO which tasted nasty - youre suppose to cook your tempura bits and if you use PANKO please fry it with butter first, panko straight from the box is just bread crumbs. Unacceptable.  -1   We kept getting the wrong order, things we didnt order and we didnt get the takoyaki among many other dishes I had marked down. For example, I marked down 3 shrimp tempura and 1 yam. I ended up getting 3 shrmp tempura, 1 yam AND 2 zucchini, 2 taro lol? This commonly occured and my friends and i ended up accusing each other of over ordering BUT i took a picture of what I ordered before handing it and I was right HA!   The staff definitely needs to improve on getting the customer the correct order and not bring out the wrong items. for that -1star  As for service in general, the staff is friendly and quick. +1 It made up for the 5 items we didnt receive.   To sum everything up, I would definitely come back even though I will not be ordering sushi rolls, there were many items on their menu I loved other than the rolls, lets just hope I receive them hehehehe."}
{"text":"loved this place the last time I went =)  Decor's nice, food's nice, they did forget some dishes, but it was okay =) Overall really nice service!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre, service is lacking, long waiting list, most importantly...they're not very sanitary as they rush to clean things. I find food on the seats and tables aren't properly cleaned. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"This is one of the better all you can eat Japanese restaurants in the GTA for dinner(I've never been to lunch).  Very spacious seating(compared to their Leslie/Finch location), simple ipad ordering system, great selection of sushi/cooked food/dessert.  Sashimi and sushi rolls are decent. Cooked food is above average.  Dessert is quite good. Good cold fountain drinks.  Some highly recommended items to order -beef tataki -sexy summer roll -cheese wonton -steamed egg -sizzling flouder -For dessert: Mango yogurt, custard cream, lychee yogurt, creme brulee   Great AYCE place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"New AYCE place located in Finch & Leslie Square. Went last night for AYCE dinner, and Sushi Legend was suprisingly great! It was 24.95 each with 10% off (which only lasts until the end of this month!) but it was worth it!  Environment:  The interior is nice, clean and not crowded.  Enough space between each table.   Service: Most of the staff speaks Mandarin, but they do understand Cantonese and English.  Service was very good, and the food came very fast, staff were friendly and most of the orders arrived correctly.  Food: Food was overall very delicious and flavourful.  I love all the special rolls, because there they were not big, and not too much rice, and the sauce was delicious!  The tempura were fried very well, crispy and fresh.  Sashimi was pretty good also, even we did not order a lot.  Other items, like the eel fried rice, sushi pizza, and beef sashimi was also very good.  Lots of desserts to choose from, the fried bananas were very good, and the yogurt custard, and mango sayo.  Of course, the ice cream was good! A lot of variety on the menu!  Overall, a very good experience!"}
{"text":"I was just here with some friends. Service was garbage, I asked for water and never got it. They also tried over charging us then got mad when we confronted them. Sushi wasn't even that great. Loblaws has better sushi."}
{"text":"This is a brand new sushi restaurant that just opened a few days ago. The service was excellent, the place looks great and inviting as well.   My brother and I tried the volcano roll which tasted amazing! The AYCE weekend lunch costed about $16.95, it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Worst sushi I've ever had. Rice was so wet that it stuck on my teeth. We ordered five spicy salmon sushi. Every sushi was different in size, and they were falling apart. Other food was just average. Huge disappointment. I do not recommend anybody to go. I usually don't write reviews, but this one I had to."}
{"text":"A good hidden AYCE place in Scarborough. The ipad ordering system is efficient and seating is spacious. Service was normal except for one of the female servers who was very polite when she was bringing over the food. We went for lunch on a weekday so unknown what service might be like during busier times.  Sushi was average-- nothing too extraordinary. Portions were a food size and food was decent and good value.  Pros: Tempura batter was crispy and light so shrimps, zucchini, sweet potatoes and all other veggies were not heavily caked in fried batter.  Short beef ribs were tender and meaty (comes in a portion of 3).  Cons: No tuna was found on the lunch menu. Only white tuna which is very different. There could have been more varieties of fish.  Limited grill varieties (salmon, chicken, beef, eggplants). Skewers include chicken hearts, chicken wings and chicken.  Miso soup was watery (one piece of tofu and one small piece of seaweed)  A good place for friends or families to have a pleasant AYCE dining experience."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I gave up on AYCE sushi a long time ago because every time i go its just an overload of low quality sushi but this place has some pretty awesome food.  Fresh sashimi, non soggy sushi and good variety of appetizers.  most importantly, the only AYCE i know that has scallop sashimi!"}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations. The food is fresh, portions are just the right size and the service is on point! Food started coming out minutes after I placed the order. Definitely making this my regular AYCE joint!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night but have been here on three other occasions; just never had time to write a review. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the bathrooms are relatively clean (important to note because it's usually an indication that the kitchen is clean if the staff can take time to ensure cleanliness in the bathrooms). The food selection here is quite good as well as the portion sizes. I've been to several AYCE Japanese restaurants where the portion sizes (especially rice and noodle dishes) were enormous, you end up getting full from the first round, and don't get to try anything else. The food quality at this restaurant is also very good as the sashimi (scallop and beef sashimi available on the weekends) tasted relatively fresh and the sushi rolls were very good as well. The selection of the hot foods was great as there were several different dishes with beef, shrimp, and octopus. The kids also enjoyed the dessert menu. Service was very good even though the restaurant was full; servers replenished the teapots and collected our empty dishes promptly. I think the dinner price was about $28, which is reasonable for what you get; definitely recommend this place if you like Japanese food."}
{"text":"Able to.maintain the food quality,  very attended staff, friendly, service in good standard, sashimi is always fresh, sushi rolls has the right portion of rice, weekends they serve scallop sashimi,  spicy tuna hand roll, variety of good quality sashimi choices.  reasonable priced and dessert is average."}
{"text":"Have been there many times. This place never disappointed me. Always fres ingredients.prompt service. Clean enviroment. Would go there every week if i lived close by."}
{"text":"This is my go to place nowadays and I've tried many all you can eat places in pickering/ajax and kingston. It has some good sushi and my favourite dish is the korean la galbi, especially because it's offered for lunch!"}
{"text":"always always be my favorite AYCE sushi place. Just no any other place would beat their quality foods. the sashimi are fresh and the hot foods are above average. this place is always packed, but soon you will notice it is worth the wait after you taste their foods.  if they would have more selection of sakes that will be perfect as i am a sake lover :-p. I want to recommend some favorite dishes but i realized i love a lots of them. scallop sashimi I believe they use different grade from other AYCE place, fresher and you can obviously tell they are all jumbo size. the salmon sashimi with herb sauce is in my must eat list...etc.......try them out,  you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to sushi legend numerous times and the quality has not changed at all. Sushi legend has a wide selection of fresh sashimi, high quality meats, and fast service. Our order was accurate every time for a party of 8, which is rare for AYCE sushi establishments. The dinner AYCE buffet has a wide variety of items on their menu. Went on a weekend and the place still had lineups after 8:30pm, they are definitely doing something right. For AYCE sushi this is one of the best options in the area. Definitely check this place out when you are craving AYCE sushi!"}
{"text":"In general, food can be good but if service is slow and terrible to the point where food doesn't come, it's not a restaurant worth going to again. This was the case with this new Sushi legend location at Brimley & Huntingwood.  It took more than 10 minutes after we placed our order for a plate of vegetables to come out. Everything slowly came out at intervals of 3-5 minutes in between each plate.  Our sushi didn't come out until 30 minutes after we placed an order & even then, it wasn't our full order.  We came on a holiday Monday around 1pm and the restaurant was quite full.  Any restaurant can be quick when it isn't busy but the true test is the speed and attentiveness when it is busy. In this case, Sushi Legend has failed. Sushi and food was good overall but comparable to other AYCE joints so I would rather go a place where good food comes out quickly."}
{"text":"Luv this place.   Pretty busy no matter what day u go for dinner.  Lots of variety and the food rocks especially the beef sashimi.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"went for lunch before and went again for dinner, the sashimi were fresh and thick cut the way they are suppose to be and the beef and the scallop sashimi was delishhhhhh!!! The tempura were lightly battered and well fried oh and the fried capelin fishies were tasty too with all the fish eggs inside! also and the all the beef dish I ordered (garlic beef, beef negimaki, beef skewer) were juicy and tender, the grilled squid was very flavourful (ordered twice!) The grilled salmon head was interesting but nothing too special and had too much fat. The special rolls were nice (ordered mango tango, crazy dragon, black dragon, soft shell crab) but then they fill you up quite quickly so I suggest to fill up on the good stuff (sashimi and such) first before getting too much of the rolls. Selection of desserts were pretty good, recommend mango yogurt, mango sago was watery and I could not taste the mango really, ice creams were not bad, standard fare, the tempura banana was interesting to try but nothing to surprise the taste buds, maybe I should have tried to pair warm banana with ice cream! (Neeeeext time Overall good place to stuff my stomach silly! Good food, fast service, nice portions... Well worth the price ($25 weekend dinner) and will probably go again when I feel like going through another food coma lol"}
{"text":"Place is really busy.  We arrived on a Wednesday at 6:30pm and every single table was taken and there were a couple of people waiting.  Fortunately we had a reservation.  An hour later, there were maybe 12 people waiting for tables.  Impressive they are so busy on a Wednesday.  The restaurant itself is a clean, modern décor.  I believe it opened fairly recently.  The AYCE menu is pretty long - lots of options between sashimi, sushi and hot food.  Nice that the price includes dessert and carbonated beverages.  I believe it is $25 for weeknights and $27 for weekends for adults.  The food was good quality and came in good time and accurately.  Service was attentive.  We had quite a variety - sushi, sashimi, tempura, beef ribs and enoki mushrooms wrapped in beef.  All were well prepared.  Overall, I do slightly favour Matsuda but would recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I went here twice (commander blvd) and I love the sunny roll, first I ordered 16 pieces of sunny roll and they brought me 4, then I ordered another 12 and they brought me another 4 pieces, I had to complain TWICE for them after just to bring me another 8 ( even when I wanted more) . Then they explained to me 1 order of sunny roll is 4 pieces, I have been going to the one on Ravel road for 2 years and I have never had this problem, don't go to this location, they think customers don't know how much pieces are per order. It's better to order on paper (Ravel rd) so you can write how much you actually order and write down the total amount of pieces to show that you understand."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for dinner around 5 pm. Food was good but service was slow. And I usually like to see through the sushi bar to watch how they make all kinds of sushi but the layout of this restaurant limits you doing that. You barely can see the sushi bar. Overall, it's a good restaurant but I don't think their sushi is made by any Japanese chief."}
{"text":"Came here a few times. The food was good and the staff is really friendly. The only downside is that sometimes they forget to bring you all of your food. Overall great place."}
{"text":"I liked this AYCE, surprisingly more than I expected.  The food & selection (4.5/5): Sashimi was fresh, the cooked meat was alright, but the rolls were definitely well done in terms of flavour and rice vs. Fish ratio :P A couple things of reasons why I thought this place differed from many other AYCE. 1) their rolls are a lot smaller than most AYCE places, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. They are still well done only on a smaller scale so I got to try more rolls than I usually eat at another AYCE place. 2) a lot of their cooked food comes in a mini version as well... Again their cooked food was cooked, nothing too special but I got to try a lot of it! 3) they have a large selection of desserts. 4) their drinks are unlimited. Loved this. Overall the selection was quite extensive which I liked and I would come back to try more!  Cost (3/5): ~$27 for dinner.. So a bit on the pricy side, but I enjoyed this place a lot and have no qualms about the price I had to pay for dinner.  Service (4.5/5): So their staff wasn't particularly friendly or anything, but we got food FAST. And the restaurant was PACKED with a line up extending out the door. I hate eating at AYCE and then you have to wait for all your food to arrive. We just had fast service all throughout the night, plates were gone in a jiffy when we finished them, so overall really great AYCE experience.  Ambience (4/5): The place has a modern look to it with some decorations that seem random, but the booths are large and roomy for 4 people so it was a great place to eat in :)"}
{"text":"Great AYCE sushi place! It is super busy at lunch time, but the staff do everything in their power to ensure you get quality sushi served to you as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet: Good fish to rice ratio. Most hand rolls come in 4 or 6. Not a lot of specialty rolls. But they have eel for lunch. Drinks are included in the AYCE. Ambience is great. Buffet orders come through the IPAD."}
{"text":"I tried two different locations of this restaurant for a couple of times. But the Scarborough location has more parking spaces, the North York one is always hard to find parking around dinner time and the seating spaces are less than the Scarborough one as well.   If you choose to go there having dinner, better be there before 6pm, or else It's gonna be around at least one hour waiting. I prefer going there at weekends, definitely more selections with more seafood choices.   You can order with an iPad and food being served very quick. Staffs are very nice and helpful. But I found that if you being there for more than two hours, sometimes they don't serve all the food you order, and staffs are constantly coming ask you what else you need and they'll take back the iPad. No idea why but maybe it's a sign for letting us go, maybe ordering too many or being there too long. But overall, staffs having been nice.  But the bad side is that their deserts selections are too limited. So that's why I give it a four star."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and had an all-you-can-eat meal with my family.  The food itself wasn't particularly bad but it wasn't great either, but the tiny portion sizes were really a turn-off for me. After realizing that the dishes we ordered were so tiny, we ordered more, only to wait some more, successfully losing some of our appetites.   The whole thing cost us 77 dollars and in the end, we left the restaurant feeling a tad bit ripped off.   Overall, the decor was nice, the service was okay and the food was mediocre. An alright place to go if you just want to have a casual meal with your friends and/or family."}
{"text":"This place is considered a good AYCE.  Although not as good as Kaka AYCE due to lack of torched sushi, it offers scallop sashimi and unlimited free drinks and these make up for it.    They have some very good speciality rolls, I love the mango rolls and the soft shell crab rolls.  They also have the sushi legend fried rice which is really good as well.  Sashimi is very fresh and don't forget their scallop sashimi because you don't get that anywhere else.  Service is great, food comes out fast and never been told last call.    If you put AYCE sushi places into 4 levels, this one is a level 3 with level 1 being lowest.  Kaka would be a level 4 because it offers torched sushi on top of everything else other places offer."}
{"text":"Great variety of choices on the lunch menu. Everything we ordered was really tasty. The handrolls were perfect and the nori was chewy at all.   Sizes and quantity were perfect for all you can eat. Nothing was overly large to fill you up.  Felt a bit rushed during the end of our meal but it was also noon and there were people waiting at the door.   I'll recommend and definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went their for lunch with bunch friends, which is not a good decision. Most interesting things are in dinner. Service was OK. White tuna was good relatively speaking. Liked the eel rice pizza, very nice flavour. Beef related stuff are little oily"}
{"text":"My family come here very often, usually once a week. The food are very good and besides sashimi, there are a lot selections for cooked foods. So far, We never had any stomach ache or others problem. The place is clean, the service is good and fast too, you should reserve in advance if you come in peak hours otherwise you have to wait for quite a long time. My children loves the herbal Tuna and beef tattaki.  You will be charged dinner price if you want to eat sashimi at lunch time. I think it is the best sushi (all you can eat) restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Worst Service you'll ever get. The food was alright, but your orders are constantly missed and you end up waiting for nothing for 30 minutes. My friends and I went for an AYCE yesterday and 1 hour into the meal they started missing our orders; on purpose or not, I don't know. Every 5 minutes (not exaggerating) the staffs come and ask if we're done with our plates, obviously trying to kick us out. And when we repeatedly told them we're not done with our plates yet they started giving us looks and completely disregarding our orders. Not only that, but everything comes 30 minutes after you've ordered them, leaving us with no choice in the middle of that gap but to order more and hoping something would come to our table.  Not worth the tips."}
{"text":"Went for ayce lunch on a Wednesday. The service was good, . The variety of food is good but very similar to other all you can eat. The interior of the restaurant is really nice and modern looking. Only giving 3 starts because the beef teriyaki was undercooked and raw when they served it, and they forgot some items on the menu."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times already. They are awesome. Food is delicious - my favourite dishes are the salmon pressed sushi and the torched salmon sushi. They are the best - comparable to kaka sushi but at a lower price per person! The only thing is that sometimes they forget your order or if you order the same dish multiple times, they wont bring it all out for you. But that happens at every all you can eat restaurants.   All in all - hands down the best all you can eat sushi restaurant in the Markham/Richmond hill/Scarborough/north York area"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here. The food is good and after you send order on the iPad it comes out really quick. If the order takes a while, you can always follow up and shortly after it'll arrive. Enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"Have eaten a lot of N.A. Sushi in Toronto and this is one of the best there is.  Besides the usual, fresh fish well cut and good amount of vinegar in the rice, there are a lot of extra's that many sushi houses do not add.  Yes it is becoming more common to have green tea included with the meal, but their tea is well brewed and never bitter.  They also include fountain pop at no additional cost, but more importantly the service is very good compared to a lot of other places.  The sashimi is always cut properly portioned well and they have good offerings.  Wasn't too impressed with their selection of hot saki but overall a 5 star experience each time I've visited."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  Great service.  I really like the fact the portions are not to big, so you get to try a little bit of everything without wasting so much food.    The mango yogurt is definitely my fave dessert on the menu.  Banana Tempura, not so much there is no crunch, just tastes like warm banana.  The rock shrimp is amazing, but I think they put way to much mayo I always end up scrapping it off.  The cheese wontons are interesting, very rich a must try.  It can get very busy for dinner so I suggest you make reservations.  Love the seating, it is mostly booths, so you have more room for more food!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal at this Sushi Legend, although not quite as much as I liked the food at the  original Sushi Legend. One thing that this restaurant has in its favour compared to their original restaurant, is a superior interior design and a layout that results in a better traffic flow. Like the first Sushi Legend, you place your order on a paper menu and the staff then enters it on a computer. No mistakes were made when I was there."}
{"text":"I go to Sushi Legend about once a month for the sashimi. In particular, I like the beef tataki, the salmon tataki and the scallop sashimi (available on weekends and holidays). Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"The food is not terrible per se, but its not great either. We found everything was covered in very sugary mayo sauces. Very few menu items were actually good.  you have to order drinks from the server but ours never came back, so thats a bit confusing.  The price was outrageously high for the quality. With 10%tip( who the hell am i tipping $10.00 to btw) $80.00 for two people is crazy!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, once when it just opened and the food did not taste good, second time I thought I would give it another try with my family, and it was just as bad, if not worse because of the service.  I was pregnant into my second trimester at the time and could not eat half the things on the menu, so I asked for the a la carte menu and they did not give it to us until half an hour later because they did not want to since there were around 10 of us and everybody else was eating buffet and we were seated at the same table. It wasn't until my husband complained to the manager that they gave us the menu. After my order finally came, the waiters kept watching us to make sure I wasn't eating anything from the buffet menu.  Overall, the food is shit, and the service isn't great so I would never come back or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"So back in my university days, we frequented AYCE (all you can eat) sushi joints often. We would find a new place to try (thank goodness for student loans) and eat until we couldn't walk anymore. However, after growing up and realizing that these things cost money, I haven't been able to go out as much as I used to. But my boyfriend and I do occasionally enjoy going out binging and seeing how much we can polish off.  Over the years, I've had quite a number of go-to AYCE. But it wasn't until about a year ago I stumbled across Sushi Legend. One of the pricier AYCE places, this joint is worth the money.  Their beef tataki is amazing. The super thin cut slices of beef paired with the citrus ponzu sauce is beautiful. The delicacy of the beef adds to the wonderful experience of the dish. The only downside is that sometimes the meat and the plates are quite cold (straight out of the fridge/freezer) and the tataki doesn't taste as good when it's in a frozen state.  They also offer salmon yuzu which uses the same ponzu sauce and it's just as delicious. The outside of the salmon has been quickly seared but the inside is still raw and tender. I do prefer the beef over the salmon because the sauce does become a bit overwhelming when you're expecting the freshness of the fish to come out.  On Fridays and Weekends for dinner, they offer scallop sashimi. The pieces are cut inconsistent but the freshness makes up for that. The pieces of scallop are so subtle and they just melt in your mouth. They also have spicy scallop sushi but I find that the spicy mayo takes away from the natural flavours of the delicate scallop.  Since this is a place that focuses on quantity (as do most AYCE joints), I've noticed that the rolls do get messy when you order a lot of them. The spider roll (soft shell crab) is much better when you order it when it's an off-peak time (such as during lunch because it's not included in their lunch AYCE menu and they'll deep-fry the crab as per order).  One of the surprising dishes I enjoy is the grilled chicken hearts. They're not overly chewy but soft and tender. The sauce they marinate the hearts in is a sweet sauce that isn't too overpowering. However, if you don't enjoy the slight taste of iron, I wouldn't order the hearts. Some other stand out dishes include the rock shrimp, stir-fry beef diced with garlic, grilled squid, and beef teriyaki.  Overall, this place is pretty good. It's a bit pricey ($24.95 for dinner Monday-Thursday, $26.95 for dinner on Friday, weekends & Holidays) but it's along the lines of most AYCE places these days. Sushi Legend is my new go-to place and as long as they keep having great food, I'll keep visiting.  (I've tried both locations for Sushi Legend multiple times- food quality is about the same, between the two locations, I prefer the Leslie/Finch location over the Brimley/ Huntingwood one)."}
{"text":"Headed here with my family on the day after New Year's Eve for the lunch buffet. We were seated very quickly without a reservation. We came in what seemed to be the lunch rush (around 2pm) and our first round of orders came in reasonably quickly (items appeared one by one over the course of 10-20 minutes), and once the restaurant had settled down around 3pm food came almost immediately.  The waitresses are mostly young students, but very polite and professional. Service was excellent (you just had to be a little more proactive to get their attention when the place was busy).  The food itself was excellent and always beautifully presented, especially for an all-you-can-eat place and definitely the best value for the price that I've ever seen ($15/person for the lunch buffet on a holiday). Portion sizes are good for sharing and small enough that you can sample a bit of everything, so don't go overboard ordering 2 or 3 of the same item before you've tried a couple of different things. They also levy a charge on any uneaten food, which is completely reasonable given the quality of the items available on the lunch buffet menu.  Favourites: rock shrimp, volcano roll, eel roll, beef teriyaki, banana tempura. But everything we ordered was yummy.  Add in the tasteful modern décor, interesting wall art, and clean, spacey tables and booths...can't be beat!! Give this place a go."}
{"text":"I like it.  lunch price is pricey.  but I like the food, good variety, good quality.  I will go back often.  Best all you can eat in north york suhi."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place and to be quite honest I don't think I can rate it fairly when I wasn't able to try dinner as I currently have a bun in my oven...seemed pointless to go for dinner when I can't eat the best part...sashimi. Wasn't too thrilled that the price had gone up again. I read a bunch of the reviews and this seemed to be the 2nd time. My family totally left the ordering up to me. I got us grilled eggplant, tempura shrimp and vegetables, seafood salad and house salad. We really liked the short ribs and I was the least impressed with the shrimp tempura roll and mango pudding. The mango and green tea ice cream was ok. Pretty sure I won't be back. I think I'll be sticking to yangs kitchen in markham."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for AYCE sushi. I probably come here once a month. They've recently switched from ordering with a server to ordering sushi from an iPad. This system is much more efficient. I found that before it was just harder to get a server and some of the servers didn't take orders and that was confusing.   The sashimi i find here is fresh and they've also recently gotten torched sushi. This means that the prices here went up too. Yesterday we had dinner for 3 people and it came to about $98. I like this place because they take visa/mastercard/debit/cash and charge the same price. They also do not auto add 10% to your bill.   The food comes out fast. Taste great and the selection is pretty big. They do have some items that are weekend pricing only. i.e. baked scallops with garlic  Overall, I do enjoy eating dinner here. Never had their lunch.   Just a tip. If you come after 6:30/7 pm you will most likely have to wait for a table. It's busy here even during the weekday. They do take reservations so i highly suggest you make one if you're here with a big party."}
{"text":"I read the other reviews and heard from others that sushi legend was worth trying but  I was very disappointed.   The highly recommeded scallop sashimi was icy and bland. It tasted more like an ice cube. Even their salmon sashimi was disappointing. It wasn't fresh at all and looked like it's been out for a while.   Cooked items like the okra and shrimp tasted more Chinese than Japanese, marinated heavily with soy sauce and garlic.   The physical location was okay. It was spacious and servers were nice. Good for large groups."}
{"text":"I came with a friend for lunch one day for their AYCE lunch menu. One thing you'll notice right away is the swiftness of the service by the staff. They try to get things done ASAP to move people along without being exceptionally pushy, a hallmark of an effective restaurant.   The food served is your average fare for an AYCE restaurant, which is completely fine. As I always say, if you come to an AYCE looking for the top-notch quality food you've come for the wrong reason. The service may take a bit longer when it's fully filled, so make sure you get everything you want the first time. They're pretty good at making sure they fill your order.   Overall, a solid spot for AYCE sushi and Japanese-style cuisine for your buck. I would definitely stop by again in the future."}
{"text":"With prices slightly higher than the average AYCE sushi restaurant, I expected the quality to be higher as well. That very well was not the case.   We were seated near the door and all night, a gust of cold wind would interrupt our dinner, so I put my jacket back on.   Some of the things that stood out from their menu: scallop sashimi (diced to small pieces) and steamed egg. The sashimi, especially the salmon, was sliced in such chunky pieces I felt like I was eating a raw piece of salmon filet instead of sashimi.   The sushi pieces were soggy and warm, not to mention they also fell apart easily. It didn't matter what we ordered, the presentation and size of the sushi was just so unappetizing.   I enjoyed the steam egg and their beef ribs are quite good, however, we had to eat through conversations between the servers in Mandarin about how this one table is still ordering and complained about them openly. When half your customers are Asian, I really don't suggest this type of behaviour..   Either way, I don't  know if I'll be back here."}
{"text":"This restaurant wasn't my favourite AYCE restaurant. I liked that it was larger and more spacious than most but the lunch was more limited than most, especially when it came to cooked kitchen items. The sushi was also just standard. Overall it's an okay place if you're nearby, parking is a bit difficult and I suggest making a reservation if you do."}
{"text":"I think the best thing about Sushi Legend is the fact that it's still relatively new. The bulb lights look like octopus arms or octopus egg sacs, dangling down from high ceilings into the relatively spacious room that features table seating in the centre flanked by booth tables. The modern decor and clean furniture makes it feel a bit fancier.   The food: it's OK. I'd say it's standard AYCE expectations that have been met. There are a few premium, weekend dinner only items like scallop sashimi and beef tataki - the scallop's alright, not fishy or anything but doesn't taste particularly sweet. It's also sliced very thinly, so an order of four slices is actually only one scallop. The beef tataki looks better than it tastes, and is a crapshoot in terms of sizing: I just ordered a second round of beef tataki and each beef slice is the size of a stick of gum (smaller than our first round). The yuzu salmon is very thinly sliced salmon with a tiny squeeze of citrus.   I can take it or leave it. Its alright, but not quite legendary."}
{"text":"the best sushi ever, the most unique rolls, quality ingredients, excellent staff and service, must come back!! puts sushi on the level of heaven"}
{"text":"Had a really good time here.Good tasting food and a wide variety of dishes available.Their sushi is fresh and their service is really good.You gotta try their  Legend favorites!Make sure you make a reservation as it was really busy on a Saturday night.Definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi in town! Great quality, good service, lots of choices! Rose rolls are the best. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I visited with my friends. It had a long line and I had to patiently wait for my turn. The food came very quickly. I loved how I could order everything from the iPad. The servers were efficient. I especially liked the salmon rose, sushi, and grilled meats. I did not like how some food had \"fillers\", for example hand rolls had much rice than I would've liked, and rolls had fried tempura bits. I guess it is usual for most Japanese AYCE."}
{"text":"For an AYCE dinner, this place is pretty decent and better than I expected coming from some random Chinese spot in Scarborough. On the right of this big restaurant is a big Dollarama store and a big Chinese supermarket. On the left is a big Chinese restaurant. Saying this restaurant is big might be an understatement because this place is actually BIG.  I liked the teriyaki here. The nigiri and the maki are mostly standard stuff so that's good. They also have oshi(pressed) style sushi which is my favourite kind of sushi, and I don't see it in many AYCE places. They sushi pizza is delicious, but they lacked variety in that just a bit. They torch some of their sushi so that's cool.  The hot sago desert is definitely a bonus. I may come again with friends."}
{"text":"This is a regular hang out lunch place for my group of my friends because we are close to the restaurant. We come about 3-4 times a year. Based on the last couple of experiences, the service has been getting worse and worse since they first opened. We'll probably stop going because we've just been so frustrated.   Major complaints my friends and I have: - They always get our order wrong, at least 3-4 times each visit (we noticed it at the other tables too). - They forget our order....especially for salmon, happened more than once. Understandable if it's the last thing they bring up since it's the most expensive, but they usually forget or give us less than ordered (every time!!). - Service is EXTREMELY slow. Today, we realized that our table was empty for longer than it had food on it... at least they're quick with clearing the dishes.   Pro: - Large variety of food to choose from. - Clean & staff aren't rude.  We still go to Sushi Legend because it's conveniently located. Food quality is average, nothing to complain about. I just wish their service was better/faster. We usually have to spent 2+ hours there because we're literally sitting there waiting for food more than half the times.   Conclusion: If you're in the area, want sushi, and have a lot of time to kill, or want a lot of time to chat with friends over a meal, it's definitely an option. But if you're on a time crunch and just want to get in and out stuffed with food, there are better options in the plaza."}
{"text":"Very good food. Service fast and staff very friendly. We ordered the fire roll and it is great. The place clean and nice atmosphere ."}
{"text":"If all you can eat means you order 4 pieces and they only give you two, and u order 10 more and they only give you 6, then I should only have to pay half of the menus price shouldn't i?  Don't get me wrong, the food is alright, (only if u can actually get it on your table,)but I wouldn't call it best in this neighbourhood, if u want better then go to warden n steeles they have ayce called Yokohama, way better.  In the meantime I'll just keep ordering until I can get what I ordered and get full, and all the poor folks in line just will have to wait."}
{"text":"Love this place...The quality of sushi is really good and fresh.. Customer service is good...Love that they have incorporated iPads into their ordering system.."}
{"text":"My first experience using an iPad to order in Scarborough what a bonus! Lol   I like this place.  There's pressed sushi here that's lightly torched so that's something new for me in these parts! There's also a taro sago dessert that I haven't seen before either. Either I haven't been to enough ayce sushi spots to catch up on the new stuff or these items are reaaalllly special! Well ya got me Sushi Legend so you'll see me many more times!   Tatami use to be my ayce spot in Scarborough but now...#sorryNotSorry this my go-to spot now! :p"}
{"text":"I must say this is one of the worst experience I had at an AYCE sushi place. Half of the orders were cut and the grilled stuff we ordered contain mostly fats or it was rare or medium rare. The service was okay. Highly recommend the beef tataki and herb white tuna sashimi. I would not visit this place ever again due to the grill stuff not being cooked properly. The price was fairly expensive."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Forgot our orders twice. Waited an hour for food. Found 2 pieces of hair in our noodle dishes. Some food didn't seem fresh."}
{"text":"Went here with my fiancé's cousins. There's so much to choose from with the lunch menu and it came to like 18 dollars. One unique thing is that the pop is AYCE  too! The only complaint is when I ordered tiramisu it was a tiny spoonful. I had to order 4!!"}
{"text":"As a family with two kids, we LOVE coming this location. All the dishes are so well presented and delicious.  After coming several times, my husband organized a surprise milestone birthday party with the extended family for a party of 15.  The service was spectacular and the food just keeps coming.  Most celebrations now take place here.  Totally recommend trying this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The first restaurant I went to upon returning to Canada was...Cngee Wong.  The second place was here, Sushi Legend, because I was WHATTT Finally a sushi restaurant with the Leslie & Finch area. I had suspicion that this restaurant was owned by the same people who owns the Congee Wong/Queen/Sugar mini empire, and my suspicion were confirmed after seeing Kinky walking around here gathering opinions from the patrons. Kinky was this waitress who started with the first Congee Wong next door in 2000, and without telling you anything, she is now a part owner in the whole business. Kinky is sexy, man. Come to think of it, I've been going to Congee Wong since it opened, that's in 2000, and I was thirteen.  Kinky practically watched me grow up.....or eat my way thought my youth...not that my youth is over or anything..  Yo, I had the most amazing sushi in China, at one of those rotating belt restaurants, so my expectation really ain't high now that I'm back in Canada.  Sushi Legend, I think it's a horrible name.  But let's talk about the good things, because I'm on this positive good energy thing since coming back.  The decor is not bad dude.  First time I've seen drop pod lights, some mirrors.  it's not thoroughly thought-out, but it ain't bad man.  The seating plan doesn't feel too scattered, and the ambiance..well, let's just say for a Japanese restaurant, there is ambiance.  That's cool man.    It's all you can eat, and the sushi (for now) is reasonably fresh and well prepared.  They could be a little more generous with the avocado as it is pretty thinly sliced on the avocado rolls, and there's been a few times where I made my order, it and didn't come.  The chicken heart skewers are damn good, and the sashimi  ain't too shabby either. Bento boxes, fried rice, ramen/udon, and rolls...like over 168 items or something.  Service is fast too.   I swear these guys are going to own the entire complex, if that travel agency closes, the whole building will be restaurants by the same owners.  In the end Kinky got us to try all of the desserts, and she gave me a discount...because she watched me grow up yo!  That's some MAMA sh*%"}
{"text":"Expensive for AYCE lunch. Approx $16. I liked how they left a tea pot on the table so we could refill when needed. Tried a variety of fish, photo added is of salmon, white tuna, squid, and mackerel. Fish was fresh, but I've had nicer salmon. Rice was warm - this is a huge let down for me when it comes to sushi places, but it was SO busy I can see why it would happen."}
{"text":"It's like most of the all you can eat sushi out there, nothing special about this place. Service was very slow last time when I visited. Why do I need to wait 15 minutes to half an hour for food? Avoid coming here if you have that much time."}
{"text":"This place is definitely popular and packed - for a Monday night it was a full house. For a large group, I would call to make reservations.  I can't seem to tell the difference between these AYCE Sushi places, and this one will probably get lost in the shuffle. I came here because my carpool driver wanted to take our family out and we decided on this place. Seating is great if you get a booth, and there are plenty of them so one star for that!   Signature paper menus for you to check off which dishes you want and quantity. The orders are quite small sized which allows you to order a variety of dishes without feeling immediately full. Small plates also ensures less food wastage which I am always for that. Our table ordered signature AYCE items such as rolls, hand rolls, ramens and udons, and yes, sushi/sashimi. We ordered lots of the Salmon sashimi so we definitely got our Omega's.  I have to say service is efficient. Plates are continuously brought and cleared at the same time. Tea jugs are constantly full. 2 stars just for the seamless service in that regard. I noticed all the staff that served our table spoke Mandarin which points to the clientele that come here.   I wouldn't come out of my way here, and it wouldn't be my first choice for AYCE, but if you happen to be in the area...  FYI - The parking area right outside this restaurant is chaos. Parking lines are not meant to be followed which means you have to park in a way that your car crosses, almost to the middle, the yellow lines. The next trend I suppose...  Also, if you're feeling ridiculously full, you can walk off the food at the supermarket close by. It sells house slippers for $1!!"}
{"text":"I always compare every decent AYCE to 168 Sushi which is my go to \"$15\" lunch buffet but I guess I have to rethink that approach because 168 has been steadily increasing its prices in the past few years. I believe it's at $16 now without the drink. For this reason I have to rate Sushi Legend at the same level. Same prices, but with drinks included. Same overall quality of food, more variations of rolls, and slightly lower kids prices.  Compare to 168 the cons would be: -not as much variation of food, but they do have a lot -parking is a bit tougher -no ipad ordering -not as big dining space. Bringing strollers is a bit of a hassle though doable.  The service was alright, overall a pleasant experience. 4 star average is fair."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend, very busy had to wait 20 mins to get seated and had to share a table, which I don't mind but they kept mixing up which party ordered what which was understandable.  IPads for ordering is awesome but none of the food really surprised me here, typical ayce sushi that we challenge ourselves to eat as much as possible, only plus is that its not too far from my home and they bring the food out quickly.  basic ayce spot but will return"}
{"text":"This place looks pretty nice. I'm a fan of the decor but it pretty much stops there. The menu is pretty decent, the iPad at the table for ordering is a nice touch and the food is decent. I've definitely had worse all you can eat sushi before. That said, the service is straight up terrible. If you're set on coming here be prepared to wait longer than reasonable and watch people who arrived after you get served before you. And just because you order something doesn't mean you'll get it. We had 3 items never come, plus our bill never came despite asking for it twice and 3 bills after ours went to their tables. I'd have given it all 1 star but the food at least earned it an extra."}
{"text":"Went to there on Monday night.  AYCE with tax and tip $70. Drinks are included,you don't have to pay extra. Sushi and sashimi are fresh. The beef rib is so good, well marinated and very tender. They serve food so fast."}
{"text":"Went with my family for dinner on a Monday evening. Price was good for AYCE - food is extremely fresh. You can tell the difference in quality versus other AYCE sushi places like Matsuda on Don Mills or Heart Sushi at Fairview Mall. Service was good, albeit lots of the waiters speak/understand minimal English. Food came quickly and waiters were always available for assistance if needed. Lots of selection from their menu - not only sushi, but they have small appetizers. Would recommend and would definitely return."}
{"text":"I tried this place 2 years ago actually but I really liked it. They have a broad selection of sushi. The sashimi was very fresh and the service was great. I recommend dinner over lunch. The parking situation can be tricky there as it is a busy plaza."}
{"text":"Came here a few times and the service seem to be getting worse. First time service was fast and servers were nicer...but last time they were slow and kept on omitting some items. The servers started just putting stuff on random corners of the table were you couldn't reach  (basically, they just dump the food on the table  without consideration of the diners). I think they don't have enough menu choices and all the maki rolls seems to taste the same..bland. Quite disappointed overall."}
{"text":"I thought this place was ok. Definitely not a favourite. Who I eat here again? Depends on prices of other places relative to this place.  I came here today for lunch. I thought the decor was nice. Place is clean.  For $20.95 (lunch-weekday), you get an all you can eat plus unlimited pop like Coca Cola, Sprite, ice tea. Obviously no sashimi like any other lunch place. They also gave you a teapot with hot tea.  Selection: 3.5/5 it's ok. Nothing spectacular. It had same things like other all you can eat, but it lacked other things. Biggest complaint: the grilled food all tasted like teriyaki sauce. I thought it all taste the same. I wish they have other favours.  Service: 4/5 they were quite busy so service wasn't this quickest. But for an Asian place, service is excellent.   Flavour: 3/5 maybe I'm just being mean because I don't really like sushi but I wasn't a big fan of their sushi rice. I thought there was a little bit too rice vinegar... Or it was just me. I think the fish quality is great for an all you can eat. Their deep fried food like fried scallop was 5/5 because everything was freshly fried and crispy.  Overall: 3/5 because the sushi rice wasn't my favourite and it really bothered me. Plus I thought it was a bit pricey for lunch weekday... I don't think it's worth the price...   By the way: they accept credit card"}
{"text":"One of my go-to AYCE places as the food and variety is good. I came on a Friday night ($27.95 per adult). I have been pleased with my previous visits, however my most recent visit was a bit disappointing.   We were ordering our items and enjoying our time here, however we noticed that our order for the soft shell crab roll from the first order never came to us. We told the server and he took note of it, however it still didn't come (after our 3rd round). It wasn't until near the end, when we had to tell a different server that our roll didn't come, did it finally come after he manually input it into the computer. But the roll was disappointing. There was only a very small amount of crab and the roll did not look very good. It didn't taste extraordinary. I've had better.   The beef short rib is usually my favourite, but this time the meat was too fatty. Also, the sake mussels were slightly overcooked.   Our other orders (grilled eggplant, sweet potato tempura and takoyaki) from the first order also didn't come. We had to tell the server again. Near the end when we ordered dessert, did the takoyaki and grilled eggplant finally arrive. The sweet potato tempura never came to us.  I will give this place another try since my previous times here, the service wasn't like this. The food is good and there are a lot of good points and must tries to this AYCE: - scallop sashimi (it was quite delicious and fresh) - beef tataki (although I wasn't a fan of it) - gui ling gao (in the dessert menu - not something I've seen at other AYCE places) - takoyaki tastes really good (the flavour is on point!) - grilled squid (reminded me of night markets, it was very tasty, wasn't too chewy at all) - grilled eggplant (there's a sweet sauce and it is grilled nicely) - chicken wing skewers (they're so good!, the wings are skewed on so the bones are pushed down) - pop is included in the menu (so no extra charge for all you pop lovers!)"}
{"text":"Food and service was pretty good. They forgot several items during the second round so that does explain the lack of stars. The cheese wontons I ordered looked fairly stingy in size, so portions were alright, nothing amazing. Overall, okay place for lunch, wouldn't say that for dinner though since forgetting items is inexcusable, especially with an ipad system. I would come again, in hopes that they wouldn't forget certain dishes."}
{"text":"My family and I went to this restaurant first time in Toronto. We are original in chicago, IL. And I had ate everything in the menu that we ordered. The price are very reasonable and foods are very excited."}
{"text":"Pretty decent AYCE in Scarborough. Order is through the ipad so they will not so the standard ignore your ass after an hour of eating. Food is consistent and will give you the quantity you ordered. They served everything from Chinese, Japanese to Korean. Pop is included as well. There are plenty of servers around so food gets out quick. Very helpful servers and cheerful people. Prices are pretty standard from other AYCE places. Plenty of parking in the plaza,  I would park a little further as plenty of Asian drivers around. Have gone back twice already. Give a try if you feel like AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Small and cozy not ideal for parties of 10 or more.   I came here for dinner on a weekday with a party of 3.  This my first time here, I go to the Scarborough location as it is closer to me. I came to this location because it was closer for my old colleagues to get to after work.  The food quality is good for ayce, went to eat at sushi legend 5 times and never had a bad food quality experience yet.  They are not short on selection as they always have something new added to their menu.  This place uses the iPad to order food so no time wasted on waiting for a server to take your order. If you want drinks, you will have to ask the server for that for some strange reason even though it's on the iPad as well.   The only drawback of this location is the parking availability, very hard to find parking in this plaza."}
{"text":"I am a firm believer that you can effectively gauge the quality of a good sushi restaurant by the number of Japanese people eating there, the same way you can tell a good Fish n' Chips spot by the number of old British people enjoying food there.  Well, this place has been SLAMMED with Japanese folk every single time I've gone, and for good reason. Service is quick, efficient, prices are reasonable, the mackerel sashimi isn't partially FROZEN when brought out (yes, that's happened to me...), and the tempura... Oh god the tempura. This is my go-to sushi spot when I'm feeling like eating to the point of having to be rolled out of the restaurant. Definitely a must-try for sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Food is very good for AYCE but the service is extremely slow and as there are other AYCE at comparable prices with much better service I'd recommend them first."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with coworkers yesterday.   I was on the fence with giving this place four or five stars. However, I think they deserved five on this occasion based on the value for food, cleanliness and service.   Party of five.   The food:  First, let me start by saying that I eat sushi quite often, with my favourite spots being jabistro and gals sushi.   My review is based on sushi legends lunch special.   I chose the sashimi bento box (BB7 for $11.95). It came with sashimi (was supposed to come with 8pc, but they gave me 12 pc *heart eyes*), miso soup, salad, 3 pc California roll, 3 pc spicy salmon roll, 2 pc shrimp tempura, dessert and rice.   The sashimi - 4 pc of surf clam, 4 pc salmon, 4 pc white tuna (butterfish?). All were the right temperature and good sizes. The salmon was not perfectly cut, but aside from that all the sashimi was fresh and had a nice flavour. They gave me extra pieces which was a nice bonus. Between this location and their Leslie location (which I have had AYCE a month ago), I felt this location had better sashimi.   The rolls - California rolls are California rolls. I would never order them separately, but they were a nice addition. The spicy salmon rolls were better, and I wish it just came with 6 pcs of this instead of 3 Cali and 3 salmon. They came out as a good size, and I like that the don't use too much rice in their rolls.   Shrimp tempura - My normally mild shrimp allergies have been acting up lately, so I had to give these to my coworker to eat. I didn't know I could substitute it for veggie tempura for free! Darn it, my fault for not asking first. Anyway, he loves shrimp tempura so this may be a bit biased. He gobbled it all up quickly and said they were hot, had the right crunch to them and was most happy that he could double dip in the tempura sauce.   Miso soup - hot, came out quickly. I don't know how anyone can get this wrong  Salad - I did not care for the dressing. It was a bit too thick for my liking. Maybe they can think about using a different dressing or giving a different side in place of this. The salad was the only \"meh\" item.   Dessert - choice of vanilla, mango, red bean or green tea. I got the green tea, it was super creamy! The spoon went through it so easily, but it was still nice and cold. Nothing melted, and I'm a slower eater. No frost bite happening over here.   2 ppl got the beef teriyaki bento box (BB4 $10.50) , both admitted that the beef was cooked very nicely. Medium, juicy and tender.   Another person who really wanted to get AYCE lunch, but couldn't because we didn't have the time got the maki set b (MCB $13.95). He also got a side order of salmon sushi (4 pc). He turned out to be really full and satisfied.   Another person got a green dragon roll and a hand roll (unagi? Can't rmb which sashimi they chose). They really enjoyed their meal as well.   The service:   We arrived at noon and were seated quickly. The waitress asked us a la carte or ayce, after choosing a la carte, she updated the iPad menu for us. The only issue I had with this is that we were then sharing 1 menu when ordering a la carte. Which for lunch, kind of sucks when you're with four other ppl.   The only other downside to this is that you have to flag the waitress down in case you need to make any minor substitutions. The reason why this wasn't a bigger deal is because once we got the server, she was able to switch 3pc California roll and 3pc spicy salmon roll to 6pc avocado cucumber roll for one person in our party. We were not charged extra for it which is another plus.   They also promptly brought two big thermal zojiroshi pitchers with complementary green tea in them. I actually like this because I drink a lot of tea and don't like asking or waiting for refills. The temperature of the tea was just right. It wasn't scalding hot and I was able to drink it immediately after pouring it.   The food came out really quickly. All of it came out correct and exceeded our expectations for lunch.   The whole restaurant was clean! Everything about it was clean. Makes you confident that the owners care about the place and the people that come to it.   Overall experience:  We will be back for lunch. Not the best sushi/sashimi I've had, but the value is great for the quality they are serving. I hope this place keeps this type of quality up!"}
{"text":"I have a \"go to AYCE\" but this place is now a number two place to go to.  The big reasons are as follows:  The AYCE MENU is big Scallop sashimi is a plus Beef tataki! Pop is on the AYCE menu... Therefore free refills!!! Salmon sashimi is thick! Bite size ramen... And it's pretty good!  Look, the bottom line is that I found a place north of the 401!  Most likely will come back!!!!  ?????: 8/10"}
{"text":"The best All-you-can-eat for Japanese Food! Omg! I could say only \"I love it!\" I wish I could find One like this in downtown but it seems like I'm not gonna find one. It might be the rental in DT is more expensive so they can't afford to give us generous variety and portion of food like in this restaurant. I live in DT though but I come here at least once a month to visit my family. They recommended this place. They said its new one and they like it. Everything is awesome! My favorite is SHRIMP TEMPURA! My family said other beef dishes were good but I don't eat meat though, only seafood. Soft drinks are included, also dessert YumYUM!! I'll go back there again for sure. Even now I really want to eat there again (sigh) T^T pls open another one in DT  Ps. The waitress was great. She was nice to my nieces. My mom told me that waitress always takes care of them every time when they come! Thank you you guys for good service. Unfortunately! They were packed and we had to leave earlier (we wanted to stay for a while :P just too full) anyway, I do understand the business. Thumb up for food and that waitress!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for typical AYCE. But they just raised their prices for lunch buffet it used to be $12.99+ tax now it's $15.95 (almost $16+tax and tip you end up shelling out $20 for a mediocre AYCE. Prices went up service hasn't changed so not entirely impressed."}
{"text":"This place was awesome...! great atmosphere & ambiance plus on top of that when you order food using a tablet as soon you sent it... the order arrives at 10-15 mins."}
{"text":"The three things I liked about this AYCE restaurant is how friendly the staffs are, how quickly the food comes to our table, and the quality of the food is pretty good.  Now, the reason that made my experience not as enjoyable as I hoped for it to be was, how the restaurant is somewhat dirty.. I wasn't really comfortable with the smell that the tables gave out when I first sat down.  I later on found out the reason, it was because I witnessed one of the waiters cleaning the table with a cup of tea that the previous customer drank from; He literally dumped the cup of tea onto the table and wiped it with a cloth."}
{"text":"Came here for a weekend AYCE lunch. Sushi was below average for an AYCE place, the salmon was quite tasteless and didn't seem fresh. However, the fried/grilled foods (tempura, short ribs, etc.) were not bad, it was quite hot and not too oily. Service was not great either, we asked for more sauce and napkins TWICE and the server walked by several times and never brought it to us. Lunch AYCE includes pop, but the price is relatively higher than other AYCE places. Hence, I would not return again as there are many better and more convenient options in the area."}
{"text":"[Service] It was a little difficult to get their attention when we first walked in but otherwise service was okay. They gave our party 10% off because it was my birthday, so make note of that!  [Food] As some of you might know, AYCE restaurants are more about quantity and quality. I feel that Sushi Legend produces good teriyaki dishes, mediocre sushi, and great dessert. I will recommend that you order A FUCKING LOT on your first menu sheet because believe it or not, the first installment is always better in quality. I'm going to tell you why, our second installment was filled with sashimi that wasn't as fresh and even my dad could tell you the difference (and trust me, he sucks at this stuff). The dessert is quite good, so make sure you order the creme brulee. Otherwise I think the restaurant boasts the same quality as their first one, if not better. I know I reviewed KAKA previously but this place is cheaper and my parents would rather come back to Sushi legend than KAKA."}
{"text":"Good but a tad tight spaced A.Y.C.E. Sushi. Food was fresh except miso soup was watered down and edamame was lacking salt and dry. Servers are friendly and the food comes out quickly! haven't been to the washroom so I can't say how it's like.  Ps, warning, if you get cold easily, avoid sitting near the windows or near the front door :)"}
{"text":"Weekend sushi buffet lunch (as usual!). Feel like finally found a sushi buffet place in GTA where I can go more than twice! Their yam rolls are filled with all yam, not like other places where they made yam rolls mostly with tempura crunches.  Their sexy summer roll was great too, topped with mango sauce and has mango inside.  Other dishes like grilled salmon, fried tofu, chicken skewers are also recommended.  Their dinner menu looks great, maybe will try it next time.  Service was good the waitress girl who served our table was nice."}
{"text":"Once in a while, a binge on as much food as you can eat is absolutely needed. Now, that food isn't always the best quality, but you make up for it by stuffing your face. Sushi Legend is different.   The location is not as large as I would have expected with the name 'Sushi Legend', but there were still a good amount of tables. We were lucky when we arrived that we didn't have to wait, but there was definitely a large group of people waiting before and after us.   With more variety than most other places, they definitely have a lot of good quality food that you can eat as much as you want!  A lot of the food was very good and they had lots of things that many other AYCE restaurants don't offer.  Most notably, they have tataki on the menu and the Beef Tataki was actually quite good! Totally ate like 4 plates myself!  Service was about average, as it was as good as any other AYCE place. They staff mostly just shepherded food and plates to and from the kitchen.   A great location for AYCE, and it will most likely be one of the restaurants that I will go back to with other friends!"}
{"text":"For everyone complaining about seating. Just go there at 6:30p.m. and you will find no issues.  The scallop sashimi is definitely the kicker. Go on a weekend and go wild.   This place has really quick service and I actually love the smaller atmosphere. It is much more intimate. Also, I love the smaller pieced sashimi because it's more bite size and honestly, all you need to do is order more if you didn't have enough, I don't see it as much of a problem.."}
{"text":"I don't visit Toronto much so perhaps you shouldn't trust my review of the sushi in comparison to other places in Scarborough or the greater Toronto area, but GOOD GOD this was the best all you can eat sushi I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Wow is this place ever popular!  Waited 40 min for a seat.  For $26pp + tax and tip, this is one of the more expensive AYCE places.  Food was largely unremarkable, except for the beef sashimi which was amazing (I don't even eat beef but I made a 10 gram exception) and some of the sauces that were used with the grilled dishes.  Oh but was the dessert ever TERRIBLE!!!  I tried every single one (yes, I was a pig - shush, I felt obligated to get my money's worth) and the only one that was remotely ok was the mango pudding.  The \"tiramisu\" tasted like cream in a shot glass.  The mango tapioca was like barely flavoured water (tinted light orange with little balls floating around - I hope you don't drink water like this normally)"}
{"text":"Went here with my mom and sister on a Sunday night. We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table as the place was packed. The portion sizes were small and the food was just okay. The sushi pieces were warm and the sashimi tasted fine. There was nothing special about it. The octopus was really chewy - I could barely bite a piece off. The enoki beef was really dry and chewy as well. One thing that really bothered me was how their menu indicated that the agedashi tofu is vegetarian (my mom is a strict vegetarian), but when the tofu came out, I tasted it and there were tuna flakes on top! I asked one waitress to confirm what the flakes were and she looked at it and walked off to get another waitress. We were then told that the flakes were indeed fish and that the sauce is shrimp sauce. I was appalled..DON'T INDICATE THAT AN ITEM IS VEGETARIAN IF IT'S NOT VEGETARIAN. We then ordered grilled eggplant which was indicated to be vegetarian on the menu and once again, it had tuna flakes in it. All in all, it was really expensive (~$91 for 3 people) for a subpar AYCE sushi place with misleading menu items and okay customer service. The floor felt really greasy and slippery - I was literally sliding my way out. The only thing good about this place was the grilled beef rib which was flavourful and tender. Definitely will not be coming back and would not recommend this place. There are better AYCE sushi places."}
{"text":"Since I love sushi, especially AYCE, my friend brought me here for lunch. Instantly, I noticed the ambiance. It's a really nice place compared to other sushi restaurants I've been to. Too bad the food sucks. Honesty. The sushi was really bad and it was missing something - I don't know what. There was no taste! The good thing, besides the ambiance, was the lunch hours. It goes until 4:30pm, which not many sushi places do.   Ok so, the real reason why it's a one star for me was because that same night I was rushed to the hospital with food poisoning. I don't know what specifically caused it, but I know for a fact (from a doctors perspective) that it was from the sushi. i've had sushi at SO many places and I've never had anything like this before. It left me sick for 3 days and it was just a horrible experience.  I will never go there again. :("}
{"text":"Went here for lunch a few days after they opened. I used to go to the Leslie and Finch location, but that place is overcrowded and lacks parking. So I figured i would try this new location. The decor is great, very open and modern. Also we were the only customers at the time, so the service was fast... really fast. The waitresses were great, and talkative, which usually don't see at such places. They have a quite a large selection of foods to choose from, and everything is really good. Would def visit this place again."}
{"text":"This has got to be my favourite AYCE sushi place, and I'm sure I'm not the only one since there is usually a wait period to be seated (15-20 minutes seems to be the norm.) Not the cheapest place around, but definitely get a lot for what you pay. Other than a few \"house\" rolls and sashimi, the menu isn't that restricted for lunch. The service is usually fast and courteous, never had any issues. Unlike other places, they never seem to \"forget\" any orders. This has become my new local sushi place."}
{"text":"I come here quite a bit and it never disappoints.  Def one of my fav AYCE japanese restaurants.  This place is always busy so make sure you either come early or get a reservation.  Everything is fresh and they don't put a disproportionate amount of rice in their rolls/sushi to try to fill you up on carbs.  FAST and great service.  Some things i get every single time - green dragon roll (fav), beef ribs (greasy and fatty but SO good), tempura (the batter is not too heavy and is just right), grilled squid, beef/pork enoki rolls(these are amazing), grilled eggplant (if you love eggplant you will love this), teppanyaki veggies (it's basically cooked in butter)  A must try if you're into AYCE"}
{"text":"This will probably my go to all you can eat sushi restaurant in North York.   The staff is fast and attentive, and I was seated quickly. I went on a Thursday afternoon and it wasn't too busy.   Ordering is done in an iPad, and the staff can validate your order without coming to your table. The food was prepared quickly, and the quality is on par with other AYCE sushi restaurants. The lunch menu does not include a sashimi option, but that is to be expected.   We were there for over an hour, and the staff did not rush us to make room for more guests, as can happen at AYCE restaurants.   This was a good experience, and I would recommend it if you're looking for AYCE sushi!"}
{"text":"Fresh fish and delicate sushi at an AYCE? Fast and efficient service and pleasant servers.  Maybe not a \"five star\" restaurant but for a reasonable priced joint, 5 out of 5 stars.    Clients are mostly tables of 20 something's with a few families in the mix. It's a stat holiday today (Good Friday) and the place was packed with a lot of people waiting. Arrived at noon and was told a 1/2 hour wait for our table of 5. That was just about right.   The food arrived promptly in random order. The salmon was thinly sliced and deliciously fresh. The kalbi ribs were perfectly done - tasty but not dripping in sauce. Lots of options for non-sushi types. Individual portions of noodles, soups and chicken teriyaki.   Definitely will return."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place of all. I can easily say I come here at least once a week or two, because the quality of their sashimi blows me away. They have dressed sashimi, where the salmon or the beef is dressed in a yuzu sauce. It adds more acidity to the Salmon and creates a great flavour and aftertaste. They are constantly busy, so I do recommending reserving a table before coming. The prices are really worth it, if you go there enough sometimes the manager will give you a 10% discount. It's great for birthday dinners, because even if you don't eat sushi there's another large selection of dishes that you can choose from."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner last night with high hopes that a new worthy competitor had risen in the ayce sushi market. I was deeply disappointed by the overall experience.  Food: mediocre and lacking ACTUAL variety. The so-called \"special dinner only menu\" consisted of dishes that despite were \"interesting\", in reality just tasted odd. For example, the special salmon sashimi was this strange hybrid between smoked salmon and salmon sashimi. It was quite off putting. They also 'seemingly' offer a large selection of maki rolls but don't be deceived because they're all basically the same thing - with cucumber being the main ingredient.  The cooked food was just alright as the meats weren't exceptionally tender but not too tough to chew either. Interestingly for desserts, they offered herbal turtle jelly which tasted alright and was something new. However, their ice cream had freezer burn and overall, they offered a much smaller selection of desserts than most other places. The tea, not being green tea in the first place, was bland and served in a metal mug that lacked any Japanese authenticity.  Environment: 100% unacceptable. The tables were basically wooden planks concealed with Chinese restaurant white table cloths followed by a layer of brown construction paper?!? Completely inappropriate. They literally used the same brown paper we use at camp to prevent kids from drawing on the tables with crayons... Very unclassy.  That being said, the only redeeming factor of this restaurant was the outstanding service of ONE of the waitresses. Though I never caught her name, she truly deserves this shout out because of her impeccable attitude and work ethics. She was quick with clearing our empty dishes, hardworking when my dad messed up and spilled his cup of coke, and had a smile on her face throughout the entire night."}
{"text":"First time here on the recommendation of a friend, and really enjoyed it!! Came on a Saturday night just past 8pm, and waited around 15 minutes for a table for three.   I love sushi, and have been to quite a number of AYCE sushi restaurants. So when I try out a new AYCE place, I judge it based on the quality of the sashimi, and the variety of sashimi and sushi. The quality of the sashimi at Sushi Legend was pretty standard for an AYCE restaurant. In terms of the variety, on top of the usual sashimi/sushi items that every AYCE restaurant has, Sushi Legend offers scallop sashimi, spicy scallop sushi and squid sushi. However, what I thought really stood out about Sushi Legend is that they offer seared and pressed sushi, which I thought was really yummy! For those of you who like dessert, Sushi Legend offers quite a few selections!  Service was very fast. Once we placed our order, the food started coming within 5 minutes.  With our first round of orders, they only missed two of the items we ordered, which were brought out when we ordered it again in second round.  I would definitely recommend this place! And it has been added to one of the AYCE sushi restaurants that I will return to!"}
{"text":"I came met my family here for a Chinese New Year lunch and noticed that they were already eating. I sat down and immediately munched down on some awesome chicken katsu. So crispy and tasty, even though it had been sitting awhile (my family was uncharacteristically early for lunch and decided to start without me).  Other items I enjoyed:  - Grilled beef rib: sweet and grill-y tasting. Fatty in all the right places and just GOOD. - Enoki pork roll - a fantastic combo of tasty pork and the satisfying bite of enoki mushrooms - squid sushi - possibly the best sashimi squid I've ever had. Mild taste and not chewy at all - Chicken wing skewer - biased, I love chicken wings  The sushi was fine, but nothing really jumped out at me. What I really enjoyed were the grilled items.  I also love how quick the service was, from picking up the order to delivering it, despite the fact that the place was packed. The place runs like a well oiled machine and everything that was supposed to be hot, was HOT.  I can't wait to go back. The only big issue I had with the place is that the parking in that plaza just sucks."}
{"text":"Seats were worn out. Other than that, food was not too bad. It gets really busy specially on weekends and holidays."}
{"text":"I've been to Sushi Legend for several times, at least five. It is always a good place to hang out with friends and family. A large number of options can satisfy everyone.  The sashimi menu is a must try!!!Scallop and beef sashimi can be rarely found in any other AYCE sushi restaurant and both of them taste awesome. Ane their marinated salmon(Yuzu) and white tuna(herbal) are also very unique with the interesting flavor.  Do not forget to order the shrimp tempura, which is crispy and crunchy with very thin bread crumb and less oil. Mixed Veggie tempura is also a good choice.  Recently they started to use ipad to place the order. It's time-saving. You can browse the pictures and choose the dishes on the Ipad. Quickly place the order by yourself at any time."}
{"text":"The chef and staff eat with the customers.. which is unheard of. The food was really bad, the sashimi was doused in a citrus sauce that tasted like licking an orange peel. The fish was really gag worthy and not fresh at all. Not recommended for authentic japanese food lovers."}
{"text":"This AYCE Sushi place is spot on.  The service is quick, fast, and efficient.  Plates are brought and cleared from your table in record speeds.  The servers also do not forget anything.  So with that in mind make sure you order only what you intend on eating. If you are like me, I usually end up ordering one or two of almost everything on the menu to get my moneys worth.  The price we paid was $15.95 for lunch during a stat holiday.  The reviews on Yelp were accurate and you definitely need to make sure you either make reservations or get there early to get a table.   Now on to the food.... I ordered everything from salmon rolls, spicy seafood udon, grilled chicken and beef, seaweed salad, and a variety of other items on their packed lunch menu.  All of the food was declicious!!!    Make sure you come here super hungry so you can order everything!"}
{"text":"One of the better sushi ayce places to go in north york. I think the quality of the fishes is pretty much linear along all the sushi ayce places, so kitchen food is big factor for me to go. This place definitely has better kitchen food compared to many other places."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi  place with wide variety of options. I enjoyed the food and the service! It's a little crowded so make sure you reserve your table if you're going there during dinner time. There is parking near the restaurant, I think that it's free cos the place is a shopping place that has a parking lot for customers. $28.99 plus tax if you guys like to try their AYCE option. Love their green tea  ice cream soooo much!!!"}
{"text":"The food there was good, I have no complains about food. But the service was horrible. The server spilled miso soup all over my friend's pant. Although she did apologize, and I don't blame her, the other male server came over and asked\" what do you want?\". I was like, what!!? This guy didn't even care if my friend got burn or anything, instead he took a very evasive attitude while dealing with the issue. He tried to make it look like not a big deal, and suggested my friend should dry his pant using the hand dryer in the washroom, which is ridiculous, how could anybody dry his pant using the freaking hand dryer. It made me angry just hear him saying that. We didn't want to make a scene, so we let it go, and continue our dinner there. At the end of the meal, we asked if there is any discount to compensate for the unfortunate event that happened to my friend, and they took 10% off the bill. 10% off!! They expect 15% tip for good service, and only took 10% off for mistakes on their part?. It's ok not to give any discount if they didn't thin it was their fault, but 10% off as a gesture of apology? I don't think so. Never go back to this place again."}
{"text":"I don't particularly enjoy all you can eat restaurant for the obvious reason. The quality of the food in buffets are often compromised. And this place isn't an exception with one difference and that is the price. If you're a fan of all you can eat places, try it here but don't hold your breath."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite AYCE sushi restaurant. The somewhat poor service (due mostly to a high customer-to-server ratio) is mostly overshadowed by the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Definitely a hoppin' place. Great decorations and spacious. You get to order the food off an iPad that gives both English and chinese plus pictures that are super helpful. Food arrived within minutes. All of it was really fresh, especially the beef tataki. And if the order happened to be taking awhile, we asked the waitress and she would bring it right out. Service is definitely fast, and we had no wait. We went on a weekday night around 6 pm. At around 8 pm, we saw there was quite a line though. Id say the only thing that doesn't give this quite a 5 star is that there aren't as many choices on the menu as id like, just what you'd typically expect from any sushi restaurant plus a few extra things. Other than that, a good ayce place that id come back to."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi all you can eat right now. Love the herbal beef and salmon! They have almost everything you want for an all you can eat sushi restaurant. Only problem is too many people there especially for the dinner time."}
{"text":"I came back again because my friend recently told me that Sushi Legend had implemented the iPad system - which was what I mentioned was lacking the last time I came here (during in Christmas season 2015). This time, I went during lunch time instead of dinner.  Located in the corner of the plaza inbetween the Xiao Long Bao and Dollarama, you can't miss out on the Dollarama sign!  With a big group of 9 people, we were seated at the big booths in a circle. It seemed cool at first but after awhile, it was quite inconvenient regarding with placement of food, tea and empty plates. Was difficult to reach all the food with one end to another. It did zone us out from the crowd and was more intimate.   iPad system was slightly more efficient than others I've seen. Most of the places I've been to, you'd still need to flag down a server to \"confirm\" your order. For Sushi Legend, no need!! Just make sure to check if you get the notification that it has been sent to the kitchen. Although the iPad system doesn't say how much of the item you've ordered previously, it just has a red box (with no number) on the top right of the item.   Service was better this time around. They cleaned up the empty plates efficiently, gave us more tea, and was quick to return when asked for more tissues.   The menu, however, shrank from the huge list they've provided before. They used to offer \"sirloin cubes\" which now isn't being offered. Maybe during dinner but I feel like \"sirloin cubes\" is a staple in an AYCE menu, regardless of timing.  Dessert section still wasn't impressive. The tiramisu was horribly tiny and tasted off. Ice cream flavours offered are vanilla, green tea, red bean and mango. Some of us enjoyed the coffee pudding and ordered a second serving but I never tried it for myself."}
{"text":"Good, quick and fairly priced. Be sure to get the beef ribs and volcano roll. There is ample room if you have a baby stroller or car seat."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch buffet today.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and tables are well spaced out.    We were given 2 sheets to fill out our orders on.  We placed our first order and I think every dish came.  The place wasn't very busy though, maybe only a third full.  The food is not bad for an AYCE buffet.  We liked everything.  Only bad dish was the breaded chicken cutlet, it was way overcooked, dry and too thin.   The service is really great here, all wait staff are smiling and say you're welcome(in both Chinese and Cantonese).  Truly remarkable to have trained such nice staff (shows that it can be done).    I would definitely return here, I have been to their other location, which is much further away for me.  Only bad point is that the desserts are lacking here but I only get a green tea ice cream, and they offer that here."}
{"text":"Literally one of the better all you can eat Japanese food in the GTA. Variety is good and the food is amazing!!! This is somewhere where I would have confidence recommending my friends to!!! :)"}
{"text":"It is my favorite AYCE sushi place in Toronto. Their sauced beef/salmon sashimi  is amazing."}
{"text":"5 stars = Woohoo! As good as it gets! I will change it to 4 stars as soon as I find a better AYCE sushi place.  Forget new year's resolution! I was craving sushi and let's face it you can't just have few pieces :-) I came for lunch so I can't review sashimi. Sushis and makis were delicious and this place was not stingy with the meat unlike some other places. I liked salmon roses the best (pic below) as they got more meat than rice, something rarely found in AYCE sushi places. Hand rolls were just amazing, sea weed erryday!! Portions of grills were so smalls you think they are free samples! which means I can sample the whole grill menu without stuffing up. I usually avoid ordering temporas but I still ordered scallops which were tasty. Sweets are served in shot glasses. Free drinks.  The place is crowded yet clean and spacey. Comfy booths. Parking was a headache but it was worth it. Service is very friendly and efficient. Price is comparable to other AYCE sushi locations. Best so far. If you haven't tried this place out then ur simply missing out."}
{"text":"So I decided to try their AYCE weeknight dinner, and like all AYCE buffers, the weeknight dinner menu is slightly adjusted from the weekend one.  With that said, most of the items were still evident; however, one of the things I noticed was their grilled beef short rib.  While they still had it on their weeknight menu, the difference in quality of this item is massive; and to say the least, we were not impressed at all and did not order it again.  So the service: we got there pretty early for the dinner (about 4:45 pm), and to my surprise, there were quite a few tables occupied, but still quiet (which was a bonus!).  To compare the quality of service from the staff on the weekend (during one of its busiest times) to yesterday, again, lacking.  With so few tables to manage, the items should have been delivered at the same rate/faster (which it wasn't), the staff should have been more friendly (they were not; with the exception of one), and they really should not have messed up the orders/missed items.  Would I go again for a weeknight dinner? Probably not -- I'll wait until the weekend and pay a few more bucks."}
{"text":"Over priced for the quality they serve. Maybe cuz there's nothing good around this area people come here. Nothing is authentic. Their teriyaki sauce is so weird tasting. Their rice is over vinegar'd. My tongue is still stinging after drinking a whole glass of coke. Thumbs down!"}
{"text":"More like a 3.8. Pretty decent ayce sushi. Definitely the best in the area, in my opinion. This place has an ipad ordering system, so no awkward communication with waiters.  I came on a Saturday evening with a large group of 12. We were seated at the very front of the restaurant at a very large and awkwardly wide table. The table made it very difficult to reach the food, and this is where I had the most complaints for the night. Awkward table aside, the interior is very clean and modern. Plenty of seating, and even a sort of hidden area in the back which has even more seating if the place becomes packed.   For how busy the night was, our service was surprisingly fast. Our food was also very good for the most part. The salmon sashimi came in large, thick slices (I was fairly amazed as most ayce places came no where close to this). They even had scallop sashimi! The rolls however, were very small.  Another small criticism I have is that the tiramisu dessert was pretty disappointing, but their creme brulee made up for that. Keep in mind though, this place is a bit pricier than other ayce places, but I personally find that the quality justifies the price. Would come again if my friends and I wanted some ayce."}
{"text":"I visited in the first weekend of its opening and it did not disappoint. Lots of parking compared to the first location at Ravel and Finch in North York. Very spacious restaurant with more space in the back to be renovated. This Sushi Legend in Scarborough has maintained the quality and service of the North York restaurant. I recommend the sashimi which is nice and fresh, sushi and maki, the barbecue, and the udon and ramen."}
{"text":"Please understand that 3 stars means that this is above average. As far as AYCE Sushi places go, this is a very decent restaurant and easy to recommend. Their cheese wonton is surprisingly tasty and offers a great balance of flavors. Their beef roll is very well executed. The staff is nice, the food arrives quickly and the price is reasonable. If you are in the neighborhood and craving for sushis, you can't go wrong.  However, this won't be my new go-to place for AYCE sushi. The menu is much more limited than other places like 168 Asian Buffet and the salmon sushi could use a little more seasoning. Overall, I've found slightly better sushis in other AYCE like 168 Asian Buffet or Hockey Sushi. The room is also a small and I felt too cramped. They don't have much space to work with, but tables are very close from one another. The music is also loud. A bit too loud for me to start noticing it. I was not disappointed to have tried it out and I can understand why the people in the neighborhood love it. It just won't be on my list of favorites."}
{"text":"Love this place. The décor is beautiful.  They have an AYCE iPad service which is great (p.s. they clean the iPad screen so you're not touching everyone's DNA YAyy). Love all their rolls. Lunch and Dinner AYCE is awesome."}
{"text":"me and my sis accidentally found this spot when looking for a dollarama. so anyway, it's tucked away in some asian mini mall called chartwell. the restaurant sits between some dim sum spot and dollarama.   so yeah, my family went on a weekend and dinner for this, so those complaining about it getting busy, here's a \"protip\" as the kids say these days, when going to any asian/chinese spot for dinner, go around 5:30pm to beat the rush. this was true for sushi legend. there were folks there already but the booths were still open. also make reservations to guarantee a spot too.   onward to the food, i can't really tell you names of what is what but the food was decent for an all you can eat sushi spot in the GTA. for me personally, i find they all have equal or varying tastes and quality no matter where i go unless it's some buffet like dragon legend or mandarin and then the quality gets from mediocre to bad. the dishes i was feeling a lot were the cheese wontons and their version of fried rice. one thing i liked about the place, your orders came in hella fast compared to any other all you can eat sushi spot i've been to, at least in canada. the other thing i liked was the portions were moderate sized, so you didn't get too full fast or end up with too much food you wouldn't eat. so if you're a gluttonous landwhale, you might not like it there but then again, the orders came out so fast that you could just keep hitting up the order tablet for more and be fed to your desired fulfillment.  the server who sat us did take awhile to start up the ordering tablet but once she got it going, things went smooth. also, only one of my meals never came but it was way later into the dinner and i really was too full to eat anymore so it worked out.  before i end this, the place looked clean and nicely designed. it seems perfect for large gatherings for family or friends. i highly recommend this place and will be go to spot for all you can eat sushi within the scarborough area at least.   PS the cheese wontons were hella good if you didn't see me mention it already."}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE places in toronto for sure. Their fish is fresh, they are always busy - yet service is quick, and the have a great menu selection.  I usually stick to my favourite rolls and sashimi when I go to AYCE sushi, so what really sticks out to me is the quality of sashimi and their dessert menu.  The have such a good selection of dessert I want to come here just for the taro sago ."}
{"text":"When this place first opened up, lunch prices started at $12.99 per person. I could say I've dined at this place over 20+ numerous occasions. The only place I think AYCE sushi is worth its value is this place.  Service is amazing and the servers definitely work hard to clear your table as soon as your finished with a plate. The food quality is out of this world.  Although the food delivery to the table may take its time, it's because it's made to order. And anyways, the food comes out at shots and not one plate at a time. The only sad part is you can definitely notice the slow price increase every so often. It is now approx $22.99 for lunch as this place gains popularity. During holidays though, be aware of the price surge. In terms of the experience of the place it is so easy to mark down what you would like and how many portions. My family is hearing impaired and to verbally tell your server what you would like makes life a bit harder. However filling out a sheet makes it easier on us to visibly see what we are ordering. 4 stars definitely well deserved."}
{"text":"You only pay $15 (weekday lunch) to get all sorts of great sushi, entrees, etc. The atmosphere is great for a all-you-can-eat restaurant and most of all, the foods are delicious. I can tell that they have put in a great effort in making food. My experiences from several all-you-can-eat restaurant weren't the best, but this one was amazing."}
{"text":"THERES FLIES EVERYWHERE. It's honestly disgusting. I have chopsticks in one hand and my other hand is busy swatting the flies!!!! I always eat here, it's my sushi spot. But the last two times I've been there's been flies!!!! I thought maybe it was that one time or where we sat but the last time I ate here the flies were there again!!   I love sushi legend , the food is actually good it's just there's flies literally everywhere!!!!!!! And it sucks bc now my bf doesn't wanna eat here and we have to find a new sushi spot :("}
{"text":"There are so many ayce places around sometimes it's hard to choose which one to try. Sushi legend is one of the higher end ayce sushi places that serves torched and pressed sushi, so the price is more expensive. The question now is: is the food worth the price?  I've been here twice. The first time I came the sashimi was nice and cold, which is a big deal when eating ayce. The second time, the sashimi wasn't as good. Similarly, the first time provided better aburi sushi, but the second time around their pressed sushi had way too much mayo and simply covered the flavours of the dish.   That being said, their hot dishes were decent both times I went. Their short ribs were nicely marinated and very tender. Their grilled squid wasn't chewy at all. The tempura batter was decent, quite light. Their imitation shark fin soup was good and their steamed egg was soft. I would say they definitely use msg but it's also all you can drink pop so go order as many drinks as you want!   Overall, food was ok, but I won't come here on a regular basis because the price is quite expensive. Maybe for special occasions."}
{"text":"These service is good the atmosphere is nice. But when it comes to sushi and other food the quality is cheap. I'm here for lunch and it's AYCE restaurant. The fish on the sushi is so small and thin. very disappointing."}
{"text":"Decent food nothing special...order through iPad all you can eat sushi.  The service isn't there....don't ask for anything as they won't do anything.  Took about 15-20 mins for our food to come.  So make sure you order ahead."}
{"text":"This is a new location for Sushi legend, as they have several Chain stores. The standard for sushi legend has always been okay, and is not bad.  This store was once again pretty decent, although not spectacular. I went to this location for a lunch during a weekday, and they are really a decent sushi place.   The sushi is not the best for an AYCE, and the rice to fish portions are not amazing, in fact they could use a lot less rice, however their maki rolls are not bad and the fish quality is decent. The cooked food was definitely a lot better. the tempura was done well, the short ribs are pretty good, and the chicken was decent.  the decor is spacious and beautiful and great for parties.   The service was decent, and it is old school as it is still pen and paper for the most parts. i think overall the consensus is the restaurant is average, and is decent but not good or great.   if you want to grab ayce sushi and in that area there aren't a lot to choose from. this is an okay choice, but if you are able to drive to other areas. there are definitely better options out there."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a thursday night. i have to say that it is definitely not on the top of my list of places to go for AYCE sushi, or even a la carte sushi in general. The price they charge is a little higher than your regular sushi ayce. however the food is average. it is not amazing, it is not terrible, it is average. Overall i can't find myself describing it as a place to specifically recommend friends to go. The selection is okay, but the maki rolls need work as they are not very good. The sashimi is average, the slices are little too thin in terms of the salmon. I know it is ayce but a slice of sashimi that is too thin, basically meanst hat the sashimi will not have the texture feel that makes it good. Overall i find that this is a sushi place that takes longer then average to get food out, The service was okay, it was not bad, or great. and as you can see from the theme of this review, its that everything is average. its hard to give it less or more then 3 stars as nothing really popped out to surprise or amaze me.   I would recommend if you are in the area, and crave an ayce sushi place, then this place is servicable. however i would not go out of my way to try it."}
{"text":"First time here and I like it. Service is quick for AYCE restaurant. The food is consider good also. Very rare I give a 4 star . It's worth a try if you never been here."}
{"text":"Service is fast & friendly and the quality of sushi is amazing. My favourite ayce sushi place."}
{"text":"AYCE Doesn't get any better than this. Why?  1, Quality - The food here is fresh, colorful and tasty.   2, Consistency - Taste, service and time. The food almost tastes the same every time I go. The servers are very nice by comparison to most AYCE restaurants. And even on the busiest days they still manage to serve your food in a reasonable amount of time.  3, Decor - It's a relatively new restaurant and everything still looks brand new  4, Location -  It's very close to me plus free parking right in front of the store, if not around the plaza  5, Price- It's not the cheapest place you can go to but it's worth every penny. Plus soft drinks are included in the price.  Even though I had just stopped by 2 days ago. I'll be seeing you soon sushi legend"}
{"text":"The legend continues.  I ate and ate and ate some more.  There were rolls.  There was tempura.  The pop was bottomless. I had 2 glasses of iced tea. My friend had two glasses of ginger ale. We were also served tea. We ordered sunny roll, volcano roll, and rainbow roll. We were all stuffed. I especially like their mango yoghurt and mango pudding and green tea ice cream. Their other ice cream flavours are mango, red bean, and vanilla. We met the manager name Roy today. He is really nice. We will come back here again."}
{"text":"I went here for all-you-can-eat lunch with my younger sister. Our overall experience was horrible. The servers were constantly talking amongst themselves and barely visited our booth to ask how everything was going. The food was nothing special and was inconsistent with taste. When it came around to asking for the bill there were no servers in sight. I continuously pushed the service and bill option on the iPad but no one ever came by. Finally after 25-30 minutes a server walked by and I was able to flag her down to ask for the bill. Since the restaurant was pretty much empty at this time I was truly disappointed and frustrated with lack of service I recieved. I don't see myself visiting this location in the near future."}
{"text":"Came here for AYCE lunch on a whim and checked in on yelp to get a small Shirley temple mocktail, which was orange juice with some syrup at the bottom. Very spacious restaurant and quick service even on a holiday. There was iPad ordering and everything we ordered came without error, but the roles were pretty standard. The salmon put on roles/sushi was very thin. I really enjoyed the chicken wings, which were small, tasty and on a stick. I also liked the lychee yogurt and coffee pudding, which were in small cups like Matsuda, but have a creamier consistency."}
{"text":"I rarely visit ayce Japanese restaurants, but came here with my parents and their friends.   They have a big selection of cooked foods.   I came during dinner, so I got to try the sashimi. The scallop sashimi is really yummy and not many ayce serve them. The beef tataki is served in a ponzu sauce and really good!!   There is also the salmon in yuzu sauce that makes it very citrus-y and refreshing. The roll and sushi come with small amounts of rice, so you won't be too filled up on carbs and you're able to try more foods.   My mackerel sashimi never came, but I didn't bother ordering it again since I was getting full trying all the other foods available.   I tried a couple of rolls and wasn't too impressed.  I had crazy roll and spider, it was just okay.  The sushi and sashimi are much better.   The tempura are very crunchy and fresh, beef enoki roll and pork enoki rolls are fresh and juicy.  Diced garlic with sirloin steak is not over cooked.   The service is pretty good, and really fast.  Food just keeps coming and we were trying hard to clear the plates fast enough to accommodate new ones.   The menu comes with free drinks, but don't fill up too much in carbonated drinks.   Lastly, the desserts!! Huge selection, not just your ice cream.  There was herbal jelly, creme brulee, mango pudding, mango yogurt, lychee yogurt, fried banana.  The mango yogurt shots are so good!!! Something I look forward to whenever we have ayce!   The price is pretty decent.  26.95 for weekend dinner, 24.95 for weekday (no scallop sashimi). They have children prices and senior pricing.   The restaurant is bright and big. Nicely lit up, and in the new mall next to bestco."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday with a bunch of friends. It was actually pretty good compared to many AYCE places I've been too. We ordered a lot of scallop and sweet shrimp sashimi! The hot food was alrighr too. We tried a lot of their rolls as well. Not much to complain about other than the wait for the table despite calling in for a reservation pretty early."}
{"text":"Been here a few times  The place is small so it's recommended that you get a reserve  Sushi is quite tasty  Loved the enoki rolls.....  I think me and my buddy dusted three orders of those in no time  The service is so so  Sometimes they are good and helpful  Sometimes they forget orders or don't tend to yourself as quickly as some other places  I find they try to rush you given their size of the restaurant and getting other patrons in  Hopefully they can expand cause they can get lots more patrons in!!!!"}
{"text":"The yuzu salmon sashimi and beef tataki sashimi dishes are the standout dishes that Sushi Legend has chosen to set them apart in the competitive world of AYCE japanese in Toronto.  They claim to have over 168 items on their AYCE menu and a lot of it is similar to what you can find at most comparable AYCE restaurants.  The sashimi slices are nice and thick while the standard hot items like steak teriyaki, salmon teriyaki, and grilled beef ribs are done nicely.  I was pleasantly surprized that they offered grilled chicken heart skewers and sizzling flounder on the menu and gladly ordered a few rounds to indulge.    All-in-all, I enjoyed my experience at Sushi Legend and the service staff were efficient and attentive."}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty spacious and has comfortable seating but the food is awful. The sashimi isn't fresh at all, the sauce they use is weird. Nothing taste particularly good, overall bad quality ingredients and no cooking skills.  I bit into piece of metal, and told the waitress, she just said its from the kitchen cleaning tools like it's totally normal.   The floor in front of the sushi bar is very slippery.   Overall bad food and below average customer service. Not coming back again."}
{"text":"The interior looks not too bad. I was so excited to try it. But when the hot dish like teriyaki beef, salmon or others. I feel it's really salty and oily. After had dinner there I have to drink a lot of water. And I do not like they put to much mayo inside the sushi. I know it tastes really good but for health concern probably it's not a smart idea. BUT their YuZu salmon is so good, I ordered like 20 pieces each time. However it's too thin, I wish they can cut it thicker it will taste even better. For the desert, the mango yogurt is really good too. But just too small, they put it in the shot glass, hope they can put in a bigger container next time.   I just hope they do not add so much salt and oil to the dish in the future. That's why I am only willing to give them three stars."}
{"text":"Quality of the food was quite good.  Good selection of food.  Price for young kids a bit steep though.  I like how soft drinks are included and there is a variety of desserts to select from and they are in small portions.  Portions for the serving sizes were reasonable.  Would go back again."}
{"text":"This is our first time to Sushi Legend. When we got here around 6:30pm (made reservations) on a long weekend it wasn't packed. We got our seats immediately.   Ordering food on a tablet was easy. Like that the sashimi pieces were in order of increments of 1 piece.   The sashimi was very good. The beef tataki and beef short ribs were yummy.  Love the okras and mushrooms- were cooked with butter and garlic.   The beef roll wrapped in green onion was dry and seemed over cooked.   Soft drinks were included. The usual soft drink choices.   The only thing we didn't like were the sushi rolls. They were on the bland side."}
{"text":"I usually go to the other branch at Leslie plaza, which is very close to home. This one is new and much more spacious and there are dollarama and bestco, so very convenient to go for grocery and small shopping afterward. Also, I like the decor esp. The lighting, and their service is much better. They don't cut my orders as much as the other branch. Like tonight, they missed several pieces in the first round, but I ordered the missing pieces the second round,they serviced every order I made.  Husband is allergic to shrimp, shell, and crab. (Not deadly though) And I don't like deep fried stuff. So we have our \"regular orders\" everywhere we go: We both like Yuzu salmon, herb tuna, beef tataki, and sashimi with some sushi rice to go with (or we feel it's too oily/ heavy), so Salmon rose, spicy scallop sushi (just for me), and crazy dragon rolls are also musts. Then we randomly selected some pieces (not all) of enoki beef, curry pork skewers, short ribs, teriyaki salmon, chicken wings & hearts, flounder, shrimps(for me), and deserts. It's getting warmer and we constantly crave for sushi.  I'll come back more often if they have torched sushi like some other ayce restaurants."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on Thursday night, dishes on the dinner menu is very nice too. I think we will go there more often in summer.  Only thing bothered me a little is that they often cut our orders. Such as i ordered 16 salmon flowers they only served 8 with little to no rice in the flower; ordered 4 pieces of flounder they brought us 2; I ordered 2 pieces of salmon teriyaki, bbq cream mushrooms, they never served us; I ordered 5 rolls they brought us 4.  We can order again but it did bother us a little."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for a loooong time, ever since I've seen the grand opening signs. I tried coming here last week on Saturday for Lunch, but it was closed for the official grand opening...and everything was bombarded with flowers! It was crazy!  Anyways, we called today to make sure, and they were open.  We went in, and because we were a group of 5, we had to wait about 10 minutes for the tables to clear. I guess this place is pretty busy with all the people who come to the finch/leslie plaza. It was full of asians, so you know its going to be good!  We ordered a lot, and to save yelp from knowing what kinda gluttons me and my friends are, I'll just point out the highlights and lowlights!   MUST GET:  1. Curry Pork Skewer - AMAZING. Perfectly cooked, with lots of flavour that just bangs in your mouth yo.  2. Beef / Green Onion roll (called something else on the menu) SO FANTASTIC. Best I've had ever.  3. DESERTS. They have so many varieties! The custard cream was so light and refreshing. The mango sago was really yummy too! They also had banana tempura, jello, herbal essence jello (didn't try it) and the usual ice creams.  4. THE ROLLS - standouts were the green dragon, volcano and spicy crab. SUPER GOOD. THey weren't huge or overstuffed with rice, which made it mad easy to eat.   5. DRINKS. They're included in the price! I actually prefer fountain to canned, and it was awesome and perfect!   6. ROCK SHRIMPS - HUGE ASS SHRAMPS COVERED IN AMAZING WHITE STUFF. What more can I say yo.  Misses   1. The Seafood Pad Thai was inedible. So sweet and nasty. Overcooked seafood thrown in, it was like eating rubber.  2. Tears are streaming down my face right now, but the galbi was so sad. It was just pure fat, and it was not delicious.  3. The Salmon Fried Rice was mediocre.    FInal Thoughts:  Check In for a 10% discount!  Grand Opening 10% discount right now (only 1 discount at a time)  Servers all spoke english and were really enthusiastic, but they did forget a few items (Really wanted to try the mushrooms with shrimp paste and the grilled eggplant)  WILL DEFO BE GOING BACK! SUPER CONVINIENT AND SUPER CHEAP AND SUPER AUTHENTIC (As compared to other places)"}
{"text":"Ahhh, what a find! This place was awesome! Highly recommended for an AYCE sushi.  I recently had a bad experience from a local favourite joint so I was looking for a replacement.  The food was great, the service was fast and the overall experience was enjoyable.  Food: 4/5, a lot of choices for general food but less on rolls. However, the rolls were small sized with good rice to content ratio so you can try without feeling like you don't want the rest.  the only negative I would say is that it seemed like they ran out of some things because we would order it again for it to not come to our table at all.  It would be good for them to remove things they are not going to serve.  Service: 4/5, good service as they use an iPad for ordering which makes AYCE experience so much better as you don't have to write things down or hail a waitress everytime.  Ambience: 4/5, great decor and awesome seating.  They really amped up the interior for an enjoyable dinner experience.  Price: 3/5, very typical around $30 per person for dinner"}
{"text":"Come on man!  Someone, please message me if sushi legend finds their groove again. It's decent right now but everytime I come I'm just sad that it's not living up to the standard it once set for itself. We went to sushi legend at least once a month before.   Sushi legend, you used to be my go-to. What happened? I'm getting  Kalbi where you forgot to add salt to the marinade. And sashimi is sometimes good in the first plate, bad in the second plate, or vice versa. I even tried the other location. The only difference is that the sashimi there is only good if you order in small amounts.   What is this??!?!   Unagi handroll is good at both locations in case you're going. Alot of food is pretty good still, actually.  BUT...  Sushi legend, you are becoming a legend of how good you once were. I have many friends who sympatize with me when I mention this. I miss what it once was. Can someone please direct me to the new legend of ayce sushi?  Also, p.s. my partner would like the custard cream dessert to come back. If you bring that back, I'm sure I won't have a choice but come back...lol (he loves his custard cream).  Btw. Tried sushi at Ayoyama. They know what they're doing. So good :p  Sushi legend, get ur ducks in a row! Please!! Before I replace you. My partner: you've already been replaced.  Kyoto house dinner ayce is really good. The Kalbi there is on point along with its sushi. The rice to fish ratio is on point."}
{"text":"I had a great opinion about the AYCE, but the last time I went, it was not as good. The chicken teriyaki was horrible, with just one try made me feel sick the whole evening. Seems the quality is downgrading. It's a shame."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday lunch with my family, this location was recently open - Grand Opening 10% off. This location is spacious than the one in North York. The menu is the exactly the same as the North York location. I was impressed with the service, once we walk in the door... a friendly waitress comes up and greet us to the seat, and we don't have to wait long for the food. I like the selections as well, we ordered a lot of the raw sushi roll, however my parents ONLY like cooked food... and they have lots of varieties. The lunch price is very reasonable - $15.99 adult and we could sit comfortably and chit chat."}
{"text":"Food is very good but the service was spotty. The quality of the sushi is top notch for all you can eat. Probably the best quality in the area. Spare ribs are very good too. It is much pricier than any ayce sushi ive been. Lunch ends 4:30pm and is 15.95 mon-thurs, 16.95 fri-sun.  I went on a sunday for lunch and didnt have to wait much for a seat. Although not super busy it took forever to get our food meanwhile every other table that came after us got their orders. Others were getting the same things that we ordered before us. At one point we sat around for 15 minutes with an empty table, having to call to 4 staff members that we were still missing 6 dishes. Other tables seemed to be getting decent service though so this is more a personal experience. One positive thing is that they didnt cut our orders, we got exactly the amount asked for."}
{"text":"Love this place for All You Can Eat Sushi!! It's a great place with a good variety on the menu. We went here for lunch on a weekend. It's best to go before 12:30 as it gets packed really quickly. Loved all the different kinds of rolls especially the Sexy Summer Roll and Dynamite Roll. I usually order the beef or seafood ramen as well. Loved the Eel Fried Rice even though there's not much eel meat in the rice. I would get the Rock Shrimp and Beef Enoki Rolls as those are my personal favorites from this place!! There are a variety of desserts too and soft drinks are included. Staff are efficient and friendly most of the time!! Overall, great dining price and would definitely be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I can here with my family for Victoria Day. It wasn't too busy and the food taste good. Unfortunately they mixed up our orders, and forgot orders. We had to tell them they forgot our orders and then we were given the wrong orders still. So the experience wasn't totally awesome in that sense. But overall the food is good."}
{"text":"It's been quite a while since we've been to this ayce restaurant. Last time we visited in 2016 they had let things slide.  I'm happy to say they've upped their game from our last visit.  Now with iPad ordering!  We came for dinner service and ordered an assortment of sashimi, nigiri, maki, grilled items, torched sushi, and soups. Everything was tasty and nicely plated. Proportions of protein to rice was good, sushi rice perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned (hooray!), sashimi fresh.  Despite being busy the kitchen seemed well organized.  Wait time for our food from ordering to table was very quick - literally minutes. Service was helpful and excellent.  All in all an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Moderately priced AYCE.  Have been coming for years and it's still fantastic.  Service is quick and accommodating. Be sure to make a reservation at dinner as it is very popular."}
{"text":"The restaurant is quite large and spacious.  Very comfortable seating.  Overall, the food was average.  Typical AYCE. The only downside, they don't have grilled salmon belly and the desserts was sub-par.  The desserts are better at Kaka and Yamamoto."}
{"text":"Sushi Legend, an all you can eat Japanese Restaurant located at Finch and Leslie at a VERY busy plaza.  Once you get over the parking lot and manage to find a spot, this AYCE Japanese Restaurant does not disappoint.  The environment is your typical Chinese-run AYCE, tables are close to each other and relatively small dinning area.    Food wise, this place is pretty decent, the Scallop Sashimi and the Squid (Ika) Sushi are indeed the highlight of this restaurant!  Not a lot of AYCE Japanese restaurant allows all you can eat scallops sashimi and squid sushi due to the cost of them.  I am glad they offer it and they are both very fresh!  They do have a great variety of sushi, sashimi and hot food and based on the items I ordered in my three visits, they are all very decent.  The items I would highly recommend as a MUST try are: Scallop Sashimi, Squid (Ika) Sushi and Beef Tataki.  4 stars because of a 1 star deduction in the area as it is hard to find parking at peak hours and the dinning area is very tight."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Small portions. Very slow at bringing food out. Getting confused with our orders. Not worth your money!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff :) food comes quickly. Some orders were forgotten but delicious sashimi and grilled dishes. The dinner items are worth the extra money!"}
{"text":"Selected this restaurant from listing on Yelp! and was not disappointed. Atmosphere was pleasant when we walked in; nice decor and not overly noisy. Service was quick and courteous. Food was fresh and tasty with a very pleasant presentation. I would definitely recommend coming here for a nice sushi dinner. An all you can eat meal with the quality comparable to what you would expect with an a la carte menu."}
{"text":"I was living super close by when it first opened and I remember when AYCE was $14 at lunch... Now it's $17 (at least, as of today).  Variety is great; service is better than most sushi places, at least for AYCE (like they don't forget items that you've ordered and the staff are reasonably friendly); I just wish it was cheaper... I'm going to try their lunch menu soon - it looks pretty good and fairly priced."}
{"text":"Overall the food was great. Sake mussels were a favourite of mine and of course the sashimi and surf clams were awesome. Sushi was good. Quality was nice.   Just a bit of a nag though was the service in the beginning. Waitresses/waiters don't even look at you to see if you need something or need to take a menu from you. Had to hold up my hand for five minutes and I actually had to get UP and walk towards a waitress. And she held it for another five minutes and I had to ask the manager to deal with it. All our waters were done 10 minutes in and never refilled again. A lot of hands are up asking for assistance but no acknowledgement..  I know it's a newer restaurant because outside there was flowers saying Welcome and Congrats!   Overall great place to eat. Lots of room. Beautiful place. Just gotta fix the service abit."}
{"text":"This place is has really good appetizers and side dishes but I'm not the biggest fan of the sushi. A couple of the sushi options they have are decent but some of them are a total mess like the sexy summer roll... gross. My favourite appetizers are the teriyaki, chicken cutlets, tempura, sushi pizza and sushi pizza on a corn chip which was surprisingly addictive.  PS don't order the ramen if you don't like having a fishy after taste. The seaweed is either a hit or a miss"}
{"text":"We came here on a friend's recommendation... it was only ok.  I feel like there are better places.  Nothing was outstanding, but nothing was gross.  I would say, it's fine if you feel like sushi and you're in the area.  I don't think it was super expensive, and it was rather busy in my opinion.  I would not go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"So full... Can't type. Eat all the desserts.  They are awesome.  Everything on the menu is great... although I would be careful with the grilled fish. Lots of bones.  Lots of work. Lots of favour.  Can't wait to lose more weight and head back."}
{"text":"The only place where they serve you actually all you can eat sushi and not stop serving you. The place is  always packed up so sushi and sashimi is always fresh."}
{"text":"We saw there were 127 reviews with 3.5 stars so we decided to come for a visit. It was a huge disappointment. The salmon is not fresh, has been defrost too long. the rice is hard. Hand roll: Seaweed is hard as well. the selection is very limited. I would not recommend this restaurant at all.   If you ever have opportunity, check out the KB between Mississauga Road and 401.  It's much better quality of AYCE restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Thursday ($15.95 without tax/tip; Fri-Sat: $16.95) and there was ample seating! This place is your super standard AYCE restaurant, if anything slightly above average. The decor was modern and mesmerizing, ceilings high, and premises clean.   Service: Easy to flag someone down, they didn't forget any food orders  Food: They had a whole list of items that were dinner only (including the creme brulee, sashimi, some special rolls) and I do wish they had a bit more variety, but for the price point the I could deal with it. Teriyaki (salmon, chicken, beef) and tempura were really good and sushi was average (wish they had more special rolls for lunch). Pop was included in the price.   Dessert was pretty good too! Selection larger than your basic ice cream and banana tempura but not as extensive as matsuda. YES to coffee pudding, mango yogurt, mango pudding, ice cream and banana tempura. NO to tiramisu and herbal essence jelly.   You know how at some ayce restaurants you order something like sushi pizza and the portion ends up being HUGE so you have to share with someone and you think to yourself \"how am I going to finish this!? I just wanted a bit of it.\" That won't happen here, so just order away!   3.5/5"}
{"text":"Great new AYCE place close to home!!!! Cozy, very fast and nice service, 22.95 for AYCE dinner on a weekday (Mon to Thur)  POP INCLUDED IN AYCE PRICE! love this part.  Came here with a friend on Monday night around 9:30, waited about 10 min for a table. The order menu is extensive, try a little bit of everything!!  Beef sashimi is to diiieeee for - soft and the sauce is great. Grilled squid was ordered twice FO SHO. Sashimi was super fresh and thick cut, just how i like it. Maki were AAAMAZING - so little rice and they themselves were so small, very happy about that cuz I could try a bunch of different ones :)  I recommend ordering the 4 piece special rolls under the dinner menu, they're all fancy and pretty and I guarantee you will not be disappointed!  Beef rolls with onions were AMAZING! So soft and the perfect ratio of onion to beef. Beef ribs were good too, not the best I ever had but definitely delish..  No complaints, other than it was a little hard to flag down service cuz we were in the back room and the seaweed salad was so tiny I ate it in one \"chopsticks\" full :("}
{"text":"Very intriguing atmosphere, great quality sushi . Ordering was super easy with your own ipad! Quite expensive compared to other sushi joints but you get what you pay for!  Only complaint was the bug on the table when we were all finished, not impressed."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. It had long hours which made it convenient and the sushi quality was delicious. I don't usually expect much from ayce but this place was a pleasant surprise. Was really busy but service was good. They were polite and made it a good birthday celebration for me"}
{"text":"I felt compelled to start reviewing good AYCE sushi places after my last two hangouts closed down.  I tried this place out based on a few recommendations from friends and family.  The place was busy, but we were quickly seated even though a few people in our group were still on their way (cool!).  The menu consists of a large placemat-sized paper where you mark off the quantity of the items you'd like to order.  Great selection of items (they have SCALLOP SASHIMI!!!), especially if you're there for the dinner menu (which is also available during lunch provided you're ready to fork over dinner pricing).  The sashimi and maki were fresh, and the kitchen items tasted great!  I thought the food was overall flavourful, appetizing, and had great variety.  I particularly liked the Marinated Sashimi (Scallop Sashimi was a good size), Saki Mussels, Pork Enoki Rolls, just to name a few.  Service was great, staff were readily available and items were served as ordered (I am sure it is the bane of everyone's AYCE experience when ordered items are MIA).  Dessert menu also featured a wide selection of both ice cream and other sweets (Creme Brulee is dinner only, but yum!).  With weekend pricing, dinner was $27+tax+tip, which is pricier than my last two places, but isn't the price of everything going up?  (especially in Canada these days...)  Hopefully this place will one day offer a loyalty or cash incentive because yes... I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Everything is sooooo fresh, so clean, so delicious. The foods presentation is excellent, the service is super quick and the space has a great atmosphere. Would highly recommend. I love sushi and I haven't been to a better place then this!"}
{"text":"I am delightfully surprised. This place was A+ in not only food, but actually service! Can you imagine? An AYCE sushi restaurant with not only great food, but attentive, friendly, and quick service. Besides Kaka, this will now be my go-to place for AYCE sushi.  Food: Go for the torched and pressed sushi. They do it very well here, similar enough to what you would get at a higher end restaurant (i.e. Kaka, torched sushi at JaBistro, etc). Everything else is done quite nicely, everything on the menu quite delicious.   Surprising for this AYCE place, the 40 salmon sashimi that you ordered, will actually come out! This is a miracle!   What really got me was our server Sarah. She spoke mandarin, very little Cantonese. But was very detail orientated, and before I lifted a plate to make room for others coming, she was already there to take it away from me. And also with a smile!   Overall, I am definitely looking forward to making another trip sometime soon. Thanks Sarah!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: located in a super crowded plaza, right next to congee Wong, place is nice and spacious, modern, clean. We came here for weekend lunch 14.99  Food: although no sashimi for lunch, they offered plenty. Their volcano roll was a crispy fried sushi roll with crabmeat and cucumber, super delicious! Lots of ramen and udon soups, as well as different types of skewers. All very well marinated. They also offer a good selection of desserts to choose from unlike some other sushi places.   Overall: I'll definitely be back! Service was quick! And overall a very satisfied meal!"}
{"text":"food is great servers are not. although our dishes were constantly brought out and picked up promptly the servers would throw dishes on to the table and even the bill as if they are giving food to dogs...  the food was delicious but too bad the waitresses had to ruin the experience"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I been to this place. Decided to come here for friend's birthday. Lunch price increased to $21 now. Good thing is now you can order from iPad and drinks are now included. It's a typical ayce sushi place. Food is average."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite AYCE sushi with a reasonable price. Service is good, food is fresh and now they have iPads to order, which is even better. I've here more than 3 times and world definitely vi-me again!"}
{"text":"Great sushi! Very fresh and tasty.  Gotta try the Yuzu."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 3-4 times, and it is a nice place to meet up.  They have a large variety of options and have the typical AYCE options. Their fish is very fresh and they don't put too much rice either."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here whenever we are feeling for AYCE sushi. It's probably one of the better AYCE places in Scarborough! Service is very prompt - food is quick too. Friendly and polite staff. Price is not too expensive, about the average price for AYCE. The interior is also pretty nice with it's unique light bulbs lol. The only downfall is that sometimes the food varies... I assume because of different chefs? But that's not a big concern as the food is still good.  Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great selection. Some of the fish wasn't as quality but still fine. The non-sushi options were great. My friend really liked the scallops, we both liked the mushrooms and the kalbi. The desserts are great too. Small sizes so you can get a bunch of them."}
{"text":"Best AYCE in Scarborough! Large variety but can be busy on weekend evenings, reservations recommended. Their torched sushi and octopus balls are a must try!"}
{"text":"Service is super fast. Presentation of food is good, but the taste is just okay. Not as good as others described.   Seen a lot of good review and a few bad ones, so I decided to try it myself.   Food Delivery of food is super fast (5 stars) Presentation of food (4 stars) Taste of food (3 stars, just average) Accuracy of food order (2 stars, Because of the speed of their service, couple times they got my order wrong in terms of the quantity of food, the choice of food)  Service (3 stars, quick and response fast but not very personal) - They serve the food too fast, you wonder how they did it. =) - They clean up plates on your table very fast as well, they are constantly looking for plate to take away. Couple times they take away my plates that are not finished. =( - They run it kind of like a task. What I mean is, they are here to just serve you food and clean your table and hand you the bill. They don't try to have any kind of personal interaction with you. Its plainly running a business. =(  Other observation. The place are opened by Mainland China people. Their customer base seems to be 80% Mainland China people as well (on the night I went). Not necessarily good or bad, just an observatoin. I think they are running it too business like, with no friendly interaction. Not that their service is bad, just hope to have more interaction and may be a little smiles. Also, not happy that they are serving Chinese tea instead of Japanese green tea.  For the price, I think its a little pricy. I prefer to places like Yellowtail than here, where they value the service and quality of food more. But if you live close to Leslie and Finch, then there are not too many choices around."}
{"text":"Quite decent and reasonably priced. I've been here twice for AYCE lunch. Occasionally forgets certain items I ordered even though it's clearly gone through on their iPad system. Food is not amazing, but still decent and worth the try. Would go back again."}
{"text":"i am a fan indeed.  pretty impressed with the service and the quality of the food.  you order with the ipad.  you get precise ordering this way.  the dessert came with a very tiny plastic throwaway spoon!  too small for my liking.  the dessert was good though.  the waiting staff were pretty good.  not stellar.  some dishes were put on the table as if they did a drive by.  the food was very fresh and came out at a steady rate.  tempura batter was light and crispy and fluffy.  the various flavours were pretty spot on.  oh yeah, the soya sauce looked to me as if they were diluted.   it was not that dark/black brown that real soya sauce looks like.  all in all i was pretty happy to eat here.  i would defo come back here."}
{"text":"I'm a bit surprised at all of the positive reviews for this place.  The food here was only okay. The salmon sashimi was a little fishy and they only offer scallop sashimi on the weekends (major reason why the group came here..). They should at least offer it every day but have you pay the difference.   The hot dishes weren't great either. The beef with garlic was laughable. The Kalbi was pretty tender though, but still, nothing wow. I was delighted to see they had mango yogurt on the menu, but it seems like the only place to do this right is Tenichi.   A positive for this place was the paper ordering system. I think it's more efficient than telling the waiter your order. Saves time for everyone.   I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Tenichi is the place to go for AYCE japanese."}
{"text":"Amazing all you can eat. Loved all their special rolls. The desserts were also great especially the coffee pudding."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better AYCE sushi places.  It is a little pricier but overall its worth it.   Food - 4/5: all the standard dishes such as sashimi, sushi, and specialty rolls were average, nothing special. Something to note is that a lot of their dishes, sushi and rolls are pretty small in size in comparison to other places. The salmon was also a bit lighter in colour than other sushi places, but in terms of taste it was pretty much the same. The sirloin steak cubes and spicy scallop sushi were particularly good. The sirloin steak cubes were tender and a bit sweet, and they hit the spot. The spicy scallop sushi was made with raw scallop, which you don't see often, and had a smokey and flavourful taste. Also, soft drinks are included in this place, which is a plus.  Service - 4/5: orders are made using an iPad and a waitress/waiter delivers them very quickly afterwards. This place also doesn't try to undercut you, like when you order 8pcs and you only get 6, which is nice.  Overall Sushi Legend is pretty good and definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Typical AYCE restaurant and service.   I was surprised how busy it was even though we went at 9pm (okay, give the fact it was a Friday night) but I didn't think people would be waiting to eat at a AYCE place at that hour. The place closes at 11.   The one food that really stood out to me was the grilled flounder and the scallop sashimi! We ordered so much of the sashimi - it was delicious!! Of course, this is only during the dinner menu so this is just a FYI.   I was surprised with the price. It came out to be around $30-35 (with tip) since it was a Friday night."}
{"text":"Quality has dropped and memu diversity has shrunk. Service is also shite and the prices have done nothin but increase. 2/5 hands down. Used to be one of my favourite sushi joints but man has it gone down the drain!"}
{"text":"Large selection of items offered on their AYCE menu. Fish is fresh and presented nicely. Their sushi is a little smaller than other places though but I'm not complaining. On my last visit, I noticed the new addition of aburi/torched sushi on their menu as well. Their cooked items are done well.   Food comes promptly and I don't feel they arbitrarily change your sashimi orders or \"lose\" your food orders. Service is decent and there's always one lady that whisks away the empty plates the moment you take the last piece of sushi.   Parking is a nightmare most of the time and there's always a line. Call ahead to reserve a table (but you'll still have to wait a little bit at the door). Well priced for the quality and service offered."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place several times and decided it was time to try it. I came here with a friend for lunch. Nice place. Very spacious, with high ceilings, nice lighting, and nice decor.  Ordering was done through an iPad. It was convenient, with pictures of each dish. Descriptions would have been a nice touch. The food started arriving shortly after.  The first couple of dishes, miso soup and salad, were quite salty but things got progressively better from there. In the end, we were happy with the food and were quite stuffed. It was all good, although nothing was outstanding. Good value.  Rating: 3.5"}
{"text":"I would have given it a 3 star but the service was horrible. You order on a huge sheet of paper with what you want, except they choose what they want to serve you. We ordered a total of 3 time, and every time without fail, at least half of the food didn't come. At the very end, we ordered a few ice creams and 2 sodas, and they even managed to leave out the sodas.  Other than that, the food was so so. I would have rather went to Tenichi or Ajisai (thornhill location)."}
{"text":"Came here with my family on a Tuesday night. When we first sat down, I ordered couple of items, and my mom ordered some more. Some of our food came on a timely manner, but 60% of what we ordered didn't come even after 40 minutes of waiting. I ordered few things after, and what I ordered came immediately so it's either they forgot our first order or thought we couldn't finish what we ordered because my parents are tiny people, but they eat a LOT. I kept having to ask if our food are coming or not, and few minutes after I asked, some of it came out immediately so I'm pretty sure they just forgot. I don't think it's acceptable for us to wait over an hour for certain few items (40 min for tempura and egg sushi... really?). I wouldn't come back here again."}
{"text":"Very back logged orders. We placed over 100 items and on a 1/3 came. They ended us giving dessert and all other item were disregarded.  I won't remember this place as they are very poor service using dinner . This is a Tuesday for dinner . Would recommend to come during Lunch less busy and price is cheaper"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for Father's Day dinner with both my family and my future in-laws. I haven't been to AYCE Japanese for over a year, but when my dad said he wanted to suggest this place, I decided to give it a try.   The space is actually very nice, it's large, spacious with a lot of comfortable seating space. Compared to the finch/leslie location, the atmosphere and the seating is definitely a lot better at this location. They recently just upgraded to the iPad system - my dad said last time he was eating here it was still pen and paper. Because it was Father's Day, it was already packed - we booked a 6pm table and when we arrived, it was promptly ready - group of 7. We sat down, and could begin ordering right away.  Their sashimi is pretty good. quality is fresh, and there are a lot of options to choose from (though not as many as some of the other AYCE in the past - they don't have red tuna!). The scallop & beef tataki only available on the weekend so we took full advantage of it. If you love raw beef - try the tataki!  Sushi - I tried both the spicy salmon and the spicy scallop, both of which are quite nice and tasty. The seaweed is still pretty fresh and not soggy when served, which tells me that the products are coming straight to us as soon as it's ready.   Grilled - eggplant - must try, they did a good job grilling it. Tempura also was pretty freshly done - shrimp, zucchini, taro and sweet potato were all very good choices. Their grilled/stirfry shrimp was really good and the mango shrimp was delicious! Another thing must try is their short ribs - they were REALLY REALLY good. My brother enjoyed the salmon head lol - for those who like to eat that part! their beef with garlic was dry so don't order that lol.   The ramen soup - my brother did not like his seafood ramen at all - said there was no taste. I ordered the beef ramen and i thought it was not too bad - it wasn't super salty and there was quite a bit of beef in it - however, i thought there wasn't enough noodles.. i barely got one full bite!  Rolls - mango roll must order. (there are two mango rolls and both were pretty good) a lot of their dragon rolls are pretty good (ther'e sa crazy dragon roll, or any of the green dragon/ black dragon etc those are pretty good as well). volcano roll was just average - I dind't particularly like it. We wanted to try the soft shell crab roll but it never came. Our hand rolls took forever to come. we asked staff like 3 times, and once with the manager but still didn't get them. finally we decided to order through the ipad again and they did come and were quite fresh - salmon avocado, eel., calfornia and spicy salmon are all good choices.   Drinks - they do include pop all you can drink, which is kind of nice since most places charge for the drinks. choices include ginger ale, sprite, coke, diet coke, nestea. They also serve tea by default as well.  In general, our food actually came pretty fast, which was good esp on such a busy day like yesterday since it's Father's day - the waiting area was swamped with ppl. But it's easy to order since you just plug a bunch of orders on the ipad and then they usually come pretty soon. some items took a bit longer (grilled) but the sushi and sashimi came pretty quickly - ASIDE from the hand rolls.. which i finally did enjoy 1.5 hours into my eating lol. They did miss some of our orders, and some items they actually ran out temporarily as well, which I wasn't quite happy about - no mango or green tea ice-cream, only vanilla and red bean available. and can't remember one of the items on the grill menu was also temporarily out.  Dessert - Their fried bananas are must try together with ice-cream. really good. red bean icecream was really good. I LOVE THEIR COFFEE PUDDING. it is like a shot of really good coffee/espresso taste - i had about 4 cups of them lol! the lychee pudding was not too bad, but the consistency was liquid since i don't thin kthey had enough time to set and probably because they were going through the desserts so fast. the yogurt with mango was also pretty good. the turtle grass jelly was amazing! i had about 2-3 of them (they all come in very small portions - almost like bite sized). mango pudding was too sweet - but for those who have a high tolerance for really sweet things that might be a good one for you to try. tiramisu don't try - it's not good lol. the creme brulee was meh - i only ate the top layer lol. they also have jello - my fiance and brother both liked them.   All in all their food and the quality was pretty good. ordering is relatively easy with the new ipad system in place, but perhaps the first time you try this restaurant should not be on a special occasion day (e.g. mothers day fathers day etc). But do come on a regular weekend and it's pretty good.   I will consider coming back again in the future, and hopefully next time I will be able to try everything I want on the menu without missing orders and certain items being available."}
{"text":"As an AYCE Japanese restaurant, Sushi Legend is in a league of its own.  We came for dinner last Saturday.  The sashimi was very fresh, but it was sliced very small; they are too small by standards of both AYCE and a la carte restaurants.  We loved the scallop sashimi the most.  We ordered 30 pieces of it on the second round, and they were gone in 5 minutes.  The sushi and maki rolls were not stuffed with lot of rice, unlike other places, which was good.  The Salmon Rose could look more like a rose, however.  The grilled food was also delicious if a bit too salty.  Salmon fish head and the rock shrimps were crowd pleasers.  Services were hits and misses.  The waitresses and waiters removed the empty dishes quickly.  The food came rather quickly.  On the other hand, it took them a long time to refill the hot water pot.  Some of our orders disappeared.  An order of iced tea went missing until we asked for it specifically.  Overall, this AYCE serves good quality sashimi, sushi, rolls and grills.  We didn't order any ramen or rice, so I can't comment.  This is the highest standard AYCE that I have ever had outside of downtown.  We will likely return for dinner again.   Please note that reservation for weekend is recommended, as this place is very popular.  Sashimi is unavailable at lunch."}
{"text":"I really do wanna give this place a good review because I used to come here a lot back in high school. But after trying many other AYCE restaurants Sushi Legend really is subpar in comparison.  First of all the price isn't even cheap, weekend lunch is $17, which is $2 more expensive than other AYCE sushi joints. After we handed in the ordering paper we waited 15mins to get the basic soup and seaweed salad, and that was after I complained to the server.   The food was really disappointing. The ingredients weren't fresh: soggy fish and bland overly frozen shimp in the tempura shimp. The presentation was horrible too, they basically just put the food on the plate and just serve that to you. I usually like to take lots of pictures when I go out to eat and this time I put my camera phone down because the food was just underwhelming. The chicken wings did surprised me though...just look at the size!! That chicken must have been just 1 month old.  Dessert couldn't save this restaurant either. The tiramisu was just a tiny cake plus a bunch of whipped cream. The was another dessert that was literally just whipped cream. The herbal jelly and mango yogurt were the only good desserts.  In conclusion, this place is overpriced, food with terrible ingredients, and bland presentation. Would not come back again."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best All You Can Eat Sushis ever! Great quality, as well as good service! Servers are always around if you need them! They have salmon roses which I'd die for! The desserts are also more than just ice-creams and I love them (except the red bean jelly!). I will come back to Sushi Legend."}
{"text":"This is my \"go to\" Japanese AYCE whenever I crave for sushi. The interior have nice decor, high ceilings and very spacious compared to Tenichi, Matsuda and Kaka. You can order through the iPad and it includes free soft drinks. There is a lot of variety of items on the menu. Special items include: scallops, Quail, \"shark fin\" soup, Lychee dessert. I highly recommend reservations because this place is always packed, service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Wow...not sure what the positive reviews are all about. Sushi is just average. Ordered seafood udon and also just ok. Kitchen was fast but service staff slow."}
{"text":"Sushi rolls were a good size but didn't find they tasted as good as other places i've been to. Menu was a bit limited. We also didn't recieve all the items that we ordered and kept having to ask/remind our servers"}
{"text":"A group of us were there for a birthday celebration on a Saturday evening and the place was packed.  We were seated all the way in the back room where they seemed to have seated all the large group reservations.    The restaurant was just as I expected, not comfortable but not so uncomfortable that it merited complaints.  The noise level in the back room was exceptionally high due to all the large groups that were seated there.  Bad planning on the restaurant's part.  The food started rolling out almost as soon as we placed the order but in no particular order at all.  The servers seemed to have no idea how to serve their food as they just tossed the plates on your table haphazardly and walked away.  We were pretty sure that they had left a bunch of plates we didn't order on our table and eventually we started asking them to take them back as we didn't want to eat other people's food.  Their ordering system is so chaotic that there is no way to ensure you're getting all the food you've ordered and I don't know how many times we had to reorder some items. To add insult to injury, their selection of fish is very limited and other \"creative\" items on the menu are just not good at all.  I particularly disliked all the sashimi dishes that came plated atop some unidentifiable sweet sauce.  It was just gross.    The quality of the food here is laughable and combined with their lack of organized presentation is just not something I want to experience again at any cost."}
{"text":"This is your typical, average AYCE sushi resto. The sushi/sashimi quality is fairly good (some more than others, I guess it depends on the day), the grill items are decent but everything else is...meh... the service here is also pretty typical of an AYCE place: slow and unfriendly. Also, the space is small, and located in a busy plaza, so it's always fairly crowded."}
{"text":"Was craving sushi, and wanted to stay local in Scarborough and this popped up so we decided to try it out. I was genuinely surprised how beautiful the inside of the restaurant was. It's very spacious for lots of room for groups and even private parties. We were sat down quickly, for a Friday afternoon the place was pretty busy. It was near 3pm, so we thought we would miss the lunch menu, but we did not which was great.   Checked in with Yelp and got a free welcome mocktail.  Orders are with the iPad, but the selection is pretty underwhelming. It had all the regular dishes you'd expect at an AYCE sushi, but that's about it, I wouldn't say it was anything super special.   All of our orders came in, but it did take some time for each dish to come. The food was okay to satisfy our cravings, but nothing amazing.   The place was clean, and the price for lunch was average.  Overall, it was okay, would I go there again? Maybe, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"This is not your typical AYCE food.  They have really unique options like bitter melon, chicken heart skewers, and for sashimi, they have scallops which is awesome!  The sashimi is really fresh and the food quality overall is very good.    This place can get really busy but they do take reservations.  The service is OK and the food comes out pretty fast."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night and made reservations for 7:00pm. When we arrived the place was already at full capacity. We still had to wait about 10 minutes for our table. They provide you with a sheet of paper where the full AYCE menu is displayed. You simply just write the quantity you want beside each item.   The service here is fast. Like really, really fast. No more than 3 minutes and the food started arriving and when the first item arrived it was like an assembly line after that. The food just came one after another, non-stop until our last items. In fact, they were so fast that I could barely keep up with taking pictures and shoving food in my mouth. Our table was so filled with food that we had to prioritize which items to eat first so we can clear off the dish from the table. I though it may have been a fluke that they were so fast but when we put our second order in it was the same deal. Hope they can keep up this great quality, speedy service.   Quality of food was excellent too. Large and thick cuts of salmon sashimi. The scallop sashimi which is only available from Fri to Sun was also excellent. Small pieces but still a decent size for scallops. It tasted way better than the ones at Sumo Japanese Cuisine. Another item that caught my attention was the BBQ eel sushi. There were actual large chunks of BBQ eel. Dessert was also another great surprise - creme brule. The online menu needs updating because creme brule was not shown online and when I saw it on the menu at the restaurant it made me really excited. I tried one creme brule just to see how it tasted first but it was excellent so I ordered another two for myself.   This place has all the popular items like scallops, tuna sushi, BBQ eel, beef sashimi and etc. The only thing I believe they are missing is shrimp sashimi and blow torch sushi. If they added these to the menu then this place will be unbeatable.  The only shortcoming was the deep fried items like the shrimp tempura and veggie tempura's. There was so much oil left on the tempura that it looked wet. Overall though the food was above my expectations for an AYCE restaurant. In fact, I may be so bold to say that this is hands down the best Japanese AYCE restaurant in the area.   $26.95 per person from Fri to Sun (Dinner)  4.5 stars because I really can't think of another Japanese AYCE restaurant that can beat this place."}
{"text":"First of all, this plaza is a hassle. There was absolutely no parking, had to park at a nearby complex. Avoid going on the weekend, that's for sure. On top of the parking lot issue, it's usually a long wait so try and reserve ahead.   The food overall was okay, didn't enjoy the quality of the sushi. I also thought the other items on the menu, such as the ribs, ride & noodle dishes were not great either. Overall the food was definitely a 2/5.   The service was alright, but when it's busy don't expect to get much attention at all. Also the desserts were basic, nothing great.   The only plus side to this place is there's free soft drink refills."}
{"text":"My Son and future Daughter-in Law took my Wife and I here for my Birthday.  They are critics of AYCE places, but they too found the quality to be above average.  Consistently excellent.  That's why it is always lined up outside the door!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out for myself  because of all the hype and 4-5 stars this place was getting from all fellow yelpers. And from my personal opinion....  This place wasn't all that amazing..   I believe this is place is overrated and not near or close to deserving 5 stars. The overall, experience at Sushi Legend was average. There weren't any kinds of food that was outstanding or 'AMAZINGLY GOOD.' It was just a standard AYCE japanese restaurant, despite that their menu is quite larger than other competing japanese AYCE restaurants.   I went for lunch  which cost around $14.95, so pretty much $15. I went with friend as well so overall it came to $33 something for 2 people. The price wasn't bad for the amount of food you get during lunch.   Food Quality: 7 Service: 8  Again.. all the sushi and and maki rolls were all pretty standard. I ordered spicy salmon sushi and spicy salmon roll and neither of those two were at all SPICY! It had the coloring and look like as if it were spicy but none were spicy at all. It's funny how they somehow got the coloring to look orange but it was just regular mayo.. That was pretty disappointing. Also the beef ribs were tasty but it had a lot of fat on it and very little meat therefore im eating 20% meat and 80% fat.. The quality of the beef ribs weren't any good.   They did however have some unique maki  rolls that tasted pretty good that other AYCE didn't have and some of the cooked meat dishes were pretty good too.   We also ordered some udon and ramen. Those were below disappointing.. but I should of known those kind of dishes were no good at any AYCE since they don't specialize in that anyways. Overall experience, the food came out pretty quickly and servers were nice. I would go back for lunch but definitely not dinner. Dinner costs way too much and I don't find it worth it.  Sushi Legend is over hyped for the 'AWESOMENESS' AND 'AMAZING-NESS' it's just a normal japanese AYCE place nearby the Finch and Leslie area which is convenient for the people living in the area so that they don't have to travel uptown to Markham or Richmond Hill to eat japanese AYCE. IMO take the travel uptown if your really eager for some AYCE sushi and better quality."}
{"text":"Best sushi bar! Love this place. Spacious, delicious and welcoming."}
{"text":"Great fresh food here for the lunch menu. Same as your typical sushi places. Staff are very friendly and nice. They use the tablet for ordering which helps speed up the delivery of food and frees up the waitresses. Def cone back here again :) lunch for Friday and apparently on their holiday was $19.95. It's Dec 9th, not sure why it's considered a holiday."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for awhile.  The food quality remain the same.  The wait was not bad on a busy night.  The food came quick.  the servers were friendly and helpful.  It was a nice exprrience."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Sushi Legend has been one of the AYCE places that I wanted to try ever since I knew about the Finch/Leslie opening. However, with the abundance of AYCE places that opened lately, it was put in the backburner until recently. I finally decided to try this restaurant after being in the area and craving some AYCE delicacies.  The interior was quite nice, as it had that palace/mountainous feel thanks to the decorations. It's quite big as well, but also busy, which wasn't surprising considering this is the only AYCE place in quite a wide radius.  There was a decent variety of sushi and sashimi, although sashimi is only available for dinner buffet. I always recommend for AYCE places to skip the sushi and stick with the sashimi, as you can down more food that way. They have two unique sashimi selections that are actually quite delicious: yuzu salmon and herb white tuna. Scallop sashimi is also available on weekends, though I found it to be nothing special.  I wasn't a huge fan of their grilled foods. Most of the items there were either too tough or too dry, with the exception of the chicken wings which tasted okay.   Service was good, and despite the large size of this place it wasn't hard to wave down someone to give the order sheet to. Overall Sushi Legend is a good place for its price point (under $30 per head), but there are better AYCE places out there with wider selections, especially for grilled items."}
{"text":"I liked their quality of food, but it lacked a bit in service and as a result of that I can only give them 3 stars. Our first order was lacking a few items, we told them twice about it, and ended up receiving the items with our desserts, which was a bit odd.  However, I probably will give this place another chance, cause I did enjoy their maki rolls and grill options."}
{"text":"This is a typical AYCE sushi restaurant. It was medicore. If you're interested in simply getting an AYCE experience and are not concerned with quality or variety so much, then this would be a decent place for that.  I've been to many AYCE restaurants and I thought I'd try this one since the reviews on Yelp were surprisingly good.  I came for lunch with three others and although they had a decent variety, the quality was lacking. When a sushi connoisseur says that it's all in the rice, then please believe it!! The rice lacked flavour and I had to rely heavily on the soy sauce.  The atmosphere was okay. It was modern and had banquettes/booths. The service was somewhat disappointing as they had forgotten our orders more than once. They also charged us for AYCE dinner when we didn't order anything from the AYCE dinner menu. They fixed that as soon as we told them though.   The price for adults on weekend for lunch: $15.95; for dinner: $25.95.  I am unlikely to return to this place as there are better AYCE sushi restaurants in the GTA/York Region area."}
{"text":"It's a very good place. However i dislike the location though. It's not very convenient for me get there by bus. It's a little bit cheaper than Tenichi. But overall it's almost exact  the same level as Tenichi. What i like about this place is that they included free drinks on the ayce menu. Most places do not provide free drinks on the ayce menu. So that's a bonus right there. Also i like the service, they are very nice and very quick. The only thing i dislike about this place is that it's a little too small. It's good size but it would be better if it's bigger. Anyways i had a great experience and i will be coming back another time."}
{"text":"I come here way too often. Whenever I am in NY with my boyfriend, we tend to always stop by Sushi Legend for some AYCE sushi. I believe that it is the best AYCE sushi place in the area. The environment of this restaurant is pretty good. They have booths, which is always a plus for the privacy when I am coming with a date.   They have a wide variety of sushi, rolls, appetizers, grilled, and desserts (the dessert menu is great). One of the many things that I like about this place is that the size of the sushi is not huge like other AYCE, which allows for more space to try other different types of sushi. They don't stack the sushi on a huge pile of rice. The dinner menu is more expensive, but it also comes with more choice of food (ie: salmon head, various other maki). The raw fishes are generally fresh.   The service is decent, having them messing up our order 2/4 times we have been there. The place is rather busy, which is probably why. It is also rather crowded during dinner time, so I'd call for a table before coming in.   I would definitely come back here again!  Tips: - Definitely come earlier if you are planning to get dinner here, especially during weekends - The soda/drinks is AYCE as well"}
{"text":"Great sushi all you can eat. Sashimi is only available for dinner menu, so even though we went during lunch hours, we chose dinner menu. Fresh sashimi and sushi unlimited. Beef tatake was awesome. Wish they have more variety of sashimi though. The restaurant was packed and somewhat noisy as most of their customers were families with children. I would go again though."}
{"text":"Much better than it used to be. Now they offer seared and torched sushi, scallop sashimi on weekends, all other sashimi any day, and lots of skewers and grill items. iPad ordering is very helpful as you can see photos and send orders whenever you want. If you've got a big group I'd suggest sending in your sushi orders first then look through the menu while you wait.   Even though it's sushi legend, my favourite items are from the grill. I like the stir fry garlic shrimp, beef short ribs, the enoki beef/pork wraps, salmon head (too bad they don't have belly), and seared sashimi. Of course finish off the meal with green tea and red bean ice cream.   The sushi rolls and sashimi aren't that great. They use too much sauce and rice in a lot of the special rolls.   At around $37 per person after tax n tip on a weekend, it's pricey. But that's how a weekend dinner at buffet or hot pot is nowadays.   Soft drink included."}
{"text":"Overall great experience.   We went in group of 9 and they accommodated us really well. A quick note, if you are a group of 8+, you should call to make reservation as they only got one table that's big enough.  Food is pretty good. The sushi and sashimi are better than the average of other AYCE places. The beef tataki and the scallop sashimi are really good. The tempura and teriyaki items are on par with the rest of the AYCE places. Their desserts are very... very... GOOD!  Service is good, not outstanding, but we were a huge group and I felt we were taken care of. The speed is relatively fast comparing to other places. However, whenever we put in a big order in the Ipad, the sashimi's are always the last the arrive. We do get the number of pieces we asked for (unlike some other AYCE sushi place I've been to), and it's not that long of a wait, so it's not a big deal."}
{"text":"Better than usual AYCE sushi place. Lots of sushi and non-sushi options. Fish was top notch and rice properly flavoured. Rolls were better than most AYCE I've tried and were roughly the same size as ordering at a non-AYCE. Other stuff not as good: beef teriyaki served beyond rare, pad thai looked and tasted orange. Service was pretty good once we were seated. Lots of staff wandering around means your order sheet is taken quickly once shoved in the air and empty dishes are cleared away within seconds of emptying. No system at the door leaves a crowd by the entry/exit and whoever gets the attention of the staff first gets a table first; no way you're getting to sit first if you're in the door first but not remotely pushy. $14 for lunch during the week, 15 Friday through Sunday and holidays. I believe it was 6-7 more for dinner, but sashimi options are available."}
{"text":"3.5 stars - another all you can eat, another legend. My fiancé's family frequently get dim sum, Asian comfort food at this shopping plaza (paradise, congee wong, Asian legend). Somehow although sushi legend has opened close to a year, none of them has heard or noticed this place. Thanks to yelp, we chose to come here for one of our many Ayce dinners.   4 of us arrived for our 7pm reservation and were seated immediately. We studied the menu/order sheet extensively before submitting our first round of order. Food here is definitely portioned out for people to sample - the rolls are tiny (maybe half the size?) not just by pieces but also by diameter of fillings! After our first round of food came out, we learned how much more we really needed to order. Every serving we then asked for quadrapled. Everything we sampled was quite tasty - loved all the sashimi in Yuka sauce, beef capacio , mango tango roll, seaweed salad, fried flounder, shrimp tempera. They had a nice selection of desserts too - all bite size! Loved the custard with cookie/cake crumbs and assorted ice creams!   Service was ok. Every order we submitted would miss a dish or 2. When we asked for more ordering sheets - they gave us used ones with marking still on them?   Price is a bit steep but worth trying out. Although the lunch buffet price is half of dinner and there seemed to be over 75+ items listed, nothing but the dinner only items stood out (no sashimi for lunch), I personally wouldn't make my money worth by coming here for lunch. But for those who love noodle, regular rolls, and all the tempura, side dishes etc. this would be the ideal place to feast!"}
{"text":"Like Larry David says, \"Pretty good, pretty, pretty good\".  I went for lunch ($15.95 on weekends), on a Sunday, just before 2pm, and the place was packed.  Reservations are probably a good idea since a lot of the reviews say that this place is pretty busy - unless you go on an off-hour.   My review may be slightly biased though 'cause I'm from Mississauga and all the AYCE sushi places there are just meh, re:  Yang's, 168, Saki (although haven't been in a coupla years), Spoon & Fork, K&B (Oakville), Sushi Hour (also Oakville).  (I haven't been to Heart Sushi OR Sushi Sushi, but I'm not exactly holding my breath for either of those 2 places!)  Food:  Contrary to a lot of AYCEs, everything was pretty good.  Rice was slightly warm, seasoned, and soft!  GOOD ratio of fish:rice, not packed like most places.  Tempura was not over battered or greasy.  Kalbi was nicely seasoned, not too fatty.  Sushi was well-rolled, not falling apart, sloppy, or just plopped on the dish.  Actual size of sushi pieces are smaller than average, not HUGE so you end up stuffing yourself even more!  Soft drinks were included.  Larger than average selection of desserts and good selection of non-sushi items.  Service:  Reservations were made for 1:30pm and we called 15mins beforehand to let them know that we'd be 15mins late.  When we arrived, slightly after 1:45pm, they had given away our table.  Not a HUGE deal since we only waited 10-15mins for another one!  Despite the busyness, most servers were not rude or impatient.  No dishes were wiped out onto the table.  VERY efficient staff, whatever was asked, they provided ASAP.    All orders were fulfilled.  Nothing \"forgotten\" or \"missing\".    Again, I hate to admit this, but the AYCE places in the West-end (Miss/Oak or even Etobicoke) just don't compare to the places in the more Asian-y cities - especially since their pricing is more or less the same.  Sad, but true!"}
{"text":"For an AYCE sushi restaurant, I was pretty content. Usually the most common problem with AYCE sushi places are that you end up not getting a couple of dishes that you order (regardless of how the order was taken either it be by iPad, order sheet that you fill out or taken by a server), but our table of 9 got every single thing we ordered.   Sushi rolls were decent sized and the sashimi wasn't cut too thick or too thin. The scallop sashimi was sooooooo good, had this natural sweetness to it.   The only downfall to my first experience here was that we got this really weird table, it was... Like a picnic table. Our food would fall \"onto the table\" only to have it fall through the cracks on the table and onto our feet/pants. You're probably thinking, \"how much food do you even drop?!? Are you slobs?\" well, imagine if I spilled soup on this \"table\", that would not end well at all."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of AYCE sushi as sometimes the quality is compromised, but this place was really great!  Super fast service, nice ambience and the sashimi was delicious!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here it was good. The second time the sashimi wasn't fresh. I had better sushi else where. The lychee dessert and enoki beef wraps were the best of the place. However, the table beside us were eating like champions. It depends on your expectations of food."}
{"text":"To be honest ive been here a bunch of times. Food is great here no complaints. But sometimes you place a order for something and it just doesnt come ...."}
{"text":"This is a standard ayce sushi spot. Nothing is particularly great and nothing is horrible. The price is right and the drinks are included so that's a plus.   I highly recommend going during lunch to save a lot of money! To be honest I would not feel like it was worth it if I went at dinner."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi places by far. What separates these guys from everyone else is the service.  The manager who wears the dress shirt is always accommodating and professional.  I don't like my sushi or meats with any sauce they accommodated all my needs. With a smile and no fuss.  This place beats sushi caca.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"First time at Sushi Legend after coming to this Leslie-Finch plaza for years! Was generally impressed at the selection, quality, and service of the all you can eat. We came in at 1pm on a Sunday and were promptly seated with the option of either AYCE lunch or dinner. The main difference is that dinner includes sashimi while lunch does not. With all the options on the iPad ordering system, my friend and I had more than enough choices even without sashimi. First and second rounds of food arrived lightning quick with perfect accuracy. Fresh, check; great dessert selection, check; weekend lunch for two plus tax and tip for just over $50, check! Another nice perk was that unlimited soft drinks were included in the AYCE. Would definitely come back despite the notoriously difficult plaza parking!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Sushi Legend more times than I can count. It's the go-to restaurant for my family events as it offers a wide variety of food for everyone.   If you're looking to go on weekends, make a reservation! This place gets so crowded it will make your head spin.  In terms of food, the quality of the cooked food here is similar to all the other AYCE. The sushi and sashimi on the other hand are disappointing and sloppily prepared. The fish slices are thinnn  I find better value from other a-la carte sushi restaurants. Everytime I eat here I never feel like I ate my money's worth"}
{"text":"3.5/5 overall  Solid price for ayce sushi Atmosphere: 4/5 large table and comfortable chairs, plenty of seats, well-decorated, clean than other sushi places Service: 4/5 the service is nice and the food came pretty fast  Food: 3/5 sashimi is not fresh, special rolls for dinner are good ( I do enjoy the first two items, one is Angel rolls). Shrimp tempuras are tasty. They always miss some of your orders, so keep ordering! Price: 26$ for weekdays dinner, same as tenichi, I prefer a la carte places since the final bills are same and they offer way better sashimi"}
{"text":"Well, tried many sushi resto in Toronto, compare to the others all u can eat, this is my favourite one, cuz the sashimi and sushi is good, and also the BBQ. I like to go to this resto as its taste is fairly good. Recommend."}
{"text":"Positives: staff was friendly; sushi, sashimi, ramen tasted good; liked the ordering style(esp good if there's a language barrier) there's paper menu you fill out and hand in; area was clean  Negatives: food from the grill or that was fried had crossed flavors (ie. Our beef teriyaki tasted like fish, one of our deep friend sushi rolls tasted like bananas); asked for a drink refill, was brought napkins; asked for a glass of water, they refilled the tea pots; half our dessert order wasn't brought to us; one guest didn't want dessert, just another order of ramen, and that item was missed(we suspect they only looked at the dessert section of the menu); half of the grilled items we received tasted very dry.  We went there for my brothers birthday last night.  It looked like a nice place, but there are so many AYCE Japanese restaurants I would rather go to.  I would go back as a guest for someone else's event, but I personally wouldn't choose to go there."}
{"text":"Came for lunch.  A bit pricier than I thought but the food was decent.  Everything we ordered came.  Decent desert and includes drinks.  Nestea was real Nestea.  Rice wasen't disproportionate to the sushi/roll which was good and allowed me to have to hide less rice.  Cooked items were decent.  Short ribs came quickly unlike other places.  Overall satisfied"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on a Thursday night and the place was packed (thank goodness for reservations).  We did mot gave to wait long for our 6:30 reservations which is great.  Service was really quick but mediocre (typical Asian restaurant service).  Food was average with some dishes better than others, and a good selection of mini desserts.  I really liked beef ribs, garlic beef steak cubes, rock shrimp, soft she'll crab roll, and my family said the sashimi wasn't bad (I do not eat raw stuff).  Prices seem higher than most AYCE sushi restaurants because the drinks are included.  Tip: Make reservations."}
{"text":"Just another decent all you can eat place. I've been hearing a lot of hype about it and since their second or third store opened I decided to finally give it a try. I never have high hopes especially when it comes down to AYCE. I was pretty disappointed in the service and the food. The sashimi was warm and the sushi wasn't amazing either. The interior is comfy but no matter how nice a restaurant is quality in the food is important. There was nothing good in particular with the cooked food either. I would much rather go to matsuda or tenichi! Overall the best part of the meal was dessert. I really liked all the options I had for dessert and it was good. I'm not sure would I ever come back but maybe the other location is better? Last call is at 10pm including dessert."}
{"text":"yay just as consistent as their leslie&finch location! good service and yummy food!  only thing I can say is that it seems their layout isn't quite as great, with a lot of big tables randomly placed.   but I'm thankful for the opening of this location since its in such a convenient plaza closer to home :).   also. they have free all you can drink soft-drinks!! that's pretty awesome."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the food! there's a lot of choices and some of them are reaalllyy great but I'm a huge fan of sashimi and it's not amazing here :p but! +another 0.5 for their bigger dessert selection ANDD their free soft drinks! I feel like more AYCE places should offer free drinks!  Management is also very friendly and service is great. Once you're done a dish there will pretty much be someone who will take it away within a minute :D"}
{"text":"Great spot, enjoyed a wonderful lunch ayce. Sushi was nice, I liked the variety available, and they had more dessert items than usual spots. Definitely want to return here with my wife.  Oh and the ambience is great too, nice ordering service to go along with it."}
{"text":"We came for the a la carte menu as oppose to the all you can eat. First thing I noticed is how massive this place is. It can probably seat up to hundreds of people.   We placed our orders on the iPad (fancy) and got our orders shortly. I got the kalbi bento while my fiends ordered the sushi and sashimi combo. I thought my kalbi was really good but everything else was just average. You are not getting the best of quality here but hey, you get what you pay for. My bento box was $16 and it came with salad, soup, 2 pieces of soggy shrimp tempera and some Cali rolls."}
{"text":"This place is becoming a go-to for lunch whenever I'm in North York. This is the only sushi place I've been to for lunch that has green dragon rolls and they taste fantastic!  Everything I ordered tasted super good and came out quickly even though it was pretty busy. The service is friendly and attentive; the cost for lunch is great for what is available but dinner is on the expensive side.  Overall one of the best all you can eat sushi places I've been to and I would definitely recommend going here if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The best all you can eat sushi in town. The quality of food is unparalleled to any other place I have been to recently."}
{"text":"Sushi Legend is in my top 3 picks for AYCE sushi. This isn't the first time I've been to this restaurant. I can say that I'm a regular and some of the waitresses recognize me by face.   They're welcoming and accommodating to the number of people that come in and out throughout the day. It can get very busy depending on the hour or the actual day. I find that the restaurant is very spacious and aesthetically pleasing.   Although it is difficult to communicate with the servers due to the language barrier, many of them try their best to bring in orders efficiently within a reasonable time frame. If they have trouble communicating, they will bring someone else to help understand.   I appreciate the use of iPads when it's come to ordering AYCE. A drink with free refills is included. Prices may vary from Monday -Thursday, Friday - Sunday, & holidays, depending whether it is lunch or dinner.   For the food itself, sashimi, or salmon roses are my top picks. You can taste and feel the coolness and the freshness when eating. I also like the shrimp & yam tempura, spicy seafood udon, shrimp fried rice, and many more. All the food items are served within reasonable portions and there is a wide selection of appetizers, sushi, maki's, hand-rolls, side dishes, and desserts. From the time that I started going here, I've seen a lot of new food items to choose from, which adds to their selections.  Overall I find Sushi Legend my go to restaurant whenever I am craving for all you can eat sushi. I highly suggest this restaurant if you're going on a date, eating by yourself, or even celebrating an event."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening. I had a positive first impression with the decor and the hostess at the front who led us to our table.  After that, service quickly became disappointing. We were not given any menus to order from. We had to take them from another table. After the first round of dishes, it took them 20 minutes to bring the second round. We kept looking over at the tables beside us who received their food in a timely manner, and wondered if our food was going to them!   The food itself was enjoyable. Don't have any complaints about the food. The sashimi was fresh and the hot food items were yummy.   Overall, good food, poor service."}
{"text":"Pretty good spread here for a lunch buffet at $15-16 per person. Includes everything like pop and dessert EXCEPT sashimi (that's only for dinner buffet). However, everything we got was on point.  We kept ordering the endamame because it was amazing. Hot and roasted with salt, it was amazing! Seafood salad was fresh too.   Pretty much everything you order from here is delicious. However I'd say to bypass the volcano rolls (they taste like nothing and they're deep fried). The mango sago doesn't taste sweet, so just order one if you want to try it. So just order like 5 shots of mango pudding and mango yogurt because that's the best dessert. My friends thought green tea and red bean ice cream was good too.   Staff is very attentive and fast. Kudos. It gets busy even on weekdays so might be a wait... We went at 1230 and it was filling up.   Parking is a hassle. Good luck.  I'd come back again for the amazing price and food."}
{"text":"This new location is great! Service was fast, sushi was scrumptious and delicious, I'd recommend the sushi legend roll as it was legendary, atmosphere is exquisite as long as your company is adorable in total I shall give this place 10 legends out of 10, bone apple teet! P.s washrooms are soooooooo nice for selfies hehe"}
{"text":"I was here for a late lunch on May 1st. You can opt for the Dinner menu during lunch if you are willing to pay the $26.95. I didn't get to try a lot as it was there on my own.  The standout for me was the salmon sashimi in yuzu sauce. I could have ten plates of it. It was very good. Everything else was good. Above average AYCE sushi. I don't know if it is the worth the drive for me from Etobicoke but if I was in the area I would go."}
{"text":"Cheap & fresh All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi & sashimi  They also have ramen, udon, takoyaki, etc.  The desserts were very bland though."}
{"text":"We got take out from Sushi Legend based on the reviews on yelp. Wow that was a mistake. The portions were so small for the price that was charged. If we were at the restaurant & it was AYCE then that might be understandable. Anyway, hubby & I ate the food. Today we're dealing with major stomach upset. I'll spare you the details. I won't be getting take out from here again & I wouldn't eat there either in person either. Low quality food."}
{"text":"Was here on a Monday after the lunch rush with a group of 6 other friends and we were squeezed into a small centre table when they were booths and we were a large group.  They took a while to understand what we had wanted (which was very clear) and had to repeatedly come back and ask for clarification.  When we ordered our first round, food came out relatively fast and tasted very nice.  The sashimi was delicious and so were the wide assortment of meats and appetisers.  However, as we went on, the food started coming out slower and slower to the point where we had to continuously remind the waiters of our food.  By the time we had finished, there were significantly fewer people in the restaurant and many empty tables.  At first, dessert came out relatively fast but as time went on, our table had ordered a few more desserts and they were completely forgotten.  Unfortunately, they also did not have the creme brulee at the time.  Once we'd paid for the bill, we were waiting for the change as well as to give tip, but they totally disregarded that.  We had to physically go up and remind them as they handed over our change and as we tipped them.   We had ordered ONE plate of beef tataki but the server was giving us FIVE, and we had told them we'd only ordered ONE.  The server simply said, \"let me see your iPad.\"  We then showed her our iPad and she walked away looking extremely annoyed at us...   All in all, the food was decent, decor and atmosphere were good, but service needed improvement.  Wait times were very long, especially when there were few people in the restaurant and many chefs on hand (five of them could be seen in the front of the restaurant).  Not my first choice, probably won't be back.  If I could give them half stars, it would definitely be a 1.5/5"}
{"text":"Went to Matsuda AYCE on Don Mills at 5:30pm last night and the place was full due to a big party that was already booked.  Luckily with the use of Yelp, I was able to quickly find another AYCE place that is nearby and found Sushi Legend.  I was really excited to see some very interesting items that I don't normally find at Japanese AYCE places which included salmon tataki (raw salmon thinly sliced seared with a vinegary sauce), beef tataki, and scallop sashimi.  If you like sashimi then this is the place.  It's so nice to have just sashimi instead of sushi (with rice).  The sashimi here is really fresh and salmon was nice thick pieces which I don't usually see at AYCE places.  And the grilled meats are delicious especially the grilled squid, curry pork skewers, and the enoki beef.  And there was also a big selection of desserts which were all very good.  We had similar issues that other Yelp reviewers mentioned which is that they forgot some our orders.  But the staff were very good with helping us to get the missing items so we were not too bother by it.  The prices are a little high but it's worth it if you like sashimi."}
{"text":"Sushi Legend is an affordable and great place for AYCE lunch.   As I was seated down, l was given tea and two identical menus where I could write the number of how much I wanted beside the dish. All of their dishes tasted similar to any other AYCE sushi restaurant. Sushi Legend also has refillable drinks included to the menu. Their desserts were really good too, I really enjoyed their Mango Sago.  Unfortunately, like every AYCE sushi restaurant, they forget to bring a few of our dishes. Although, it was a good thing they didn't because we were pretty full. Also, the tea tasted watered down.  I really admired the interior and decor of Sushi Legend, especially the table we were sitting at.   Also, service was pretty good and all of them were pretty nice."}
{"text":"TYPICAL AYCE LUNCH BUT BETTER THAN OTHERS  Food is what you expect at an AYCE during lunch. Quality is good and similar as others. Variety is pretty good too.  Service was great and definitely better than others. Very fast and helpful. They were able to cancel one of our orders since we were full, the kitchen already made it but it was stil okay."}
{"text":"On a recommendation by a friend, we came here for dinner with a large group including many children. I felt like our group was well accomodated, and left very satisfied. There was easy and efficient ordering via ipad, with the aid of coloured photographs and portion size in brackets. This means that you know how many pieces you are ordering when you select the item.   I liked the variety of food. It came out quickly after an order was placed, and it was fresh and seasoned nicely. Food was also good quality. I particularly liked the short ribs, garlic steamed scallops, torched sushi, and pressed sushi. There was a good ratio between fish and rice (not an over-abundance of rice), and the food was prepared well (sometimes you can tell when places are rushing and their pieces look sloppy). The only thing I thought needed improvement was the fried milk and tempura banana dessert - it could use a bit more flavour but was still alright.   The staff were excellent and unobtrusive. We never had to ask for anything twice. I felt satisfied and would return. I suppose that you get what you pay for - the price is steep, but worth it. I read about people having issues waiting for a seat. We made a reservation ahead of time and did not have to wait - would recommend others do the same."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my mother recently. This place is more for ayce, which isn't something my mother can do. Their ayce prices are pretty high, about $25, but it seems like a pretty good menu. Still, I can go downtown for cheaper and almost as many menu items!  The à la carte dinner menu was small and difficult to choose from since there was also a side menu that said \"lunch specials\" on one part so it looked like you couldn't order from it. Realising we could, we saw that this was the more reasonably priced menu and choose two things to order. I see a sushi set and my mom had udon. The udon was massive and had a nice broth.  My mom noted that it seemed the employees were eager to have us out quickly, but I didn't notice. They were probably heading up for the dinner rush, since we entered around 5:30, which is pretty early for dinner."}
{"text":"The place is alright. It has nothing remarkable. It tends to get pretty busy it gets very hard to get a table without waiting for about 20-40 minutes.   The price is a little to high if you compare it with the quality of the food. An extra feature is that they have free refill drinks.   The staff speak very little English(close to none some of them) so don't bother asking questions, they will just nod at you and smile."}
{"text":"I'm the type of person who repetitively revisits a new place until I find something wrong with it. I came back to Legend 3 days after my first visit and there were some differences.   First, I went back for the weekend menu .. and the only difference is that it includes sashimi scallop for $2 more.  & for my family it was definitely worth it.  (BUT, when we put 20 ... they gave us 10)   All of my previous reviews still holds true but there're some slight differences.  First, I realized a lot of the items we ordered don't arrive .. at all. & then for one order, they decided to ignore all of my sushi and rolls but managed to serve all my sashimi.  I loved their beef teriyaki - it was semi raw and deliciously cooked.    The server also refilled my boyfriend's drink multiple times but ignored my sister & I :(   Overall, the previous review still holds true (esp about the dessert and rolls)."}
{"text":"It's actually more a 3.5 than a 4. My experience wasn't bad. I'd come here again. I came here for lunch on a weekday, and it wasn't crowded at all. There were a few tables, but no wait. I think lunch price was around $15.95 or so? Lunch price doesn't include sashimi, which, along with a couple other things, is under dinner price.  //FOOD\\ Food portion is very small, so don't be afraid of over ordering the first time around, even with desserts, which are served in half a shot glass. Nigiri pieces have super thin slices of fish. The chicken heart skewers are only 3 half-hearts on a stick. These portion sizes are good for getting a sampling of everything, especially if you're with friends. But watch out for fried stuff and starch dishes (all the sushi is rice heavy), those will add up quickly in your belly. The only thing that seemed more normal sized were the fried rice and noodles, which I saw someone at another table order.  Taste is alright. Grilled items are extra heavy on the oil.  //SERVICE\\ Service was quick. Orders didn't take long to arrive. The staff seemed okay to me. They didn't seem unfriendly or rude.  Overall it was okay. I would have been happier if they had some sashimi during lunch or if nigiri fish pieces weren't served paper-thin."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in a week! This place is good and has a wide variety of foods to choose from. They have pressed sushi which you don't see at other all you can eats. The wait times can be from 20-40 minutes - it's always a full house. It's quite expensive but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for lunch. Today the sushi tastes fresh but they didn't bring out our chicken wings and kalbi, and some dessert. We like the iPad order style and pop included. Spacious indoor seating area, looks better than its outside appearance. skip the udon soup and go for the spicey beef ramen. for desert the better ones are lichee pudding and mango pudding. We would visit here again only if TA convenient  but need to keep an eye out for our order so they don't forget. Service is pretty fast and the ladies work pretty hard."}
{"text":"Sushi Legend is one of my favourite AYCE sushi places in the area! Came during lunch on a weekday and the bill came to $40 after taxes. A bit pricier but worth it (even though they don't serve sashimi during lunch hours). This place gets packed real quick during lunch time- by 12:30pm every table was occupied and there was a wait list.   What I like most about this place is how it's ALL booths (there are some tables where there's chairs on the other half too). For me it's something about eating in booths that makes the food more enjoyable. The restaurant is clean and so are the washrooms.    Staff here are great- service is quick and very attentive. Food came out speedy, empty dishes were cleared promptly and drinks were always refilled.   The food here is great too, I especially like how their sushi, rolls and hand rolls are not stuffed with excessive rice like most AYCE places! I would recommend the spicy crab meat hand roll, so good. They also offer a lot of dessert choices for the lunch menu."}
{"text":"This is my friend's go to place for AYCE due to distance and quality. The food here is good considering it's AYCE.  Don't expect high quality, but do expect that they have plenty of quantity. It has the standard fare of sashimi, rolls, hot foods, cold apps, dessert and drinks, just as it does with forgetful service and not serving you 100% of what you asked for. About $30 a person for dinner. Can't complain too much."}
{"text":"I don't think I will come back again.... Service was quite bad, food tasted either over sweetened or lack of flavour. We made a reservation for 9 ppl for 545pm, and they told us we were late as our reservation was supposed to be 530pm on their book, and so we were told we'll have to wait since they were cleaning the table. Ok, make sense. HOWEVER, the next group of ppl came and told them they had a reservation for 9 as well, they got seated right away. I mean, REALLY?! Have you ignored us? We didn't get our table til 615-620, which was almost half an hour later than expected. We had toddlers and kids with us, they were so hungry by that point.   DEFINITELY will not come back!!!"}
{"text":"I come to this sushi legend at least once a month (typically two or three times a month!!) and I absolutely love it.  The food is great and the servers are super friendly. Leila is the best!   My favourite items are the cheese wontons, the garlic beef cubes, the fried rice and the pressed torched salmon. The sashimi is great for AYCE sushi. I have never had a negative experience at sushi legend. I hope they open more locations some day."}
{"text":"C'mon, I gave you a 5 star before WHY would you screw this up and mess it up on customer service.  When I tell your mackerel has gone bad and it taste different than what it usually is, why would you argue with the customer that this is how it's taste. DO you really think I had never had mackerel and that I do not know what it's supposed to taste like  Disappointed. This is a good resturant, to screw this up by arguing with the customer about your food is not how business should be run..........   As an elite 2018, I do not suggest coming here anymore until they learn to take customer comment in stride. It's not about the food, is about how customer service should be done."}
{"text":"For an AYCE sushi restaurant Sushi Legend is decent.  Service was fast and friendly.  Food was good, not the best.  But what else would you expect from AYCE restaurant.  One thing i like though is that they offer aburi (torched sushi), it somehow breaks the norm from your regular sushi place.  Plus it taste great. Oh and that beef tataki is awesome, we just kept on ordering that all night.  I was pretty surprised on how effecient and fast the service was even on a holiday dinner.  The place was packed, but our food did not take long to arrive.  Unlike other AYCE restaurants where they tend to forget or take forever with your order.  They place is pretty big, clean and the decor pretty good.  If your looking for a sushi restaurant where you can get your moneys worth, this the place to be, just dont expect 5 star quality."}
{"text":"The food was alright. The place was packed with families on a Sunday afternoon. The portions are small, which is a good thing if you want to try something for the first time. I like the variety of food options, since my friend is not a sushi fan. He ordered chicken skewers and Asian rice. The tiramisu was 2/3 whipped cream and 1/3 biscuit.  I liked the sunny sushi roll (great for spicy sushi lovers). What I did not like about this place was the service. They pay little attention to customers. They throw the food on the table and worst of all they brought my friend hot water with a straw when he asked for water. He burned his tongue! :("}
{"text":"I come here on my anniversary every year and my experience has been great!   Service is fast and food has good presentation  The staff are extremely friendly and all you can eat comes with free and unlimited sofa + desserts   Sashimi is fresh and never disappoints   Price is your typical AYCE ~ $30 something for dinner with tax and tips per individual   Place is pretty pack on a week day with an average wait of 10-15 mins before getting seated but nothing too too long."}
{"text":"I liked this AYCE, they have some unique items on the menu but was not able to try them all. The food quality is good for a buffet but they did forget our orders twice so there were periods where the table was bare and we were just waiting for more food to arrive. I don't like having to flag down waiters to follow up on forgotten orders.   They also like to put mayo on a lot of items so if you like your sushi neat, you can ask them not to put mayo. I would give them 4 stars if the service was better... Having a busy restaurant is a blessing and not an excuse, they should staff dinner service appropriately."}
{"text":"A great AYCE sushi place. The portion sizes are small, which I find better for AYCE, and the sushi is fresh. Sometimes the whole order doesn't go through and I find myself reordering food from the first wave. My favourites are the mussels, mango pudding & yogurt, green dragon roll and mango roll."}
{"text":"After placing our order of food it took quite some time for it to arrive at our table. In terms of quality, I don't see what the hype is about. I wasn't very impressed with the service and the good in my opinion was okay for buffet style."}
{"text":"Hands down the best ayce in Toronto. Everything comes out of the kitchen fresh and hot.  The yozu salmon is a must try!  This place definitely kick matsuda and tenichi in the butt."}
{"text":"Came to Sushi Legend on a Friday afternoon for a late lunch and had a good experience.  I don't frequent AYCE that often but I won't mind coming back again if my friends invite me to join.  Give yourself a lot of time. Even coming here on a Friday after 2:30 the service was still a little slow. It took us a hour and a half to finish our lunch. All the food we ordered took awhile to arrive and we were also served with food that we did not order.  I do like how their rolls and sushi are not a mega piece of rice ball. They were small bite size piece and at least you won't be overdose with carb. So if you are a big eater, you can order more pieces of different varieties.  Hot food is decent too. The tempura shrimp though as of small size but tasted fresh and not mushy. The beef ribs was well prepared.   There are also quite a good selection of dessert all served in mini portion. Good thing you can try quite a few of them but they all just sloppy prepared.  Sushi Legend is decent as an AYCE and if you are not too picky about Japanese food, you might enjoy the experience at a decent price point."}
{"text":"2.5 Star but round up to 3 star because it is relatively new.  Sushi Legend is another new AYCE Japanese restaurant located in Finch & Leslie Square.  The interior is nicely decorated and have a lot of booth seating for small group which is great since they offers quite a bit of privacy too.  Lunch Special till 4:30 pm that gives you the choice of either lunch set from $6.95 or AYCE from $12.95 depends on the day.  Sushi Lunch Bento Box ($8.95) was A-OK. The shrimp tempura was nice and crispy and fried to perfection. The sushi though aside from the salmon all tasted not super fresh, however the rolls are nicely made! I will suggest if you are a big eater, go for the AYCE option as I was just half full after that bento box!  Services is fast and maybe too fast. I was given the bill even before I start eating my dessert?! For dessert, you do have a choice of ice cream.  Grand Opening Special 10%! or if you want to be real cool, check in with your Yelp App and get 10% off!  Management is sincere in looking for improvement as he really asked me how everything is and what to improve. This is quite rare in Chinese run restaurant!  BTW, they really needs to work on their website.... it is just so amateur!"}
{"text":"Located in Leslie & Finch. We had weekend dinner there, around 25 dollar pp. Sashimi and sushi are all very fresh. I love the scallop sashimi, sweet and juicy. The orange juice salmon tastes good. High recommend this popular spot."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Used Yelp check in and got a welcome mocktail.    Food selections are normal, nothing outstanding and \"all you can drink\" must be order by telling the server.   Service are slow.  Many orders didn't show up and have to re-order after 30 mins of waiting.  Lunch price was $18.95 + hst.  Tips was not included in the bill."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in Scarborough. My picks are enoki beef roll, spicy salmon, mango yogurt, sizzling flounder, shrimp, and some of the other items in their menu.    you order using an ipad so you wont need to wait for a server if you need to order more.   washrooms are clean and the place is pretty busy which means fresher food."}
{"text":"I love this place gali so much. SASHIMI IS FRESH!  FAST! Nice staff. Great service! Good price! I go there few times a month!"}
{"text":"Wanting to try a new sushi place I went here based on reviews.  The place was mobbed and there was a line.  They were pretty good at seating people, but once seated it took quite a while to get our food.  The way they brought it was ridiculous, tiny portions at a time, so the lunch we had took about twice as long as it should have.  It was clean, the staff was alright, but extremely inefficient.  I've had better AYCE sushi at 168, Tatami and Spoon and Fork, so no reason to go here again."}
{"text":"Finally there's good ayce sushi in the area. The food comes out reasonably fast and the food is good too. Now the stand out food items- spicy salmon sushi, volcano roll, enoki beef roll, beef negi maki, spicy seafood udon soup. Avoid the chilled tofu, curry pork skewers (100% fat), and green salad. PS The pop is free here!  Update: Went here again and discovered yet more good and bad items..  Good: sizzling flounder, rock shrimp  Okay: fried rice  Bad: Any of the ramen dishes. Gross. Beef tataki sashimi, herb tuna sashimi or something like that, maguro hand roll.. actually hand roll because there's too much rice, scallop sashimi- ordered ONE and it came out as a small plate unlike how the rest of the sashimi is served. Don't order unless you want to risk having to force down an entire plate of excessively smoothly textured raw scallop down your throat"}
{"text":"Overall not too bad of a place, though I did expect better! I came for AYCE on a weekday at lunch, and it was about 19.99$ (I think don't quote me haha). I found the sushi to be really good, as well as the fried udon I got! Not the biggest fan on their dessert selection. I saw several reviews about Creme Brûlée, but I didn't see it on the online, or in-person menu? The decor of this place is absolutely beautiful. Fell in love the moment I walked in.   One thing is the servers vs food runners. You either need a more distinctive uniform between the two, or just train food runners as servers too. Even just to order a drink (their all you can drink pop), the food runners had no idea what I was talking about.. and I kept calling them instead of servers because I couldn't distinguish between them lol.  I've been to so many AYCE sushi places now, and still, none can top my fave Matsuda haha. Sushi Legend you're in my top 3 tho!"}
{"text":"The service is good!! If you're looking for a decent all you can eat restaurant around North York you can consider this as one of the must go to.   With a variety of selection at a very reasonable price, it made our 30 minute wait for seats worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got tired of going to the same sushi place. We decided to try this new \"grand opening\" sushi legend. Love the food and restaurants atmosphere. Great for parties, family and friends gathering. I really like their circle booth, allows you to have your own privacy.  Most importantly their washroom is CLEAN, good service, amazing food and it's LESS pricey than other AYCE! Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"Great new place that recently opened up service is always great and food is served in a timely manner"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Great service. Great quality with a large menu. If you are into ayce sushi...This is a great place to try."}
{"text":"Surprisingly pricey! I came here for a birthday dinner about a month or two ago. The group I was with was quite large, and we ended up paying approximately 35 dollars per person. I understand they automatically include a service charge, but this was a Wednesday night dinner and not the weekend. In my past experiences, dinner on the weekdays had only been about 30 dollars. Not sure if there was an increase or not.   Service is pretty good. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly despite us being put in the back room. This place uses iPads as their ordering tool, but I would put it at around 80% in accuracy for what comes (if it comes at all). Not too bad for an AYCE place.   What I like about Sushi Legend is that there's a wide variety of items on the menu. Something for everyone to enjoy. I know that more AYCE places are expanding their menus now, but Sushi Legend has always had a larger selection than what I've come to expect.   A solid 3.5 stars. Would definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"The food is good, sushi is great and the service was even better. It was super busy, but we did not have to wait too long for a table. When we sat they brought our food relatively quickly, and always refilling our drinks and clearing our plates as soon as we were done. Also, they have a pretty large selection of desserts compared to other places which is awesome!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Monday and it was 20.95 per person. The menu selection was very slim. There is not a lot to choose from. Pop drinks are free and unlimited. The quality of the ingredients were okay, not that fresh though. There is no sashimi available for lunch AYCE and that was disappointing. I do not think I got my money's worth and I don't think I will go back. I rather go to Teni-chi's."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this sushi place. I was there for dinner at weekend. While it was busy but they still have good and fast customer service. Their sushi is done very well with attention to details. They have good grils and hand roles. Desert option were abundant and tasty :)"}
{"text":"Second stop on my 3 day trip to Toronto.   Came for supper with 3 other people on a Wednesday night. We arrived around 5:30 and we had to wait 15-20min for a table.   They don't have a good waiting area, so everyone's kinda cramped and squished against each other.   Got a table and there was some sort of sticky liquid on my chair. Not cool.   Ordering on the iPad is always nice. Quick and convenient!   Their sashimi is so fresh! Such big, thick pieces. I loved the salmon!   Since I wasn't ordering, I don't know the name of the rolls, but all the ones I had were delicious! They came in 4 pieces, so we got to try a bunch of different ones.   Unlike some of the other reviews, I did feel rushed. We were still eating and a waitress came by to ask us if we were ready for ice cream. (We were not. We were waiting for our order to arrive).   The desserts were great! All of the. We're very good! The red bean ice cream is a favourite. The crème brûlée was surprisingly well executed for an AYCE. The tiramisu was a huge letdown. Do not get it! All the portions of dessert are super small. Do not worry, you can eat one of each, no problem. I believe in you!   All in all, great meal! Came to about 35$ per person."}
{"text":"57 minute wait on a Saturday night. People walking in off the street being sat before waiting customers in the lobby. Not cool, but they take reso's, good to know for next time.   First time here, so we decided to let it go and see how \"good\" the sushi was and what all the hype was about. Let's just say the hype was pretty real.   The sushi was all fresh. So was the rice. Everything that came out sushi wise was fresh and good. Things ordered off the BBQ SECTION came out hot hot hot. Service was very fast and the food was almost the best I've had for an AYCE sushi joint.   Unfortunately they lose some stars for not having any mango ice cream on a Saturday! HOOOOOOW?! That's the best thing on the menu!   Anyways. Pretty good AYCE. I will return. Good bang for buck here.   3/5!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars overall. 3.5 for service.  Went for lunch. Place was almost packed but still had somewhat attentive service. Really mediocre food but at a decent price. The noodles, tempura (veggies only, the shrimp was meh), beef and rock shrimp were the highlights. It's hard to describe why I didn't like the rice...it just didn't taste good. The raw fish was the worst part about the food. It just lacked quality but had average amount of freshness. The variety of food is average with reasonably sized portions. I like their selection of pop and desserts at least. If I'm coming back again, it would be for dinner because there is no sashimi for lunch."}
{"text":"Finally the grand opening (10% off special) is here after many months of waiting. Inside the restaurant is really spacious, much bigger than the Leslie/Finch location. Lots of waiting room if you have to wait for your table - but it wasn't packed when I got there. There are booths to the side and in the middle there are tables they can move around for smaller or bigger parties, and add more tables if needed. Interior has nice modern decor and pretty lighting fixtures.  Food is mostly the same as the other location, with some new items (ie. general tao chicken - spicy, not loaded in flour as some of them usually are) on the menu. Bonus points for ayce drinks too. We only ordered a lot of sashimi, didn't really have any sushi as they are pretty filling for us.  Service was decent, I was surprised with how fast the food came out since it was a grand opening (but then again they weren't a full house yet). Though, clearing the table of empty plates might take awhile. Oh, the tables themselves are pretty spacious as well.  If this is your first time for dinner here, some recommendations:  - Yuzu salmon sashimi - Beef tataki sashimi - Cheese wonton - Fried shrimp with mango sauce - Rock shrimp (same as above but with mayo)  I will probably return to this location as it is closer to me than the other location."}
{"text":"So I came here on a Saturday evening for dinner with the lady, and I have to say the sushi was pretty good and all,  but the only con about sushi legend was the service,  horrible service, and the iPod menu pick wasn't even working that well. We would order items off the menu and we would never get them,  that was the dissapoining part of it.  And there are people that don't even speak English here and they are working as servers,  how is that even possible....  Anyways Il leave this review at this, nothing exciting happening here if you like sushi give a try but you won't be 100% happy at the end."}
{"text":"This place is spacious and there is enough for a family with a stroller. The variety is good and the food quality is not bad. Their service was quick and they have lots of staff to attend to you. The sushi is pretty tasty, as were the other japanese food items. However, it is still a bit pricey for a Scarborough joint on a lunch, around $24 per person. WE enjoyed out experience as I was needed a sushi fix after being pregnant for 9 months, and this place did hit the spot. It is comparable to Ten ichi, although I did find their food quality similar if not better."}
