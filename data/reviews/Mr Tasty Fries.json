{"text":"Oh, poutine, I wish I could quit you.  It's a bad habit, though with the price of cigarettes these days, dare I say cheaper (and more delicious) than smoking.  This is the \"blue chip truck\" in front of Nathan Phillips Square.  I had been told by several people that this may well be the best poutine in Toronto.  They weren't kidding.  Curds.  Lots of 'em.  And the gravy was a little salty, but not unbearable.  I'd use the word 'delish.'  One of the guys working in the truck the day I sampled the deliciousness was speaking French, and at a poutinerie (of sorts) that's a good sign.  I wish they'd make a road trip so I don't have to come all the way to Ontario for it."}
{"text":"For poutine, this is my favourite place.  Easily beats Smoke's aromatic offering.  I don't know about the hotdog or burgers as I think it's insane not to order the large poutine.  Poutini's is pretty decent.    The fries are nice, chunky, and satisfies my body's need for grease.  The gravy is thick, tasty, and well spread on the fries.  The cheese is nice and creamy.  For seating, anywhere in Nathan Philips Square.  Just be sure to kick the pigeons and seagulls out of the way first.  Whatever you do, don't drop any fries or else they will all fly over to your area.  Would I drag a friend to this place?   Yes, I've done it before and will do it again.  During the winter, I just be a man about the weather and tough it out while greedily munching my fries.  I'll endure anything to get more of this delicious poutine inside my body."}
{"text":"I walked by that truck for nearly a year and I always wanted to try something. So on New Years Eve I finally did. The line up was huge but after the fireworks I managed to get something without waiting half an hour.  We had a large (really large) poutine and a veggie burger. The poutine was ok, the fries were pretty good. The veggie burger was, how do I say that: poor. A small veggie patty, one slice of tomato and a small piece of lettuce. But at least the food came fast and didn't cost a fortune. Maybe I'll try it again another day..."}
{"text":"The prices has gone up, maybe its just for the pan am games but disappointing to see it. Gravy ain't free anymore."}
{"text":"This \"chip truck\" * was the 3rd stop on the Yelp French Fry Crawl - Part I. The 1st stop was Jamie Kennedy Wine Bar.  The 2nd stop was Beer Bistro. That's some big fry shoes to fill.  Luckily, Mr. Tasty Fries has huge feet. (And you know what THAT means.) The fries are the long, thin variety but thick enough so the crisp exterior yields to the hot tater creaminess that lies within. They're sprinkled with some kind of orange crack seasoning that makes them impossible to stop shoving into your maw.   Small = $2.50  Medium = $3.00  Large = $4.00   We sampled the goods from the other trucks on the block and they should just throw in the towel and call themselves, \"Mr. Non-Tasty Fries I\" and \"Mr. Non-Tasty Fries II\". Their spuds were bland, fat, globules of potato mush. **  Oh, and I'm still waiting for my colonic coupon. _____________ * Why do people call it a \"chip truck\" when it's serving up skinny fries and it's called \"Mr. Tasty FRIES?\" I thought chips were those thick-cut potatoes you get in fish 'n chips. ** We ended up giving them to the \"broke & hungry\" panhandlers that hang out in Nathan Philips Square. Hey, beggars can't be choosers."}
{"text":"the food is so awesomely delicous!  The owner is very friendly and it's obvious he enjoys working in the hospitality industry.  The prices can't be beat.  A real canadian-style poutine runs you about $4 and with a burger, it only costs $$6.50.  The beef in the burger is hefty - no skimping out on portion size!  He only accepts CASH payments, though.  Maybe that helps to keep overhead costs down.  I'm heading there again today for lunch ... CAN'T WAIT --YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Anytime I'm downtown Toronto I make sure I stop by this food truck.   Their poutine is, by a long while, the best in the city.   I can't say anything about their other food, because I have only ever had their poutine, and that really speaks to how amazing it really is.  This place will have a place in my heart forever."}
{"text":"After my first week working in the area. I gotta give it to Mr. Tasty for being the cheapest lunch I've had to pay for... and filling too! For Fat Friday, as coined by one of my coworkers, we took a short walk from the office and headed towards Nathan Philip Square. Mr. Tasty is there everyday even thru the winter. The medium poutine at $5.50 was very filling. I'll have to try the hotdogs/sausage another time - didn't want to go into a food coma at the office.  One of the ladies did make a good suggestion tho... they should have a half serving of fries or poutine so we could get a combo fries and sausage/hot dog for more variety. Still... Mr. Tasty is a great option for straight forward un-fancified poutine or street meat.  There's another fry truck a few feet away, but you gotta go to Mr. Tasty... The name says it all ;)"}
{"text":"Killer food truck at Nathan Philips Square.   The serving sizes are generous compared to the low price, and the folks running the truck are adorable. The fries are really delicious and well cooked. There are a few options for sausages, and all are really tasty. Wait time is short and on a sunny day you can enjoy your food anywhere in the Square. Overall, a good, traditional chip truck."}
{"text":"I would say the best chip truck we have in Toronto!  Poutine there is amazing with quite a generous portion of cheese curds. Spicy Italian Sausage always cooked to perfection and never had an issue with under cook meat.  The old man that works in the truck is super friendly and prices are fair compared to all the nearby chip trucks. In the summer it can get busy because so many people just want to have lunch outside nathan phillip square. Definitely a favourite if you're craving street meat and yummy poutine."}
{"text":"Friendly gent in the truck. Satisfying cheeseburger and oh those fries! Hope to see you again soon when I'm in the area! Keep them fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"I would rather roll around in diarrhea then eat here, that doesen't even make sense as a substitute for eating food but I would rather do that then eat here.  my fries had.. bone in them or something.   Now I understand why I see people vomiting so much in Nathan Phillips Square.  If you're really hungry try eating one of the pigeons walking around near the truck, I think I've noticed that even they have enough taste to mostly avoid the food from this truck.  this goes for all the chip trucks on this little strip"}
{"text":"There isn't really a \"Canadian cuisine\", not like French cuisine or Italian cuisine....so I think poutine is the closest thing we've got (the American spell check on this website doesn't even recognize it as a word, that's how Canadian it is).  For the visitors (non-Canadians), poutine is thick cut fries topped with cheese curds (they MUST be curds, any other cheese type is unacceptable) and covered in dark brown gravy that is so salty, it will have you waking up at 3 AM feeling like you've spent 46 hours without a single drop of liquid in your mouth.   But oh how it is worth it.  The poutine at this particular truck is the best. Which, as Connie mentioned already, is located near Nathan Phillips Square....so you can skate around the rink at NPS and then go grab so poutine claiming that \"you've earned it\"."}
{"text":"Best Poutine west of Quebec.  Pretty much every time I visit Toronto, I'll make a trip to Nathan Philips just to visit the famous blue truck and its no-frills Poutine.  This is the ultimate comfort good: perfectly cut and fried potatoes, ample cheese curds with just the right scrunchy/slightly melted texture, and the kicker - a rich, beefy, uber-savory gravy. Dude should have a patent for this brown goodness."}
{"text":"Came here for the poutine while in search of the best poutine in Toronto. I had high expectations and I think that's why I was disappointed. Overall a good poutine. But they don't use Quebec squeeky cheese curds. Also gravy wasn't hot enough. Good value. Got a small it was really filling.  Lakeview's was better. But almost double the price. Would probably taste better if it was 3am in the morning."}
{"text":"I think this place might only be good for its poutine cuz' the fries sucked.  I went to this placed based off of Susan C's review and was let down. These fries were very mushy and greasy. Plain and simple. Would never recommend this unless you .... nope can't think of a reason to recommend this place. Sorry!"}
{"text":"I am a poutine purist.  I don't like fancy crap on top - just crispy, tasty fries, flavourful gravy, and genuine cheese curds with texture (bonus points if they squeak a little bit when you bite them).    This fry truck serves the best poutine I've had west of Ottawa.  I've tried poutine all over the city, from Smokes to Bier Market to fancy pants places like the Drake.  All of them try to do too much with what is supposed to be a simple, post-clubbing type of food that should hit the spot (the greasy spot).  This poutine comes closest so far to the benchmark poutine in Sherbrooke."}
{"text":"Amazing poutine. There is always a line up. Curds are nice and squeaky, gravy is thick but not congealy. Fries are crisp outside and soft inside with nice potato skins on em.  Lots if ppl get the hotdog fries combo so it must be tasty. Personally I don't want to waste calories on the hot dog when the poutine is so phenom-nom."}
{"text":"The guy who works here is really friendly and his fries are great!  Not crispy but a definite must if you are in the area....."}
