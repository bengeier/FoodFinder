{"text":"Ordered the red curry with shrimp. While flavourful, the shrimp were overdone and rubbery. Possibly made my stomach upset.

***

After a few more tries, I'm avoiding this place. The previous owners made such yummy food, despite the lacklustre appearance of the dining area. The new owners have jazzed up the place, but the quality of the food is less. The flavours aren't as sharp and the cooking is decidely average."}
{"text":"Hmmmm, I'm not really sure what happened here....did it change ownership?  It used to be pretty good, but the last 3 times we've ordered the food has been a disappointment.  I'm fairly certain the springs rolls came from a box, and the long bean tofu, which used to be so good, was short on both long beans and tofu and long on the raw onion slices (gross).  Curry was super salty and underwhelming too.  I'm not sure if I will try again...."}
{"text":"Food is decent but portions are WAY too small for the price.

Chicken dishes included too much vegetable \"filler\" making it suitable for 1 person only (not large enough to share).  Seafood Pad Thai included very little seafood (2 shrimp). 
Even their \"oodles of noodles\" didn't include a large enough portion of noodles to split between 2 people."}
{"text":"I am serious about Phad Thai and picky about it too. Since I was in Thailand I have been looking for places that make it in the way I got from the street vendors there. This is the place. I crave it. 

Overall all the food is good. Friends that I have brought in love it too. Service is quick. the food is consistent. It is very reasonably priced. The place is comfortable."}
{"text":"i could almost give it 4- stars . but the quality can be hit or miss.
phoning in can be problematic , best to walk in.
the best deal is of course lunch or dinner specials. most of the favs are on the list ie currys and pad thai. both excellant. 
flavour is top notch, portions could be a little more for the price, but considering the area, still a good deal.
pad se ew (approx spelling) is tasty but might be a little greasy/salty.
over all , a great choice for thai in the area."}
{"text":"My sister and I did not have a good experience here. When my spring rolls arrived at the table, the inside was cold and I had to take the shrimp pad Thai to go because it was undercooked and tasteless. Not going back"}
{"text":"This place is convenient for me, right near my apartment! So I get take-out often. 

Pad Thai and spring rolls are my favourite choice (I swear I'm not bland..) and like Julianna said, no ketchup pad thai here. Great portion sizes, delicious soup and great service. The atmosphere inside is clean and modern, take-out is fast. 

I highly recommend it! Best thai in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food!  Best price and taste in Toronto!!
I've been there more than 10 times."}
{"text":"I've gotten the pad seew and other noodle dishes a few times and liked it very much.  Today I decided to get chicken wings with my order and for 7.99 I got 5 pieces of very I mean VERY VERY small wings.   Not too sure if they've changed up management recently but the servings seem smaller.  Don't get me wrong, I'll still go back but never again for chicken wings"}
{"text":"I haven't seen an old friend for a while and we didn't know where to go. He suggested Taste of Thai House, since he lives right around the corner from this restaurant and he claims \"it's an amazing thai place\". Of course, I follow my natural instincts and quickly yelp the place on my phone before agreeing to give this place a try. Along with my friend's rave about the place and Yelp's glowing reviews, it was convincing enough to have dinner here.

The place is small and wasn't as busy at all. The waiter was extremely friendly and the service was good. As always, I love my phad thai and ended up ordering that for dinner. The food came out quickly, but as soon as I took the first couple of bites, I knew I would not return.

The phad thai screamed sugar, sugar, sugar. It was sweeter than what I'm usually used to and the new sweetness wasn't something that interested me. 

The prices was more or less in line with other Thai restaurants. 

Not a place that I would recommend nor come back myself. There's tons of better Thai restaurants out and around Toronto."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised after eating at this nice little place on Vaughn road.  The food was very good and there were plenty of choices.  It was very affordable and the place was not very packed.  I would suggest going for lunch as it does not seem like a place I would go for dinner.  The specials where very good.

My only complaint is that the waiter seemed preoccupied and did not concentrate on my order or on my table.  I had to ask for my drink 3 times before it was finally brought.  And one time all I got was a glass of ice but no drink.  I asked for an extra five minutes while choosing and about 15 minutes later he came back, even though I had made it very clear I was done choosing what I was going to have about 10 minutes earlier.  The place was not very busy and he was not the only waiter so I can't see any reason for this.  But on the bright side he was kind and our food did come so this one is a good place in my book."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from this place and I have been meaning to try it forever. When I saw the relatively positive reviews, I was hoping that it would be able to differentiate itself from the many terrible Thai restaurants that this city has to offer. It didn't

I ordered takeout and walked over to pick it up. I started with the tom yam vegetable soup. It was just a boring broth with no real kick and no reason to order it again. Hoping for better, I moved on to the beef curry pad thai. This was incredibly disappointing. It was like they took pad thai (which was not even made that well) and dumped a bunch of curry sauce on it. I don't think that is how you are supposed to do it. They needed to better integrate the flavours because this version didn't work. 

While it's one of the few local restaurants in my neighbourhood that looked even remotely promising, I don't think I will give it another shot."}
{"text":"I stop by here quite often for take out. The service is alway friendly and the food is delicious. I'm a big fan of the spicy eggplant,  the pad see ew and the pad thai. Lunch specials are also a really good deal. They've renovated relatively recently to make the experience more inviting to dine in, which I will be trying soon."}
{"text":"A cute cozy little place that serves simple yet fresh and tasty Thai food.  I especially liked their red curry chicken (had a good zing to it)."}
{"text":"Tried the Glass Pad Thai.  It only had two shrimp (tho there were good-sized ones) and really, really could have used more green onions.  That being said, it was still very tasty, but not REALLY classic Pad Thai.  For two people: appetizer (shrimp chips with AMAZING warm peanut sauce), two noodle dishes, tea, and tip, came out to less than $35.00 CDN.
Not bad.  If I was in the area again, I'd prolly do it again."}
{"text":"NB: Taste of Thai is temporarily closed; check their Just-eat link to find out if they're open yet."}
{"text":"This place is delicious.  The food is yummy, and tastes authentic.  I really enjoy the Pad Thai and the Woo Sen which is a glass noodle stir fry.  Amazing, just thinking about it, makes me want to order.  Its nice to see they updated a bit.  Place used to be a tad grungy."}
{"text":"Taste of Thai House, you sly little fox, what is it that you grind into your Spicy Beef Salad that keeps me coming back?  Seriously, I wake up the following morning dreaming, wishing there is still some left in the fridge to bring for lunch.  Sadly, there never is.   
  Although I've yet to peruse the entire menu, the few items I did sample warrant solid compliment.  The shrimp satay delivers, as do the soups.  However, minus one star for a sad pile of flavourless, gray noodles, masquerading as Pad Thai. I fished out the two lonely shrimp and tossed the glistening pile aside with disdain.  At least  lime wedges were fresh.  Maybe I should stick to the sides.
  Will visit again."}
{"text":"I don't care how good the food tastes or how friendly the waiters/owner is (which, btw, are at a 3-star level). If you are willing to charge your customers for the first bowl of rice they have their curry, you show the distance you are willing to go to screw them over.

I have not been to a Thai place or any place for that matter where rice is not complementary when you order curry. Charging $2 for the first bowl of rice with curry is like charging extra for the tortilla of a burrito. You see, rice is by no means the star of a curry dish, but not having it does significantly compromise the experience. Same can be said about tortilla vis-a-vis burrito. There is nothing wrong with a burrito bowl, but it simply doesn't offer the same taste, texture or experience when you sink your teeth into an extra large carnitas burrito.
 
If you want curry from the place, please automatically add $2 to the price shown on the menu. Unless, of course, you don't want rice to go with your curry."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed. I love the Penang curry and switch up the meats for variety. I love the pad Thai as its not all saucy and tomatoey. I am a noodle monster and I love the glass noodle pad Thai because I can easily shovel it in my face. A favourite is the Thai hot fish sauce, we tried it for something a bit different and really love it. I'm very glad this place fell on my doorstep"}
{"text":"Just dropped in today for the first time and the space looks beautiful! The staff are very  kind and very friendly. I ordered the chicken and shrimp pad thai and really enjoyed it. The taste, presentation, temperature, and texture were spot on. 

I was planning to eat in but I couldn't handle the music: it was adult contemporary cover duets. There were three of us in the restaurant, and all of us were waiting for takeout...just sayin'. 

My hope is that they nix the music altogether (especially anything with vocals), as it's very distracting and unnecessary, especially since the beautiful renovation and the food speak for themselves."}
{"text":"I've both dined-in here and ordered their food for delivery.  Both times, I've come away full and satisfied.

The Pad See Eu is just the right portion size, and isn't disgustingly greasy as some Thai places offer.  The veggies are fresh and it's prepared to order.  The pad thai is authentic and delicious, as are the chicken spring rolls.

In takeout form, the mango salad retained its crisp and freshness, and the green curry with beef was perfectly apportioned for two lunches over a bed of their jasmine rice.

The wonton soup was a little lacking in flavour, but otherwise, the only negative part in two separate delicious experiences.

The restaurant itself looks pretty low-grade, but don't let appearances fool you: the food here is great, with unpretentious and made to order service.

Go!"}
{"text":"Yuuum.  Been there enough times now to know I won't be disappointed. Usually I get the Khao soi, or pad see ew, but do try their noodle soup, and pad thai, it is all very authentic. I find the location convenient once you been there, but tricky when getting there by car, if you are not lucky enough to find a spot in the street in front. 

nice decor, friendly staff, and tons of food for a good price."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, real thai - both take-out and eat-in are reliable.  Great service - happy to accomodate or customize orders.  One of the places you'd think you'd get sick of ordering from, but never do.  Extensive menu provides many options.  We are repeat customers and can't believe we live so close to such a great place."}
{"text":"Surprising little gem in Clairhurst! Its recent renovation is very modern and looks more upscale than the prices suggest. I went in last week and had to do take out, as every table was booked - a good sign!

Another review here complained about the phad thai, saying it was too sweet. To that I'd suggest the Home Style version - it's umami heaven! Very complex and more sour than sweet. Between the little dried shrimps and preserved cabbage, every bite is different - It was delicious! However, if it's going to be leftovers, I'd strongly suggest heating it up - it's a little TOO sour when it's cold. 

Even though there was one server working the floor and takeout orders, he was very sweet and earnest. It's clearly a family affair - grandma was resting behind the counter. 

Bottom line, it's tasty, authentic, and affordable. Give it a shot!"}
