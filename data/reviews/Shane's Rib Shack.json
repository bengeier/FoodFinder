{"text":"My favorite spot. I love the fact that they offer gluten free options, label the order with \"gluten free\", and will immediately replace the food if it is not correctly made. I appreciate their willingness to go out of their way to offer options for those with food allergies. Love the BBQ, and the many sauces available."}
{"text":"We love this place. Always friendly service, and we like the food better than the bigger BBQ chains. My son loves the ribs and the brisket is outstanding! (FYI. The food at this location is far better than the Westgate location)"}
{"text":"I went with 7 others tonight for the first time & was impressed. I thought it was great fast food. The BBQ chicken was pretty good, the chicken fingers were surprisingly great & the hush puppies were fantastic. The fries were OK, the cole slaw was good, the sweet potato fries were good. The others I was with enjoyed the ribs & the BBQ (pork). The peach cobbler was pretty good & the peach (sweet) tea was tasty. I'm not saying it's the best BBQ or anything, but for the price & fast food, I think it's well worth it."}
{"text":"First time at Shanes for lunch today, the food was good for fast food, nothing I'd drive out of the way for.  One thing that shocked me and has never happened to me at a restaurant but happened here..... I was charged higher prices than the menu prices. To make it a combo menu said it was $2.99 my bill said $3.99, medium side said it was $2.99, my bill said $3.99. When asked about the error, I was told it wasn't an error and someone earlier  had also complained and the guy pointed to the small print that says \"prices subject to change\"..and then he mentioned because of the hike in the sales tax in Glendale????? This kid didn't know what he was saying! Bad way to do business, I don't even think that's legal for them to do that...I asked him so you can charge whatever you please? Wasn't in the arguing mood for $2, but I won't go back!"}
{"text":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible Customer Service from employees and Owner!  We decided to try this place after they became a partner with Southwests Rapid Rewards Dining.  On their website:  http://www.shanesribshackarizona.com/Promotions/FamilyMealDeal/tabid/61/Default.aspx  they advertise a $20 family meal deal for 1lb meat, 4 buns, 2 sides, 4 desserts and a gallon of tea.  Sweet deal right? When my husband went in to pick up take-out, the employees said there was no such 'deal' and the only $20 deal they had was their 4 Big Daddy sandwiches for $20.  He went ahead and got that deal since we were in the middle of a home improvement project and needed to get back to work.  When he got home, we looked up the 'deal' and sure enough there it was still on their website.  My husband called and got through to an employee after several attempts; she again said there is no such deal, but offered to give the phone to the owner.  When the owner got on the phone he first denied that the deal exited and after he was told it's on the website, he said it must be another stores website.  When we read the his stores address, unit, and phone number back to him from the top of the website, he gave up and 'thanked' us for letting him know that 'old' deal is still on the website and that he'd remove it.  He said they don't do that deal anymore because they don't have the gallon teas.  He then refused to honor the deal and make it right with us this time and only offered to take care of it \"next time\".  That's not how good customer service works.  If you make a mistake and then lie, lie, and lie about it, you need to fix the problem today....not \"next time!\"  And to think, we were even interested in the catering menu for an upcomming birthday; well, not anymore!!"}
{"text":"I would honestly not give this place even one star if were not for the waitress. She was friendly and professional. Beyond that the food was absolutely terrible. The ribs tasted boiled rather than smoked. You can tell when the meat comes off the bones the way they did. They were fatty and big, and were suppose to be baby back ribs. The cole slaw tasted as if it had come directly from the bag it had hardly any dressing on it. And forget the baked beans. If you like pork and beans with onion and sugar stirred in and warmed up then this is your place. I hate to write this kind of review on any restaurant. But it is what it is. I did not go in by my self all the people in my party felt the same way.  And it's really too bad, because the atmosphere is great"}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ restaurant was closed when we flew in on Sunday, so we asked a few.locals who recommended Shane's. I'm glad we stopped here because the ribs were delicious. The coleslaw and fried okra were good as well. The service made the experience a memorable one. We'll definitely stop again some time."}
{"text":"We have eatin at this place a few times, we went around 8 last night, the BBQ tasted like it was from the day before, it had BBQ sauce all over it, (think they were trying to cover the horrible flavor) some fries were hot others cold, hush puppies are the best thing this place has to offer! I will never go here again and waste $26!! I know we went at 8 and they close at 9, but u should always have hot food & food that taste fresh! Not day old!!n no stars for this place!! Oops it makes me do a star, ugh! Sorry it was the Shane's near  North Lake Mall!"}

{"text":"Love this place! Always nice staff. Awesome chicken tenders and wings, the sauce is addicting!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out from Shanes for my birthday Sunday. It took a while to place the order because of all the loud talking going on with the other employees during my call. The lady taking my order had to yell at them to be quiet because she couldn't hear me. She then said she was going to the back so she could hear me. I ordered 2 full slabs of baby back ribs and 2 lbs of pulled pork. My husband picked up the order and when he got home we all sat down to eat and found that they gave us 1 slab of regular pork ribs and 1 slab of baby back ribs.  I called immediately to tell them what happened and the lady told me that she made sure they put baby back ribs in my order.  I am 49 years young and have been eating ribs since I could walk. I know the difference between baby back and regular pork ribs. You can tell just by looking at the length of the bones. Word to the wise. Untie the knots in the bags and check you order before ever leaving the restuarant because once you're out the door you're on your own. They will not take responsibility for getting the order wrong."}
{"text":"Definitely not authentic bbq.  Had the pulled pork sandwich.  It comes on toast which i was not a fan of.  I was expecting a smokey taste in the pork.  It was not smoked bbq.  More like boiled, which was moist.  The bbq sauce has a weird bbq flavor, real tangy.  I'm big on bbq and this was not real bbq flavor and taste.  Food was good but that's it, just good.  Nothing over the top or something that i will be craving.  Probably won't try again."}
{"text":"Great ribs...very unique smokey and sweet flavor!  Fresh coleslaw...great wings. Average BBQ pulled chicken. Cute little place in a Happy Valley strip mall. This was a surprising and delightful find and we'll crave these ribs and be back."}
{"text":"Every time ive ordered from shanes I've always been pleased until last night. Ordered late about 45 minutes before they were closing and they had my order wrong. No way to call until  the following day. Now today I call and they say come but after work to correct my order from a male manager. Then I called to confirm I would be picking it up and they refuse to correct my order and the manager even gave me a name to reference I spoke to him. Her name is Natalie.  So Natalie refused to speak to me because of a dinner rush.  That I could come on a week day to get my order corrected. Terrible customers service."}
{"text":"Definitely a \"go-to\" BBQ place in Gastonia.  A good variety of options to choose from, at a reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite before a late movie and Shane's was packed!  This was around 8pm on a Saturday.  A couple things impressed me after noticing how busy they were: Always had ice available for drinks. Always had fresh brewed tea available. Bathrooms stayed clean (went in before and after meal). Order names were called loud enough to be heard above the crowd, yet not be annoying. Food orders were processed in a timely manner considering the size of the dine-in and carry out Customers.  And with all this happening, we still had a Food Runner and a Manager stop by just to ask if everything was good during our visit.  Way to go Shane's!!"}
{"text":"Food was definitely not best barbecue. City BBQ or even Damon's is better. But my biggest issue is the lack of customer service received from the owner. We had problem with our order and when brought to owners attention he basically said he can't do anything about it.  (You are the owner right?). he had a nonchalant attitude about it to. You can tell he didn't care about customer. Most business owners would want to keep the customer happy so they would come back.. Well you just lost a customer."}
{"text":"My first time! My children kept talking about this place. They are 19 years old with huge appetites and this place fits the bill. I had the BBQ sandwich with the absolute best okra ever as a side. My son had the monster burger with BBQ atop and slaw. It was too tall to bite. I grazed off their plates. Can't wait to go again. Well worth the money.....yum yum."}
{"text":"No need to go here, at all. To label this place BBQ is laughable. If you like slow cooked pork with HFCS bbq sauce on top, Shane's is for you. This is fast food, at best. Chicken fingers, burgers, etc.  There isn't even a smoker!  No love goes into the cooking.  No smoke ring.  I will never go here again."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Shane's has the best BBQ in town. It is moist, full of flavor, and the sauces are a great compliment to the pork.  This location is better than the Northlake location. It is cleaner with a friendlier staff."}
{"text":"Under new ownership  ! Loved the food then and LOVE the food and service now ! The Big Daddy is my go to. The kids never complain about coming here. Attentive staff."}
{"text":"The husband, toddler and I all went to Shane's for lunch yesterday at Westgate. We are fans of Honey Bears but thought we'd try this out since it close to our house.  I ordered the Smothered Pork Sandwich (coleslaw on the sandwich) with a side of baked beans, my husband ordered the pork sandwich on the texas toast with fries and my son had the cheeseburger.  First, let me mention that I hate it when the child menu doesn't offer the primary specialty of the place. My son ate half of my sandwich and not  a single bite of his burger. Perhaps my son is an odd-ball but he actually likes the same food we do. Next time I'll just order him a pulled-pork sandwich and call it a day.  The sandwiches were great and my son's burger was DELICIOUS. Their sauce is pretty good but I do prefer Honey Bear's sauce as I think it has a little complex flavor in comparison.  I think it will be a place we will use to pick up sandwiches on nights we don't want to cook - for sure."}
{"text":"First time ordering, and had it delivered.  Ordered  the large sampler and the brisket plate.  Sampler was ribs, pulled pork, and large chicken tenders that most kids would have scarfed up!   We were very happy with the order, portions and price.  Enough food for 2, with enough left over for lunch.  Sauces were sweet, tangy, and spicy. Excellent slaw, potato salad, and beens and Texas toast.  Corn on the cob would have been a welcomed choice.    To sum it up, Yes I will be ordering again, soon."}
{"text":"Ate here about a week ago,and i was very impressed by the great service and good food.Right when we walked in we were kindly greeted by the young man at the front.He led us to our table right away and told us our server would be right with us.Our server,Megan,was very friendly,and did an excellent job.I did not expect such great service at a place where you can order food at the Front to go quickly.Also,most of the workers looked like teenagers,which usually entails bad service.But not here.The chicken i got was cooked perfectly,and was tasty,as was the potato salad.the corn on the cob was a bit soggy,but still good.Even the     host came around clearing plates"}
{"text":"BBQ was luke warm, tasted reheated.  Mac and cheese fresh out of a box?  Baked beans were the best item on my plate.  Too much competition around to have so so food."}
{"text":"Great food. Good service.  Best place for quick bbq! The ribs were fall off the bone good. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I drive almost 30 miles to eat at Shane's!  The barbeque is delicious, as are the ribs and chicken strips.  The atmosphere is casual, and the staff is friendly.  So glad Shane's is here!"}
{"text":"Thank you Shanes for taking care of our FATman plumbing team today! The service & food was awesomely delicious! I personally enjoyed the lemon pepper chicken wings! Will deff be back!"}
{"text":"Amazingly great ribs and pork for a chain restaurant. Not to mention their delicious original bbq sauce. Easily better than some of the higher priced places with ribs with arguably better taste."}
{"text":"Nice, bright, clean atmosphere. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Baby backs were okay, but a little dry, which is the reason for 3 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome Bbq thought it would be a chain same ole same ole as its in a strip mall BUT not at all this is the real BBQ deal"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner, both my wife and I felt sick that night, kinda food poisoning queezy.  I think it was the chicken tenders or whatever they are called.  Bbq sauce was watery and gross.  Ribs actually tasted good and were tender, however due to the aforementioned issues definitely won't be eating there again.."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I like their sauce that they have at each table, especially the spicy version.  I get pork bbq and fries. Gets a little messy but thats cool.  Fast. Look for the value lunches. I like it because it includes a drink (you refill yourself)"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good for what we ordered. I ordered a cheeseburger and my husband ordered the beef brisket sandwich with beans. My cheeseburger was okay. My husband said his was pretty good. The beans were a little sweet which was unusual for beans. I would try this place again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Fingers/Tenders on the planet!! I've been there at least twenty times and had the chicken tenders nineteen times. The ribs are pretty good also. I'm surprised that they don't serve Hush-puppies but that is the only jab I could take. Just awesome."}
{"text":"Pretty decent! Love the environment, awesome sweet tea, and it is far from pricey!!! Great outdoor seating area & free wifi!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Tried the smoked lemon pepper wings and they were amazing!  Perfection!  Besides the incredible food I have to recognize the young lady that took my order, Victoria. What a friendly and happy face the moment I walked in!  She immediately gave me a smile when I needed it!  It was contagious. Thank you Hun. I would recommend this place to anyone. They don't skimp on taste!"}
{"text":"Dearrrrrr lord this is great food. And I'm from Texas. This is what I grew up on. I've tried everything in gastonia Lowell as I'm here for work and this is by far the biggest win. But one thing was very annoying. The green beans, they were blisteringly hot. I mean, SCALDING hot. And I poured all the juice out of the styrofoam cup and still. No hope.  I couldn't eat them. It seemed like a glitch in the matrix but they were NOT cooling down.  The little bit I did taste was good though"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, I enjoy the food and the staff is very friendly and helpful as well! The food is definitely great. Although it's a little hard to get to, it's worth the effort!"}
{"text":"Great food! Very nice inside with a great environment. Very friendly people as well! Will be back frequently!"}
{"text":"Love the place. Close to work, so I go there for lunch. Wish they would open one in Mooresville. Never got anything bad......"}
{"text":"this place has been good everytime me and the wife have gone. we swing by here for lunch once a week and for the most part we split the chicken tenders. we come here so often they often know what we want without say lol. Food has always been good and the service is always on point. we live out in peoria and theres one closer to us at west gate but we still make the trip out to this one. The food just seems better here. if your in the area swing by and give it a try."}
{"text":"Great chopped brisket.  We have been looking for a place like this for years where you can get chopped brisket by the pound to take home.  However, when we tried this place we were overcharged based on their online menu that we based our decision to go off of.  All the other prices were the same, but the brisket seems a little pricey."}
{"text":"Quick, clean and good.  Fried okra was done perfectly and the chopped chicken and pulled pork were solid contenders. A good option in the area."}
{"text":"Food was delivered to me cold and soggy , chicken strips had no flavor mac and cheese was disgusting! and I asked for forks and ketchup didn't bring it not to mention it took almost 2 hours smh won't be ordering here again"}
{"text":"Went back there a month ago, and it's CLOSED !!  I hope someone buys the franchise and reopens this place."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times trying to give them 2nd, 3rd, 4th,.... chances but it never got better :( if it went any direction it is getting worst. The food itself is ok but when it comes to service or the restaurant it is embarrassing. The restrooms smell like sewer (very bad). The owner she is not nice she is very rued.  If you do go make sure you go to the bathroom before going to this place and make sure the owner is not working and it might be ok."}
{"text":"Convenient but bland.  They didn't skimp on the meat, but they did skimp on the flavor.  Seemed like they boiled the ribs rather than smoke them.  A McRib has more taste than the ribs I had today."}
{"text":"Always delicious, melt-in-your-mouth, ribs.  Great sides.  Friendly service.  I've never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"It's worth saving up your appetite for this place..those ribs are slammin! Not only was the food great, but the staff was extremely friendly. Great food + great service = repeat customer. Thanks for teaching me to not boil my ribs ever again!"}
{"text":"Love the cashier Jamie. She was so nice and helpful. She represents the Shane brand well. She's a keeper!"}
{"text":"Great food, well seasoned.  Only complaint is more fries on my plate please.  A+ on gluten free options."}
{"text":"I gave Shane's two stars only because the wings have plenty of meat.  The service is a par below my favorite gas station Quicktime.   This is the second time here and last.  You would think cheese fries would not be an issue.  I was told that \"we don't melt the cheese\""}
{"text":"What is more discussable that regional BBQ? I've never met BBQ I didn't like. I tried the \"Shack Sampler\" with ribs, pulled pork and chicken tenders. I never considered deep fried chicken tender as BBQ before. Ribs were tender, but the BBQ sauce was way too sweet for my taste.  Pork was good but a little dry. Tenders were very good. Slaw was very good and the beans were ok. Staff was friendly and fast. Will I go back? Probably. Should you try it? Absolutely, if you like a sweet BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Server was upbeat, friendly and knew her stuff. She made several recommendations since we told her it was our first time there. The food came out quickly and looked good. We ordered ribs with beans and salad. The salad was in a small cup and was just iceberg lettuce with a little cheese. Not great, but ok. The dressing was ok too. The ribs were VERY tough and stringy and COLD. Also, they were nearly impossible to cut apart with the plastic knife (all \"silverware\" is plastic here). I had to saw away at them and finally gave up. So whoever said the ribs were \"fall off the bone,\" didn't get what we had. The beans were good and the buttered toast was pretty good, too. I will give the place another try to try the BBQ, but I'm not ordering the ribs! That's too bad for a place called Rib Shack."}
{"text":"It's hockey season again, which means time to eat at the Westgate mall and specifically Shanes!  I ordered the pork platter and sides. The plate came to me within a few minutes. There was a huge portion of pork. I usually have no trouble putting down food, but this was a bit of struggle.   I went with beans and mac and cheese. Both sides were good and warm.  The only disappointing part of the meal was the texas toast. The toast was subpar.  It tasted like a piece of regular toast. Nothing to it. That's not texas toast!  Overall, Shanes is still a place I will stop by when I hit a hockey game and indulge in some good BBQ or chicken tenders."}
{"text":"Wanted a quick bite of BBQ on our travels north. We were coming from Orlando and wanted some good grub to carry us back to PA. Shane's ended up being the perfect spot! It presents as a fast food restaurant but believe me, it is quality BBQ food. All 3 of us in our party got the sampler platter. It came with chicken or pork, ribs, chicken tenders, 2 sides, and a piece of toast. $10, can't beat it. I tried all 4 sauces placed on the table and they were great. Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I was turned away from Shane's rib shack after trying it for the first time out in Charlotte. When it opened in Gastonia I gave it another shot and I'm glad I did. Night and day difference in the care from management here because the food at this location is actually really well done for a franchise restaurant especially bbq."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times.  Every once in a while I get a craving for pulled pork sandwich, being that Shane's is 5 minutes from my apartment, it's pretty convenient.    Twice I've gone mid-afternoon on weekdays and the place was not very busy.  The pulled pork sandwich I ordered was pretty delicious-moist with great tasting sauce!  Mac and cheese is one of my favorite foods ever and I always order it as my side, but Shane's version is lacking some flavor (think school cafeteria).    Unfortunately I cannot say that the food quality is the same on busy days.  I went on a Sunday for lunch, waited about 20 minutes for my sandwich and was extremely disappointed as it was bone dry and bland as could be.    Shane's is hit-or-miss, but has potential."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Large portions. Kinda disturbing nobody has hair nets nor hair pulled up."}
{"text":"Well I am a BBQ fan I've gone to Shane's for several years.  It is ok but not great.  Service  is often poor and sides are often not warm enough.  Last Wednesday I tried it again.   I ordered a simply Big Dad Sandwich.   I sat down in a nearly empty dinning room After 25 minutes I decided to give up. No food or acknowledgment.  I left and will not go back again."}
{"text":"Great taste great service great peach ice tea was wonderful  got addicted since first time ;-)"}
{"text":"They charged us $2 for a water cup. The food was good but I found a big black hair mixed in with my pork and my husband found a small piece of foil on his ribs. We informed the server when she came around to check on us. She took it back and asked if she could give us a free cobbler. No manager came to apologize and no reimbursement was offered. When we started looking around we noticed BBQ sauce on the walls and servers flipping their hair around and leaning against walls with suckers in their mouth. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"nachos are more then plentiful crispy warm chips juicy pork hot melting nachos cheese spicy jalapeños damn good!"}
{"text":"The food is great but service meh. I always order to go and I literally had to wait 25 minutes for a chicken sandwich and baked beans while others came and went with their food and it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Just brought take out home and half of it went straight into the garbage.  Sides of cole slaw and potato salad were the only redeemers here.  2 full slabs of ribs slightly tasty but way too fatty.  No effort to trim any top fat from the ribs.  They leave the membrane on as well for those who like that removed.   Peach cobbler was an undercooked mess.  I understand ribs are not the healthiest of choices, but these ribs were just plain fatty.  Far better leaner BBQ options in the Valley Off to the gym."}
{"text":"When you walk in a rib joint and don't smell ribs, you know there's a problem ! I can't even say the food is bad, it would have to have flavor in order to qualify to be bad! It just sad!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great service and an extremely friendly staff! Food was brought out in an appropriate time frame. What was supposed to be hot was hot, and what was supposed to be cold was cold. Peach iced tea was fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Great food for great price. Will definitely recommend in the future. Boneless wings were awesome."}
{"text":"I've been past this restaurant many times, but never went in. I also have heard a lot of good things about the place. I finally went in about a week ago because a friend had given me a coupon for 6 free wings. The atmosphere is very stereotypical of a BBQ restaurant. Lots of reclaimed barn wood and old signs. We got carryout so I didn't stay in the actual restaurant very long. The service I did receive was very good though. The food and prices, on the other hand, were a different story all together. We'll start with the food. The macaroni and cheese was top notch. My fiance also said the potato salad was great. The green beans needed something extra to boost their flavor. The baby back ribs were nothing special. The most concerning was the wings. Lets just say I'm glad they were free because they were not good at all. We ordered the medium buffalo flavored wings and they had very little sauce on them. The lack of sauce made the wings taste like they had been boiled and unflavored boiled chicken is not good. I half finished two and threw rest away.  The food quality and food prices definitely did not match. For the price I paid for just the half rack of ribs, I could go to Texas Roadhouse and pay a few dollars more for excellent ribs. All in all it was pretty inconsistent experience."}
{"text":"If you're going to a Cardinals game, you got to stop by here before...just make sure you allow plenty of time.  We went to a Monday Night Football game and the line was out the door, and they only had one person taking orders.  Once we got through the ordering process (about 30 minutes), the food came very quickly and was great.  It is also reasonably priced for the area and had plenty of TV's to watch the games."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Shane's rib shack for about 8 years. The food was really good and so was the service but in the past 2 years it started going down hill. Today was horrible. The cashier had no personality. She stood their staring at me. I have never felt so uncomfortable and unwelcome at a place before. My wings were cold, my husband's Shack sampler wasn't all that great, and she forgot the condiments that comes with my daughters meal. When my husband got up to ask her she looked at him, rolled her eyes and walked away. We never got the condiment. We use to love coming here but every time we do, we are reminded why we wait so long to come back. I will never return back to Shane's."}
{"text":"The food and service were awesome! I was somewhat skeptical because it is located in a strip mall but I was pleasantly surprised. I highly recommend trying this place - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I don't like to post negative reviews unless I think they will be beneficial to restaurant and diner. First, the food had a good, not even close to great, flavor. But the meat was all dried out.  Leftovers?  I don't know, but to me, pride in one's product is essential to any business.  They packed the bread with the meat and it was completely soggy when we got home.  mac and cheese was okay.  A little more care and it would have been so much better."}
{"text":"Food is very well prepared, along with friendly service. I especially love the smoked wings, that I continually come back for."}
{"text":"Complete disaster on Memorial Day. There must be 20 people here all waiting for orders and only one poor girl doing the counter, phone and all the tables."}
{"text":"Well, if you've only got 10 minutes and desperately want something that resembles BBQ i guess this might be the place. However, a strong argument can be made that you'd just be better off with a McRib. I got a half rack with frozen fried okra and cole slaw fresh out of the tub. The three sauces I tried were sickly sweet but you'll want sauce 'cause the meat just doesn't bring much to the table.   That's about all I can say about it.  Did I mention they were fast? They're really, really fast. Faster than McDonald's so you might want to consider that in your decision making."}
{"text":"I'm optimistic for the future of Shane's. It is now under new ownership and they really seem to be sincere about making Shane's great. I'll definitely give it another try when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is mediocre at best. You tend to have to wait quite a bit of time in order to place your order. Meanwhile there is a camera placed looking at the registers but no one is looking at how many people are waiting in line. I listened to one of the employees telling a Customer that a plate did not contain have a half pound of meat... It had 8oz on it. That should tell you all you need to know about the waitstaff. But as stated earlier the food is pretty good. The sauce selection is nice. And when the servers are doing their jobs it is served really quick."}
{"text":"We decided at 9:00 a.m. to have a get together. Called and asked if they could help us out. No problem! They had brisket, pulled pork and buns waiting for us when they opened at 11:00 a.m. Food was a hit! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food was okay but the check came and they charged different prices then on the menu.  More money and the server never said that would happen.  I ordered somewhat based on price and ended up with a higher check.   They said new menu's are on order but they put a little sticker on the bottom that said prices subject to change.  I was not impressed with this type of customer service.  They should have told me upfront that it was going to cost more then the menu I ordered off of."}
{"text":"Well, we were sure astonished to find a great rib joint in a mall!   The sampler was more than enough for two people -- everything was good, but especially the chicken.  I like most BBQ, but Shane's reminded us that the stuff we have up our way (Seattle) is pretty lame. Shane's does a classic Southern style BBQ, which is complex and spicy. Like another of the reviewers, I thought the greens were a little on the sweet side.  The staff does a great job of getting the orders out quickly, and keeping the place clean and appealing. If we lived in the Phoenix area, we'd be regulars."}
{"text":"Decent BBQ. Surprised to see they didn't have beef brisket or sausage, but I enjoyed my food. Sweet potato fries are kind of meh, but the ribs were fall of the bone and sauce was pretty good. Not the best barbecue I've had, but I'd eat there again."}
{"text":"This place is great - food amazing - service outstanding - atmosphere fun - I would definitely recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good bbq. But, the baked beans are disgusting. Not sweet at all, have an odd taste. The stew is very good and the half chicken."}
{"text":"Food is great, but there is a woman up front...Toni. She is the rudest human I have ever dealt with. I just wanted to tell the kitchen how great the beef ribs were and she treated me like I was complaining. She was nasty, but the food and other employees were great!"}
{"text":"I cant say enough about this place. The food is absolutely amazing. I go here at least once a week on my lunch break. My favorite is the Big Dad Sandwich. Shanes has many different selections of BBQ sauce as well. Portions are HUGE.I have truly never had a bad meal at this place.  As for the restaurant itself, the interior has a very cozy and Southern feel to it. The management and staff is great! The managers are all very kind and walk around to see if customers needed anything. All in all, Shanes is everything a BBQ place should be and I love bringing my family here. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Past the jimmy John's and Jos bank clothing is the mall down the hill by Ashley's. Shane's is under the second level by tea fusion. I had the sample shack. Grilled chicken with ribs. Chicken was good. I did like the ribs. Coleslaw was ok. Kinda stiff and mayo flavor. The baked? beans were good also. Solid rib alternative for a chain."}
{"text":"The shack potato is awesome. It's sort of a pain to get to on the weekend nights with all of drunken rowdies roaming around, but I still go there regularly."}
{"text":"The lady here is extremely rude. Her name is Tony Stork. She is always rude to her employees and she sets an uncomfortable eating environment for the customers when she is screaming. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"The place is terrible.  Had my first and last lunch there today. Even with a coupon it was not worth it. The soda machine was broken, no diet coke & no other sugar free drinks available. The people  in the store did not really care. The food took 25 minutes to be brought to the table & was only warm. At best it tasted so-so.  I have been in outhouses  that was better than the men's bathroom. The only people that should go there are State Heath Dept officials to close it down"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. Great food and even better service. I haven't found a better spot for ribs in the area... Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Drove over 350 miles for this place! Awesome BBQ! Brought the family from San Diego in vacation.  Ate here about 2 years ago and has been looking forward to coming back. Visited Arizona for two days and ate at Shane's twice, and brought two bottles of sauce with me!  We will definitely miss this place."}
{"text":"For a Yankee who's been living in the South for 13 years now and still couldn't care less about barbeque, Shane's is, nonetheless, a favorite of mine when I'm jonesing for sticky and saucy. OK, so the barbecue is still something I'm not a big fan of - sue me - but their ribs are terrific. Some of the best ribs in town, if I do say so.  Good sides to be had as well. You can't go wrong with the mac n' cheese, and the salad is surprisingly good. Not the usual wilted green and not-so-red tomatoes.   Shane's is a bit pricey, but worth the expense.  Warning: a few steps away is the new Krispy Kreme. Between Shane's and the KK, I'll be fat and diabetic in no time."}
{"text":"On the road from Las Vegas to Tucson. Nice family owned BBQ Resturant. Not hard to get to off the Freeway."}
{"text":"The baby back ribs were really good, but the beef ribs were horrible. Tough and bland. Our server was extremely attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Customer service on the front end does not compensate or make up for it on the back end. Food sitting on a not so warming rack in the back also doesn't cut it. I'm sure there are times when service isn't so bad, but if I am wrong. The two gentleman complaining about service that day, wouldn't have been there at the front counter for all to see! No warming table. I would agree."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to get ribs. Tender and very flavorful. I would definitely suggest you try their food and the staff is friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Visited Shane's for a late lunch this past weekend. It's a small place, located in the strip mall in front of Wal-Mart. You order at the counter, they take your name and give you a glass for your drink, and then they call your name when your order is ready.  I ordered the smothered sandwich and a drink for under $10, with a side of potato salad. The food came out fast, and there was plenty of it for lunch. The potato salad was served in a styrofoam container next to the sandwich, which was packed with plenty of pork and cole slaw. I was a big fan of the cole slaw.  The food was good, but it wasn't great. It's what I'd expect from a strip-mall barbecue place. I didn't taste much smoke. It doesn't taste like authentic Carolina barbecue to me at all. Still, it's plenty of food and a tasty meal with plenty of tangy sauces to choose from. It's on par with other chain-style barbecue restaurants in the area -  not knock-my-socks-off awesome, but solid and tasty.  I recommend this place for families or couples looking for a low-key meal at a decent price. The restaurant is clean, and the service is attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Food was good and good size portions. The ribs were tender and juicy with a great tasting sauce. Good customer service, not too much attention but just enough to feel well attended. Tables were a little sticky and visibly dirty. Prices were average."}
{"text":"Very good for a chain, I mean the Shaniac is magical.. when it comes to pulled pork though, my preference would be Pork on a Fork.."}
{"text":"We have ate here 3 times now ...definitely recommend   the ribs they are fall off the bone good ..prices are cheap compared to a lot of BBQ in the area and the food is great also good for takeout orders ...the chicken is also awesome ..I've changed the rating from 4 to 5 because you cannot find better ribs in the charlotte area I've tried them all and its hard to believe how consistent they are good every time .."}
{"text":"This place is an average chain BBQ place. The location is very convenient and there were a lot of parking even during lunch hour. I had a pulled pork salad and the taste was OK. Having said that, I would recommend another BBQ place about 10 min away called Lancasters."}
{"text":"Over cooked!!! No taste... lots of flies in the dinning room. Just not good. Nice staff but that's the only good thing"}
{"text":"I always get the medium hot boneless wings and they never disappoint; the wings are always juicy and with a lot of flavor. The wings themselves are pretty big and fill me up every time! Whenever I'm around there I always stop by Shanes."}
{"text":"I would never order from this place again. I got a $10 certificate in mail as a new resident to the area. So I figured hey why not try it out. Plus it had great reviews. I call in the order and was told 15 minutes. Get there and go to counter to pay and then waited an additional 35 minutes before seeing people who came in and sat down getting there food already. I ask how much longer and he turns around and reaches to a stack of food (that was there when I walked in) and try's to hand me cold food. If the staff here spent less time having long conversations with there friends in line and focused on those who could be potential regulars the issue of my food getting cold wouldn't be an issue. This establishment should also look into a better To-Go strategy rather than having to-go orders and sit down orders waiting in the same line. Truly disappointed but will stick to going to Sticky Fingers which taste better and is a lot closer. Word to the wise who order to-go from this establishment make sure when walking in the food behind counter is not yours."}
{"text":"They're trying. I think it was the first week so I think they were working out some quirks.  I think they got the atmosphere right.  I think he needs to work a little bit on the sauce. maybe it's just to bland for me. the ribs were good thought."}
{"text":"Good BBQ - I had the chicken.  Choices for sauce on the side.  Yummy sweet potato fries.  Service was pretty quick.  Nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"If you want good down home eating this is the place to be. Laid back and relaxed be prepared to leave a mess. Good food for an affordable price. Sweet tea there is very good. The big daddy sandwich is a must for BBQ lovers"}
{"text":"Best pulled pork sandwich! Always recommend them when people ask for someplace to eat!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ ever? Not even in the top ten.   The boyfriend and I decided to have them for Sunday lunch after going to his sister's family day for work where Shane's catered on Saturday. We were going to dinner with friends right after so didn't eat, only sampled and it was good...good enough for us to try it out the next day. What a mistake that was.   Firstly, they changed their in-store menu but decided not to change it online and got rid of the item I had planned to order. That's just a poor business choice.  Second, on the way out of their parking lot I noticed that they don't have a smoker...soooo it's not REAL BBQ, only roasted pork.  Third, the meat is mush, drowning in whatever sauce they have put on it to mask that it isn't actually smoked. Good BBQ pork doesn't need the be drowned in sauce...you should be able to taste the smoke.  Mac & cheese was identical to KFC but the baked beans were pretty good. Didn't try their ribs so maybe they are okay (but I doubt it because, ya know, no smoker), but we won't be going back to find out.   If you're looking for delicious, REAL BBQ then head down highway 521 just a bit and go to 521 BBQ. (They also have the most amazing ribs ever!)"}
{"text":"Awesome ribs, meat fell right off the bone. Sweet potato fries and steamy hot corn on the cob rounded out a great lunch. Friendly service and it was fast too!"}
{"text":"Shane's has always had delicious wings at a great price. This place blows Buffalo Wild Wings out of the water! We had an issue with our order the fourth or fifth time my wife and I came and the manager, Daniel, was super helpful. Consistently a great experience and awesome environment! Kudos to you, Daniel!"}
{"text":"Shane's Rib Shack  is the best!  Shane's has one of the best Bar-B-Q Sandwiches around.  I'm talking about two big buttery toasted pieces of white bread with a huge pile of  pulled pork stuffed in the middle, make sure to get extra sauce though, because they don't initially put much sauce on the sandwich.  The Bar-B-Q salad is pretty darn good too.  Shane's is a chain and it is more of a fast food joint than a die-hard smoke'em outside Carolina Bar-B-Q place, but still, its inexpensive, fast and good, perfect for a quick filling lunch that will leave you licking your lips and smiling."}
{"text":"Idk why I even bother coming here evertime it's eather wrong order cold food or bert rib but to night bbq was dry and slaw had way to much damn manase"}
{"text":"I love their pulled pork sandwiches.  My boyfriend was impressed with their ribs, which he is rarely impressed with any restaurant's ribs.  Also, they have good sweet tea.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Food is great but awful service experience!  OWNER made me feel like crap for pointing out 2 cash registers may help them... AND 1/2 an hour later when I hadn't rec'd my food yet!  She needs training!"}
{"text":"Total negative! Wouldnt take my groupon. Just lost 4 customers in line... we have our vouchers that is proof of payment its not our fault you dont have your stuff straight! Dont sell a groupon if youre not ready to take them. Used to be a regular now I'm never going back..."}
{"text":"Great place, relaxed atomsphere, well stocked with wet naps. The service can be a little better, overall excellent. The pulled pork and baked beans were the best part of the meal. The ribs themselves don't fall behind too far behind. The only complaint, other then service, the beef brisket was sadly lacking."}
{"text":"I had heard great reviews about this place, so I was excited to visit.  Bzzzt...WRONG!  :/  Pluses:  Generous portions of  meat and friendly staff. Tasty sweet potato fries.  Minuses:  I have NO idea what they use to flavor their meat, but it's gross!  This also includes their BBQ sauces too.    Heads up!  If it is your first time visiting, be prepared to write a tip up front as soon as you pay.  What's up with that?  How do I know what kind of customer service I'll get before, during and after I get through eating my lunch?  Live and learn...but I'll spend my $12.00 somewhere else."}
{"text":"Such good BBQ for such a casual little place.  Friendly staff.  Good for kids.  Nothing in the immediate area comes close.  Another nice thing about Shane's is your companions can get other types of food next door.  Several places right here to choose from if they don't want BBQ."}
{"text":"So in my quest for a new lunch spot, I dragged my co-worker and his wife to Shane's. We were greeted at the counter and the menu was so big, we had to step aside to read it all. We finally were ready to order our lunch!  I opted for the Shack Sampler which comes with: 1/4 rack of ribs, 2 chicken tenders & 1/4 lb. pulled pork with 2 sides. I chose greens and macaroni and cheese. All this was delivered to my table!  The food was pretty darn OK! The ribs were falling off the bone, and the sauce wasn't too terribly candy sweet. The chicken tenders were well seasoned and tossed in a hot wing sauce that wasn't very hot. The pulled pork was moist and tender and covered in the same sauce as the ribs. The greens were meh... they were sweet! Something I'm not used to. I was hoping for something more smoky/salty. The macaroni and cheese was not the kind that \"Big Mama\" used to make. It was tasty, but not homemade.  I was delighted to see that they have Sweet Tea!!! Yay! That was a major plus for them. I wanted to try their peach cobbler so I went back up to the counter to order some. OK, I know some people are going to disagree with me, but I LOVE my cobbler doughy. Here's the catch, the dough has to be tasty. Shane's won on that tip too! I loved that the peaches weren't too terribly sweet, and there was a good amount of dough in the bowl.   I plan on hitting up Shane's again for another \"semi-southern\" fix. It wasn't WONDERFUL it was \"A-OK\". If you want WONDERFUL, you'll have to hit my parent's kitchen in Spring, Texas. In the meantime, hit Shane's for a taste!"}
{"text":"Shane's participated in the Ardrey Kell Athletic Booster Club BBQ for the 2nd year in a row. They were awesome!  We sold pork and chicken plates as well as bulk pounds of BBQ for our biggest fundraiser of the year.  Our customers raved about the food and we received great feedback.  Not only are they a great restaurant, but wonderful community supporters!  Ardrey Kell High School LOVES Shane's!!!"}
{"text":"I got the smoked half chicken and was given a choice of two sides I asked for potato salad and they said they didnt have any so I asked for corn and the order taker had to go to the back to check if they hadany they did so I waited for my food which was to go waited 40 minutes got my food walked back across the street to my job so I could eat before my lunch break was over and I started to eat and my food was cold like they just took it out of the fridge and the chicken tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge for days! It was awful even the corn was cold and my french fries were rock hard! Disappointing....."}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice before and both times it has been very good. Service at the bar/order counter has always been friendly, it's nice to see people at work seeing to enjoy themselves.  We've had the grilled tenders and bbq salad. The bbq sauce is a nice range of sweet, spicy, mustard...deliciousness  The first time we went the food was spot on, the second time our good came out within five min or less so obviously the chicken want freshly cooked....And it showed. The meat was tough But since we had a good experience the first tone we will give it another go I'm sure"}
{"text":"I love that these guys deliver to my workplace! The food is great and they are all super friendly!"}
{"text":"I just tried this place a couple of nights ago and thought the food was good and unique. I was surprised because I wasn't expecting much, but the pulled pork sandwich was awesome and even the fries were great!  One thing I wasn't thrilled about was the prices, which may prevent me from coming here on return trips other than on occasion, because it seems like we can get a meal of what we like to order from a place like Texas Roadhouse for a little less than what we ordered here."}
{"text":"Prior to posting a bad review on YELP, the Yellow Pages and Social Media I am wanted to address Shane's directly. As a customer (former now), I stood in line for about 10 minutes watching other customers be serviced prior to me, while 2 lines where open. As I went to the young male cashier I was told I would have to be serviced by the young lady at the register and he walked off. Now I guess I would not have been so taken aback if there was still not a line of people behind me as well as the notion that there were only minority customers behind me. He left us standing there while the young lady at the second register was still in the process of cashing out her current customers. When he laughed when I asked if he was serious, his comment, \"YES\"!  Prior to my leaving I saw him go stand next to the young ladies register and straighten up some menus. I am sorry we asked the young man to do his job. I guess he did not have a problem cashing out the middle aged white men in front of me , only the minorities like myself and the ones behind me. YOU ARE HORRIBLE SHANES!!   August 26, 2015  Thank you Micheal (Director of Operations) for contacting me this morning to address the encounter that I had on yesterday at the Shane's University Location. I appreciate your willingness to get the facts of yesterday and resolve it quickly. Although I asked for nothing more than training and a renewed effort to improve your customer service you were very kind."}
{"text":"Went to Shane's on Saturday after the touch-a-truck event and orders food originally to eat-in but I asked our order to be changed to go @ 1:15pm.  Waited and the food arrived and we left.  We got home a 20 minutes later, noticed that one of sandwiches is missing...  I tried calling the number on the receipt and all I got was voicemail and not a call back. I tried a number of different times and still no answer. So based just on that, I am giving a poor rating  Feedback on the children's chicken tenders, they are way way to big for a toddler to eat and stringy.  They need to be half the size or a nugget."}
{"text":"The service here is actually incredibly amazing! I'd give that 10 stars if I could.  Ordered and then found out they were out of potatoes, the whole reason I came! They were gracious enough to let me order something else and then comp me a potato in my next visit, who could complain?  Mac and cheese was soggy and terrible, potato salad was good, coleslaw was good.  Husbandlove enjoyed his ribs and bbq chicken.  Will return based on service from all team members again!"}
{"text":"Really good ribs, Mac n cheese, and baked beans. Excellent service from Josh. Definitely recommended over all the other places at Westgate."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst barbecue I've ever had in my life taste like something you get out of a vending machine and microwave it no smoke flavor and then they drowned in their crappy barbecue sauce my stomach was very angry at me the rest of the day people at the counter very rude as well won't give you any explanation for anything very bad at least it wasn't very expensive but will never go back"}
{"text":"Never will go back. Went last night after the Cowboys beat up the Cardinals. Maybe my food was so bad because I had a Blue & Silver jersey on. Don't know. However I first ordered some wings and asked for all flats. I was told they don't have a way to do that. That confused me a little bit...ok...just let me order some brisket and ribs. It is a Rib Shack right? Wrong! Got my food and it was like chewing gum. Don't know how they cooked their food but they need to watch youtube or something. I paid over $24 for some beef chewing gum. Oh well, try it at your own risk. I will never go back.  . So as you can see they have attempted to contact me. To answer your question No I didn't notify anyone. But thanks for letting me know you sold out of brisket before the game. What did you serve and sell me then? Now we really have some issues."}
{"text":"Went to \"Shames\" after giving them chances after chances and every time we went they couldn't follow simple instructions to cook the chicken longer as we would request. The chicken would be missing the skin or parts of it and they just overload it with sauce to cover it up. The employees would have an attitude bc I don't want undercooked chicken and it makes me wonder what they are doing to the food in the back. To top it off the chicken was so salty which makes no sense. We will never go back there or recommend this place to anyone who wants real BBQ."}
{"text":"Good lunch option in the Northlake area. Their bbq is above average but the French fries are just OK."}
{"text":"We ate at Shane's before the Cardinal's game this weekend, and were very impressed. The line was long and the staff looked harried, but they did a very good job of handling the situation. The BBQ was above average for the area (let's face it, we ain't in Kansas City Dorothy)!   I had the sampler platter with two sides and was  impressed with the size of the servings and the quality of the food. The boneless wings were, well boneless wings. But, the ribs were well done with the right amount of BBQ sauce. The best, of course was the BBQ pork which made the whole meal!! I had the medium sauce and left without any heartburn, which means I should have had the hot so I could whine about it all night!   The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but if you are looking for something fairly quick and don't want another burger, Shane's is your place.  We will definitely make Shane's a regular stop when we are in Glendale."}
{"text":"Employees were awesome. Unfortunately the food not so much. This is North Carolina, if you want to have a BBQ place better make sure you know how to cook it.  The beans were ok. Everything else is raccoon food."}
{"text":"The Shaniac burger is advertised heavily when you walk in.  I thought this would be a signature item.  It is a cheeseburger topped with chopped BBQ pork and Cole Slaw.  Three things I like together.  The cole slaw was great, the pork average (a bit dry), and the burger was dry and hard.  The BBQ sauce is great. The service was good.  This is a BBQ joint.  If the pork is dry I am not very likely to return or recommend."}
{"text":"A-Ok hits the nail on the head.  Food was acceptable but nothing near as good as some of the other bbq places I've tried in Charlotte.  Ribs were decent.  Just a hint of smokiness and the kind of preparation that you have to chew off the bone.  They came pre-sauced and there was really no evidence of rub.  Okra was right out of the freezer so nothing special there either.  I suppose this is what you get when you pick a bbq place that's basically located at the mall.  Live & learn..."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of BBQ, but I do love Shane's BBQ sandwiches.  I'm not sure what makes their BBQ so special.  Maybe it's the amount of meat you get.  We usually go there for lunch about once every other week and get the Big Dad sandwich.  The Big Dad is a HUGE mound of shredded pork on two pieces of Texas toast.  The pork shadows the thick toast.  Then you can add whatever sort of BBQ sauce, if any, you want.  Spicy for me, please!  Or hot.  I can't tell the difference between their Spicy and Hot sauce, so I just mix them together.  With the combo I get, I can pick whatever side I want.  I've tried the fries, mac & cheese, and their new fried okra.  All are good, but you get more fries than the others so it can be a better value if you're especially hungry.    Today I tried their chicken fingers because they had a special of 3 chicken fingers, fries, and a drink of only $5.  Score!   For a place whose specialty is BBQ and not chicken fingers/wings, their fingers were amazing.  Each one was thick and meaty.  Then they roll them in your choice of sauce.  I got hot, of course, and it was amazing, too.  Wow.  Such flavorful hot sauce!  Now I'm going to have a tough time deciding between their Big Dad and chicken fingers next time we go...  The theming of Shane's is fun, too, (it's supposed to be like a shack) and the service at this particular location is always top-notch."}
{"text":"I'm not an easy guy to please when it comes to BBQ, but Shane's is my absolute new favorite. I ordered the sampler platter with ribs, chicken tenders and pork, and everything was excellent! The ribs fell off the bone and were so tender!"}
{"text":"The food is real good and close to home.I prefer real smokey meats but give them 4 stars for their quick and friendly service and food that is always hot.  Large side portion of french fries and the beans and Brunswick stew are real good.(portions need to be a tad bigger) Cole slaw is OK. Pulled pork always great and several sauces to choose from."}
{"text":"First time eating from Shane's.  Service exceeded expectations and the food was outstanding.  My wife had the pork salad and I had the lunch special (3 pc tenders). We will be back!"}
{"text":"For fast food this place does BBQ right.  Great salad option with pulled pork and BBQ Chicken"}
{"text":"Oh Shane's how I have missed you!   I used to live in walking distance of the Afton Ridge Shopping center and when the Shane's Rib Shack location opened up there a over a year ago it instantly became a favorite in our household. Not living as closely now I haven't been as frequent a visitor and driving by last week I was extremely disappointed to find out that they have closed recently. Not really sure why as they were always busy (and had decent Yelp reviews!) but I had not given up. A quick Yelp search showed two locations still alive and kicking and I needed to get my fix.   This location is directly across the street from Northlake Mall, luckily not far away. The inside is what I've come to expect, clean yet sort of rustic black and white motif. I ordered the 1lb chopped barbeque chicken (I was rather hungry) and a drink and sat down. Food came out quick enough and I finally got to feast. The chicken is as delicious as I remember. Moist, tangy, just enough spice. There are sauces on the table for you to have your pick of flavors but I personally don't find it necessary on the chicken, it's wonderful as is. There are so many wonderful restaraunts with all sorts of barbeque dishes so it's really hard to pick a \"best,\" but if your speaking strictly chicken, this is near the top of my list. I didn't get a side, but my dish did come with four pieces of Shane's secret weapon, their delicious Texas Toast! That bread is truly wonderful. Soft and light. I know it's just buttered bread, but it's damn near perfect buttered bread. A little tip, some of there sandwiches (like the \"Big Dad\" pulled pork) come on the Texas Toast and some come on a plain bun, but they will always sub out the normal bun for toast if you ask. It can only make your experience better.   This place does not disappoint and I plan to visit again soon."}
{"text":"First time at this location and first time trying their ribs...... at the \"rib\" shack. I bought the combo plate; ribs, pulled pork, chicken strips with hush pups and sweet potato fries. It took 25 minutes for the food to reach the table, we were given a coupon for 10 free wings for tbe delay without even saying a word.... cool. The fries were room temperature but tasty nonetheless. Sadly they were the best thing on the plate. The pulled pork had its usual good taste but there was a lot of fat.... chunks. The tenders were cooked well but were salty beyond belief. Last up, the ribs..... probably  the worst ribs I have evere had. These were not \"fall off the bone\" , they were \"slide off the bone\". In a word... slimy. I have had boiled ribs that beat these. I could not detect a note of smoke flavor. I am confident that this must not be typical to to place, there is no way it could be. I made my way throgh one bone and quit while I was ahead. I will try their ribs again but I did leave that wing coupon on the table.... I did not want to push my luck even with free wings."}
{"text":"Me and my friend came for lunch one day and I was really shocked on how great their bb is. I had the pulled prok sandwich and fries, so good. By niece was with me and to nor surprise she really enjoyed the creamy mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never checked-in here before!  We've been coming here for a few years now.  Really like their ribs.  My husband enjoys the sampler with the pulled pork and we both always double up on fried okra.  We're from the south and you just don't see it very often here!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE TO EAT... Mac and cheese is great, i always get the Big Daddy Sandwich, and for christ sakes they don't call it a rib shack for nothin'... get a rack of ribs!! get them with no sauce though, the tables have about 5 different types of sauce."}
{"text":"Well, let start by saying the food is ok. The service is horrible. I had to chase down the servers three times because they forgot stuff on my order. First, they forgot to bring a smothered sandwich that I had ordered. Second they forgot my Texas toast with the shack platter. Then the girl that initially had brought the first half of the order was trying to ovoid me when all I wanted to ask was to bring me my toast. I'm sorry but I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Shane's has very good southern style BBQ.  They're from Georgia but I always attribute this type of BBQ to the Carolinas.  I prefer southern BBQ over Texas BBQ.  We had the \"Big Dad\" which is a pulled pork sandwich with toasted bread rather than a bun.  We also had the \"Smothered Pork\" which is basically the same as the \"Big Dad\" but it's served on a bun and is topped off with cole slaw.    A lot of food for the money. Great service. We'll be back.  FYI - grab extra napkins."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, I honestly thought the food was going to be sub-par. Blew me away!!! Nothing we had was less than fantastic!!! Food came really fast, excellent service, and top notch food!!!"}
{"text":"I usually enjoy Shane's. Today I wanted some wings which I order through yelp, it said would be ready at 7:44 , I come in at 7:30  pick them up (they were ready). I was so hungry I decided to eat them in the car, they were cold, dry and hard. They tasted like old over cooked wings with a extra sauce to cover its dryness.So disappointed ."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Shane's and finally decided to try it! I tried the sampler and everything was hot and fresh with a great flavor. I added more sauce to my pulled pork but all in all it was great!! I only have 4 stars because I did To Go and didn't get to experience dinning in. Next time I go I will defintely dine in !! Yummmy"}
{"text":"I ordered the lemon pepper and teriyaki wings. The lemon pepper wings were very dry. They tasted like they were recorded then doused with the seasoning. The teriyaki wings were fresher  and not so dry."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Food is always on point and you get really large portions. Get the smothered pork sandwich!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The bbq actually resembles real meat! If you've ever been to city bbq it's like that, just slightly cheaper (in price and quality).   Blown away by the shack potato, I get mine with pork on top. SO. GOOD.   Their bbq pork is great, hush puppies are good and the atmosphere is nice.  I also appreciate that they have on sports channels vs political ones. Very inviting and friendly staff, I'd recommend it to anyone!  (Why not 5 stars? Well they use fake cheese on the potato and I'm like, shredded or gtfo. Also just kind of skimpy on portions sometimes.)"}
{"text":"Saw and Groupon and they show no prices on their website so went to Yelp.  After what the majority has said and especially about problems with the Groupon - no thanks - we'll go elsewhere.  Thanks everybody for your honest comments!"}
{"text":"My family and I used to enjoy coming here for a fast, hot and simple dinner solution.  On our last two visits, the food was lukewarm at best, not as flavorful and sloppily presented.  Another thing at this location is there always seem to be a lack of managerial presence when we're here. Lots of 20/younger somethings  trying to run the show. We may check out some of the other locations when we happen to be in their neck of the woods."}
{"text":"It was decent. Sauce was bland. It may have good at one point but they are corporate now and can not mass produce good southern cooking."}
{"text":"Tonight November 3 I had one of the worst experiences that I have ever had at any establishment. I live down the street so I wanted to call my order in around 915 and a lady answered and put me on hold which was fine initially. I was on hold so long I decided to go ahead and get ready to head to the restaurant I had time to get dressed get in my car and drive all the way there still on hold. I walked in and three girls were standing at all three cash registers talking to each other,  I proceeded to let them know that I had been on hold for 20 minutes at that point I received no apologies in a very smart tone one asked if I was ready to order. I couldn't believe how nonchalant and unapologetic all three of these women were! Worst experience ever, I do not plan on ever going back. There are only a few restaurants that are good enough to deal with bad service and Shane's is not one."}
{"text":"The service was very good. Inside was also kept clean.   I'll start by saying the bbq mustard sauce was spectacular. I ordered the current advertised special (pictured). It was good, but a pricey for what it was ($14). The French fries were very fresh.   I think a person who came here for the ribs would have a better experience as there are no real options for fast food ribs. For a burger...there are better options that cost less."}
{"text":"I had the 9 dollar beer battered cod with fries and coleslaw. The fish looked like the same kind you get from the frozen section at the grocery store. Also the fish was covered with grease. The fries weren't very good either and the coleslaw did not taste good at all. My fiance had the big dad and coincidentally that is what she calls me. The big dad and i'm not talking about me consisted of bread (texas toast) and pork with no sauce. She said it tasted terrible. It seems as though there is no great restaurants in the Phoenix area and that is sad. Oh yea our total bill was 22 dollars."}
{"text":"Came here with my buddy after a long long day at the track. After a day with nothing but crappy sandwiches, red bulls, and adrenalin this place just hits the spot.  I had the Shack Sampler which is 10.99 and WOW is it well worth it. Sampler comes with: 1/4 Rack or ribs - Very tender, sauce could have been a little sweeter but that could be just the way i like my sauces 2 jumbo tenders - fried chicken tenders, i ordered them mild and they didnt have much heat to them. one was very dry but the other was perfect. both were pretty big and meaty 1/4 pound of pulled pork - wow just WOW. most places the 'pulled' pork is nothing more then a block of meat that's been separated a bit to give the look that it's been pulled, not here it's actual mound of pulled pork the only clump you'll see are so small they're not worth mentioning and it's all tender as well. Just personal preference but i would have enjoyed it more of the sauce was a bit sweeter or smokier   Sides Sampler came with two sides  Brunswick Stew - tomato based stew with some veggies, also contains a generous amount of pulled pork (every spoon or fork full contains more pork then veggies) and bbq sauce. this was the best side i've ever had with a meal. i wish i ordered a large so i could have poured it over everything Fries - They're fries!! salted the way i like 'em  I wish there were more places like this in the south west..."}
{"text":"Interesting old design! The workers are very friendly, seems like a family owned joint which is so much better! It's clean and the food is very BBQY and good! Just sucks because it's such small portions so if you decide to just get a sandwich I would get another one to really full you up. TVs are old and disgusting it's 2015! Get some new ones for god sakes!!"}
{"text":"I liked this restaurant. I asked a lot of questions about the ingrediants and the girl was super nice ! They made my food to order because of my dietary restrictions. Basically ,I'm a pain in the ass and they accommodated me !I like the original BBQ sauce the best ...honey mustard was good too ! Great family place and large servings !"}
{"text":"Stopped by Shanes and ordered a togo meal.  Got a big dad sandwich and mac n cheese.    The Big Dad is a good size with lots of meat on some texas toast.  I would have liked some pickles or slaw or something to go with it rather than just meat and bread.  My sauce also was only half filled and it needed a lot more.  The toast also needed to be toasted more.  The mac n cheese was average.    Decent but not sure I'd come back or recommend it after my initial impression."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of BBQ - especially given the fact that I don't eat pork or beef.  Most BBQ chicken I have found in BBQ restaurants  does not really thrill me.  So when I found out our company ordered a catered lunch from Shane's I was a bit dubious.  However, I must say that I was very pleasantly suprised. The BBQ chicken was delish. It was juicy, tender, and flavorful. The sides that were ordered included green beans and peach cobbler.  The sides were pretty good... not quite as good as home-made, but better than expected.  Way to go Shanes!"}
{"text":"Just ordered 4 plates via DoorDash and this has to be some sick joke. A sixty dollar joke.  The brisket and ribs were in a pathetic state, almost plastic...unchewable and way too salty. The sauce was thing and fries were rubbery.  I've eaten at this location 10-12 times over the years.  I'll be actively discouraging friends from eating here. This was a disgusting display of something a person could barely call food."}
{"text":"I have seen this chain all over the country, but never tried any food until a few days ago in good ole happy valley. The chalkboard special outside caught our attention which was a sandwich, drink and side for 7 bucks. You save about 4 bucks overall on each meal. The very rare (usually spotted in NC) chopped chicken sandwich was my choice. Basically chopped white meat chicken on a bun. You put on your own sauce and away we go. I liked the spicy sauce, which was peppery, but not too hot. The side dishes of mac n cheese and sweet potato fries were about average and the pulled pork got good reviews. If that special is in effect, then this is a great lunch option."}
{"text":"Best Fast food BBQ joint in the country!  love their ribs, chicken tenders, pulled pork and brisket.  sweet tea is legit!  Only thing is the location up on Happy Valley seems to be prepared a little bit better I don\"t know what it is.  (I have been to both locations multiple times)"}
{"text":"Really good food a bit pricey but worth it. Even though they don't personally deliver if you go on GrubHub their delivery service will bring it to you."}
{"text":"Normally, I love going to Shane's.  For some reason, though, they have changed their fries to substandard potatoes.  Bring back the triangular cross-section fries!  Also, the brownies have been downgraded.  BBQ is still great, though."}
{"text":"Went to Shanes last night about 630pm, place was pretty empty there was about 6 people sitting at tables and no one else waiting in line.   I had to wait for the Manger who was on the phone letting a member of staff know it was slow and not to come in.  Once he finished the call I was greeted friendly.  Started to make my order and mentioned the Groupon and was promptly told that the terms and conditions of the Groupon state no holidays.  It was Valentines day. I asked when that became a holiday as the financial institutions and government employees all had to work.  The Manager said Shanes sees this as a holiday as its on their calendar. To that I had a highlighted Groupon conditions thrust in my face.    Well their terms and conditions state cannot be used on holidays.   So I said it just says holidays and I asked again when did Valentines day become a holiday everyone had to work today.  I cannot believe I was not the first this manager had to explain this today as he was clearly frustrated and replied with even less tact than before.  Shanes see this as a holiday as it is on our calendar again thrusting the terms and conditions at me.  No apology, no tact, just plain we dont want your business attitude.  If any company hides behind terms and conditions rather than customer service that's a bad sign right there.   At this point I said maybe Shanes should list the days it considers holidays on the terms and conditions so the rest of us understand.    Seriously, my calendar lists St Patricks day, Bastile Day, Ramadan, Mexican Independence day, Kwanzaa, Passover, Channukah, Grandparents day there is always something listed on a calendar, not all are classified as 'holidays'.     Guess that's why your EMPTY on this holiday dinner hour here is another Yelp regular you have lost."}
{"text":"Thought we'd check out Shane's today for lunch.  Sorely disappointed.  Ordered the Sampler to share, and specifically ordered no sauce on the meat.  No problem says the order taker.   Order arrives and low and behold the ribs and pulled pork are covered in sauce.  When I explained to the server/mgr about the error I was told that ALL of their meats come sauced, except the fried  chicken tenders, they belatedly came with Ranch dressing.  Why weren't we told that when we ordered.  It was a simple request.  No Sauce please.  Geez.  The ribs, pulled pork and BBQ beans were sickly sweet and barely warm.  The chicken tenders while hot were as dry as a normal summer day in Phoenix.  The table sauces didn't help improve them at all.    Here's what I  know about BBQ.   A BBQ joint should smell like smoking meat, it didn't. Sauce shouldn't overpower the flavor of the Que, it did.    Sorry but I'd rather sit out in the 110+ degree heat at 95th Ave and Peoria where JJ's Louisiana BBQ parks his smoker and get my BBQ,  than return here."}
{"text":"This is our family's favorite BBQ place. Their prices are really reasonable. The portions are huge. The sample platter is big enough for two people to share but the food is so good you won't want to share! Make sure to try their fried okra - it's wonnnderful!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The menu has great variety and so far everything I've tasted has been great! The only downfall is the longer waits and not enough locations! But this ones close to home and is in a busy area but so worth it! (: The staff is always friendly and helpful which makes the experience easy going!"}
{"text":"The employees at this Restaurant love their company! They are the happiest people I have  ever encountered at a Restaurant. In addition, their ribs are amazing! I love this place! I have been back several times!"}
{"text":"If the sign on your door says \"Chicken Any Way\" it does not behoove you to serve mediocre chicken.  I know, I know. It's called Shane's RIB Shack. But it was on the dang door and makes up a large portion of their menu. I got the 3 piece buffalo chicken with Hot sauce. I can not imagine how they have two sauces less hot unless one of them is mayonnaise or something.  I opted to swap out my fries for greens. Granted it is a matter of preference but all the delicious vinegar and pepper I find in my favorite greens is replaced with meat flavor and sweetness If that is your style, then go for it, but I was left wanting.  Theoretically, I could go back and try their BBQ but their prices aren't particularly cheap and, despite the best attempts of the extremely friendly hostess, the experience I had isn't going to woo me away from my more drool-inducing BBQ haunts."}
{"text":"If you want fast, convenient and yummy BBQ then Shane's is a great option! First, it is very conveniently located in the Shops at Happy Valley Towne Center so if you live up here - you are always there because that's where everything is!  (Yes I know Town looks weird with an 'e' on the end but you can take that up with the mall owners).  ANYWAY,  Shane's has come to be a family favorite to be sure.  We love the chicken tenders and mac-n-cheese - DD get's that every time.  I like the tenders, the BIG DAD is my favorite sandwich and the baked beans are my favorite side. DH likes the sampler and the cheeseburger!  Also- MR. PIBB!!!  :)  We did not like the fish and chips :(  Oh.. but their mobile marketing is great - good coupons every couple of weeks and you can earn a free sandwich for every so many return visits when you register at the counter!  The staff is great - really friendly and although it's not tableside service per se, it qualifies enough for me to say they have \"waiter\" service."}
{"text":"Chicken was so juicy and the BBQ ribs were tender and delicious!    Their BBQ sauce is excellent!  Glad we tried it and we will be back!"}
{"text":"The best bbq that a chain will do. The lunch specials are awesome. The pricing is a little crazy........"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The sampler platter is the way to go to get a taste of everything. I've been there several times and haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty good bbq. Very friendly service. We both got the pork bbq on Texas toast. I would definitely recommend it. It had a ton of meat, and the toast was buttery goodness."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Look for the daily special. Wife and son  love this place..It is also close to a ton of options in case someone wants something diffrent."}
{"text":"The best bbq place I have ever been to, better than 521 or any other restaurant. I love their wraps and also the sampler. Great sweet tea, and awesome service. I also like that they offer many sauces that are not spicy!"}
{"text":"My husband, (ironically) Shane, and I thought it might be fun to visit this place. It's a chain so our expectations weren't high.   He and I ordered the chopped chicken plate with potato salad and the mac and cheese.   The potato salad was the high point of the meal. I really enjoyed WHATEVER they put it it, I wanted to order another side of it.   The mac and cheese was a bit bland, I had to add a LOT of salt to make it acceptable.   The chicken was nothing spectacular.   In additional to regular BBQ sauce, they also have \"Spicy\" \"Hot\" and \"Mustard BBQ\" ... not sure what the difference between spicy and hot are?? The Mustard BBQ sauce was seriously awful. I nearly spit it out.   Overall it wasn't the WORST lunch we've had, but I don't think we are going to seek this place out again."}
{"text":"We went here for the wings. I must say the smoked wings were amazing. They taste wood grilled & smoked to perfection. The fried wings were not good at all. We like our wings fried hard (like Wing stop) and well done. These were big & wet...meaning they didn't seem done. Even the inside was a little pink. We will definitely be back for the smoked wings...but I'd advise you pass on the other wings.."}
{"text":"Eat here at least 3 times a week! They have amazing food specials every day of the week and the price is great. Friendly workers who are quick and efficient."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here and the food is great!!! My favorite is the big dad sandwich. It's BBQ on Texas Toast. You get one side with it. So far I've tried the fries and okra. Both are really good, but the okra is my favorite. If you like peach cobbler you HAVE to order some!!! It's sooooooooo good!!!!!! The inside of the restaurant is super cute. You order your food at the counter, and then they bring the food out to you. The employees are extremely nice and they come around to check on you and clear your plates when you are finished."}
{"text":"Good food, other than the sweet potato fries. I only take the time out of my day to write this review because paying $1 extra for soggy, limp, possibly microwaved fries, is laughable. Figure it out."}
{"text":"If you are looking for beef ribs, not the place...but their wings are great & the cobbler is awesome. The service is friendly."}
{"text":"Very nice strip mall type restaurant. This is a franchise restaurant but has very good food. I have been here twice and both times like it. I simply love BBQ and could quite possibly be my favorite food so I have tried a lot of BBQ places. Not my favorite but really good. Meat has a like smoke flavor and is moist. Slaw doesn't taste homemade more line something you would get from a grocery store. Sauce is really good too.  This place is well worth a try!"}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here in the past few years. I still feel that the food is really tasty and the brisket flavor is awesome. I will also admit that I have a hard time giving a place 4 or 5 stars when they charge you $0.39 for a slice of white bread. I obviously paid it as you will see on the receipt but I find it tacky to charge for a slice of extra bread especially after spending a fair amount on quick dining food. I was in disbelief and asked the clerk and she snickered and said \"we don't make the rules.\" I'm guessing I'm not the only one inquire about this $0.39 policy."}
{"text":"Went here a few months ago with my friend for our tri-monthly \"Man Night\". Overall a good experience, but had a couple takeaways.  + Service is very good. + Portions are monstrous.  - Food tastes \"funky.\" We ordered wings and pulled pork, and both my friend and I commented that the taste was \"off\". I wish I could put my finger on this, but I guess I'm not a high enough level taste connoisseur to be able to distinguish this feature. The only thing I was able to point out was that the fries were so bland,   At the end of our meal my friend and I summarized our experience with a shrug. There wasn't anything particularly wrong with our meal, but it definitely wasn't great."}
{"text":"Had the sampler platter and the food was quite good.  Prices were a bit high considering it's a \"look-up\" and the staff didn't seem the most thrilled to be working there."}
{"text":"First time at Shane's.  We had great service, our waitress was polite, fun and explained anything we asked about.   The portions are huge, we took leftovers home and had enough for 2-3 more servings at home.   The food was very good, the meat fell off the ribs, so amazing.  I like that the ribs weren't drenched in sauce, just enough and if you wanted more they have several bottles of sauce to use sitting on your table.  the mac n' cheese was ok, kinda reminded me of KFC, just not enough of a cheese consistency for us.   I wouldn't call it fast food, it's above that we thought.  Their prices vary , we didn't think they were outrageous.  Honestly, you could order one plate, pick it up and share it between 2 people making it really inexpensive.  I didn't give it 5 stars because their bathrooms were disgusting and need a deep cleaning and then ongoing cleaning/spot cleaning a few times a day.   All in all, we will go back just for the food."}
{"text":"In regards to ordering burgers, and customer service, I was sorely disappointed in both. We have previously been in here when it just opened, and was really excited about the young ladies running the counter, as well as the food which by the way I got a burger medium rare. The fact that it's a quick bite and you can order a beer along with was definitely a plus. That being said, we walked in today and the young ladies at the counter where okay, until I ordered a burger that was medium rare and they mentioned that they were not able to make it that way, they could only do it medium or medium well. There was no way I was going to eat a burger like that so I ask for the manager, and the manager said that they were not allowed to do medium rare Burger. I cry BS on that. There are many restaurants within that area, and everybody from bowl and Tavern, Saddle Ranch, whiskey rose, all make a medium-rare burger with no issues. The minute she started giving me some ridiculous explanation as to why they could not kick out a medium rare Burger, I walked away and ended up going to Bar Louie which was phenomenal! See my Yelp review on that! I will not be going back to Shane's Rib Shack, and less I'm 100% sure I only wants the hot wings or ribs, and I am sure that before I order I'm going to have a conversation with a manager to ensure that I get great service, and great food. Whoever was the manager today, made them lose Revenue that I spent somewhere else. Not a very good manager at all.... Shame lol"}
{"text":"Hell yeah. I've eaten at Shane's every Tuesday since I've been working in the area (since September 09). TENDER TUESDAY FTW. Tenders, a side, and a drink for $7.. just recently raised from $6.50. Seriously just awesome chicken tenders.. nearly on par with Rock N Roll fingers in Tempe. I used to get mine tossed in Teriyaki sauce but now I just get them plain. They also offer grilled tenders which I may switch to in the near future. The side of fries is obscene. I have trouble with self control when it comes to eating and would always attempt to finish all of the fries and tenders which nearly always resulted in hurt. I have switched to the green beans which are both delicious and healthy."}
{"text":"OMG!!! ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!! Kate is AMAZING even though she was rushing around cleaning off tables for incoming guests she was very attentive to my two sons who ended up covers in Shane's delicious BBQ sauce.... ahhh and the peach cobbler ...TO DIE FOR!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, especially considering that it's a fast food joint at a hockey rink."}
{"text":"Gluten free menu and very GF friendly! Came in one time and the waitress accidentally put toast on my plate. The only tip off she had about me being celiac is that I said to please leave the bread off. She came over and asked if celiac was the reason for asking for no bread. When I said yes, she apologized and explained that she had put the bread on my plate. She went into the kitchen and they remade my plate after they washed their hands and changed their gloves. That kind of understanding and care is hard to find! They have my vote for GF restaurant of the year."}
{"text":"Was passing by this location on my way to Jersey like subs.. when I saw this beautiful advertisement for a cowboy burger on the door. I immediately changed my mind and went for the cowboy burger. BEST CHOICE EVER! The cowboy burger is so delicious and succulent and the bacon was cooked perfect. I also love that you have Mr. pibb as a choice instead of Dr. Pepper.  I also really appreciate  the coupons I got. I will definitely be visiting Shanes Rib Shack again. Becoming one of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"Ate there today, a bit of a drive for us but it was worth the trip, first time there so we tried the sampler, ribs were excellent , so was the pulled pork but the chicken tenders were so dry neither of us ate them! We had the sweet potato fries and fried okra, both were very good, everything was served HOT, which we both appreciated! Ice tea was excellent! Texas toast served with it was fresh and tasty! Drawback was plastic cutlery and no honey but if I'm ever over that way again I'm eating there again!!! Or maybe just go for another drive!!"}
{"text":"Well we took some friends there for lunch and I was disappointed! We had been here many times since my first review and it had been good! This time not the case! The pulled pork was so shredded looked like dog food! The fries were cold and many hard! The sweet potatoes were shriveled like they were reheated and cold! I guess the Texas toast was the best on the plate! Even the peach tea had NO peach flavour!!! I know my friends from out of town expected better because they have great BBQ where they live! We won't be going back, on the hunt now for a new BBQ place!"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ especially for fast food. Love the fried okra and the variety of sauces. Better BBQ than you'd expect from a chain.  Always consistent with very clean interior and fantastic sweet tea!"}
{"text":"Really delicious pulled pork - we ate it for a few days straight and loved it every single time.  Moist meat, great sauces.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some chicken & ribs so decided to try this place out. It's okay, not the best but not the worse either.  There's different things to choose from. They have ribs, chicken, wings, sandwiches, burgers, salads, desserts & kids meals.   I got the 2 meat plate ribs & half chicken with fries & green beans it also comes with a piece of toast. The ribs were good & the chicken was good just felt like it needed more sauce but you can add that yourself. The fries were good. 2 people can eat from this, I couldn't finish it.   They had 2 tvs at the end of each corner. There's also a patio outside for you to sit.   There's a loyalty program you can join & earn points for free stuff."}
{"text":"BBQ fast. I like the flavor and enjoy eating there occasionally. I order the pulled pork dinner plate and sweet tea. I feel the food is fast, tastes good, priced fair and consistent.  Great place to go if you want to avoid cooking at home."}
{"text":"First time at Shane's. Arrived at 11:40 on a Thursday and there were a dozen guests plus six in line.   I ordered the Brisket Plate with Mac N Cheese plus Fried Okra and a tea for $17.20. Steep for lunch but not for BBQ.   They have four BBQ sauces plus Carolina vinegar available at the condiment table - nice touch. My meal arrived in 10 minutes but I noticed that the folks behind me in line were served first.   The okra was the the highlight of the meal, unfortunately. It was lightly battered, crisp and hot with an aioli on the side. The Mac was okay. It was cheesy but dry instead of creamy. Perhaps yesterday's batch?    The brisket was the lowlight of the meal. Although there was a lot of beef, it was extremely dry. I'm a brisket snob and judge it by being able to shred it with only a fork. I had to SAW with my knife to get thru it since it was so dry. I only ate half.   The service was non existent. My server, after serving everyone else, literally tossed my plate on my table, which nearly slid off the table. I also never saw her again, so I don't know her name.   Very doubtful I will revisit Shane's again but I like to think the pit master had a bad day. I work 200 yards away so perhaps if I see that the owner reads his reviews and responds, I would return for a redo and improve my rating."}
{"text":"Good food for the price. The ribs are good. They make 4 different kinds of BBQ sauce including a very tangy vinegar based sauce that works real well on pork. I also had the Brunswick stew. If you've never had Brunswick stew it's a southeastern Georgia classic.  I'll go back when I'm in the area and I have run out of my own BBQ in my freezer. The problem with making my own BBQ is that I have trouble finding a restaurant that makes BBQ as good as mine."}
{"text":"Shane's is pretty decent BBQ for a chain. I always get the pulled pork plate; the meat is juicy, portions are generous, side dishes are ok, and the food is delivered quickly.  Really a three stars for the food, but I give it an extra star for going out of their way to identify what is gluten free. The information is greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"I really really avoided going to this place altho I heard a ton of good things.  I don't know why... because it was pretty darn good pork.   One thing tho... it has almost been ruined by being franchised... starting to get a slight pre-made taste/feel to it.  I don't know exactly what a \"pre-made\" taste/feel really tastes or feels like, so don't ask me to define it, but when I go in, I feel like I'm walking into Panda Express or some other chain.  Food and service is still good tho."}
{"text":"Ridiculously over-priced and mediocre food at best."}
{"text":"I tried Shanes after being recommended by a co-worker and I must say i wasnt that impressed. The food is OK, tried botht he chopped chicken and the smoked chicken. The smoked by far was better. The sides are not tasty at all, the fries are even sub-par. The best thing on the menu is ironically the peach cobbler. I know its nice to have something on that side of town, but good food is worth a drive. Its not horrible but just dont go jonesing great BBQ. Service was good."}
{"text":"I travel for work, this place was One of the worst experiences I have had. The place was just over half full....my business partner and I ordered and sat down. There were 2 girls no older than 18 operating the restaurant. We waited for over 45 minutes without an even mention of time, an apology etc. Finally we requested our money back. Looking around the restaurant there must have been 7 tables waiting at least 30 minutes and upset about their food not at their table. I received a snub response about how the kitchen staff is new and backed up. I'm sorry, I don't come to your restaurant with my problems, just my dollars for a meal. This won't happen again. Save yourself an enjoyable evening. The hot dog stand would be a better experience."}
{"text":"Good American food. First time visit and I got the sampler because I didn't know what I should get. You start off by ordering up at the front. The sampler included a small portion of baby back ribs in their sauce. A choice of bbq pork or chicken. Two sides with many options to choose from and two tenders that you can customize with sauces. Not bad for a $16 meal with a drink and the variety that the sampler provides.   Clean and good service. Recommended!"}
{"text":"A great BBQ fix! With large portions of mouth-watering, fall-off-the-bone ribs, succulent pulled pork and side dishes that work oh so well, Shane's Rib Shack is one of the best BBQ places I've been to in quite some time. For a chain, it exceeded my expectations. Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"If I could I would give more than just 5 stars! Prices are decent for what you get, the place is just a tad bit small but other than that Shane's rib shack has got to be so far the best ribs! Very saucy, juicy, but tender as well. The service is very quick, attentive, and super sweet. I recommend this place to everyone including families with kids!"}
{"text":"Uh oh, i'm worried that one of my favorite lunch spots could be in trouble. I usually eat at the Northlake location, but lately I've been disappointed in the long lines at the register. The cashier is also responsible to process phone orders, which holds up the line of people waiting to order.  Not a problem today at the university location. In fact, I about had the place to myself at 1 pm.  I walked in and had to wait for the cashier to come out of the back somewhere. After she took my order, she delivered my chicken tenders to me in just a couple of minutes. The portion size was much smaller than what i'm used to, but still tasty. Are they cutting payroll and serving sizes to save $? Not sure, but the whole time I was there, I didn't see another employee. Good thing they weren't busy."}
{"text":"One of the better barbecue places around. The sauce here isn't as Texas-y as I usually like, but it's still very good, and goes well with the meat.  I've been here a couple times, and I'll stick with the brisket sandwich. The buttery Texas toast was a pleasant surprise - most places stick with a boring cheap hamburger bun, so it was nice to see something different. The meat was tender and flavorful, and the side of mac and cheese was decent as well.  A little out of the way, but definitely worth going back to."}
{"text":"Pulled pork with Cole slaw Sammy is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite, but surely OK.  I just don't like the walk up to a window like in a fast food joint to order, usually not easy to determine just what is what with each offering.  Have had ribs and pulled pork, both of which are at the 4/5 star level.  Portions are reasonable and beverages are refillable.  Condiments are at locations away from the tables and there are a selection of sauces, but nothing notable.  Cleanliness is questionable.  Have only been there for lunch, so more people are passing through, but the worn appearance of the booths and tables along with the not so well lighted interior do not create a crisp, tidy atmosphere.  It is not a classy place or not, but after all, it is a BBQ place.  The counter people are very helpful and nice.  The occasional bus person is also customer friendly asking if you need anything.  Parking is out front of this strip mall location.  We prefer 521 BBQ, but occasionally find ourselves back at Shane's."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, especially the Pulled Pork. My go-to is the \"Big Dad' sandwich with potato salad on the side and extra BBQ sauce. They toast their Texas toast to perfection and serve a generous portion of pulled pork BBQ on it.  One of the great things about Shane's are the regular promotions they run, but even better is that the local franchise owner seems to run their own extra promotions as well! If you sign up for their text notifications you'll get the occasional text alerting you of a great deal (normally one a week at most, not intrusive at all).  Definitely a once a week stop for me if not more!"}
{"text":"Wonderful pork barbeque!  Get the barbeque plate, it comes with 2 sides an Texas toast. They were also giving out samples of their peach cobbler which was also delicious."}
{"text":"It smells better than it tastes. The food just isn't very good, not even the fries. I will go back sometime just because it's so close - and I'd like to give them another try to see if maybe they were just have an off night."}
{"text":"The best rib place in Phoenix! Seriously I've had ribs at many restaurants and have experienced some bad ribs here in AZ. But this place gets it right! Must try! Service is always great and the restaurant always clean. I miss my Chicago ribs, but these guys took me home again. Garlic bread and fries are yummy also. So GO and try them out. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This Shanes really is a nice addition to this area of town.   The staff here is very friendly and really seem to do their best in accommodating everyone that comes in.  As far as the food is concerned. ... it's ok but nothing to write home about.   I do enjoy the chicken tenders, but their mac n cheese is typically not as good as I think it could be.  Bottom line. .. if your looking for a change. .. this might be it."}
{"text":"Best pulled pork around!  The atmosphere isn't anything fancy, but it is fine for what it is.  Prices are a little steep, I like that they did a groupon so I can go more often.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I wish I could leave a zero star rating. Was sat after. 10 minute wait, which wasn't bad for how busy they were. After being sat, we waited for over 25 minutes   Flagged down a server and was told we weren't her table. Waited another 10 minutes then walked out. We watched as people who say after us were already eating. The owner wasn't apologetic or anything.   Sorry, no review of the food."}
{"text":"Ok, the food is ok to pretty good, but you will age in the process of waiting for it.  We ordered a rack of ribs and a half pound of bbq and waited (along with 8 other strangers) for over 40 minutes.  Shouldn't a bbq place have food cooking and prepared all day??  Restaurant at UCity is not very clean, and counter staff was abrupt trying to push customers thru.   I've said it before---pay the difference and go to Jim n Nick's.  The food is always good there, the staff courteous, and the place is clean."}
{"text":"We have had 2 good experiences... THAT CHANGED TONIGHT! when we arrived there was a long line, which was expected, except there was only one order taker. For the next 20 minutes we moved up until we were right behind one couple. Not because they ordered but because everybody directly behind them left because the order taker was taking 20 minutes with the same couple.   THE REAL PROBLEM WAS THE \"OWNER\" I asked to speak with her and at the onset she was rude. I tried to explain that they were losing customers because there was only one order taker.  Her response was a condescending \"well we just don't do that.\"   I won't spend my money at a place where the owner doesn't at the very least listen or show any attention to customers suggestions.  If the owners are that way the staff won't be far behind."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had on west valley. Definitely a place to take people from out of town especially with it being located in west gate."}
{"text":"Had lunch here one day. We both got a large plate and realized later that we could have shared one. Come hungry and enjoy the tasty BBQ."}
{"text":"Ask for plastic gloved and go crazy.  I like the half chicken, the pork, and ribs.  The staff are so upbeat.  When I asked for gloves the waiter was so enthusiastic.  Someone at another table saw what I was doing and he joined in too."}
{"text":"Shane's has always been a go-to for me when we're in the WestGate area.  The Shane's in Chandler at the Casa Paloma closed long, long ago and this is the closest one for me.  Everything is good at Shane's, but I'm particularly fond of the Brunswick stew. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I ordered food to go , employees were polite and helpful , bit pricey,  could have had some more fries but overall I do like their food ."}
{"text":"Visit date 11/24/2017-  this is a small place.  FOOD- I had fried okra, fries and green bean. MAN THAT FRIED OKRA WAS EVERYTHING! The green beans, I was not fan of, they were overly cooked and mushy. The food was fresh cook to order. My husband and the BBQ sandwich, He said It was good BUT it did not fill him up. He ended up having to order another sandwich. The regular size portions are a little small. I had to order another side of okra (plus I liked them lol)   INSIDE- the table is wood and is not that comfortable. They have three small TV on the wall with ESPN or sports games playing. The different flavors off BBQ by the drink station.   EMPLOYEES- they were nice and brought the food to our table and will still check up on you to see if you need anything."}
{"text":"First, I love Shane's Ribshack. So much so that I wanted it to be my first meal after a three month trip in Alaska where there is   1. No Shane's Ribshack   And   2. No Southern BBQ  We literally drove 30 minutes just to savor some of the smoked wings at a newer location only to to be told they were out of wings. After telling the cashier this, she laughed and said \"sorry, there's nothing I can do.\" It sounded like to me \"we're not making anymore.\" How can you be out of smoked wings?! There was no sign or anything. She just stood there. Didn't offer us anything else or make a suggestion or anything.   Not cool. We were more upset by her nonchalant attitude than anything. Not sure if we will be back to that location. Not a good first impression."}
{"text":"For lunch yesterday, I got a craving for BBQ.  I did not really feel like fighting the crowds at Mac's Speed Shop today, no matter how good the 'cue is.  After doing some research, I found Shane's Rib Shack, which is fairly close to my office.  Shane's Rib Shack is a chain BBQ restaurant, with restaurants in 14 states, primarily in the southeastern United States.  There are 2 Charlotte-area locations: near Northlake Mall and the University area.  I went to the one in the University area.  When I arrive, I find that it's located in a \"shopping center\".  It just so happens that the lunch special was their smothered pork sandwich with a side, so that is what I ordered.  For my side, I chose Brunswick stew.  I place my order and grab a seat.  The first thing I notice is that they have multiple sauces available.  Naturally, I had to give them a shot.  All of the sauces were primarily tomato-based.  The original sauce had a bold but not overpowering flavor.  I could taste hints of mustard and chili powder in the sauce.  The hot sauce had essentially the same flavor profiles as the original, but it also had some back heat.  My favorite out of the three was the spicy sauce.  It contained the bold flavors of the original sauce and the back heat of the hot sauce while adding a level of complexity through what tasted like ground peppercorns.  The sauces were not all that complicated and overwhelming, but they were solid.  And sometimes solid is just what the doctor ordered.  Less than five minutes after ordering (and literally right after finishing the sauce tasting), my meal comes out.  The first thing I notice is the size of the sandwich -- it's significantly larger than I expected.  This is a plus!  I was expecting a sandwich on a normal-sized bun.  Instead, the bun was extra large (about 25% larger than a normal sandwich bun) and piled high with plenty of pork (along with some slaw).  The pork on the sandwich was pulled, with the pieces varying in size.  There was a nice mixture of pork and \"outside brown\".  There was not a lot of smoke flavor in the meat, which was not a surprise.  However, the pork was very moist, and I could actually taste the meat.  I went ahead and added the spicy sauce to the sandwich and ate away.  All in all, a solid sandwich.  After finishing off the sandwich, I moved to the Brunswick stew.  At first glance, this did not resemble anything stew-ish at all.  There were ample amounts of the pulled pork along with the other requisite ingredients that constitute Brunswick stew.  All in all, I found that the taste of this was solid too.  If it was not for the portion size of the sandwich, I probably would say that the portion of the stew was a bit on the small side.  Overall, I would say that Shane's Rib Shack (at least this particular location) is a safe choice when it comes to BBQ.  For most people who may not be as picky about their BBQ, they will absolutely love it  This review is available with pictures at http://www.bigwaynerbbq.com/2011/02/10/review-shanes-rib-shack-charlotte-nc/."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that the staff is very nice and the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated.  Now the real review, The food is really not good (actually it is really bad).  My Husband and I ordered Chicken Wings, Big Dad, Fries, Fried Okra and Cole Slaw and  were extremely disappoint in the Chicken Wings, Spicy Buffalo Sauce, The Big Dad and the BBQ Sauce in other words just about everything.  I would not recommend this place to anyone as this is the south and BBQ is something that is taken serious here so go to a real BBQ restaurant it will cost the same and you will be much more satisfied."}
{"text":"To be quite honest, I've never heard of this place until I wandered by it one lazy Saturday. A friend and I went in expecting to see \"ribs\" as the primary dish to get. Man, were we wrong! They have amazing pork BBQ sandwiches. Not the BEST, but pretty close (the top 3 in my book of Phoenix BBQ).  The size of the sandwich is definitely filling. My favorite part is when the sandwich has the coleslaw inside it. I saw that they can also cater events, which is totally awesome! I would love to have the next work event catered by Shane's. It looks like they give you tons of BBQ pork to make sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great service, from the moment we walked in the door until we walked out!!! Loved the fried okra. My husband ordered the ribs and loved them. The wings were also excellent!"}
{"text":"Place was clean and service was ok . Food was not bad but not good . It was just ok . I had high hopes being in Westgate ."}
{"text":"Shane's Rib Shack is my go to place for Lunch. You will spend between $7 - $10 dollars unless you go for the ribs. I have had just about everything on the menu. My favorite is the Beef Brisket Sandwich with the beans and a large drink. These sandwiches are huge and sometimes I can't finish them. Their ribs and chicken fingers along with the Big Dad Pork Sandwich are great as well.   They have all kinds of different barbeque sauces and the staff is friendly and very helpful. They have an outdoor area and just a relaxing place to have a meal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to for \"cookout style\" food. Everything I've had here is great! My favorite is the fried okra. They have awesome customer service and I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Shane's, definitely lived up to expectations. We ordered out and didn't have much of a wait at all. The cashier was friendly and very helpful with the menu, even making suggestions for our side items.  My husband loves Bar b-que and Shane's is pretty close to where we live so we will be regulars! You have to try the peach cobbler, try it with a scoop of ice cream.  We love this place"}
{"text":"So last night, I took the family including the god-daughter to Shane's for a little break and get some grub.  We've been there several times and for quick and cheap BBQ, it's rather good.  This is the first time I've written about my god-daughter, so a little background on her, she weighs maybe 120 soaking wet wearing cement shoes, but can put it away more than anyone I know.  So I get the pulled pork sandwich with a side of macaroni and cheese, my wife gets a dirt pulled pork sandwich (Cole slaw on top) and my god-daughter gets the buffalo wings with french fries.  We had more than enough food.  My sandwich with the original BBQ was great and we like the Macaroni and Cheese there.  This was my wife's first try at a dirty sandwich and didn't notice much in taste, but did acknowledge that the sandwich was more crunch.  My god-daughter thought the buffalo wings were good with the BBQ that gave the little spice a nice tang flavor.  The side of fries was huge, could have easily feed quite a few people with them.  The portions overall are good in size and the service, for ordering at the counter and they bring it to you has always been pleasant, the staff seems to enjoy working there and we have some fun with them on our visits, enough that will keep bringing us back."}
{"text":"Great food, Great service ,and honors it's veteran community! Thank Shane's for an amazing experience while visiting Arizona!"}
{"text":"Came here after purchasing a coupon from Groupon. $10 for $20 worth of food - not a bad deal, so thought about trying it out for the 1st time especially since the hubby and I love bbq. We were definitely not impressed though! I ordered the Smothered Pork sandwhich and the Mr. ordered the Shack Sample with ribs, pork and chicken tenders. My sandwhich was just average. The pork was decent, but the cole slaw smothered on top was way too dry! It was more like cabbage mix than actually slaw. When I think of \"smoothered pork\" I think of the food and sauce just dripping over the bun. Not in this case. My husband's chicken tenders were very meaty, but a bit dry and not very flavorful. Their shack sauce definitely helped to improve the flavor though. The only thing I liked from his plate was the ribs. The baked beans we had as a side were okay. Mac and cheese was disappointing. Like Andrea L. mentioned, tasted like school cafeteria food. Too bland. Fries were decent.   I couldn't believe how packed this place was on a weekday night though. It must be the location convinience, having a theatre and arena nearby. I can't imagine people honestly being there for the food. Save your $ and bbq cravings and go to Fritzi's on Dysart! Even Honey Bears beats this - easy!"}
{"text":"Not worth the price. They were out of baked beans and think the ribs were sitting for a long time-tough like leather. Chicken was overdone and all food was cool or cold. Would have left but had hungry kids."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Enjoyed their pulled pork first time. Second time I got their wings and fell in love! Very delicious. Wing Wednesday is buy 10 get 10 wings."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service... They have a new menu that is easy to ready. Greet Barbecue reminds me of being back home in Texas."}
{"text":"Just the kind of comfort food I was looking for after a long day. I ordered a cheeseburger with some Mac n cheese on the side and thought it was great! It also helped that one of my favorite Rascal Flatts songs was playing when I walked in. I ordered to-go, and the food came out speedy quick and was nice and hot. Plus the cashier and the server were all smiles. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"The lunch group from work eats at Shane's at least every other week.  They really fill you up and we like the many different side dish options.  My family likes to eat at Shane's because the kids can get macaroni and cheese.   The only gripe I have is that the quality of the food is not always consistent.  Sometimes the beef and pork are too fatty or too dry.  The chicken is almost always too dry and chewy."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  I had the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries, and my boyfriend tried the meat sample plate, everything tasted great. I wish we had one close to home!"}
{"text":"The food was not that good and the chicken nachos were gross...they pour that can nacho cheese on some average chips...sprinkle shredded cheese on top not melted...here's the no return ever rule...a huge roach on its back in the bathroom throwing up the peace sign! When we notified the guy at the register, he went to get a broom and dust pan, came back and said \"it's not that big\"  REALLY:("}
{"text":"I love this place!!!   Everything is great from the moment you walk through the door. The people behind the counter are super friendly. The food is awesome!! You get what you pay for, the food is great."}
{"text":"Staff is very unfriendly and food is gross. Received my mashed potatoes all over the side of the container. When I asked the employee to wipe it off before giving it to me she smirked and didn't talk to me again. Then I actually tried the food and I will never be back. Gross stuff."}
{"text":"I love the wings here. Especially the wing special on wednesday. You buy 10 wings and get 10 free. Usually have to split with someone. Wings are larger than normal. The BBQ sauce is good. Personally i like spicy. i think it's hotter than the HOT BBQ sauce.   The BIG DAD sandwich is good too. Also the BBQ chicken sandwich. The regular cheese burger is good as well.  I haven't had anything else on the menu besides what i mentioned.   I like shane's Rib shack !"}
{"text":"Always follow your first mind!  This place is always empty when passing by so my husband and I have never been interested in trying.  A co-worker suggested it and what a disaster.  When I arrived at the peak of the lunch period, 11:45 there were only 2 people dining.  I ordered 2 sampler platters and took a seat.  Later a group came in and placed orders and were seated.  I noticed their orders started coming to their table and reminded the waitress I had been waiting for over a 1/2 hr.  Finally go my food...the ribs were oven baked and nothing special, the chicken fingers were so dry I could hardly chew and swallow and the pulled brisket which I was charged $1 extra for was a pile of mush.  What a joke of an establishment."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect when we went to Shane's Rib Shack, inside is plain with no frills. The food at Shane's Rib Shack was average at best. I  didn't taste like the baby back ribs.  The ribs tasted liked they popped out of a frozen package and baked.  Shane's offers four BBQ sauces plus Carolina vinegar available at the condiment table. My take out order was prepared in  10 minutes. On this visit we order a full slab of baby back ribs and Mac and Cheese.  The Mac was okay. It was cheesy but dry instead of creamy. As for the ribs they weren't so good. The ribs were dry and on the fatty side. The ribs just didn't taste good, I was very disappointed.  Very doubtful I will revisit Shane's again but I like to think the pit master had a bad day."}
{"text":"The food was INCREDABLE! Amazing in quality AND quantity! Definitely worth the money and time! We most certainly will be ordering from them again!!!"}
{"text":"I've given this place three attempts but I cannot in good conscience recommend it.  Drive south a little further and go to 521 BBQ.  The ONLY reason we've come back is that they have a giant baked potato they stuff with BBQ chicken or pork.  The kids and wife seem to enjoy this combination.  HOWEVER, all three times they run out of potatoes and tell us AFTER we've order and are waiting for our food.  The 1st and 3rd time they couldn't complete our order so we were forced to make an alternate for two of our plates.  The 2nd time they had zero potatoes so we all had to order something else.  Hoe the hell does this happen three times in a row, over the course of a year?  Also, we went after church so it was about 1:00pm.  This isn't an obscure time or day of week.  Additionally, if you are aware of this issue (all three times the serves said, \"They always run our of potatoes\") then put in a freaking communication system to tell the good people taking the orders not to sell what they don't have!    We'll never go back again.    The Food:  Chicken Wings - The smokes wings are actually spectacular.  Not fried but smoked perfectly so the meat falls off the bones.  Great flavor and healthier than a fried alternative.  They also use the smaller drumettes so you're not eating gross and humongous hormone infused drumsticks like some other places.  There, I said something nice!  Chicken Tenders - are the 2am AMPM mini-mat gas station variety.  Not sure how they can get the perfective combination of dry and rubbery but 10 points for the accomplishment.    BBQ - If you have out of town guests who want \"Carolina BBQ\" drive to 521 BBQ or go north to Lexington.  My theory is that aside from the smoked wings, they get their food from the Walmart Deli across the parking..."}
{"text":"Shane's is awesome. I usually order the Shack Sampler. It's a WHOLE lot of food. The ribs fall off the bone and their chicken tenders are great. I come here at least twice a month. I've tried all the sauces and haven't been disappointed by any....the fried okra sux tho."}
{"text":"Picked up a take out order the other night for the whole family. Since everyone has different tastes, I think we ended up getting a little bit of everything on the menu. I like that they have a kids menu for take out. The ribs were amazing, as well as the smoked wings and hush puppies. Our order for a family of five was ready to pick up in just 10-15 minutes - just enough time for me to drive there, and the order was ready and on the counter when I arrived. Excellent service both on the phone taking the order and at the counter for pick up, and the food was awesome. Keep it up Shane's - we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Make the BEST ribs I've ever had. Order a full rack with mashed potatoes. You'll be in heaven. This place and Bobby Q's are pretty close in my book with good BBQ. Those are actually the only two places I consider even remotely \"good\" for BBQ. It's harder to find than it should be. Anyway, this is not really a restaurant. It's a order at the counter, they bring your food, and that's it kind of place. Their sweet tea is THE BEST! Their ribs are always fall off the bone tender, meaty, and just the right amount of sauce. Their mashed potatoes are amazing, I don't know how they make them, but Yum! The West Gate location is not good at all. If you want good Shane's you gotta go to this one."}
{"text":"The other location off I-17 & Happy Valley is WAY better. This one was blah. I had ribs, they were ok. They were out of mashed potatoes......If you want better service and better quality go to the other location."}
{"text":"It's a great place to go for casual BBQ which is rare to find. I took my dad n he's a BBQ critic he said it was ok which is a push for him. It's not right off of the smoker but if your craving BBQ it's a quick grab and go fix."}
{"text":"Deep fried wings? Not sure about that. I guess I didn't ask but in a rib place, one would have thought they would have been bar b q'd. The chicken sandwich was dry and pretty tasteless. The slaw was ok. Yeah, I'll try another establishment along the row before going back."}
{"text":"Great chicken 1/2. Didn't like beans toooo sweet. Slaw was ok. They need to cut it better. Bbq sauce average or below average. But the chicken is out of this world yummy. Worth trying out"}
{"text":"I have sampled most of the BBQ in Charlotte, a bit in Lexington, NC and a few places around the country such as Atlanta and Nashville.  That said, I must not be an expert compared to some of the reviews I am seeing because I think Shane's has pretty much the best BBQ and ribs of any place I've tried.  I like mustard or vinegar based (tangier) sauces and Shane's has those in abundance.  They also have free kids meals on Sundays and a military discount that makes them a VERY friendly veteran spot as well.  The BBQ is fresh, smokey, and flavorful and the cole slaw is perfect if you add a dash of the sizzle sauce to it.  Ribs are tender, well-seasoned and plentiful and the Brunswick stew is a must-try - even if it is just a cup.  The peach cobbler is an excellent finish to an outstanding meal.  Catering is an option as well and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"We came 40 min before closing time and it was really busy - on a Wednesday. They are offering a free kids meal with each adult meal purchase from 5-8p which perhaps was why.   The seating on the benches is hard wood with no padding but there is plenty of seating. You pick your seat and they bring your meal to you at your table.   There's a self serve drink area at the back of the restaurant too with coke products and a whole slew of iced teas. The BBQ sauce options are limited but tasty and zingy.   Super pricey for what they have to offer and they take a long time to prepare a \"fresh\" burger (15-20 minutes). The jalapeño cheese sticks are spicy and super delish though and a must try!"}
{"text":"A Shaniac with a maniac!  A friend invited me for lunch since I was in town and he raved about the \"Shaniac\" It 's a cheeseburger topped with BBQ pork and coleslaw on a bun! Wow three of my favorites, supposedly for a limited time only..., its awesome. Now to get one shipped up to my home in Colorado. Wish they delivered, not much room for dinner after that lunch :-). Just do it."}
{"text":"I am not from this area, but upon my return to the Charlotte area I requested my birthday being held Shane's. I especially love the \"sampler\". Well worth the trip for lunch. My sides were fried okra and sweet potato fries. I topped off with a glass of lemonade........mmmmmmmm FANTASTICAL food."}
{"text":"Got the full Rack and half pound of brisket. Ribs were very fatty and mediocre. Cole slaw was pretty bland and not cold. Brisket was best of the lot and it was just fair. Not equal to Dave's BBQ by any means bit an okay fast food rib stop.  The price was high for what you get also"}
{"text":"I really love Shane's rib shack if it was closer to my job I would totally eat here everyday! I'm a big bbq fan. Everytime I stop by Shane's I have the Big Dad; pulled pork sandwich, and the macaroni and cheese. Always perfect."}
{"text":"Had the half chicken which was great. The potato salad and beans also great all for 9.99.  I like the regular sauce not too sweet. Quick and friendly service let me try the potato salad before ordering. Recommend except I didn't care for the Texas toast."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Shane's and it will be our last. I ordered the smoked half chicken with baked beans and macabre and cheese as my sides and my boyfriend got a full slab of ribs with double baked beans. Neither of us ate even half of our food.   To behind the baked beans were completely unseasoned. Other than chopping onions and peppers and throwing them in a pot with canned beans there was no flavor. My macaroni and cheese was so over cooked that there it literally turned to mush when I tried to chew it. The chicken was either smoked for too long or left in the warmer because when chewed it turned into mush. Complete over cooked and disgusting. The ribs tasted more like they were thrown on the grill for coloring and then stuck in the oven.   Even after a night of drinking and coming back to it hotel we both went to bed hungry rather than eating our leftover Shane's BBQ. Suffice it to say we  will not be trying this place ever again. On the plus side the toast was good and our dogs even enjoyed that."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  We shared a sampler plate because the portions are so big...  everything on the menu is perfectly smoked to the right taste.. the sauces are true to the Carolinas...and the peach cobbler is the best in the business..!!   I don't care if you have to run over your own dog to get here.. eat here now..!"}
{"text":"Yummy BBQ. I love the pulled pork sandwich. The ribs are insane. Even their salads are incredible, which is rare for a bbq joint.  Hint: If you only want water, their water cups are the largest I have ever seen and they are free. I appreciate that. I also love that they leave out thickly sliced lemons for my water."}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving 1 star is the customer service. Someone needs to tell the staff what that is. 1st it's not standing behind the counter talking while there is a long line outside the door 2nd it's having 1 register open yet again u have 3 people just standing behind the front counter talking. 2nd I don't think the staff knows how to smile none of them cracked a smile even the manager on duty had a grump face. 3RD AND THE FINAL STRAW after waiting in line for 30+ minutes get to the counter then they tell us our food will take 45 minutes to come out wish they would of told us that before and they still had a line out the door no apology was given by the manager his excuse I just got here ok and your point is!? This is the 2nd time they just don't know how to handle events"}
{"text":"Chose to have lunch here while house hunting in the area. Been to Shane's many times and always a good meal.  We entered around 1220pm and ordered. The counter guy told us it would be a few for extra minutes for the burger to cook and we went to sit down. Cool, not a problem.   I went to use the men's room and it was awful.  Piss all over the floor poop stains in the toilet bowl and on the seat lid and black hair on the toilet and sink.  DISGUSTING. Minimum toilet paper just enough to clean off the seat and maybe 2 wipes. I guess the MOD forgot to check this at opening? And also closing last night? Because they'd only been open less than 90 minutes. Told the wife don't go in the women's room, as it is probably just as bad.    Then the food came out and my smoked wings were hard  and way overdone.  Went to tell the manager and she said they were cooked yesterday. I asked her to look at them and she frowned. I asked \"Would you eat them?\" \"No.\" Why would you serve them?! They are wings. They take all of an hour and half to smoke each day. Really?!  This store has major issues brewing and customers should take note.  If the bathrooms are that bad, how is the kitchen that you cannot see? My stomach is already hurting and I haven't finished the meal. Not a good experience whatsoever."}
{"text":"At here last night, half rack plus fries.  Could not finish it all. Rib sauce was good and ribs were very meaty. There were some bone chips, kind of a big turn off for me.  I presume it happened when rack was cut in half.  Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ!  I've only had their Chopped Pork a couple of times and I find it delicious.  Today I decided to try the Smoked Wings with BBQ Sauce.  They were so good!  Better than the ones I had in SC the other day.  So tender but crispy enough that the skin is not jiggly.  It's a fine line...   I also tried the Peach Cobbler today.  Very yummy and for about $2.00, a great deal.  I even bought another bottle of the $3.49 Honey BBQ sauce for the road.  Service is outstanding and friendly.   Can't complain about Shane's!"}
{"text":"Best peach cobbler ever! Reasonable and give u plenty of food for several servings. The ribs were nice and tender and cooked to perfection, with choices of sauces to use on table. Had a peach tea, mixed with sm lemonade, really good. But the peach cobbler waz the best! You place your order upon arriving, have a seat, when ready they bring it to your table. Very casual atmosphere and decent service. Will go back when in charlotte."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I have come here. Called in an order. And I waited at my job for 5min then went to Walmart for 10min they told me on the phone it would be ready in 15min. I'm still standing here 25 min in waiting for my order. If you come here. Dine in, take out takes way to long unnecessary. I watched customer that came in to eat, get their food first. Definitely not fast food. I won't be coming back here again because it takes my whole hr lunch just to get food!!! This is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Rude staff not friendly.. Ask for two item meal chicken and beef ribs said they can't do that, but chicken and beef ribs are listed in just meat section of menu.. Staff need to learn how to be friendly and give the customer other ideas instead of \"no\""}
{"text":"Efficient, good quality and great prices.  Casual - counter service.  BBQ chicken had a tasty rub and was cooked perfectly.  Need I say more?  4 stars is really good in my book.  5 stars is reserved for the very best and that's almost impossible to do at their prices."}
{"text":"I like Shanes. The food is good, the staff is nice, the price is just right.   Don't get me wrong, it is still fast food BBQ. It does not replace the real stuff.   If you want a good tasting, good sized, bbq plate then check em out."}
{"text":"If your in the Norterra area looking for BBQ, this is an A-OK place to go.  It's quick and cheap as far as BBQ goes.  Their service is very good and they offer a different special each day.  You can't go wrong with their pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw on top.  They BBQ pork the way it should be, slow and low and with out the sauce until your ready to eat it.  It's probably the best thing on their menu! They have good fries and the other sides are average at best.  My son loves their mac~cheese but it's too dried out and over cooked if your eating dinner, so come to eat their mac~cheese for lunch!   I found their beef brisket and ribs to be over cooked if you can imagine that... (how can you over cook ribs?) I've ordered them a couple of different times and found them to be a little dry and chewy.  My son also loves their chicken fingers, but what kid doesn't?     They have different types of BBQ sauce for you to choose from based on your pallet's desire of sweetness, tang-y-ness or ready for some heat.  Next time your near Norterra and looking for BBQ that's quick and cheap, this is a good place to go.  Have a pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw on top, use their hot BBQ sauce, side of fries and a sweet iced tea!"}
{"text":"This place just opened, so I figured to give it a shot. Located just 5 minutes from my house, a great ribs/pork place would be stellar. It was pretty busy for the grand opening, adn we got in line to place our order. The place is very country, but not to the point it looks bad--I actually thought the decor was quite fitting and well done. They also had nice TV's, which is always a good touch. I got the smothered sandwich (pork and cole slaw), and my dad got just pork on Texas Toast.   My food was delicious, easily the best pulled pork I've had--yum! It could have been a little more \"wet\" (if you will), but I just added their original sauce, and it was very good. The cole slaw was very good as well. The fries were also very good, although a bit salty. Service was very good--the training manager from Atlanta was there, and the manager of the store couldn't have been nicer. Thumbs up.  Overall, I'd definitely return. I'd be willing to up the stars to 5 after I see consistency my second visit. Thumbs up for Shane's!"}
{"text":"Lately I've been frequenting Shane's for their $7.99 boneless wings and fries deal. Why? Well, they're the best boneless wings I've had in awhile, putting their neighbor Buffalo Wild Wings to shame. The portions are big, and the parmeson garlic sauce they smother the wings in is addictive. I've tried a few other sauces, and those are excellent as well. Every visit I leave feeling full and satisfied. Well worth the price."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite place to grab a bite, I always get great service and delicious food. Thank you team at rib shack the tenders and wings are awesome !!!!!"}
{"text":"Did I mention great costumer service and great ribs... This is their specialty and I like it :)"}
{"text":"I see a lot of bad reviews of Shane's, but I can not deny that this guy is a fan. For being kind of a quick sit down joint I have always had a good experience. I have no complaints about the food but the service at times could be a little quicker. The decor fits the food and seating fits for a place that provides in and out dining. My daughter and I stopped by while in the area and she ordered the pork sandwich with fries and I got the pork plate with cole slaw and fries. Both of us enjoyed our pork and to me, it is always a solid dish to get here. We both thought the fries were fine but nothing to write home about. My daughter would not try the slaw (shocking , right?) but I thought it was good. We both are big sauce fans and were very happy to see four different barbecue sauces to choose from. Overall, a good food option in westgate area that will not break the bank and provides good food."}
{"text":"Normally I love Shane's and was so happy about this location in Concord. This was my first visit here and I won't be back. The food was ok. However, maybe there should be adult supervision of the younger employees. Listening to them cursing at each other about burnt fries and incorrect orders was not very appealing. Especially considering that the door is a half style swing door and you can clearly hear them. Not a good look at all."}
{"text":"The last time we came we ordered the shack sampler and the bbq pork plates. The food was hot and very good!  The baby back ribs were tender and had a lot of flavor. The pork was just right as well. Dip the pork in one of the sauces and you're in flavor heaven lol ! and I only gave it four stars because it is not much room on the inside if you decide to dine in during a peak time. They are now offering burgers so we will check that out on the next visit."}
{"text":"Loved it. Ribs are awesome. Chicken tenders are nice and crispy not hard crispy. Everything is huge. They have a banana pudding I wants able to tried because I was too full after eating their sampler. Kids are free on Wednesday so that's  another pro. If you like bbq I truly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Brunswick Stew and Baked Beans were great. Nice to see the Brunswick stew on the menu as it seems to be very rare for most BBQ places out here. Ribs on the other hand were VERY dry and not tender at all. More like a 3.5 than a four because of that but otherwise would have been a four or a fiver."}
{"text":"I love BBQ and this place didn't disappoint for a quick pork stop. A friend suggested it and having never heard of the place I wasn't sure what to expect. The service was great, the food was awesome and for the lunch rush, I didn't really have to wait long for my food. I'm really glad to know I have a great BBQ place close by - I had been driving across town!"}
{"text":"Maybe the worst Ribs i have had.  No sauce to speak off    Tasteless and very unacceptable appearance brown and seamed like they where boiled.  Stay away Waste of money"}
{"text":"So I'm pretty bummed to write this review.  I spend a lot of time at Westgate, and go to Shane's pretty often.  I've always felt they were too pricey, but I put up with it. Today I had the worst expirence there.   I ordered a burger, and was told it would take 15 minutes because they're made fresh. Fine. 25 minutes later, nothing.  While other guests who came in after me where served. I finally asked about my food, and asked for a manager. When I informed the \"manager\" (who refused to give her name) that I had been waiting for half an hour she actually pulled out the receipt and said \"No you've only been waiting 25 minutes, not half an hour. and you were told there would be a wait.\" I was shocked!! Definitely some of the worst customer service I've ever recieved. She was incredibly rude and didn't offer as much as a simple apology.   I won't be going back to this location, which is unfortunate as I ate here often."}
{"text":"AMAZING Food, but HORRIBLE customer service. They are always very busy & only have 1 register that works and a very few employees working. It is so ridiculous because it is always so packed the line goes all the way outside. I don't understand if they want customers to keep going and to expand their business they should really try to make things easy & convenient for the customers. The girls working there recently are extremely rude, especially a short Hispanic girl. I went in at 10:55 a.m & they do not open until 11 a.m. She saw me come in she didn't even greet me but told me I had to wait until they open at 11 a.m. I said ok than 2 minutes later a huge family comes in, it still wasn't \"opening time\" and the other worker helps them and I was right in from of the line and she completely ignored me & didn't ask if I was next or needed help, which was extremely rude. The other employee who told me they weren't open yet and I had to wait saw the entire thing happen and didn't tell or correct the co-worker when she helped the other instead of me because I was there first. I have been a loyal customer since they opened up at west gate but due to the horrible customer service they been having lately I will no longer be going to Shanes & do not recommend anyone to go there. Go spend your money somewhere else where they have Good food & Good customer service."}
{"text":"It's ok. Pulled pork was above average but beans and slaw were bland. Ribs were average."}
{"text":"This is some good ole down home BBQ! I had the ribs and the brisket sweetpotato fries and corn i think.... man o man the ribs were smokin good. Falling off the bone and messy as can be. Not to mention they have some really good home made BBQ sauce that'll add a little fire to your face! We liked this place so much we went back a second time while we were working in Charlotte for a couple weeks this spring. The girls at the front were really nice and helpful on what to order. This is a really nice location too, clean and plenty of parking near Shane's (can't say the same for the other restaurants in the plaza."}
{"text":"Shane's is great ! First time here and was very impressed. Great service and great food along with generous portions!  With my plate I received 2 sides and a slice of Texas toast! I have absolutely no complaints with Shane's Rib Shack. I will be returning. Thanks for the wonderful time !"}
{"text":"Love the Big Dad. Tons of moist meat and buttered Texas toast. Their fries are great.  The only thing that prevents me giving it 5 stars are the BBQ sauces. Thankfully they're on the side."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate once here and it was several months ago.  It was a memorable experience because the food was good and I liked the Texas Toast and sides.  For some reason it took about 30 minutes to get our food, despite a few other parties after* us getting their food well before we did.  No big deal, we sat and talked and the dinner ended up being with it.  We came to this facility because some other people had mentioned it was good.  I'm not into ribs or wings at all, but I found the bar-b-que to be satisfactory.  I will go back here again, but there are a ton of food options in this area so it makes it difficult to frequent any spot that is not superb."}
{"text":"The menu is simple. The service is good. The food seems to border between ok and good. The food seems a little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Every once in a while, we remeber this place is a short drive away. My daughter loves the chicken tenders and fries.  I love the half chicken with beans and garlic toast. There is always plenty left over for lunch the next day and it still tastes great. The peach cobbler is also really good."}
{"text":"Went to other BBQ places around the area. This place has a sampler platter good enough for 2 people. When you order Ribs you get more meat than bone not like other places who have it the other way around. It's a little on the expensive side but the portions make up for it. The staff is friendly, tables and booths are cleaned frequently."}
{"text":"One of my favorite takeout places. I love their peach tea and always get chicken with shak sauce! Yum!"}
{"text":"Generic chain \"BBQ\" that really doesn't deserve to be called that.  It's not awful, just fails to be great in any particular way.  Pretty much zero smoke flavor, and they doused it some sort of grease sauce before serving it to us.  BBQ is served as-is, and the eater gets to choose what, if anything, to put on it.  This place is clearly aimed at people who don't really it BBQ.  I kind of figured from all the annoyingly kitschy signs and decorations all over the place."}
{"text":"So this review is written by a Kansan jaded in Phoenix by a lack of Barbecue.  I was on the hunt for a flavorful smoke explosion in my mouth and found myself here.  Firstly the staff:  This one is always a biggie for me.  I opened the door.  The girl at the front counter was very nice, and I asked her what was the best thing on the menu.  Of course, being a place with ribs on it's name, she suggested the ribs.  I did warn her I was a barbecue snob from Kansas. Definite points for the kindness and helpfulness of the staff.  Secondly the decor: Typical Barbecue, the place was decorated in all the raw wood and other goods one might expect of a place like this.  The place was very clean, and coming from an ex food service person, I take cleanliness very importantly.  The decor brought it to a homy perspective.  So thirdly, and arguably the most important:  The food.  So let be be plain, when I order barbecue I expect it to shine above the sides.  It should have a rich smoky flavor, that is complimented by whatever seasonings and injections they put in the meat. I ordered their ribs, and as it comes with two sides, ordered the fried okra and cole slaw as well.  It was suggested that the ribs were delicious. I took it to go, and on getting home, the food was still hot and the okra still crisp.  (The okra was delicious, the breading really did it wonders!) I cut off a couple ribs and bit into them.  Instantly I felt like I was biting into a bit of pork medallion which had been baked in an oven, then slathered with a bit of sauce.  The lack of smoke ring and flavor made it evident how these ribs were made.  I would be shocked if these ribs ever saw the inside of a smoker.  The meat was not bad, despite being a bit bland, but it definitely was not aces.  And thus this barbecue warrior will continue to search.  It may be convenient, but for my dollar, I expect more of a barbecue joint."}
{"text":"texas toast with bbq brisket or bbq pulled pork.. choice of side: mac and cheese. fries. baked beans. fried okra. corn on the cob.     oh the heartburn. oh the delicious heartburn. no jokes, this place is great. they have free wifi, too. my inner nerd was greasy and pleased."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Staff wasn't as great. Told the cashier it was our first time there and it didn't seem like he even cared. Probably won't eat again. Just didn't feel welcome."}
{"text":"Delicious food with good service. Probably the best ribs I've had. The smoked chicken is great, the fried wings are lacking a bit. Over all a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend of mine before a movie.  We sort of wanted ribs but did not want to eat a large meal so we got burgers.  We both thought they were a bit dry.  The staff did not seem cohesive like many of them were new.  We went through several periods of over attentiveness interspersed by a couple of times of forgetting us.  It was an OK venue if in the area but certainly not worth driving to."}
{"text":"Not the greatest place. The barbecue sauces taste bland and the meat tastes like it's package meats."}
{"text":"Not the best option because they do lack a certain quality in their menu options and their food is a bit salty, but the price is right and the meat is fresh.  The barbecue can definitely be improved. Something is off with the sauce. However, the service was positive & helpful. Very patient when you don't know what to order.  Lunch specials found here also!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! I ate dinner here while on vacation and I've since raved about it to family who live in the area (they said they'd definitely be making the 15 min drive to try it). I ordered the beef brisket dinner with potato salad and cole slaw and have not a single complaint!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and my favorite is their smoked half of chicken with 2 sides for $9.99. The chicken is always moist and tender with good smoked flavor and coated with a tangy BBQ sauce. I have tried their coleslaw, baked beans, sweet potato fries( $1 extra) regular fries and all good and fresh.  Of course they have other sides such as mac and cheese and fried okra, sandwiches  such as hand chopped pulled pork and chicken,  smoked chicken salad, bbq ribs, wings and tenders. Peach cobbler and brownies for dessert as well as assorted fountain drinks. Foods come out hot and nicely plated. Various bbq sauces on the table and also bottled for sale. Atmosphere is simple  clean and comfortable. Staff is friendly and attentive.  Prices moderate but portions are large. Your order at the counter and food is brought to your table. If you enjoy bbq, this is a good place to try."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with this place. It truly is like a fast food BBQ joint, but you'll be paying real BBQ prices. I'll likely give it another chance in the future, but won't be expecting much considering this past visit."}
{"text":"Convenient location. Pork barbecue: Tasty. St. Louis ribs. Sauce: Tangy."}
{"text":"My large family came in tonight for dinner. It was very slow for them, so you would think they'd treat one of their only parties as best they can. My grandmothers food got sent back for it being cold, only to come back out the exact same temperature. My Mac n cheese was also cold and tasted like cheese wiz. Very gross. When I told them, they took my barely touched side and didn't offer me a replacement or anything. Everything else was very mediocre. I will not come back, and I recommend you don't either."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to eating at Shane's rib shack after seeing so many good reviews. Waited a good 20+ mins for the food to come out and most of it was cold. I had the burger and my wife had the sampler plate. The burger was decent but did not have much flavor. Fries where mediocre. My wife's ribs, chicken and bread where cold.  The chicken fingers where crisp, hot and delicious.   Now to the actual BBQ sauce.. I'm a huge fan of BBQ! After sitting down I grabbed the tray with there 4 flavors. (Original, honey, spicy, and Carolina mustard) i one by one dabbed the flavors on my finger and was very disappointed.. strong tangy mustard flavor in all of them. They tasted like any ol generic BBQ at most sit down restaurants.   I will most likely not be coming back to Shane's any time soon.   I left a 2 star rating because the staff was very friendly and welcoming.   P.S. if your looking for a wonderful BBQ experience I will recommend Peace And Hominy near down town Belmont about 10-15 mins up the road. They are AMAZING!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't eat here if I was a pot bellied pig coming from a diet center.    The last time I was in town, I got a rack with a mac n cheese and bbq beans for sides.  0-3, that's right, they are batting .000.   The ribs were drier than the Phoenix desert, tougher than an off-road tire and cost more than Paris Hilton's lip waxing.  The mac n cheese was the most bland, pale, crappy side I think I ever had.  The bbq beans tasted like the cooks (ha) poured liquid smoke in the beans and then left them to cook for 20 days.  I wouldn't wipe my a$$ with this place.  And expensive too!!!  Anyone that thinks this is good BBQ has never had good BBQ.  Anyone that thinks this is good food must be of Irish or English decent.  This one just may make it on my all-time haters list.  That's right Cold Stone, you now have company in the shitter.  Ya feel me?"}
{"text":"Pretty consistant BBQ. Staff was great, friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"After we attended the gun show at the stadium, we dropped by here for some lunch.  After browsing the menu, I ordered:  Big Dad Pork Sandwich http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shanes-rib-shack-glendale?select=uaownUdFQGAKZaJG7WVUVA#uaownUdFQGAKZaJG7WVUVA  Cole Slaw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shanes-rib-shack-glendale?select=B_42MFpwDqaXiCEkn1253A#B_42MFpwDqaXiCEkn1253A  While we were waiting for our food, I noticed that there was a some BBQ sauce bottles by the drink station.  I wandered over there and grabbed a bottle of the Spicy and a bottle of the Mustard BBQ sauces.  After a short wait, we got our food and I put a little of the Spicy BBQ sauce on the Sandwich and took a bite.  First of all, the Spicy BBQ sauce is not spicy at all....it's not even mild or medium....there's more spice in regular black pepper.  The next bite I tried the Mustard BBQ sauce...that one had some good flavor to it and added to the meal, so I used it for the remainder of the meal.  The Big Dad comes with Texas Toast as the bread for the Sandwich and it helped hold it together well.  Overall, it was average.  The Cole Slaw I ordered for my side was ok...not as creamy as I prefer, but it was ok.  I'm a fan of BBQ and this place didn't leave me wanting more, thus the average 3 Star rating.  Return Factor - 30%"}
{"text":"So disappointed that Shane's stopped their buy 10 get 10 free wings on Wednesday. This special definitely was the reason we came! When the cashier told us they no longer had that special, we decided to order food anyways. The bone-in wings are good, and the chicken tenders were fine. My daughter had macaroni and cheese, which was not good at all. It looks and tasted like frozen, processed mac and cheese. In fact, none of the sides here are too special. Their barbecue meats are not the best (2 out of 5) and I would much rather go somewhere else for a BBQ pork sandwich. Overall, without the wing specials, I do not think we will come back."}
{"text":"It's not the worst place, it's not the best.  The meats are good.  The bread is often a little soggy from too much butter.  The sides are all sub-par.  I'd probably get the meat to-go and make the rest of the meal myself with sides I picked up at the grocery store."}
{"text":"I ordered a half rack of babyback ribs. It took a bit longer than expected because I went during lunch hour. The ribs was very good and falling of the bone. The price including drinks was about 20 bucks. Overall very good."}
{"text":"So underwhelmed. Food wasn't terrible, I have had worse in the land of BBQ but it's not great"}
{"text":"The place was attractive enough, the smell was good. The place is nice and clean. Doesn't serve alcohol though, oddly, despite the beer signage all over the interior.   The service was quite good though, and the staff was very friendly, so I am torn. The food tasted good but made me a little sick. Price was a little high as well. If not for the Wednesday special I probably would not have eaten here.  Wing special on Wednesdays, and the wings are great. Wish they came with carrot sticks though.  -1 for the slightly-higher-than-they-should-be prices -1 for making me ill  Otherwise, it was pretty good"}
{"text":"Ok I'm giving 4 stars only because I feel like each time we've ate there the employees act like customers just get on their nerves. Just not friend at all! Other than that, the food is amazing & the peach tea is our favorite tea ever:) You definitely can't go wrong with the sampler!!!"}
{"text":"The wonderful smell of delicious bbq hits you as soon as you step into this Northlake restaurant. It is clean and spacious and the staff is attentive and friendly. My coworker and I both had delicious chicken tenders which were also quite filling. I ordered three but two was sufficient. After our tasty lunch, we got in the parking lot and the car wouldn't start. At the same moment an employee from the restaurant was dumping the trash. Mike, the owner came to our rescue. He heard the car \"trying\" to turn over and asked us if we need help. Yes!!!! So needless to say we will be faithful customers."}
{"text":"First time and food was good. Ribs fell off te bone and loved the baked beans."}
{"text":"I tried Shane's today, and enjoyed it a lot.  My husband and I shared the large Sampler, which was 16.99.  It included 3 chicken strips, 4 ribs, pulled pork, Texas Toast, and 2 sides.  I wasn't expecting a lot out of the chicken, but they were surprisingly tasty.  They were all breast meat, crispy, and flavorful.  They offered to toss them in one of about 8 or so sauces, but my dh and I have different taste and ordered sauce on the side.    The ribs were very tender and meaty.  The pulled pork was moist and flavorful, and they gave us a very generous portion.  We tried a number of sauces, and all were tasty.  We enjoyed the potato salad, but I wasn't a big fan of the coleslaw, which seemed overly vinegary.  Our order was brought quickly, and the employees were friendly.  Shane's has an outdoor eating area, but it backs up to W.T. Harris.  I think it would be pretty noisy to eat out there.  All in all, I was very pleased, and we will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I've switched to Shane's as my local BBQ place after eating there couple times.  Their Smothered Pork sandwich is a definite must have.  It is slow-smoked, hand-chopped pork with Shane's secret sauce, piled high on a bun and topped off with their creamy coleslaw.  I always go to BBQ places thinking I will need a lot of extra BBQ sauce, but with this sandwich you really don't.  Very flavorful and very huge.    I recently went in with a coupon for a buy one sandwich get one free (with a purchase of a drink too) and I got two of the Smothered Pork sandwiches.  Had one for dinner, put the other one in a ziplock bag in the fridge.  It was perfect the next day for lunch and I didn't have to even reheat it.  Great deal, great food, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Drive a little further (521 BBQ)  and get really good bar-b-q. not that Shane's is bad, just not top 10."}
{"text":"We ordered take out. Small portions for the price!  Very small eat in area. People were lined to the door waiting, and many left. I'm sure they will be moving to a larger location.  We ordered the chicken BBQ plate and though it was different, the color of the chicken/bbq looked more on the yellow/orange side. We thought immediately that it was going be like a Cajun style.  It wasn't, and it was tasty, but very small portions, even with their Mac and Cheese side.  Texas toast bread was soggy and only partially toasted  Next was the loaded bake potato.  Large potato that was not cooked all the way through.......very hard.  Chicken BBQ topped with cheese. Side of sour cream packet and 1 small 1/4 teaspoon size butter serving on the side. Again, flavorful, and this was about $7.00 for the potato.  Note, this is not as large as the McCalister's potato.  Much smaller.    Another order was the MOM chicken salad sandwich.  Chicken salad was finely chopped up and close to a creamy consistency.  No chunks of chicken.  Only chunks of celery.  Chicken salad was spicy and not to my liking at all and it was on again, another soggy not toasted well Texas toast.  For all three items, and remembering, small portions...........the total bill was about $23.00. I think we will stay with Hillbilly's that serve much larger portions for the price.  Staff was friendly as any new establishment starts up.  Seemed to be a clean place, but can't comment on that because there were many people and could not see the floor or the tables.  We may try it once more after the crowds calm down.  But for now, naaaa, we have had much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"The pulled pork was good and they have great brownies. Service is usually good."}
{"text":"A new BBQ shack offering a variety of different sandwiches, combo plates, ribs, salads wings and more. You can also buy whole \"family sized\" meals and chopped BBQ pork or chicken by the pound.  Apparently by the name, the Ribs must be their specialty, though I opted for the smothered pork sandwich which was chopped pork with slaw on a toasted bun(see pics) Out of the 12 different sides I chose mac and cheese.   I wasn't impressed with the mac and cheese, it was too processed for my liking but I did like the sandwich, the meat had a nice flavor and the slaw was crisp and refreshing.  I would likely return to have that sandwich again.   I'm gonna go with 3 stars for now until I have a chance to try some more items, but all in all it was a good experience,service by friendly staff in a clean industrial shack dining area.   Looks like they have a Happy Vally and Glendale location too."}
{"text":"Their smoked wings are incredible! Can't say enough about them. And they're not flash fried, just smoked. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Place is awesome , great food and awesome service.. Will definitely be back . Very good place to go after a football game"}
{"text":"Food was ok. My ribs certainly did not fall off the bone. Actually they needed to cook longer. Service was great, waitresses are nice. Not for sure if I would return had way better barbecue than this"}
{"text":"There are just not nealy enough rib joints in Phoenix. Im so glad Shanes came along. A little over priced, but I really love their sauce. Love the Caroling Vinegar and love the vinegar peppers.  hmmmm...  very good.  If you get a half a rack special you will be overstuffed with smile..  About 14 to 15 bucks for 2 sides and a half rack. A little too pricy for that meal but still damm good."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, but the food was not good.  The ribs, were fatty, still had the membrane and weren't fork tender.  Mac n Cheese was bland.  The baked beans were tasty, but not spectacular & tasted canned."}
{"text":"Shane's has the best chicken strips in the world.  The portion sizes are huge and always cooked fresh, service is prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"The food was good, well priced and the portions were great.   I went with the pork platter. The pork was good, no complaints there. The best part of the meal however were the hush puppies and the Mac n' Cheese. Delicious!  They have 4 or 5 different BBQ sauces at the table and I liked them all. I actually really enjoyed mixing the Carolina Mustard and the spicy.   Good chain restaurant. I shal be back!"}
{"text":"No complaints about the food - it speaks for itself! However, we went in on a Wednesday night at 8:40, and we were greeted with \"carry out only\" from the cashier. Pretty irritated since that was the only reason we drove to Westgate. If you close at 9, then you close at 9. If it's just carry out after 8:30, then put that on your website, Yelp or your front door."}
{"text":"Very Good Ribs!   Love the sauce.   The fries and texas toast are just kinda meh.   But really, does anyone come here for the sides?   Nope!   It's all about them juicy, tangy, spicy sweet ribs.    Worth coming back to when I visit next.   :)"}
{"text":"Fast food at an outdoor mall is not supposed to be good, so we weren't expecting much.  We got the tenders with a few different sauces on the side.  I don't even know why we bothered with the teriyaki and buffalo sauces--the original bbq sauce is the best!  We were loving Shane's and were bummed we weren't hungrier for more.  Considering all the different chain restaurants we bypassed on our way from Phoenix to Sedona, I'm so glad we took a risk and stopped at Shanes!"}
{"text":"This review is not for the restaurant but for the little stand they had set up outside the jobing.com arena. The boyfriend and I went to jobing.com for a concert the other night and Westgate was packed. There were long lines trailing out the door at every restaurant. We kind of wandered around in a daze of overstimulation for a while and then we walked by Shane's set-up. They were offering chicken or pork sandwiches, mac n cheese, chips and cookies. Perfect!  I ordered the pulled pork, boyfriend had the chicken. We both ordered the mac n cheese. Now, it wasn't cheap. I don't know what it's like inside, but at the stand two sandwiches, two macs and one bottle of water will cost you $20. But we were hungry and I guess we were paying for convenience.  Luckily, the food was really good! Boyfriend did say his chicken was a little dry but my pulled pork was nice and tender. The sauce was flavorful and not too spicy. The mac n cheese was really good. Some reviewers said it was bland - I disagree. I thought it was rich and creamy with ample cheesy flavor.   The food filled us up for a night of rockin' out. I would go back and try sitting inside Shane's next time."}
{"text":"The waitress brought my food to the table with her hair in it, literally just dangling there. When I asked for the manager the response I got was \"well no one here is really a manager, we all just kinda work here.\" Wth!"}
{"text":"Love the tenderness of the ribs. The cost isn't bad at all either. I got my kids to kids meals with chicken tenders and mild buffalo wings that both came with a lot of French fries.  I had the Pick 2 meal with half chicken and 4 ribs meal with the most delicious potatoes salad and creamiest Mac n cheese. All of this for just barely over $20! I took it to go but the waitresses were so friendly. Definitely gonna make this place a family go to tradition often."}
{"text":"Great friendly service.... went to get mom a to go order they are fast at getting the order ready! Mom loved the bbq pork and hush puppies."}
{"text":"Great service here and pretty good BBQ.  But the wings we had here was really good and worth just getting them."}
{"text":"First off, this was my second time at this place and it was worse than the first. The baked beans came out cold, the ribs were tougher than leather and the wings were soggy. We let the server know and she brought us out more soggy wings and apologized for the ribs and said they had a new cook. I'm thinking, they might need another one. All of our food was cold and it was a bad experience overall. Only 3 people in there and I predict this time next year, they will be closed. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Shane's has good wings, but every time we order after I get off at nine at night , they always seem to give us scraps, we get the smoked wings, it's like they just give us the leftovers and when I call to complain they tell us they will take care of it and when we go back they fresh ... if the morning crew or evening crew can get it right why can't they..,. Bad business"}
{"text":"Food was delicious  Cashier messed up our order but management without question corrected it.  Service was great!!!"}
{"text":"So I come here to eat chicken tenders and fries lol Seriously, I love their tender! All white meat, not too much batter and super juicy. I'm not a big fan of the rest of their food but always come back for the tenders"}
{"text":"We arrived about 730 on a Saturday night.  I wanted a potato with Bbq and the potatoes were out.  They were also out of macaroni and cheese.  I ended up ordering chopped chicken with potato salad and fried okra.  The sides were good and the chicken was okay.  It was more like cubed than chopped.  My husband ordered smoked chicken.  It was very dry.  We have eaten at Shane's before in other cities and it was much better."}
{"text":"Not a bad choice for fast BBQ cheap and good flavor, will go back for another BBQ craving if you like tangy BBQ sauce this your place."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special. We come here because it's one of the few places close to our house. It's fast food BBQ. Certainly not the place to come to if you're looking for award winning BBQ. It's a quick fix for a quick meal and it beats the hell out of a McDonalds or a Bojangles."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect from this place. We walked in cold off the street and only chose this place because the place next door was too complicated for us at the time. The ribs were great-fell off the bone. The brisket was also great.   We wouldn't travel here just to eat BBQ, but it's definitely worth it if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant and good food. I ordered the ribs, sweet potato fries, and the \"famous\" peach cobbler they offer. The meat was tender and I love the variety of sauces they offered. The cobbler was ok - nothing special (certainly nothing that blows you away). This place is great for a good bbq fixing."}
{"text":"Decidedly average. Then again just about anything within the \"Westgate Triangle\"  seems to fit that.  E.g you eat there because you are there for some other event.     El Paso bbq schools them on the beans, ribs and sauce and for roughly the same per person cost.  I believe Famous Dave's , least the one in Yuma beats them handily, as does Honey bears, as does RUB bbq etc.    Not that Shane's is  bad it's just there's nothing that stands out.You order on the way in, busy, noisy and hard to wrangle a toddler when the in/ out and ordering location are in the same place.  Food arrives reasonably quickly but plastic utensils and ribs do not mix, let's not even try :)  I want to give it 2.5 because there's just too many places I'd drive for this kind of meal for the same price in nice surroundings.   I miss Shoney's back in Ga , heck I miss most of the rib places I frequented in GA but alas the furthest west they've gotten is New Mexico."}
{"text":"The food here is good. The only negative I have that I have to say is the baked beans. They tasted like a can of pintos opened up with chopped onion mixed in it. The pulled pork sandwich and the BBQ chicken sandwich was so good. Generous portions!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to go with my fiancé. Truly amazing ribs and the beans are great as well. Love the variety of bbq sauces you can pick from. The portions are plentiful and you most likely will need a to-go box. The restaurant is kept pretty clean as well."}
{"text":"Top of my list for one of the best BBQ restaurants in Gastonia. Didn't expect the nice dining experience. Expected more of a fast food environment.   You place your order then go sit and they bring it out like a lot of places are doing now. The BBQ chicken and Brunswick Stew are delicious. My husband had the 1/2 grilled BBQ chicken and it was also very good. There was a continuous line of people to the door ordering the entire time we were there.  Glad we tried Shane's and definitely will be at the top of our dining list."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Shane's with my parents for years and today, for the first time I thought about yelping how yummy it was. I have eaten the boneless and bone in wings, as well as the pulled pork. It's all been pretty delicious! We always will be \"regulars\". Great atmosphere and it's here in Westgate, so it's always a good time to walk around after! Regardless of the time, Shane's is always booming with people in & out of there. Though, it maintains speedy service! Love the food, will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Man i was on break waiting for a fucken burger that took fuck half an hour to be fucken made and it wasn't even cooked all the way the frys were cold i kept seeing the workers just talk and eat food in the back like wtf does this place have a fuck manger shit do ya jobs shit"}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and sweet ... Ticket time stamp was 5:46pm .. Food came 6:15pm .. That's for 2 kid meals during a slow Tuesday evening. Four tables got their food before us; the meals were cold, no flavor, dry chicken tenders, and won't waste my money again. OH, and the men's restroom floor was flooded w overflowing toilet water .. SMH"}
{"text":"The family went last night after visiting North Lake Mall. You order at the counter and they bring you the food. Service was quick. Place was very busy.  I had the half-chicken plate and wife had the pulled pork plate. The plates come with two sides and garlic bread  Children had pork sandwich and chicken fingers. The chicken fingers can be ordered grilled which is healthier than fried  Everyone enjoyed their meals. Portions are good sized.  The BBQ sauces came in three varieties and were tasty. The sweet tea was also good.  Drinks are self-service.  The place was clean and staff was very friendly and helpful  I gave it four stars because the place was much better than average in all aspects and we will return when we are in the area."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and ordered the half smoked chicken plate.  Very good food and service both times.  It's a bit of a drive but worth it."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out since I have yet to find a really good bbq place in my neighborhood since I moved out here. My husband loves bbq. This was not the place to go too. The waitresses were not very happy about us coming in to eat and did not want to explain menu options to us. When we got our food we realized we had over ordered because we were not told portion sizes when asking. Our daughter got a load of food that we would have never gotten if we would have known. Our fries were cold. The sandwiches were good but that was about the only thing good at this location. Not sure if I would go back or not."}
{"text":"Yuck.   I've been dragged here a few times, food is always terrible. Why is everything always sticky here? I've tried the big dad and the chicken tenders, both really gross. Chicken is really chewy and the meat for the big dad sandwich is like, I don't even know. It seems like it has been stewing in a crock pot all day and then slopped onto your sandwich. Really gross meat. The sauces can't help the horrible texture. Unfortunately this is one of the only places that sell fried okra.   The service seems to have dropped off the map too. Every time I order a side of ranch, I never get it and always have to ask for it. Every time. I'm shocked at how many good reviews this place has, must be friends of the owner?   If you want some real BBQ, try pork on a fork just down the road. Blows this place (and pretty much every other place for that matter) away."}
{"text":"Shane my man you have a lot to learn about bbq. I walked in with high expectations to leave very disappointed. I had the bbq chicken dinner with Mac and cheese and onion rings. Let's start with the chicken. Bbq chicken has to see some smoke or at least a grill. You can not take baked chicken and put sauce on it and call it bbq chicken. Next the sauce. Maybe it's an Arizona thing but that was watered down ketchup at best. Onion rings were pre made. Mac and cheese pre made. I am guessing the chicken....wait for it.....pre made. Sorry Shane but when you travelled the country talking to family about good times and bbq you should have stopped into a bbq place here and there to see how it is done. And a person can purchase a franchise to sell more below average bbq. If your ever in Oklahoma Shane give me a call. I will take you to eat some mouth watering bbq that will have you refunding franchisees money when you get back home."}
{"text":"Last review from my Emily my Niece as we completed our short vacation to Charlotte NC. My comments follow.  \"Hello again this shall be one of my last reviews so I hope you like it. I personally think that Shanes is a pretty good rib shop. A great deal there is the big daddy. The big daddy is a sandwich with chopped pork barbecue but u get it plain with no sauce there is a booth there you can BBQ sauce. They have original, hot, and spicy. I enjoyed my lunch!\"  My comments Pros - Good smokey ribs (full rack about $19). NC BBQ (pulled pork). Big Daddy BBQ sandwich. Sides: Brunswick Stew, slaw, mac & cheese. - All you can handle BBQ sauce - very tasty - good kick. - Mall parking - Great NC hospitality & service (\"Sir\", everything OK, etc). - Plenty of seating inside  Cons - Full rack of ribs didn't seem like full rack I normally get in California.  Return Visit - Yes, next time I'm in NC"}
{"text":"From the outside I thought it was a sit down restaurant, when actually it was a fast food type joint.  I've tried the pulled pork and the chicken sandwhich. Quite subpar: very chewy and not fresh at all. When I recieved my pulled pork sandwhich I noticed that the meat was scooped on the bread, cafeteria style...YUCK.  There are better BBQ places out there."}
{"text":"The smoked wings in medium sauce were very good.  I have been twice and had the wings both times.  Falling off the bone smokey goodness that's hard to find in a restaurant. Try it, you'll like it.  The tea is also good."}
{"text":"pretty good ribs and sides. although i think the platter prices are a bit high. good prices on just meats though. so you could  just purchase a whole rack and make your own sides at home. I am still on the fence about which sauce i like the best. so cant really help in that department. daughter and myself got the whole slab platter and split it since it comes with 2 sides. and purchased and extra drink, got the small drink since its a self serve station."}
{"text":"Food was very...meh...at best. Ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, which is tenders on bread for some reason so don't expect to be able to pick it up and eat it. They forgot to sauce the tenders so it was just dry unseasoned chicken. Service is poor, spent 20 minutes trying to flag down a server to get some sauce for it while being ignored, finally asked someone in the kitchen but I guess she forgot? Had to get back to work from lunch so I didn't have 45 minutes to kill waiting for sauce. They did finally bring it as I was leaving and it was just like...uh thanks, I guess? Fries were served cold, greasy and unseasoned. Chicken was at least cooked well, with a nice crunch, but it would have been nice to actually have some flavor or seasoning on it.  Can't speak to the bbq but the chicken was their daily special so I figured I'd give it a try, don't think I'll ever be coming back. Waste of 11$. Should have checked Yelp before eating here."}
{"text":"FREE sandwich for your birthday for joining the E-Club!!  I got the \"BIG DAD\" pork sandwich-pork on texas toast!! Fantastic!! I really like their HOT bbq sauce just the right amount of heaT!  I'm addicted to the Brunswick Stew & of course I had to get some! Sooooo Good!!  It doesnt get any better than FREE and even though this place is in BFE and probably cost $10 in gas it was definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"Tasty BBQ place!!!!  Food is really good considering since it's technically more of a fast food place.  The portions are HUGE.  The only drawback is that we went for kids eat free night (Wednesday's) and in order to take advantage of the deal you HAVE to order 2 drinks.  We pretty much only drink water but were forced to pay $2+ for a fountain drink each.  Kinda defeats the purpose of the free kids meal.  I'd rather kids meals just be half off and not have to purchase a drink"}
{"text":"Yummy... Very yummy. Portions are more than adequate. This was great because I had leftovers for the next day. We felt the pricing was a bit high for eating out of plastic baskets with parchment paper liners...   But when comparing it to the other two dominant BBQ joints out west, Dillon's (which is not to our flavor liking, way overpriced, paltry portioning, and sides that are memorable for blandness) and Famous Dave's (which has great sauces, but lacking in meat quality at times, with sides that are ok but not memorable) Shane's is our newest favorite. It bumps Dave's to a distinct second because the meat was absolutely tender and stands on its own without drowning in sauce and the sides (fries, sweet potato fries, and slaw) are better all around!  Regrettably, they are not close enough to home to simply 'swing by' for a  take out order!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've lived in NC for so long and I can't believe I just found this place. Krista was awesome explaining the menu to us and really helped us out! We tried basically everything; I had the barbeque sandwich with cole slaw and my husband had the sampler. There is just nothing bad to say about it. It was all so delicious and had great customer service. We found a new favorite eating spot :)"}
{"text":"I have ordered from Shane's 2 times. The total of both orders was $130.00+. That is 65 dollars per order. I ordered through yelp for delivery, but when I went to order today, it said the restaurant is closed, so I called the restaurant. The restaurant is open and gave me the the number to a delivery service. When I called the delivery service I got hung up on twice. I called the restaurant back and spoke with Lina. She took my number and told me that she would get a hold of the delivery service and get the order to me. I didn't hear back, so I called the restaurant twice more. They didn't answer the phone anymore and I have wasted 30 minutes of my time trying to get delivery. The food isn't that great, I just wanted BBQ and this place is close to where I live. I just moved here from Florida and my car hasn't been shipped here yet, so I don't have a way to pickup the food. I was also going to take my coworkers here for BBQ on Friday, since it is my turn and I was going to pay for their meals since I am a consultant for honor health and I like to do nice things for my customers. That said, I will not be taking them to Shane's as I had planned. This experience leaves me not wanting to have anything to do with this restaurant ever again. Their baked beans taste like they came out of a can, their coleslaw is bland and their macaroni and cheese is not as good as Kraft Mac and cheese. Their brisket is OK, nothing special and their ribs are decent, the pulled pork is a little over fatty. If you read my review history, you will see that this is my ONLY negative review ever. Buyer beware..."}
{"text":"My husband I come here at least once a month.. love the half rack of ribs!! Great food and get the food fast.. great bang for your buck. I have recommended this place to many.. LOVE IT!!  Perfect BBQ.. I'm not a fan of smoked meat but it's said to have good smoked chicken, etc. as I said I'm not a fan of smoked but love the ribs( they're not smoked) but OMG they are good!!"}
{"text":"Shane's Rib Shack has been a longtime tenet of Westgate, but despite all the events I've been to at Jobing.com Arena and University of Phoenix Stadium in the last several years, I actually have not eaten there.  That finally changed before yesterday's Coyotes game.  Shane's is what it is.  Fast food Barbecue.  Not the best food I've ever had, but certainly not something that would regret.  The \"Big Dad\" is a nice big pile of barbecue pork between two big slices ofTexas Toast.  I really didn't care for the buttery taste of the toast, but the pork itself was very flavorful, and shane's \"secret\" sauce is wonderful.  It has a sweet flavor with a slight kick.  As a regular combo, it's about $8 for the sandwich plus a side and a drink.  I had the potato salad which was just okay, and decided to try their sweet tea.  If you love sweet tea, you'll probably really love Shane's.  If you're like me who poured my drink \"half and half\" (with a ratio closer to 60% unsweetened and 40% sweetened) and still felt that it was way too sweet, I'd recommend you steer clear.  Shane's is good stop before heading to an event at the stadium or arena.  Or somewhere to eat before or after hitting up a movie at the AMC.  But like everything else in Westgate, I wouldn't recommend it as something to go out of your way to try."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch... though I used to think the portion sizes were great, but now me-thinks they are a bit much.  Last time I came, the BBQ was great... just too much of a good thing though.  Didn't feel too well after eating.  My philosophy is to wipe your plate clean, I HATE to waste food - at least you know you get your moneys worth here.  I did try the \"spicy\" BBQ sauce available at the counter and it had a good zip to it.  I think next time I will try the BBQ sanwhich instead of the plate, maybe it will be juuusssttt right...  sorry for sounding like Goldilocks and the 3 Bears."}
{"text":"I was attending an event close by and at the council of my associates we decided on this place.  The experience started on the wrong foot as it took forever just to order the food. The woman at the register was kind and helpful, nonetheless.   The food is where this place falls short. The half chicken was actually very good. That alone I would give a 4/5. The mac & cheese wasn't terrible but subpar. But the ultimate disappointment was the brisket. I ordered the 2 meat meal and even paid extra for it. It looked like pulled pork and was by far worst brisket I've had. To be honest, I had never had a bad brisket until this.   By no means am I telling you to not come here, just stay away from the brisket, and go for the chicken."}
{"text":"Our first time here and it was delicious. We had the BBQ chicken sandwich. I loved the cole slaw and the BBQ chicken. It wasn't too heavy or too full of sauce. Great tasting meat. Also, the outdoor seating is nice and relaxing. We brought our four legged friends and we sat outside."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat because the service and food are so great. I went in for a sampler tonight and was happy to see it on special. I was disappointed to be charged regular price, that was rectified quickly. I had to ask for my drink cup after waiting another few minutes. Got my order fairly quickly, and drove home. I was ready to dive into my food and was really sad to find the half rack of ribs were missing!!!! Not my typical experience, and since there were so many missteps I had to say something. I will give them another try."}
{"text":"Oooooo words can not describe the feeling I get in my stomach as I think about this place.... it starts in the stomach and slowly works it's way up the throat leaving pangs of desire as it travels upward and heads into the mouth region. As it assaults your mouth with a sense of deep longing for some of that back slappin goodness just makin you sure u ain't gonna survive without any of it. Buuut just as you think it's just about over that feeling overtakes your brain an the rest of your senses and refuses to release its hold on you and causing Shanes RS to be an ever present thought on your mind. The only remedy and I repeat the ONLY remedy to make this feeling go away is to indulge in the only thing that is on your mind and to enjoy life to the fullest while doin so. So... what are you waiting for?? Head on over to Shanes rib shack and get you some!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent for fast food BBQ their ribs are reallllly good. Reason why I give it 4 stars is because their sides weren't alll that great, the mac and cheese tasted like KFC.. potato salad was okay. I enjoyed the quality in customer service here, Thank You Shane's!"}
{"text":"Great service and food! Everything was hot and fresh and served with a smile. My wife had the Big Dad sandwich and Okra. (Of course I had to try some of her sandwich ). The BBQ was very good and had a nice smoke flavor all the way through. The different sauces available were very tasty and not too sweet. The honey based sauce was our favorite. Since this was our first visit I got the cowboy burger (we always hedge our food choice when trying a new place) The burger was great too! Overall we really enjoyed lunch. The food and service were great. On the way out we were even thanked for dining with them! I always like a place that appreciates our business and actually takes the time to say so. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Such a bad experience here. My boyfriend and I stopped in on a Thursday afternoon for lunch and we ordered at the counter as soon as we walked in. We sat down and for 30+ minutes we watched a women walk by with plate after plate full of food for 2 girls taking pictures of the food. I respect them for wanting to help these girls with their project but at the end of the day, they were not paying customers being served full meals FOR FREE while us and 4 other tables waited an extended amount of time for food we had all already paid for. After 35 minutes had gone by, an employee comes up to our table with my boyfriends food and informs me that my burger had been burnt so they had to cook another one. We waited at least 50 minutes before both of us could eat our food together. On top of the terrible service, not once did the lady who appeared to be the manager come up to our table and apologize nor were we offered a refund. We felt extremely disrespected and will never come to Shane's Rip Shack at Westgate ever again."}
{"text":"On 1/9/14 I made a review and down from here, on 2/27/18 I took a co-worker out for dinner for a thank you, I placed the order at 6:40pm; requested a refund at 7:11pm receipt #2059.  It took 32mins to receive our order, 1st in line.  All the food was cold and was missing item(s).  Third time may not be the CHARM."}
{"text":"This place is gimmicky, it's a small place loaded with stuff all over the walls. Order, and sit.  Our waitress lady was really nice, came back to check on us often asking how everything was.  I got the chicken plate, it was alright. I really liked the sauce. I wasn't like loving it, but I didn't hate it.   The Cole slaw was terrible, like, \"oooo hell no don't eat that nasty shit\" then slap the fork out of your hand nasty. At least to me, you may dig it idk.   The fried okra, and those hush puppies were soooooo sooo good. We came here when they first opened, and I wasn't that impressed then.   We probably won't come back any time soon, but won't rule it out."}
{"text":"The food was good not great. Also from the time we ordered it took 45 mins to get our meal. I'm sure the waitress forgot to put it in as everyone else at the restaurant was eating for at least 10 mins before we got our food. They also added extra fried for the wait... not impressed!"}
{"text":"Day one of my Vegetarian diet...that I'm starting tomorrow.  It's actually part of the plan.  Really!  I'm just prepping my body for the shock of the lack of meat protein.  So when in the Cackalacks I had to seek out some of that famous BBQ.     I've never had Carolina BBQ so I had to indulge.  To get a good roundabout idea of what its all about I opted for the sampler plate, vice one of everything on the menu.  Don't want to indulge too much, after all I am on a diet!  On the scale of American BBQ's this was okay.  TX BBQ is, in my opinion, da best!  Not to say this was horrible or anything.  The meat was cooked well but still juicy.  Ribs were unique, on the sweet side ( I guess thats the way they do it in the Cackalacks)   Chicken was good.  I had some grilled fillets with their Buff-Q sauce.  Sauce was okay too.     I had the peach tea, which I thought was really good.  Not too sweet but sweet enough.  I'm already sick of sweet tea.  Not here, but just in general.     The service was good, although the server dropped my toast.  She did offer me to get another one but never came back with it.  I ate it anyway.  (she dropped it on the table!)  She was friendly and thoughtful though.  Just have to follow through.     Overall, didn't blow my socks off in the way of BBQ's in general but as far as Carolinian BBQ, I'm still on a limb about it.   This review might change as I experience more.  Must sample more.  Thank God I'm on a vegetarian diet."}
{"text":"Save your money and take it to smoke pit just down the road! The money you pay at this place is not worth it. I got the sampler so I could try a little bit of everything. The chicken tenders were pretty good. The Barbecue was terrible bland no smoky flavor, well no flavor in general. The ribs were decent but not enough meat on them. The worst thing I had was the macaroni and cheese, it was pre made and made Stoufers look home made. I was expecting the Mac and cheese to be home made but it was terrible, I didn't even finish it. My wife got the Brunswick stew and she said it was ok but nothing to write home about. So all in all my experience wasn't to great ,because The Smoke Pit is right down the road and it is the best!  Tried it again and ripped off ! Got the chicken buffalo sandwich and a drink with fries it was 10$ I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"We got take out tonight and it was great!  When I was picking up the girl opened and showed me each container I ordered to ensure my order was right and I very much appreciated that!  We got a pound of pulled pork, half rack of ribs, hushpuppies, mac and cheese and slaw and it easily fed three adults and three kids!  Everything was great!  Mac and cheese looked like it was KYC with the cheese sauce but was far from it-delicious!  Ribs were tender and crunchy on the outside-hushpuppies-incredible!"}
{"text":"By far, the overall best BBQ in the West Phoenix Valley. We're picky, spending time in West Texas and South Carolina. We've visited the usual suspects that folks mention, but unless the meat almost falls off the rib, it just doesn't rate as BBQ. The pulled pork is tender without a lot of fat. To be fair, we haven't tried the brisket yet,  but we're getting there.  And they're Shack Sampler is enough for both of us to split without feeling like we ate a side of beef. An added plus, for us anyway, it's only a couple blocks from our house."}
{"text":"So bad! Don't even try it! Takes soooo long and when you finally get it it's cold and old! So dissatisfied and disappointed I will never come back! All four of us were ripped off, $40 i should have just burned."}
{"text":"Don't go here, stay away, service is horrible.. Takes 25 mins to order food on a line 5 people deep, then another 20 to get it.. Plenty of Staff walking around doing nothing while 1 girl is taking orders.. Food takes too long to get and not worth the money.. Worst service I have experienced in a long time. Made a mistake trying this place again.. Should have drove a bit farther to Rudys.."}
{"text":"If you go to or work at UNC Charlotte you know and love this place. Great service and good specials. Owner is actively involved and greets the regulars by name. Big fan of the chicken fingers."}
{"text":"Um yeah not so much. Over priced for sure. Chicken Tenders and sweet tea are fine. Other than that....ribs are dry and bland and smothered in sauce. And when I think of brisket....I think sliced. No sauce. Not chopped and smothered in sauce. You can tell it is but it could be a chuck roast. The manager tried to accommodate but sorry this is garbage. Rather go to Rudy's. Not a fan at all."}
{"text":"My 2 review is all about the food:( I ordered the pork sandwich with a side of potato salad, and my mom ordered a grilled chicken BBQ wrap. My pork was so gross, tasted like it was boiled and reheated. Definitely not smoked pulled pork, and the Texas toast was super greasy. I only ate a couple bites and threw the rest away. The potato salad was your basic mustard potato salad, nothing special. The grilled chicken wrap was pretty tasty, well anything was tasty compared to my sandwich:/ so if I am ever forced to eat here again, I would go with a chicken wrap or salad.... Just another chain restaurant serving ok food to the masses."}
{"text":"I called three times to place an order and could never get an answer. I decided to go anyway because I was craving the amazing peach cobbler. When I got there the place was packed with several people waiting on Togo orders so I guess they are doing something right. Tenders were really good. They should make it where you can add gratuity on an electronic payment. The two cashiers were busy and friendly and I don't carry cash."}
{"text":"Nothing like fast food BBQ.  Pretty good place.  We came in here before we went around for bike night.  Food came out fast and tasted pretty good.  Had the ribs and some okra.  Ribs could have been smoked a little longer to fall off the bone, but they were still good."}
{"text":"I love visiting this location. This was my first \"Shane's\" restaurant I tried but it was worth it. When me and my family visits a nice lady named Kristen Is very awesome. She adores my toddler son and always steps above and beyond to make sure we're provided quality service. If there's a problem with the food; they're quick to replace the food hassle free.  The food may not be as hot to my liking all the time but it's always fresh and the boneless/bone in wings has a lot of meat. The dips/bbq sauces are unlimited and the peach tea is always disappearing lol."}
{"text":"Bbq? Really? The food is obviously mass produced in the morning and left sitting out all day. The bbq was served to me at room temperature and with no seasoning! WTF? I guess I had to go over to the condiment table and douse the meat with all sorts of sauce. I know this a chain restaurant but so is McDonald's and McDonald's produces a good hot burger and delicious fries. I don't think I'll be returning to this place."}
{"text":"I had wanted to try Shane's for a while, simply because it sounds good.  I mean you get a lot out of a name like \"Rib Shack\".  How could it not be good?  We went and tried the sampler - chicken fingers, ribs, and barbecue (sorry, I spell my 'cue with a C).  All-in-all, it wasn't bad, but I can't say that I'll be back looking for more anytime soon, and that's for three reasons.  One: The sides were okay.  Two: The 'cue was average, and if I'm going to go for average, I'll go somewhere closer.  Three, and most importantly: We actually went by on election day, where they said if you wear your sticker when you come by, you get free food.  Then when we tried, they said they weren't doing it.  That's just wrong.  Now the folks at Shane's are very nice - the staff has always been very friendly.  But the food just isn't that good.  It's decent and all, but I agree with Tony - if you're after good 'cue, go somewhere that has it.  I'd suggest McKoy's personally, but his suggestions are good too."}
{"text":"My family & I were trying to kill some time before watching the hobbit movie. We all decided to get something to eat. It was my first time eating at Shane's Rib Shack. I didn't know what to expect from this place.   When we walked in Shane's Rib Shack it smelt so good of BBQ. The servers were very nice and welcoming with a big smile on their face.   As we were seated they immediately took our drink orders and had answer for our questions. The workers were positive & professional at all times. The food was VERY delicious!!!  I had the Smother pull pork sandwich..with a side of baked beans. The coleslaw was delicious.   Looking forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of BBQ fav's.  I get the combo meal and split it with the wife.  The pulled pork is actually pretty good.    They also have a couple of hotties working here which is a plus."}
{"text":"I came here one night with a friend after some shopping. There was no kind and the place was pretty empty. I ordered a three price tender meal and a small order of wings with the buf-que sauce which is half barbecue and half buffalo. The sauce was interesting but I ordered the wings extra crispy and they weren't at all! The tenders were nice and crispy and I would order those again. The hush puppies are delicious and probably my favorite side. They have really delicious peach sweet tea. I love it!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I really like Shane's! I think they have great pulled pork, macaroni and cheese, and sweet potato fries. The one thing I'm not crazy about is their selection of Barbeque sauces. They have about 5 different ones, I just am not that into any of them! They are okay. They have them available for purchase which is nice. Be prepared for a lot of food!They have large portion sizes. The staff is rather kind as well."}
{"text":"My family and I went here before a Cardinals game during Football season and it was very good. My husband order half a chicken with beans and mac and cheese. I order the pork sandwich with mac and cheese. Our food came out quick and it came out hot. I really enjoyed the mac and cheese and my sandwich. I really like that they have their BBQ sauce out so you can put more on your sandwich. My husband enjoyed his meal. The people were very friendly and quick. I really like this BBQ place and have been back many time since. If you go during football season definitely get there earlier because it gets packed!"}
{"text":"The owner lady was super nice, she knew we were from out of town and was nice enough to give us shirts. The food is amazing love the Brunswick stew and the \"big dad\".  Would go here once a week if we lived here.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Shane's on my first visit while in town for work this week.  I had the two meat plate-great pulled pork-actually cooked but still juicy (I don't use the \"m\" word to describe food...that ruins it!) and the smoked wings (non-breaded) were tasty as well.   I had medium buffalo sauce on these and would recommend it.  Sides were good-co-workers with me liked the baked beans and fries, I liked the mac and cheese-very gooey!  A very relaxed place that takes a little effort to get to from the main road but is a good lunch spot that I'll visit when/if in this part of town again."}
{"text":"Amaaaaaaaaaazing BBQ the likes of which we have never found north of the Mason-Dixon Line! Large portions of pork and chicken complimented by great hush puppies, baked beans and more. A sweet experience enhanced by prompt delivery of meal ordered at the counter and Meleah's sweet smile. The only thing missing was a beer to  top it all off!"}
{"text":"The chicken is off the charts juicy and tender.  Perfect sauce to char combo. Strongly considering attacking another 1/2 a bird. Green beans were peppery and perfect. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Always a great place for lunch. I can get the grilled chicken tenders tossed in a sauce with a side veggie and walk out stuffed and not feel guilty for what I ate. On the other hand if I want something fried and greasy,  I can get that too! Great place for a lunch break or family dinner and won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Not sure what's up with all the good reviews for this place, at least the ones talking about the food itself. It is mediocre, at best, but I kind of think that's still giving it too much credit.   I went to this place along with my wife and neither one of us was particularly impressed with the food. I tried the pulled pork and she ordered the chicken sandwich and we both sampled each others' food. I have to argue that the chicken was a worse offender than the pulled pork, but the pork still wasn't great. Way too greasy and quite a bit of fat floating around.   We also tried the fries, which were so-so and the chicken tenders which were also mediocre. The worst part though, at least on my own plate, was the rack of ribs. These were literally soggy and way too greasy. The flavor was lacking too and I didn't even finish it because it grossed me out.   I'm not a BBQ connoisseur by any means, but I've been to enough places in the valley to know the difference between good and pure garbage. This was pure garbage, about what I should have expected from a \"fast food\" looking BBQ joint. What you get is absolutely what you pay for, it's fast, dirty and edible, but not much else. Also, like just about everything fast-food these days, you can also get better for the money if you're not in such a hurry.   I definitely will not be going back to this place because even for the money I do not think it was a good value. There are many other places in the same price range that offer a much better piece of pork than Shane's. Really disappointed too, as I had seen all the positive reviews here, but I guess sometimes the herd is off the mark."}
{"text":"\"How much did you spend?\"  \"Twenty-something.\"  \"We should have went to Chipotle.\"  If that exchange does not give any indication of our view, I will just type it out.  They are good, but they are a bit overpriced, and their food lacked that punch.  It does not help there are better restaurants in the vicinity.    The stew tasted like baked beans, the smothered BBQ chicken sandwich was bland, the Shaniac was okay, but it was very messy, and the sweeten tea was almost like straight sugar. So, that requires unsweetened to dilute it.    The better options in the area will not allow me to make a repeat visit.  I am not heart broken by it.  ~David"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this is literally the worst food I've ever tasted. I didnt'even eat much after 2 bites!  Gross, bland & no flavor shredded brisket & salad. Was quite expensive & so disappointed!  Brisket was shredded, dry & literally no flavor. Mac n Cheese had zero seasoning & salad was so terribly bland. Uckkky is all I can say. Will never go back!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ, great sides....but no brisket. Great relaxed atmosphere. Green beans were off the chart!"}
{"text":"**3.5 Stars**  OK, so I was aimlessly driving around this morning chomping at the bit for food.  I ended up on this side of town, and after circling to see what restaurants were here at Westgate, I decided to come here, and I'm kinda glad I did.  I found out that on your birthday you get a free sampler plate, so I went with that.  They have a decent selection of items on the menu, and the prices are fair.  I asked what came with the sampler plate, and he told me that it was chicken strips, ribs, shredded chicken or pork and ribs.  Well, guess what, I don't want the ribs because I don't eat pork! I asked if he could substitute the brisket for the ribs and he said no.  MINUS ONE STAR FOR THAT BUDDY.  They have brisket on the menu, but I guess its a no go for the sampler, and don't bother asking to swap it out.  SHAME ON THEM! Ugh, so annoying!  Overall, the food was okay.  Fast casual environment, and if you want quick BBQ, stop in.  Oh, and don't ask to swap out the ribs for brisket on the sampler..lol"}
{"text":"I have not been to this location but other ones with great service and great food for over ten years and this particular location is not on par with the other ones I've experienced. It could be due to poor leadership and commitment to service. I say that because other locations honor veterans with a military discount up to 25% while this location does not. Also I have only seen teenagers and staff under 25 visible, working here. Ok, now to my grievance. I placed my order at 12:14pm and it took till 12:43pm to arrive with a 30% filled facility. I'm very disappointed and no one seems to truly care."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner, while in the area,  because we have eaten at other locations before. I had the pulled pork, sweet potato fries and hush puppies while my husband had the chopped chicken, baked beans, with French fries. My husband said his chicken tasted TERRIBLE and there was barely any there, on his platter. My sweet potato fries were mushy and hush puppies weren't cooked thoroughly. I mentioned this to the young lady working the cash register and she told me that she would have them remake them. Order after order after order came out for customers, who came in after us, was brought to their tables. We waited, for quite some time, before I went back to the same young lady, asking where they were at so I could finish my meal. Again, she told me that she would check to see how much longer it would be. So, we waited for an additional 20 minutes, but NOTHING! We ended up just leaving. Apparently, it's MORE important for people, who are SUPPOSED to be working at doing their job, to play on their cell phone rather than doing their job and checking on their customers. TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE service."}
{"text":"second time in. was a great visit to my new favorite rib restraunt very pleasing staff really makes your nite out special. allways checking to see if you want a refill or how the food."}
{"text":"Big daddy BBQ barely warm mac and cheese was bad charged 1.89 for mac and cheese all food barely warm will not go there again"}
{"text":"It was good nothing special. I ordered smoked chicken with fries okra and some peach cobbler. Not sure if I would go back again."}
{"text":"My new favorite BBQ in the area.  One word!  FANTASTIC!  I had lunch there with two other people and we all three raved about their food.  I had Baby Back Ribs with green beans and fries.  I had read one review that the green beans were too hot, I assume they meant as in spicy.  They were very good, I couldn't detect any spiciness in them other than a little black pepper which the proprietor said they use in cooking them.  One of the other members in my party ordered the sampler plate and she loved everything.   I really love smoked wings and can't wait to come back and try theirs.    Shane's Rib Shack is on the top of my list for great BBQ!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here because the food is always good and right. I like my ribs extra well (burnt) and they always check with me to see if it's my desired level of crispness. I like the different choices of sauces. Everything here is good to me the meats, however don't be fooled when getting a regular side, it's on the small size. The peach tea is also a must try."}
{"text":"Today was our first ever experience here and we were blow away by everything! We ordered the two meat plate with ribs and smoked wings added a side and still didn't spend more than $20!!! I mean that's a steal! My husband and I split the plate and are stuffed and totally content. We will be back very soon and often! Our new favorite hang out. And the service is amazing!"}
{"text":"I give this place 3 and 1/2 stars. It's an alright place. I'll start off by saying the atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice. It's a small venue that makes you comfortable. The prices are average. $9-$14 or so for most of the dinner plates. I got my food within 5 min of ordering. Crazy fast cooking, but with that, my toast was undone, and they gave me the wrong salad dressing. The ribs are good but nothing crazy, the texture of the pulled pork was on point but the flavor was bland. The chicken tenders were great. Best part was they had many different kinds of bbq sauce.  Nice place to take your girl on a date to try something new if you like chain bbq joints."}
{"text":"Just picked up take out got BBQ sampler and pulled chicken I never ate BBQ that was this dry it was like jerky with some BBQ sauce over it. The ribs were so dried out it was like they were left in the oven for a year. For $27 could get better food at Wendy's or Jack in a box."}
{"text":"We were in the mood to try something new and BBQ was on our minds.   Shane's Rib Shack was close and we had never tried it so hey why not, right?  The two stars is for the service. The girls were great and we didn't have any problem with ordering or receiving our food. However, my husband ordered wings and I ordered ribs and we were so sick by the time we got home (we live 10 minutes away) that I was really glad my house has multiple bathrooms.   Having said that my son and our roommate were fine. Not sure what the problem was but I will not be eating here again sadly. I was hoping it was going to be good."}
{"text":"At work, we received a huge stack of coupons for a discount sandwich at the Happy Valley Rd & I-17.  Boy were we glad to get those coupons.  For a period of time, I had been eating here 3 times / week.  And that was a great run.  So now, eating there dozens of times, I can say the food each time is totally delicious - like criminally delicious.   When I am in the mood, I will willingly take the setback the \"Big Dad\" pulled pork sandwich will cause me in my nutritional dietary efforts.  And like it.  The food tastes so good likely because its very true to Southern BBQ cuisine is juiced with lots of that saturated fat stuff.  Whats also great are the chicken tenders.  You can get 4 or 6 and tell them you want different flavors on all of them.  Wow, thats heaven on earth to eat those.  I know that running extra miles on the canal will soon be necessary.  So now that the coupons are expired, I do not frequent Shane's as I consider this not a good value for lunch fare.  The portions are not adequate unless you order a side.  And since I dont drink soda, this is one of the places I can leave hungry."}
{"text":"Finally a location close by instead of having to go to Charlotte.    The food was excellent.  Fresh and hot.  Service was good also.  Little pricey though.   Will be returning.    Came here on a later date and got a salad with pork.  Had a problem with the salad.  They were very accommodating and exceeded in making me happy and fixing the problem.    The salad was a huge portion.  The bread was delicious too."}
{"text":"The employees were polite and helpful , bit very pricey,   I have the brisket sand, coleslaw, drink $ 14.00 I food was just OK nothing to tell people to stop by."}
{"text":"Always pass by this place and think \"I should try there\" because I am so in LOVE with ribs. Went out with a friend and had some spare time and decided to check it out and OMG, I am glad that we did. I ordered a half rack with mac n' cheese and fries and the serving was plentiful. The ribs were extremely tender, the mac n' cheese was awesome and the fries were piping hot! My friend ordered a pulled pork sandwich, which came on two slices of texas toast and I have never seen such a large amount of meat on a sandwich before. It was so plentiful and awesome and messy, she had to eat it with a fork and knife! Not to mention, the service was extremely quick. As soon as I sat down, my name was being called. Definitely going to be a new weekly place for me after church on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Blech, I love good bbq, this is not the place.  The sauces taste like a bunch of seasonings mixed into water,  very powdery feel in your mouth.  The mac and cheese was pretty well...ok. Edible food but I would not pay for it."}
{"text":"The food was good. I don't recall what I had, but I do recall it was delicious.  The location, on the edge of West Gate, is convenient to be able to get to without crossing the center.  I will likely return, as I have a friend that lives adjacent to West Gate."}
{"text":"After spending a fantastic day on Lake Pleasant, we chose to stay at a hotel on Happy Valley Rd. but were too tired to go out for dinner. Checked on who delivered and chose this restaurant. Ordering was easy but really, you charge for forks. You would think your patrons might want to eat the food... Ordered the Brisket plate with okra and potato salad and the chicken fingers with Mac and cheese and coleslaw. The best part of the meal were the side dishes. The chicken fingers were so overcooked that I only ate one and threw the rest away but the slaw was tasty as was the Mac and cheese. The brisket faired somewhat better but overall a huge disappointment. Delivery was fairly fast but be careful because they automatically add a tip to the bill."}
{"text":"I got carry out from this place last night, and ordered the bbq chicken. I've always liked it, but this time around there was quite a bit of gristle in my order. I know it's difficult for the restaurant itself to avoid that, but I feel like it should be mentioned. Overall, I've always liked the place and would recommend it, even despite the occasional hiccups."}
{"text":"Recommend the sample plate. The ribs were tasty and the Brunswick stew was on point and loaded with that smoky meat. My sides were macncheese and okra. Iwas good and I loved the selection of sauces. The peach cobbler has my vote as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Piles of food for a family friendly price. Can't get enough of their Mac and cheese. Try their fabulously smoked Chicken or pork, shredded or sliced swimming in in-house made sauce, MMMM! A variety of sauces to choose from, have them add it or you can add your own. Service is great, very friendly."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. They wasted my time. I waited for 30 minutes for a to go order of half of rack of ribs and sweet potato fries. They took my money and never put my order in. The manager was nice enough to apologize and refund my money. Yeah thanks"}
{"text":"Great BBQ and lunch place - Great variety on the menu of BBQ items and the prices are reasonable.     The peach cobbler for dessert is to die for.    I highly recommend this as a place to go for a great meal and quick place to eat.  Not a place to take a date on in a formal setting but great food with great service.  The persons that rated this low are just plain wrong - I make a point to get here every time I come from out of town on work.  Try it out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice great place to eat. Friendly people. Food was really good had ribs. Chicken and kids loved the boneless chicken wings. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone"}
{"text":"Most of the time you do get a pretty great sandwich, but that's the issue many places have--most of the time rather than all of the time. The managers don't really want to hear your complaint even if it is legitimate."}
{"text":"Went here for pregame meal. Thought we would try something new. I got the pulled pork sandwich. Delicious,  Smokey, juicy,  with the regular  bbq sauce, down right awesome. My girl got the black and blue burger, she said it was delicious,  char  broiled and juicy. The sweet tea, peach was excellent. Service was quick, attentive and  friendly. When you going to come to Tucson?"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great. Going here is better than not having BBQ at all, but there are other places you might want to try if you're looking for some real, good BBQ."}
{"text":"It's really great food! The people are nice and do a great job! The place was clean my observation was that you order food like a fast food place but the prices are sit down restaurant but still I gave it 4 out 5 real good food! And that's what it is all about isn't it?? Check out the specials that's"}
{"text":"I would say this place is like the McDonald's of BBQ, but that is not fair to McDonalds. This is a counter service, please don't ask the staff for anything (even silverware), kind of joint. I had a half a rack of ribs that was dry and tough, mac and cheese that was greasy, not creamy, and flavorless green beans. The only plus was that the food was hot. I feel like this chain restaurant doesn't care about the quality of their food, they just want to dish out something to make a buck. I don't feel like I got a bad experience, I think this is just what this place has to offer, so take it or leave it; as for me, I'll leave it."}
{"text":"Good, quick BBQ  Even though it's something of a BBQ fast food place, I like Shane's. The half-slab is a lot of food and two of their sauces are yummers. The meat doesn't have as much smoke favor, but is tasty and not fatty like some places.   One cool aspect of Shane's is they have a number of options that appeal to our kiddos. They usually go for the breaded chicken tenders, but can also go for a simple cheeseburger or the Mac n' Cheese. Their pulled pork sandwich gets pretty good comments, as well. And my wife loves sweet tea, so it works that they have that.  You can come across a person at the register who will not wow you. On balance though, service staff are usually cool. I've also seen Shane's at a community fund raiser event, so happy to support a business that tries to give back to the community. No all do.  Definitely worth a visit..."}
{"text":"Awesome food! ... Service could be improved however love the sampler platter!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. Will it be the best BBQ you've ever had? Probably not (if you've grown up around here). But you can't beat the pulled pork sandwich for about $5.50 here. For a couple more bucks add a drink and a side (lot of sides to choose from). They also have their own sauces, their mustard sauce is some of the best I've ever had.  For what it is, this place gets 5 stars from me any day."}
{"text":"BBQ is done a few different ways and I know lots of people that really like this place but I am not one of them and would not go back.  It reminds me of the pit style BBQ they have in Alabama.  Nothing was really wrong I just don't like this style of BBQ."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of enjoying their Family Style Meal this week.  Oh Lord was it GOOD !  Dang, it made me homesick.  The Pork BBQ sandwich was strangely addicting, kinda like I imagine crack would be if I had ever tried it.  lol  I found myself craving those toasted slightly sweet buns piled high with pork bbq goodness all weekend.  Luckily there is not one near my house and I am on a strict mission to fit into a dress come November.  I do predict Shane's will be a monthly treat, one well worth waiting for."}
{"text":"My first review on Yelp because somebody needs to tell it like it is.  I ordered the baked potato with bbq because the place was new to me and I felt it was a safe choice.  The girl at the counter where you order was super nice.  30 minutes later they brought the potato out and was, at best, room temperature.  While waiting, several others were entering to the dirty tables and floors and those before me were sending their food back for various reasons."}
{"text":"My coworkers and myself we love the food at Shane's especially the loaded pulled pork potatoes and the pulled pork sandwiches. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that loves barbecue"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was delicious. Since this was my first time eating at this restaurant, i wasn't sure what to get. The staff was very patient as i made up my mind. I ordered the half chicken plate with Mac and cheese and fries. The chicken was piping hot and had the authentic bbq taste that i wanted. I will be coming back again very soon!"}
{"text":"Overall, I recommend. The pulled chicken and it was a little dry so I use extra BBQ sauce to bring freshness to it. BBQ food tends to be greasy so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Ribs are the best here! Better then famous daves and you don't have to wait 30 minutes.  This is a good rib place if you want something to eat before you go to the movies!"}
{"text":"Was taken here for lunch on a weekend. The portions were really large for the price. The tables were sticky and the bathrooms were both pretty gross. The service was ok as they just bring you your food and you don't really need to see them again after that.   The fries were good, as was the chicken, though it was drowned in sauce that while tasting okay was so heavy that I found myself scraping it off to try and actually taste the chicken. My fault for not asking for the sauce on the side. I will probably try it again but it wasn't anything special overall.  Update: Went back and got the chicken without sauce. Much, much better. Though two people could easily share a 6 piece chicken basket. It's a lot of food. I would definitely go back when I'm in the mood for some chicken and fries."}
{"text":"Not all Shane's are created equal. The one at Westgate is consistently good. This one, not so much. I've been here twice, the most current time earlier today. The food was very mediocre and the side of fries that came with the chicken was maybe a small handful. We also requested sauce several times and never got it. We requested one dressing and got a different one and honestly, most of our food ended up in the trash. It's really not worth going back to see if the third time is the charm."}
{"text":"Tasted AWESOME! The staff was super nice. Had good text and Facebook deals. Got a free peach cobbler for liking on facebook. Ordered the sampler-tasty. Portions were great. I'll be back. My first visit was a good one"}
{"text":"Shane's is a frequent lunch hangout place in the University area. My favorite item on their menu is the Big Mom. This is absolutely the best chicken salad sandwich  in Charlotte. It's tender and the chicken is fine chopped. The surprise of the flavor is the smokiness infused in the chicken salad. They also have large burgers that are pretty darn good. The only thing I wish they would add to their menu is a vegetable plate of sides for those times when I don't want a sandwich, wrap or wings.   Oh, one more thing - if you ever want a warm scoop of peach cobbler - this is your place!!"}
{"text":"Very nice set up inside for a chain, and the staff was very knowledgable when it came time to order.  I ordered the 2 meat combo, pulled pork and ribs.  It came with 2 sides so I got the fried Okra and Mac n cheese. The pulled pork was very tasty and super moist.  The ribs were fall off the bone delicious cant believe I finished both because the portions were huge! Fried Okra was fresh with the perfect balance of seasoning crunch on outside and soft on the inside.  Mac was good and cheesy! I am giving it 5 stars because the food and  staff.  Staff picked up my bone dry plate and cleared the table for me.  I will definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"Shane's surprised me! I went here with a coupon that I received to try it out and was surprised to find barbecue like I was used to from North Carolina! We had the ribs and pulled pork sandwiches. My kids loved the sandwiches. The ribs were very moist and tender, with just the right amount of seasoning. The sauce didn't overwhelm them, yet enhanced the flavor even more. The cold slaw was delicious. I have to say that I'm a bit particular about BBQ since we take pride in the Carolina BBQ back home, but the pulled pork was right on point! It has a vinegar base like we southern folk gravitate to. The service was excellent, we were catered to graciously (which came in handy with the kids.) I would totally recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Decent food and good service. The cashiers have been very polite every time we go in there and we always comment on it."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, loved the peach cobbler mmmmm delicious, mac and cheese was fabulous :) will definitely be back!! :)"}
{"text":"loved the food especially the peach cobbler. Order the sampler its enough food for two people. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've walked by it for Panda a million times over and never thought to eat here because I'm not a \"rib\" guy. We stopped in and took a chance and got the tenders!!!  So happy we did!  What a very nice and clean place with really good help working there!  It's become a new favorite for us!"}
{"text":"My family ate here last night. The food was decent except for the macaroni and cheese. It tasted like it had been sitting out for awhile. However, we will likely not return as the restaurant was filthy. It was slow and the tables were empty, but they were dirty. The floor was riddle with trash under tables. The floors were sticky from not being cleaned. And, it had a trash/sewage order. There was one worker who was working hard and the rest were all standing around talking. You could tell very poorly ran."}
{"text":"Stopped through to pick up a few of my faves for the weekend \"treat myself, don't cheat myself\" ! So I called ahead and ordered the \"Big Dad\" the Two Meat plate w chicken and ribs... \"Whoooo wheee\"!! Been here and I already know how they \"get down\", so I was hoping it would be business as usual, and it was (yessssss).. Arrived after  navigating traffic through crazy parking lot and was greeted warmly upon arrival.. A short minute or two and had my order fresh w Texas toast, green beans, and potato salad.. This place is on point, consistent, and service is friendly and welcoming. Be sure to ask for the homemade peach cobbler \"if you can hang\"  : ) ...I didn't think about pics because as usual my hands and mouth were fully engaged and \"assault\" was completed.  I'm coming back for smoked wings next time, heard they do them the Justice.... I've always ordered to go, but the dining area always looks welcoming if ur in the mood to sit down and relax. I prefer UK get busy at home!  ; )"}
{"text":"Stopped by to check out some BBQ and was not disappointed! Got the sampler n 2 two meat plate with pork ribs n BBQ chx. Awesome flavor and not over done w seasonings.. I like that the customer service was prompt, helpful, and very courteous! I was in and out after placing an order to go.. This place definitely has my stamp of approval and I \"came up\" on NC style cue'. Kudos to the chefs and the service.. I'd recommend anyone curious to Get there and get U some!!"}
{"text":"Ribs!!!  This place is my favorite place for ribs, no question!  I was a little iffy about coming here, but now I can't stop.   When I first walked in, I thought the environment's decorations were nice.  Nothing fancy, but it had a homey feeling.  There are some TV's scattered around the restaurant so that you can watch a game while you're eating.  I don't really care about that because I'm always in the zone when I eat, but others may not be dedicated like I am.  As soon as you walk through the door, the counter for you to order the food is smack right there!  Very convenient.  So let's get on to the ribs.  BOMB.  Have I ever tasted anything so delish?  Well, yeah, but the ribs are pretty up there on my delicious food list.  I am never disappointed time after time again when I visit.  On Saturdays, they have a special where the half rack of ribs are $10, so I find myself there on occasionally weekends.  Their potato salad isn't too shabby either!  If you're in the University area, you definitely need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Food  was great every time we've stopped by. At westgate so expect lines during peak hours. The staff was friendly the food might take a while depending on how many people are there. Prefer Shane's over Buffalo Wild Wings any day"}
{"text":"Went back to Shane's tonight because we got what we thought was a really good deal via text. BBQ, 2 half chickens, 4 sides for $25... we haven't been in several months because the last couple of times we went, the food was cold and had to be sent back.    Well, we thought tonight would be better. Unfortunately, the chicken was so dry, we could not swallow it. We took this home or I would have asked for the money back. I get that smoking may be hard, but this was inedible. The BBQ was good thankfully. The stew was also good. But both half chickens went to waste.   This place used to be really good. We would go twice a week.. it's just gone downhill in food quality.   The service tonight was really good - very nice..   Shame the food wasn't."}
{"text":"I have been to several Shane's Rib Shacks over the years, to include the North Lake location, Lancaster Hwy and now University. Normally I get take-out but I have dined in a few times. Usually the employees are friendly, the place is clean, food is pretty good etc. Today I started craving some so I decided to stop by. OMG if this food today was a woman I would marry it. It is extra extra good. It actually threw me for a loop. Whoever cooked today did a banging a$$ job! Thanks Shane's University."}
{"text":"The food is great! However, the tables and booths always seem dirty and they have gnats that come from somewhere inside the walls to attack you while you eat."}
{"text":"Great prompt service no waiting and the food was very good, they only thing that kept me from giving this place 5 stars is the bottles of bbq sauce they have on the tables were very sticky. Other then that it was a very good place to eat at, and we will be back to give them another try."}
{"text":"The first trip there i stood and waited at the register for several minutes and no one came to the front. I decided to give them another shot.  Ok I admit I am spoiled when it comes to BBQ....ahhhh Rudy's BBQ I miss ya.  While this is MUCH better than the other \"BBQ\" or \"Steak/Roadhouses\"  in the area.  The collard greens were too strangely sweet.  The cobbler tasted like they used bacon grease for the paste they call a crust.   I may go again for the meat but I will pass on the sides."}
{"text":"The ribs ... omg you have to try them. I went here for dinner looking for something filling. This did not disappoint. I ended up getting the sampler, which was delicious. The citrus chipotle bbq sauce had an amazing flavor and good kick to it.  The sampler came with ribs, chicken tenders, pulled pork or chicken, and two sides, which I chose mac and cheese and sweet potato fries. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone good. Very tender and flavorful. The chicken tenders had an amazing crust to them that went well with the sauce. You can choose to have the tenders mixed with the sauce or on the side. The pulled chicken was just okay, could have been a little more flavored and not as doused in sauce. Overall, it was good.   Definitely will be back if I'm in the mood for ribs and I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ for a reasonable price.  The Spicy with a little bit of Sweet BBQ sauce is incredible.  Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"For a quick fix for a BBQ craving this place is great!   We got the sampler and it was more than enough for 2 people; we added a side of hush puppies.  The ribs were pretty good. Not the best I've ever had but certainly not the worst. The fries were really crispy. I personally prefer softer fries, but they were good.  The pork was good. Typical Carolina style.  The bread was good. Typical BBQ style as well.  The chicken tenders were amazing! We got the BBQ sauce mixed with the hot sauce flavor and it was delicious!  The hush puppies were honestly amazing! They were my favorite part! Little pieces of corn. Mmmm mmmm good!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last week. Overall, I would eat here again but only get the pulled pork.   I went with the. Sampler platter with ribs, pulled pork, and chicken tenders. The ribs were great and not overly sauced and the pulled pork was the best I've ever had. The chicken tenders were a no go for me.   The service was very good overall."}
{"text":"My boyfriend suggested we eat at Shane's. I'd never gone before. Sinc he's picky about where he eats it thought it'd be better. Shane's did NOT meet my expectations for a BBQ joint. It's more like a Micky D's of BBQ.   I ordered the chicken sandwich and baked beans. The baked beans were good but the sandwich was a joke. I could have baked chicken breasts in my oven and slathered them with sauce and sold them. That's basically what I got. When I'm thinking of greeting the BBQ chicken I'm thinking its chopped not cubed. The sauces are very runny which made for a pitiful sandwich.....big chunks of chicken and runny sauce.   I'm glad I didn't pay for the meal and I won't recommend going to Shane's."}
{"text":"Staff is fabulous! They are very happy, professional, knowledgeable and conscientious. The ribs are good. This is a family friendly restaurant with easy access and fast service."}
{"text":"BBQ is really good!  Best ribs anywhere! Sides are great too. Employees are very friendly and want to serve you with a smile!"}
{"text":"The South is known to be slow paced. This restaurant really recreates that feeling.  We arrived to dine in and noticed that the restaurant was pretty full and thought that was a good sign that it was a good place but we were WRONG.   My wife ordered a combo plate with chicken tenders, pulled chicken, 1/4 rack of ribs, and a couple sides. I ordered the full rack of baby back ribs plate. It took OVER an hour to get ribs at a barbecue \"rib shack.\" As we sat, we saw the restaurant empty out and fill back up and those new people got their food before us. I'd say that probably 5 tables with about 15 people got their meals before our two plates came out. One of the tables next to us had a guy get up and leave due to how slow the service was.  About 45 minutes into our dining experience, the waitress let us know that the food was on its way but that \"ribs take a while to cook.\" It sounds like the restaurant was not prepared to serve its customers. The food arrived about an hour and ten minutes after we ordered with the explanation that \"there were a lot of other tickets.\" Of course there were a lot of tickets, we were there watching all of the other tables get their food first even though they got there after us.  The food tasted ok. The chicken tenders were dry and stringy. The ribs were good and I had no issues with the sides.  The service was substandard and the waitress rarely checked on us in the nearly 2 hour dining experience. I got up to refill my drinks and we walked to the counter to pay because we would still be waiting for the check.  Overall, I do not recommend this place and will not be back."}
{"text":"Coming from Texas, I was disappointed that there are no beef options...I'm a brisket girl. I panicked and got the chicken fingers. They are really good, homemade and juicy. My husband really liked the pulled pork sandwich, which is huge! The place is clean and staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Came here around 1pm on Sunday with 3 of my siblings and I was not impressed. The cashier was friendly and took my order.   I ordered BBQ nachos, an American style burger with fries and an order of 4 chicken tenders with fries. Total came out to be around $32. They charge around $3 for an extra cup! It was pretty busy when we came in but found a table next to the window. The floor was ridiculously sticky like someone spilled soda.   Went to get drinks and everything tasted awful. I literally questioned if I should return my cup because all the drinks were terrible. The food came out half an hour later and portion size was pretty big. Food was okay besides the BBQ chicken nachos. Way too greasy. My brother wanted to get some ketchup packets and they were dirty! Like someone oozed honey or something sticky all over them. Didn't really enjoy this place. Sadly, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to Shane's tonight. This location is training a new chef, however, and the chicken is overcooked and tough...that's the only reason for my less than great review this time.  Hopefully the next visit will be better!"}
{"text":"Decent fast food BBQ place.  They give you a lot of chicken for the chicken plate.  Comes with bread and two sides as well. Slightly pricey for a fast food type place, but again, the portions are generous. I liked the design on the interior (see pics).  Makes it more interesting than the standard boring white walls.  I would eat here again if I needed some BBQ food quickly.  Mac and cheese was a delicious side."}
{"text":"We did the penny date tonight and ended up in the plaza so I just started walking because I saw the little sign outside. We walked in with everyone saying hi. We looked at the menu on the wall to order. He had the sampler and I had the 2 types of meat plate ribs and BBQ pork with a side salad and mac n cheese. They peach tea is sooo good. We sat at a booth while making paper towel planes. They had four different BBQ sauces on the table also which was pretty good. The food was really good. The ribs was falling off the bone. I would go back."}
{"text":"Great barbecue! Order the pulled pork! It is to die, simply to die!  Kids eat free on Sunday's with the purchase of a plate."}
{"text":"We had the boneless chicken wings & some sides.  Hush puppies, baked beans.  Everything was good with enough to take home."}
{"text":"The ribs are out of this world. Great sauce and the flavor is fabulous! Nice cozy restaurant as the waitresses are helpful and friendly. You must try it if you enjoy ribs!"}
{"text":"Food pretty good. Had sampler because it was my first visit. Grilled tenders the best. The sides are okay. Had Mac and cheese and friend okra. Ribs also very good. But they better be since its rib shack. Thing I was most impressed by was the service. I work customer service and it's hard to find good customer service now a days. Shelby was the girl at counter taking orders, running food, boxing up to go orders, cleaning up tables and still came by to check up on me and that everything was good. Hard to come by that now a days."}
{"text":"OMG is this horrible!  First the ribs were dried out, old, tough and my husband's were cold.  Under no circumstances would I advise anyone to come here.  The food is absolutely horrible, green beans straight out of a can - no special seasoning or cooking.  Then when my husband took his ribs up and asked if they could please give him hot ones or heat them up they took the onion rings off of his plate and they didn't want to replace them.  Then they had to ask the manager before replacing them. This place is neither run right nor do they cook well.  Eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food is good , but average really. Peach cobbler is great and the owner is really nice ."}
{"text":"My to go order included ribs with baked beans and mac and cheese.  The ribs were meaty but lacked succulence. One of the slabs was darker (burnt) than it should have been.  The baked beans were right up my alley.  The kind of mac and cheese served is made with velveeta; not my cup of tea.  To their credit, I can proudly say the peach cobbler was some of the best I have ever had!  It was scrumptious.  I ordered a large so that we could share, but the portion was really only enough for one person, to my dismay.  Yum.  Now, I know where to go when I want something sweet."}
{"text":"The food I ordered was fresh and hot. It didn't take long to get your food once ordered. I would definitely recommend Shane's to a friend."}
{"text":"This place is more like Shane's Poop Shack in my humble opinion. we arrived and we're greeted, the staff was very nice. we ordered a bit of everything because it was our first visit and I love BBQ.   The place was dead. it was prime lunch time so I was a bit skeptical. anyway, we got our food and started digging in.  The ribs, the brisket, the chicken, pulled pork was all very over cooked and very bland. my ratings are purely based on food and quality. The food was almost not edible and sadly we wont be coming back. very overpriced.  all in all the place was clean and the service was friendly but when it comes down to it, the food needs to be on point!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with my family and enjoyed some pulled, western style BBQ. The hush puppies were pretty good and had while corn kernels inside, but the serving was diet-friendly.   I had my BBQ on the baked potato, but was disappointed by the cheese. The cheese seemed more like Cheese Whiz than real cheddar or jack cheese. I love me a BBQ baked potato, but this one I did not love."}
{"text":"Great place to eat if you like your food cold and microwaved! Haven't been here in over a year, thought we would give it another chance, bad idea! Chicken cold, pork plate cold, baked beans cold..green beans cold! That was the problem a year ago. Geez, only thing hot was fries, hush puppies! Will 'NEVER ' go back again!  I just didn't not get it, is really that hard to have hot food?"}
{"text":"I really like Shanes. I especially love their smoked wings finished off on the grill. We had a coupon. Two 1/2 racks of ribs 1 lb of pork/chicken BBQ. We chose chicken, 4 lrg sides, 4 toast  and gallon of tea, $30. Price is not bad at all for what you get. My issue was with BBQ chicken. All they did was cut up their boneless chicken breast and pour a TON of BBQ sauce over it. It did not mimic the pulled pork at all. It was not nasty, but I guess I expected something different. It was flavorless other than the sauce it was drenched in. They could of at least threw the meat on the grill to give it the smoke flavor. If you eat pork and you're thinking of trying the pulled/chopped chicken....DONT! I will go back, I just won't ever venture out from the norm."}
{"text":"Gave me horrible food poisoning. I won't ever go back. Only eat here if you need to loose weight quickly. HA!"}
{"text":"Just had a quick lunch at this location near NorthLake Mall.  You know for a chain BBQ jiont, it is great.  Actually, chain or not it rivals many here in Charlotte.    I had the combo sampler platter with pork, ribs and chicken tenders,  I admit tenders are an odd item for a BBQ place perhaps.  But these are the biggest tenders I have seen.  A choice of sauces or grilled if you prefer.  Very good.  The pork was juicy and tender, the ribs fork tender and full of flavor.  But the ribs seemed to be more steamed or something like that rather than cooked low and slow on a smoker.  Sides were good too.  VERY cheesey M&C.  Yum.  The platter was pretty big too.  Maybe too big for lunch. I'm stuffed.  In and out in 30 minutes with friendly service.    Sure you could find better BBQ joints but this one won't be a bad one any time."}
{"text":"I usually get the pulled pork sandwich. It's good and at a fair price But, they are slow and quite dysfunctional at fixing any problems.  Sort of a \"lost in the forest\" or \"deer in the headlights\" effect if a customer asks them to correct a mistake.  I think management must be focusing intently on some areas and completely ignoring others.  The location north of Phoenix seems to have their act together a little better than this one near Cardinals stadium."}
{"text":"We got a full rack of ribs plate with fries and mac n cheese with two water cups for $22. The ribs were delicious! And the Texas toast was great too! They brought us an extra plate for the bones which was really nice, too. The ribs were tender and the sauce was really great. This restaurant is about half and half a to-go and dine-in kind of place. A fast-food restaurant!"}
{"text":"Best burger in town and friendly staff bbq is really good and not overly priced I would recommend going here if you have never been"}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant last week and we all got sick.  We had stomach cramps for 2 days.  As soon as we left the restaurant,  we felt there was something wrong with the food.  We are never going back."}
{"text":"Excellent service. They took my order really fast and I was nervous because there was quite the line for it being 7:30 pm midweek.  I ordered a full rack of ribs plate with Mac & cheese and hush puppies.   They brought out the wrong order. BUT thankfully they show you your food before they bag it which I LOVE!!! This may sound silly but the girl who bagged my food had a cute southern accent which made the barbecue experience even better. Lol I was upset I didn't have any cash to tip her. Next time.   My ribs fell off the bone they were so so delicious and juicy. I loved the honey BBQ and the original BBQ sauces best out of all the sauces. (I tried all of them). The mac & cheese needed salt and pepper that's a super easy fix. The hush puppies were so on point I don't even know what to say but GET THEM!!! Texas toast was nasty but I just gave it to my dog so overall win hahaha.   It was only $20 which is way cheaper than it would cost me to make it at home. And I ate everything in one sitting so I would recommend the full rack. I have a massive appetite though."}
{"text":"Very awesome! Food was great! I tried the Shack Sampler 'cause when you're gonna try a new BBQ it's go big or go home. The only item I didn't try off the sampler were the chicken tenders...my date ate them.   Service was great, too. The people working were friendly. The guy (don't know his name) bussed our table while we sat around talking.   I'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Wow. I wish I had known about this place two nights ago- I would have wasted a lot less money and time. Food was delivered quickly and piping hot, and the service was fantastic. I am sure the fact that the owners are actively walking the floor and talking to customers has a lot to do with that. I ordered a half-rack and the ribs were literally falling off the bone- I barely had to pick them up. My sides could have been just there for filler and it still would have been a good meal, but the quality of the slaw and beans actually pushed this to a 5 Star review. A+ experience from start to finish. Locals- I assume you know about this joint, but if not, get there ASAP!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Dry pork.  Specials don't save much.  Tea is good. You want some great BBQ, ribs, etc? Go to Hap's BBQ on Washington st. and 52nd st. Next to samurai Sam's."}
{"text":"I have visited this resturant many times and have never experienced any issues except my fries being a little soggy.  I can get past the fries being that it is a BBQ spot.  Their sauces are excellent and the resturant is always clean. The wings and tenders are my favorites and worth the price!  The tenders are huge and all white meat chicken, you can get them naked or with a flavor.  The only down side is price.  It can be on the pricey side for a meal and not the greatest place for those on a budget.  Overall the service is good (it's not a full service spot) you have to get your own drinks and sauces but who cares.  If your in the mood for BBQ and have a couple of dollars...then Shane's will curb your appetite."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss! When it hits, it's the 4th best BBQ in Phoenix, but honestly that's saying quite a bit. 1 - Bryan's 2 - Bobby Q 3- Famous Dave's 4 - Shane's Last - Dickies, Joes Real BBQ, and McD's McRib."}
{"text":"Had lunch again today at the local spot in Gastonia And it was exactly as expected, it was excellent.  The staff are very cordial and our very informed. They keep up with the orders in a timely manner. I ordered the grilled chicken salad as usual and it was excellent.  Look forward to the next time we are able to stop by there for lunch or a early dinner.  The prices or moderate and if you're not very hungry you can also order a child's portion or a kids plate. Their sweet tea is good."}
{"text":"Over all: Good service  Family atmosphere Tasty food  I finally had the time to stand in Shane's ever-present line from outside. I was excited to see what all the hype was all about! I was friendly greeted by the cashier who was very helpful with giving my group recommendations on what to order.  After just a few minutes wait, we took the food to go and eat outside. It was HOT to the touch and messy--everything you expect from barbecue.  The portion sizes we're good and priced reasonably. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the food was delicious, but not the absolute best I've ever had. I'd definitely come back again though!"}
{"text":"I'm happy to be the 1st to review this location.  Very good ribs!  The ribs are meaty and fall right off the bone. Their pork bbq is served with vinegar based sauce if you like that style.  They also have a great selection of sides, try the fried okra, it is excellent!"}
{"text":"The BBQ pork plate here is really good. The sides are OK, I had the baked beans & potato salad...eh. James had the cole slaw...eh.  Really nice friendly service, prices are reasonable. Easy to order and pay then they bring it to your table. The sweet tea is very sweet."}
{"text":"Visited this location for the first time as I was heading to the nearby DMV and just knew I would need to be well fueled for that experience.  That said, well fueled does not necessarily mean well fed when it comes to eating at Shane's.  What I mean by that is, it's a BBQ place obviously but, it's clearly a chain version of the genre.  Nothing at this Shane's or any other location is inherently bad when taken on it's own merits, you just can't start comparing your meal to real BBQ from some local place.  Example.  The pork on my sandwich was plentiful, not fatty and fairly moist.  But, if I'm looking for any bark or trying to taste any smoke flavor I will be left wanting.  While I did not try them this visit, I do think Shane's does a better job on ribs than anything else so would assume that holds true at this location.  Just wish they were spareribs vs. baby backs..."}
{"text":"Shane's is a chain BBQ joint that serves about what you would expect from a chain.  Consistently OK food.  Pluses for the food include, pork that is a good mix of inside moist pork and the outside crunchy bark.  The ribs are fall off the bone tender and have a mildly smokey flavor.  On the minus side is that the pork has very little smoke on it and the consistency makes it seem like it is kept in a steam table as it's a little on the soggy side.  Three of the sauces, regular, hot, spicy, taste about the same and I can't really figure the difference between the hot and the spicy.  All have an overwhelming chili powder taste.  The mustard sauce is a bit on the sweet side for my tastes but not bad overall.    The service at this location is pretty fast and definitely friendly.  At the end of the day, Shane's is a once a year kind of place for me as it takes about that long to forget that it's just ok and not really worth the effort."}
{"text":"the cowboy burger is a great burger- beef ribs excellent, but 3 times now ive been there and they are out of peach cobbler.. saddens my heart"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite before the Coyotes game. No line here, while chipotle across the street was lined up our the door. had my food within 5-10 minutes of ordering. At first i was skeptical of the price for their simplest pulled-pork plate with 2 sides.  After getting my food, I was immediately surprised at how much food was on the plate. Huge serving of meat, Texas toast, and two fair sized sides. Worth it.  Food was good, not amazing. Had a bit of the obvious fast food/QSR taste and quality, but at least pulled pork and barbecue food isn't something you see a lot of in the QSR genre.  I'd eat here again on game night, especially to avoid the lines of the other places."}
