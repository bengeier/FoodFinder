{"text":"It was a disaster. We had reserved for a group of 15 The day before our dinner, someone called the head of our group and advised him that we'd have a fixed menu BC of our size. Fine. A fixed menu should mean a few choices. But instead, when we got there, they told us we were being charged 30$ per head. No discussion. And instead of any choice, they just threw down 10 dishes to share.. Out of those dishes, 9 had meat. Well, three in the group are vegetarian. We immediately explained the situation and asked if we could perhaps switch out some of the dishes to make it more balanced. The ... I'm going to say manager... Flat out refused. Told us his kitchen was inconvenienced by the whole thing. We pointed out that this means that the vegetarian is paying 30$ for a small amount of food....if our group had been informed ahead of time, heck if we had some flexibility, but again it was a flat out refusal. We finally convinced a waitress to try and work something... The manager dude was ignoring us by then. We managed to get some veggie spring rolls, and one other plate to share while the manager glared at us. Ridiculous to charge someone 30$ for 1/10 of what was served. Two people were sick the next day. Service was awful, and most remarked that the food was menh. \"Waysian\" was a term thrown around...Wouldn't set foot back there if you paid me"}
{"text":"This place is one of my new favorites. I would definetetly recommend and will be back no doubt. I tried several dishes (green papaya salad, shrimp cake spring rolls, coconut chicken skewers, mini pancakes, beef and pork in leafs and the chicken wings) and everything was fantastic. My personal favorite were the pancakes was a very original dish.   See you in the summer red tiger :)"}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night for dinner and drinks. It is located in The Village. The place was pretty full and we sat down on the only table available. I am going to list the pros and cons about this place:  PROS: Friendly service Cool interior One of the dishes was ok (a type of beef meatball, can't remember the name)  CONS: Drinks are not great We ordered 4 dishes, and 2 of them were pretty bad, and the other one I couldn't eat it because it was gross.  Slow service Small plates Its quite pricy for the quality of the food Menus were dirty and sticky (I hate sticky menus)  Overall, its not a great place, and I would't come back or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent food!! I had the chicken satay skewers, the Vietnamese shrimp pancakes and the flan, they were all amazing. Nice vibe, the idea is that you get drinks and have a bunch of small sized portions and taste a bit of everything. Very busy place on weekends, reservations recommended."}
{"text":"Petit resto super sympa et j'ai été agréablement surprise par la fraîcheur et la saveur. Nous avons pris un peu de tout et franchement tout était très bon!!"}
{"text":"We tried the grilled chicken In a lemony sauce Excellent  We also ordered beef satay Excellent.  Meat is tender and very well cooked.  Whatever the marinade is, it's awesome.  The dip has ginger in it. I'm ordering more.   And beef carpaccio Yummy yummy yummy, and I usually don't like carpaccio   I also had the lemonade. It's non alcoholic. And it's very refreshing.   We also had shrimp spring rolls They are actually dumplings with the crunchy stuff on the inside.  Dipped in peanut sauce.  Ok But not my favorite so far.   Last, we got the clams, waaay better than mussels  Nice ginger sauce  Love it   This is HAPPY food No sauces to cover up anything. Just plain good food. Well prepared in advance. With lots of veggies.   My mouth is happy And so is my tummy  No feeling like you stuffed yourself with heavy food here.   Love it! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Je suis allé au a restaurant hier soir avec mes'cousins J ai trouvé l'endroit sympa bonne ambiance qui paye pas de mine , jolie et décontracter pas de prise de tête... Niveau service pas de soucis serveur avenant et souriant ... Niveau nourriture tres correct de la bonne bouffe vietnamien qui est quand mm tres bon sans etre excellent... Le seul bemol que je dirais c est que la carte est assez pauvre encore en choix et pas de cocktail sans alcool... A part ca pour conclure restaurant sympa ou on y mange bien avec un rapport qualité prix correct ... Foncer faire un tour ... Et surtout  bon appétit  !!!"}
{"text":"Although I enjoyed the food, the service prevents me from giving this restaurant a five-star review.  This is a popular restaurant, but they did not have enough staff to handle the business.  As a result, orders were late or forgotten.  Drink orders were taken, but they were not served until the meal was over.  I understand that they were busy, but no one likes to feel ignored.  That said, the food was good enough to give it another try, especially given the largely unremarkable choices in the area."}
{"text":"This place has a nice late night vibe and authentic Vietnamese food. We ordered a few things, including a salad, the foetus, the rice cakes, wings, beef rolls, pork ribs, etc. The papaya salad was on point and we finished it all. The foetus was something I had been wanting to try and was a little bit weary. It was ok, tasted like a soft boiled egg but more gamey, I wouldn't eat it again. the banh khot was delicate and a bit sweet, which was quite pleasant. The wings had an epic crunch but i would have liked a bit more sauce. The beef in betel leaves my friends enjoyed, I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor. The braised pork was very good. But my favorite dish had to be the bot chien, rice and taro paste poelee, it reminded me of a breakfast dish but the textures and flavors were amazing"}
{"text":"Décor est très beau. La bière est ordinaire (mais c'est comme au Vietnam). Par contre la bouffe et le service laisse à désirer."}
{"text":"Le Red Tiger est un pub vietnamien situé proche de la station Beaudry. Dès l'arrivée, on peut voir un décor original avec les baguettes dans des boîtes de conserves asiatiques. Il y avait que 3 tables occupées en début de soirée le vendredi. J'ai fais une réservation en ligne juste au cas où. Le menu offre des tapas à partager et les cocktails sont intéressants. J'ai eu un coup de coeur pour le rouleau impérial avec les nouilles et le boeuf, le tout trempé dans un bouillon de Phò. Ce fut une expérience agréable et intéressante qui sort du restaurant typique vietnamien."}
{"text":"This place is a Vietnamese fusion surprise that you should visit. Here are the recommendations:   Their Chicken and beef brochettes have this serious marinade and perfectly grilled.  Beef carpaccio is something here, simply a must !  Shrimp spring rolls are actually a new presentation of dumplings, both soft and crunchy.. Give it a shot.  Clams peeeerfect"}
{"text":"Bel accueil, beau style, excellente cuisine ! Pour une première expérience, c'était réussi ! Bravo !"}
{"text":"Awful service, very slow and way too expensive for what it is. And be ready to get kicked out after 2 hours even if you are a group of 10 people and it took them an hour to start serving your dishes. They won't offer dessert and will not let you finish your drink. You are out before you are ready to be. Don't go."}
{"text":"I was here in March 2017 but I still often think about my meal here.  My family, boyfriend, and I decided to come here for some dinner bites. We had anticipated a wait but we didn't realize how PACKED this place was going to be! That was fine, we showed up and waited despite making a reservation but it was a busy night so we didn't think of it as a big deal.   Nonetheless, we were seated within twenty five minutes or so. We got some menus, ordered some 6-8 different items to split among four people and honestly.... it was all amazing. My mom, the most annoying person ever to take out to eat because of her pickiness and aversion to EVERYTHING, loved everything that she ate!  Mind you, it doesn't help that that she's Cambodian and a lot of Viet and Khmer cooking share similarities but I digress. I'm sorry to say that I don't remember specifically what we ordered as it's been almost ten months but I do remember loving everything we haphazardly picked.   It also brought back many memories as my sister and I usually don't get our mom's cooking anymore, or at least certain recipes, and we were able to try them again here. Biting into something that you vaguely remember tasting and then having that familiarity hit you all at once... The feels, man, the feels.   Also really digged how I was nomming on Southeast Asian bites with my mom and having Ciara's One, Two Step blare throughout a jam-packed restaurant and I sincerely mean that."}
{"text":"After exploring St Joseph Oratory in Mount Royal and Notre Dame Basilica in Old Montreal, we headed to Le Red Tiger near Quartier Latin off Beaudry station for some Vietnamese food. Popularly known for their tapas style fare, I was curious about their lunch menu. We arrived on location with bustling construction at its entrance, but they were still operating as usual.  We seated ourselves at one of the communal tables and reviewed their menu. Options are pretty limited during lunch, so we decided to share a few items. To quench our thirst, my friend had the mango juice while I tried their matcha lemonade. The drinks actually arrived a bit later since their ice machine was broken that day, but it wasn't too long of a wait until ice arrived. The matcha lemonade was tasty and refreshing, the perfect beverage for a hot summer day.  To start, we got the green papaya salad with beef jerky. The salad comes out in a plastic bag where you get to \"toss\" the salad however you like. Once it was mixed to our preference, spritzed a bit of lime juice and added the chili pepper on the side. Pretty good, but I thought it could have used more basil! The sauce (or dressing) is relatively light, so it was quite refreshing as a starter.  For our main, we ordered the rice combo plate with chargrilled pork sausage. Served with a scoop of rice, vegetables and an eggroll, it was an easy portion to share. Fish sauce is incredibly light though and didn't deliver that punch of flavor I have back at home.   Since I was still hungry, my friend and I shared the chargrilled pork spring rolls. It's one giant roll cut in half, but it was stuffed with basil, vegetables and a crunchy middle. They definitely did not skimp on herbs in this one. I debated on ordering another one for the road, but the food was starting to settle so we made our way out before the coma hit.  Overall, it was enjoyable to come through. I would have preferred to hit this spot up at night since their tapas menu appears a bit more expansive, but for what we got, it was great!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, unexpected, good music and cool staff, good ambiance and rad place. Worth the wait, good prices too"}
{"text":"Comme beaucoup je suis toujours sur la réserve lorsque je vais dans un endroit dont on a déjà beaucoup parlé. Un peu méfiant mais très excité à l'idée de découvrir le Red Tiger. Un pub vietnamien, rien que ça !  Je n'ai pas été déçu !!! À l'occasion de la fête de ma blonde nous avons été souper en amoureux. Il est vrai que l'endroit est pas mal bruyant mais agréable. Un service attentionné et de bon conseil.  La carte des cocktails est impressionnante de curiosité tant par les mélanges de saveurs que les ingrédients. J'ai commencé par un BÀ Den Lemonade et ma blonde Ph-jito.  Une très belle présentation et de magnifiques saveurs pour la limonade !  Puis, tellement curieux, nous avons souhaité tester différents mets donc en version plats à partager.  Les saveurs s'enchaînent avec beaucoup de finesse .  Seul déception le plat de crêpes avec lequel nous avons terminé le repas et qui s'est avéré, selon nous, le moins goûteux et le plus lourd. Question d goût !  Nous sommes ressorti cependant rassasiés et heureux de cette première expérience. Envie de goûter à d'autres plats et d'y retourner pour faire découvrir ce lieux sympathique et innovants avec des amis."}
{"text":"Vraiment bien pour le prix. Des saveurs différentes. Une belle option dans le quartier avec de l'ambiance, donc si vous cherchez une place en gang, c'est un bon choix! Tenez vous en aux recommandations des serveurs et vous ne serez pas déçus. Service un peu expéditif mais on ne s'empêche pas de prendre notre temps. Jai bien aime le cocktail que j'ai essayé aussi (me love you)"}
{"text":"Nouvel endroit pour le dîner. Ca commence alors le menu n'est pas tres élaboré encore pour le dîner. Le souper menu complet.   Délicieux et bouffe Viêt traditionnelle (de ce que j'en connais!) A essayer."}
{"text":"What a lovely addition to the neighbourhood. Ok so the food here is REALLY GOOD. Try the salty Vietnamese pancakes! We tried 3-4 things each and everything was good, and food was pretty well priced. The place is lovely and open during the summer.  As for drinks, I found them a bit pricy although very good.  The only problem I have with the place is that taxes are not included in the prices. So, let's say 13$ for a drink is the most I would normally pay for a cocktail. Add tax + tip and you're paying 16 bucks for ONE drink. Ouch. I'll be back for sure but sticking to beer next time."}
{"text":"Franchement, super sympa comme bar, les tapas vietnamiens, spécialités de la maison, sont excellents. J'ai été un peu surprise par le petit piment qui l'air de rien m'a \"set on fire\". Pourtant je ne crains pas les aliments piments et très épicés mais je dois avouer que la ça piquait!! J'ai eu un peu chaud...Pis j'ai eu le droit à mon petit cocktail de fruits à la pastèque sans alcool. Yeahh!!"}
{"text":"Authentic vietnamese food that's fresh, reasonably priced and most important tasty! Great staff and service!!  Try the braised lpork ribs!! Amazing!"}
{"text":"La nourriture est bonne, mais le rapport qualité/prix n'est pas respecté. Effectivement, on mange des plats qui ressemblent aux plats que l'on mange au vietnam, parfois avec un peu moins de goût, un peu trop sucré.   Service : ultra-rapide. On a commandé et eu nos plats en un temps éclair. Ils ont oublié un plat, mais on ne leur tient pas rigueur. Personnel très sympathique. On n'a moins aimé assisté à un serveur qui refuse d'aller chercher des bols pour le barman.   Ambiance : belle ambiance, en plein été, c'est une belle énergie qui en est dégagé. La porte de garage ouverte ouvre l'espace. Bonne place pour aller fêter et boire avec des amis.   Prix : un peu cher pour ce que c'est. Honnêtement, c'est des plats qui ressemblent parfois à ce que ma mère fait, mais par un prix qui n'est pas justifié. Il y a des restaurants dont le goût est plus authentique et que le rapport qualité prix est meilleur (my canh, banh xeo Minh), mais je dois avouer que l'ambiance n'est pas la même.  À essayer une fois. Mais pour le même prix, je préfère de loin une place comme Imadake (japonais) qui offre une meilleure cuisine, avec de meilleurs produits."}
{"text":"First time having Vietnamese tapas! Great little find tucked away in the village. We got about 3 tapas each and it was plenty of food. Cocktails were all so tempting!"}
{"text":"Essai cocktail pendant la semaine Invasion Cocktail au Red Tiger. Le lieu est sympa, un peu exiguë, il ne faut pas trop traîner dans les espaces de passages sous peine de se faire bousculer par les serveuses pressées.  J'ai goûté un des cocktails spécialement crée pour la semaine à base de rhum, il était pas mal, bien dosé. Pas une grosse explosion de saveurs mais sympa. Les plats que j'ai goûté était sympa, la salade de papaye verte est bonne. Cependant elle est servie dans un sac en plastique qu'il faut secouer et dont on ajuste nous même l'assaisonnement (citron vert et piment). Je trouve que le sac plastique est vraiment inutile, des déchets pour pas grand chose selon moi."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend on a Friday night - was definitely the place to be! Red Tiger is like a hipster, tapas style take on Vietnamese food. Luckily, we made reservations beforehand, otherwise we probably would have had trouble getting a table. Their cocktail list is awesome and had a decent laugh over the puns in the names. Food was good too, although a little pricey for what it is. Would definitely come back for drinks"}
{"text":"Pas mal mais mon expérience a considérablement été entachée par l'emplacement de notre table!  Et la, j'espère que si vous envisagez de tester ce restaurant, vous lirez ma revue avant de vous installez à cette table....je parle de la petite table de deux personnes située juste à l'entrée du restaurant à droite!  Si on vous la propose....refusez....sous peine de ressortir du restaurant rassasié mais très malade! On sent tous les courants d'air et pendant tout le repas on est obnubilé par le rideau que les gens qui entrent tirent mais ne remettent pas et qui l'hiver laisse s'engouffrer un froid glacial!"}
{"text":"Resto vietnamien super bon et sympa. Plats styles  tapas idéal pour partager en couple ou entre amis. Prix très raisonnable. Plein de vietnamiens dans le resto donc c'est bon signe."}
{"text":"Three star food with a zero star service. Waited 20min for one dish, finally was forgotten. Waitress didn't even apologize. Bad overall experience. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for a while. Atmosphere is hip and trendy , a nice change from the usual vietnamese resto. Noise level is high so definitely not the the spot for a quiet tête-à-tête.  I had gone with a friend. Pretty busy night but the wait staff were very attentive and helpful in their suggestions. Ordered the lemongrass beef skewers, shrimp cake spring rolls, tamari soft shell crab and coconut mini pancakes. Everything was flavorful and well seasoned although the spring roll was a bit stingy on the shrimp. You'll find better in a more traditional viet place. Had both the flan and chè for dessert. Both pretty tasty but a bit heavy on the coconut cream.  Overall fun experience and a refreshing modern take on viet food"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant/cocktail places I've been! Staff was super friendly and fun, music was great and food was AMAZING. 10/10 would reccomend for anyone in Montreal!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! A hip slant on traditional Vietnamese food.  Great service and amazing food. Highly recomended."}
{"text":"i HATE giving poor reviews but this experience was totally inexcusable. I told server about my peanut allergy and all dishes came topped with peanuts. when i told the busser she told me i should of told them i had an allergy and rolled her eyes, absolutely no apology.  ordered the wings which were way too sweet and totally dry"}
{"text":"AMAZING! A must go! Chicken wings, beef and pork rolled in betel leaves and the ribs are a MUST!"}
{"text":"Très bon bar et restaurant vietnamien, avec plein de spécialités en mode tapas à partager! La bière est ok, il y a de tout il me semble (blonde, rousse, etc), les cocktails avaient l'air super originaux et bons,  et tout ce que j'ai pu voir passer, que ce soit à manger ou à boire, avait l'air super bon! Nous avons testé les wontons frits, le carpaccio, les ailes de poulet et les escargots, et tout était vraiment très bon! Seul petit hic: ça fini par revenir un peu dispendieux au total.. A essayer à tout prix!"}
{"text":"For a pub, this place sure is on the pricier side. The food is good though, and very authentic (my Vietnamese friend approved). You sit on plastic chairs and all, the real atmosphere of a street food joint. Cocktails names were hilarious (Halong Bae, anyone?), and frankly delicious.  Gets very loud by 10pm or so (they turn up the music and turn down the lighting, which is dim to begin with). Nice place to hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"Stayed in an airbnb upstairs, visiting from the States for the Grand Prix. Glad it was immediately downstairs, as we went straight there for drinks and dinner from the plane. Great vibe, europop setting but not in a douchey way.  The garage door that opens really set it off. Food was good, and it was cooked in an open kitchen. Drinks were better, and the bartenders were friendly and nice. Andrew the bartender knows what he's doing.  I hope the owners keep an eye out and promote the man! Will stop by next time I'm in Montreal and see how they're doing."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The flavors are on the sweet side but since I like sweet, it was all very delicious. I particularly liked the sweet potato and shrimp fritters. It was crunchy, with a really well balanced hot mayo sauce. I also enjoyed the pho beef spring roll. It was basically a spring roll cut in three pieces, served in a bowl with pho soup at the bottom. An interesting twist and again there was a crunchy element in it, which I liked a lot. The hip retro decor is nice, very friendly service. The drinks were good also, I had the taya (a drink with pitaya though i didn't see any pitaya pieces in it). I saw some adventurous items on the menu such as stir fried escargot and conch brochettes, maybe I'll try them next time."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Upon walking in we were greeted by our waitress and seated. The first glance at the menu was a little daunting but our waitress was quick to explain everything and suggest a tapas style of ordering, first service salads and cold dishes and second service hot dishes. They have a fun selection of cocktails and also different Asian beers to choose from.   Plates were brought out in record time. We were there on a Monday so I assume they are used to a rush and a crazy turn-over because it did feel pretty fast.   All the food was great, stand-outs for me were the wings (very simple light seasoning but cooked to perfection) and the shrimp spring roll (soft, crunchy, cilantro-y) absolutely fantastic. The dipping sauce for the spring rolls was so good I kept in the whole meal and dipped almost everything in it.   Another winner was the traditional coffee. Served on ice with a condensed milk this was the perfect end to a great meal.   A+ on the service, food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice little Vietnamese pub near the village. We went there for lunch on a friday before it got very busy so managed a nice little table spot. Had the papaya salad - which is brought to you in a bag, shake it, shake it - shrimp spring rolls and a banh mi pork sandwich. Everything was absolutely deelicious and just enough food to fill your lunch stomach. Service was friendly. My only down point would be the level of the music as I don't particularly enjoy having to shout to talk to my lunch buddy - but really that's just the matter of a button-push!"}
{"text":"I came here with my start up team because we wanted to go for Vietnamese food, and my friend had recommended me to try Red Tiger. I saw the food pics on Yelp and was sold! I've called in advance for a table of 5 at 7pm, and fortunately, they were really accommodating.   Good: The interior was casual and inviting. The food was decent, but nothing out of the ordinary for me. I think the effort was there, they served the papaya salads in a bag, which is like street food style in Vietnam.   Bad: The portions were much to small for my liking (this is why I dislike tapas restaurants/bars). I felt more and more ripped off with every plate that arrived at my table, because the food taste no more different than the traditional Vietnamese restaurants I go to, for half the price. I felt like I was paying double the price for half the portion. Our bill came out to nearly $200 for 5 people (if my Vietnamese dad finds out, I can just imagine him shaking his head in disbelief.)  Our waitress then comes to tell us that we have to leave soon for a large table coming in at 9pm. This is something that should've been mentioned earlier, not 15 minutes before expecting another group. We had to let her know that some of our dishes haven't even arrived yet, which she later punched in the order. At one point, I even had to ask another waiter if our order is on it's way because it took a bit long. The staff was very friendly, but also seemed a bit disorganized.   Bottom Line: Cool looking place, decent food, overall sub par experience, but I don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"An unpretentious, casual restaurant-bar with terrific food. I've been here a few times and after sampling a good portion of the menu I can attest that the food does live up to the hype!  My favorite dish was the mini pancakes (banh khot). I was sitting at the bar yesterday and was mesmerized by how much care the chef put in making them. He patiently pampered them until they were crispy all around yet bouncy on the inside. The pancakes were topped with a mixture of ground pork and shrimp and sweetened with coconut milk. They were then ready to be dunk in a homemade fish sauce; a real treat! You get six mini pancakes in one portion; I shared everything tapas-style but I could have easily finished the plate on my own.  Another highlight was the beef carpaccio. In contrast with its Italian counterpart, the Vietnamese version is really heavy on the lime juice (which I love). There's also no raw egg in this version, just a lot of crispy fried shallots and peanuts.   Red Tiger offers spring rolls rolled in square (pretty cool!) rice paper and filled with either a shrimp or pork sausage, or tofu. I tried the non-vegetarian options and liked it, but wasn't wowed by it. The addition of what seemed to be fried egg wrapping paper was a nice touch since it added dimension to the roll, though. If you are craving meat, I'd definitely recommend ordering the fried chicken wings or skewers. They are a must!  My only complaint would be that the cocktails, while good, seemed watered down and didn't deliver the same punch as the food.  Overall, it's a good place to come to if you want to dance to 80-90's music on your bar stool and indulge in a type of cuisine we rarely come across in Montreal. It's open late too, which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Music and Vietnamese. What more can you ask for. The place has a great vibe and party atmosphere. Make reservations especially on Friday and Saturday nights or you might be waiting a long time for a table.   This is for when you get tired of pho. I think my party tried about 7 or 8 different dishes. You need about 2-3 per person, which I originally thought would be too much but actually just right.   Definitely order the fried pork and shrimp wonton. Also the fried pancake that your wrap in leaves is excellent.   Cocktails are very good too. Nguyen cup and the me love you long time are great."}
{"text":"The good and the oh so bad. The good: everything was yummy (for me) The bad: my date was deathly allergic to peanuts and fish and made it very clear to the waitress, unfortunately the kitchen didn't care as much and kept dousing all of our orders with peanuts... And him having taken a bite out of something and then her coming over and going \"omg don't eat that they put peanuts!\"  It happened 3 times and they kept having to bring us new dishes.  Luckily he did not die! Update: he did have an allergic reaction after leaving the restaurant. This was on their anniversary night so it was extremely busy however they could've killed him, and then that would have been a good headliner for their anniversary party....  Overall yes I would go back there myself, however it would have been nice to be compensated on the bill considering he could have died!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now at le Red Tiger and is never disappoints. Service is good. Food was so fresh and tasty and drinks are really good. Order the crepes, the skewers, the spring rolls and the carpaccio. Each one is simple but so flavorful. As for drinks, get the Phuc Dat Bich or the Me Love You Long Time. The vibe there is pretty cool and laid back. It's pretty intimate  Music is good too."}
{"text":"Started good, ended bad.   My boyfriend and I came in after a concert and right as the kitchen was about to close but the host was really accommodating and made sure that we got our order in. That was where the good service ended.   Our waitress visited the table once to ask for our orders and then we didn't see her again until she was taking a shot with the table next to ours. My bf's food came out 10 minutes before mine and then we were basically ignored. We asked twice for our check, once to the host who said he would take care of it only to pass it off and start chatting with someone at the bar, and once to the waitress who had received the task but was busy socializing behind the bar.   The staff really needs to get it together. I get it, it's the end of the night, why not enjoy a drink or two since it's a lively atmosphere, but don't forget about your other customers who may not be drinking and just want some good food.   Thanks for the good food, but your service sucked."}
{"text":"J'y suis retourné dernièrement avec des irréductibles de la place...et mon opinion reste inchangé.  Plats qui ressemblent vaguement à de la cuisine vietnamienne...et encore, de la cuisine de tous les jours de ma mère. Lorsque je sors, je m'attends à des goûts plus recherchés...alors de la sauce de poisson partout... La cuisine vietnamienne est tout en fraicheur et finesse. Je persiste à dire que cette place est pour les non-initiés.  Au même prix je recommande, les places de \"pho\" plus traditionnelles, mais certes avec moins d'ambiance."}
{"text":"Super endroit! Bons petits plats viet différents de ce à quoi je suis habituée, service efficace alors que nous étions un grand groupe, et ambiance festive sans que la musique ne soit trop forte."}
{"text":"Really nice place to bring a date or to have a 5à7with coworkers. The staff is nice, the food is really good and the drinks are affordable. The decor is kind of vintage and so is the music which makes the place fun to stay at. It doesn't feel like authentic vietnamese food but it's close enough to satisfy my cravings for it!"}
{"text":"So good. So delicious. We had 7 items off the menu and they were all delicious. Drink was SO good. (Gin, first one on the menu). Will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Papaya salad and beef soup are very tasty, spring rolls are also good, this is a good choice for supper, like the food in this shop, their attendants are also very good. I always want to try other foods again."}
{"text":"It was our first time in this establishment and Andrew and Dominic were the most gracious bartenders and hosts .  We got a few seats at the bar on a busy Friday night .They were extremely hospitable, attentive and informative in regards to the food and drinks .  Overall...the food was on point , drinks superb , staff super friendly , and the overall vibe was very cool , energetic without being overwhelming .  Thank you all for a memorable first night in Montreal.  X"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying Red Tiger for a while. I love Vietnamese food and was looking to try a different take on the cuisine (as opposed to the typical pho place - although dont get me wrong I love pho lol). I decided with my friends to finally check out Red Tiger...and I have to say it was just ok...The service wasn't the best. We ordered one round of drinks and the waiter ended up forgetting our second order of drinks (we just ended up canceling them it was too long of a wait). It was a busy night but the drinks were not the only thing that was forgotten. When it comes down to the food, it was again just ok. We tried a lot on the menu; I got the vietnamese shrimp pancakes which were delicious, it was the star choice of the evening. My friends were not in love with any of their choices. I would not organize to go back there based on my first experince, but if another person wanted to go grab a drink (the drinks were very good espcially the bourbon drink) there and get some viet pancakes I would not oppose. Overall wish my experience was better but willing to give a second."}
{"text":"The drinks here were great and the service was as well, but in terms of the food I would have to say it wasn't good at all. We were a large group and tried almost everything on the menu and I'm really sad to say that nobody enjoyed what they were eating... Vietnamese food is my favourite cuisine and I eat it all the time. So a bar serving Vietnamese food got me really excited. Unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype food wise. On the upside, it's a great atmosphere, great decor and amazing service so at least there's that! But unfortunately I would never eat there again. If you want to go to a Vietnamese bar, I would recommend Cafe den. It's a little more fancy than a pub, but the cocktails are wonderful the service is fantastic and the food is impeccable."}
{"text":"On m'avait présenté ça comme l'endroit à tester ... Alors soit je ne suis pas le public visé, soit j'ai des goûts vraiment différents mais je n'ai tout simplement pas aimé. Pourtant, aux vues de la carte, ça s'annonçait bien, des prix abordables et un choix varié. Mais non, ça ne l'a pas fait avec moi. Les beignes de crevettes et les banhs par exemple étaient extrêmement fades, les rouleaux impériaux n'avaient rien de spécial, le carpaccio de boeuf était plus que décevant. Bref, seules les brochettes de poulets au satay et coco ne m'ont pas déçues.  De plus, notre table étaient proches de l'entrée et donc du rideau qui servait de SAS et où, dès que quelqu'un rentrait (et la plus part des gens semblent ne pas savoir qu'un rideau ça fonctionne comme une porte que l'on ouvre et que l'on ferme une fois qu'on est passé hein...) on se prenait un énorme coup de froid très peu agréable.  Je mets 2 étoiles parce que le personnel est tout même sympa.  Honnêtement, je ne comprends pas l'engouement pour cette place et personnellement, je n'ai pas l'intention d'y retourner."}
{"text":"Cette fin de semaine j'ai fait une belle decouverte. En fait cela fait plus un an et demi que je voulais essayer ce restaurant j'avais eu de bon commentaires et le menu m'intriguait enormement. J'avais également vu lepisode de curieux begin et je dois dire que ca mavait donner l'eau a la bouche. Je suis pas particulierement dfan de nourriture viet, je crois quil a trop de resto de ce type a montreal et certain sont tres ordinaires.... mais j'aimais l'idee de \"street food\" viet. J'avais de très bonne attente envers ce restaurant et je dois avouer que j'ai passé l'une de mes meilleures soirée depuis un mechant bout!   Premièrement j'ai appelé vendredi a 16h pour avoir une réservation pour 6 personne pour le soir même et jai reussi a avoir pour 21h. Mes amis sont arriver en retard malheureusement et le staff on ete super fin de pas me faire sentir mal de monopoliser une table quand il avait un line up de gens qui attendaient.  Dans notre groupe, on etait 5 personnes a vouloir essayer le menu en formule tapas. On s'est laissé  guider par notre serveur pour les plats. On a eu une belle variété de plats, 11 au total, tous les uns plus bons que les autres. J'ai ete agréablement surprise par les saveurs proposé ainsi que le melange de texture en bouche. Je dois avouer jai eu un gros coup de coeur. Les beignets de crevette sur canne a sucre, les brochettes de boeuf a la citronelle, le carpaccio de boeuf ainsi que la salade de papaye au boeuf c'était juste malade!!!   Un tres beau menu de cocktail aussi. Des ingrédient surprenants, alcool en bonne quantité et choix de \"pimper\" notre alcool pour un extra. On s'est fait offrir un super bon shooter \"red tiger\"  par le proprio.  Le service était excellent. Le staff est agréable et sait comment faire passer une bonne soiree a ces clients. Le choix de musique 80-90 tombe totalement dans mes gouts et j'ai meme chanter des classiques avec les cooks. Une super ambiance de feu ahhaha ;) et que dire des prix. La formule tapas nous a permis d'essayer pleins de plats et tout cela pour environ 20$ ce qui est ridicule.   A la fin de la soiree mon amis cest fait lancer le challenge de manger le foetus d'oeuf par le staff et mon autre ami 10 minute apres cest decide aussi a le faire et meme si la cuisine etait fermée depuis, le staff etait super et ont preparer un 2eme oeuf pour mon ami juste pour le trip de le voir manger cette spécialité.  Je recommencerais l'expérience n'importe quand et je recommande a tout le monde qui on envi dessayer quelque chose de nouveau."}
{"text":"So much fun! We rolled in without reservations and they found us a spot at the bar. The Old Fashioned I started with was big and strong and had a unique twist and a kick. The service was so friendly and funny and helpful. Food came out fast and it was top notch bar food. No pho here, this is all delicious Vietnamese pub style stuff. Chicken wings were great, satays were tasty, pork rice flour little crepes were nice but not as good as my friend's dad makes (c'est normal). Ribs were super flavourful but a little tough. All in all we ate well, we ate tons, and it was fairly reasonable on the wallet given the fun trendy bar vibes."}
{"text":"This is the first 5/5 review I'm giving on Yelp.  I've been to Vietnam five times in my life, and this is the very first time a Vietnamese restaurant (outside of Vietnam) has impressed me so much. The food tastes very fresh and along with the cocktails, they were refreshing.   I went with a group of seven, made resos online. We shared a ton of plates as it's very tapas style. Their beef carpaccio, bot chien, and papaya salad were so good. Every plate we tried reminded me of the food I had in Vietnam.  I'm so glad this restaurant covered different types of Vietnamese food and it was cool to see my friends learn a lot more about our food besides the standard pho bowls we are notoriously known for.  From the impeccable service to the welcoming interiors, Le Red Tiger absolutely impressed me so much. As a Vietnamese, I highly recommend this place whether you live here or are travelling, come eat here asap!!!  Easy to find street parking around here and it is a little on the pricier side so it's more worthwhile to go with a huge party, that way you can try everything like we did!"}
{"text":"This place is exceptional!! First of all I'm from Houston TX and we have one of the largest Vietnamese community in the US.  Which means, Vietnamese food is abundant and pretty darn good. So I was visiting my friend in Montreal and she decided to take me to a Vietnamese restaurant. At first I was reluctant to go, but I decided to give it a shot and see what Montreal had to offer. So I went with an open mind and palate and tried not to be biased.  We came on a Saturday night and it was packed! We we're lucky enough to get a table without waiting. Our waiter was super friendly. I was really impressed with the decor and ambiance. We started with the escargot cooked in coconut milk and it was awesome!  I had a beer and my friend got a girly cocktail which was a bit strong but very good!  One of my favorites was the beef wrapped in leaves (bò lá lot), very authentic! I got the bún bò hue which was one of my favorite dishes when I traveled back to Vietnam. The flavors were remarkable, the combination of the spices and the all aromas brought me back to Vietnam lol. The chicken dish was very well executed, everything was right. At that point, I was getting full but we decided to go for one more appetizer and ordered (banh khot) which was some delicious mini pancakes with shrimp. It was delectable. Vietnamese comfort street food at it's best!! Vietnamese cuisine has simple dishes but yet extremely complex. A century of french domination had impacted in a good way this culture and it shows in it's cuisine. Red Tiger gives respect and represents this cooking style very well! My only request is that they constantly come up and create more dishes. There's a lot of Vietnamese food out there that deserves to be introduced. Overall this restaurant was a pleasant surprise for me. Cool concept, very good food with no pretentions. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Very good Vietnamese. We had papaya salad and phô. Lovely shrimp broth. Menu is limited at lunch. The food was simple and disciplined. However, due to Canadian palates, some things were missing ie the Nam Pla, some real chilis in vinegar and the phô could have used some red basil on the side with the bean sprouts. The waitress made a huge deal out of the 1/8th of a teaspoon of chili garlic sauce on the plate. We found le deuxieme monde chic decor quite precious. It must look nice at night."}
{"text":"Nice vibe and people, but food took FOREVER to arrive (around 50 minutes!!) for such small portions! We weren't impressed by the food either. I had the fried wontons.. you get about 4 measly pieces for 6$. The \"sticky rice\" dish hardly had any rice in it. The snails took such hard work to eat and were super greasy.. it was a difficult time Lol. For drinks, I tried the \"Me Love you Long Time\" drink that has fresh watermelon in it which was tasty.  FYI The place is really loud at night (full of people and music is blasting) but I was still able to maintain a conversation without screaming.  The decor is nice and the location isn't too far to be inconvenienced. But we were not convinced to come back. Sorry!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a different experience, definitely go there!  The flavors are unique and exotic just like they positioned themselves....as street style Vietnamese food. Very happy that I tried there! Honestly, it is interesting and different.   I can imagine this is a great place if you want to impress your date.  But I have a love and hate relationship with this place....and here is the true truth:   Was the food good? YES! Was it an interesting experience overall? YES! Was the food overpriced? YES! Was the ambience and the vibe hipster-cool-pretentious? YES! Do I feel totally out of place? YES Will I go there again? YES Will I feel stupid again after spending that much money for tiny portion food and low budget setup? YES"}
{"text":"I have to give this little restaurant a five star! The food, drinks and atmosphere are incredible. I'm Vietnamese, was born and raised in Vietnam, so I know what is authentic Vietnamese food tastes like. And, this place hit every single taste buds! If you are looking for authentic Vietnamese food, beside Pho, you have to go here!"}
{"text":"I came close to not writting my review because it's hard enough as it is to score a place.  Reservations are highly recommended especially during the weekend! Then again, what else do you expect when the food is  not only authentic but also unbelievably good. The dishes are chock-full of flavor thanks to the many herbs and spices that are used.   I highly recommend the papaya salad with beef jerky - this is not your run of the mill papaya salad,trust me! The beef skewers with lemongrass and the beef tartare are a MUST! Also,whatever you do, please leave room for deserts, you won't regret it.  The drinks are really worth it, they don't skimp on the booze which is refreshing in a city where most of the drinks are watered down (seriously what is wrong with the alcohol dosage in montreal!).   If you haven't been to red tiger yet, you are seriously missing out!!"}
{"text":"A visit to Vietnam with a wonderful tour guide ,Chris, who made it quite easy to enjoy samplings from this very tantalizing menu - easily recommend anything here - and Chris good luck on your competition!"}
{"text":"I visited this place to celebrate my brother's birthday. I wanted to try it out ever since seeing the place on TV. My expectations were kind of high since I had been anticipation my visit for a while. I am happy to say that the restaurant is worth all the hype surrounding it.   We ate 6 plates in total and I have to say that my favorite of the bunch was the Bôt chiên A good thing to know is that my brother is allergic to peanuts. They were really nice about accommodating the plates for us and letting us know each time they were serving us that it was, in fact, peanut free.   We were seated at the bar and the service was amazing. The bartender was really nice.  I definitely plan on going back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and staff! Dominique is the man!! Definitely give this place a try. Very Knowledgeable staff and very friendly. Music was very on point!"}
{"text":"Very pleased. I was expecting a fancier pub vibe but seriously, everything was delish! Drinks are great.. food was amazing... staff is super friendly. I can't wait to go back...  you need to try this place out.... NOW.......... did you go yet???"}
{"text":"Had a great time here last night. We had the oysters in sauce, beef and chicken skewers, mini crepes. All delicious. I am so excited to try the grilled quail and beef carpaccio next time!  My friend and I sat by the bar and got to check  out the bad ass moves of the very amicable bartender.  It's a bit loud but that's also a sign that people are having a good time!"}
{"text":"First i would like to say that i can be picky when it comes to food. I think its important to be able to criticize as well as complimenting; how else would you expect a business to get better without reviews?   Red tiger's decoration is not your typical fob vietnamese pub/restaurant. Its very retro and well targeted for its location- not fancy but has a twist of hispter vibe.  The staff there are very friendly and make sure your food and drinks are always at your satisfaction- they genuinely want to know your opinion!   Portions are not 'chinatown' size. You should expect 9-12$ tapas (from what i can remember).  My boyfriend and i came there to celebrate my birthday and we've ordered pretty much everything on the menu. I would say the flavors are really on point and doesn't necessarily taste 'westernize'; they also serve balut! My favorite dish would be the beef carpaccio, i would rate 5 stars for that dish. I live 30mins away from this restaurant, and i would drive back for that dish.   The drinks are yummy, and definitely not 'weak'- you can actually taste the alcohol. Unlike SOME other places where you just taste the juice- sorry, i didnt pay 12$ for juice. So dont worry, drinks are yummy and make sure Jeremy (i think thats his name?) makes your drinks!   This is a pub/restaurant but later in the night everyone just hangs out at the bar and drinks all night.  Overall i am impressed with this restaurant considering who they are targeting. The flavors are accurate and on point. The drinks are strong. The vibe is chill.   I'll definitely bring my friends there and throw a party."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Montreal. Been there so many times and I have never been disappointed! I grew up in a Vietnamese-Chinese household so a lot of these dishes remind me of home and my upbringing.   Decor and atmosphere : it uses a lot of stuff that reminds you of Vietnamese street food stands such as the chopsticks and old cans as utensils holders on the table. You can definitely feel the Viet vibes through the wall decor as well and the neon lighting above the bar. Love the open kitchen concept. However it can get very loud later in the evening.   Service: yes yes, the partners of this restaurant are hipster Vietnamese guys but don't be fooled! The service is great. No one being uptight or judgy. They explain to you the tapas system and food when you ask them.   Food: my favourite category. A lot of flavour and authentic as well. If I could, I would lick the plates clean. Okay fine! You guys caught me! I may have used my finger to clean the plate once. Or twice. Yes, it's that good. My favourite dishes are the snails, the raw beef salad, the mini crepes, the spring rolls. I haven't tried the pho spring roll but whoever orders that will never be my friend. That's a blasphemy.   Drinks: very tasty and refreshing. I appreciate it when they give you a list of different liquor they have. For example if you order a gin based drink, they let you choose which gin to add in your drink. I know you can do that at any bar but it's just a nice touch. The cute names don't hurt either.  Just go, trust me."}
{"text":"OK, this place is always rocking on the weekend. Why?  Because it is a great venue, deco and summertime patio. And great drinks for the beginning of night out and really great eats. But don't get me wrong this place is also a destination if you want a chill, cool night of drinks and food with a great atmosphere make sure to try it out. Enjoy."}
{"text":"They have a small menu but when I got there, they didn't have any choices in the soup dishes.  So I opted for the papaya salad. O M F G. This dish is a REQUIREMENT. You cannot leave Montreal without ordering this dish. It is the best I've ever had...and my family is from Southeast Asia!  I like that it is presented in a plastic bag. Very authentic street vendor style, but not very eco-friendly, guys.  The bag was a necessity on the streets, but not here. Need to rethink that one.  Plus it's not very manageable trying not to get fish sauce on your hands.  Trust me you don't want fish sauce on your hands.  So just dump it out on the small metal plate they bring your plastic bag on.  The beef jerk was actually tender and delicious. Everything was just magical. So glad I stopped in for a quick bite.  Do yourself a favor...you have not had papaya salad until you've had it here."}
{"text":"OMG!  I had heard so much about Montreal's international food scene, so I was pumped to try some Vietnamese food.  These were very creative dishes, very fresh and healthy."}
{"text":"This place is the so good. The service was excellent and the interior was so chill. Loved everything we ordered because this spot is actually had many vegetarian dishes. We ordered all of them cause we were so hungry. Only one dish we didn't like were the crepes, but it's only because the other dishes were so excellent.   Oh and the cocktails. YUMMY! You should totally go here. I wouldn't go in a large group cause it's a narrow restaurant. I'd say a group of six would be the max. Four would be perfect. And intimate enough for a date."}
{"text":"(Some) Vietnamese street food dishes (because not all the dishes are street food fare) paired with an awesome cocktail menu that sport hilarious names is definitely a winner for a little pre-drinking and dancing night out w friends. I've tried a few of their drinks and was never disappointed.  The food is good and fun, not your typical Vietnamese joint which is also a very good thing once in a while.  I have been back many times and would still go back :)"}
{"text":"This is very trendy Vietnamese pub, always busy during the week. The food is pretty amazing and the cocktails are on point."}
{"text":"I love the cool concept and all, but the execution fell short. I've been wanting to check Le Red Tiger every time I visit Montréal, but that's what happened when you have high expectations for something.   Vietnamese food on the menu looks pretty legit, but if an Asian person had trouble eating the snails, I don't think, non-Asians would even bother eating them. It was impossible to get the snail meat out of many of them with the provided toothpicks. I've eaten snails before at other restaurants and they were always easier to remove the meat!  We ordered Chicken Wings, Snails, Beef and Pork Wrapped in Betel Leave, sticky rice with shredded pork, sausage, etc and chicken and shrimp imperial roll.   Chicken wings were good, albeit a little tiny for the price. The beef and pork betel leafs were ok, not great. The sticky rice dish was a heaping mess of different meats. It would be better to separate everything to make it nicer presentation and easier to assemble a tasty bite.  I had indigestion and vomited on the same night. Service was a little lackluster as our waiter tried to force us to take the wrong order from own mistake. We were strongly encouraged to take the vegetarian imperial roll that he put in by mistake instead of the chicken and shrimp roll which he claimed after the fact was sold out....so why didn't you give me the option to change before you cooked something I didn't order??? It was boring and tasteless.   Needless to say I would never recommend this restaurant nor would I eat here ever again."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fun atmosphere. 80s/90s music piped through the resto, full on a Saturday night. We ordered the shrimp cakes spring roll, braised pork ribs, tofu in tomato sauce and the grilled eggplant with shallots and ginger. Everything was delicious.  I also ordered the pi-taya cocktail -- it was so tasty and refreshing that I wondered if there was actually any booze in it! (I'm sure there was, but it was just so good...)  Loud and full of people, which contributes to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs resto que je suis aller en 2017. Un ancien decor Vietnam/ full contemporain. Le menu est + que bon. Les cocktail sont excellent. Cote de boeuf à prendre, il n'y a pas de bao  9/10"}
{"text":"J'ai adoré ce restaurant! Plusieurs plats me faisaient penser à des plats goutés lors d'un voyage au vietnam. Nous étions un groupe et bien que les serveurs ont pris au moins 30 minutes pour nous emporter les premières bières et drinks commandés, le reste de la soirée s'est déroulée parfaitement. Le serveur était présent, le service était rapide. Le restaurant ferme à 3h le samedi donc une ambiance festive s'installe en soirée (il faudrait définitivement avoir des speakers qui sonnent plus fort par contre).  Le menu est de style tapas vietnamien. Les deux plats que j'ai commandé étaient parfaitement delicieux: Wontons frits au porc et crevette et Carpaccio de boeuf."}
{"text":"red tiger looks like a run of the mill pub on the outside but the food and cocktails were so much more. the dishes are served tapas style and in a large group (30 people) we had the opportunity to try most things on the menu - the wings and chicken skewers were a favorite. they also had a variety of tropical drinks and beers on tap. the music and vibe were also great - will be back!"}
{"text":"Belle ambiance, les cocktails sont bons  mais je n'y retournerais pas...Nous avons commandé 6 plats et la moitié d'entre eux étaient plutôt décevants..."}
{"text":"Tres bonne place pour manger des tapas vietnamienne. Un pub vietnamien, une idee originale et on est pas déçu! Bon accueil, les cocktails sont tres bons tout comme les tapas! Une clientèle d'habitués donc pas mal d'attente. Je recommande"}
{"text":"This is a lovely cute joint to grab a quick lunch or enjoy a beer with friends. I love their simple but relaxing atmosphere and the bar where you can chat with your friends and watch your lunch being prepared in front of you. The prices are very budget friendly and this place won´t break the bank. Their vegetarian deep fried rolls are pretty good too! Can´t wait to come back there in the evening to grab a beer with friends."}
{"text":"Service: The restaurant was really busy, so the waiter asked us if we wanted to be seated at the bar and we agreed. At the bar, the barman was in charge of our service. Even though he was really busy with making drinks, he still offered a pretty good service, and even gave us shots. He also knew the menu really well and was able to answer our questions. Score: 5/5  Food: We had the chicken skewers, the egg with a dead phoetus inside (I know it may sound disgusting, but it is really good), the snails and the pork ribs. Honestly, evrything we had was amazing. The only thing that was disapointing was the white rice, which was a bit too watery.  Score: 4.5/5  Drinks: The Red Tiger had a drink menu created just for them. Every drink is very original and has an asian twist. The names are also very original. If you are not too sure what to drink, the barman will be more than happy to counsel you.  Score: 5/5  Ambiance: The restaurant is really small, but has a nice athmosphere to it. Some of the dishes are served in plastic bags, such as the salad, which gives a street food ambiance. The owners decided to destroy one of the walls to install a glass door that can be lifted up, which is really nice. Overall, I loved the ambiance. Score: 5/5  Dish you MUST order: The ribs, please do not leave without trying them"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Super trendy and great ambiance. Make sure to reserve as the restaurant is not the biggest place. Their cocktail menu has great options (that are all so gooooood!) and it's fun to see that the cocktails each have fun names referring back to vietnamese culture  The food menu is a sharing menu you can split with your friends. Decently priced and so yummy! I recommend the papaya salad and their skewers! Yum. The atmosphere is upbeat and a great place to catch up with friends or to go on a date night with your s/o. They recently announced that on Saturdays they will remain open till 3am so that's a big win! RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"I'm totally biased - friends with the owners and LOVE Vietnamese food.   This place is arguably the spot that made Vietnamese street food hot and trendy in MTL. Everything here is best eaten with your hands, and shared (but I'd understand if you don't want to). Spring rolls, Che (traditional dessert), satay skewers and pork sausages - all of your favourite Viet dishes are here.  The vibe is fun, the staff is great. To see the entire menu - check out the vlog https://youtu.be/jdPzNq17_28 (literally, we ate the every.single.item on the menu).   :)"}
{"text":"Le Red Tiger is a bit off the high street but that just makes it even cooler, doesn't it? It looks quite hip from the outside. Go inside and you'll become a hipster too. Fortunately it doesn't stop there. The service and and the food are just as nice as the restaurant's interior design. I'm not giving it 5 stars mainly because the choice of vegetarian dishes is very limited. We got the Pate de Riz et Taro aux Oeufs and the Tofu on Tomato Sauce, both $8, accompanied by a bowl of white rice for $3. As a starter we shared the Rouleaux de Printemps which we thought would be deep fried spring rolls but they were actually what I know as summer rolls that are wrapped in rice paper. I'm embarrassed =( I thought I knew my rolls. Anyhow - everything was delicious! The ingredients were crispy fresh and the flavors were perfectly put together. I'd come again =)"}
{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese cuisine. I can definitely attest to that!"}
{"text":"Les saveurs de ma mère et les Souvenirs de mes weeks ends en famille ! Super tapas , et Place cool :) Equipe professionnelle et sympathique ."}
{"text":"Ok. So I rarely give 5 stars. When I do it's because I feel all the elements I'm looking for in a great restaurant experience are reunited: food quality, discovery, service, grounded-none flashy-snobby place, ambiance and of course prices. I found all of that at Ted Tiger. We sat at the bar. Our waiter was really nice and friendly. He recommended dishes to share and made us taste the wine before you pick the one we wanted. The menu is short but very interesting. The food is fresh and well presented, without \"flafla\". The quantities of food is perfect for tapas. The wine list is really short but for my taste they still had at least 2 good choices. The ambiance is just casual, cool. Really good vibe. I'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"It's like a more 'filing' izakaya place buried in 'never-too-much' thai basil & lemon grass! :) And finally a Vietnamese cuisine in Montreal that's not screaming phooooooo! Innovative papaya salad presentation does not shine away from its authentic taste- same thing for the satay skewers and ribs. The crepes are something i've never seen before and i really like it ($12 only and you're already half-full)! The cocktail is a bit more pricy but really good, too. The only downside is how cold it is near the entrance, but i feel the owner has already tried its best by installing heavy-duty curtains and extra heating fans. The service was also surprisingly fast & attentive for a hipster-vibe montreal hangout (for a tuesday night though, see other reviews for the weekends)."}
{"text":"Tonight was ma second round at Le Red Tiger. I made reservation for sister, husband and myself and asked for a specific place and got it. We ordered drinks after drinks, beers after beers and were happy with all the booze that came to us! We then ordered pretty much everything on their menu and enjoyed everything! As vietnamese people, we LOVED everything we chose and we were delighted on how much authentic the food was. I mean, who would actually offer balut on their menu? That takes guts to do so! Props to them!!! My mom will be visiting next week and we'll be coming back for sure! I am so thrilled that real authentic vietnamese food is being offered. Although a bit on the pricey side, i would still definitely recommend this place. Fun, hip, delicious and great service, it was about time something other than a pho restaurant opened up!!!"}
{"text":"we had a few items the green papaya salad was the first thing we had and it was amazing  then it went promptly downhill we got the snails and most of them were must empty shells what little there was it was almost impossible to get out of the shell which was just as well because the two pieces i was able to get tasted putrid and i dont think it was me my favorite food is natto and i love kimchi so i do eat some pretty pungent stuff but this was just wrong before getting the two snails i did ask our server about if there was a trick to getting them out you only get toothpicks as a tool and they do tend to break he said that the problem was that most of them were empty i am not sure why you would put something on the menu that can barely be eaten  the people in the table next to use was also struggling with the snails and like us just gave up trying to eat them  we had a couple of more things that were also disappointing but ended on a high note with the fried wontons  we had heard a lot about their cocktails which was the main reason why we went but while they were fine they failed to deliver what they had been hyped to be  if you go do order the papaya salad and wontons and stir away from the snails"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just a diva when it comes to my Vietnamese food but this kinda fell flat for me. The first time we tried to visit Red Tigre they weren't able to seat us before an hour. The long wait makes sense- these guys can't flip tables FOR BEANS: the visit where we got bar seats it took the better part of an hour to settle up.  The food was pretty meh. As Anny said, the portions are pretty small and rather pricey for nothing exceptionally tasty. The spring and imperial rolls, despite the plating, really tasted like they do anywhere else.   Where things were ok, at least for me, was the music (mom-jean jams all night!), the space (minimally creative but cute enough), and the beer- they have a delicious partnership with Harricana where they have a Red Tigre-specific beer.  I'm sticking to my mom and pop Vietnamese places but I guess if you're dead-set on a hip pub atmosphere, this place is worth a crack."}
{"text":"Charming and vibrant Vietnamese restaurant. Not your typical hole in the wall in China town... It's tapas style so you get to taste a bunch of yummy Vietnamese creations.  I had the papaya salad served in bag just like in Thailand  which was really yummy. Their grilled beef was AMAZING! If you eat beef you MUST order it.Their spring rolls too are really good.   I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Le menu est simple se renouvelle régulièrement et composé d'ingrédients frais et savoureux. Les plats sont divins et les prix ridicules. Le bar est la meilleure option pour le lunch selon moi. La nourriture est authentique, le staff charmant, souriant, attentionné, décontracté, etc. J'aime j'aime j'aime! L'ambiance est tellement le fun, le look et la musique rétro, on ne veut plus quitter! J'ajoute cependant un bémol à mon expérience. La serveuse me parle du nouveau menu de groupe et ça tombe bien j'ai à planifier l'anniversaire de l'être cher. Je tente de prendre une réservation et voilà le charme est brisé. Personne n'est certain si c'est possible de réserver, le chef et copropriétaire prend mes coordonnées et s'engage à me rappeler, ce qu'il ne fait pas. C'est ordinaire quand on possède une entreprise de ne pas respecter ses engagements."}
