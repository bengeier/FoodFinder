{"text":"Amazing steamed buns. The best I've ever had! Friendly service. Beautiful establishment. They pay attention to the smallest details. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Super petite boutique, vivement l'ouverture prochaine d'un restaurant un peu plus grand à l'angle de Laval pour agrandir la cuisine et laisser le chef nous faire déguster encore plus de douceurs"}
{"text":"A great place for lunch close to where I live. The menu is simple and edficient, the place has a nice design and the staff is super friendly. The food, pork and tofu buns, is simply amazing."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this cozy little spot! the buns so delicious - absolutely flawless. The service is so warm and friendly! I can't say enough good things about this spot! Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I couldn't decide between the pork or the vegetarian buns but they were able to give me a pork and a mixed bun. These are probably one of the tastiest buns I've had in a while. The green tea lemonade was perfect with my meal."}
{"text":"Hao is a gem in Montreal. I came from Toronto to try some buns from Hao. I knew about the chef on Instagram for awhile (go follow them @epiceriehao), and have been hyping to try his bao. In short, he delivered. Actually, the experience exceeded my expectations. From the interior design, to the superb service, and of course the awesome food - I will be back every time I'm in the city. 

Going into detail, the interior is a super minimal, and small space. Overall, the attention to detail is impeccable, with everything serving a specific purpose - the sink, bar table, etc. The aura of the restaurant gives a sense of excellence. I appreciated being in such a tasteful, aesthetically pleasing space. The service was very friendly. The cashier was attentive to all the guests that came in and, was very engaging in conversation. She took care of my friends - providing complimentary green tea, as well as accommodating for any extra utensils. In all, she is the perfect person to be welcoming patrons into the restaurant and serving them beyond expectations. 

I tried the vegetarian buns, green salad, and matcha roll cake. Starting off with the buns, normally I don't go for the veg option but these surpassed all my beliefs. A true symphony of flavours and textures. The ridiculously soft, airy, perfect amount of chew bun. Along with delicious combination of tofu, mushroom and peppers sauced with Japanese Kewpie mayo, and topped with crispy onions and coriander. All together they create an ideal combo, both in flavour, aroma, and texture. Next was the green salad, a yummy mix of greens with a satisfying balance of crunch, sweetness, tart, and savoury. Last but not least is the, matcha green cake. A delicate, but sublime array of flavours. With the perfect amount of matcha essence within the cake portion of the desert, and a light creamy filling. So good, that we ordered seconds. 

I highly recommend, stopping by HAO if you're ever in Montreal. They provide a delicious meal, and first rate service. Along with a beautiful space to eat in. Thank you, HAO!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  We came upon it by accident, and stopped in.  Glad we did.  Food was superb.  Service was excellent.  Will definitely return next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Nice clean simple design. Cashier was super friendly. Minimal menu which includes 4 items. I tried the pork buns, they were pretty delicious but found them too expensive for what they are. 10.50$ for 2 tiny buns is a little too much. I ate 2 and was still hungry afterwards..."}
{"text":"This was one of the highlights of my trip to Montreal. I came all the way from NYC to have Hao. I followed the chef on social media for quite some time, and was really looking forward to having his bao. It didn't let me down. In fact, it exceeded my expectations. From the interior, to the loveliest service, to downright delicious food - I will come back for sure. 

The interior is a minimally designed small space, after its namesake Hao (meaning white). The clean modern space doesn't mess around with non-essential decorations. The attention to detail is immaculate. Loved being the space. It makes you feel like you've stumbled upon a gem in the city. 

The service was very friendly. The cashier was very kind to all the guests and was very engaging in conversation. She took care of my friends and was endearing. An excellent person to greet everyone as they come in. She indulged my obsession with the food as well. 

I ordered the Buns Vapeur ( Steamed Buns ). They use organic pork shoulder from a local place called Boucherie Champfleuri. The pork is perfectly braised in soy sauce and is topped with the perfect balance of texture with fried onions and shallots. The bao (bread) was steamed to perfection. It has the right amount of air, and the perfect amount of chew...sticks to your teeth just right. They have a vegetarian option as well. I also had their salad which was fresh, crunchy, and has a light touch of heat...a nice balance to the crisp freshness of the dish. 

For me, it is a perfect place to stop by for a quick bite, or grab a few for friends at a dinner party in Montreal to really impress. 

Make sure to go and follow them on social media for inspiring images."}
{"text":"(Super biased because brother of the owners at Hào).
My brother has been working on his bun recipe for 2 years now before opening their first take-out counter. The pulled pork filling is inspired by the Filipino Siopao Pork Asado (pork marinated in soya sauce). The buns are hand crafted, made with a bun flour and shaped nicely.

I'll eat an order of buns a week and won't ever get tired.

Looking forward to the team at Hào expanding their menu with new fillings. I hear there's a fried chicken one coming soon; and then a Filipino beef caldereta. Miam."}
{"text":"Some of the most delicious buns I have ever had in my life. Beautiful and minimal space with super friendly staff as well. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious buns! Highly recommended! Will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Très bel endroit. Une bonne option pour emporter compte tenu des 4 places assises seulement. C'était savoureux, mais un peu cher pour la taille des buns. J'ai aussi été déçue par le fait qu'on doit commander en paire, sans avoir l'option d'essayer un de chaque. Comme on était 3, on a pu essayer les 2, tres différents chacun, je pense avoir préféré un tout petit peu plus le vege."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent, excellent food.
Not only is the food excellent, but so is the customer service.

The cucumber salad taste great.
The buns look amazing and taste even better.

My boyfriend and I had the pork and the vegeterian (tofu) buns. I thought both were very flavourful and the buns bread were just fluffy enough. 

What I also enjoyed was that the buns were well stuffed, but when you'd bit into them, the filling wouldn't fall everywhere on your hands. I thought the best one was the pork one.

The decor is very minimalistic, but still very stylish. 

I highly recommend that restaurant and will sure be back for some more excellent buns!
\"Bun \" appétit!"}
{"text":"HÀO, je suis fan.
Décor très minimaliste, bouffe simple mais surprenante et service impeccable.
Ma préférence pour le bun au porc effiloché... mon dieu... je suis déjà nostalgique.
S'il n'y a pas de place pour vous asseoir, prenez à emporter et aller le manger au Bar A (à quelques secondes de là) avec une petite bière."}
{"text":"HUGE NUMBER OF LOVE EMOJIS FOR THIS PLACE. Amazing food brilliant concept. Hào is an embodiment of the saying \"less is more\". Simplicity at its best. You have only two options in the menu: Pork Buns or Steamed Buns but my oh my they taste SO good. Small quantity but very filling. So many intricate flavours: the soft steamed buns neutralizing salty pulled pork/veggie filling with crispy onion flakes on top garnished with fresh onion leaves. Wow wow wow I can't recommend this place enough. It's run by a sister brother duo and the brother is the Chef. It's a traditional Filipino recipe. Not much space to sit because people usually just take out but there's a small bar stool area. The owners are super friendly too, they'd love to chat and tell you more about the buns and all. They take debit/credit. And very clean place! Buns are $9.50+ tax"}
{"text":"Service souriant, bon menu. Avec un ami, on est à la recherche des buns à Montréal et j'avais très hâte d'essayer cette place. Il y a trois items sur le menu : buns au porc, buns végé et salade de concombres. 

L'endroit est intime et épuré. Très beau. Le service est très accueillant et sympathique. On voit le jeune chef travailler à l'arrière et on aime le concept. 

Les buns sont servis comme des mini-burgers. Celui au porc goûte un peu trop comme le porc effiloché, alors j'ai été un peu déçu, mais on apprécie que ce soit du porc bio. Étant asiatique, le goût ne me paraissait pas spécial. J'ai hâte de voir comment le menu va évoluer et je reviendrai essayer les buns végé. 

Ils ne prennent pas encore de carte de débit ou de crédit. 10,50$ pour les buns taxes incluses, on laisse un pourboire au sourire irrésistible de Rachelle."}
{"text":"L'épicerie Hao est un vrai bijou à Montréal. Parmi les bonnes adresses qu'offre déjà la ville, j'ajoute et recommande sans hésiter cette boutique pleine de charme. Je m'y suis rendu avec cinq amis de New York, tous justes arrivés à Montréal. Pour nous, cette visite a marqué le début d'un excellent week end. 

Il s'agit d'un petit \" resto \" avec un décor impeccable et un service superbe. Ce n'est pas nécessairement un choix idéal pour l'accueil d'un grand groupe car il n'y a pas de tables. On y mange attablés à des comptoirs longeant les murs. Heureusement, nous avons eu de la chance car personne n'était là sauf nous, donc nous étions seuls pour profiter des lieux. Tenue par deux frères et une sur, cette petite épicerie offre une ambiance intimiste et moderne. Nous avons vraiment apprécié de discuter avec Rachelle qui est une hôtesse très agréable.

Le menu peut paraître un peu limité, mais cela me convenait bien car je préfère les restos spécialisés pour certaines choses/plats. Quelques personnes sur Yelp prétendent que 10$ est un peu cher pour deux buns vapeur, mais après en avoir mangé deux, nous étions rassasiés. J'ai essayé des buns au porc et des buns végétarien. Ces derniers, en particulier étaient incroyablement délicieux et avaient plusieurs saveurs différentes. Normalement je préfère la viande, mais à ma prochaine visite, je commanderai des buns végétarien sans hésiter. De plus, la présentation était parfaitement exécutée telle une oeuvre d'art, comme beaucoup de plats sur ce site.. Dans l'ensemble, nous avons vraiment eu une excellente expérience à l'épicerie Hao et j'aimerais beaucoup y revenir !"}
{"text":"The aesthetic is very minimalistic, making for a very instagram-able place. The people running the place are very nice and provide great service. And best of all the buns are delicious! I prefer the pork one, but the tofu was really good too. Check it out before it gets too much hype!

Also, add the hot sauce, gives it a nice kick."}
{"text":"I was so excited to visit this place since I haven't had siopao (Filipino steamed buns) for a long long time. The place is pretty nice, I like the way they decorated the space, it's very simple and neat. 

They only have 4 items on the menu. I ordered the pork buns which cost $10.50 tax included. The meat was super saucy, succulent and very flavourful and the bun was perfectly cooked. 

I didn't know they only accept cash until I arrived since it is not written anywhere on their website. It was inconvenient and I had to go to the nearest bank to get some cash. The service was quick though, it took maybe less than  5 minutes for my order. It was also super hot in there , they only have a little electric fan on the side. They also have fresh cold water on the counter for the customers. 

Overall , I think the food is great, I do not think it's worth $10.50 though."}
{"text":"A tiny little Filipino restaurant in the heart of Plateau-Mont-Royal. Very minimalist decor. A small Buddha, a cat statue and a plant to be found. A small table by the wall with four stools are standing for people who wants to eat in. That whole square spot is completely white and spotless. At the counter, a small and simplest menu you would encounter, so to make a choice  of your dish won't be as hard. The service is absolutely top notch. I was served by Rachel, and her brother in the back was the cook. I ordered my food; meanwhile my food was in the making, Rachel kept me entertained. We spoke of food and travel. Finally, my lovely looking dishes arrive. My cucumber salad was perfect, the coriander lifted the taste in a high level. Then, vegetarian buns were absolutely a delight fried crispy onions on it...,but slightly dry. I kept drinking lots of water in between. This little quaint spot is adorable and delicious. Absolutely recommended! 

A note: beside the restaurant, the family has a mini grocery... worth it to check out."}
{"text":"So delicious and aesthetically pleasing. We happened upon this delightful little restaurant as we were exploring the neighborhood yesterday and had to come back again today.  A great find for healthy and delicious food!!!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh soooo yummy. The pork one is the best!! The buns are so fluffy and perfect. You'd also expect some of the contents inside to be falling out when you take a bite but some how they didn't and jt stayed inside the bun!

The veggie one was not as impressive but I did want to try it. I probably wouldn't order it again but it was alright to try once."}
{"text":"This was my first bao experience and it was very enjoyable! The best part was the wonderful friendly service. The owner had the biggest smile and seems to love her job. I also appreciated her sticking with me as I work on my french at restaurants.

I went with the pork buns which were served with a very generous portion of meat and topped with shallots, crunchy onions, and sesame seeds. The meat was very flavourful although I didn't find the toppings added much. I would have liked some cilantro (perhaps because I am obsessed with cilantro!) I found the bun itself to be very fresh and delicious.

I also ordered the marinated cucumber salad which I found FANTASTIC (maybe because it had cilantro?) I highly recommend trying this! And the owner was very smart to make sure I was not allergic to peanuts while I was ordering.

Two buns plus the salad was plenty of food but, as others said, the food is not cheap. But this is a great new local place that I definitely want to support, so I will be back!"}
{"text":"Pros
- Delicious bread
- Delicious filling
- Impeccable service (waitress was super kind and helpful)
- Cute little spot
- Small menu (focus on one good thing!!)

Cons
- The price :/
- Small menu (want some more!!!)"}
{"text":"I loved the minimalist deco inside with only white and wood color scheme. The lady working there was super nice and friendly. I loved the fact that they even have a sink for customers to wash their hands, coz eating the buns can be really messy (their aesop hand soap smells really good).

I ordered the pork buns and it turned out to be much smaller than expected. The flavor is nice, but I think the vegetarian one tastes better (I had a bite of my friend's vege buns). I like the plating, I didn't expect buns to be serve in such fancy way. Even though it tastes good, it is not really worth 10,5$. 

It was fun to try it out, but I probably won't be coming back. Maybe if they lower their price."}
{"text":"First time here and the buns were awesome! Girl at the counter was nice and friendly. Wish you had a branch in NJ."}
{"text":"The good: Incredible service. Incredible food (got the pork buns, $10.52 for 2). Beautiful/cozy place. I will ABSOLUTELY be returning. 

The bad: seems like this place will find any reason imaginable to be closed. Best to call and check if they're open before you go."}
{"text":"Probablement les meilleurs buns asiatiques à Montréal! Le petit restaurant est très jolis. Félicitation au chef!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place.  Had the pork bun and cucumber salad.  The service was wonderful, atmosphere very inviting and really lived the esthetic of the whole place.  Definitely would recommend for anyone who loves baos."}
{"text":"Tasty af! I like that you don't have a choice of food; either pork bun or tofu bun! Got both which costed a total of less than $10. Both are delicious, but i have a preference for the pork one. The lady is sooooo nice and was smiling the whole time!! Downside!? Cash only. I am excited to see their renovated bigger place! (((Not too sure if this is actual filipino food tho, kinda just look taiwanese to me)))"}
{"text":"Simple yet delicious. I order the meat bao. The shredded roast pork was very succulent. Mixed with crispy garlic and fresh scallions, it was a perfect combination of flavor and texture. The bao is like a Chinese mantou sliced in half like a burger bun. If I could change anything, maybe I would make it slightly thinner or use the baos that comes with Peking duck. This would increase the ratio of the filling to bun. Overall, great bao. Unique, simple, and artsy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"What a little neighborhood gem. We picked up four pork buns and the dumplings and, since there was no seating available inside (plus we had our dog with us), we took it all to a small park a block away and it was absolutely perfect. Unbelievable quality and flavor and everyone there was remarkably friendly. It's for the best that I don't live here because I would go eat here everyday if I did. We were tired, sweaty, and starving after a big Mount Royal hike on a hot, windless day and we couldn't have stumbled on a better place to revive our spirits."}
{"text":"Fantastic little spot. Very unassuming from the outside but a true gem. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Super-delicious buns! My husband picked up some of the vegetarian ones and brought them home for a snack. Perfect white steamed buns with some kind of faux pulled pork, crispy onions, cilantro and mayo, seasoned with a magical combination of spices that make every bite surprisingly divine. It's $9.50 for two little buns- they won't fill you up- but I honestly think they're worth it. Next time I'll just get four."}
{"text":"MUST HAVE. Everything about this place is perfect - the portion sizes, the atmosphere and, of course, the food. Definitely a go to if you want to grab a quick and delicious lunch in the plateau!"}
{"text":"Ce comptoir asiatique est un petit trésor de la rue Rachel. Tout d'abord, on se fait toujours accueillir et servir avec un sourire grâce à la très gentille Rachelle. Son frère est celui qui fait les buns frais dans la cuisine - une recette qui a été perfectionnée pendant presque 2 ans selon ce que Rachelle me racontait! Pour ce qui en est de l'esthétique minimaliste super Instagrammable, on peut remercier son autre frère qui s'occupe du design du resto.

Les buns au porc braisé inspirés par les siopaos  philippins sont excellents. Genre... vraiment, vraiment bons! Si vous voulez vivre cette explosion de saveurs, arrêtez de me lire et allez à HÀO pour prendre une petite bouchée."}
{"text":"Cute storefront with a clean, minimalistic white appearance. Rachel and her 2 brothers opened Hào about a year ago and wanted to start small. They're definitely onto something!  Rachel is super nice and friendly; she also asks every guest how they heard of Hào.  

I ordered the pork buns and it was served up in less than 5 min hot and steamy.  It's a new take on the traditional bao that Asians know and love. The bun is deconstructed to showcase the filling and topped with deep fried onions, scallions and roasted sesame seeds. Flavor tastes a little like char siu and goes well with Siracha sauce! The buns are soft and can squished to eat with the stuffing. 

I love how they have a sink to wash your hands cause this food is eaten with your hands :)

Final note: they now accept credit cards!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing steam buns... There is nothing like it in the city... Very flavorful. It's a must visit!"}
{"text":"Beautiful food, really warm and friendly service. Great for a quick bite. Can't wait for the expansion!"}
{"text":"Decided to grab a snack here as I was walking by this place and I'm so glad I did. What an exciting time for my taste buds! The sandwich is simple but the flavours are complex. The service was top notch too, the server came and brought it to us outside where we were catching some sun. This little resto is 100% worth going to!"}
{"text":"I have to start by clearing up some confusion. Hao is listed as serving \"Filipino\" food on Yelp, but that's not entirely true--don't expect and traditional lumpia or halo-halo here.  It's probably more accurate to describe Hao as a Pan-Asian fusion restaurant, taking inspiration from a smattering of East Asian culinary traditions, but never really settling comfortably into the tropes of any one cuisine.

Hao has taken the popular \"do less better\" culinary trend to the extreme--they have about three entrees on their menu, and two of these are steamed buns--their specialty. Even their restaurant interior reflects this philosophy--everything is clean, effective, and functional, but the space is very limited.  Be warned: there are about five or so seats in the whole restaurant!

As an American, I am constantly reminded of my shameful monolingualism while visiting Quebec--our orders were taken by a cheerful and outgoing woman who must have been fluent in at least four languages, English and French included. After we got our food, she chatted with us about the restaurant, where we were visiting from, places she'd recommend eating, etc.

For a relatively decent price, we got two buns (we split a single order) that sandwiched  tender, juicy Filipino-style pulled pork in between two soft and fluffy Chinese steamed buns.  The buns were pretty much as good as you can get--the only way I could think of improving the experience might be to add in some American South/Caribbean influences by frying a little bit of the shredded pork at the end. Just something to give it a bit of a \"crunch\" like some barbecues do when they add crackling to some sandwiches--the soft buns and tender pork didn't have much of a textural contrast as I personally would have liked."}
{"text":"Beautiful food. Beautiful sense of aesthetic. Nicest people. The vegetarian option is truly unique and delicious. Yum!"}
{"text":"Impeccable service, polite, bilingual and so very courteous. The design of the counter, because really isn't a restaurant was amazing, check out my pictures to see how clean and well designed the space is. Now onto the food, I really enjoyed the well made buns. I enjoyed my vege buns more than the porch, but both were really good. The menu was small, 4 choices and I took 3 of the 4. Thankfully there are two more spaces on the wall so more options to come I think. The cost, lost them a star, $10 for two small buns hurts and makes this place only for special occasions versus regularly. Try it out."}
{"text":"Road trip -First Stop in Montreal's HAO!   Excellent Veggie and Pork Bun!  Tasty cucumber salad! 
Great Service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Well done on the steam buns. Charming little place on the plateau. Very few seats but it's worth the trip. The placenow takes card payments and not just cash which is a definite plus. On my first visit I discovered they also serve pork dumplings which are not indicated on the menu. This gives me another reason to go back."}
{"text":"Awesome! Yummy buns but best of all - absolutely amazing service! Super-friendly (not the plastic smile kind of friendly, but the truly nice one) and fast. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Super cute place - although a tiny restaurant, its very charming and well decorated.

Excellent food and service:
The cucumber salad is to die for and the buns are delicious.
Portions are great (not too much but definitely enough).
Prices are fair.
Service is extremely friendly.

Only downside: not all method of payments are accepted."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got the steamed pork buns to go. It was surprisingly filling. They are about the size of a fist. The bun itself was nice and thick. It wasn't soggy at all by the time we got home. The pulled pork was very tasty with soya sauce, sesame oil, onion and garlic. This place is good for takeout but they do have counters that you can eat at. The menu is small and consists only of cucumber salad, steamed pork bun or steamed vegetable bun. We walked around for a awhile and the buns were still in very good condition and it tasted very good despite them being less warm."}
{"text":"The place is simply incredible. It is so cozy and the people there are so nice. Finally the food is just delicious it's a gem in city."}
{"text":"This place is great. A block from my work, Hào has become a staple for the days when I want a quick lunch to go! The storefront is exceptionally beautiful: think all-white, minimal and very welcoming. The owners are extremely friendly and warm. In fact, everyone I send to Hào comments on how sweet all the people who work there are!

Now, let's get down to the buns. As a vegetarian, I'm obviously partial to the vegetable buns. They're fresh, crisp and extremely flavourful. My omnivore colleagues tell me that the pork buns are just as delicious. I would also recommend picking up the side salad. It's inexpensive and adds a nice raw crisp to the overall meal.

Overall, I think this place is great. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars rather than 5 is because of the price -- which I think is a bit steep for an order of two buns."}
{"text":"This is a rather belated review, as I paid a visit to Montreal a couple of months back in the summer, but I figured better late than never for a place that has left a great impression.

A couple of friends and I visited on a weekend trip and made a note to visit HAO as a) it had great reviews, b) the pictures looked beautiful, and c) (perhaps most importantly for us) it was conveniently close to our AirBnB. Your reason for visiting should be d) none of the above, because in a foodie city where mainstays such as Au Pied de Cochon, Joe Beef, and Schwartz dominate the headlines all the time, we should all be paying a little more attention to the smaller establishments that offer a much friendlier and more accessible food experience. 

First, the food: as many reviews mentioned, HAO embraces the \"less is more\" philosophy and offers a pared down menu of the essentials - baos consisting of a pork or a vegetarian (tofu) filling, topped with garlic crisps, in between white, fluffy buns; dumplings; cucumber salads. We tried both the pork and tofu buns and the cucumber salad. The pork buns were good, but to my surprise, the tofu ones were my favorite. I am always impressed by vegetarian options that really mimic both the taste and texture of meat it is substituting, this is was outstanding; the tofu absorbed the flavors even better than the pork. My only nit-picky comment is that the buns fall apart easily, so it's difficult to eat with your hands or get the perfect bun to filling ratio. The cucumber salad is nothing to write home about, but you gotta balance your meal with vegetables. 

Next, the service: I went in a group of 6 and Rachelle was more than receptive and helpful. She explained every dish available on the menu (everything was in French) and despite the limited space, she pulled up chairs and set us up, happily made sure we got water and kept a keen eye on our glasses in case we needed a refill. Because it wasn't as busy while we were there, she struck up conversation and gave us local recommendations. It was really clear that she works very hard to give every customer the best experience. 

Finally, the story: Rachelle runs HAO with her brothers. The entire interior of the store was designed by one of her brothers and the recipes and cooking is done by the other. She seems to run the storefront and marketing for the store, and told us how everything came to be; at first, they started as a small catering service and then slowly grew from there until they got a storefront. The store is about a year old now, but they're going to expand to have a large seating area as there is a vacancy in the space next door. It was really inspiring and heartwarming to hear how hard Rachelle and her family worked so hard to get HAO off the ground and clearly they're all very invested in it still - we even saw her mom coming in!

All in all, I really enjoyed my visit and urge everyone to visit for the food and to support an awesome local business!"}
{"text":"Where is the sixth star? This place is amaaaaazing. Fresh made buns and pork and salad are really remarkable. Quick and super tasty."}
