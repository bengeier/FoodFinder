{"text":"Cheap price but large value, the potatoes taste amazing! 
Location is great, near street and besides the Jean Talon Market."}
{"text":"Amazing Middle-Eastern food. Fresh vegetarian dishes too. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ordered during a week day, at 7pm. Delivery was quick, food was hot enough. Food was a 4/5, nice quantity."}
{"text":"Eat here! This place looks like nothing special from the outside, and is essentially a cafeteria-style joint with several pre-set options on a lit board above the counter, but the food is awesome! 

We decided to eat here after circling the Jean-Talon market and figuring that Lebanese is always good, even if it's just simple dips or mezza. 

My husband had the combo plate with chicken and beef shawarma, potatoes, rice, salad, hummus and garlic sauce for $10.99. Holy deliciousness!! The garlic sauce alone was so awesome we could have just eaten that with pita and been super happy (and probably gained several pounds...). The portion was large - almost too much for my husband to eat, and that's saying a lot since he is usually the last one standing at big meals and is often referred to as having two stomaches. Meat was also juicy with crispy pieces and well seasoned, and the salad was a fresh mix of lettuce and spinach, with tomato, onion and pickled veggies. Really great balance. And great value.

I had the vegetarian combo plate with 3 cold salads. There were maybe 10 options to choose from, and I picked lentils and rice; fatoush; and a tourlou-like mix of eggplant, peppers and chick peas in a savory tomato sauce. Eaten with pita, the flavors and textures were totally satisfying. Loved it.

Our only regret is that we didn't have enough time during our weekend in Montreal to go back - but we definitely will next time we are in town. Do yourself a favor and go there now, and often! So fresh, healthy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Decent spot for shawarma. I got a combo chicken and beef. The chicken was better. Their garlic spread was unfortunately not very garlicky. The kibbehs were dry. There are better options at Jean-Talon."}
{"text":"ordered from just eat one evening and to my surprise it was actually good! its not the best ive had but it definitely hits the spot. their garlic sauce is delicious so ask for extra of that"}
{"text":"Falafels should be freshly deep-fried at the time of your order. 

Yesterday evening I purchased falafel sandwiches and some sides for my family at Restaurant Basha by the Jean-Talon market for dinner and I was so disappointed when I saw the guy put cold balls of falafel into our pitas. What?!?!? The whole point of going to a restaurant to have a falafel as opposed to making them at home is that I am paying a premium to have the restaurant deep-fry the falafel balls for me at the time of my order. If I wanted cold falafel balls, well then I could have made them myself at home.  *sigh*  I held out hope that even though the falafels were cold that perhaps they might still taste good but my concerns were spot on as soon as I bit into my sandwich. Honestly, I did not even finish it; something that has never happened before when eating a falafel sandwich. When my husband heard my complaints about how incredibly disappointed I was with our falafel sandwiches he responed with, \"I have never had hot falafels in a pita before. Do they taste better?\" Taste better?! They are night and day!!!! This is tantamount to eating cold french fries. Since I am not from Canada, I wondered out-loud \"are all falafel sandwiches served with cold falafel balls everywhere in Montreal? Dear god, what a terrible tragedy!\"  Sadly, after reading several reviews regarding restaurants serving falafel sandwiches in Montreal, it appears that is the case. Since my craving for a proper falafel sandwich was not satisfied by Basha, we will need to find a restaurant in Montreal that actually fries the falafel balls. I need for my husband to know the hot, crispy and spicy goodness of a proper falafel pita sandwich."}
{"text":"Basha est une chaine de restaurant fast food Libanais. C'est comme quand j'ai fait une critique sur un Subway, tout le monde sait c'est quoi, tout le monde en a déjà manger.
La seule raison pourquoi je fais une critique de celui-là c'est parce qu'au courant des nombreux Basha ou je suis allé mangé, j'ai eut des bonnes et des moins bonnes surprise!

Donc en gros, celui-ci c'est un bon! Les pitas ont plus de \"stock\" et les patates à l'ail sont bonne ici!"}
{"text":"Great middle eastern food and the quality is spot on.  I had the chicken and Shawerma combo plate.  The beef and chicken are both lean and tender.  Potatoes and rice very well cooked."}
{"text":"Une place décente si vous avez vraiment envie d'un shish taouk ou d'un shawarma. Les patates étaient ultra huileuses mais c'est généralement le cas dans ce type de restuaurant. Il y avait de la salade Fatouche mais pas de tabouleh :( La sauce à l'ail était bien bonne et les quantités pour une assiette étaient généreuses. 

Prix similaires à tous les basha/amir, etc."}
{"text":"Great Hummus!  If you're at the Jean Talon market, make sure you stop by for some great vegetarian food.  The place was clean and prices are reasonable.  I'm from NYC and was in town for a couple of days.  It was the best hummus I had in Montreal.  And free wifi as well, which was greatly needed since I was out of my network. I regret I didn't try the roasted potatoes or rice and lentils...they looked really good."}
