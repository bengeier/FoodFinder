{"text":"Quick and friendly service, if you go there with an hour before your movie starts next door, you will have PLENTY of time to eat a large meal and walk over to the theatre.

Decently priced, I've tried many menu items - the rare steak pho is delicious, satay beef salad rolls (my favourites), shrimp salad rolls, vermicelli noodles, etc etc etc. I could go on for days. It's just delicious and a good, quick meal."}
{"text":"I go there for lunch all the time. Its out of my way but well worth the food, service, and prices. They have so many delicious diches and drinks."}
{"text":"Well I have to admit I was somewhat hopeful walking through the door, lots of people, active, well-lit restaurant is always good.  Atmosphere of the place is far superior to the food, alas.  I ordered the #22, the shrimp and chicken, although yellowed and obviously spiced somehow had ZERO taste.  The spring roll, thankfully, tasted like a spring roll.  The meal arrived and I immediately noticed it was basically 2/3 noodle and nothing else.  Sprinklings of meat on top, nothing at ALL like the pictures in the menu.  I had 5 \"slivers\" of shaved chicken meat, one spring roll and 3 shrimp lol a few bits of lettuce and a LOT OF NOODLES.  The meal arrived quickly, but was bordering on cold, not a good sign.  The service was HORRIFIC, by far the worst I've experienced in a long time.  The waitress didn't speak a word at all, but obviously understood SOME English because she got the order right lol.  My glass sat empty for more than half the meal and I had to ASK for a refill of soda, I won't be surprised if I'm charged for the refill also lol.  To sum it all up, it's a cute place to eat, but if you're interested in something more than a forgettable experience go somewhere else.  I'm sure the foam cartons McDonald's used to use would have had more flavour and substance than my meal did."}
{"text":"The service is good but the food is so so.  If you want good pho, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I'm hungry, they're open 7 days, they're fast and the broth is consistent and steamin' hot. Guarantee you can been in and out in like 30 mins.  But is it something crazy special? Not really.  The beef is quality and the spring rolls are made to order, because they burn my hand every time.  

If you're looking for a quick and consistent eat.  Go here."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, just good Vietnamese food! Prices were good, had the #21 which was a large bowl of Phone for $11.95. Quick service too, went on a Saturday night at 6:00pm where all the tables were full and we still had our food within 15-20 minutes. Would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food at the finest Vietnamese taste in clean and pleasant environment , will be back soon and Thank you !!!"}
{"text":"My go-to place for a quick, healthy bowl of Vietnamese noodles when I'm in the NE.  Very reasonable prices, and the staff are friendly and accommodating.  The restaurant is clean and inviting with a mixture of booths and tables.  Peak periods can be quite busy (a good sign in my mind!)  I've only ever had the noodles and soup, but Quynh is consistently tasty, friendly, and quick.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Just had an awesome bowl of sate beef vermicili which was the lunch special.  It included a salad roll and drink all for $10.  Great value."}
{"text":"The first time I came to Quynh's was back in 2003 abouts; the flavours haven't changed and I'm glad. There are several things any Calgarian will appreciate about this place: 1) the food is delicious and really flavorful, 2) friendly and courteous staff (obvious, that doesn't give you a passport to be rude), 3) lots of variety in the menu to cater to both meat lovers and vegetarians, 4) food comes out fast.
I'll drive across the city to eat here; it's just that good!"}
{"text":"Pho quest stop number three. 

I used to frequent this place for lunch quite a bit when I worked nearby, but I usually got rice or noodle dishes. However, being on my current hunt I ordered the pho sate for dinner. Although the restaurant was quite busy (due to cheap movie Tuesday going on at the theatre nearby), my soup came out relatively quickly.

The broth was complimented nicely by the spiciness (not too salty or overly sweet/loaded with MSG), and there was a good ratio of noodles and meat. 

Although not my favourite pho thus far, I still enjoyed my meal.

Tip regarding lunch here, you need to arrive early to beat the rush - I'd recommend around 11:15ish as it does get super busy here."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and I have always been happy.  They have a great selection on their menu, and the owners and staff are great.  The atmosphere is very nice as well.  I only wish they would play something different on the television."}
{"text":"I've tried as many Vietnamese restaurants as I could in Calgary to find the best one. For the past year, this is the one I consistently go back to. The noodle soups never disappoint and all other dishes are great. The soup is the key because it's gotta have the right meaty kick and Quynh does it well. Four stars instead of 5 because of the rare off-day last time when they brought my pho less than hot, so the veggies didn't cook well and bowl got very lukewarm towards the end."}
{"text":"Great little spot for a Vietnamese fix. We ate here before catching a movie at the Cineplex next door. It took a while to get a table even though it was not full at all. However, it has a very nice decor, kind of a modern oriental feel. 
The food came out quickly and looked great (too bad I forgot to take a pic). I got a vermicelli chicken bowl and it tasted as good as it looked. I would say a bit better than other Vietnamese places I've tried in the city. The Vietnamese coffee was strong, smooth and just what we needed. I was very satisfied after my meal at this restaurant."}
{"text":"4 stars for really good food, if it was based on service it'd be one star. Not very friendly or attentive. Inexpensive though and fairly quick."}
{"text":"I am a regular here but it is my first check in. Good place when you are in the mood for Vietnamese cuisine.
We order 3 versions of rice vermicelli with spring rolls with satay chicken, satay beef or satay pork. Children might find them mildly hot but these dishes are okay for adults.
Monday to Friday they have lunch specials which are fabulous value for money for under $10. Please call for daily special as it varies."}
{"text":"My favourite Vietnamese place, the lunch special is always a really good deal, since it comes with a vermicelli dish, a salad roll, and a drink. It's a lot of food and tough to eat in one sitting. I also really like their bubble tea!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! My boyfriend and I come here at least once a week, and it is absolutely delicious every time (I'm craving it right now!!). We order shrimp salad rolls to start, and we alternate between their noodle soups & vermicelli dishes. The management & staff are always so friendly, and the service is fabulous. Great location if you want to have a dinner & movie date night!"}
{"text":"A great place for vietnamese although I have only had their lunch specials.  These are great deals for a drink, large salad roll and a heaping noodle bowl (under $10).  They switch it up to have different types of bowls on special but it is always fresh and delicious with noodles, veggies, cut up spring rolls and a meat (lemon grass chicken, satay beef etc.).  Very clean, friendly and quick.  Avoid going right at noon though, try to get their by 11:45 at the latest  otherwise might have to wait due to the popularity of this place at lunch."}
{"text":"I dont live in Calgary but my boyfriend takes me here everytime I visit. We went twice in the last week. Great food and generous portions"}
{"text":"The prices were good. The service was sub par. No one really spoke to us beyond asking what we wanted to eat and if we needed more water or were all finished. The food was what you would expect, though I found the meat (chicken and shrimp in the vermicelli bowl) to be off tasting and it had a weird texture like you weren't sure if it was fresh or had been loaded with salt or msg. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food I've found in Calgary... It's  Phobulous!

Great food  + great service = great dining experience.  My personal favourite is the number 37 Satay Seafood noodle soup. It's Spicy, savoury and delicious.  

Price wise they are on par with most Vietnamese places.  All items on the menu range from $8-$14 , so a dinner for 2 is less than $30

My girlfriend and I  eat there all the time, and I've eaten there by myself on many occasions.  The service is quick enough you can be in and out in less than 30 mins (depending on how fast you eat).

 It can get busy at supper time since its next door to the movie Theater and people tend to grab dinner before the movies, so there can be a bit of a wait for a table,  however the turnover is high enough you never wait too long.


Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love pho. There's no ifs, ands or buts about it. When it comes to Quynh, I have a mixed rating for you. Here goes:

5 Stars: The ambiance, the space, the service, the bathrooms, the cleanliness, the bubbletea, the selection, the veggie spring rolls and the BEST fried bananas and ice cream I have EVER had. EVUH.

2 Stars: The Pho. Unfortunately, I have had AMAZING pho, and the number 61 here (rice vermicelli, vegetables and spring rolls) just didn't cut it. The spring rolls were amazing, but the vegetables that they put on top were gross. It's like they shredded and pickled veggies and decided to put it on my vermicelli. Gross.

Overall, I will go back again and again and AGAIN, SOLELY for the veggie spring rolls and the fried bananas and ice cream. I wouldn't go back for the pho, but that's okay because I have a major sweet tooth and the next time I'm on my 'fried foods and ice cream diet', I know where to go ;)"}
{"text":"This is on the lower end of average as nothing particularly wowed me. The lower star Yelp reviews say the pho is not that great and I tend to agree. My bowl of pho wasn't as tasty and satisfying as the pho that other restaurants have to offer. The spring rolls were average and my wife's bun bo hue was good. A bit on the expensive side plus they charge for tea."}
{"text":"I am declaring that I like Quynh.

Admittedly it took me a while to like Quynh. I have eaten in many Vietnamese restaurants in my life time. Quynh was never one that blew my mind, it's good food. It is exactly what I expect when I get Vietnamese. Nothing more nothing less. I know people who drive miles to go to Quynh, I don't get it but hey, you could do worse.

I like #15. And the Cold Coffee with Evaporated Milk."}
{"text":"My go to for pho. The best I've found in the city! It is absolutely delicious, I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, and if you're a regular they remember you! Good luck getting a pop refill though."}
{"text":"Good service, nice atmosphere and tasty food. I had the vermicelli deep fried pork spring roll and satay pork. My first time having Vietnamese and I'll be going back again."}
{"text":"During my month long stay, I found myself eating at Quynh's on four separate occasions. Each time, I was greeted with courteous staff and excellent service. I will be out in Calgary again soon and will definitely be returning.

The pho broth is on par or better than most and the actually noodles are so right that Goldilocks would approve. Other offerings like the spring rolls and grilled meats are definitely tasty as well.

Slightly more expensive than the offerings at home for me in the Vancouver area, I never felt as though the prices were unreasonable.

If you're in the area, stop reading and just give it a go!"}
{"text":"This place is my go to pho spot that helps me recover from the worst colds! Their veggie broth is so delicious. i am also in  with their veggie spring rolls. They are so affordably priced and the service is awesome. Thanks Quynh"}
{"text":"My Favorite place to get Pho, their soups are the standard in which I set the bar to all other Pho Joints"}
{"text":"Amazing vermicelli bowls!  I had the beef, chicken and prawns bowl.  Perfect blend of heat and sweet. Reasonable price too."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend have become obsessed with Pho and this is our place to go. We have been to a couple different Pho places in Calgary and this one takes the cake. 
The inside of the restaurant is interesting with lots of cool, oriental art. And service is always fast, unless you go at their peak times.
The salad rolls are always fresh. The Pho has such a good taste and enough spice. And the rice vermicelli is to die for. Highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, Terrible service....waited 15 minutes for drinks... Never got refilled, then waited a further 15 minutes for our bill after they brought us our \"doggie bags\".... Like I said terrific food though..."}
{"text":"Good ol' fashioned Vietnamese food! I got the chicken and vegetable noodle stir fry, and it was really good. Veggies and chicken tasted fresh, noodles were tasty, and the sauce had some great flavour. 

Also - the decor is hilarious. Not tacky at all. :)"}
{"text":"I come here with my family every once in a while and it is our go to Vietnamese restaurant. Food is always consistently good and we always receive friendly service. I highly recommend this place because the food is really good and fresh and they will never let you down."}
{"text":"Might be my favorite restaurant in Calgary.  I'm not a Vietnamese aficionado but I'm always amazed at the flavors and options here. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food, The servers are polite and they always have a Vietnam tourism video playing on the tv to watch while waiting for food."}
{"text":"Great spot and fabulous Vietnamese food.  Went on a Saturday and had no problem getting a table.  Loved that there were chop sticks instead of cutlery on table.  Also nice touch was that didn't have to ask for hot sauce or for my aunt soy sauce already on table.  The waitress was there right away and the food was fantastic....definitely heading back soon. Great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"I can't say that I've been to a Vietnamese restaurant I didn't like, but for some reason this is my favorite.  The restaurant is big, open and bright, it's clean, the service is fast and the food is good and hot!  Especially the soups.  The Currie Chicken Noodle Soup is awesome and another go-to for me is the Lemon Grass Chicken on Fried Rice."}
{"text":"The menu wasn't all that great. The service was rushed and the tables were packed in so tight I was rubbing elbows with the party beside us.

I ordered the pho soup which was just okay. 

It's in a convenient location being right beside the movie theater and it was very reasonably priced but there is so much better Vietnamese in Calgary."}
{"text":"We saw this place while driving around and it got 4 star on Yelp so we have it a try. nice place, first time I've seen a Viet restaurant in Calgary with a line up to be seated. Most of the patrons are not vietnamese.  Deep friend spring rolls are good, great customer service, bette than most other Vit restaurants. Skip the wonton egg noodle bowl and the sweet and sour Vit noodles. We would try this place again but will try their pho next time."}
{"text":"This was the first Vietnamese restaurant I'd ever eaten at years ago. Back when I didn't get the difference between Vietnamese and Chinese... but I was in high school then so you can forgive me. 

Now being more worldly I know Vietnamese Cuisine and happened to go back there before going to a movie at Sunridge. 

I am pleased that they offer some vegetarian items on their menu.  I got the new vegetable pho soup and it was really good. Generally there is the exact same vegetarian items on every Vietnamese menu I've seen in Calgary, so at least it's there. It would be cool to know if they could make some other Vietnamese dishes vegetarian for wider variety. 

But when in the area this is my choice for Vietnamese. Decor is still the same, but the menu has a few new items over the years.  I'm glad they're still in business. They can probably thank the movie theatre for that!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese place to go.  When I'm in Calgary visiting family I make someone take me here.

The food is great and the portions are big.  The service is quick and friendly.  This place is always busy.  Also, you can't beat the Iced Tea candies they give you with your bill.  Anyone want to send me a bag?"}
{"text":"I'm still loving Quynh.  I've ventured beyond pho to try something new, and have thoroughly enjoyed both the sweet and sour soup and the wor won ton soup.  Still highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Vegetables were really nice and fresh. Steamed not mushy. Ordered the chicken satay stir fry and wish it was spicier. ( Im a pasty white girl and it was too mild for me) so if you dont like spice then maybe this is the place for you. Nice clean restaurant- great fast service. Waters were never empty. Prices ok."}
