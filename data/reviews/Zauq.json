{"text":"It's not that the food is bad (though nothing special) but this is by far the worst customer service I've ever experienced at a restaurant and I usually never even bother to comment on service. The reviews for this place are even worst at another site.  Looking around the internet, I'm not the only one as there seem to be other people who have had similar experiences. Restaurant didn't have half the things on their menu when we went because the chef had gone home (despite it not being that late). They brought 3/5 things which we actually ordered for dinner, they didn't let us know that the other two things were not available until after they had brought the food, didn't provide drinks when we asked for them (or refill water) or even the right amount of eating utensils. Waitresses was rude and unapolagetic for their slow and inattentive services and when we asked another waiter a question, he said to ask the waitress serving our table. We could overhear other people eating in complaining about the service as well.  If you are gonna eat-in especially with more than two people then I wouldn't recommend it. Only use it for take-out and even then, there are similar restaurants with cheaper/better take-out. The food was mixed as some dishes were too oily/spicy and the proportions/prices weren't very good. There are a tonne of South Asian restaurants around where you'll get similar/better food and service which is at least adequate. This restaurant is affiliated with Silver Spoon in Heartland which is a take-out only place with decent food but they don't know how to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible service, the place was empty, but it took them an extra 10 minutes to get the food ready. They put our food in a container that had leftover salad! Also, forgot our salad and only gave us the salad dressing! Avoid this restaurant, there are lots of amazing places to order from on Dixie Road."}
{"text":"The food in their lunch menu was really good. Definitely a good portion that will make you sleepy in the afternoon :) I would go back."}
{"text":"Not very clean.  Food was OK.  Nothing great.  The most basic thing you need to do is have a clean restaurant.  Who wants to eat at  dirty place??"}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant this past weekend. We ordered multiple servings of biryani, nihari, beef seekh kabobs, bihari chicken, and Bihari beef kabobs.  The nihari was probably the best I've had outside of my own Pakistani mom's. They stuck true to the traditional way of making it. My other favourite was the Bihari beef, it was spicy and flavourful. Everything else was pretty average, nothing special. Portions were small for the cost, which is the standard for Indian/Pakistani restaurants in the GTA. Service was slow. Items should have been  brought out at once, not one by one."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant that i came to when i came Canada. That was my first and last time. The food is dam expensive, plates were dirty and the glasses that they provided were all stained not only that but the viniger and other things that they had on the table were all dirty. Looks like they never cleaned the place. Food was spicy and high on salt. Don't waste your money and might as well go to Tim Horton instead."}
{"text":"Its a really nice restaurant - quite nicely done makes for a good ambience.  It was voted in BlogTo.com as one of the best Pakistani restaurants in the GTA which inspired us to make the trek out to the west end.  We orderd a BBQ platter, yellow Daal and Chicken Tikka Masala. The platter was really fantastic - a great assortment of beef and chicken kebabs including bihari kebab and hiryali chicken as well. All the meet were tender and perfectly flavourful and grilled.  The daal was mediocre and not memorable which was the same case with the Chicken Tikka Masala unfortunately. The naans were made in house and were perfectly baked!  The service was okay - we were attended to in a timely fashion however they forgot out chicken lollipop chicken as an appetizer which we were looking forward to and one of the glasses set up on the table actually had lip stains on it - really bizarre and made me question the sanitary conditions of this place. But we had made it this far to the west end and i wasn't about to not try the food because of it.  Overall, it was a decent experience but not one that i would specifically go back for.  ps: its Halal"}
{"text":"We used to love catering from Zauq, but I don't know if the owner's have recently changed, but the customer service and food were horrible.    First I called in and some guy picked up, and told me he was too busy and to call back.   You're busy for your customers?  I understand you may be dealing with customers at the restaurant, but then take MY number and call ME back.    But we'd ordered form Zauq before and loved the food so I called back anyways.    I would always go to the Zauq website and select my items, then call in with my order.  This past weekend, I did the same, and the young lady on the other end was very kind in taking my order.  A few minutes later, some guy calls me back and tells me how the girl was new and doesn't know about catering so they couldn't give me some of the items I ordered.  I reminded him that it wasn't her fault, as it was THEIR website where I got the info.  Wrongly blaming your employees - not good!  Next he calls back again and saying that the girl made a mistake and they only cater for 25 and above.  I told him to check his website - it said 20 people for Gold package, and it wasn't the HER fault.  Hopefully, they've changed the site now.  I was ready to cancel, but my husband said to go ahead with the changes in food and number of people because the food was really good in the past.    Well, this time the food quality had decreased.  The eggplant was not cooked.  The food was also not for 25 people. It was a lot less than what we have received in the past for 20 people.    Needless to say - we will not be catering from Zauq ever again.  Customer service and food quality have gone down."}
{"text":"This is quite a decent Pakistani cuisine restaurant. I have tried both sit in and got catering done for above 30 people multiple times.   The food is quite good and the portion size are decent as well. Their chicken Biryani, chicken korma or veal korma or Achari chicken are quite good. Palak  Paaner is not bad either. I also tried there tandoori chicken which was just right. Over all the food is above average and meat is cooked well, which is good.  The sit in service was good but had to wait a little while as our order was quite big. The serve was good inside the restaurant and place is designed nicely to have separate buckets of people and not over crowding the place.  Parking is not a problem as its in a plaza.  For my Muslim Brother and Sister - They serve halal meat"}
{"text":"Ok. I'm a regular at Zauq. Their breakfast special - halwa poori is AMAZING. And so is their nehari.  Again this is not fine dining - so dont expect ambiance and awesome svc. But food is Really good."}
{"text":"I wish I could give more stars but I have to stop on 3.  Good food but poor service.  You need to remind them about your order at least twice.  Sometimes they bring wrong order on the table and say that's what you ordered.  Everyone looks confused.  They need to train their staff and improve customer service."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service that serves cold food and refuses to replace it. Our Biryani was cold and rice gains were really hard. When we requested for another batch, he got pissed off and said see I can't even dip my finger in it as it is so hot. I told him that you have just contaminated the food. Anyways he took the platter away and came back after good 10 minutes and he could barely even hold it too. I touched the platter it was piping hot as it just came out from the high temperatures of microwave. The rice were microwaved; therefore, rice became even harder and dehydrated. Seekh kababs and naans were burned. Our mango milkshake was not even chilled; it was almost like room temperature. People here singing praises for their BUTTER CHICKEN and Garlic Naan. LET ME TELL YOU both BUTTER CHICKEN and Garlic naan should never be a caliber to evaluate Pakistani food, as they both are not Pakistani delicacies.   Staff is extremely rude. We never went back ever since and we won't be going ever again."}
{"text":"First time eating Pakistani food. The food was excellent. Definitely would come back for the Reshmi Kebob and the Chicken Biryani. Great ambience.   Nicely done!"}
{"text":"spent $100 last night with $15 tip on top of that for the WORST food and customer service.  ordered lollipop chicken, masala fries, haleem, fish curry, chicken curry, garlic naan, butter naan.  Everything but the lollipop chicken were fresh and worth eating.  It was my first time and LAST time.  the owner with trimmed beard all the way to serving staff is full of attitude.  We had number of issues with the order and they won't even look at us.  We had been waiting for water, no water came.  we had issue with the plates and glasses, UNCLEANED and they never apologized.  I hope the management reads this message and learn from other successful restaurants."}
{"text":"I have been here countless times over last few years. The food and ambiance is pretty good. I especially love thier Nihari and BBQ. Thier haka food is also pretty good Aswell. Thier service can be a bit slow at times - but I guess that's because the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"Worst service took 30 mins to get our food out when the restaurant wasn't even busy!!Food tasted below average.Never coming bk!"}
{"text":"Food is great and authentic !! 7.99$ lunch combo is a great deal-You can choose a Starter, curry, and rice/naan.Good service and delicious food."}
{"text":"I see a lot of complaints about service, i can't say the service i experienced here was anything less than good, it wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either.  Let me start by saying that i am extremely critical of desi food in Canada, this is my cuisin and i take it very seriously.  The food I can safely say is authentic! We ordered nihari and chicken biryani.. the nihar was delicious, cooked very well, some pieces of meat werent as tender as nihari meat is supposed to be, but they weren't bad either.  Biryani was good and tasted as biryanis are supposed to taste, it didn't exactly taste like a biryani that you would get in pakistan, but it was much better than all the other biryanis i have had in Canada. There were only two pieces of meat in the biryani though :(  No complains, will probably return with me family members."}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic lunch value. All the flavors have been spot-on that I've tried, including chana massala, butter chicken, and chicken tikka. The naan is fresh and excellent and perfect to dip in the various sauces. The price for lunch is great and the portion is perfect for lazy office workers like me. The atmosphere is totally generic, but it's in a strip mall in Mississauga, so what do you expect? I'm docking a point because I notice a dirty dish every other time I eat here. Once is understandable, bit three times is too dirty for five stars."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat every time I visit this beautiful province. Their food is really delicious & always fresh . I haven't tried their full menu yet but i would love too. Service is fast and staff is friendly and always ready to serve.   Really recommended for desi, Chinese food lovers.*****"}
{"text":"I thought of a lot of funny ways of writing this review.  Smash the microwave comments or the lack of understanding how split checks work...  The list can go on and on.  This was until I saw that I was the first to review the restaurant.  I take Yelp seriously as it has led me to many a great gastronomic experience around the world.  To joke about such a poor initial review, in my opinion is irresponsible and unfair to the restaurateur.  They can change their ways and win me back.  Where to start.  We walk in and wait to be seated.  The waiter, who happens to also be the manager (I just think it's a family run business and it was the other waiter's older brother.  More on that later.) Greets us and 'directs' us to sit at the third booth to the right and quickly walks away.  Well, from the perspective of the customer who doesn't see the world from the kitchen door, this is entirely incorrect.  You can see the incorrect mindset of the restaurant right there.  That already gave me an odd feeling of a student teacher relationship if you know what I mean.  We sit down and he makes his way back to the table with four menus, puts them down firmly on the table, pauses and points at the menus.  Then walks away.  wtf?  Very odd behavior.  Minutes pass (We are here for lunch and are salaried so have to get back to work) and there is no movement over to us to take our order.  He finally makes it over to the table next to us and asks if we are ready.  We say yes.  He turns around, takes the check and some dirty dishes and walks to the kitchen.  More minutes pass and still no sign of order being taken.  We had to flag someone down to finally start the process.  The menu is simple and has complete dishes on the left and a lunch 'build your meal' setup on the right.  Makes sense enough to start.  He finally makes it over and my friend had questions about the menu since it's not the most common way to order lunch.  He is corrected and we move onto the next person in the party.  He orders and a snide remark from the waiter chastises my other co-worker for not navigating the menu correctly.  We are all taken aback by such anti-social behavior.  I now definitely know how to order.  I feel like we are at the soup Nazi in NYC.  Orders are taken and we are just chuckling about it now and I am further justified in my initial impression of him when he ordered us where to sit.  Water finally makes its way to us and we wait, and wait, and wait for the food which is supposed to be lunch.  NOTE:  the place is about 25% full so it's not like they are overwhelmed and I should be understanding of their delay.  Food is here!!!  Mine comes out first and it's steaming.  I got Tandoori chicken masala, Biryani, and a somosa.  My other friend's meal came out. He got chicken Pakora naan and some other chicken; don't remember exactly. We wait for the other two dishes to start eating.  They finally make it out and we commence.  My friend got the chicken lollipops and couldn't wait to dig in.  She was happy with the sauce (which kicked ass!) and started enjoying the chicken.  I dug into the samosa which was ok.  Nothing to write home about but ok.  My friend with the Pakora started on his also.  The fourth friend stopped eating because..  Well he never really started because the Fish sticks because they were cold.  He says this just as my other friend is complaining about her cold rice and chicken main course.  Ok, let me stop for a second and explain what I mean by cold and it's a subjective adjective in the cooking world that can mean any number of things.  When I say cold I mean it in the context of, it was just taken out of the refrigerator cold.  I mean, you put it to your mouth and are shocked by the temperature change since you see others food steaming cold.  COLD!!!  They comment on this and both dishes are sent back.  We start chuckling about how the food will be just microwaved and sent back.  At this time, I try my chicken and Biryani dish.  I am underwhelmed at the flavor and am not happy about the temperature of the rice.  However, it's more tepid than the cold of their dishes.  I also don't like to complain.  (I know I know it doesn't sound like it.  :)  )  The meat was tasteless yet cooked perfectly.  It seemed like it was cooked and then the sauce was put on it.  No marriage between the two.  The rice also had an odd metallic flavor to it.  This is when we are all commenting and my friend says his chicken pakora appetizer was dry and not good.  The dishes come back.  One is \"OK\" and the other is still cold.  Not as cold as before but still cold enough to send back.  The poor waiter, who was super nice(not the older one), comes back and is embarrassed.  Poor guy is learning since he even admits to the fact that it needs more time in the microwave.  We laugh!  Her dish goes back and my friend comments how even his salad is hot now since they just threw the whole dish into the microwave not caring what should and shouldn't go in."}
{"text":"Went there for the 3rd time today.   Food is consistently good. So far, have tried and enjoyed their lolly pop chicken, seekh kababs, boneless chicken tikkas, crispy beef and chicken biryani. Wasn't a fan of their karahi chicken and chilli beef.   Ambience is nice for a Pakistani restaurant. Definitely a place to take family and friends.   However the service has been sub-par unfortunately.  Today was a bad experience: I went with the family. My mom was experiencing low blood sugar and wanted to eat something quick (before the actual food came). I asked the server if the vegetable somosas are ready to which he replied \"it'll take a few minutes, it's a dine in restaurant\". I didn't appreciate the latter half of his comment at all.   We wanted to order seekh kababs. The server suggested that he'll give us a discount if we ordered lolly pop chicken ($8.99 per plate). We didnt ask how much discount we'll get however. We ordered two plates and saw that he had charged us $7.99 per plate. I.e a $1 per plate discount - what a deal!! I found the dollar per plate discount a tad bit insulting to be honest.   At the end, when we were getting ready to go, someone from our party knocked over an empty glass. The server told my wife \"I am sorry but my manager said that there is a $5 charge for that\". We paid the additional $5 for the glass (didn't complain at all) and left. We all were very surprised that they made us pay for the broken glass though. To me this was terrible customer service and very short sighted thinking.   My overall thoughts: decent food, great ambience, customer service needs improvement. However, next time, i'll spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Really great food. The Chicken Tikka is so delicious. Their lunch specials are priced low and delicious. When you order takeout, make sure you give them 10 minutes, otherwise you'll end up waiting. But you should love the food!"}
{"text":"We were the only people in the restaurant and the service was very poor. Had to ask 3 times for silverware. We also had to ask twice for glasses and for water.  We ordered the spring rolls.. they did not come with any sauce. When we asked for chutney or a sweet sauce they brought out yogurt. Chicken 65 was good.. on the spicy side nothing amazing. The chow mein noodles were delicious and the Chinese chicken was good as well.. had a sweet and sour flavor to it. The restaurant itself is nice and clean. It is all booth style and they have plenty of seating. Some cute indo/pak decor. They do have tv's as well. Bathroom has 2 stalls in it, but one of the stalls was out of order. This restaurant is halal so that is a good option for all the zabiha waters! The service is slow so if you are in a rush this may not be the best place to come too!"}
{"text":"Food is great but the service is slow. My party of 12 waited over 40 mins to get our food and the restaurant was not busy.  The resto was likely understaffed in the kitchen.   The $7.99 lunch specials are a great deal (11.30-2pm). You can choose an app, curry, and side of rice. Definitely recommend choosing the Fried rice or Manchurian rice as it has more flavour over the Biryani.   Again, the wait was long on the day I visited. Next time I'd likely call ahead an order for pick up!"}
{"text":"For those that have actually had the pleasure of eating good Pakistani food in Pakistan - this is as close as it gets in GTA.  This may be the only place that knows what naan is (bread cooked in a tandoor oven) - other places seem to sell pizza dough."}
{"text":"Best elaichi chai ever!!! Next time I'm in Mississauga I will be back to Zauq just for their chai"}
{"text":"It's a typical desi fast food type joint. We ordered the seek Kabab, butter chicken, and tandoori chicken tikka masala. Food was okay. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"I had 2 HORRIBLE experiences with Zauq during our engagement weekend. The first night, we had ordered food for 50 people for take-out catering. When we picked up the food at the previously-agreed upon time, they said that we were at the wrong location, and we had to pick it up at the Milton location, even though the order was made at Mississauga. On top of that, they didn't have the food ready until 6 p.m, even though the agreed time was 3:30. They refused to deliver the food after they made the mistake or to compensate in any way. The following day, we had ordered food for 30 people, and they messed up that order too! For $260, they gave us only 1 and a half tray of Briyani, 1 SMALL tray of mixed meat, and 1 small tray of rasmalai, and they claimed that was enough for 30 people. Upon calling them on the phone, they were rude to us and wouldn't let us explain why we were upset, as they kept interrupting us. They denied that we had ordered food for 30 people, saying that we had actually said \"20 people\", even though we called them the day before to confirm. The amount of meat they gave us in the tray would not even feed 15 people. ON TOP OF THAT, I highly doubt that the amount of food they gave us was worth $260. We called again the following day to ask for a refund, and of course we haven't heard from them."}
{"text":"We were there for the hakka Chinese Best indo Chinese I've had in my life.  Great ambiance Chicken lollipops were good Beef Manchurian gravy was excellent Noodles with chicken was good Fried fish was great and usually don't like fish Service was superb"}
{"text":"Good food and have always received good customer service. I go here for their Malai Chicken Gravy with the butter garlic naans. Would recommend everyone to try that as its one of the best ive tasted in my dining adventures in the GTA."}
{"text":"Came here for an office lunch with a party of 12. The restaurant was pretty spacious and empty so we thought we'd get our food asap since we were all starving!  We all got their $7.99 lunch combo which lets you choose from an app, main, and curry. I tried their pakora chicken, briyani rice, and butter chicken.  We were pretty sure this entire establishment was only staffed by 1 person (and maybe the waiter doubles as the chef) because it took over half hour for us to get our food.   Long wait aside, the food tasted pretty good! Although the butter chicken was pretty spicy, everything was pretty flavourful. I'd definitely recommend ordering take out next time."}
{"text":"First time here...pretty good. Good food, good service. Look forward to coming back with family and friends."}
{"text":"I had the following lunch combo  Veggie samosa Tandoori naan Butter chicken  To be honest the price was a bit on the high side, but the establishment is a bit classier looking.  The lunch service speed was a bit slower than I preferred though.  I will try it again."}
