{"text":"Well i was looking forward on visiting this pizza joint for a while. I had seen promotions on facebook about this famous poutine pizza. We ordered it for take out tried it and yes it was delicious. However prices were quite expensive there and the owner no so friendly. Maybe because their phones were down that day but i wanted to chat and see what kind of character he was. Was quite cold as a person and i like going to warm friendly joints I guess. I think it is important to connect with your customers.. May give him another try but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"The subs and the pizza are slightly more expensive than the average chain restaurant but the quality is higher as well."}
{"text":"Des sous-marins préparés traditionnellement! Wow, sûrement plus de calories mais tellement bons. Et les frites, les meilleures de la ville. Tout ça livré chaud"}
{"text":"Très déçu. Service à la clientèle horrible, rude et insultant. La qualité de la nourriture ne vaut vraiment pas de se faire insulter simplement car on commande à manger.
Poutine et sous marins vraiment très en dessous de ceux des restaurants alentours."}
