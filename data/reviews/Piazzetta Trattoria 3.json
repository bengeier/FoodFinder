{"text":"We've been here a couple of times now. It's nice and cosy with red brick walls, candles, and black and white photos for decoration. Service was good, but we went on Sunday evenings so it wasn't very busy.   Appetizers: Both the SALMONE MARINATO $12.00 (smoked salmon), and the CARPACCIO DI MANZO $12.00 (carpaccio) were excellent.  Entrees: The ALTO ADIGE $15.00(meat lover's pizza) was great, the COTTOLETTE DI VITTELO $20.00 (veal parmesan) was great, the RIGATONI AL FORNO $15.00 (baked rigatoni with italian sausage) was good, and the LINGUNNI ALLA PESCATORE $16.00 was just ok.   Desserts: the CHEESE CAKE $6.95 was standard, the CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE $6.95 was good, but the SICILIAN CREPE $6.95 was tasteless.   Drinks: liked the German draught. A few different styles on tap.   In the end we enjoyed the food, especially the appetizers. Would definitely go back if I was in the neighbourhood."}

{"text":"My mother and I were looking for a late dinner and wanted to try a new place, so we decided to give this place a try. The place was pretty tiny, which is nice because it feels cozy and it reminds me of a pub, but with all that dark stained wood they could've added a bit more lighting. From what I remember, the walls are hung with framed pictures of famous people eating spaghetti: it's cute. My mom had the Quattro Staggioni pizza ($15) while I had the Cozze (steamed mussels) with the white wine sauce ($13). Her pizza was good for the most part, I tried a slice with the ham and liked it, but the parts with the black olives were too salty. I wasn't too impressed with the mussels though: the white wine sauce was ok, but the mussels were so tiny and what little I could find just fell apart. Some fresh bread before the meal would've been nice, especially with the white wine sauce.  Overall, the food was okay, but I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"Came here with a Buytopia voucher.  First, the music. This place has the weirdest/lame music ever. Some of the music is softer and older than easy listening stations I hear. Find another free online stream!  Service: ok. They try to cater to you, which is good. We had some customizations and they accommodate well.  Starters: Calamari was ok. The mussels were good, but incredibly salty. We still wanted to polish off the sauce.  Mains: Lamb shank was good; angel hair accompanying it: plain. Pizza had a big oily soggy spot in the middle. It was ok, but good pizza in TO is competitive.  Dessert: Tiramisu. Average.  Taking the experience as a whole, I wouldn't choose to go back. We were laughing and commenting about it afterwards, and that's not how we're used to leaving a good dining experience. Nice people though."}
{"text":"Not a very pleasant experience.  1. The restaurant was so cold that I had to wear my winter coat. When I asked, the server explained that the heat was on full blast, and there was nothing else she could do about it. She didn't seem apologetic at all. 2. Although my friends and I were the only 3 people in the restaurant, it took over half an hour for us to receive our sandwiches and salads. 3. My grilled sandwich was burnt on the bottom."}
