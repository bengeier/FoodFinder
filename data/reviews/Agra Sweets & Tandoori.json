{"text":"We tried the non veg thali - the food was fresh and tasty. The meal came with 2 tandoori rotis which were nice and soft. Portion size was good and we could barely eat the dessert.  We came back to try the Saag and were not disappointed."}
{"text":"The channa is always hot and delicious, and when you eat in, portion sizes are huge. Two people could split a veg thali and be stuffed while dining in! Customer service is always friendly. It is our go-to North Indian restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving it one star is because I can't select zero stars.
The WORST service you'll ever experience...unless you're brown. I went in with a friend and placed an order. It took 45 MINUTES to get an order of samosas. All the while at least two dozen indian people came in, placed orders, received their food and left. After almost 25 minutes I finally asked the girl about our samosas. Her reply was \"oh, you want samosas?\"
I was speechless. I finally said yes and told her what I had previously ordered. It took another 20 minutes before I had my order. Yet indian people kept coming and going. 
When I was finally served, she handed us our order and took the money. No apologie and a frown the entire time. 
If your not indian, avoid this place like the plague!"}
