{"text":"I re-visited the Blushing Bakeshop yesterday, because I was in the area and needed a snicky snack.   I'm sorry, these cupcakes are just bad. This is difficult for me to write, because saying a cupcake is \"bad\" is just a stretch. It's like saying a sunny day is \"bad.\"  But alas, the cupcake was so dry, I am pretty sure it was baked the day before, or worse. The icing was ok. But the cake itself just cannot be dry!"}
{"text":"I called in with a short notice, very specific order. Missy and Candace could not have been more helpful arranging the custom cake and administering delivery. As an out of town customer, their guidance was so helpful. After many conversations, and a venue change, they delivered a beautiful cake that tasted just lovely as well. Kudos for wonderful customer service and a delicious product!"}
{"text":"This place has horrible customer service. I called them twice and left messages, no one ever called me back. I called them again and talked with someone about doing a cake for my sisters shower. I had a design in mind and emailed it to them while on the phone. I was told that they wouldn't be able to get back to me about it until after the weekend. Why does it 3 days to look at an email? I was finally sent an email saying the design was too much because it involved fondant and they couldn't help me. That doesn't even warrant a phone call? What a horrible business."}
{"text":"I truly wanted to like these cupcakes, but I have to agree with other reviews in that the cake was sort of dry, and the icing was greasy, and not buttercream.  I have had better frosting from grocery stores and Costco!"}
{"text":"I love these cupcakes so much that I make a trip there from Rock Hill when there is a special occasion.  I bought cupcakes there at Thanksgiving; all different flavors.  After lunch, we had a blast trying the different ones.  When my adult children have a birthday, they look forward to the cupcakes I bring them from Blushing.  We had a wedding shower on St Patrick's Day and had Car Bomb cupcakes.  Everyone at the shower loved these cupcakes.   I can't not even imagine giving them anything less than 5 stars for the acutal cupcakes.  I have talked to owner.  I don't like container that they provide for a dozen cupcakes.  It is difficult to remove but that is the only thing that I don't like about this place.  I have tried several other places around the area and NO PLACE compares to these marvelous cakes."}
{"text":"Picked up an assorted dozen. The icing is the best part. It is not too sweet, rather light and fluffy. However, I couldn't really taste the cream cheese in the red velvet cupcake frosting, which is usually my favorite. Overall, I haven't found a cupcake I don't like!"}
{"text":"My brother and sister-in-law got married in February; they live in Raleigh, along with my parents.  I live in NY with my family; we were finally able to get together to celebrate last week, during our vacation to Carrowinds.  We wanted to get them a wedding cake to make it a true celebration.  I searched Yelp and The Blushing Bakeshop came up.  I left a message and within 24 hours I received a call back from Brittney.  I explained what I was looking to do and where we were staying and she told me that the bake shop was right down the block from the property.  They get their first star for prompt response and location.  We were on the phone for over 30 minutes as we worked out the size of the cake, decorations, flavor, filling, Brittney and Shelby came up with wonderful suggestions and asked tons of questions to get my cake perfect.  they get their second star for their patience and the time they spent with me over the phone.  The third star is for the shop itself.  It was so adorable and exactly what I was expecting I met Shelby, who was so pleasant and happy to have been able to do it for me.  The fourth star was for how beautiful the cake was...it was exactly what I had pictured it would look like.  Brittney and Shelby did exactly what I asked for and it was perfect! The fifth star is for how delicious the cake was - so fresh, not too sweet - just perfect!!!  You have to go visit this bake shop!"}
{"text":"I am new to the area and saw a Yelp deal so decided to try out The Blushing Bakeshop. The lady in the store was very nice and quite knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the products which is why I didn't mind the almost 10 minute wait for them to figure out how to honor my Yelp deal coupon code.   As far as the bakery items go, I guess I am a bit spoiled when it comes to cupcakes having lived in NY  and LA so I wasn't impressed with these cupcakes. They weren't bad but they weren't great either. Also, I had read online that they have alcohol infused cupcakes which was one of the main reasons why I selected this particular bakeshop over others nearby, but they didn't have any available on this particular day which was disappointing. I also tried the chocolate chip cookies which were good but tasted pretty standard homemade so I'm not sure I would pay to get them again.  All and all it's a cute little family run shop and worth a stop if you want a sweet fix but truly hate baking simple homemade items like cookies and cupcakes yourself."}
{"text":"Addictive is the right word. This charming little boutique cupcake bakeshop is the newest addition to Ballantyne Village. My husband and I have been there every weekend and cannot get enough of them! I was never a huge cupcake fan but this place converted me. The cupcakes are so moist topped with just the right amount of fluffy light buttercream frosting (or creamcheese). I dont know how they stay so moist because you really dont taste a butter overload!  They are not sugary sweet which is great because you get to enjoy the flavor of the cupcake.   Speaking of flavor's this place has creative ones! My favorite so far is the Bella Lucia, a vanilla cupcake with nutella center and stracciatella buttercream. Its cute they have names for their cupcakes and these are the ones I recommend- Kimberly (lemon curd cupcake), Jaci (an apple pie in a cupcake), Ruby (choc with strawberry buttercream), Hannah ....   My husband loves them so much he gets his own and won't share!  It is nice to actually see the owner in there, the staff is very friendly and they even have mini cupcake samples out for customers to taste.  The store has a very chic but cozy look (reminds me of Anthropologie, my favorite store) , they serve water and coffee although cupcakes is all we care about.  I tried SAS cupcakes in the past and this place blows them out the water, there is no comparison. I won't even spend time commenting on SAS..   One last note, because I tend to eat them all at once, the owner said I could freeze them. They last a while in the freezer (you can use the box they give you for freezing) and defrost for 2 hours at room temperature and they taste as good as fresh! I have had her cupcakes after keeping them for 2 days and they are still so moist.  I cannot wait to go back and try their other flavors. This GEM is here to stay!"}
{"text":"Perfect icing/cake ratio! The cake is moist, the buttercream is light. They use fresh ingredients and you can taste the quality. This is not the overly-sweet kid-style cupcake. The flavors are complex yet simple. They even have Thirsty Thursday flavors that are made in adult beverage flavors. These are, by far, the best quality cupcakes that I have ever had. Check them out!   Just a heads up, the vanilla-based cakes tend to be a little more dry and crumbly than the other flavors which are very moist."}
{"text":"Yay for yet another cupcake establishment in the area. There can never be enough of them! I had a Groupon that I bought earlier in the year for 4 cupcakes that's been sitting at home, collecting dust and finally mustered up enough energy to drive down to Ballantyne to collect on them.   I got 4 and I really can't remember the \"technical\" names of them which just throw me off but one was a birthday cupcake, carrot cake, apple cake and boston creme. I tried the carrot cake one which was delectable and everything I hoped it would be along with the birthday one. Their buttercream frosting was out of this world and almost as big as the actual cupcake. I will be coming back (as much as my thighs hate me) for the frosting alone. Cupcakes were a bit pricey (I believe $2.75 a pop) but think this would be a special treat kind of place. The size of them reminded me of Georgetown cupcake in DC, which is a top notch cupcake place I've visited. They have parking right in front and in the garage at Ballantyne Village, definitely stop by this place after dinner or a movie!"}
{"text":"Great locally owned bakery. Very nice, helpful staff and yummy cakes and desserts. I love the special occasion cakes they made and they even deliver if you need them to. I often stop by and treat myself to a cake pop when I go to the nail salon next door."}
{"text":"Cupcakes.  Wars are fought over them.  Cities are defined by them.  Women love them; men want to be them.    I was lucky enough to buy a Groupon for the Blushing Bakeshop and couldn't wait to try it out.    The decor was very cool and the staff were quite friendly and conversational, which I love.  It was obvious they took pride in their work, which also shone through in taste.  I tried a few flavors: key lime, mocha, red velvet, and strateialla (I can't spell or pronounce that, sorry).  The frosting was beautiful, the cakes were moist, and they looked so cute.  Deeeelicious.    Unfortunately the location is absolutely nowhere near my home... but, maybe that's a good thing, because I'd be eating cupcakes constantly otherwise!  Definitely check this place out if you're ever in a 10-mile radius of it!"}
{"text":"I just found out about this place, oddly enough since I love cupcakes. I had the vanilla cupcake with vanilla buttercream last weekend and it was delicious. The cake was super-moist and the frosting was light and not overly sweet, which I like. However, I went back tonight and purchased the lemon-curd cupcake with the raspberry filling and I was so dissapointed. The cake itself was as delicious as the first one I tried, but the buttercream was terrible. It had no flavor at all, and was very greasy. It had almost a Crisco-like greasy flavor and texture to it that left my lips feeling like I just applied chapstick. There was absolutely no raspberry flavor at all. I'm not sure if I just had a bad cupcake, or if they forgot an ingredient in the frosting or what, but it was so dissapointing.   As for the service, I wasn't overly impressed with either visit. Last weekend there were three employees standing near the cash register and I was not greeted at all as I looked over the cupcake option. Tonight the employee just seemed bored and offered no help. I just assume that most employees would be happy to work in a cupcake boutique because, well, they get to work around cupcakes all day! A smile and hello would go a long way."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times, trying to see if after being established they would gain their footing....1 majorly positive thing is the people who work there are SUPER Friendly and NICE and HELPFUL!! Each time....great people. The baked goods however have been between disappointing and \"meh\" . I recently tried a gooey bar with chipotle bacon.This was the experiment of the baker it seems...the bacon used was tough so each bite that had a piece of bacon left me checking my bite to see if I had accidentally picked up a piece of paper. The top of the gooey bar was too sweet ....definitely an experiment. The random cupcakes I've bought have been too dry or flavorless...but there was a red velvet cupcake with an Oreo cookie on the bottom that was good.  Unfortunately with this place, I think they should focus on doing a few things well and master those first. Then branch out to unique items. As it stands now, this isnt a place I think to go to...I just keep trying them to check on their progress and to see if we finally have a good bakery in the steele creek area yet."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday to get an assortment of cupcakes for David's birthday and may be stopping back again soon to get some cupcakes for Lauren's birthday.   This time I got 2 each of the following: BELLA LUCIA - a vanilla cake with Nutella center & topped w/ stracciatella buttercream; DURACELLE - a carrot and walnut cake topped w/cream cheese frosting and a dusting of cinnamon; FIONA - chocolate cake filled with a chocolate raspberry gananche and topped w/ raspberry buttercream; KIMBERLY - vanilla cake filled with a homemade lemon curd and topped w/ lemony cream cheese frosting.  The cakes are moist and tasty  and the icing is perfect.    As for the people who have written negative reviews, I think that they  must have either gotten old cupcakes or had cupcakes that were not stored at proper temps prior to eating them.  Everytime I have gone to the shop at Ballantyne Village to get cupcakes, they have been fresh and delish.    Now, you definititely cannot leave these things in the car while you're doing more shopping or running errands becasue of the heat and humidity around here.  They definitely have to be kept at proper temps or the buttercream frosting is going to melt/separate/get slimy, or spoil in the case of the cream cheese.   Remember folks, these are not the typical \"Commerical grade\" bakery cupcakes -- they are not filled with preservatives or loaded with corn syrup like the ones you get at HT or Lowe's Foods...so a little more care must be taken with them."}
{"text":"I'm blushing over the fact that yes, I participated in eating four cupcakes.  Hmmmmm. Red velvet, vanilla on chocolate, nutella somethin' somethin' and a chocolate orange.  Rodrick from supper club liked the orange the best. Tonya liked the chocolate cupcake the best and nutella frosting. Cuz, I'm complex like that."}
{"text":"I've been perusing the shops and restaurants of Ballantyne Village all these years and have yet to make it into The Blushing Bakeshop until recently. Though I'm not the hugest fan of baked goods to the tune of cupcakes, cakes, cookies,...or really anything cake-y, for that matter, but I like this place. Here's why:  Sometimes, normal biz hours aren't within the constraint of my day's allowance and, thus, I typically don't get a chance to visit many places that close before 6pm. Luckily, these fine people are open until 7pm most weekdays, and we made it in just before then. The employee, can't remember her name, was very welcoming and invited us right on in. The hours on the door may say they close at 6pm, but their Yelp info is right! Huge win here. Otherwise, we would have just turned around.   The interior is quaint and riddled with pink, pink items, pink edibles, and other pinkable pinking pink-type things. Again, I'm not the biggest fan of cupcakes, but we happily obliged for the chocolate birthday cake and baker's choice for the day -- a white cake with chocolate frosting. Both were fine, but nothing to write home about. I think they had been sitting out for a while that day, but if the cake part had been fresh, I'm sure it would have been better. The buttercream on both were very, very well executed. Not stacked too high like some other places, which I greatly appreciate. As a mustache & beard holding gentleman, high frosting is a disaster. We also ordered a very, very, very good santa cookie. Dude, give me a glass of milk or cup of coffee with one of those jokers again and I'm a happy camper. Soft cookie, light frosting, sprinkles, and great vanilla flavor.   The cake decorating here is very clean, too. Where I can't comment on the cakes themselves, I will say that they are gorgeous.   Though I don't think the cupcakes are amazing by any constraint, those cookies, the service, and accessibility and variety, this place deserves 4 stars in my book."}
{"text":"I didn't get to try the cupcakes but this is more about the actual operations. I purchase a coupon from YELP and went on  10/1 @ 3pm during NORMAL business hours and the store was closed! I remembered why I had never stopped by they are ALWAYS closed regardless of what the sign say. Not good if your trying to establish yourself in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I ordered a small round sugar-free cake and 7 dozen cupcakes for a 50th anniversary party. I was very unhappy with the way that the top cake turned out as it was running and falling apart. The cupcakes had very little frosting on them when we went to pick them up and we had to wait another 45 minutes for them to add more frosting to all 7 dozen. The two shop owners, Candice and Missy seemed to have a bit of miscommunication between the two of them as I had to have several conversations with each of them about what my order was supposed to be. It was quite aggravating. Upon returning the cupcake stand that I rented from them I showed Candice pictures of the top cake and how it turned out and how it oozed liquid from the bottom and sides of it. Her response seemed as if she didn't care since she didn't make it because she was out of town. She offered no compensation other than to say if I ever come back they could give me a gift card. No apology or anything!"}
{"text":"Frozen wedding cake, anyone?!?! My husband and I went for a tasting at The Blushing Bakeshop in early 2015 (Jan/Feb) and enjoyed their products so we booked them for our wedding cake. Fast forward to our wedding day in October 2015...I look at our wedding cake and it doesn't look like the inspiration pictures that we shared with her. Then as we are cutting our piece of the cake, it  was difficult to get the knife through the cake and the frosting falls off the cake! As one of the servers at the reception was cutting the cake to serve to the guests, she was having a lot of trouble. As it turns out, the cake was frozen!! What a disappointment!!! I contacted Brandy at The Blushing Bakeshop after we returned from our honeymoon and she replied that our cake was never frozen. She said that it was \"chilled and then packed in dry ice for delivery purposes\" because it was warm and very humid that day. Perhaps she doesn't know that dry ice can freeze food. Then she went on to mention the temperature in the reception area, as if the temperature in the reception room was at fault for FROZEN CAKE!!! She claimed she was never given pictures of what we wanted, all she had was her sketch. I know for a fact that I gave her copies of pictures that I had printed. So unless you are looking for a frozen wedding cake you may want to keep looking for another bakery!"}
{"text":"Brandi was very accommodating in taking the order, making suggestions, and following up on any outstanding issues.  The cupcakes were beautifully decorated for the baby shower."}
{"text":"Found this spot right near my office by accident. I've been back 3xs in 2 weeks. The cupcakes & gooey cookies are excellent. My wife has a gluten allergy & there were even 3 selections for her. I have yet to try a full cake for a special event BUT I'm counting down the day. The store is cute & u see it's creative."}
{"text":"I have not tried their cupcakes yet, but as a huge cupcake fan (I watch Cupcake Wars), I may have to opportunity to do so in the future. My review is for service. I was tasked with getting cupcakes for a friend's birthday party. I looked at reviews and searched for various places online. Being new to the area. I wasn't sure where to start and it can get overwhelming with many options in the area. I queried several places and while some responded quickly, others responded within 24 hrs and some did not respond at all.   This place responded within several days after my initial inquiry; however, I had already found a place by the time they got back to me. (My deadline was fast approaching so I didn't have time to go back and rethink my baker of choice).   I am big on reviews, good or bad. I expect businesses to treat customers like customers. Service is big to me and goes a long way even if it is just a mere acknowledgment of your inquiry!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  It was a cute shop in a cute shopping center, they gave me a cute little container to carry home the cute little cupcakes (emphasis on little).  But I just was not that into it.    I came here to get my 3 y/o nephew a treat for being good at lunch.  He wanted chocolate and I decided to take home 3 more to fill said cute to go container.  I went with red velvet, vanilla and a Boston cream pie cupcake.  Once home, I cut a piece off of the red velvet to try.  The frosting tasted more sour than I expected and the cupcake was dry and almost stale tasting.  Okay I will try the Boston cream pie, so I cut a peice of that and figure it has to be moist since it has the filling inside, wrong.  There was a tiny ammount of filling and again, the cupcake was dry and not fresh at all.  Frosting was some kind of chocolate and it wasn't very good.  I decided to not bother with the vanilla and just left all the remainders at my sisters house since little kids will eat anything.  I did take a small piece of the chocolate cupcake and that was a bit more moist, but still not great for a $2.75 treat.  I will stick with Nona's and Polka Dot for my cupcake treats!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today, and loved how quaint it is! Super friendly staff. Cookies and treats displayed around the store. Got two cupcakes and the coconut macaroon. The Vanilla Happy Birthday cupcake was \"eh\".  The cake part tasted like a corn muffin. The icing tasted a bit like marshmallow.  The Duracelle looked interesting. The cake was soft and had long strands of carrots and spiced bits. There could have been more flavor to it. The coconut macaroon didn't taste like one at all; more of a mound of coconut strands."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place and never found time, went to their old location first not realizing they moved and finally found them in shopping center with Jack in the Box, Cici's and Aldi's. Their baked goods are great! Not a fan of cupcakes but got their macaroons a brownie and a lemon bar and all very yummy."}
{"text":"I stopped in to buy cupcakes for my brother's birthday,  there were no ready made chocolate cupcakes, so I ordered cookies & creme and picked up later that day. The service was awesome & cupcakes were delicious! I love supporting small business like this!"}
{"text":"I went to the small booth at the Northlake Mall to get a cupcake from \"The Blushing Bakeshop.\" I have to say that I was a little disappointed. The cupcakes had both good and bad qualities to them. The cupcake taste good when I tried a taster at the mall but by the time I got home the cupcake taste like it was a day old. dry and hard. but you can tell they had been sitting for some time. However, I went to the actual store and brought one and I must say it was bursting with flavor.. but the cost is ridiculous $3.00 for one cupcake which is not all that big is a disappointment."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful bakeries and sweets. Their decorations and presentation of the cake pops, cupcakes were on point! So pretty! Service was wonderful, came and delivered. However, it was wayyyyy too sweet on my likings. If they could tone down on the overload of sugar, it would be really good. Cake pops weren't super moist, a little dry."}
{"text":"I have to give this place only two stars because no way should a cupcake cost $2.75 under any circumstance.  The reason it's not 1 star is the cupcakes are delicious.  They are undersized.  One reviewer mentioned they are the perfect size... and they are, for a six year old.  For an adult, they are small.  At $2.75 per, you should get an oversized cupcake.  Batter and frosting are not expensive.  Yeah, their rent in Ballantyne Village is probably pricey... but if that's the case... move.  I hate to use this term, but I felt their prices are a rip off for what you get.  Again: delicious cupcakes, horrible value."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I LOVE this place! I recently had the Sangria Cupcakes and Lemon Bars! The Lemon Bars are Huge!!! I cut one half for the both of us.   We are planning to order our wedding desserts from here. The prices are also great! Considering we are on a budget.  The shop is conveniently located off South Tryon, lots of parking. I personally love the displays here, such a great representation of their work. Everyone here is super nice and informative! I haven't used my Yelp check-in offer!! I need to lol I keep forgetting.   I think my favorite cake here is the amaretto! It's soooooo yummy! Also the champagne flavor is off the charts!!!! I'm really looking forward to ordering all my desserts from here!! Also, be sure to try their chocolate chip cookies! It's a shame I didn't order more than three. Thank you again ladies!"}
{"text":"I was craving cupcakes so I headed over the blushing Bakeshop, partially because it's close to my job and partially because if you check in here via yelp you get a free cupcake (when you buy a cupcake). The shop is surrounded by a plethora of other businesses. The shop is small and I was greeted promptly. I purchased a strawberry cupcake, cookies n cream and a double chocolate one. The cupcakes are placed in little plastic containers for safe traveling. I intended on eating a cupcake there but I believe the employees were trying to eat lunch and I didn't really want to impose. I tried the strawberry one first, it wasn't bad but it was pretty dry. I wasn't a huge fan of the icing either. Next was the cookies n cream cupcake. The Oreo on top was stale so I didn't bother with eating it. This cupcake wasn't as dry as the strawberry but still not what I was hoping for. The cupcakes are on the smaller side so I wasn't really impressed with that either. They do offer alcohol infused cupcakes as well as custom made items. I would give this place another try, however I was in no way satisfied by my first visit."}
{"text":"I went here today based on the cupcake flavors they had online, granted not all would be available.  I wanted to mocha chocolate chip but it was sold out! I ended up getting the strawberry cupcake with chocolate frosting. I ended up eating it there and I totally took my time because it was very delicious.  It's the right portion as well so it's not total sugar overload. Decadent and yum.....will be back for other flavors."}
{"text":"I noticed this little bake shop on my way through the parking lot so decided to stop in.  The owner, Brandy, was there and she was so nice!  She showed me all around the super cute shop, told me about their monthly activities, gave me a menu and helped me pick out some goodies to try.  I ended up with a small box of assorted cupcakes that were very well received when I got home!  They even offer \"adult\" cupcakes made with alcohol in them.  I had a mini lemon drop cupcake and though Brandy said it was full of vodka, I really couldn't taste it (which I was happy about) but I could feel the vodka so I know it was in there!    This is a great little bake shop that does wedding cakes, less formal cakes and cupcakes.  It's cute, it's local and it's a must try!  :-)"}
{"text":"Not much of a fan of cupcakes? How about one with a bit of alcohol (flavor, perhaps) thrown in? That may tip you in the right direction. Don't like those little, bitty cupcakes served at some places? How about one that you can barely fit in your mouth? Don't like the big bad corporate culture for whatever reason? Buy from a local shop.  You get the idea. There are all sorts of reasons to like The Blushing Bakeshop, not the least of which is if you happen upon a guy who looks better suited to be a Carolina Panther than to be serving you cupcakes. But that is only the proverbial icing on the cake. What it really comes down to is if the store itself is worth the trip, and the answer there is: Maybe.  Though they seem to provide more than just cupcakes, that appears to be why most people visit - after all, the majority of customers will not have more than one wedding cake, and even those that do have more than one will not get a cake weekly, right? So looking at the cupcakes, they are okay, but you probably aren't going to go far out of your way just for one of them, no matter how good they are. If you are in the area, by all means stop in, but it may not be worth a drive across town."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful, the smell of fresh baked cupcakes when you walk in.  I havent found that many places that really know how to bake a great cupcake. The blushing bakeshop is perfect, red velvet is not easy most people either do to much red dye or to much cocoa.  Their red velvet was moist and had the best flavor.  The buttercream was not like regular icing, its smooth an fluffy I'm afraid I could eat a bucket of it lol  I also tried the lemon and a chocolate one they have several of the same flavors everyday , but several different ones each day.  I just visited last night, I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints when I'm in the mood for a cupcake. They have a great selection of flavors from Red Velvet, to Birthday Cake, to Carrot Cake! My personal fave is the \"Lola\" which it chocolate cake topped with chocolate buttercream. Customer service is fantastic and you get a punch card, which reminds me I am due for a free cupcake!"}
{"text":"Oooh! This place is my cup of cake, hands down. And I've tried a lot of cupcakes. Last week I had to bash a fellow indian's business, but this week I get to promote one.   I know cupcakes are a splurge, but these ones are really worth your $2.75 and here's why: - They are sized just right, not too large or too big, leaving your sweet tooth satisfied and your stomach still stable.  - The frosting is fantastic, you can eat it alone and it isn't sickly sweet, and it's not piled on so high that it topples once you take a bite. No overkill here, just a well balanced amount of buttercream. - The cake is moist yet fluffy and light, not overly dense, certainly not dry.  - The flavors rock and there's a lot of variety! The Savannah (classic red velvet) is splendid, the Duracelle (carrot walnut) is delish, the Betsy comes adorned with bits of dark chocolate, and hi, they have nutella filled cupcakes! Nut kidding! Their dark chocolate cakes pass my high standards, and I really can walk away from this place feeling great.   Now I need to go back for their thirsty thursday specials, yes, it's what you think, liquor laced cupcakes. What a fantastic idea.   Blushing has really perfected the art of making a cupcake and it's a great mood booster to have a well-made cupcake. What's more, the art shines through in their beautiful custom-made decorations too, which is why I'm using them for an engagement party we are having. Little delectable pieces of edible art, I love it.  The staff is friendly, you can tell the owner takes pride in her cakes, and they have a little kiosk in the South Park mall too.  So, skip SAS's sad cupcakes and try Blushing instead. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"We did a cupcake run on a random Thursday night & although were closing gave my daughter & I excellent service. Cupcakes were great blonde dry & crumbled when I pulled apart"}
{"text":"I've visited on 2 occasions. Unimpressed both times. The first time I ordered, I got a red velvet cupcake. Very underwhelming and dry. Nevertheless, I rendered them a second try, this time with a custom order for \"21 and over cupcakes\" (cupcakes infused with alcohol). May I say that the taste was artificial and quite disappointing! Never again will I extend another try unless drastic improvement is made and quality control is assured."}
{"text":"I'm a little torn on the best rating for my recent cake purchase. I ordered a salted caramel brownie cake. I asked for them to decorate nice but didn't have to say happy birthday. First, the cake was literally blank wished I had looked at the store when I picked up. Was super disappointed as the cake was $45 and more effort should have been put into making it look nice. The buttercream was sweet but a little hard. It was suppose to taste like salted caramel and it did not at all it was plain vanilla so I think they forgot or put the wrong one on. The only plus is the cake was dense and super moist. But I paid way too much for a chocolate cake with vanilla buttercream. Super disappointed that the cake tastes nothing like what I ordered."}
{"text":"had the Lola cupcake, which is chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream. Overall I  felt this was an average cupcake. The cake was on the dry side with chips of chocolate in it. Honestly it felt as though I could have made a better cake at home. The buttercream was a \"whipped\" type of frosting; very light and not sweet, but also lacking flavor and with a mouthfeel that is almost greasy from the butter.   The shop itself is pleasant and very feminine; staff was welcoming. The cupcakes look adorable, but the bland dry taste will probably prevent me from visiting this shop again."}
{"text":"Had a large cupcake order and was not pleased with how they looked. Had 3 different flavors that tasted great, but the icing and fondant decorations were poorly done. I called to let them know I wasn't happy, but since the party was hours away there was nothing I could do. They offered to fix them but there was no time. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Wednesday at 1315. Place is closed. Hmmm. Friday at 1102, still closed. Just looking in the door it looks like one of those fru fru custom order shops. One of those places for people who enjoy paying too much for cakes and cupcakes."}

{"text":"Everyone has their own idea of what makes a good cupcake.  This place just doesn't happen to do it for me.    The shop is adorable, feminine, chic, etc.  There are quite a few things that add charm to this bakery.  The names of the cupcakes are cute and they offer vegan cupcakes a couple times a week.  The icing is very bland.  It is more of a whipped texture or like a foam.  You know the foam that sits at the top of your latte?  Well, condense that a little bit more and you will have the icing from this bakeshop.  Truthfully, it was tasteless.  I can be a little extreme because I like the real sugary, buttery icings so this one was just way off for me.    The cake part was okay.  We ordered a chocolate raspberry cupcake and the chocolate cake was decent but a little dry.  There was a raspberry flavored ganache in the center but it was very rich.    This was my second time here and I really wanted to make it work.  It just didn't."}
{"text":"I could not be happier that this place is no longer in Ballantyne! The staff has no idea how to treat its customers! I tried to visit this location for a consult on wedding cupcakes and was treated as though they didn't have time for me even though I set up an appt a month in advance! So happy I went with another company that was more than happy to fulfill my order and give me the service I deserved. Goodbye and good riddance!"}
{"text":"I went in because I saw the Yelp deal and was really craving a cupcake. I must say I'm slightly spoiled because I lived within 10 minutes of 2 cupcake bakeries that won Cupcake Wars. So my cupcake love is real.   The bakery smelled amazing and is super cute. I got three different cupcakes to try and have to sadly say that I was not impressed. The cupcake itself could have been a bit more noisy and the desiring was just too whipped and light. I like a heavier frosting (particularly on a heavy chocolate or red velvet cupcake.   I would go back but only with some kind of coupon and probably not for the cupcakes. Their other baked good looked pretty yummy, but I can't clean to how they east.   On a side note it took probably 10 minutes for the employee to figure out how to take my Yelp deal and at the end she just wrote down the number."}
