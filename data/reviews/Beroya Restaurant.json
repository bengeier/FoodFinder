{"text":"Amazing love the Armenian salad the fatouch so good. Anything you pick is amazing and such a different twist.  Favorite the fresh pita the Mohammara and Hommos... my favorite is the Toshka. Been here 4 times never disappointed"}
{"text":"Went last Friday with my family, food was great,well spiced and tasty. Nice Oud performance. Kids friendly restaurant. They keep serving hot pita bread and i think it is a hit and would soon be known in Laval for this extraordinary addition. The service was perfect and the price was responsible comparing to the service and food and comparing all other middle eastern restaurant i tried before.i will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"Visited with friends on Jan 15.  Restaurent opened recently (last month).  We were fully satisfied.  Service is excellent (nice & professional waiter). Food excellent.  Excellent kibeh nayeh and kras belnaknak.  Tabouleh is quite fresh.  Kafta is testy.  Will surely come back again"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service ...   Ordered tow for 79$ . Side dishes were too many. It main item was on my one.:( Great dessert, overall great experience"}
{"text":"Syrian Restaurant   The waiter just told me that this place has been open for only 3 weeks, I guess that is why there are no reviews.   Where would I start! I came here with my wife and kids, hoping for a nice time. Well, this place has changed the standard of fine dining and restaurants in Laval or even Montreal! A lot of the fancy places around town, especially middle eastern, have a new competition. Fine Syrian Cuisine from Aleppo at its best!  Food: the portions are a bit shrinking (every time I come back here I notice the portions are becoming less -too bad- I had to update my review here . I didn't change my rating but if next time I come here and I see less portions then I would change my star rating for sure), the taste, the presentation, and every aspect of it.... simply amazing! You rarely find a place that offers all these together! I want to go there again just for the sake of trying other dishes.   Ambiance: the decor, the place, the music, the tables, the cleanliness, everything is just well done and fits the place and the food it is offering. It has an easy access parking area, and families with kids can have nice time as well. The tables are big and the place is big and spacious.   Service: The place was almost full, the staff were very helpful and friendly. We got the food very quickly without a delay.  Nice service and great smile!  Price: This is an important part for all! I believe that this place is not extremely expensive but it is better than other places within the same price range! For the portions and the amazing TASTE, it is not that expensive. The average price per person is about $30-$50, which is very reasonable for a \"fancy\" place like this.   I would definitely come back again and for sure will recommend it to all. I only hope that it keeps up the good service and good food.   I look forward to see others review this place too !"}
{"text":"Let's get the obvious out of the way, you will never find better food anywhere else . I went with my extended family there for Mother's Day and ordered many plates and they exceeded my expectations in every way . The service is beyond professional and this is unexpected from an Arabic establishment.  The only possible critic I can say is , it would be nice to have olive plates.  Great place and will be a loyal customer for years to come."}
{"text":"My first experience of Syrian food.  Delicious!  I often eat in Lebanese restaurants and though there were some similar dishes I tried some that I had not tasted before.  There are some tasty small appetizers.  For my main dish, the grilled eggplant and kabab was amazing.  The waiters are great and super helpful.  I enjoyed chatting to a group of Syrian women at the next table.  The restraint interior is beautiful and on Friday night they have live Syrian music, which I enjoyed.  To top it off a nice bar and good wine too."}
{"text":"Food is OK but service was atrocious. We were in a big group for a birthday but don't take the reservation if you can't serve properly. We never received our menus . We had to look for their menu on our phone to order. We ask four times for pita. The first time was when we placed our order. By the time we received it, we had salad and the cold mezas were on the table, more or less 25-30 minutes. For pitas!!! The waitress also dropped a drink on us and did not even apologize. Final straw was when we ask what dessert was included at the end of the meal. She said she would find out. 15 minutes later, another waiter came with a dessert and saif it was the one included. My wife couldn't even eat that dessert because it was made with cheese. All in all, really bad service and the food was far from good enough to compensate for it."}
{"text":"Great food, the Armenian salad was excellent! I got it without too much spice and really enjoyed it. I went with the Kebbeh El Joz which was very good and the other Kebbeh looked tempting. I probably could have had three plates of those as my meal."}
{"text":"You would not be able to tell what a wonderful restaurant this is from the unremarkable area in which it's located. Once in the door you'll find an elegant, spacious place with an appealing modern decor that I assume is Syrian. The best part is the food. We had the Fattoush slad, Sajuk rolls, ad 2 different kebabs. All were outstanding along with the puffed pita. Service was great, too. I sincerely hope Beroya does well enough to survive until I return to Montreal."}
{"text":"I wanted to expand my tastebuds with a second visit to a Syrian restaurant. I had about 6-7 hot and cold Mazas . What a delight! I really enjoyed the Kebbeh Mabroumeh which is rolled instead of fried. The Fattoush Salad was a big disappointment. Was not fresh and was saturated by the dressing. The dessert was..as you can see I posted a picture, not inviting but it was so delicious. It's called Ghazel al Banat which is ice cream and cotton candy! Ended the evening with a green tea and mint! It seems like I'm flirting with food more than with men. Bahaha!"}
{"text":"I'm Originally from Syria but live in The USA We visit Laval very often. We were so Happy to see an authentic Syrian restaurant opening here in Laval.  fresh cuisine and good  portions reasonably priced. The decor has a Syrian touch and interesting The staff is great -definitely has variable number of customers but extremely hospitable,the owner as well is very friendly and willing to make you feel at home Thank you. This place is new and experimenting but the flavors and freshness different from anywhere else. Do your selves a favor and go try it."}
{"text":"A new Syrian themed resto opened up in Laval and after accumulating a few favorable reviews a group of us visited it to see what it was all about. So here's the rundown :   AMBIANCE : A few restos operated here the last few years and failed. Pylos was very Greek themed so when I walked in I was expecting it to be different but they really re-hauled the place to suit their needs. First thing I noticed were the cubicles, they are gone and a lot of big long tables were put in. The resto is clean, modern feeling with a distinct Arabic theme. The quality of decorations is very nice and aesthetic pleasing, all in all, impressive layout!  SERVICE : Since we got here on Saturday night it was relatively packed with a lot of large families celebrating events (thus the big tables!!). This resto is family friendly, so expect a lot of kids running around but there are areas for adults only. You can expect a lot of little legs running about in white dresses and tiny tuxes. Another thing to note is there were a lot of people here thus it made the experience a bit difficult to enjoy since it was soooooo loud from everyone talking. What didn't help was the really loud Arabic music blaring over us on top of that which I didn't feel it was necessary at all. Having a conversation at our own table required you to speak very loudly and the relief was welcomed when I left the resto. My poor ears.  The wait staff is friendly albeit somewhat passive. Speed was slow during the entire experience so expect to be here 2-3 hours for a dining experience. Extra wait staff on hand would certainly help as they were very busy! Notching down some points for only one water refill during my 2+ hour stay and it was only refilled nearly the end of the visit. Furthermore, we didn't get asked if we wanted more drinks/food/etc. This requires attention. Chasing waiters is not my type of preferred activity, so that area definitely needs improvement.  FOOD : Let's talk about the food! If you haven't eaten Syrian, it's a must as the experience is palpable. It doesn't differ too greatly if you've eaten Lebanese in the past... and I LOVE Lebanese food. Here's what I experienced and my rating per plate.  PIta Bread - (5 stars) Damn!!!! I love hot pita bread and I love how it looks like a big balloon of soft pita dough that somehow loves to find its way down your gullet. Yummy!  Fattouch - (4 stars) Mixed fresh vegetables and fried pita served with vinegar and pomegranate molasses seasoned with sumac. Salad-like shavings on top of the salad was nice. Lacked the acidic kick at the end of each bite I've grown to love eating this type of salad over the last few decades but hey.... still very good.  Sujuk rolls - (4 stars) Seasoned Minced meat with Syrian spices fried with pita bread. This was definitely a new experience for me as I'm used to Sujuk to be wet-like bowls with a dry spicy taste. The appetizer experience was welcomed and tasty.  Cheese rolls - (5 stars) Cheese baladi rolled in a crispy dough. Absolutely a must try, delicious!!! Imagine a fried egg roll filled with decadent cheese.  Fries - (2 stars) Garlic potatoes cut into small cubes with a garlic soup-like sauce. Potatoes were decent but the garlicky taste was weak, the soup-like mixture at the bottom made the potatoes at the bottom obviously mushy. Forgettable.  Chiche-taouk - (3 stars) Chicken marinated in our homemade sauce grilled on charcoal. The chicken was good, enjoyed the spices but it seems either Beroya can't do garlic right or the mixture Syrian cuisine uses for garlic is not for me. Garlic was weaksauce. Very creamy, did not taste the right amount of garlic. Average plate.  Halaewt el Jiben - (4 stars) Semolina and cheese pastry stuffed with Cream (achta) served with pistachios and sugar syrup. Very tasty and I always get sad when my plate is empty.  Bouza & Ghazel el Banat - (4 stars) Ice cream served with cotton candy and pistachios. The cotton candy looks weird at first since it looks like dog hair but it's quite tasty. Ice cream is not the conventional kind and it's an acquired taste. I liked it  Aryan (2 stars) - Yogurt mint drink. Small serving with almost no mint, didn't feel right for me, forgettable.  Wanted to try some falafel but they were out.... at 6 PM? I'm not a fan of things being on menus which you can't order.... also no olive plates, correct that please.  PRICE : We tried several plates and the final price tag divided among us made it an affordable experience ($35 each). Definitely recommend the hot and cold mezzes with a bunch of friends. They have a nice menu where you can order a number of items for $79 (dinner for 2) but we didn't feel inclined to order from the cold mezze. Value here isn't excellent but still pretty good.   CONCLUSION : 4 stars. I was concerned about a few menu items but I'm just picky about my garlic stuff (I'm a garlic snob?) but overall it's a good experience to try at least once. If you like Lebanese well.... try Syrian and bring friends!"}
{"text":"You're better of going to Alep on Jean Talon. Worth a try if you want to spend your money on trying. The meat is good, way too pricey for what they offer."}
{"text":"What an amazing Restaurant , finally we can say we have real Syrian and Lebanese food in Montreal ,not fast food or pretend to be Lebanese food . Living here for the last 31 years , never had Great food like this , great service and very well priced and amazing family environment   Good luck and wish you the best"}
{"text":"Best middle eastern restaurant in Laval and even in Canada  Food is amazing  Good vibe"}
{"text":"Nourriture excellente, expérience Syrienne exquise pour un prix plus que raisonnable. Bravo et longue vie. Mon restaurant préféré à Laval"}
{"text":"Tabbouleh was really good, made the right way, just the way my   ancestors made it for generations. Order the tabbouleh."}
{"text":"I was excited to hear that a new Syrian restaurant had just opened in Laval, could this a Damas in Laval.  After some research I realized it had opened at the old Jardinos restaurant next to Universe on St-Martin.   I went there a Sunday evening and I must say it was pretty full. It is very nicely decorated, With Arabic writing on black marble stones all around the restaurant,  The staff is very courteous, but it shows that it is a new restaurant, you feel like they are not 100% sure what to do, or what is expected of them. But in general very nice.  We had the sample dish which was 79$ for two people, you had 2 salad, 4 cold mezzes, and 4 hot mezzes, the main course was a plate of grilled meat and they finish you off with desert. My favorites were the fattouche salad, the hummus, and the cheese roll. The grilled meats were also very good, maybe a little spicy.  What I least liked was that they brought the salads, and all 8 mezzes together. I would have liked a slower service, maybe giving us so time to each part of the meal.  Now I must say that I am a little bias, as one of my all time favorite restaurant is Damas, and I was kinda hoping for the same taste and feel, but it definitely wasn't. But was it bad, not at all. I came to the conclusion that I cannot compare the two, Beroya, is much more affordable, more family oriented place where as Damas, is more romantic, more high end.  All in all it was a nice enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is fresh, authentic and delicious. The General Manager treated us very well, he recommend us some of the best dishes and the most suitable for big parties. We definitely recommend this place to anyone who's in the mood for authentic Syrian food."}
{"text":"It's going to be a short review  Everything was tasteful they know what they are doing we were very happy with the food except the cheese rolls dough is very thick and not crunchy , service is good ,   food is good everything is fairly prized . I hope in coming years they will not  sacrifice  the quality of the food I hope they keep it the same because most of the new middle eastern restaurants when they first open they give you a good quality food after they build there customers they start to sacrifice from the quality .we will definitely go back"}
{"text":"It was ok, nothing too special and would not specifically look forward to going there again. This being said, there was nothing really wrong with the food or the service, but there was nothing to get excited about either. On the more critical side, I found the place pretty loud with lots of kids running around unsupervised. By 11 PM, many kids were passed out on chairs randomly across the restaurant.  The food was just OK for people used to high quality Lebanese or Syrian food, so if you are native from that region, this would leave you unimpressed. But the average non-middle eastern who has never experienced this type of food would find this experience pretty pleasant. For about $60 per person, I'd give it a \"meh\"."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever, staff was very rude and service was really slow and bad, don't recommend it at all"}
{"text":"The best restaurant in the greater Montreal area for Mediterranean and Syrian/Lebanese food.  Very authentic fine cuisine with consistently high quality fresh prepared food. I tried most of the menu and they're all delicious from the meza to the main plates to the desert. You cannot go wrong with anything at Beroya. For people who want to try a bit of everything, I recommend ordering \"degustation Beroya\" that has hot and cold mezze, mixed grill platter, and desert.  Cold mezza include hummus, baba ghannoug, mhamara, labneh among others.  Hot mezza include kibbeh, cheese rolls, etc.  The mixed grill include kafta, chicken, and filet.  For those who like the kibbeh nayyeh, they will like it at Beroya. It's so tasty with the right spices!  For desert, halawit jibn is a favorite.  The place can accommodate large parties. The staff is so friendly and they have live amazing oriental music on Friday and Saturday night (not sure about other weeknights).  It's so popular that it's fully packed on most days of the week, especially the weekends. I recommend calling in to make a reservation or to make sure that they can accommodate you before showing up."}
{"text":"it was my second time for syrian food and both in  weeks. i would have given 5 stars if i had not been at Damas. although it cost half of damas so was the taste.  service was good as well as the portion. i esp liked the dips and lamb chops. every thing else was good."}
