{"text":"I went to grab take-out around 7pm on a Tuesday and then went back around the same time the next day! The line is usually filled with people who work in the financial district who are working late. The portion sizes are small for the price, but hey, that's what you get in the downtown core- especially in the PATH. The service was quick, and the sushi good. A nice dinner to have from your desk!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for sushi near work. I go there at least once a week. I am hooked on the salmon poke bowl. It is very busy at lunch time, so I order using the Ritual app. I go so often they asked my name anymore ."}
{"text":"This team has got to be the most well oiled machine in the PATH concourse.. Everyone there is so nice, so efficient and fast.. The sushi is delicious and I love how the rice layer is not super thick like alot of places.. They're generous with the ingredients and everything is flavourful and fresh.. Try the teriyaki bombs.. super addicting.. Love the poke bowls too.. my go to spot in the PATH"}
