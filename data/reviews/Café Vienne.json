{"text":"It's o.k., but just o.k. Food is under-seasoned. Decent variety of offerings considering it is only open for breakfast & lunch, but just so so. Clean, neat decor. cool jazz playing most of the time. comfortable and relaxed. 
Prices aren't cheap. A can of pop will set you back $2, and a sandwich about $6-7 (without extras)."}
{"text":"Spacieux, lumineux, wifi gratuit, service souriant et rapide, qui sait reconnaître ses habitués. 

On regrette les heures d'ouverture uniquement calquées sur les horaires des compagnies domiciliées au 5800 St.-Denis. C'est donc aussi fermé en fin de semaine. 

Enfin, on ne peut que constater la catastrophe nucléaire que ce genre d'établissement représente sur le plan diététique, même si ce n'est pas propre au Café Vienne, bien entendu."}
{"text":"Les prix sont exagérés, la qualité des plats vendus laisse à désirer et le personnel n'est pas très amical. Le café goûte rien, surtout quand tu le bois noir et ils refusent souvent de te servir des plats déjeuner après 11 h."}
{"text":"It's ok! It's handy having it there near the library and metro, and Herve is exactly right, the huge windows and free wifi make for a chill space to spend some time, especially in the winter when we need those sunshine vitamins! The woman who works here the majority of the times that I've passed by is a total sweetheart who recognizes every regular and has a professional attitude and kind smile. 

The food and coffee is Café Vienne standard, these spots are basically equivalent to Second Cups these days ie; truly not great. I like the oatmeal cookies which remind me of my high school cafeteria, and the corsé filter coffee ain't good, but it ain't bad!"}
{"text":"This is a nice cafe on the ground floor of a former textile factory turned office building.  i can't speak for the quality of the coffee, as I don't drink coffee, but the food is good, and fairly reasonably priced.  In addition to standard deli sandwiches they have several vegetarian sandwich and meal options, as well as a nice variety of desserts.

Free wifi is available upon request, and the cafe has it's own restrooms inside.

The cafe is only open during normal business hours, Monday to Friday."}
{"text":"Can't even get a decent soup and sandwich. Sandwich wasn't bad, there just wasn't anything good about. The soup is watered down canned soup they refill with green beans to lower food cost and still charge you more. The Sprite was OK. Never going back. Sadly the only restaurant in my office building."}
