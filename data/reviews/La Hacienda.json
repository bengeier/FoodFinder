{"text":"We came here for dinner and we loved the atmosphere. The bartender was nice and made us non alcoholic drinks which were very good I  had the Pomegrante mojito very tasty. We had the beet salad which was good and the lobster tacos which were an appetizer and very good."}
{"text":"Stopped in to check it out - the service was excellent and very attentive. Happy hour seven days a week with good options. We were just in for a drink and snack but the fresh guacamole was good and the beans are great. Will definitely be back for a full meal!"}
{"text":"I've been a loyal customer for 15 years. I've even moved out of the state back again out of the city and have made sure that La Hacienda has been a staple on my food tours whenever I'm in town. However today marks the last time I will ever patronize this establishment. First off the drinks and food hasn't been the best as the years have gone by but there's something about nostalgia that keeps you going back. That said, today the service was awful, the food was ok and the drinks better than the last time I was there, but we were given a bill that wasn't ours. We didn't realize, as yes it seemed cheap but ultimately was a matter of $15 difference, we paid and were  leaving tip when the waiter curtly said I gave you the wrong bill and then presented a bill that was illegible and hand written  with a different amount in it. We went to the front to clarify and ask that they go over the bill to ensure it was clear and the hostess was rude and flustered and void of understanding as to why this all would be frustrating. She wasn't interested in our frustration, she was unhelpful, and didn't care whether we continued to frequently the establishment. Needless to say we won't be back ever and it's unfortunate that 15 years of my money went into a resutarant that doesn't value customer service."}
{"text":"The steak Burrito Chico (smaller version of the Grande) is amazing.  The guacamole is disappointing.  The service is friendly and the prices are dirt cheap.  Definitely a bargain and quite tasty."}
{"text":"I eat here about twice a month for lunch. The daily specials are great, the price is right for the food and atmosphere. It's quick enough for a lunch hour and it's a great meal with chips and salsa. Salsa is a bit on the spicy side but it's delicious. Servers have always been very polite and helpful. I really like the tomatillo sauce on the Enchilada Suiza. Great Food, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have been going to La Hacienda regularly for about 5 years.  Within that time, the service has gotten to be deplorable.  I went in today, was seated and given a menu. About 30 seconds later, my waiter came to take my order.  I told him that I needed another minute. Three other tables then came into the restaurant.  My menu is now closed on my table, but the waiter gets water for all three other tables and takes their orders before even glancing my way again.  I left.  I doubt if I will be back. There are way too many other Mexican options in Madison to put up with this kind of service."}
{"text":"If you want Mexican food in Madison this is the best place for it. It has a traditional mexican restaurant feel and has outstanding food. The service is great and the people are friendly. If you like fajitas all of them are really good and big enough to share with a friend."}
{"text":"2nd time in a row that the service was terrible. Sat for 15 minutes before our server made his way over. Long waits for the waiter to order drinks/food. The food is always excellent, however, the vibe of \"we don't give a ....\" is too much. We wont be going back, and we will make sure to tell our friends/colleagues. For the price, the service should be Four Season quality. This isn't the Four Seasons."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant in Chandler! I have been here multiple times now and every time I've had some different, and so far everything has been delicious. There is definitely real Mexican flavor in here."}
{"text":"Overpriced and mediocre food. I am Mexican and the food was did not meet my expectations. Soup was cold and enchiladas were average at best. Service was not great which surprised me considering I was in a resort. When the bill came saw that a 20% tip was automatically added to the bill which explained why waiter didn't care.  Needless to say I won't be coming back and I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"I went there for their weekday lunch buffet. As others had mentioned, it's clearly a made-over restaurant from some other chain -- dark wood paneling with some Mexican paintings on the walls and plastic decorations from the rafters. The booth, while serviceable, had plastic seats which had been torn and repaired with some kind of vinyl tape on top. So this is not the place for ambiance.  Unlike others, I found  the service quite good. I was seated almost immediately, the table was kept clear, the waiter came back regularly to check on things. I noticed that the buffet was continually being refreshed, and never ran out of anything. However, there place was not crowded, so I don't know if that was a factor.  Nothing was marked -- one of my major annoyances with any buffet. However, I grabbed a passing waiter and he cheerfully walked through every dish explaining what it was. If I recall, there was chicken fajitas, some spicy beef strips, shredded chicken, taco meat, beef burrito, chicken burrito, chicken enchilada, chicken taquito, roasted chicken, chili relleno (beef), cheese quesadilla, some kind of pork vegetable soup, tortillas, chips, taco shells, taco salad shells and the usual taco fillings (cheese, sour cream, guacamole, various salsas (all spicy), jalapenos (not spicy), shredded lettuce). Rice and refried beans. Watermelon and orange pieces for desert. All of it was passing -- not great Mexican food, pretty bland. Frankly, I think the spicy chicken burrito, various types of bean and cheese burritos, and 7-layer burritos at Taco Bell taste better. But if you like chips and taco stuff, then it's a pretty good place.  It gets the four stars as a relative marking -- good service, mediocre food, cheap price. At a higher price, the rating would start dropping.  One last comment: while La Hacienda is in Century III mall, you can only get into it from an outside door. The mall is sealed off on the inside where the restaurant is located (though it still shows on the mall's directory). If you get to a blank wall next to Foot Locker where the map says the restaurant is located, just go outside the little exit door next to Foot Locker and go around the outside to get in."}
{"text":"Terrible service  and one of the worst dining experience . Our servers didn't seem to care or were interested in taking care of our large group of 6 adults 4 teens. The soup were served without spoons took a good 15 mins to get the spoons by which time the soup was cold. Gauc was made table side and had no flavor. Over priced and lousy service ruined a great family get together during the holidays. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. 2 stars for good -10 for service and attitude! !"}
{"text":"flavorful, gourmet, worth-your-money Spanish/Mexican food! 5/5  I was blown away by the wonderful, delicious meal from La Hacienda last weekend. We started the meal with platter of fried cheese and spinach salad. They were good! For entree, I got a huge plate of sucking pig with thick, creamy sauce on the side. J got a steak. Both of our entree was just delicious! Of course, we each ordered a glass of La Hacienda margarita. They are to die-for! Thick, sour, sweet, lemon-ish margarita. For dessert, we had a glass of banana, creamy rice pudding topped with caramel... great grand finale for a great dinner."}
{"text":"I had to find out what this restaurant was all about when my wife told me she couldn't wait to go (she has been here before). I don't eat mexican food, I don't generally like it and lived all these years not thinking mexican food could be this good. The fajitas were great, the guacamole appetizer was unlike any I've had before. I would describe it as gourmet mexican food. Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"With the number of top-notch authentic mexican eateries surround La Hacienda, I don't remember much of my experiences here to be honest. The few times I have been here are because my friends really wanted their meat platter and I am too lazy/tired to disagree with them.   So that said, their meat platters are good for groups. You get a tonne of meat to share amongst your friends, and it does fill you up significantly. As in most mexican restaurants you get your complimentary serving of chips and salsa upon seating, and feel free to ask for more if you so desire.   There isn't a whole lot I have to say about them. If I am in the area or if I am looking for mexican food this is not my top choice. There is nothing bad about La Hacienda. They serve decent food, the service is good and the ambience/layout etc is cool. As a matter of fact there is just too much competition around the vicinity. Tough luck..."}
{"text":"The steak from this place is amazing and the margaritas are strong and delicious."}
{"text":"went here instead of the old fashion as a substitute, i would say its an average place. i had orded the shrimp fijita, i would say its pretty good for a price of $11. it is something that ya could make at home for a few dollars extra that would last you probably two days. the gf seems to like the chicken tamale that they had. she said it was nice and moist compared to pedros, where we went the other week. which was dry. the wait staff was pretty attentive, the environment was pretty clean. i couldn't complain."}
{"text":"We ate here New Year's Day for dinner.  The server was rude when my daughter did not bring her id.  He told her if the \"appetizer\" she ordered was not enough as an entree, the soup could be brought out fast, but he never asked her again if she wanted the soup.  Her appetizer was over-cooked.  The rice that came with my chicken poblano was so over-cooked you could stick a fork in it and lift most of it up.  He brought me a new bowl of rice but I had to flag him down to get his attention.  The fried plantains were so over-cooked, they could not be cut with the knife.  I did not bother to ask for replacements.  My meal never should have left the kitchen. Some of the appetizer guacamole spilled on the table, but no one cleaned it up, although the server saw it, as did the water server.  The server was even cautious not to put the bill on it.  To top off the mediocre meal, they were out of the dessert we ordered, but the server didn't know it until he came back from the kitchen to tell us. It was just a disappointment.  We came from another resort to try this place because of the reviews. It just seemed like the place didn't care about the service or the food."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of tequilas.  Food is consistent and delicious.  Very authentic sauces add a different flair to each dish. The menu has a wide variety of choices from fresh fish and meats to more traditional dishes.  Wonderful atmosphere.  Outdoor seating is delightful."}
{"text":"Had really good fajita type meal and tummy margaritas! The staff was quick and pleasant, highly recommend"}
{"text":"How does this place not have 5 stars?!?  The food is spicy like real Mexican food should be, made to order, in perfectly-sized portions, and at extremely affordable prices. The service is friendly and ridiculously fast. The space itself is enormous and open, so there's always tables available. And they almost never close.   I've lived in Houston, Texas, Jackson, Mississippi, and visited Arizona and California several times. And I've never had Mexican as good as this little joint in Madison, Wisconsin. Go here!"}
{"text":"The food here was really good and very big portions which makes for  delicious leftovers the next day. My husband's margaritas were tasty and strong. Our server Armando was very friendly and the bill was pleasing also."}
{"text":"Use to like coming here when staying at the Princess, but this place sucks. Outrageously overpriced for the quality. Guacamole sampler was horrible and the shrimp on the entree dish weren't fresh. Bill for 2 people with 4 margaritas was $150 without tip. Ripoff"}
{"text":"We ate her twice memorial weekend. First time we sat in bar and had drinks and apps. The table side guacamole is VERY good. The Margaritas are very very good.  The menu looked so good we came back two nights later for dinner. It lived up to what we expected. Everything, service, drinks, and food was on point. I suggest getting the guacamole and chips to start. You will have to have waiter remove them because it is hard to put them down. The ceviche is different but delicious and worth trying as well.  It was hard to choose a dinner because it all looked so good but I chose the tenderloin over enchilada's and it did not disappoint me at all. If your in Scottsdale try this place"}
{"text":"The guacamole is very good.... that's it. Everything else is pretty bland. The chips and taco shells taste like store bought generics. The prices are high for the quality and quantity. Just can't make an argument to recommend this place. Unless you like fresh guacamole only...."}
{"text":"La Hacienda is one of the dining options inside  the super classy Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Resort. It provides a very unique flavor of modern mexican cuisine which is oh so fresh and delicious.It is surprisingly light compared to what one would expect from traditional mexican cuisine. Would highly recommend.   A friend and I went for dinner during the weekend but were still surprised to see it was decently crowded. We didnt have reservations but were promptly seated. The complimentary chips and salsa were really good but the star was the fresh guacomole that is prepared at the table . It is one of the freshest and tastiest i have ever had.  For the main course my friend ordered the tuna and I had the crab enchillada and both were great . The presnetation of the food was also good .  For dessert we shared the tres leches with strawberry salsa which was so fresh and flavorful.  Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Le restaurant est superbe! Définitivement la meilleure bouffe mexicaine que j'ai eu l'occasion de manger. Nous avons commencer avec la guacamole qui est préparée devant nous. Vraiment excellent! Portion parfaite à partager pour deux personnes en entrée. Attention à la sauce aux ghost peppers! Le service est un peu brusque.... Disons que le plat principal arrive avant que nous ayons eu le temps de nous remettre de notre entrée... Le service est typiquement américain mais la nourriture est des plus mexicaine. Une valeur sûre bien qu'un peu cher."}
{"text":"Best late-night (especially when drunk) food in Madison. The hot plate-I forget the actual name because I'm usually drunk when I eat it-is THE best. The meat is delicious.  The sides of rice/beans/guacamole are nothing to write home about, but they get the job done."}
{"text":"La Hacienda is one of the best - if not the best Mexican restaurant in town. Casual dining. Good prices. Helpful staff. I have been eating here for years and I highly recommend the place. My favorites are the enchiladas, nachos, or fajitas. I hear the margaritas are amazing as well. The decor is sub par - and the salsa isn't my favorite but, overall La Hacienda is delicious!"}
{"text":"Sure, it's pricey for Mexican, but keeping in mind it's located within a 5 star resort it's par for the course. That however is where the normalcy ends... Fantastic food, probably the best Mexican in town. Filet is incredible. Guac is as good as it gets. I've never had a bad bite of food here. The flaming coffees I literally crave on a regular basis. The service has always been great and the GM is first class. I've had a couple issues with a lost reservation once  and a long wait on another occasion during a busy time and he always accommodated us in a very friendly and proffesional manner and he made us feel very welcomed and  \"noticed\" if that makes sense. This should be commonplace in a restaurant that commands such a high dollar, but it's always amazing to me how seldom that really is the case. La hacienda is a wonderful experience from front to back every time I've been.   Highlights: - guacamole - filet  -tequila selection - service  - flaming coffees  Ambiance: super homey old AZ vibe. Beautiful decor."}
{"text":"Delicious food, best I've found in the valley.  If they made homemade flour tortillas it'd put this way over the top."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Guacamole was fresh and tasty. Salsa delicious. Innovative Mexican food.  Fish was fresh, meats delicious and everything was done well."}
{"text":"I am beyond impressed with this restaurant.  From the moment we walked in until we left my husband and I were blown away by the level of service and the amazing food. Our server, Angel was absolutely amazing. He made excellent recommendations and although we were full, we still ended up ordering dessert (which of course he was absolutely on point with the churros.) Even the manager Ryan came by to say hello and ask how everything was. That was the icing on the cake. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you love Mexican, this could be some of the best you'll have. Not only will you be dining in a beautiful resort atmosphere, you'll also receive some of the best service around. Very impressed with the service, cuisine, and overall dining experience."}
{"text":"We used to frequent this place for lunch about 10 years ago. Had dinner this evening and good was mediocre at best. Chips and guacamole were bland. Food was Americanized. The chicken in the enchiladas was dry. Had to douse with lime and pico de gallo. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Arrived in Madison late last night so we were looking for some food (around 10:30pm) and this place was recommended. The staff was super friendly and our waiter was hilarious.  I had the \"combonacion\" which included a ground beef taco (corn tortilla, cilantro, onion), a cheese quesadilla and a steak tostada with Spanish rice and beans. Everything tasted like authentic Mexican cuisine. The only downside was they did not have flan that day.  I would definitely return here if I was in the area again. Food, service and atmosphere were all enjoyable."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican places to go! Food, service, ambiance are fabulous! A must! However it is a bit pricy but well worth it!"}
{"text":"We were looking a good example of quality Mexican food in the local area. We found it here. It may not be a fancy restaurant but that's ok because the food and service were awesome. The enchilada style burrito with chorizo was spot on. I love little hole in the wall places that are like this. Food was a great price. We looked at over 25 restaurants for good food that won't break the bank. I feel like people only think food is good around here if it costs a ton of money. This place destroys that myth."}
{"text":"I left mad...  mad at the fact that I had filled up and couldn't finish my food 'cause it was so damn good.    I came down here to AZ for a wedding at the Princess and was on a mission to try some of the \"legendary\" southwestern food that all of the transplants from AZ rave about up in Seattle.  I was skeptical about this place as it was hotel food; however, I rolled the dice and won.    The tortilla soup was completely different from what I was used to (more savory), and it was fantastic.  The fillet a la parilla was to die for.  The coconut tres leches was probably the second best tres leches that I've ever had in my life, which is saying a lot since I'm a tres leches wh*re.  Too bad I was too stuffed to eat it all... argh...  Oh, and even the salsa for the chips was surprisingly good (nice when a place doesn't overlook the little things).  As a juxtaposition, I hit a few more SW-style spots while down here and none of them came close to this place."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their shredded beef enchiladas and a cheese enchilada.  Their red sauce had some flavor to it, which I have missed at other restaurants.  I got their near 5PM so there were few patrons, but the service was fast and polite.  The chips were warm, crisp, and very fresh.  The portions were not overwhelming, which I appreciate."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my boyfriend and we were both beyond happy with our service and our food! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My son took me here and I was thrilled about the food. It's authentic Mexican food at it's best not TexMex like chain places. I had this kind of food when I lived in the San Diego area many years ago and haven't really found anything even close to it. The tamales are for sure homemade and the burrito was huge and tasted great!  If you love authentic Mexican food then do yourself a favor go try it out. But if TexMex is what you are looking for don't bother it's not a Chipoltes. I've been back 3times the last month."}
{"text":"I paid $34 for shrimp & chicken fajitas that I could have got a Apple Bees.. Chicken was dry and cheap meat.. Only enough guacamole for one fajita. Veggies weren't fully sautéed and looked like they came out of a frozen bag instead of freshly chopped.. Disappointed especially for that cost"}
{"text":"I really can't rate this restaurant because we were not able to try it. My sister made reservations for dinner on her birthday and called the day of to confirm. She called twice and both times they left her on hold. The 2nd time a lady picked up and took her number to call her back with a confirmation. No one ever called her back so we went to another restaurant for her celebration.  Today, a lady called her from the restaurant to ask if her reservation was for  yesterday or today, when my sister said yesterday she went on about how my sister made her day and thanked her so much - not knowing the previous ordeal and hung up. Very disappointing service all around."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best mexican food in Arizona, and since we were staying on property we decided to do some tequila tasting as well.  We just did app's for food.  The guacamole is truly the best we've had.  The taco trio is great, we prefer the carnitas over the other two so we always ask for 3 carnitas.  The steak quesadilla is small but super tasty.  We tried several Anejo tequilas, and surprising found a new favorite.  The Tres Amigos, which is actually George Clooneys tequila was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Our waitress was excellent. The atmosphere was fun and relaxed. The red headed hostess at the front door was a little rude with poor people skills.  My husband and I went on a Saturday night. We didn't make reservations but we called ahead and we're told that the bar was open seating/first come first serve. We started with the traditional guacamole which was delicious (of course it is expensive for guacamole but you have to expect that being on the Fairmont property), it was a perfect way to start our meal. I ordered the pacific halibut which was served on top of a Mexican quinoa salad which was full of flavor. My husband ordered the Filet a la Parilla based on the recommendation of the waitress and ordered it to be cooked by the chefs choice. He let me have a taste and it was cooked perfectly. We finished with the churros.. they were warm and light. A perfect finish to our Mexican meal."}
{"text":"Excellent. Great tequila choices. Unbelievable margaritas and plenty of staff for speedy good service. Fun drink specialties but perhaps the highlight is the freshly made at your table guacamole of goodness. A wood fire crackled near by as we enjoyed very good shrimp ceviche and the short rib for our entrée."}
{"text":"affectionately termed \"la hot-rear-end-a\" by some - this place serves the craving for mexican cuisine, later at night.  way better than the traditional taco fast food franchises.  the ambience pretty much sucks, but the food is cheap and tastes decent.  definitely wouldn't hit this place up for a romantic dinner, but it's certainly an adequate stop for a low-key lunch."}
{"text":"I gave it a 3 for ambiance.  The reviews were very misleading.  This place is very expensive!!  I'm talking $90 for mini appetizers & a couple of drinks.  There is no way Mexican food should cost this much!  The beef was full of big pieces of fat.  However, the guacamole was good and fresh.  Overall, pretty restaurant but the food is not worth the price."}
{"text":"Sorry to say there were 5 in our party and none of us liked our food. All was tasteless and/or tasted like vinegar.    Spoke to other hotel guests who had equally bad food.  Beautiful restaurant but the food is awful. Service was great from our waiter. Bad food took forever to arrive."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Will definitely go here again.. Staff was really helpful and generous.  The chicken mocajete was bountiful and could be altered to be more spicy if preferred . Quite the find!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have always loved and recommended this place, however today it was a bit disappointing... Happy hour menu has changed a bit, it used to be 2 tacos for 5 bucks now it's 1 taco for 4 bucks, specialty margaritas ( prickly pear and el diablo which are prepared with pineapple and serrano infused tequila) are no longer in the happy hour menu, neither was the tequila flight with the BEST SANGRITA I ever had, these drinks used to be 5 buck, now they only have beers and classic margarita and they're 6 bucks... time to start going elsewhere! :("}
{"text":"Perfect!  Great real gourmet Mexican food, great atmosphere, good service.  An upscale place but they do have a kids menu and plastic cups so still go even if you can't find a sitter.  Some reviews say the dress code is dressy; the wait staff wears nice jeans and black polos, so similar for the guests is fine.  It's on par with Rosa Mexicano in DC and NYC, Tamayo in Denver and Maya in SF.  If you like gourmet Mexican it's a must.  The corn soup with huitlacoche, the chicken mole, and the pork shoulder were some of our favorites.  The organic margerita and guacamole are also great. It's pricey; entrees 26-32, the organic Marg was 13; but worth it!  A huge tequila menu.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was good but that was about it. Served incorrect food and had offers to correct but were never corrected. Sat with empty drinks after initial drinks throughout the rest of the meal. Extremely disappointing after positive reviews"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison.  My daughter and I visit La Hacienda pretty much weekly. I LOVE the Enchilada Suiza. Although I usually fill up on chips and pico before the meal. I crave the pico. Spicy and chunky, definately not out of a jar. Add a blended lime margarita to my order, and I am one happy gal! Other favorites: Chorizo tostada, chicken quesadilla on flour tortilla, shrimp fajitas, all queso fundido, and combination azteca. Also shout out to the waitstaff, very friendly, and I have never been dis-satisfied with anything they bring to my table. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious and creative Mexican. Guacamole was outstanding and Tuna cerviche as an appetizer was superb. Only negative was oversalted Skirt Steak. Service was excellent...would definetely recommend!"}
{"text":"La Hacienda is one of four restaurants located in the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Resort. Here are some comments:  Pros: convenient location for those staying at the resort, lots of seating, friendly staff, fast service  So-so: quality of food (since this \"Mexican\" restaurant is located in a resort, expect \"Americanized\" food that won't be overly flavourful or spicy)  Cons: the pricing is absolutely absurd for the quality and quantity received. I understand that the resort will charge a premium, a few examples of the rip off pricing are as follows from their dinner menu (http://www.scottsdaleprincess.com/var/cdev_base/storage/original/application/f48c77ba109d108991e0ec6df188a527.pdf):  Appetizer Tacos de Langosta/Carnitas priced at $19 and $14 respectively - for this price you get 3 soft \"tacos\" that are no more than 3.5\" in diameter  Guacamole ranges from $14-$20 depending on which one you order.  Sopa de Elote priced at $10 - for this price you get a most, 1 \"cup\" (250mL) of soup  Filet a la Parilla priced at $36 - for this price you get a piece of meat that's about the size of 3 golf balls  Additional refried beans or rice are priced at $6 each, and extra tortillas will set you back an additional $4.  I found the \"Spilt Entree Charge\" at $5 to be extremely preposterous. This isn't a \"fine dining\" restaurant and this $5 charge is just another example of price gouging at this resort (other examples include paying $4 for a double espresso at the hotel gift shop, when street pricing is about $2.25, and $18 for a tube of sunscreen that anywhere else would be under $10).  I can't say I can recommend this restaurant since the cost isn't inline with what you get on your plate. The food isn't authentic Mexican cuisine and you'll leave with a lot less in your wallet."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years, but that ends today. I took my boyfriend here because I have always enjoyed the food and he hadn't been there yet. We placed a to-go order and attempted to order the chips and salsa to-go as listed on the menu. The owner informed us that he would NOT be able to honor the menu price of $3.70 for a lg and that we would be charged $6.50 instead. I showed him the menu and he just shrugged his shoulders. We did not get the chips and salsa because I refuse to support what I perceive to be a dishonest owner. While waiting for our food I stewed over how we were treated and upon the completion of our order I again brought the situation up to the owner. I explained that it was my understanding that it is illegal to not honor an advertised price. I was told he was sorry and that was it. He never offered an explanation about why I wouldn't be charged $3.70 for chips that would have been free if we dined in. Also, when we arrived home I discovered that I received rice instead of the beans I'd ordered. Great. I am disheartened by the experience because my boyfriend and I agreed that the food was good and reasonably priced. However, I will no longer support their business because I do not believe they care about the satisfaction of their customers and that causes to question the integrity of their entire operation."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Fairmont and ate here twice and enjoyed both meals. The setting is beautiful and reminded me of the cover of the album \"Hotel California\" The Margaritas were some of the best that I have had as was the Guacamole Fest and the steak was delicious. Great service and a good wine list."}
{"text":"Well, we've been here every week since I posted my last review.  Menu has changed slightly but the quality has not.  I wouldn't recommend the squash blossom app but they have added their guac fest guacamole to the regular menu and those are absolutely fabulous.  I tried their chipotle mango margarita and it was awesome (but no longer on the menu), the elderflower margarita is also awesome - so much so we went out and bought a bottle of St. Germain.  I know I mentioned it in my last review but it deserves repeating, the short rib entree is absolutely unbelievable.  Mole is great too.  2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 margaritas = around $200 with tip - a good deal for what you're getting."}
{"text":"First time here, as a result of a weekend getaway from out of state.  Definitely wanted to try some GOOD Mexican food while in town and was recommended this place.  So glad I made a reservation (via Open Table) for a Saturday night.  Being at the Fairmont, I had somewhat higher expectations and surely enough, I was not disappointed.  The quality of both the service and the foods were a good representation of La Hacienda's claim  of being Arizon'a Best Mexican restaurant for the past 7 years!  Would definitely come back and try other menu items and gladly recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but the best part is the desert coffees.  They are delicious and the table side preparation is an entertaining experience."}
{"text":"We went to La Hacienda last night for dinner - it came highly recommended by a friend of ours who works at The Princess (thank you Sarah!). We were a little uncertain since it seemed a little pricey for Mexican food (there's a Mexican food restaurant on just about every corner in AZ), but since we are staying at the resort, we decided to try it. We are so happy we did! If you come here, get something worth trying that you won't find on other menus (don't get your standard tacos, fajitas, or enchiladas). Our server was very helpful and offered excellent suggestions.  We started with the Pepitas Guacamole - not your typical guac. They add veggies, pepitas, and other ingredients to make it extra delicious and different. The salsa that comes with it was amazing too!  For entrees we shared a steak dish, Tampiquena, as well as the Carnitas. Although Carnitas is something you can find in many places, this one was fantastic. Our server highly recc as his favorite dish :) Our favorite was the Tampiquena steak. The Tampiquena comes with a cheese enchilada covered in mole sauce. I'm not a fan of Mole sauce, but my fiancé absolutely loved it. The sauce was only on the cheese enchilada so it didn't alter the deliciousness of the steak for me. I also loved the Habanero Slaw that came with the Carnitas. Yumm!!  I guess our entrees took longer than the chef wanted so he gave us a complimentary dessert - Tres Leches cake! We didn't actually notice the wait, but appreciated the kind gesture. We were stuffed so we took it to go and ate it for breakfast :)   Drinks: we had been drinking by the pool all day so we just went with cervezas. I had a Tecate, Michelada style, and it was perfect! My fiancé had a Negro Modelo.   Overall, great ambiance and prices weren't bad for a restaurant at a five-star resort. We enjoyed everything so much we would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Absolute zero for service. We waited nearly an hour after ordering and never got our food. We left and will never go back."}
{"text":"I judge most Mexican Restaurants first on their salsa.  This place has GREAT salsa and the food was just as amazing.  A must try!!! We now drive out of our way to come here to eat.    TV inside if your a sports fan & small outside patio.   Service has been great every time."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour Menu and wonderful staff and service.  The Happy Hour Menu now takes place from 4pm to 6pm.  Go with a couple of friends so you can share all the good food and drinks.  The La Hacienda and Prickley pear margaritas are really good.  If you are willing to try something new other than your normal Tequila ask for Danielle, the Tequila Goddess, she is a wealth of knowledge and she will definitely guide you in the right direction.  Try the Don Julio 1942 tequila, its a sipper not straight shot so enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"I really wish Yelp would add a -star rating, that would save a lot of typing. If you like out of the can, bland, slightly sweet food and you have to much money to care, this is your spot. Regular lunch specials are priced from $10 +, not really competitively priced considering some other local choices with cheaper specials and better food with larger portions. Not authentic by any means. Even the \"spicy salsa\" was sweet as was the regular salsa which was pretty much watery tomato mush.  As the unofficial municipal lunch coordinator my coworkers and many other City employees as well as a large family and many friends depend on my recommendations of Chandler area restaurants simply because I (we) eat out a lot. This place does have one daily highlighted lunch special for around $8, it was the taco plate this day. One person opted for that special and was not impressed. Hard shells right out of the tacobell box, a small scoop of bland rice and a very small portion of unremarkable beans. Another ordered the burrito special, shredded beef and received the ground beef and for the sake of trying it he didn't send it back, big mistake. Not only was it wrapped in a very small taco size flour tortilla, you can tell it was wrapped cold and then some sort of beef mush reminicent of Jack in the box tacos with sugar, was added to warm it through, barely. Another ordered the chili relleno special, again, small bland and definitely not worth the $10+. If your in to the bland Americanized type of Mexican food with a sweet tooth and don't mind paying more than things are worth then this your spot. The only plus was the service. We were seated promptly, mostly because it was empty, with a smile and drinks were delivered quickly."}
{"text":"We have been here many times and have always enjoyed this restaurant.  We came last Saturday with our family and everything we ordered was beyond our expectation.  We ordered the lobster taco's, guacamole, enchilada's with the filet and they have a great assortment of fine tequila's.  We highly recommend this restaurant and sitting outside for the ambience!  Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible experience!  Our party of four had an amazing dining experience at La Hacienda last night. Wow.   We started with tableside guacamole, highly recommended. Then we had a killer Tequila flight, followed up with Maestro Doebel margaritas, another wow, a must-try.   The ladies enjoyed the salmon, I had the Pork Carnitas, and my friend had the lamb. All dishes were superb.   My wife also enjoyed a Cafe Acapulco, which was prepared on a rolling cart with a fire display. So cool!  The service was absolutely wonderful, and Ryan the General Manager was kind enough to visit our table and make excellent recommendations.   La Hacienda is a hidden jewel, and I highly recommend a visit. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"the \"grilled\" vegetables were limp and steam-cooked. the vegetarian fajitas had bits of shredded chicken in them. the rice was this weird rice-a-roni take-off on \"spanish\" rice. yuck. maybe the meat dishes are decent, but the vegetarian dishes were at best mediocre. i can cook better stuff at home."}
{"text":"I think there are better places to get Mexican food in Madison, and even in the general area. Yes, the service is decent and the food is cheap (and that's why I gave this place more than one star), but you definitely get what you pay for - the food did not seem very high quality and tasted pretty bland to me. I feel like I could make better Mexican food at home (and I am not even that well versed in Mexican cooking)."}
{"text":"For a high end restaurant mediocre food. Don't waste your money here. Meat was dry, vegetables were raw that the waiter described as El dente."}
{"text":"Chips salsa and water were delivered immediately! Followed by a delicious banana berry Margarita garnished with an orange. I ordered 3 mini chimichangas which came with beans rice lettuce and tomato and a lime. Perfectly garnished with a sour cream was more than enough for me ended up taking half of it home. When I asked for a to-go box the waiter jokingly said \"No, you have to finish it all here. \"  Ten minutes later I'm still waiting for my to-go box?.?. The waiter came and apologized and brought me the to-go box. I will definitely be back this was a great experience."}
{"text":"Slightly above average Mexican food (burritos are good) and very inattentive staff. HARDLY ANY PARKING IN BACK. Don't make this your first choice if you're on Park and looking for food.  4:30 on a hot Saturday, the staff is overworking themselves running to and from table with water and extra chips for people, asking if we are OK without taking any empty plates away -- if they were more observant with their tables, this wouldn't be an issue.  I had to wipe my phone off before writing this because a waiter spilled water all over it while refilling my water."}
{"text":"Combination fajitas steak and shrimp were excellent - juicy and the large shrimp was outstanding.  Green sauce was outstanding.  Nice portions."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a nice sit down place. Somewhere that we haven't eaten before. I took a chance and made reservations at this place. We started out with the queso fundido for an appetizer and it was so good! The food was out quickly and was freaking AH-Mazing!! I had the enchiladas verdes and the chicken practically melted in my mouth! The serving sizes are great and are very well worth the price. We also both ordered drinks from the bar which were also on point.We had our dinner outside and the weather was great and very relaxing. This restaurant is very much a place that you should check out. Can't believe that my husband and I haven't found this restaurant sooner!"}
{"text":"The margaritas were very good, a little more tequila would enhance it.  Service was ok, but the food was overpriced and bland. $18 for bacon guacamole that used pre cooked bacon is outrageous, plus it had little taste. Then we had the lobster tacos, again for $22 for 3 really little tacos was way overpriced and again it was bland. The lobster meat had zero taste so I suspect it was processed versus prepared on site. If they fried it it would enhance the taste  Better get off the property and go to a real Mexican restaurant at half the price"}
{"text":"Real nice mexican fine dining in the Fairmont Resort!  Scottsdale has so many excellent restaurants and this one should be considered in the top five.   The deep flavors created by their renowned chef would make chef Ramsey proud.   The service was a little slow at times but the food and drink were a solid five!  The cost is in the range of fine dining but worth every penny."}
{"text":"The food was pretty tasteless.  I had a burrito suiza that was to be served with house and cheese sauce - it had to pieces of provolone cheese melted on it.  It was alright, but the chicken had no Mexican flavor at ALL.  Other person had pork tacos, which were bombed with cilantro and the pork was pretty tough.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Fabulous experience. Bright and friendly staff, prompt service, phenomenal food!  Hubby had a combo dinner, which was amazing and seriously flavorful. I had the mariscada a la diablo and could not stop eating it! So good!! The flavors are rich and full, the textures are perfect... crisp tacos and chips, smooth sauces and fresh tortillas. The margaritas are fresh and generously sized. Five stars isn't enough for La Hacienda, I give them 10."}
{"text":"Went here last night with another couple for dinner.  The pitcher of margaritas was spot on, the chips were outstanding along with the guacamole and salsa.  I ordered the tortilla soup which I ended up sending back cuz to be honest it tasted and looked like a bowl of enchilada sauce.  My husband ordered the filet and enchilada which I have to say was cooked perfectly and definitely would order if I ever went back.  The other couple ordered the beef short ribs which I didn't taste but they both agreed it was over cooked. Service was great but when I have to send something back which I rarely do I can't give more then 3 stars."}
{"text":"Average Mexican restraint.  Nothing that would cause it to stand out. Nothing that would provide a compelling reason to check it out. Service was fine. Restaurant was clean. Food was acceptable."}
{"text":"How can one restaurant continue to be the best that Phoenix has to offer for over 25 years? Visit La Hacienda at the Princess Resort to find out! A remarkable restaurant with \"over the top\" entrees and southwestern unique presentations.   Service was a bit spotty due to volume of diners, but even that shouldn't discourage  a visit. This is my first visit to the restaurant in almost 7 years. It was always considered my favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix/Scottsdale. Shame on me for waiting so long to return. If visiting the valley, or just out for a special evening, it is a \"must\" to truly experience the very best we have to offer in Southwestern cuisine."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in last night to give this place a try. It's a very cute little place.  Clean, attractive and very well done. The beer was cold and my wife thought her margarita was just Ok.  Service was good.  The problem was the food.  It just isn't good.  It was unimaginative and kind of bland.  Summary, nice place, great location, get a new chef."}
{"text":"The food was good, my sangria was good.  The prices were cheap.  I did notice they charged me wrong for my sangria, it was $2.75 on the menu and they charged $3.75 on the bill, I wasn't too concerned about the issue though.. my bill was only $20 for two of us (definitely can't complain).    My problem was the service.  We got the chips and salsa pretty promptly(Great salsa by the way -really fresh taste), slight wait for the drinks, a little more of a wait for the food order.. the food came out pretty quickly (total plus) but after receiving our meal the waiter never returned to see how things were going or refill our water or ask if we wanted another drink.  We sat there with our food and beverages gone waiting for the check for a good chunk of time... finally he came to take my boyfriends plate and as he started to walk away we requested the check.  Over all I may return because the food was good but if you're looking for a more relaxing atmosphere this probably isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad but their customer service was wonderful. I wouldn't care if I never went back for the food, it was average."}
{"text":"Given that this restaurant was 1/4 full on one of the busiest weekends (July 4) should have been a warning sign. We made reservations for 6:45 PM and were seated next to a table of 20 people with screaming kids (I am as mad with myself for not asking for another table as I am with the airhead hostess for seating us there). Given that there were more employees at the restaurant than patrons, I don't understand why the service was so poor.   When we sat down they did the usual up-sell on bottled water (attention all restaurants -- this is getting ANNOYING) and we asked for \"tap water\" and I ordered a prickly pear frozen Margarita no salt. What arrived was a Margarita WITH salt. Given there was straw I went ahead and started drinking it, but within 60 seconds the waiter came to prepare the \"table side guacamole\" and he asked me if I liked the drink and I said it was OK but they went ahead and put salt on it. His response? \"OK\" ... note to management, when either your bartender or waitstaff screw up should they not try to make amends?   Given that I've had \"table side guacamole\" at much cheaper places, like El Torito Grill, I expected something more than bringing a bowl with all the ingredients and the waiter standing there mixing them --- no explanation of WHAT the ingredients were or if we wanted this or that in the guacamole --- so why say \"table side\" when it might as well have been done in the kitchen? And to top it off I had to ask the waiter about the two hot sauces; e.g. what were they, were they hot or mild, etc. The guacamole was OK, not the best and it was EXTREMELY salty. My guest and I couldn't figure out why.   My guest ordered the Filet with Cheese enchiladas and I ordered the \"tres tacos\". My tacos were probably an appetizer but I wasn't that hungry and quite honestly nothing on the menu looked that great. They also had an all-you-can-eat buffet for $29 but to my guest and myself it looked like a glorified taco bar (with a nasty looking roasted whole suckling pig in the middle -- I'm sorry, when I see something that could possibly be someones pet roasted whole on a platter it doesn't make my mouth water).   My three tacos were one pork which was so hot I had to take a Pepcid AC after the meal, a chicken taco that was quite good and a steak carnitas taco that was smothered in the sweetest tasting BBQ sauce I've ever had --- that one I skipped after the first bite.   In the meantime, table with all the brats (why do parents allow this?) kept getting louder, my guest's steak and enchiladas came. He ordered the steak medium rare and what came was somewhere between medium well and well done. The waiter was actually standing behind me when I saw my guest cut the steak in half and looked in shock at how well done it was. Before I could say \"send it back NOW\" the waiter said, ohh, that looks well done to me. So he took it back but offered NOTHING given that I was done with my meal by the time the next steak came which was BLOODY RARE. My guest and I had headaches from the screaming children and just wanted to get the hell out of there so he ate most of the steak but left the most bloody rare pieces for the kitchen staff to see when the plates were returned to the kitchen. We waited forever for the check and the waiter didn't take anything off the bill or even offer a free desert. I left a 10% tip and will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"I had two colleagues visiting from out of town and I wanted to give them an authentic southwest experience. La Ha didn't disappoint! The food was fabulous, courtesy of our waiters recommendations. The organic marg had the perfect balance of sweetness and tart - very refreshing on an AZ night. Both the filet and tempura fish were great recommendations. We loved them both! And of course - the flaming coffee cart finished the night. It's a must if you go so save room for a fancy coffee dessert drink. And say high to Berms - excellent server!!"}
{"text":"We went for the buffet on Monday afternoon. We had been here before and they had a much nicer spread...maybe it was for their weekend buffet.  The buffet is okay for what you pay. Its like $7.95 and there's a decent variety of grub. There were several types of enchiladas, roasted chicken, a vegetable soup and rice/beans. There are ground beef, shredded chicken, chipotle-creamy chicken and fajita chicken for tacos. There was also this semi-spicy pork that was probably the tastiest option on the buffet. They have hard tortillas and soft tortillas. Plus all the fixings for tacos/nachos/etc. There were three different salsas, a pico di gallo and tons of fresh-made guacamole.  They had these huge stuffed chile rellenos. Its a huge poblano chile stuffed with shredded beef and veggies and them coated in an egg batter and fried. Very tasty and its huge!  Other than the spicy pork, my favorites were the unlimited guacamole and the Mexican rice.   Most of the food is kind of bland and boring. It all tastes good but its uninspired and not terribly exciting. The presentation is also seriously lacking. I know its a buffet but there doesn't seem to be any attempt at trying to make the food look good.  The last time we went, they had shrimp and steak out. I believe that's just for the weekend buffet (which is $13.95 not $7.95). They also had chicken wings and pozole. I was really hoping they'd have pozole this time but no such luck.  My only real complaint was that they charged me for my daughter, who is 2 years old. They've never charged for her before. Actually, she's never been charged anywhere. It didn't have the buffet price on the menu for either adults or children. I didn't want to argue with the guy but I was a bit bummed out when I saw that I paid six bucks for three tortilla chips and some honeydew.  They have a full menu and they have their liquor license now. I would like to check out the rest of the menu some time."}
{"text":"Another great meal with my wife. Will come back again!  Please enjoy the guacamole made right at your table!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try La Hacienda for a while, and last night we FINALLY made it happen. First of all, the Scottsdale Princess is gorgeous. I wish I wasn't such a party pooper because it would have been great to hang out there and have a drink at the outdoor bar. Next time.  I started my meal with the Elderflower margarita. 1800 blanco tequila, St. Germain, and fresh sour on the rocks. It was incredibly smooth, but a teensy bit too sweet for me. Next time I'll probably stick with a more traditional option.  We ordered the guacamole sampler, which came with three different types of guac: Pomegranate, Spicy Crab, and Pepita. All were delicious, but I think the pomegranate was the table favorite (we had it prepared without walnuts due to allergies).  The chips were freshly made and so delicious I almost didn't have room for my entree.  I enjoyed the Pollo en Mole Rojo, and it was really very good. The chicken was tender, and I loved their mole sauce. I also liked the plantains that accompanied the dish (I love plantains). My husband was less-than-impressed with his Enchiladas Verdes, but I think he forgot what tomatillos taste like.  For dessert, we experienced their flaming coffees. This is an experience unto itself, and if you happen to see someone getting one, you won't be able to leave the restaurant without sampling one yourself. I can still smell the cinnamon. Yum."}
{"text":"We went to La Hacienda for dinner last night to celebrate my birthday. What a beautiful place! Nice atmosphere and pretty setting in the Fairmont Hotel. Our server was very friendly and attentive and gave us good recommendations. We tried the prickly pear margarita-sweet and delicious! Appetizers were great too-fundido, empanadas, and elote. Chips and salsa were complimentary and they were fresh and plentifuL. For our entrees, my husband had the short ribs. Good size portion and wonderful flavors. I had the lobster tacos with a side of rice. The flavors were amazing! Our children had fajitas, steak quesadillas, and chicken tacos. All of their meals were tasty and good portion sizes. Dessert was amazing-churros with 3 dipping sauces in edible cups, a homemade chocolate cookie and the most delicious Tres Leches cake ever! It had a layer of flan and coconut frosting. I'm still dreaming about it! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"J says - \"Save your money and go to SomeBurros down the street\"  L says - \"Skip this one and go to the next Mexican restaurant on your list\"   Due to its glowing reviews on Yelp, we were excited to try La Hacienda. It is located at the Fairmont Princess and with a past outstanding dining experience at Bourbon Steak, we wanted to give this a shot. Unfortunately, we arrived at the Fairmont Princess excited but left disappointed.   First Impression/Ambiance - Nice decor and very South West.  The plate settings were very nice and we liked the Desert Landscape Centerpiece.   Food  First, we were told that the Kitchen was not able to make Vegetarian Tacos. Even though, there were Tacos and a Grilled Vegetable Plate on the menu.   CHIPS AND SALSA - Complimentary and the best part of our meal. Chips tasted very fresh and flavorful. The salsa was very smooth and had many bold flavors.   VEGETABLE FAJITAS - It arrived in a tiny skillet on a plate with rice, guacamole, and a little extra salsa. Flour tortillas arrived but looked translucent. They seem to be made fresh but oily and under cooked.  HALIBUT PLATE - The Halibut plate looked delicious. L was ready to go to town but was immediately disappointed on the first bite. The vegetable quinoa was good but the halibut was over cooked and dry. Even with the chimichurri sauce, L said the plate was just ok and tasted very bland.   Service - The hostess was very friendly but we found it interesting how she initially sat us in a dark corner of the restaurant, when we were the only diners at the time.  We asked to be seated by the window with much more adequate lighting and the hostess paused as if it would be a problem. On a good note, our waters were filled to the top consistently and our plates were cleared swiftly when we were done. However, when we did ask the busser/food runner if the Tortillas normally looked like this, she replied \"I will ask the Chef\". We waited, skipped dessert, paid our dinner bill, and left without knowing.   For an expensive menu and a restaurant at the Fairmont Princess, this was overall a sad disappointment. We are surprised that so many diners have enjoyed their experiences here."}
{"text":"Only place in Chandler that has vegetarian chimichangas!!! Yaaay!! Tasty food and good service!"}
{"text":"Had a dinner meeting here last night as my business partner was staying here and it was just okay. Yes, the setting is nice, the restaurant clean but the food wasn't anything to write home about. We started with the guac and chips and the guac was spicy and good but in my experience not many restaurants can mess up guac.  I just had seafood enchiladas and while the food came out piping hot, like the plate was really, really, hot, it was really super salty. On top of it, when I peeled back the tortilla to see how much seafood was inside, I was sadly disappointed. I think I counted two pieces of seafood, maybe it was crab? or shrimp whatever the mystery lump (couldn't tell as it was dark) it was certainly not enough for the price of this dish. The food here is pricey and not sure what my business partners thought of their meals but they certainly didn't finish their plates nor mention that their food as exceptional."}
{"text":"Be sure to make reservations or be prepaired to wait.  This is a great restaurant!  The food is amazing and the service is good too.  It is pricy (expected in Scottsdale) but worth it.  YUMMY FOOD & GREAT SERVICE!"}
{"text":"This is my fourth time here.  Obviously I like it.  That being said, the service today left me wanting.   I believe they lost my reservation, the one where I asked to sit outside.  My party of three had menus on the table for almost 30 minutes.  They forgot to make our appetizers and noticed, when the bill came, they even forgot to write it down.  All that being said, the food was wonderful.  I had the chicken mole and guacamole.  Very good.  My guests had flautas and sea bass.  It looked very good, and they loved it. I would go there again.  Maybe just a bad night."}
{"text":"Carnitas hacienda - slow braised pork, chicharron, avocado salsa, and sweet corn habanero slaw for me.  Camarones Tequila with bean gordita, Rajas corn crema, salsa Chipolte, and pico de gallo for my wife.  Wash it down with two Corona light michelada style capped by a sniffer of Clase Azul Ultra.  Mexican food at its finest!!"}
{"text":"Another large group but they went over the top. Had two separate dinners here this week and the service and food was awesome both times. Highly recommend La Hacienda!"}
{"text":"The service was great. The waiter was so nice and helpful. I really wanted to like this place but none of our party of 4 liked our food. It wasn't horrible but wasn't good, everything was really sweet - the salsa and the sauces on our food, everything.   The food had Mexican food ingredients but didn't taste like any Mexican food I've ever had - and not in a good way. I can only assume all of the positive reviews are from people who don't like spicy, cheesy Mexican food but want something more on the sweet and bland side.   Definitely would not recommend."}
{"text":"We went here for a family birthday dinner since we had been here a couple of years ago and enjoyed our meal on that visit.  We had an even better time on this visit.  The menu has plenty of choices including items for those with vegetarian diets.  I highly recommend the traditional guacamole.  The seafood enchiladas are fantastic as are the lobster tacos.  For dessert, they provide a coconut flan white cake to celebrate the birthday.  I highly recommend this choice from the dessert menu.  Service was extremely quick too and the waitress was friendly and accommodating.  If you are looking to celebrate a special birthday meal with a Southwest flair, La Hacienda is a great choice."}
{"text":"Overpriced food. Great flavors on certain. We ordered guacamole sampler, it's the same guacamole with different toppings. Not very creative in my book, not worth $20. My chicken salad was delicious, chicken was marinated well and had great citrus infused flavor, the spices were well balanced. Chicken was overcooked. It was dry, if I pay $22 for a chicken salad I expect the chicken to be perfect."}
{"text":"Someone told me that this place was rated the best Mexican Resturant in Arizona. I was not disappointed. The drinks and service were top notch. The atmosphere was a real plus, be sure to ask for outside seating which provides you a table with your own fire pit. Simply over the top. The food presentation was nicely done and the homemade guacamole prepared at table side was worth the trip. We were staying at the Fairmont with friends and went here twice. Great experience a must try place to have a relaxing dinner with friends!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, the Snake Bite was a very cool drink with an amazing presentation. Service was friendly and prompt. We had a large party of 16 and the staff was on the ball!!!"}
{"text":"Nice staff. Nice interior but that's about it...ordered the pollo chipote. Good flavor but it was a mountain of Bell peppers and maybe 2 oz of chicken if I was lucky. For 16 bucks too...sorry but won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I cannot believe it. Our chips and salsa had to be sent back twice because it was too cold. Also When the entrees came ount they were also cold. This sould not happen as a resort and a restaurant that is renowned for excellence among the people in the community. We were not impressed."}
{"text":"Gouge City  This review is not particularly directed at the quality of the food or the service, but rather the cost. I've lived in the Valley for over 40 years and I've eaten a ton of Mexican food in that time but I've never paid what I recently paid at this place. Holy cow is this place expensive!! Ridiculously expensive. Chips, salsa and guacamole is $15 for what would be considered a few dollars at any other Mexican joint in town. I ordered chicken fajitas ($26) which consisted of a seasoned, grilled chicken breast sliced over a bed of sauteed onions and peppers with some rice and three little cups of accoutrements. Average and WAY overpriced. Washed it down with an $18 martini just to dull the pain before the bill came.   Obviously I don't have much of a review reputation here but I felt compelled enough to write about La Hacienda, and not in a good way. If your a guest at the resort call an Uber and tread on over to Arriba Mexican Grill in north Scottsdale. You'll get great food and still save a bunch of money in the process."}
{"text":"Overall good.  The margaritas were good and guacamole was amazing to start!  My short rib was ok, I wasn't impressed and wished I ordered something else.  My wife had the mole chicken and loved it.  The churro were really good and the flan was ok.  Overall, it was a great experience and maybe would have received a higher rating if I ordered a little differently."}
{"text":"Came here late night with a friend to order take out, almost 230am and the place was packed!   While the food wasn't bad, it definitely was not as described on the menu. My \"large flour tortilla\" quesadilla was a six-inch tortilla folded and cut in half. And the cheese wasn't even melted. A little disappointed, but it was drunk food so whatever.  Maybe I'll try it again in the day time when they aren't overwhelmed with drunk people ^_^"}
{"text":"I heard from my coworkers this place was very good & cheap.   Well, they were partially right. I mean prices are reasonably & portions are fair. As far as the food goes, it's not all that great.   Starting off with chips & salsa weren't that good. Too thin no salt and la salsa was too watered down. A coworker was very unsatisfied with his coctel de camaron. He said it tasted like they added Louisiana hot sauce.   If anything, la agua de horchata was amazing, and the service was great."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have had in Phoenix by far.  Amazing food, great service.  As a vegetarian, some of the higher-end Mexican restaurants leave something to be desired in terms of menu options. I have feel the best flavors are in the meat.  Not that case at all here.  The side veggies themselves were amazing on our fish."}
{"text":"The parrillada meat plate is excellent, a great option to share with someone and still have plenty of left overs to take home. Every time I visit Madison I am sure to come to La Hacienda...the service is always efficient...granted, no one is falling over themselves trying to massage egos here like at other places in Madison, but that is what makes this place even better. You can go, sit back, eat, take your time and enjoy yourself without being bothered. If you are high maintance and need to be fawned over, there are other options. La Hacienda does great Mexican food and a fair price in a decent setting. Why do people feel the need for more than that??"}
{"text":"The Mission it's not, but about as good as mexican food will get in Wisconsin, home of cheese curds, bratwurst and brandy."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is kid friendly, has amazing service, delicious food and a great atmosphere. The guacamole was delicious.  We took the suggestion of our waiter and ordered the the carnitas entree and the chicken enchiladas.  Both dishes were flavorable and tasted amazing.  My favorite drink was the prickly pear margarita.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"La Hacienda is a stand out establishment from the moment you step out of your car. Our hostess was friendly and we were seated at the bar area while we waited for a table. The bloody mary is an 11/10. It is spicy and flavorful. Before our dinner we had fresh guacamole made right before our eyes. It was robust and flavorful, like a fiesta in your mouth. For dinner I had the carnitas enchiladas with mole sauce, and it was a dream come true. The meat was tender and juicy, the tortilla was fantastic and the mole was a piece of art. The mole sauce was not too chocolate-y, it was spicy and had warm cinnamon flavors. For dessert we got the churros with various dipping sauces. The churros were warms and tasty, and they paired well with the different sauces. Overall, the service was friendly, and I will definitely go back the next time we go to Arizona."}
{"text":"Loved the appetizers. I'd definitely return. Ideal date spot, or for business dinners."}
{"text":"Overall disappointed in their holiday event. The salad was ok. Main meal of short ribs was good. Nothing special or unique/Mexican. . No one at any table ate the desert- dry cake w hard frosting. I am sure the kitchen and manager were ashamed of all the uneaten food.  We had a hard time getting refills on water and drinks.  Outdoor seating at fire pit was nice.  Meal was not worth the cost.  Interestingly we got a 20% discount from our server - \"just because\".  I love going here on regular nights. I hope they fix this special night. It was as if they didn't really want it to be an enjoyable New Year's Eve meal."}
{"text":"WORST MEXICAN FOOD EVER!  How is that for a title?  So, one evening last week my wife and I wanted some Mexican food and while we would normally patronize some of the other places in Madison (and yes, we do like Laredo's) my wife suggested la Hacienda on park Street since she had not been there in years.   Honestly, neither have I.  I think I had been there once before at 2:30 AM as a drunk college student.   Anything tasted good back then.  Well, we got there and sat down right away and placed our orders. I go steak fajitas and my wife got a steak burrito.   Ok....remember that!  So while we wait we got the normal chips and salsa and wow did the salsa suck.  it was a tasteless liquid....yuck and the chips were nowhere near fresh or even warm.  But next came out meals...  My wife burrito was tasteless and dry with nothing special about it at all.  The steak inside was dry, tough, and burnt and the extra cheese she orders....wait....it had not cheese at all.  She took three bites and was done  My fajitas were the same.  the steak was burnt, over cooked, hard and had zero flavor.  The veggies on the skillet were just cut tomatoes and onions.  Where are the peppers people?   NO FLAVOR AT ALL!   What terrible food!  I am not even going to try to be funny and witty with this one because the place and food just sucked and on top of that was pricy for Mexican food as well.  hell, I would have been better off going down the road to Taco Bell.   At least TB has taste!"}
{"text":"So tied on this one.  We saw awesome reviews and really wanted to find a fajitas place so we tried here since our earlier lunch was a bust.  I get nervous when I walk in and am the only table seated and served. I agree service was great!  Review food:    Chips and salsa comes with the table so thats always nice!  Salsa was sweet and more of a ragu for those who like a thicker sweeter sauce. Kids corn dogs - normal and what you would expect.   Fajitas- everything was tossed in what looked like a red sauce but it was good.  The bottom of the pan was very hot and burned most of the bottom.  But it was a lot of veggies so that was nice and we could pick off the top.  We did find a French fry in out meal as well as some onion skins.   Margaritas - kind of tasted like flavored water.    Shame because we had high hopes."}
{"text":"Second time at this restaurant, we were celebrating a birthday which I mentioned to the host. We were a bit early and we got a nice table. The birthday guy didn't get any acknowledgment at all that makes one star less. I can't be disappointed about this beautiful restaurant, they bought me with their delicious salsas, the morita salsa is my favorite. This is a tequila bar only, which draft beers aren't available a bit disappointing about it. Orlando was very helpful and attentive as well as his assistant waiter. We ordered the chorizo empanadas for appetizer and for entrees the carnitas enchiladas and carnitas plate, both delicious specially the enchiladas with the delicious mole on top. My carnitas were so good but you don't get tortillas with it. I have to asked for an order of tortillas for a charge. The corn tortillas are so good!!! Tortillas is a big part of Mexican's way of eating all those traditional dishes a dish without it isn't complete. I would suggest adding three tortillas for this dish as a part of it. This place is already very expensive and paying extra for some tortillas to eat your meal seems obnoxious. The princess can do better than that..."}
{"text":"Another good place for Mexican food out of the ordinary this place you know cater to your every need the salsa and guacamole was on point the stuff of fears will also good will go back to this place again"}
{"text":"there is no happy hour. don't be fooled by any pamphlets or Internet heresay that might indicate otherwise. just paid $40 for a few appetizers, no cocktails. if you want expensive ok Mexican food, this is your spot."}
{"text":"High priced low value service.  This was my second time here.  I proposed my party of three couples plus a single gentleman have dinner here. The handling of the bill was a one star performance.  I felt sorry for my friend who I invited to join us.  He does not drink and had a light meal.  The rest of us had cocktails and appetizers. The bill was delivered without any of our party asking.  Of course it was a combined total.  Thinking we were at the Fairmont and in a relatively highly rated restaurant I requested a split by couple plus my friend.  It is a request that would not have been necessary if the waiter had been professional enough to ask before giving us the bill.  His response was surly.  \"It will take me an hour if you have time to wait\".   I regret not asking for the manager because my polite friend ended up being grossly overcharged paying his share of the combined bill.  This restaurant is pretending to be fine dining.  The food is good.  But a sincere guest service ethic does not exist.  Beware the high prices do not represent sophisticated service.  The short shot house margarita is another example of the mind set.  I could on, but a word to the wise is sufficient."}
{"text":"The Pollo ala crema was fantastic, as were my wife's fajitas. Great service as well. We'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"It's the authentic Mexican food experience with good food, a lively staff and a very family atmosphere. Be careful about portion sizes though, I ended up ordering more than I could finish."}
{"text":"First time there for lunch and I was extremely impressed. Even though this place is a small establishment the customer service and the food portions were adequate. We got the chimichanga for lunch and it was absolutely the right amount. The food was very flavorful and to me this is more of an upscale place then a small restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered a medianoche- it came in a copper cup, did I accidentally order a spinoff Moscow Mule? Maybe, I couldn't tell. Fruity, refreshing with a hint of smoke.  Did you know Maria and her daughter come in at 4am in the morning and makes all the tortillas for the restaurant?? That bit of knowledge made the complimentary chips and salsa all the more delicious. Pork shoulder carnitas hacienda were made perfectly, meat that fell apart and juicy and flavorful. The heaviness of the pork shoulder was offset by the refreshing slaw which was simply dressed with like vinegar rather than mayo. Sad I couldn't finish it and didn't take it to go due to a late night flight though it would have been a good midnight snack!"}
{"text":"It was my absolute pleasure to be invited as a guest to a client's holiday party at La Hacienda by Richard Sandoval, which is a AAA Four-Diamond-winning restaurant located on the property of the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Resort.  Everything was just lovely including the location, the service and most of all - the food!  The building itself is built and decorated in a rustic Spanish Mission style, and they've spared no expense with the décor.  You enter through large wooden & glass doors flanked by outdoor seating areas with beautiful gas lamp & glass pebbled fire pits and many free-standing, modern brushed metal gas heaters with dramatic flames shooting up the center glass tubes.  Impressive to say the least until you pass through the doors into the foyer directly in front of  a very modern and visually compelling backlit bar stocked with an impressive collection of high-end tequilas and spirits.  La Hacienda is renowned for its tequila offerings and knowledgeable staff which can recommend any number of fine distilled spirits based on your tastes.  The foyer is bedecked with a massive wrought iron chandelier and flanked by dining areas to the left and the right.  Our party was hosted in a cozy private dining area featuring beautiful French doors and a working fireplace crackling with fragrant, seasoned wood that set the scene for a sophisticated, yet fun dinner with about 30 + people.  The servers were prompt in taking our drink orders and several people at my table got delicious prickly pear margaritas that looked (and apparently tasted - I did not sample them), phenomenal.   Once all the guests arrived we were treated to a magnificent buffet-style dinner that absolutely blew my socks off!  The buffet line itself consisted of over three tables of the best authentic Mexican foods I've ever had.  One table alone was stocked to the gills with homemade salsas tomato and tomatillo of every imaginable kind, pickled onions, vegetable escabeche, shredded Cotija cheese and REAL crema.  The buffet featured authentic quesadillas, enchilada casserole, Mexican rice, epazote-scented black beans, encrusted beef tenderloin, grilled fish, baked clams Veracruzana and my three favorite things that I've been craving for days since the party; an unparalleled mole poblano, a savory shrimp in chipotle-chili sauce exploding with plump, fresh king-sized prawns and an honest-to-God, roast suckling pig!    The mole was the best I've ever had in my life with large pieces of white meat chicken breast, grilled plantains and topped with sesame seeds.  The shrimp chipotle-chili sauce dish was outstanding; the prawns were HUGE and fresh in a light, creamy broth with fresh herbs and spices.  Much to-do was made of the presentation of, and subsequent carving and consumption of the roast suckling pig.  It was carried through the dining room, past the guests, fresh from the kitchen by two chefs proudly holding either end of the huge roasting platter upon which the tasty piggy laid.  Not for the faint of heart, vegetarians or those who prefer not to know where their food comes from - the piglet was roasted whole, about 3 feet long feet to snout, and its roasted crackling skin was sliced open to offer up its delicious, perfectly-seasoned flesh for the eating.  I sampled just about everything on buffet but seriously had no room for seconds. I saved the last ounce of stomach space for a serving for fresh, hot cinnamon churros accompanied by dishes of fresh caramel and cream.  Sheer delight!  All in all it was a wonderful evening that I'm certain was thoroughly enjoyed by all.  My only regret is that I had to say goodbye to that delicious buffet line lovingly prepared and served by La Hacienda staff. Next time I'm invited to \"La Ha\" I'm lining my purse with aluminum foil and bringing ziplock baggies to abscond with leftovers!"}
{"text":"We have had dinner here twice in the past month, absolutely excellent!!, tried the ceviche both times, best ever, also love the spinach enchiladas, shredded chicken nachos, the shrimp molcajete, and the chili relleno.  The manager Cesar is super friendly and makes sure everything runs smoothly.....we will return!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Woodfire tables,  a giant christmas tree with songs playing and lights that turn on and off, ice skating, ect. The whole place is decorated amazingly. I love it! Omg you have to come here during christmas at the princess which is from december 20th to january 3rd."}
{"text":"As always beautiful place. The margaritas were excellent, had to send my Malbec back    it was very warm.  It was great but it was a high alcohol wine and needed to be chilled a bit. Malbec should not be served at 70+ degrees.  The service is excellent, atmosphere is great Love the salsa and chips.  I was very disappointed with the shrimp entree, Three of us had it.  The shrimp were a little larger than salad size.  The rest of rice and food on the dish was very un appetizing  This is NOT David Sandoval quality at all.  I am not a complainer I have had 2 very expensive weddings at the Princess and one dinner at the La Hacienda for 200 so I have a right to say something."}
{"text":"The food is slightly above average but not by much. The first time I was here I ordered the menudo. The portion was average and the taste was good; I've had better... the second visit I ordered the pork burrito w cheese and a coffee for lunch. The portion is good but lacked flavor overall. The chips were good but lacked flavor. The salsa, and hot sauce was also plain and watered down. Overall the food was good and flavors where \"safe\". The My wife had enchaladas w rice n beans, and she finished everything. She said it was ok but not great. I give this place a four star for good service and the availabity for fries. Fries are the only thing my daughter prefers to eat."}
{"text":"We tried La Hacienda for lunch prior to the 4th of July weekend and I am now a fan. The hostess seated us immediately and then our waitress brought out the menus and a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa. The tortilla chips were fresh, hot, crunchy, and delicious. The salsa was a pico with tons of fresh flavors. It was a little too watery for my taste though. We used our chips to dredge out the chunks and were left with a lot of clear liquid afterwards. Our waitress offered to refill chips and salsa but we deferred. I ordered the lunch fajitas. This came with six tortilla shells. Usually I only get three and am always wishing for more, but this was perfect. I had both chicken and steak and while there wasn't a lot of meat, what was there was delicious. There were plenty of grilled onions, peppers, and especially tomatoes as well as small pile of lettuce and two small containers of guacamole. The beans and the rice were both excellent. The rice was fluffy and light, the beans were creamy. While waiting for our food to come we noticed many tables near us had sizzling platters of meat with flames beneath them. We learned these are the parrillada and they smell and sound amazing. When the check came, our waitress included two lollipops. I really enjoyed the experience and look forward to going back and trying the parrillada."}
{"text":"Top of the line establishment!!  Their friendly service starts from when they greet you at the door!!  The food is superb with generous portions and great flavor!!  The Guacamole is SUPERB!!"}
{"text":"Never made it. No signage. No place to park. Too much of an effort. Went to Cantina Laredo on E. Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd. instead. Very good experience there."}
{"text":"Good food, kind servers...we always have a good time here! And the churros are awesome. LOVE the spice of the house salsa!!!"}
{"text":"Skip this place. Salsa was bland, burrito was bland. Pablano pepper coating was grease soaked.   Higher reviews must have been from homies. Sangria's weren't even served with ice or fruit. Too many other places to try without ever going back."}
{"text":"Not very fresh and the meat in my entree looked and tasted processed. Also, a lot of bones in the meat that almost broke my teeth!"}
{"text":"I came here a second time and ordered the flan and horchata and man was I disappointed!!! The flan is so small I thought it was toddlers portion. To make it worse it tastes like plastic and serves it with lemon. Wtf is that?? The horchata is not what u would expect. It tastes like u just bit into a coconut.  It's terrible.  Save yourself the time and anguish and stay away!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today, didn't expect a sit down restaurant. Place was small but nice. Host greeted me, was extremely friendly. Warm chips and salsa were served when I was given my menu. I had limited time for lunch, I ordered the lunch special. Service was quick. The food was excellent, authentic! I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Just Amazing. This place is not only authentic Mexican cuisine it is also very unique. They had things on their menu that are very hard to find here. For instance the cochinita pibil ! You can only find this ( made the right way) in south Mexico!!! So glad I found this place! Totally recomend it! I am very picky when it comes to Mexican food ( since I always think I make it better ), however the food here taste like the one my mom makes!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place at 4am. Yep after bar. The food is what you think of beans, rice, lettuce, cheese and mystery meat, mix it different ways and call it what you will. It is rot gut Mexican but it is awesome late at night. After spending a lot of time in the SW and in parts of Mexico and South America there is nowhere in Madison that get Latino or TexMex cooking right."}
{"text":"I frequently go to La Hacienda after a night out because they are open very late.  I usually order tacos de carne asada and those can be closely compared to the tacos you can find in Mexican restaurants in Chicago. On my last visit I ordered Caldo de Camaron and it had a good amount of shrimp and veggies. It was missing that spicy kick that I usually taste in most shrimp soups. Service was great for me (not sure if it's because I am a girl and all the waiters are men) but I did have a few male friends complain about the service. I am a regular at this place and I still have many more things left to try!"}
{"text":"Like wow! This place has it all: food, service, ambiance, drinks. Everything we ordered was perfect. We would not change a thing. Mike even thought the tacos had the right amount of spice!  If you are in the area you absolutely have to eat here."}
{"text":"- Terrible service - below average to average quality food - large variety of options  Use this as a late night last minute resort only."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. They even have my favorite dish, cochita pibil!!! Yum."}
{"text":"Make reservations in order to cut down on wait time in December. We made the mistake of not having them a waited over an hour and a half for a table and never received a text so we  ended up eating in the bar.   We ordered the guacamole and chips  for our appetizer which I must say was delicious. We ordered the mixed fajitas  which came with chicken, steak and shrimp which as also very tasty. The tortillas are made from scratch on the premises. The meal itself was quite delightful. For desert we ordered trace  leche coconut cake which to me was just ok and the churros which we both enjoyed.  I would defiantly go back here and the property is exquisite this time of year with all of the lights and lots of family activities as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to dinner tonight to celebrate 27 years of marriage had the filet a la Parilla at La Hacienda at the Fairmont Princess Resort and now I know what they mean on the cooking shows when they say something has been cooked to perfection! The dish was excellent! In addition our server and the other staff were all wonderful. Our thanks go out for a dining experience that could not be improved upon."}
{"text":"I've given two stars but really should be zero stars. Due to the amazing ambiance, the two stars go to the amazing setting outside with the holiday lights and fire pit table. Very nice touch!   My terrible review goes to our service! Our dinner lasted 3 hours, not by choice! Everything took a long time. Our waiter showed no sense of urgency and it was obvious that we were on HIS time. He exuded a sense of superiority with constant correction of our choice in drinks and food.   I was under the impression that waiters rely on tips and tips are based on service. Our waiter just didn't care to impress and unfortunately this reflects negatively on the resort itself. Ten people walked out of there with with no intent to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Delightful small authentic Mexican food restaurant.  Beautiful decor. Fast friendly service. Great chips n salsa very important to me. Had a taco it was good. Try it -you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We noticed this place had the molcajete which we had in Colorado so we wanted to try it here.  I shared it with someone and it was so good!!  Great flavor, not spicy.  Served with rice and beans and tortillas.  Also tried the white sangria - yep and yep!!  Coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"The \"tequilla princess\" was extremely knowledgable and guided us through the 250 types of tequilla available. Everyone enjoyed their \"flights\".  The food and the service was excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"La Hacienda! A very interesting Mexican restaurant. Well let's start off with the service. Our waiter's name was Monte. Monte does come off a little on the scary side when you first meet him. I will admit it. After the appetizers hit the table Monte turned into a really funny, caring guy. Anyway, to the food... We started with chips, salsa, and guacamole. Very very good. The meal I recommend ordering would be the Mexico City fajitas. They will blow your mind! On the other hand my buddy Paul ordered the Carnitas Enchiladas. Be very careful with the sauce they use with all the Enchilada dishes. If you are American and under the age of 30, I promise you won't like it. Drinks were out of this world. I had a sprite with a lime and it was very tasty. 4/5 Stars."}
{"text":"First: Food - The food here is some of the best Mexican food around. I particularly enjoy the shrimp molcajete. For all you seafood lovers, there's a good variety of Mexican with seafood like the crab filled half pineapple! My kids like the steak quesadillas. The kids meals are decent sized portions. I like their refried beans. Chips and salsa a plenty at dinner. Ask for their habanero salsa for a kick! For dessert, have the flan. It's dulce delicious!  Second: Drinks - Best jalapeño margarita and no fake sugar mix! They use limes, oranges and tequila. They have beer, wine and liquor as well as coke products.  Third: People - The staff is amazing. Friendly, helpful and truly care about their customers.  Fourth: Place - Small, but cozy and great decor. They have a small patio if you want to sit outside but my boys would rather sit inside and watch sports on their TVs  Fifth: Catering - They catered my bday party and did a great job. We ordered fajitas. They were hot, ready, and well packaged when we picked it up. The food was a hit. No leftovers for us!"}
{"text":"I just love this please. The molcajete is delicious. Servers are not super professional/formal but really friendly and easy going. Been here multiple times now and definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I love this place... the atmosphere is kinda trashy but what do you expect from a place that is open until 4 am and frequented by the drinkers of madison?! The food is good... You get a ton of it at a great price... they have Mexican beer and a bunch of different types of margaritas, which are pretty good :) The servers there are also super friendly, which says a lot since I am sure that they have to deal with a lot of trash. If you are in the area and have a hankering for some Mexican, it is worth the stop"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a drive by and was glad we did, the place was  a nice surprise, from the moment we walked in Caesar  greeted us and not only took our order he gave us some great recommendations. The food came out hot and amazing the beer was cold and the chips and salsa kept coming . We will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Blechh.    Clearly it's not just me - the owners need to spend some time traveling to Milwaukee and eating at a place like Riviera Maya, or even El Rey.  This is just crappy food.  How do you screw up pinto beans or pico de gallo?  I've never eaten Mexican food with so little flavor.  I asked for hot sauce, they brought me red sauce with pepper seeds in it, and it had NO flavor, and NO heat.  What??  And to make this more memorable you can buy the flavorless sauce to go.  I actually had to salt my food, which I never, ever do in a restaurant.  And the rice tasted like it was made with old onion that had been pre-chopped and stored in the frig - you know that taste?  It tastes like your old college roommate's shoes smelled.    I make far better Mexican from scratch.  Heck, Ortega makes better.    Drive 5 more blocks and go to La Guadalajara, WAY better."}
{"text":"When I heard there was an upscale Mexican restaurant at the Fairmont Princess resort, I got extremely excited. Bf & I love Mexican but pretty much have to settle for the mediocre Americanized stuff back in Ohio. The bride-to-be highly recommended La Hacienda, so we all stumbled over after a day of boozing & bronzing.   We sat in the bar area, as it was happy hour, and treated ourselves to $6 half-price Margaritas. They were pretty darn tasty, especially after a hot day by the pool. I had wanted to move to a nicer table for our meal and was told nothing was available for nearly 4 hours - so make a reservation if you want to guarantee yourself a spot!   We ended up eating in the bar area, which was great because our server (a nice blonde girl I can't remember the name of) was super awesome. Happy hour was only 5-6 and at 5:55 she reminded us and asked if we'd like another - despite the fact we had full glasses. Cha-ching. I was getting kind of full on drinks but gung-ho about the food so I didn't sway on our order of Queso Fundido ($14), Chicken & Shrimp Fajitas ($29) and Short Rib enchiladas ($23).   The queso came out first and was tasty but not at all what we were expecting. Instead of being a dip, it was really more like stringy cheese that had to be forked onto a tortilla. Again, really great flavor but we ended up feeling like we ate cheese burritos when we were done. The smoky salsa that accompanied the queso was superb. One of the best salsas I've ever had. The flour tortillas were freshly made and a nice change from what I'm used to back home. Some other people at our table got the guacamole ($14-enough for 4!) and I was majorly jealous.  Our meals came out (we were sharing both) and we managed to taste some of each before we had to box them up (damn queso!). We both preferred the fajitas over the enchiladas, but we aren't crazy about corn tortillas in general so that could have swayed us. The short rib in the enchiladas was amazing though. Both meals came with rice and mashed (refried?) black beans, which we were just kind of \"meh\" about. Needless to say, both meals were still great cold the next day.   Being on a resort, it was AWESOME that we could take our last margarita to go in a plastic cup. God, I love vacation."}
{"text":"So disappointed ! We read the reviews and headed over, thinking about Lobster Tacos.  Parking was a nightmare, poor signage for those of us from out of town. Strolled the grounds looking for the entrance to the resturant, beautiful grounds with all the Christmas lights maned carousel.  The aromas in the air as we entered we so inviting.   The hostesses were very friendly, but seem surprised we'd be there to dine when we weren't staying there.  Sat us right away, in the corner by the kitchen. The hostess was the only staff we ever spoke with.  Water was poured then we sat and sat and sat and sat.  After 10 minutes (maybe a little more) we hadn't received a \"Hello\" \"I will be right with you\" or any kind of greeting so we left.   Perhaps if we'd been a guest at the Fairmont we would have had better service and we would of had the opportunity to experience the Lobster Tacos others raved were so good."}
{"text":"This place's ambience is comparable to a Godfather's Pizza. Really open dining area, lots of lights on, green cushioned chairs, pretty quiet. Definitely a casual family restaurant. My friend and I sippin' margs felt a little out of place. I was definitely overdressed.   HOWEVER, the food was pretty good and super cheap. Maybe a lunch sort of place? I don't think I'll be coming back. Too many other places to try."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican Dive. You can get breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night!! Don't expect too much, this is as good as CHEAP authentic Mexican food gets. The service Has been consistently good over the years. Best horchata in town."}
{"text":"Was greeted and seated right away. They brought out chips and salsa immediately and took my drink order. The chips and salsa were the bomb!!! They were so good!!! They kept my basket filled with warm chips and my bowl filled with great tasting salsa. I ordered the deluxe chicken burrito....it was just ok...Im not a big fan of shredded chicken, and I like my burritos stuffed with goodies...all the toppings were just that, sat on top...swimming in some kind of red sauce. I will attach a picture. Like I said, it was good, but nothing to right home about. Probably some of the best customer service I have ever received. Kept my chips, salsa and drinks filled, service with a smile, always attended to my needs. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service and unbelievably good food!  We had the Filet and the carnitas per the Waiters recommendation; fantastic choices. Very tasty!!  We also had The Tequila taster... very good!!  We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner at La Hacienda. Our waitress was so sweet and very attentive. The food was great! I had the combo with tamales and enchilada; which I was told the tamales were hand made by the two owners with their secret recipe. The dining area was small but very warm and welcoming. My hubby had their margarita which was very good, they make their own juice (I wish all restaurants did!)"}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant twice now. Great experience both times. Sweet and spicy salsa and crisp chips, attentive service, tender beef and pork, colorful decorations. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"La Hacienda was absolutely amazing!! I had two enchiladas and a taco! It was soooo good! 11/10"}
{"text":"Stopped in late on a Sunday afternoon; it wasn't too busy in fact there were only two maybe three other parties there. The food was okay, but certainly nothing to get excited about. I thought it was a little pricey for what we got; lunch for four that included one cocktail was slightly over $100 with tip. I won't bother going back."}
{"text":"This is by far the WORST resturant I have ever been to. First they gave us a hard time, because we had a large party. Then a member from the group acted like they were sleeping (as a joke) because our appetizers were taking so long. So they ended up kicking us out, because we got loud by laughing and having a good time. We asked if we could split our bills up, and the manager said no. He told also told us that he should have kicked us out when someone was acting like they were asleep. He then watched our every move as if we were peasants and weren't going to pay our tab. We then leave and I walk back in to use the restroom, and overhere the manager talking about how he wanted to fight someone. So unprofessional. The worst experience of my life. I was a sever for 8 years, and we would NEVER be caught dead treating our guests like that. This place is disgusting and a waste of money."}
{"text":"Great quaint place, decorated nicely. Food was great. They make good strong margaritas!!"}
{"text":"Lots of good authentic Mexican here. Good for gluten-free people because the chips are made of corn and there are good options that don't involve flour tortillas.   Our server was knowledgeable and responsive.  Our group had great meals and the margaritas were great. If you're in the mood for Mexican, this is a place to check out."}
{"text":"Easily among the best Mexican food I've had, and that's including when I've lived in New Mexico and in California. I always get the enchiladas de pollo con mol and a lime margarita on the rocks with salt, but your tastes may differ."}
{"text":"On several occasions I have come, in all of them I have eaten delicious, and service is excellent."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Scottsdale!  The atmosphere is amazing...beautifully decorated, rustic and relaxing all at the same time.  The service was impeccable...they were attentive, but not bothersome.  The margaritas were delicious...I love a prickly pear margarita like nobody's business and this one definitely delivered.  The enchiladas were flavorful and just right.  All in all, a great meal with great service in a great location!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food that I have found since living here. The service is always outstanding when Cesar is there and the food is always consistent. This is now a weekly stop for the family."}
{"text":"Any place where avocado is a 'meat' choice is going to be a place I enjoy.    The service here has been consistently good, the building itself leaves some ambiance to be desired, but the food is really wonderful.  Ask for their hot sauce with your meal, it's tasty and spicy.  I highly recommend the avocado tostados!"}
{"text":"Great place in Madison right off Park. The food is cheap and the service is fast. I've never had any problems with it. It's also a great 3am treat for all you bar crawlers and night owls. Did I mention its CHEAP? Like I've ate their for less than $6 ordering ala carte with my friends and the quality/size of the meals were nothing to scoff at. Amazing! Outdoor seating even makes it more fantastic."}
{"text":"The Princess is beautiful at Christmas time.  We go to La Hacienda two or three times a year, mostly during the holidays because the atmosphere out on the patio is amazing.  The menu is quite expensive and because of this, I expect the food and service to be top notch.  My last few visits, however could have been better. I've had the chicken enchiladas with gristle laden chicken and even had a small bone in one bite. Another time I had the chicken fajita plate and couldn't even eat most of the chicken. The texture was just gross. So this last time, I went with steak. It was very good. But my other issue is the service. I think it's always been the same waiter over the last year or two. He's very short with you when you ask a question.  We asked for another cup of salsa and he seemed annoyed by this, but it's not like I'm going to stick my arm into the fire pit in our table to get some salsa. Of course he never came back. I had to get up and find someone to ask.  Not cool when we spend between $200. and $500. on our visits there.  Then a different waiter brought our food which is fine, but no one ever came back to see how everything was and we didn't see our original waiter until we finished our dinner.  The food is good though and I'll keep going back. I just expect better service."}
{"text":"Festive restaurant for celebrations.  Wonderful steaks with a Spanish flair.  Dark wood Mexican tables set the tone for a fun Spanish dinner.  Located in the beautiful Princess Hotel.  Be sure to try the sangria."}
{"text":"The food was good, ordered a chicken taco, got shredded beef. Margarita was good. When we paid server he asked if we needed change. I replied yes. 10 minutes later, no server no change. We were the only 2 in the restaurant at that time. Went to find him, said we were still waiting on him to bring us our change. He came to table and laid down some money, not the right amount. Shorted us on change. I included the shortage in his tip. Won't be going back. I felt he intentionally didn't bring the change or give us back the correct change."}
{"text":"Something happened to this place. I have been here several times. The food not so fresh not as good as it has been. Bummer. Hope they do something."}
{"text":"wonderful food and service a great place to bring my Mom with her canes as there is a good amount of space for her to walk and staff is no nice and respectful to everyone. The  margarita I had was crazy good ."}
{"text":"I enjoyed another amazing dinner on Saturday may 2. I enjoyed steak quesadillas and chips and guacamole for appetizers and then I tried pork enchiladas and I would definitely recommend them!!  Tres leches cake is a must. Beautiful surroundings and fabulous food!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent  , great special occasion restaurants .. southwest flair not the typical Mexican food . Excellent choices of Tequila  - and cocktails.."}
{"text":"Really wanted to try this place. Being that it's Friday I expect it to be busy so we understand. I had really high hopes to find another gem restaurant! Upon arriving we waited 5 mins before we were seated. The place was not full there was about 4 tables with customers and lots of empty ones. The lady finally came over and seated us after waiting for a while. She did bring us our menus and some chips and salsa. After pondering the menu we waited for our drink orders and order to be put in. The servers kept walking past us. We managed to stay patient because we really wanted to try the food. After closing my menu and trying to keep ourselves occupied my husband realized that it's been well over 15 mins sitting there while no one came over and took our order or our drink order. It wasn't before we decided to let this place go, the male server comes up and ask if we needed anything. We explained we been sitting there for at least 15 mins (longer) waiting for our order and drink order to be taken. He did apologize and advised he can give us 15% off our dinner if we stay. We had already wasted time on our date and was pushed back on schedule we advised no thank you.   I really wish things could have been different but this is our experience."}
{"text":"While staying at the resort, we tried LA Hacienda off a whim because it's so close to our room. I'm so happy we did because it is so good. First off, it's beautiful inside. Dark and romantic.  The chips and salsa are to die for! I wish they bottled their salsa. We shared shrimp fajitas with family sizes rice and beans. So yummy. Large shrimp cooked to perfection. The tortillas they have must be made in house.  They were delicious.  Then for dessert we shared the churros. YUM!!! they come with 3 dipping sauces in edible ramekins. So good and a great touch.  The chef should be proud. We will be back most definitely."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Had house margaritas during happy hour and it was unremarkable. I ordered taco trio and it tasted ok but the portion was very small. Tacos were mini sized. Looked pretty though. Guac was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"You guys. If you don't like this place, you're doing it wrong. Get the parrilladas chilanga. They will bring out a little grill and on top will be a mountain of delicious meat, cheese, and spicy sauce (spice level can be adjusted according to taste). It is AMAZING. If you like it spicy, they can actually make it spicy (not Midwestern spicy, but the real deal). I've never gotten anything else here, because I fell in love at first taste.  My friend had been trying to tell me about this place for months! I never knew what he was talking about, since he kept referring to \"large plates of meat.\" What does that mean?! But now, I'm a believer.  In a town with not too many late night options, this place is open into the wee hours of the morning! Definitely a great place to grab some grub after a night out.  Service can be a bit slow, especially since they are often slammed -- especially as the night wears on. The place can also accommodate large groups.  Oh and finally, get yourself a pitcher of the horchata. Delish."}
{"text":"La Hacienda is perfect for a quick, reasonably-priced, authentic meal. Don't expect a glamorous interior; it has the feel of a cafeteria. However, the fast service and delicious food make up for the atmosphere! The complimentary chips and salsa are good. Our server was friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, creative menu, fresh, and beautiful.  Friendly, professional waitstaff.  Beautifully refined southwest decor.  The LV Bistro was closed, so we were redirected to La Hacienda on the Fairmont Princess property.  We enjoyed a wonderful breakfast of egg white frittata and a chorizo breakfast burrito, which sound simple, but were taken to great heights.  The frittata was served atop heirloom tomato slices with fresh broccolini, mozzarella and frisee. The burrito encased eggs, cheese, potato, cilantro hollandaise beautifully plated."}
{"text":"Pricey. The food hit or miss. Table side guacamole delicious. Really enjoyed the shrimp and chicken tacos. But the plantains were dry. The decor of restaurant was superb but the service was ok."}
{"text":"The place is really nice, obviously, because it's at the Fairmont. We used to live at the Princess condos across the street and wanted to visit the area again. First, it's valet parking only, so bring cash. Second, make a reservation. We didn't and had to fend for ourselves for a spot at the bar and then a table. Quite a few people were doing this so it wasn't very relaxing, more like a game of who can find a place to sit fastest. Once we sat down, our waiter was nice and made us feel welcome. He seemed a little overwhelmed, but we enjoyed him. He gave us a free drink that he forgot to bring. The food was decent Mexican food. It is obviously overpriced because, again, you are at the Fairmont. Overall, it was a good experience. I would come back again with a reservation."}
{"text":"Probably the saddest chile relleno I've ever seen. It was a limp, greasy pepper stuffed with way too much mediocre cheese that had absolutely no flavor. The lengua tacos came out on dry tortillas, and again, lacked in flavor. Overall an overwhelmingly subpar experience - Madison has plenty of other much better restaurants to get your Mexican cuisine fix."}
{"text":"Our Steak Quesadilla appetizer came with 2 and we are a party of three. So, playfully my colleague teased our server about one of us being left out. She, Lauren, was quick with her responses and offered to make it right by bringing us a third piece. She rocked it!"}
{"text":"I recently stayed at the Fairmont Princess and decided to check out La Hacienda. What a terrific surprise and where do I start? Do I start with the great tequila choices? Cocktails? The staff was really friendly and although I read mixed reviews about the service, we had great service both times were there! So, over the course of a couple of different meals, we tried quite a few items from the menu - most notable for me were the ahi ceviche (pumpkin seeds in there! Very unique and oh so good), the trio de tacos is a must and the pipian de puerc (slow cooked pork) is out of this world good! For dessert, I had churros and one night, I tried the cafe 1921. They make the drink for you tableside. Part of it is streaming sugar and cinnamon from above into the glass and watching it as it catches on fire. It's quite the show.  It was also really good! I'll definitely be going back next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Hi- went here with a large group and had a-ok time. My brother had his rehearsal dinner here which was an amazing experience. This time we were here for a birthday. It was a bit odd at the end of the night when we tried to pay. The server ran all of our cards, then asked to run again, then we all ended up with multiple charges on our bills. The management was good about getting it resolved, but it had delayed our leaving by probably at least 20 mins and then we had the hassle the following days. I will go back to give another shot."}
{"text":"3.75 stars rounded up   We were staying at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess & thought we'd stay on property for dinner one night.   Walking in without a reservation was not a problem. Service is leisurely, so as long as you have time for a relaxed pace, you'll have an enjoyable meal.   We ordered:  -- michelada: 3 stars, would have liked a little more lime flavor to compliment the beer flavor  -- guacamole: delicious, & at $15, probably the most pricey guac I'll ever have! Next time we'll try the sampler. Chips were warm fresh out the fryer.  -- sweet corn tamale: would not order again; too dense, boring after a couple bites even topped with poblano cream -- taco trio: I ate the chicken tinga one which was so tasty. Hard to go wrong with shredded white meat chicken & amazing spices  -- grilled halibut for him  Decor is fun, colorful, but sophisticated. Would definitely return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Bomb!!!!!!!  Halibut amazing Shrimp and lobster enchiladas amazing Guacamole and chips and salsa amazing Service amazing Drinks can you guess?!!!! Fantastic  Pork shoulder   This place is so good, I feel like when I eat here I have transported to a far off land where the food and vibes are great and then I go home, or to my room! Boom shakalaka"}
{"text":"Ehh, the tortilla chips were too thick and hard for me, my jaw hurt and I got a headache from eating them :(  Tableside guac was so amateur! They had all the ingredients already in the bowl and the dude just mixed it up.  Didn't even ask me if I wanted it chunky or anything.   I ordered the most expensive thing on the menu -- a filet steak with two cheese enchiladas.  Now, the sauce was pretty good; it was chile gastrique.  Not sure what that means, but it was sweet and went well with the steak.  I really liked the cheese enchiladas, too.  The menu is proud to stick a little * next to the filet, saying you can get it cooked to order any way you like, but they go ahead and ignore your request, lol.  I wanted medium rare and they gave me well done.  I got a second one but eh, wasn't in the mood for it anymore.  Go to Bourbon Steak at this hotel if you're here instead :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a margarita, salsa and guac. Margarita: had the pineapple chilli marg. it was ok but expensive.  Chips & salsa: mediocre at best. Kinda bland for us.  Guac: blah blah blah This place is really sleepy, and we were here on a Saturday afternoon. We were really disappointed. It was really expensive and everything lacked flavor. We had to add salt and pepper to everything but it was still blah. We didn't have any food because we were so disappointed with everything else. The resort was beautiful so it was nice to check out.  We went to The Mission for lunch and there is no comparison. The Mission is soo good."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years. I remember great food. I was wrong. The chiles rellenos were insanely greasy. Beans and rice have no flavor. My friend's dish was unmentionable and the flan was inedible.   The service was great though!"}
{"text":"Came here before Richard Sandoval took over and it was great food. Came here again last weekend while staying at the Princess resort and while I enjoyed it, it wasn't up to its previous standards.  The good: , the salad with goat cheese and almonds, ceviche, guacamole, grilled tuna, and shrimp entree. Also, GREAT margaritas.  The bad: tamal had great flavors but was dry like sand which is unaccpetable at these prices, taco trio was nothing special, quesadillas were different but again, nothing special.  I think Richard, who now has over 30 restaurants, probably needs to pay closer attention to the food at his restaurants to keep the quality up. That said, those dishes that were good were very tasty and this was a nice, convenient spot to go for dinner while at the Princess. I'd give it 3.5 if I could."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  We sat out by the fire tables which was great.  The guacamole sampler was an excellent way to start the meal. Really great flavor on all three choices.  I also really liked their housemade chips.  For dinner my wife had their shrimp dish with chipotle, and I had the slow braised pork shoulder.  Both were excellent.  In my opinion, this is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the North Scottsdale area.  The food looks and tastes really good.  Sure the meal may cost you $10 - $20 more than your regular Mexican place, but this isn't regular chipotle or Macayo style mexican.  There are a lot of lively and authentic flavors and everything has a real freshness and vibrance to it.  Well worth it IMO."}
{"text":"Sadly, I was disappointed in this place because I had heard such good things about it. Maybe my hopes were too high but all I know is, I won't be going back. First thing and such a minor thing, the booths SUCK. You can feel the movement of the person behind you. And they're so bouncy you almost feel like your on a bouncy ball. Second thing, odd, BUT my kids ordered chocolate milk and they put so little chocolate that it may as well been plain white milk. When we got our order my boyfriends cheese enchilada was magically a chicken enchilada. He's worked in the industry so he let it slide. I got the chorizo and huevos combination and it was not good. They chorizo was vinegary and the cheese that was on the beans tasted so old it made the the entire table smell bad. The chips were stale and the tortillas I'm pretty sure are the mission tortillas you get at the grocery store.  I'm from Texas and am pretty picky about my Mexican food but I can honestly say, this was just plain bad. Wait staff was nice, attentive and the establishment itself is pleasant."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan. A bit pricey for Mexican food, but really good Mexican food! We had the guacamole sampler, my favorite being the pomegranate. I wasn't much of a fan of the bacon one--it was simply guac sprinkled with some bacon bits on top. I had the enchiladas verdes for my entrée while my husband had the filet a la parilla. We both scarfed our plates down! The enchiladas were loaded with shredded chicken and topped with a great tomatillo sauce, which I enjoyed thoroughly. My husband's filet was cooked perfectly, and his cheese enchiladas (his favorite) were gone before I could even look at them! We enjoyed the cinnamon churros for dessert, and let me tell you, these things are the softest, yummiest ones I have ever had! The accompanying sauces came in edible chocolate cups, and were absolutely delish! You're paying for a higher class atmosphere. You're paying for Scottsdale. You're paying for the complimentary valet. It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Great service and great food.  You need to try the flaming coffee a fun show and great drink."}
{"text":"This is a nice place die to location, ambiance and surroundings. However, it is too pricey for what you get compared to other Mex restaurants. The guac was good, margaritas good, dessert good, but meals are just ok. You are paying for the place, which again nice. But there are other less expensive restaurants with Great food."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Unfortunately the service was very lackluster and did not live up to the price point of the heel or the quality of the food. I did see, I wish we had had that experience. I probably wouldn't come back, but if you can get a good waiter."}
{"text":"One of the most insulting things you can say about a restaurant is that it's overrated.  This was my fear about La Hacienda before I visited.  Luckily, that couldn't be farther from the truth.  I left feeling deeply content and totally stuffed!  The dining room is beautiful and cozy.  I loved every detail, from the thick blown glass cups to the crackling fire in the fireplace.  The carved wooden backs of the chairs were pretty to admire but not the most comfortable.  Our waiter was extremely professional: friendly and attentive without hovering over us.   The menu here changes seasonally, but one thing that's a sure constant is the tableside guacamole ($15).  I make guacamole a lot at home, but somehow this was the creamiest guac I've ever tasted.  The chips and salsa were also great; it was hard not to fill up on them.  We also had Maine lobster tacos for an appetizer.  I was initially skeptical, but the salsa, avocado, and little smear of beans were just mild enough to let the flavor of the lobster really shine through.  I would recommend them for something different if you like seafood.  There are 3 to an order.  Our waiter urged that some dishes, like the fried whole fish and the carnitas, should be accompanied by a side of tortillas so that you can make your own tacos.  I wish they would include the tortillas with the dishes instead of charging you $3 extra!  For an entree I had the camarones al tequila ($29).  The shrimp were plump and juicy, although it would've been nice to have a little char on them, like there was on the fajita shrimp.  They came with what I can only describe as Mexican risotto: rajas (poblano strips), onions, cream, cheese, and rice mixed together for an addictively rich combination.  The dish also included a pinto bean gordita.  Plenty of food for one person!  (There's a $5 charge to split.)  I also tasted the chorizo con papas.  This side dish was super smoky, cheesy, and delicious, although it was really heavy and a huge portion, so beware of that.  I was way too full for dessert, but the crepes looked amazing.   It's worth coming here just for the view of the beautiful Fairmont.  If you're coming with someone with mobility issues, you can request a golf cart at the lobby, since it's a bit of a walk to the restaurant.  If not, enjoy the stroll through the well-manicured grounds of the hotel.  A lot of people have mentioned that $25-35 is a hefty price tag for Mexican entrees.  While my cheapskate side would tend to agree, I'm so pleased at how well Mexican food makes the leap to upscale here.  While I wouldn't come here every time I have a burrito craving, La Hacienda is the perfect place to come for a special occasion."}
{"text":"It pains me to down grade them a few stars but this last experience was disappointing.  I do note we did stop in for happy hour this time and really enjoyed the $5.00 margaritas and $5.00 mini tacos but I don't judge places by their happy hours because Happy Hours are usually happy anyway.  We had a really great dinner here last year and thought we would again. It's a BEAUTIFUL ATMOSPHERE here and they have beautiful Christmas Tree and Ice skating at the Princess.   For Dinner I was going to try the Grouper or the Pistachio Crusted Tuna this time but to my surprise they took them off the menu and replaced them with a Tempura Battered Fish. (website needs an update)  Why would I order Tempura at a Mexican Place? So I went with the Skirt Steak.   OK I didn't like anything on my plate. The steak wasn't tasty. It looked OK but just didn't taste good. I guess it needed some salt and pepper. I should have asked for salt and pepper. It was just soggy beef and also was like chewing just cow and not a tasty steak. I didn't like the potato gratin because it also needed salt and potatoes don't taste good unless they are salted. I didn't like the enchilada because of the horrible thick mole sauce. This was the worst mole sauce I've ever tasted in my life and if it was my first time with mole sauce I'd never touch it again. The sauce wasn't balanced and was thick and too much chocolate and it turned my stomach. I do note the table salsa was seasoned nice and the bar foods we tried were made nice so I know you can get good food here.  My husband ordered the short rib that I had last time. The rib this time was OK but not great like the one I had last time. This time it didn't have the really tasty crust on it and the portion size was much smaller. The rib was just passable and not made with the really great care like last time. But my husband felt really bad when he tasted my plate and told me I could have his instead since it was better.  A very nice manager did check on us and offered to get me something to fix my meal and it was before I knew what was wrong with what I was tasting. I told her it was just OK.  Last time they weren't busy and the food was very good. This time they were very busy and that might or might not be  factor in this last experience. I received my meal for free since I have a preferred diners card."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery today from grub hub. Food is awful! Cold and soggy. Very disappointed. Will not order again. The tacos were so soggy that you can't even hold them, they just fall to pieces when you try to pick up. Just awful!"}
{"text":"Thought the meal was great, service was very good.  Disappointing experience with the hostess who was very rude put a bit of a damper on the night for us"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food restaurant I have been to!! We have suffered through so many mediocre Mexican food restaurants! I am so happy we tried this one!! The food was ahhhmaaazing"}
{"text":"This is a very good Resturant. The decor is pleasant. It's very clean. And the service is excellent. We started with the guacamole which was made fresh when we ordered it. My husband had the special which was 3 enchiladas. One beef, one chicken and one pork which was very delicious. My carne asada fajitas was also very delicious and it was served piping hot."}
{"text":"Very meh. I was young when I gave it 3 stars.  Much better Mexican food right down the road."}
{"text":"Monday night meal was fantastic, with beautiful Casamigos tequila recommended and enjoyed. Lobster tacos: A+. Guacamole: A+. Skirt steak, Chile Relleno and Carnitas: A+. Great, enthusiastic, efficient and knowledgeable service."}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp and we were very pleased. Very clean and the waitress. Was wonderful!  We were very happy with the entire experience. It's a smaller establishment, but  large enough for groups of people. Great place!!"}
{"text":"A nice option for hotel guests, but there are better Mexican hot spots in Scottsdale with more refined food preparation. Still, La Hacienda gives you several reasons to venture here even if you're not staying at the Fairmont.   The table side guacamole is a highlight and the portion is really handsome, great for table sharing. They do fajitas really well and while my fish entree (Pacific Halibut) had a nice flavor profile, it was a little uninspired and was cooked just a hair too much.   What was unique and lots of fun was chatting with their \"tequillier\" (a new age term I learned denoting a \"tequila expert\"). They have an expansive selection so if the agave spirit is your thing, you'll really like it here.   Dessert was super yummy. We munched on their cinnamon dusted churros with Mexican chocolate and devoured their salted caramel and banana ice creams.   Season appropriate, I recommend asking for an outside table with heat lamps and fire pits. A lovely way to dine outside and keep toasty at the same time."}
{"text":"A little pricy but the food is excellent! They also have a great selection  Of tequila !"}
{"text":"1 st week of Nov. 2017 I enjoyed my dinner in La Hacienda. I had salad and fish tacos.  I loved it. Especially salad was sooo good. I love salads but this one was one of a kind. It had some fruits in it and some amazing cheez cream around it. Picture does not give it a justice. Tacos were also quite tasty. I cannot wait to bring my family there. Probably around Thanksgiving time we will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent! Beyond good! I've been craving a molcajete from Changos in Rocky point and this satisfied my craving. Be sure to ask for extra cheese when you order this dish. Hot, tasty, full of flavor. This was a nice find. Cute, clean and quaint. Attentive service. House margarita was not the best, obvi a store bought mix. The interior is on the small side so on busy nights/lunch come early. Flan was not the best, so don't bother... however fired ice cream, that was good. We plan on returning!"}
{"text":"Honestly, best meal I've had in Phoenix area, hands down, no contest. Highly recommend this place. The price point is higher than what I typically eat, but worth it. Phenomenal flavors, and top notch customer service. It's now a staple when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Somebody I work with introduced me to this restaurant and it was pretty good!! First time we were there, he asked for extra salsa, and our server brought a big bowl of it back! Like a whole soup bowl filled with salsa. We couldn't believe it.  The taste of the steak meat is yummy. It has a certain toughness and just enough charring to make it yummy. I loved the burrito I ordered as well as the quesadilla. I haven't tried any of the more specialty items in their menu.  The atmosphere was so so and a bit divy. However, though I can't say the food was the greatest, I actually crave it and want to come back and eat there. In fact, I had lunch and came back there for dinner one time.   Also, the beans and rice were on the bland side. It can be seasoned better; but I don't mind it as I prefer bland than too salty. I just salt it a bit and problem is solved.  The big plus is it is so cheap! You get a lot of food for the price!"}
{"text":"This was very underwhelming and quite garbage to be honest. We got the queso to start and it tasted like a block of melted pizza cheese. It was served with fresh tortillas instead of chips and was really hard to eat. Luckily our waiter brought us chips.   We got the fajitas to eat and they were very average. Not what you'd expect for $30 fajitas.   This place made me never want to eat Mexican food again. Very overpriced and just not tasty.  Our server Igor was phenomenal though, great server. Did a very nice job."}
{"text":"OMG this place is amazing. Some of the most unique and tasty quacamole and salsas. Really great dishes and the drinks looked fabulous, although I didn't have any.   One flaw was we were there for a birthday celebration and told them when we made our reservation and they did not acknowledge it in anyway."}
{"text":"While warming up for a round of golf, I struck up a conversation with a local and he raved about La Hacienda.  I convinced the remainder of our foursome to give it a try.  We arrived at the Fairmont Plaza and the valet directed us to the restaurant.  After a wrong turn, It seemed like a ¼ mile walk through the elegant plaza.  When we arrived, we were greeted by a pair of beautiful hostesses.  The decor was what I would describe as luxurious southwestern, warm and charming.  The waiter was courteous and helpful.  We ordered margaritas and a bowl of guacamole ($15).  The guac was O.K.  The drinks were good.  I ordered seafood enchiladas.  They were good, but not near the best I've eaten.  The other three guys ordered various dishes, and while not disappointed, they were not overly impressed.  When we got the bill, we were shocked that the small margaritas were $18 each!  There was no price on the menu, and we felt like that was deceitful.  We should have asked the price.    Summary:  Good ambiance, good service, O.K. food, over-priced drinks.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Love how spacious this place is. It can fit all sizes of groups which is why it's never a hassle to stop by.   We always get the parrilladas combination because it feeds about 4 ppl. Order extra beans/rice per person and you'll be set for an awesome meal.   The salsas do lack in flavor. The regular salsa they normally bring out is undesirable, while the requested \"spicy\" salsa is water down and flavorless."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit to the restaurant and it has not disappointed. Family kitchen with family recipes. Friendly and personal service. Try the Cochinita Pibil, it's amazing. But also their chile relleno and tamales are home made and fantastic for Mexican staple foods.  Good selection of seafood options too.  Give the place a try."}
{"text":"La Hacienda is a place I've been visiting for over 15 years for a quick, affordable meal.  We bring our whole family here a lot because we don't have to wait long to get our food.  usually we are in and out in 30 minutes!  The chips and salsa are tasty.  If you want a drink, I would recommend the Horchata.  As for a meal, i've always been a fan of their chicken chimichangas."}
{"text":"Best New Mexican food restaurant in the valley. Born and raised in AZ Mexican food is a staple for my diet; I eat la Hacienda at least once week. It is fantastic. A must try for any person who loves Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Way overpriced.  Tableside guacamole.  Two people, bill was over $250.  I'd say that it was some real expensive Mexican food."}
{"text":"Excellent experience! Food and drinks were great and my clients were very happy with the evening! I had to give 4 stars because the waiter was a little \"off\" during our evening. He had many chances to upsell or make our experience special but just fell slightly below the bar. No huge complaints. A great atmosphere and the grounds are beautiful! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe anyone would give this place less than four stars.  My wife and I started going there about six months ago. We've gone probably 12 times. The food is always fantastic and the service is spot on. This has become our favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. If you order the super nachos get black beans instead of refried beans; you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"I am always on the look out for great Mexican food.  This my yelp friends was not great Mexican food.  The bill was 176 dollars before tip.  I have money and don't mind paying for good food, but this was not worth it.  The steaks my parents had were burnt and the crab enchiladas I had were mediocre at best.  Paying for chips and salsa is ridiculous at a place like this.....  I do not recommend!  Food is up charged and not worth the skyscraper costs.    The only reason I gave them two stars is the habanero dipping sauce was good.  It's hard to make something with like that and have great flavor.  That is all!"}
{"text":"With the exception of a tile mosaic wall with a retro gentleman smiling and branding \"Tequila!\" the whole atmosphere is actually pretty rustic. A large modern bar welcomes visitors to try their large array of tequilas but the back dining areas provide more intimacy.  I enjoyed having one of their spicy Serrano margaritas while my friends enjoyed margaritas with Kah reposado tequila which was obviously much stronger than mine.   Pollo en mole de abuelita- the chocolate was not too sweet and did not have any bitterness either. The chicken was so tender, flavorful and the mole sauce definitely enhanced the preparedness without overpowering the taste buds.  Costilla de Res- banana leaf braised bone in short ribs. I ordered this by recommendation of our waiter. I wanted to try something they were known for. This dish is a true crowd pleaser. It didn't come across as typical southwestern or Mexican cuisine but I really enjoyed this and would have trouble not ordering this again.   Crepas - dessert crepes with ice cream and fruit. Obviously, this was great! You really can't go wrong with dessert crepes but I do want to try the Tres Leches next time."}
{"text":"Guacamole is top notch! If you are a tequila fan you should definitely come here they have a huge variety on the menu."}
{"text":"There is a paradox at La Hacienda. Why would a great Latin restaurant dinner house serve the worst-in-a-lifetime breakfast buffet in this diner's rather extensive experience?  The restaurant is servicing the breakfast with room customers. The scrambled eggs in the buffet were food service quality and left an unwelcome aftertaste with each bite. There was no toast, no toaster, and the breakfast meats (sausage & bacon) were cold.  But, for dinner, totally different. The food was amazing. The steak and short ribs are to die for. The service was superb. The after dinner flambé dessert was both exciting and totally delicious. With their fantastic nighttime ambiance, with lit candles and roaring fireplace, this is definitely the place to bring someone special. Definitely order the at the table guacamole, which rocks, and the after dinner coffee, which throws sparks to the ceiling (ladies and gentlemen, watch your hair when passing by).  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"THE MOST AMAZING MEXICAN FOOD I'VE EVER EATEN!!! This place has an excellent atmosphere, rustic and hip. Their menu is eclectic and a mix of Mexico meets the Southwest.  Guacamole table side any way you want it--to die for! Lobster tacos-tiny bit of heat and sweet buttery lobster.  Salsa-heat, but flavor! Seafood enchiladas robust with crab flavor and wonderful verde sauce.  Tamale, refried beans and rice were delicious.  Finished off with Tres Leches Cake which melted in your mouth and the churros, served with three dipping sauces in edible chocolate cups.  A gem you wouldn't find unless you saw it on Yelp or your friends told you about it!!  Make a reservation!"}
{"text":"I would recommend skipping this restaurant.  Reasons to avoid this place:  1.)  The service is poor.  Example, we waited 42 minutes to place our order.  2.)  The food is poor.  My 4 year old complained that the chicken strips were gross.  4 year olds can be picky and don't make very trustworthy food critics but I tried them and indeed they were disgusting.  I ordered the Carnitas Hacienda and it was quite poor for a $30 dish.  You can drive 5 miles to the Senor Taco in the Walmart parking lot and get far superior Carnitas Tacos.  Senor Taco is delicious btw.  2 Carnitas tacos there will set you back $6.  Seriously I challenge the chef at La Hacienda to go to Senor Taco and learn how to properly prepare some of their dishes.  3.)  The prices are very high for the food quality.  $30-$45 per person is an entry level high end price and the food is Cheesecake Factory quality.  There is much better food locally for far cheaper prices."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to La Hacienda last night while on a \"stay cation\" at the Fairmont. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  We started with guacamole which was great and prepared in front of you at your table. I'm not really one to enjoy that kind if thing and find it to be gimmicky but the gal who did it for us was so sweet and it was quick and to the point.  I had chicken tacos. They were excellent, I really loved the pickled onion on top.  My husband ordered Carne Asada and I don't think I have ever seen him so happy.  I almost forgot, we started with two tequila flights- one anejo and one reposado. The tequila sommelier(for lack of a better word) was knowledgable and friendly and it was fun trying some tequila we might not have tried otherwise.  Our server was on point.  The restaurant is beautiful.  If we had lots of money I'm sure we would go again. $$$$$$$$$$$$$ Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place, it's very clean and family owned. The food is all mom's recipes and they are pretty good. For the price I feel it's a pretty good value and will definitely keep coming back. Our waiter Cesar is the owner's son and very nice and attentive. Food was good , service was good, and restaurant is pretty nice and clean. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"No more happy hour!!!! Staying at the princess, where it is still advertised. Ugh. Can't say anything about the food, just got a snack. It was ok. Small. Drinks yummy, but start at $12. People are nice. Just don't come for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is NOT good Mexican food. It's a lot closer to Chipotle or Qdoba. Everything is sloppily thrown together, generally overcooked, and of poor quality. Portions are also much smaller than other taquerias in town. Tables aren't fully cleaned, and the bathroom is iffy."}
{"text":"Back in the day, resorts and hotels were some of the best culinary destinations around. The Fairmont Scottsdale, formerly known as the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, was one of those shining examples of upscale greatness with its Marquesa and La Hacienda restaurants. With new owners came new ideas, and both establishments were shuttered to make way for culinary concepts, including the fantastic Bourbon Steak by Chef Michael Mina.   Now, with the help of chef Richard Sandoval, La Hacienda is re-opening with an updated look and menu.  Sandoval grew up in Mexico City working with his restaurateur father. His upbringing helped to fuel a passion that led to multiple accolades and a reputation for innovative Latin cuisine. He opened his own restaurant in 1997 and over the years he's opened several more star-awarded restaurants.  La Hacienda has always been known for great margaritas. The traditional La Hacienda ($10) is still the tops, but one of the new comers, the El Pina Diablo ($11) uses pineapple and serrano chile infused tequila and is refreshing and subtly spicy.   In the bar, the daily happy hour runs from 5 to 7 p.m. and features $5 margaritas and snacks ranging from guacamole to tacos.  The dinner menu has been designed to combine \"the bold taste of classic Mexican cuisine with timeless European cooking techniques.\" Starting at the top, you can't go wrong with crunchy Chips and Guacamole ($9.50). The appetizer was fresh and delicious, thanks in part to the tableside preparation of the guacamole. Diners can request their preferred level of spiciness while severs prepare the guacamole.  The Queso Fundido ($9) is served in a searing hot cast iron skillet for good reason -- to keep that cheese molten. A winning combination of melted Oaxaca, Chihuahua and Monterrey cheeses, with chorizo or mushrooms atop, fills the soft house-made flour tortillas perfectly.  Ceviche is one of those dishes that can be disastrous or outstanding, Sandoval and Hamrick served up the latter. The Ceviche Tasting ($10) offers two selections tender rock shrimp with avocado accented with chile habanero or mahi mahi, bathed in a citrus tomato broth, and hinted with just enough chile serrano for another layer of flavor. Both were outstanding, especially when tasted with the accompanied bowl of house-made corn nuts. It's a great texture!  Ever heard of huitlacoche? Also known as corn smut, a type of fungus that grows on corn and is considered a delicacy in Mexico. Call it whatever you like, it's delicious earthen taste shouldn't be missed when eating the Tamal de Huitalcoche ($9). A tamal is the same as tamale, though in this case the masa has been infused with the complex flavors of the huitalcoche, filled with goat cheese and zucchini and drizzled with truffle oil. I felt like a Mayan king eating this.  After trying the Chipotle BBQ Chicken Salad ($12), I felt confused. With so many original dishes, why bother with a salad like this? While the ingredients were top notch and it tasted fine, the ordinariness left me scratching my head.   Making up for this was the Quesadilla ($9), which might sound typical, but after one bite that idea was dispelled. With various fillings, these crispy-on-the-outside, dreamy-on-the-inside quesadillas made for great dipping into the red and green salsas. Fantástico!  Huachinango a la Veracruzana ($26) is a traditional Veracruz style red snapper dish. This gorgeous piece of fish gets a spin with the smoked bacon fufu. A mash of plantains had just enough sweet to balance out the acidic flavor of the tomato, olive and caper sauce.  My favorite entrée, and an instant classic, was the Costilla de Res ($27). The melt-in-your-mouth beef short rib was not only braised, but received a second flavor enhancing method in a smoker. The generous serving of meaty richness was countered by a creamy potato puree and chile habanero and guava sauces.  Desserts are surprisingly light yet still satisfyingly delicious. The Flan de Coco ($9) was perfectly luscious and silky. By contrast, the Churros ($9) had a delightful crunch with a sponge-like interior that absorbed the three different dipping sauces perfectly. La Hacienda also offers house-made ice cream ($8) that includes an avocado version that so good, you might ask for another scoop.  After dessert, coffee is spectacular. The server wheeled out a cart and became not only a mixologist but a pyrotechnician. The columns of burning cinnamon are so beautiful and leave a wonderfully smoky cinnamon smell lingering. These chocolaty rich coffee libations might be a little over the top and full of liquor, but they really shouldn't be missed.  If you have a little too much to drink at La Hacienda you are at one of Scottsdale's finest resorts. Perhaps you can book a night in one of their romantic rooms and make it a mini staycation.  The team at La Hacienda has done a great job paying close attention to the past, but they've set in motion an evolution for a bright and tasty future."}
{"text":"Mexican food for me is usually obtained from a truck in the form of a burrito or taco. I don't often actually go to sit-down Mexican restaurants mainly because the \"good stuff\" was usually served on the sidewalk every other few blocks in Los Angeles.  Anyway, had the shredded beef enchiladas with rice and beans. The enchiladas themselves were tasty (poured sour cream and squeezed 2 limes on it though) and I'm glad I went with the shredded beef instead of ground beef. I don't like beans, so that was never really touched. The rice was a little too dry for my liking. Didn't get a chance to taste the chimichangas my boyfriend got but he seemed to like it.   Service was decent. It was a slow and empty Friday night.  I'd go back again to try other things, but it wouldn't be my first choice for Mexican food."}
{"text":"We came here for Father's Day hoping to taste \"authentic\" Mexican food because yelpers say it is.. Fail!  This is not authentic Mexican food! 3 stars- especially for the server (who told us himself that he is Mexican) who compared Mexican food to Chili's- uh hello! Chili's is not Mexican food!!) The food is NOT bad in any way.  It's their what do you call it.. Fancy, modernized version of authentic Mexican? Mm no thanks! Go to The Mission (now that's fancy, modernized authentic Mexican). The restaurant is very casual (no need to dress up).  I will say they have great service.  We even asked the gentleman clearing our table what he recommends and he says he's never tasted the food. *sigh.. Ok. Dessert menu came we asked server which do you recommend flan or tres leches.  He said bread pudding. Enough said."}
{"text":"We ate here for Father's day.   The food was awesome,  great service. I had the chicken fajitas with rice and beans.   My husband had the veggie quinoa. We had the guacamole and chips for starters. We will eat here again."}
{"text":"We were there after 7:00 on a Saturday....and there weren't many people in the restaurant.  We were waited on immediately.  Chips and salsa came as soon as we sat down.  Salsa had a bit of a kick...and delicious.   Chips were fresh, crisp and warm.  We ate way too many of them. The menu is enormous....making our dinner decision very difficult.  I ordered an enchilada and chili relleno.  The enchilada sauce was good.  Had a sweet hint to it.  I would have preferred a bit more spice.  The chili relleno was perfect. Not too eggy and the right amount of sauce.  Delicious.  The rice and beans were average.  Margaritas were good.  Service was great! My hubby's chicken burrito was delicious.   We will definitely go back.  I want to try the molcajete ....it looked incredible. I also want to try the mole.  Overall a really nice experience."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant have been there few times  Ambiance is great .. we just love there margarita  The best in town . There tortilla soup is what I love and grilled beef steak is also very good ."}
{"text":"From start to finish everything was amazing!! Table side Guac was everything you could ask for. They were very knowledgeable about the tequila and drinks they serve. Filet and carnitas were absolutely amazing!! Angel and Dustin gave the best suggestions and service. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to have an amazing evening along with the best service in the valley!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! We came here after bar close and the place was packed. We had the Parrillidas combination meat plate. It was a huge amount of food and delicious!! It was served with all the goods. It was plenty of food to fill 4 of us and was only about 35 dollars. Great authentic Mexican. The wait was a little long but worth it"}
{"text":"I just went to La Hacienda for lunch this weekend and was seriously disappointed.    The atmosphere: the old section is pretty blah and boring, but the separate dining room to the right of the old section is beautiful. Awesome  natural light and the tables were unique. The difference between the sections was like being in two completely different restaurants.  The food: chips and salsa were just fine, on par with my expectations. I ordered a taco salad (I know, not very authentic but hey, it was what I was craving) and it was by far the worst thing I have ever had in a restaurant in my entire life. The taco shell bowl was tasty, but what was inside was extremely disappointing. The taco salad had beef, a few pieces of lettuce, and a few shreds of cheese. The beef was tasteless, there was no seasoning on it what so ever, and it was so greasy. I literally had to pick up the whole shell and dump the grease out and wipe it off of my plate with a napkin. It had enough grease to fill at least two of the cups their sides of sour cream came in. The taco salad also came with refried beans and Spanish rice. Neither had any flavor what so ever and were even a bit cold. I had to hunt down salt and hot sauce to make it even edible.   My friends all agreed on the general blandness of the food. Two of my friends got chicken chimichangas and they thought they were okay, but just sort of tasted like chicken sandwiches. They said they could have poured BBQ sauce on them and it would have tasted like a pulled chicken sandwich. My other friend ordered chicken tostadas and was not really impressed either.  The service: our waiter must have been brand new, But he was really bad. We only got our water cups refilled once and that was after tracking him down and asking. My friend ordered a side of guacamole as advertised on the menu, and the water came back after putting our order in and asked how much guacamole she wanted. We all thought that was a weird question and were unsure how to answer it. We asked what he meant and he said, \"I don't know. Like 60 cents worth, $1.00?\" Which was still kind of weird, since we didn't know how much accounted for how much of a dollar amount. My friend just told him she wanted the portion that they advertise on the menu, which is $2.00. When it came out it was not very big, which made us wonder how much 60 cents would have been! Once we got our food, we didn't see him for  at least half an hour, never checked in and we were just sitting there waiting for our checks for quite a while.    Maybe we all ordered the wrong dishes, or maybe our waiter was just brand new, but I don't think I will ever give this place a try again."}
{"text":"Went here for my hubby's birthday. The prices were through the roof. That being said, if was worth every penny!!! The guacamole was incredible and enough to feed you for an entire meal. The slow roast melts in your mouth like butter. Service was friendly. Wonderful atmosphere and a beautiful place to go. Will definetely be back."}
{"text":"I was visiting my parents who live close to the Resort that hosts La Hacienda so we decided to eat there for lunch. There weren't very many guests at the resort so La Hacienda was sporting the Bistro's menu, not Mexican as indicated. We ordered two salads and two sandwiches, which was tasty but our bill came to $83.89! A little pricey for a small lunch. When I got home I looked at my bank account as I used a debit card to pay and they added an 18% gratutity to my charge that was not authorized. I always pay cash for my tips so I called the restaurant and was told that they use this practice for every ticket and that the charge will be correct once it's posted to my account. I've never seen this with any business. They must really be full of themselves to try to take a tip twice! I will wait to see if the tip posts or not, but I would not recommend this resort or any of their restaurants if this is their practice! Don't go..."}
{"text":"Prickly Pear Margaritas were ordered by my best friend and her mom-I had to join the party and ooh what a party it was!  YUMM!!    I have to say that I have never had food like this!  I absolutely LOVED the authentic Spanish/Mexican wonderland of flavors which danced (not literally) on my plates.  Following the Prickly Pear party, I enjoyed the most amazing spinach salad: Spinach and Frisee Salad, Sweet and Spiced Pecans, Goat Cheese Croquette with Warm Chorizo Dressing - I want it now!!  Who would have thought that goat cheese in a croquette could be so decadent?    The other members of my party enjoyed the tomato salad, and the chilled avocado soup.  We were all pleased as we moved onto the main course.  My best friends dad went with the suckling pork and I loved my oven roasted chicken.  Atmosphere: We went on a Sunday night so it was very very quite and intimate.  I can imagine it being much more alive on a weekend evening.   Price: I think it was up there but thanks to visiting parents, I was able to dodge this one! Food: Outstanding  I cannot believe I am just the 6th person to review this...lets go Yelpers I know you will LOVE this!"}
{"text":"If you like paying double plus prices then this is the place for you. Begin with their small margaritas for $18 and proceed with their entrees for $25 to $30 and get your child a $4 coke. Food was a little better than average, service was very good and atmosphere was average.  There are a lot of restaurants better for half the price or less. $300 is too much for 4 people."}
{"text":"Super service and great food.  We has the Mexican Rodeo and Ceviche appetizers.  Along with the Bartenders Margarita.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Short ribs - not on the menu as of this review.  Major letdown. Fish tacos - larger than, similar taste to, and far more expensive than Rubios. Carnitas - solid choice, huge coleslaw portion.  Wasn't too dry like some people posted. Chips n salsa - salsa also similar to Rubios.  Chips, better than Rubios pasty chips.  Take the above, throw on the $, and out pops a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"There are many options for getting some authentic Mexican food in the Madison area however, La Hacienda has got to be my top favorite.  La Hacienda is my go to restaurant because the tacos are great and the price is cheap. My usual order are three chorizo tacos served with cilantro, onion, and three slices of lime for that extra tart flavor punch."}
{"text":"Two stars you ask? Yes I am disappointed I had to put two stars! I was ready to get my food socks rocked off. Incorrect.   We went on Saturday night with a monstrous group. 4 children and about 10 adults. We had a rsvp at 7:00, and we were immediately seated. Great! And then it all went down-hill. The children were starving, so we ordered food for them asap (chicken fingers and fries). It took about 45 minutes for the food to come out. It was bizarre. I wonder if they were making the fingers from scratch (egg, flour, shake-and-bake breading, and then frying). They did not seem extraordinary, so I highly doubt that. Luckily, our adult food appetizers had come out a little earlier.   For apps, we got two servings of guacamole and fundido. the guacamole was NOT made table-side. that's the whole point of ordering guacamole! I see the other reviewers got theirs made table-side. I am super jealous. I am an avid lover of guac. I get it at almost every restaurant if it is on the menu. However, this was missing something. I think the avocados were not super ripe. Anyway, it wasn't that good. I had about two chips and called it quits. The fundido was unique: melted cheese served with hot tortillas. You spread the cheese onto the tortilla, roll it up, and eat it. Fun concept. Everyone raved about the cheese. A little greasy, but fun nonetheless. It was a little tricky to spread the cheese onto the tortilla, so perhaps recruit someone at the table to work the fundido station.  I got the tempura sea bass (not on the online menu. the server said it replaced the: \"scallop and pork belly\"). Basically, it was a whole fish (yes, head and tail included) covered in tempura batter. The overwhelming tempura batter drowned out any sea bass flavor. The person next to me got the costilla de res (braised short rib). It was OK. Had a weird flavor to it...i think it was the guava sauce.   Not only were the entrees pricy and mediocre, but they served all the adult entrees at once. One adult at our table's entree did not come out. The server told him they overcooked his steak, and it would be out in a few minutes. The server apologized in advance, but it was definitely rude to bring out our entrees. The steak did not come out for several minutes, and when it did, he said it still wasn't cooked to the specifications he asked for! Eek."}
{"text":"Ok the food I finally received the Steak with enchiladas it was ok, but it took a bit. I told my waiter that I am gluten free. I told him a few times. He said I got it. Well he did not. When I received what he called the best thing on the menu it had something on to that had Wheat in it. I could not have been any clearer. The Steak was ok. It was not great. Also I had a mojito and it was not good. Sorry but you guys need to learn how to make one. Very bad. The one outstanding thing I did eat was the Guacamole, It was so GOOD. Overall I was disappointed in this place. I think it was just a bad night. I may try it again."}
{"text":"Located on the scenic grounds of The Fairmont Resort is as far as I go because FOOD.  Table side guac:  5 stars  Queso chorizo fundido served with fresh made tortillas: 5 stars Entrée/ the house fav. steak enchiladas:  unofficiated 5 stars  - was too full to feel my face or taste..or move. Our server told us the menu selection is seasonal but the steak enchiladas are forever. They're that popular. Too bad I let gluttony take the wheel during phase one.. that fundido though! No regrets.  Hacienda serves up some of the best damn Mexican food in the valley: fact."}
{"text":"This upscale Mexican restaurant serves a different type of Mexican food that we are accustomed to in the Southwest. This place has a distinct taste that can only be enjoyed in the southern region of Mexico. A very Oaxacan indigenous taste. I for one do not really care for enchiladas often I find them overbearing with the flavor of cumin. I would never order that a Mexican restaurant. This place changed my mind about enchiladas. I order the filet a la parrilla (grilled steak), luckily it had two white cheese enchiladas which in my opinion were the real MVP's. Ordering a hot chocolate is quite an experience here. I don't really like tequilas but if I ever wanted to try rare and exotics tequilas this place has them in stock. I love this place. The enchiladas that accompany the grilled steak are heavenly."}
{"text":"Again a great dining experience at la hacienda at the Fairmont Scottsdale. This time we sat in the dining room and our favorite table is 11. It's in a little room with a fireplace. Please don't get stuck in the large room! My wife had the organic margarita and I  had their house. Both great on the rocks (in Hawaii you mainly get it blended).  We again had the guacamole made chair side and it was awesome. Well skip it next time as we need to have something different for an ap. The great find that night was the deep fried sea bass. For dessert we had their sorbet of mint chocolate chip and vanilla. You get three scoops of any combination from about five different flavors. We made reservation for the next evening but got distracted shopping at the Kierland Quarters."}
{"text":"One word.........horrible!   The chips were stale.  We both ordered a beer and the server took it upon himself to bring the large $7.50 beers instead of the 16 oz. $4.00 beer we were expecting.   I ordered the daily special Chalupa which had greasy shredded beef for .75 more and another very stale Chalupa shell, hence, let's get rid of them and call it a daily special.  With tip hands down the worst $40.00 lunch I've ever had."}
{"text":"This was a superb experience - everything about it - the food and the service! What a treat and worth every penny! I was visiting from DC and read about the restaurant so the concierge at the Fairmont  made me a reservation for 1. I had a flank steak dish that was so tender with a Margarita that was the best i ever had. The manager is Edison - what a star- its not every day that you get such star treatment as a single lady traveler!!!"}
{"text":"Got here early, had a wonderful lunch. Food was delicious, service was outstanding!!!! Will definitely be coming back for some more of their creative dishes!!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to enjoy a quick snack and drink for happy hour. Remembering that La Hacienda at the Princess had just reopened, I decided to stop in and check them out.   Walking through the resort's courtyards to the restaurant reminded me of what a nice place the Princess really is and put me in a relaxed frame of mind.   Upon entering La Ha I decided to sit at the small bar right in front of me. I was immediately struck by the large assortment of tequilas on the bar shelves. If you like tequila then this is the place for you. They have over 100 to choose from at any given time.   After looking over the happy hour menu I decided to have a La Hacienda margarita on the rocks. It was made with Sauza Gold tequila, triple sec and fresh lime. Really, it was quite good and at only $4 priced very well.   Moving on to the food I ordered the Duo de Tacos (one beef and one chicken) and the Mahi Mahi ceviche. Both were very good and the ceviche was spicy in the citrus-tomato and chile juices. It might have been nice to have had a little more fish in the dish but again for $4 what more can you expect?   The bar staff were very friendly and the service was good. All in all, a nice experience."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough positives!! I'm a Mexican food snob, this place was amazing. Food was great service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Great location at The Fairmont Scottsdale Princess. Very attentive staff and happy hour is awesome. The Ceviche and table side guacamole is delish. After dinner you have to try the flaming coffee of the tequila bar or both."}
{"text":"We had fish, taquitos, spinach enchiladas. All wonderful. Warm chips and very good sausa. Price is Right. Employees friendly. Atmosphere warm and new. Thanks La Hacienda!"}
{"text":"Ok - so this place is a little bit of a hidden gem.  It is open until 3am every night, except for Friday and Saturday night when it is open until 4am.  You read that right!  The margaritas are tasty, decently priced but nothing special.  I had a taco, tostada, and quesadilla.  The taco and tostada had steak in/on them.  The steak was tasty, fresh and hot.  The topping were fresh, nothing fancy.  Just the usual tomatoes, lettuce, onion, cilantro..etc... The food was flavorful but nothing new.  With a taco it is really difficult to reinvent the wheel.    So if you are looking for authentic Mexican then head over.  The dining room is very sparse so first date place, skip it.  Been dating a few months?  Definitely.  You go here for the awesome hours, good tacos and decent margaritas."}
{"text":"Just ate here December 7th. The restaurant is on the grounds of the Princess Hotel. The grounds are decorated for Christmas and it is beautiful. The restaurant is good but it is a real tourist spot. $16.50 for guacamole and chips? $28 for steak fajitas with no rice or beans? pricey but the food and service are good. A word of advice. If you do not spend $100 at this time of year for dinner, the valet parking will cost you $85!! I guess it keeps the riff wrath out. If you go at this time of year, you will definitely need a reservation. Kudos to the waiter Angel. Great server."}
{"text":"Went to grab some lunch there today with my husband and father-in-law. We were greeted and sat immediately comma or drink order was taken, and chips and salsa placed on the table. The menu has quite a lot to offer . I was originally going to order the shredded beef tacos until I realized the shredded beef contains pork, as someone who doesn't eat pork I found this disappointing...really I said WTF!?....but disappointed sounds classier.   They do have lunch specials until 3 even on the weekends, which is basically a dollar off the regular price. I ordered the fish ceviche as my entree ( from the appetizer menu, $15). It was delicious, flavorful, and just the correct amount to serve as a meal. My husband had a combo plate and he said it was the best chile relleno he is ever had. My father-in-law had the specialty burrito which had chicken in it and covered in a mole type sauce.  The servers are very friendly, fast, and can pretty much answer any question about the menu. Very clean, new restaurant.   I do have to admit that the prices are kind of high, but I'm sure it has to do with the amount of rent they have to pay at the building they are in."}
{"text":"I had the best margarita of my life here, El Pina Diablo. It was mildy spicy but so flavorful and delicious. The food was very good as to be expected at such a nice resort. The pricing is a little high for what the food is but that also is to be expected at such a nice resort. They have a very good kids menu which is helpful."}
{"text":"One of my go to late night Madison restaurants. Went here again last Friday and everything was good as usual. The chips and salsa were good (although I feel like the chips are different, I like really thin ones and these are not). Salsa was perfect.  I had the 3 tostadas - 2 avocado and one beef, I didn't eat the beef one - just too much food. My margarita was disappointing, tasted like lime syrup and not an authentic margarita. Which I'm fine with serving for those on a budget ... just let me know so I get a better one that doesn't leave me a little sad that is what I ordered."}
{"text":"Service was awful. I work in the industry and we have been coming to la hacienda every year for our wedding anniversary and over the years have notice the service and food quality declining and prices increasing.  My husband told the hostess it was our anniversary because they asked and not one person even acknowledged it. Why ask is we are celebrating something special?!? We order what used to be table side guacamole and now they basically just mashed it at the table, that was $15. $14 for maybe an half an ounce of tequila in my margarita. We then ordered the fajitas to split for $27 they came with 3 tortillas and when we asked for more they never mentioned anything to us but charged us $3!!! This place used to be so special but it's looks like we will be trying bourbon steak next year. Adios !"}
{"text":"Stopped in 4 pm on a Thursday before the evening rush. Very friendly employees!  Chips and salsa were great.  Very fresh, hot chips, with s mild salsa.  You can always make something hotter but you can't make it more mild!  Daughter had mole chicken enchiladas and I had shredded beef enchilada suiza.  Very good!  I haven't tasted as good mole since Plaza Cafe In Sante Fe!    Hey have a huge menu!  I mean really huge wit a lot of variety from chicken to seafood!  I can't wait to go back.   I like the ambiance with Mexican Movie Stars of yesteryear on display.  Really cute  I found the prices very reasonable and food portions well sized."}
{"text":"I have not read anything about the labor disputes, and am only going to review this place based on the food and the service I've received upon going several times in the past:  I love the food.  I particularly love going there for breakfast.  You can get a seriously filling huevos rancheros & coffee for under $10 with tip.  Nothing I have had there has been disappointing or dissatisfying.  The service is always pleasant.  You get dum dum's with your check.  :)"}
{"text":"The food is very creative, fresh, and simply delicious! The lamb ribs were perfectly smoked and just the right amount of tangy BBQ sauce. The chips and table side made guacamole is seasoned just right and will be made chunky or smooth. The beef short ribs are very meaty and tender. The churro is perfectly fried crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with 3 yummy dipping sauces. The carnitas and filet both had rave reviews from the table as did the ice cream sandwich dessert and plantain split."}
{"text":"Finally something different being done with Mexican food.  This place is seriously delicious.  Went here for a work function which promised to be boring - the food and drinks were anything but.  It's now a fav spot."}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst.  Food was ok to good.  Went here thinking I was trying out a Mexican restaurant I had read good reviews for on Yelp.  The reviews I had read were actually for Taqueria Guadalajara, but we ended up here.   There weren't many cars in the lot but there were a few families there to eat.  We walked in and had to wait a while to be greeted.  The gentleman was pleasant and seated us.  The menu is too busy for my taste.  Prices were fair for the meals served and I would say moderate in price.  I had some Chimichangas which were pretty good.  They are the small kind, about 4 inches long and stuffed with meat.  The chicken was not as moist as I would like it but not dry.  (Dry chicken is a big problem at Mexican restaurants from my experience.)  The sauces and sour cream was watered down, runny, which I have also seen at other Mexican Restaurants.  Is this a way to make the salsa stretch?  Not sure.  Maybe they like it this way.  The sauce wasn't near enough either, had to order more. The chicken burrito was large but mostly meat.  Needed more rice, beans etc.  We weren't too thrilled with this.   The eating area is pretty large. It is like a large cafe.  It would be a good place for lunch if you had a large group and wanted something quick.  For dinner I would go elsewhere. With so many other good places to go to I would say not to bother with La Hacienda. One last thing.  I got the impression that the staff didn't really want to be there.  Like they were holding things together.  Not the best spirit to impart."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the experience and the food.  Caesar was our server and very friendly and attentive. He gave the good suggestions about what to try.  I had the Mexican stew, I cannot spell or pronounce it.  It was very good.  The chips were warm the salsa was a little spicey to start with.  All  the food was fresh and not greasy, and the place was very clean.  Good lunch specials."}
{"text":"This is probably the best high-end Mexican restaurant I've been to so far in Arizona. The food was absolutely delicious from the appetizer to desert. Would definitely recommend and come back here."}
{"text":"The food at La Hacienda at the Fairmont Princess never ceases to amaze me.  It is always amazing with a creative twist.  I always wonder how they think of what to put on their menu, which is always changing.  With the fire burning and the mariachi band playing, its atmosphere is relaxing yet with entertainment.  With Bourbon Steak and Rande Gerber's new lounge, Stone Rose, opening soon, La Hacienda and the Fairmont Princess must be on everyone's list to visit.  La Hacienda is like no other Mexican restaurant that you have been to; it's gourmet Mexican!  And don't forget to order the flaming coffee - this is a must see!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I had some time to kill and was in the mood for some chips and salsa and a margarita. So we jumped on Yelp to see what was in the area and this place popped up. So we decided to stop in and were very happy we did. We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken. Chips and salsa were brought to the table while we reviewed the menu. The chips were nice and crunchy and the salsa was good -  although I do prefer my salsa more chunky and this was a little more on the watery side. It was not very spicy although it did have a little kick to it. I saw they had ceviche on the menu so I just had to try it. We went with the shrimp and it was very good. Although we hadn't planned on eating a full meal right then, after seeing all the pictures on the menu (and seeing what was walking by as they were serving other people) we decided to go ahead and eat dinner. Hubby saw their specialty burrito came with mole so he had to try it. He has been trying to find a place here in the valley with good mole and so far we have not had very good luck. He ordered it with chicken and was very happy with it. He preferred this mole much more than the place we tried it at a few weeks ago so I was very happy for him. I tasted it and it did have a really good flavor and was not too spicy.  I forget the name of the dish I ordered but it was grilled shrimp with pineapple and cheese baked in half of a pineapple. It came with rice, a side salad, and your choice of tortillas. The mango salad dressing they served with the side salad was amazing. We asked for another side of it (as hubby wanted some on his side of lettuce) but they said they ran out and were in the process of making more but would we mind waiting for it and they would bring more when they were done? I said that was fine but unfortunately they must have forgotten because they never did bring us anymore.  I had been craving fried ice cream for a while now so we decided to try theirs. It was good but the crunchy coating on the outside was not very crunchy and it was very thin for my tastes.  I prefer my coating a bit thicker. So all in all we both really enjoyed our meals and definitely want to come back to try some of their other entrées. Who knows when that will be however since we live way on the other side of the valley.   But both of our daughters live very close to here so we happily recommended this place to the both of them!"}
{"text":"I am giving it 5 stars for the food.  I had the seafood enchiladas and my wife had the chicken molcajete.  Both meals were excellent and and the ingredients were really fresh. I would highly recommend both of these meals.  Our service was great.  The inside of the restaurant is decorated nice.    Where I'm not sure if it should get 5 stars is that it is small and located along a little strip mall.  The price is kind of high, they charge for soda drink refills and I love great chips and salsa and theirs were both just okay.     With that being said, we will definitely be back because the meals were fantastic."}
{"text":"I thought the food here was really bland and not particularly fresh tasting and the prices weren't that great either- I think we paid $8 for a tostada with avocado (no meat) and a $6 for a large chicken enchilada, which was more like 1.5 X the size of a typical enchilada. Both were a la carte.  On the plus side, the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I got a burrito and unlike a few other authentic places in town, the quality of the meat is noteworthy. No gristle, not fat and very delicious. Price is right and although the size could be a little bigger, they do pack a good amount of meat in there. Will return."}
{"text":"Ate at La Hacienda on Thanksgiving Eve. Truly exceptional food and service. Expensive but worth it.      We made a meal for four from appetizers. All were exquisite. Guacamole sampler was inventive. Empanadas were wonderful. Best of all the sweet corn tamales. Chocolate flan was sinful."}
{"text":"We are on the hunt for a new Mexican restaurant after the Laredo's down the street closed. After a visit to La Hacienda, we will keep looking.   The salsa was bland - the margaritas tasted like they came from a premixed bucket - and the food was just flavorless.   Next time we'll trek a little further south on Park and go to Taqueria Guadalajara."}
{"text":"The ambiance is excellent. I loved the furniture, warmth, overall vibe. Service was very attentive and friendly.   Food wise it was good but not great."}
{"text":"Love their guac.  Made table side.  Saw Tim Tebow here which was a plus. ;)  Yum.  It is a bit pricy for Mexican food, but you are in a hotel - a resort hotel - so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"High end Mexican Restaurant?  Is there such a thing?  Sure there is!  La Hacienda is a perfect example of that.  Located inside the Fairmont Princess Resort, this gem offers a high end Mexican dining experience.  We've been here for happy hour and they have great Margaritas and we've come for dinner.  The dinner is spectacular.  Here's what we ordered:  Guacamole, $14 (prepared tableside) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=2JkVDRonRyvi3jZx4_qUuw#2JkVDRonRyvi3jZx4_qUuw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=SROog3ZPUjd0R0GZ2r8HPg#SROog3ZPUjd0R0GZ2r8HPg  Queso Fundido, $14 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=fQNZkQPkLvIckEZDr9vdVg#fQNZkQPkLvIckEZDr9vdVg  Tampiquena, $30 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=X-viGoMAkqDhmK28EWS9qg#X-viGoMAkqDhmK28EWS9qg  Chicken Mole Poblano, $24 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=BURdzfDTQHaCEKxlrd2OXw#BURdzfDTQHaCEKxlrd2OXw  Barbacoa de Res Taquitos, $14 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=VjETCzzdeXy2X2xDAuDAUA#VjETCzzdeXy2X2xDAuDAUA  Capirotada, $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=aGiE3CUwG1_n1NyO_d1BVg#aGiE3CUwG1_n1NyO_d1BVg  Trio de Helados Fritos, $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=4fhS2VZDUj07JKdJ_e6IsA#4fhS2VZDUj07JKdJ_e6IsA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-hacienda-by-richard-sandoval-scottsdale?select=t5RYGd6HJBlje0-2aAKOwA#t5RYGd6HJBlje0-2aAKOwA  For appetizers, the tableside Guacamole is phenomenal....smooth and creamy.  They don't add too many Onions & Tomatoes, which is a mortal sin for Guac and most restaurants do that.  The Queso Fundido is excellent and comes with fresh, homemade Tortillas....definitely not store bought.  For the entree, I had the Tampiquena, which is a Steak cut thin and served with an Enchilada, Corn Mash, and Guacamole.....another excellent dish!  The Enchilada is covered in Mole Sauce, which offers a smooth, chocolatey taste to compliment the Steak.  Amazing.  Kiddo and The Wife had the Chicken Mole Poblano and the Barbacoa Taquitos.  They loved their dishes and finished their plate.  Dessert was the Capirotada and the Trio de Helados Fritos.  All I can say is yum!  I could only muster a bite of each because I was stuffed.  The family finished the rest.  Service was spectacular throughout dinner.  I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Scottsdale.  Return Factor - 95%"}
{"text":"We were there a few nights ago.  Being from Chicago, we are used to outstanding Mexican food. Though we were not unhappy with what we ate, it didn't blow us away or impress us at all.  Most importantly, the prices are totally outrageous!  As one reviewer stated, you can go elsewhere for less money.  It's very expensive for a Mexican restaurant.  I would not go back here again."}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely love this place. The dishes are always great (we have had many) and the service is always on point. There are many times when they are extremely busy and it is understaffed, but they seem to do just fine. This has been our go to Mexican Style Restaurant for 10 years."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday and the food was delicious the service was outstanding the manager ceasar made sure everything was great barbecue pork taco was amazing the chicken and shrimp had a fresh taste to then will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Amazing food, staff and decor! Highly recommend you try many different dishes! The patio is a nice feature! They have a Live DJ on Thursday's, which is cool!"}
{"text":"Great food, and a rarity in Madison, IT'S OPEN TILL 4 AM?  can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Horrible atmosphere, food marginal at best, bad cocktails"}
{"text":"We had such good food, drinks and service that we cancelled a reservation elsewhere to go a second time while we were in-town for the holidays. The chips & salsa, and the guac(!), is on-point. We tried the queso one night (good) and were able to get the smokey salsa (great) that comes with the queso the other night to have 2 great fresh salsa options with our chips for our second dinner there.  The Carnitas Hacienda (pork shoulder) was so good, and the slaw that came with it was phenomenal! Our group also enjoyed the enchiladas and a variety of the margaritas. We split the churros for dessert - it was great. There were about 6 churros, with 3 dipping chocolates (one may have been carmel...yeah, margarita brain here) that were each in a chocolate cup that you could eat."}
{"text":"Bland, and was not authentic at all.. even the taco shells were cheap store bought shells. Chicken seemed like it was out of a can... yuck.. I was excited because all the good reviews. This was a disappointment though."}
{"text":"Excellent!! This place is great! I think we had a taste of about everything on our recent trip to this fantastic restaurant. It's located in the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Resort. We were not staying there but made a special trip just to try it out after hearing and reading great reviews. Very nice relaxing Mexican themed atmosphere. Amy was our server and she was great. Items we ordered: Guacamole made table side. This was the best guac I've ever had. They ask how you want your avocados, (mashed fine or chunky) I thought all guacamole was about the same but I was proven wrong. It's a  perfect mixture of ingredients and spices. Our entrees were the \"Filet a la Parilla\" and \"Seafood Enchiladas.\" The filet came on top of the best cheese enchiladas I've had in my life. They are made with many cheeses including Oaxaca.  The filet is grilled in a coriander spice and served with some type of sauce with red and green peppers underneath the Filet but on top of the enchiladas. (this is the best way to describe it). We also had several of the margaritas including the \"Original\", the \"La Hacienda\" and the \"Cadillac.\" My husband also had a \"Horizontal Flight\" which consists of three different families of tequilas. Dessert was Cinnamon Churros and a specialty coffee. They flame the coffee table side to add to your dining experience. A great experience. Give this place a try even if you are not staying at the resort."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for a few years and it is, by far, my favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison. Their meals are huge and their margaritas are to die for. I have always been seated quickly and have been well attended to by the staff. They give you salsa and chips while you wait for food and it's probably the most basic salsa but I would honestly go there just to eat vats of it.   Their dinners come with beans and rice, both are delicious. I always end up taking home leftovers because the servings are pretty big. I was not a big fan of their beans this last time I went - they seemed kind of watered down or something, but normally they are delicious.   You can get your margaritas blended or on the rocks and they have so many flavors to choose from. Your size options are small, medium, large, or pitcher. Their sugar/salt rims seem to be a bit inconsistent. Sometimes they have them, sometimes they don't.   They're also open late so they're good for a late night appetizer or drink! But know that they will not split checks after midnight."}
{"text":"We went during phx open.  So happy place takes reservations because they were backed.   All i have say is service was great, drinks were yummy, and food was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has gone downhill. It is way over priced for the quality of the food. The fajitas came out warm and not sizzling. The tortillas we're god awful limp grease infused something. We figured the left out the banking soda for their \"home made' tortillas. The executive chef should be embarrassed to have this level of food leave his/her kitchen. We live in Scottsdale, and have been going to this restaurant for years but never again...we had the same poor experience last year. La Hacienda, get your game on like you had five years ago, otherwise we might as well go to Chili's and save us some money. But I must say the host staff was excellent and so was the valet..but the kitchen needs to reinvent itself as a superior Southwest cuisine restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is weird because when you walk up, it's a bright yellow building with Mexican decor and music playing...then you walk inside, and it's an old Ruby Tuesday's or something.  The TVs were all playing Univision...guess that counts for some authenticity points!  The service was friendly and quick.  Chips and salsa are free (and unlimited), but that was my favorite part of the meal.  The food is okay but rather bland, and required a dousing of the four kinds of hot sauce set out on the table.  I would come back with friends for drinks (and chips and salsa), but that's it.  Although it's not saying much, there are better Mexican places in the 'burgh."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Madison for Mexican food!!! Love the atmosphere, great margarita's and open late!  The staff is always friendly and I have never had bad food, EVER!!! A definite must!"}
{"text":"I have not returned to La Hacienda since I found out they were (allegedly) taking advantage of some of their employees. Their labor issues will impact my star rating, but even without the labor issues, I don't think La Hacienda is that great.  Yes, they are open late, and that is great.  But I don't think their food is great, really at all.  If given the option, I would take Casa de Lara over Hacienda hands down anytime.  Probably even Laredo's or El Pastor.  I guess one other nice thing is that they have lollipops.  But that still does not win me over."}
{"text":"I loved the Fairmont in Scottsdale... that is in all other regards, except my dining experience at La Hacienda.  I understand and have been advised that it's an award winning restaurant, but it just did not wow me.  My companion and I started with the ceviche, but found it to be mediocre at best - quite bland in taste (needing salt, lemon, lime, spice and/or some combination of the foregoing) and the texture of the fish speaking volumes of its true nature - over cooked fish - blah.    HOWEVER, the meal did improve - the tortillas, beans and salsa were wonderful alternatives to bread and tapenede (the beans were to die for).  And our entrees (scallops with fried avocado and a tomatilla (sp?) sauce and a beef tenderloin so decadent and smooth, it had the texture of butter) were more than adequate to compensate for our failed starter.  Neither my companion nor I were too hungry, so we passed on dessert, but I can attest to the most enjoyable character of their cocktails (try the prickly pear margarita).    Not sure if I'd return to this restaurant on a return visit to Scottsdale (as the hotel now has one headed up by Michael Mina), but it was a nice experience highlighted with a lovely room."}
{"text":"Visit #2. Just as amazing. You must start with a consultation from the tequila sommelier. She recommended two limited edition Herradurra repasado's. One a 2013 finished in scotch oak barrels the other in 2014 Cognac barrels. Both nice, but I favor the scotch edition.  For dinner I had the short rib. Mrs had the snapper. OMG good.  Just awesome! We'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Tortilla soup started you off with a nice spicy kick.  Next we had the shrimp ceviche which had succulent plump shrimp that had amazing flavor!    Finished with the beef fajitas, coconut flan and crispy cinnamon churros.    An amazing meal, lightening fast service"}
{"text":"Just an overall great place to grab drinks and dinner with friends...  Not as high priced as advertised, so don't let the $$$ scare you off if you are just looking for a great restaurant.  Amazing cocktails, the Filet and Enchiladas are to die for and you can't go wrong with their dessert.  Maybe my new favorite in Scottsdale..."}
{"text":"This has been a family go to since I was little. It's fast and good. I get the burrito Chico because the regular burritos are huge. I also love the pics they serve."}
{"text":"To be honest I find most of the Mexican restaurants in Madison to be of similar quality. That being said, I enjoy this place about equally as most other places I've been to in the area. The thing that stands out here is their special meat platter (I'm sorry I forgot the name). It's a really big portion and good for 2-3 slightly hungry people. Their prices are very reasonable. Come here and have a good time!"}
{"text":"Great modern Mex food with a flare, flaming coffee was a great show and the tequila list is huge the table side guac is a must."}
{"text":"Such a great deal for lunch!   We stopped in the other afternoon after hitting up a weekday morning movie in Fitchburg. I had last been to La Hacienda over a decade ago, and after an aborted attempt to get a late dinner there a couple of weeks ago (the parking lot was jam packed and we couldn't get a big enough break in traffic on Park to get back across the street after seeking out other parking) we've had it on the brain.   Upon entering we were quickly seated and served chips and salsa and had our drink orders taken. The salsa came in adorable tiny cups that allowed us each to dig in to our own. Our server was very sweet and attentive, and made for an even more pleasant experience than the delicious food would have on its own.   They have several lunch deals that come with a soda, and both of us ended up ordering the chimichanga plate. I went with chicken, my boyfriend went with beef, and we were both really happy with our choices. The lunch portion is, from what I remember, exactly the same as the dinner portion. I had more food than I could take down in one sitting, so I was pumped to have dinner later with my second mini chimi (they opt to give you two smaller fried burritos instead of one massive one).   I don't know if they've actually updated the interior a bit in the years that I haven't been, or if it just looked brighter and cheerier in the light of day, but either way it was a pleasant atmosphere for our lunchtime jaunt."}
{"text":"This is a solid longtime establishment - it's a solid Mexican joint. Nothing special, but decent service and a pretty big menu with some unique options. You can order beef tongue as an protein option."}
{"text":"This was, by far, my favorite restaurant at the Fairmont Resort. Having been recently taken out of Dallas, TX, due to my significant others' business plans, I began to miss all of the fabulous Tex-Mex choices that Dallas served on every block. La Hacienda to the rescue! We were staying at the Fairmont for continuing ed, and since the resort is so luxurious, why even leave!? Jk... We did explore a little. BUT.... We spent a lot of time at the Fairmont too. Having said all of that, La Hacienda was definitely our best meal on the property. Also... Loved the guac! :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food!  My wife and I stopped in for a Arizona Southwest experience and we were both really pleased with La Hacienda.  It's in the Fairmont resort which we weren't staying at, but is very fancy. The restaurant seated us right away and even moved us from our first table which was very high traffic to a lower traffic area. I hadn't mentioned anything to the hostess or waiter, they just read my mind.  Our server, Julio, was super happy to see us. Not sure why, but he sure made us feel welcome there.  We ordered 3 dishes, we weren't crazy hungry. The fresh made guacamole, the tacos de puerco, and the empanadas. The guacamole was made table side and it was very good. Their chips and salsas were very good too. Not chunky but fresh and flavoful. The serrano chile in the guacamole gave it a little kick of heat.  They tacos and empanadas arrived next. The tacos were incredibly tasty. A two bite portion bursting with bacon and pineapple flavors. The pork was browned and cubed finely and the the salsa had bits of pineapple, yellow bell pepper, onion and some other deliciousness. Combined it was better than I thought a Hawaiian taco would be.  The empanadas managed to hold their own to the tacos. The pastry shell was perfectly cooked, delicate and crisp. The filling cheesy with bits of shrimp in there. Fantastic too.  They were all small dishes split between the two of us. We left sated and feeling like we had some amazing service. I'd definitely come back the next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"A fantastic place for Mexican food and a margarita. The staff is very friendly!They have over 200 kinds of tequila !Coconut shrimp was tasty. It is only three shrimp but they are large The  fundito was delicious . The  only problem was I couldn't eat anything else after that because I was so full. My husband said the guacamole was fresh and good as well . This is a great place for dinner especially if you staying at the hotel because it's super convenient too !"}
{"text":"The best!!!!!  Try the guacamole sampler and the queso fundido. Yum!"}
{"text":"La Hacienda is one of the many restaurants where, after an initial visit, I praised them. But after returning a second time exactly one year later, I ended up dropping the rating after quickly realizing that things aren't quite as good as we remember.  La Hacienda is tucked away deep inside the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess resort. If you're just coming here to eat dinner, you'll be forced to use valet parking. Be sure to get your server to validate your ticket.  As for the restaurant itself, it's very nicely decorated. But as usual, I'm more focused on the food. Chips and salsa are fine. Their guacamole, which has apparently went from 15 dollars to 16 dollars in the last year, isn't quite worth what they're asking. We've had it done better and we've had it done cheaper. I'd suggest passing, or trying one of their more creative guac options beyond the traditional recipe.  For the first visit, I ordered the Filet a la Parilla, which is grilled beef tenderloin (cooked medium). The filet sits atop two Oaxaca cheese enchiladas and also includes some chile pasilla gastrique. My meat was cooked perfectly and I was quite pleased with the overall quality.    My girlfriend has tried the Tampiquena, which includes skirt steak (cooked medium well). This includes a mole cheese enchilada, cactus pico, guacamole, chile poblano, and potato gratin. She's quite picky about her mole, but appeared to like the quality of what they offered here. However, she ordered some carnitas enchiladas on a return visit and discovered that the mole recipe has been altered, which now includes a bit of spice. Carnitas quality, however, was decent.  I've tried their barbacoa tacos, which are fine, but really no different than what you can find at any respectable Mexican joint that knows what they're doing. Cutting a single slice of lime into thirds is embarrassingly stingy, but whatever. The taco meat was good quality, but not worth the 26 dollars they're asking.  Additional changes we discovered were the absence of the Oaxaca cheese mash, which has apparently been eliminated as a side during the last year despite being a big fan of it during our first visit.  For dessert, they offer some great-tasting churros. Although unlike most churros we've had, these are incredibly moist, soft, and practically melt in your mouth. Previously, the dish included three separate dipping sauces, contained in edible chocolate cups. As if that isn't clever in and of itself, each cup was a separate type of chocolate (milk, dark etc). Once again, they've also eliminated this, now providing you with a single plate of chocolate sauce, but still charging you as if you're getting the previous highly-stylized version. Pathetic!  So, after seeing pictures and videos of their flaming coffee, we reluctantly agreed to order one. Neither one of us are big fans of liquor, but we took a risk and ordered the Café Caballo - as it seemed like the least intimidating out of all their concoctions. This included Bailey's, creme de cacao, and frangelico. We assumed the coffee was served cold, but it was actually steaming hot. For the first trip, it was delicious, containing a rather complex flavor that in absolutely no way felt harsh on the booze end (which is what we both feared). Once again, in less than a year, they decided to up its price from 14 dollars to 20 dollars. During our second experiment, the drink tasted more harsh from the booze - while the server also seemed absolutely miserable while making it. Obviously, this does nothing to help his quest for a good tip. Additionally, they seem to have eliminated what was previously a longer list of different flaming coffee options, narrowing them down to just three choices.  Overall, I originally gave this restaurant four stars. However, after returning a second time and discovering that they've eliminated items, arrogantly upped the prices, and exposed their inconsistencies, I don't feel the place is really worth it. I was originally surprised by their 3.5 star average. But now? It all makes sense.  Try them once and be done with it."}
{"text":"This was my second visit. The first visit I was excited to find a new place with reasonable prices. This visit not good and probably won't return. I ordered 4 shredded beef tacos. My order was take-out and produced within 5 minutes of ordering. These were not freshly made-to-order, they must have been stored in a refrigerator and brought out to fill my order as the taco shells were soggy, falling apart, and stone cold! I had to get back to work, so I didn't get a chance to go back and/or complain to a manager. What a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"We were underwhelmed. The margaritas were good but overpriced. The \"table-side\" guacamole was not prepared table-side at all and was bland. Both of our entrees came out lukewarm. For $36 I expected my skirt steak to be on point. Instead it was chewy and the entree as a whole was tiny. Overall everything was overpriced and just ok."}
{"text":"Amazing place. A little on the pricy side but definitely worth it. I was seated in the outdoor area and was delighted when I was led to my table. In the middle of the table was a mini fire pit! Along the edges of the table were fire heat lamps that kept us nice and toasty. The view was beautiful, overlooking palm trees and the beautifully decorated resort. I started off with a prickly pear margarita and the chorizo potato empanadas. The prickly pear margarita was tangy yet refreshing, the empanadas were to die for...the pastry surrounding the slightly spicy chorizo was perfectly golden and delicately flakey. Picked the seafood enchiladas as my main course. They were filled with crab, shrimp, and a lovely creme sauce. Sauce wasn't overpowering and the seafood was fresh. I'd totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great Easter brunch.  Best ever!  Can't wait til next year.  They do it right!!! Kids at a blast with bunny-land, pony rides, magic show, jumpers and more.  From the time we arrived, til the time we left, world class experience."}
{"text":"The venue had outdoor seating, but it was CHILLY that evening and we had a table by the fire place, but I still felt a draft from the front door. Our server was knowledgeable and polite. We started off with the EMPANADAS de CHORIZO con PAPA which was fresh and tasty. I thought about taking pictures of the food, but thought otherwise. My wife had the Prickly Pear  Margarita which looked really refreshing. I'm a 'wuss' when it comes to alcoholic drinks, turning all different shades of red especially my eyes. We split the CHIPOTLE BBQ  ENSALADA which was a little heavy on the dressing, but was still delicious.  Our main course consisted of ENCHILADAS de MARISCOS and CAMARONES al TEQUILA. The Enchilada has good serving of shrimp and crab and the Camarones were cooked perfectly. Good thing I didn't have lunch.  We ended the meal with coffee and Cinnamon Churros. It was a great dining experience and will return to try more of their menu items."}
{"text":"Recently visited on recommendation of a friend who is a regular here. Very open dining room with a lot of seating. Friendly servers and fast service. The chips and salsa are just okay, but the entrees are very tasty and the food is authentic. Great prices too!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant for those looking for authentic Mexican food and great margaritas! Great service."}
{"text":"I have had the mariners enchiladas 3x now & each time this authentic Mexican food does not disappoint. Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Princess and wanted to try their well known Mexican restaurant. We were able to get a reservation the same day, which was nice. They greeted us warmly when we came in and seated us right away. Our waiter was pleasant, although not overly attentive.  We wanted appetizers and margaritas, not a heavy meal, but many of the entrees sounded delicious. We started with drinks, I had a margarita on the rocks with a Grand Marnier float, delicious. My friend wanted a pineapple margarita, but the one they had on the menu was a spicy version with pineapple and jalapeno. No problem, the waiter said, we can leave the jalapeno out. When it came to the table she took a sip and her eyes got wide... they did not leave out the jalapeno! She is a spice wimp, but I tasted it and loved it, the sweet and spicy are pretty addictive. They brought her a new one right away with no jalapeno!  We shared the guacamole sampler and it was really good. There were three different kinds, bacon, crab and pomegranate. The house made chips and salsa that were served with it were also good. The salsa is medium spicy with a roasted flavor.  We also split the beet salad, it was just okay. More watermelon than anything else. I had the quesadilla with carne asada. The flavor was great, the meat was very good and very tender. They looked more like empanadas than a quesadilla, but I liked it.  My friend was disappointed with the style of the tortilla soup. It was a thicker, creamed soup, with not a lot of the usual toppings, not the broth style with chunks of chicken, avocado  and veggies she was expecting.  Overall it was a nice experience and the food was very flavorful. They don't hold back on the spice, which is nice too. It is expensive, our 2 drinks and appetizers were $90.00 before tip."}
{"text":"We stayed at The Fairmont Princess in Scottsdale Az and decided to try this restaurant as it was on the hotel grounds. The smell of delicious food drew us in and we were not disappointed. The service was outstanding and the food was even better. The flavors were incredible and we ate everything on our plates. We couldn't stop thinking of the chicken/steak/shrimp mix fajitas or the braised short rib dinner. Both were amazing. The drinks weren't bad either. This is a place I would drive out of my way to go to again. We loved it."}
{"text":"Definitely not the best Mexican food I have ever had.  The portions seemed pretty small based on what they charged and the flavors were pretty bland.  I had the cheese enchiladas with rice and beans.  The enchiladas had hardly any sauce and were very greasy.  The rice was really blah and I didn't even touch the beans.  On the up side though the service was great!  Very fast and very friendly."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place for lunch today for the first time for Cinco de Mayo. Their chips were warm and crunchy and their salsa was delicious. I ordered the habanero salsa for some extra heat. At first I was dismayed by their large menu because that usually means a long wait and mediocre food. But the waiter explained the restaurant's recipes originated in Jalisco in central Mexico with many unique items. I ordered the lunch chicken mole while my wife ordered the spinach enchiladas. Our food arrived swiftly on hot plates. My mole was some of the best I've ever had! The waiter said that they use 5 kinds of chilies in the sauce with just a hint of chocolate. My wife enjoyed her spinach enchiladas too. Next time I will have to get the molcajete, or the ceviche, or the chile relleno burrito...or the cochinita pibil. So many great choices!  I'm addicted."}
{"text":"Excellent!  I wanted so bad to eat there the next night but couldn't make it back from Sedona in time. The filet on cheese enchiladas?  Divine and melted in my mouth like butter. The chicken mole...best I've ever eaten!  I'll miss this dish when I return home. The group I was with had the tableside guacamole and can't stop raving about it. We all split dessert and had the churros and empanadas. They were excellent as well.  I'll make this a regular stop. Thanks Richard Sandoval, great execution!"}
{"text":"Good table side guacamole , the mini steak tacos were tasty, the grilled sea bass, didn't taste do fresh. The the queso dip with chipotle was tasty.  All in all, it was good, not great."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a good experience at this restaurant. I highly recommend the guacamole sampler it was fantastic!  The food was good and service was good but nothing stood out from most other Mexican restaurants I have been to. Desert coffee was a must as well it had great flavor and he put on a decent little show while making it."}
{"text":"The food was great ! The guacamole was great. Margarita during happy hour is exactly what I needed Huge menu with a lot of variety from you \"usual\" combos with taco, enchilada etc to some really flavorful fish dishes  It's slightly more expensive then other Mexican food restaurants in the area but you get what you pay for"}
{"text":"Danielle the tequila goddess doesn't have \"Tequila Goddess\" as her official title for no reason. She is the restaurant's tequila buyer and knows her tequilas. She arranged a tasting for our group. The restaurant was not busy at all on Saturday night, but was packed on Sunday -- probably the night that business groups check into the Fairmont for their week's meetings. La Hacienda was understaffed for the size of the crowd, but nevertheless the service staff did a good job under the circumstances. Food arrived warm, not hot, but was tasty. The guacamole made at the table is spectacular and you can specify spicy, medium, or mild.  Margaritas are the real deal.  For a different margarita experience, try the margarita with the serrano chile-infused tequila and pineapple.  I liked it!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.  La Hacienda is a GREAT late nite joint if you're in a the mood for food that isn't from the drive through. It serves as a great convenience for larger groups and the services is AMAZING. I have dined here on several occasions and I have never had a bad experience with a server.  The food overall is solid. You're started off with chips and pico de gallo ( bottomless). The Pico is possible the best pico I've tasted at a restaurant. I always ask for more. The menu is extremely large. It's hard not to find something on it that doesn't t appeal to you no matter how much of a picky eater you are. I am a fan of their taco dinner or fajitas. Both meals come with spanish rice, pinto beans ( which I do not care for and never order) and the toppings for your meal. Please be warned, guac and sour cream is extra. I am OK with the guac being extra but why pay more for sour cream that comes in a small container that is the side of a quarter? I do feel that they are being very cheap on that front. Sour Cream should come with every meal free of charge! Also, I don't care too much for their chicken so I stick with steak.   Overall, the food is good. Location is good. Service is good. Their location is perfect. It's really how they are able to make money. You're near downtown and UW Madison Campus. Lots of bars around the area and they stay open very late. Winning recipe for making profit."}
{"text":"The margarita, our server, and the queso appetizer are the saving graces of this review... The actual dinner entree portion of our meal was terrible. The dining room is a weird combination of what looks like old conference room furniture with little other decor or ambiance. Nothing I can't overlook if the meal is great, which unfortunately wasn't the case on Saturday night... Both the steak burrito and the vegetable fajitas were bland and nothing worth paying for. The fajitas were just a steamed plate of vegetables without any seasoning whatsoever and included an odd mixture of produce. We both left our dinner eating only the appetizer."}
{"text":"Best service EVER! Called over phone and he remembered my order as I entered even though it was busy. Food was fresh, hot and delish"}
{"text":"Guacamole Mexicana was awesome. Chimichanga was great.  Loved the salsa... great restaurant."}
{"text":"I just had one of the best filets ever. Try the Filet a la Parilla  We had a great dinner and great service. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Maybe it's the foodgasm talking but HOLY COW! Such amazing service, great ambience, but above all incredible food. I am so full but I can't stop eating(coming from a guy who can never finish half his meal before being full.) I had two bean burritos enchilada style, one red one green, both with distinct but awesome flavor, while my lady had a chicken fajita. I ate all my plate PLUS most of the chicken in her fajitas lol. And the service could not be more accommodating and friendly. One of the best dining experiences in a very long time, every aspect of our experience is top notch. Pro tip, get the hot salsa, little cup, huge flavor. Mix it with the salsa and add a little salt and you're in heaven!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! The chips and salsa were great. The salsa was actually spicy. I got carne Asada fajitas that were great! My husband got the shredded beef chimichanga that had great flavor. Their flan was homemade the server was very personable and attentive."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the quality and flavor of food. I tried the chimichangas and they were okay at best. The rice was mushy and flavorless and the beans were mediocre. I also had a margarita that tasted like the store bought mix. I have had significantly better Mexican food at other locations.  It was also very smokey, like there was a fire in the kitchen. Not sure I'd that's normal or not."}
{"text":"Really great food and beautiful atmosphere.  Great for family or romantic dinner.  Food was so good I ate too much."}
{"text":"I have heard good things about this place and was excited when friends of mine suggested we go. My wife and I each ordered a margarita - me the regular and her a virgin mango. Mine was fine. Her's didn't taste like anything mango. But she drank it anyway. I originally asked about a beer - the menu showed a dark, rich looking beer that resembled a stout, but I didn't see any stouts on the menu. The server said that was supposed to be a Modelo Negro. It was nothing like a Modelo Negro. Maybe that should have been a tip.  We ordered the Hot Pork Wild Wings. They looked awesome on the menu - a thick pork \"wing\" coated with sauce and what appeared to be either pineapple or mango and maybe flakes of red pepper. Yum! Let's start with that. When it came it was just hunks of pork in a wing form on a bed of lettuce and a cup of runny ranch. We each ate one and it tasted okay at the time, but as it cooled it was hard and dry. We asked the server where the pineapple was. He said they don't serve it with that, only lettuce and ranch. My wife said but the menu, and showed him the picture. He said he didn't know what that was, but that's not how they make it.  I ordered the 2 enchilada mole, but I also wanted a taco, so I ordered a side taco. It came out on its own plate and it was like a taco plus a side salad - so much lettuce. The chicken mole was good. It was smoother than others I have had, and that was likely due to the inclusion of peanut butter. It was listed on the menu as a peanut warning. I thought it was good, and two was a good size.  Overall, the server was nice, but the menu gives some misleading information (i.e. the beer and the wings). The mole was good, but not phenomenal. The taco was just a regular taco; nothing to get excited about. The place was just okay for me, but didn't live up to the expectations."}
{"text":"I had not previously been to the Fairmont Princess for lodging or dining, although I have been a guest and a big fan of three Fairmont properties in Alberta, Canada. Located just off the Scottsdale Road & 101 exit the property was easy to find. I reserved the Valentine's Dinner based on the menu I saw online. The menu showed a four-course meal of Lobster and Cauliflower Bisque & Scallops, Wild Striped Bass with English Pea Ravioli, Bone-In Cowboy Steak with Maine Lobster Mac & Cheese and a Brussels Sprouts, Bacon Marmalade, then finally Raspberry Lemongrass Cheesecake for $85 per person.   The server was friendly and informative. We began with complimentary chips & salsa and each ordered a margarita (she the Organic Agave Nectar margarita and me the El Pina Diablo, a pineapple~serrano chile infused tequila). The server brought out the first course, which the menu on the table showed as Sopa de Calabaza. It was a roasted butternut squash soup with crispy pork belly, chipotle yogurt crema and a Granny Smith apple. There was a drizzle of chili oil on top. It was good, although I was a little puzzled it was not the lobster bisque. The granny smith apples were small strips at the bottom of the soup and I could not determine what they were - so I had to ask.   The second course arrived and again I had to ask what it was because it wasn't the wild bass and ravioli I was thinking it would be. Instead it was Empanadas de Langosta y Camaron; a pair of small lobster and shrimp empanadas with a black bean puree, chile arbol and a watercress with an oil and vinegar dressing. By this time I was already feeling the food wall fast approaching and realized we had the main course and dessert yet to come. I was glad that being a guy it didn't take long to get ready so I was able to run a couple of miles before preparing for the evening.  Course three prompted the server to ask how we liked our filet cooked. So this must be the bone-in cowboy steak with mac & cheese...no, it was Filete a la Parilla - grilled filet mignon, sweet corn and rajas tamal, crab fondue, roasted mushrooms and an Oaxacan chile demi. Again, another excellent dish, but not what I originally expected. By this time we were both so full that we barely ate this course. We each made a weak attempt at starting on the filete, but neither came close to finishing, and we both left the tamale. We brought them home in a nice looking take-out bag.  Even though we couldn't eat course 3 that was no excuse not to push on to course 4. It was not the raspberry lemongrass cheesecake, but instead an Almond Leche Flan de Fresas, which was an  almond custard with caramelized strawberries and a few strawberries & black berries on the size with a strawberry drizzle. As a gift my girlfriend received a complimentary red rose.  The meal was excellent and my girlfriend said it was the best meal she ever had. She loved the rose, the atmosphere of the restaurant and courtyard. It was chilly so the fireplaces were nice and inviting. The price was a little better than shown on the web site; $75 instead of $85. In researching the Valentine's Day menu it was surprising to see that the menu and cost described in the opening paragraph is what was shown on the restaurant's website  (http://www.scottsdaleprincess.com/var/cdev_base/storage/original/application/bd42c11d30ed3a90e0baaf090772bb6f.pdf), while the $75 and menu that was actually what we received was shown on a different party's web site (http://intheknowhotels.com/valentines-day-ideas-the-fairmont-scottsdale-princess-resort-packages). Typically I would expect the hotel and its restaurant to be a more reliable source. Despite the differences, the meal was perfect, my girlfriend had an excellent time, and we enjoyed our first official Valentine's Day together. I would definitely go back and try some of the other items. They have a good happy hour menu where the El Pine Diablo is $5 rather than the $11.50 tonight, and there is a $10 heirloom tomato salad that caught my eye."}
{"text":"Here doing a show with cowboy and the staff is very friendly. Having drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Overpriced, probably won't be coming back or suggest to other people.   Limited vegetarian options.    The flaming coffee looks like a cool experience, but we don't know how it actually tastes.     When it came down to it, the only reason that we ate here is because it was at the hotel that we were at.  Some of the other reviewers say that the guacamole was the best they've ever had.   That's crazy to me, they must not have had that much guacamole in their lives.... I feel like I've actually guacamole at home that tastes better.  And for $15, their guacamole better be great."}
{"text":"Have just ordered take out from this place. Very fast and competent service.  I don't know about authentic, but maybe this is what madison considers authentic. The dining room is set out like a cafeteria (no booths, high tables) but the patrons do not seem to mind. It looks like they have a banquet room, but no separate bar area (however, there are plenty of patron bottles everywhere so they offer libations). Currently there is a mariachi band serenading patrons. They are very good...maybe that's where the authentic reviews come from."}
{"text":"Wow, best Mexican  food I've had.  You pay the price, but it's worth a trip.  The three tacos de langosta, three ceviches, and seafood chile relleno to start were all excellent.  The guacamole is perfectly done and made at the table.  The main dish I tried was a mexican cioppino...excellent.  The pork shoulder looked great as well.  Another plus, the tequila list is longer than most wine lists."}
{"text":"Soooo good!  I always forget about this place and I SHOULD'NT!  It's tucked  away from the road, next to CVS, but if you really want a treat (or I should say, great Mexican food), GO HERE.  It's fabulous, and great for take-out if you're not in the mood for the whole restaurant experience.  Do not deny yourself!  :)"}
{"text":"Good, authentic food, lots of it.  Cheap, too.  Been there twice now, got to chill outside late night with the mariachi band the first time for Cinco de Mayo while chowing.  They serenaded one of the guys in our group.  Awkward.  Classic.  The second time was for dinner.  The two of us ate for around 15 bucks altogether.  Portions are slightly bigger than what you would expect for the price.  Not the best mexican food I've ever eaten...but good enough for me.  Got to love unlimited homemade nachos and salsa, gets me every time. That alone is worth a star. Sign me up."}
{"text":"Talk about an amazing let down. Yes it's in a nice resort and has a chefs name attached to it, so we thought it's got to be better than your average Mexican place. It's very pretty and the grounds are impeccably manicured but of course it doesn't make the food taste better.  We ordered the Serrano chile infused pineapple margarita. It was a cloyingly sweet drink that possibly had been exposed to an eye dropper full of canned pineapple juice. Where was the Serrano pepper? On a toothpick above the drink as a garnish. I took it off and mashed it up with my straw and finally it added the kick I was craving. We opted for the Guac sampler as we couldn't decide between the bacon or the pomegranate. Surprisingly the bacon was the least favorite as it was lacking a much needed acid like lime juice to give it any kind of interest. The lobster Guac was great bc of the other ingredients. And the pomegranate was like nothing we have ever tasted! The flavors and textures were layered and complex from the creamy mashed avocado to the crunchy tangy Pom seeds. Well done. Chips were crisp, lightly salted and not too greasy. Tasty on their own. Roasted salsa spicy but very good. Surprisingly we were getting full. I ordered the Seafood Ceviche thinking it would be a light fresh citrusy lo-carb finish. My husband got the tempura branzino fish. Upscale Mexican cuisine is usually a lot of fresh fish and seafood with garlic or lime. I was surprised to see a lot of fried entrees accompanied by cabbage slaws and creamy sauces masking everything. Do an enchilada, but serve it deconstructed. Or use some unexpected ingredients. Elevate the dish. I think we ordered wrong. The portions were too big and the presentation was sloppy like a garbage dump on the plate. Pursue quality, not quantity. Be better than the Cheesecake Factory.  I think the photos speak for themselves. I forgot to capture the fish. I will say that the ceviche was better off the Fairmont poolside menu. What I got was a disaster. A pile of cold mashed sweet potato with no seasoning reminiscent of what might be served in a nursing home to stroke victims who can't swallow. A pile of tiny cooked bay shrimp was dumped on top. They also were not cured in citrus juice with fresh herbs and spices, but were just boiled in water, chilled and dumped on top like your grocery store salad bar. So I was confused (with good reason) as to why the name of this dish would be listed as 'seafood ceviche' as opposed to \"Assisted Living Shrimp.\" I did find two microscopic shreds of crab among the legion of sea monkey shrimp. Around the plate perimeter was a moat of sweet coconut zabaglione-style cream that was better suited for dessert than a complement to shrimp. They need to take this dish off the menu. It's disgusting. This alone will keep me from ever going back. I had high hopes for La Hacienda but they fell short. If you are considering dining at La Horrenda let me suggest you go anywhere but here, unless mediocrity is your standard."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was strange. We called to get a reservation and at 6:30, they said the soonest they had open was 8:15. We tried to clarify if they had ANYTHING sooner, answer was no. Fine, ok, we thought we'd just have drinks at the bar until then. We got there and sat at the bar, and realized the restaurant had only an 1/8th of the tables filled. I assumed the tables were all reserved and that was why we couldn't sit. The hostess could have let us know we were welcome to eat at the bar tables. We were sat at 8:15 by the bartender, as it was obvious there was plenty of room, which was still empty by then. It was just a really strange experience to have such an empty restaurant have people sitting at the bar wanting to eat, but not sitting anyone (the people beside us were also waiting for a table). The restaurant still had over half, maybe 3/4 of the tables empty when we left. Maybe this was an isolated thing, but it was so uncomfortable I have unpleasant memories."}
{"text":"First time here and had a great experience. Friendly and attentive staff. Thomas gave a great recommendation for my meal which I really enjoyed. We were there for happy hour 3-6 with $4.50 house margs (good size too)! I would go back the next time I visit AZ"}
{"text":"This year for Christmas we didn't get each other gifts, we went out on a Christmas experience date night. For our first Christmas adventure we went to the Scottsdale Princess resort. They put up a big Christmas thing featuring lights, a train, Smores, ice skating, a huge tree, and lights synced to music."}
{"text":"Firstly, their salsa isn't good at all.  We eat at a lot of Mexican restaurants and have had a lot of excellent and some not so good salsa.  I'd consider La Hacienda's a 1 on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being excellent.  It looks like they coarsely chop tomatoes, cilantro, onions and some peppers, soak them in water and scoop it into a salsa bowl.  It is gross.  I drink water when we go out.  I drink a lot of water.  There are times, especially when eating spicy food, when I go through 5 glasses of water.  I waited over 15 minutes to get my water refilled.  I actually drank my wife's water after about 10 minutes and then 5 minutes later, I got up to ask our waiter to fill our water glasses.  To my dismay, he was eating his food at a table behind the cash registers, in plain view of customers.  I asked him if we could get our water refilled and he said, \"Sure.\"  He wiped his fingers off on his napkin, came over and grabbed our glasses and refilled them.  WASH YOUR HANDS!  Wow...The nerve of that waiter.  To eat your food, wipe your fingers off on a napkin, then grab something I am going to touch.  Needless to say, this was my 2nd bad experience at La Hacienda.  I wanted to like it, but that won't be possible.  Fool me once, Shame on La Hacienda.  Fool me twice... Well, they won't get a 3rd chance."}
{"text":"Very friendly service, went in at 8:45, 15 mins before close on labor day Monday. It wasn't packed for a holiday which was nice. We were placed in a cozy room. The menu options were excellent. The food was 100%  authentic.  We couldn't get enough of it,  I would recommend any of it. Had the mahi mahi ceviche, huarache de rez, enchiladas divorciadas, i don't remember the name of my husband's dish but it was steak and a nopales salad, tres leches cake, and a cafe. The cafe i would highly recommend if you plan to have a good time :) we went in with high expectations and must say it went beyond."}
{"text":"My go to place for late night dinner, and never disappoint every single time.  My go to meal is the parillada combination (assortment of bbq meat) and horchata. I have to admit the horchata is one of the best I have tasted. It does not have a lot of cinnamon, and stronger milk taste. Caution that it might be too sweet for most people, and you might have to dilute it with water a little bit (it will still be good!)  This place is simply amazing, and I do not think a lengthy review would serve it justice."}
{"text":"Incredibly overpriced for mediocre Mexican food. Ambiance is nice, especially at Christmas time. Check out the menu it's fairly basic Mexican with a bit of a culinary twist but very over priced."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place, especially after all the amazing reviews. The food was cold, no taste, and soupy. The chips were stale. The waiter didn't bother to check wit us, especially after getting our food. We barley got refills for our waters. He didn't check to see how our food was, which was AWFUL!   We waited a while to order and to even get a check.    Save yourselves time and go else where!"}
{"text":"Came to La Hacienda for Arizona Restaurant Week 2010 and loved every part of my experience. From driving up to the friendly complimentary valet, to walking the grounds, being greeted by the friendly hostess, to making friends with one of the waitresses, to the food...everything was nice.   First of all, The Princess hotel is gorgeous. What an amazing venue. It's a little private getaway from the hectic city of Scottsdale. I would love to spend more time at the hotel trying out all of the restaurants and enjoying a spa day. What a great location this would be for a wedding!   I agree about the tortilla chips and salsa being mediocre. I've had better elsewhere. But the appetizer of Ahi Tuna Tostadas made up for it. It was the perfect size of 3 little tostadas with tons of onions and tempura avocado.   Based on the waiters recommendation, I chose the scallops over the vegetarian option and I'm glad I did! The scallops were moist and delicate. Just the way scallops are supposed to be. They were cooked to perfection. My friend ordered the quail and couldn't stop raving about how good it was.   For dessert, we shared the churros and chocolate tort. The churros were fantastic! The chocolate tort was good too, but not compared to the churros. O my gosh. They were warm inside and came with 3 dipping sauces...yummy!   I would recommend La Hacienda for any special occasion. This would also be a great restaurant to take out-of-towners to. I believe they have happy hour, as well."}
{"text":"I have a dilemma with spicy food. On one hand, spice can amplify the flavor of a dish and turn an ordinary meal into an almost religious -and sweaty- experience. On another, after eating spicy food, I usually go through three phases of discomfort: 1) sitting on a couch writhing in pain while desperately scarfing down Tums (and ignoring the recommended dosage); 2) crying on the toilet; and 3) passing out on a bed from the agony experienced from phases 1 and 2. Each time I go through these three phases the discomfort becomes progressively worse (perhaps due to age), however, somehow, my belly seems to always tell my brain not to worry.   I haven't been to La Hacienda since my undergraduate days at UW-Madison, and I'm sad to read below that the quality has gotten worse. In the past, if I rolled with a hungry and rowdy crew, I could always depend a La Hacienda to fill our bellies with delicious and spicy food.  Well after several years, I made my return to this restaurant while visiting some close friends in Madison (shout out to Soupy and Monica). To celebrate the occasion, we ordered horchata and asked the waitress what was her favorite dish. She gushed about the \"parilladas\" (which is most likely the incorrect spelling), which has an assortment of spicy or non-spicy meats (chicken, beef, and pork) grilled on a metal plate cooked above a flame. The meats are eaten with either corn or flour tortillas. For our meal, we made half of the dish spicy and ordered both types of tortillas.   I have to say, this was probably one of the most memorable Mexican meals I have ever eaten. The spicy meats were full of flavor -although I can't say the same with the non-spicy meats- and I loved both types of tortillas. I couldn't stop my inner carnivore from eating this crack meat, despite knowing that my night would eventually end in doom. Even though the cinnamon and banana flavored horchata quelled some of the heat, it could not put stop my inevitable fall into spicy hell.  La Hacienda's parilladas and horchata were both amazing and it made me relive some great memories I've had here in the past. At the end of the night, of course, I went through the three phases of discomfort which quickly ended my night. When I woke up the next morning, I proceeded to eat the left overs. So worth it."}
{"text":"Worst 'dining experience' I think I've ever had!  Begged three times for our drinks (and the food is salty!) before she finally brought it.  Asked a couple times for extra chips that finally came when we were leaving - but the salsa is what we were really hoping for - and it never came at all.  BUT the ultimate worse part?  We ordered this meat platter that comes on an open flame to the table - and ALL our food BURNED UP - I'm talking stinky smokey fire - right before our eyes!!  After waiting for several minutes around a bonfire of our dinner, the dumb waitress finally comes by and asks if we want to box up the stinky burned mess!!  WOW - THE WORST dining experience I've ever had!  And after all this, no tip (of course), and no reimbursement offered."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and staff here, plus the interior is comfortable and cheery. Only thing stopping it from being five stars is the service is a little slow and takes awhile for the food to come out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food and a very large menu to choose from.  I wish I could eat here more often, but it is quite expensive for Mexican food so we don't go that often.  They also don't give unlimited free refills on soda which my husband hates."}
{"text":"Where can I start, Wife and I went for our anniversary. The place is very nice put together. Staff was AWSOME food was different. In the way it was cooked and put together on the plate. Very good place We will definitely go back again for sure thank you for your. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I liked the location, outdoors is really good.  Prefect for romantic dinner ! Definitely this place if you like  guacamole,  instant made in a traditional way."}
{"text":"Revisit 7/27/2013: Unfortunately they have somewhat altered the menu and some of the more innovative (and better) dishes are gone.  The preparation also seems to have suffered.  Perhaps it is just a summer thing.  I hope so.  But I had to take a star away.  Original Review: La Hacienda is not your typical Mexican restaurant -- the menu is very upscale, the prices are high, and the ambiance is that of fine dining.  If you want chicken enchiladas, cheap magueritas, and chips and salsa, there are many other places you can eat.    If you go to La Hacienda, you should be expecting a fine dining experience with Mexican-influenced food.  An example is the Chili Nagano appetizer, which is a spectacular rendition of a southern Mexican staple, blending the flavors of a slightly hot chili pepper with cheese, fruit, tomato, and chicken without any one being overwhelming.  Not all of the food is as good.  The short ribs are great, the slow roasted pork is sometimes a bit dry.  The house marguerita is very good, but the pork belly tacos suffer from an overly-strong salsa.  You get the idea.  How come the five stars, then?  Because even the misses are pretty good and would rate four stars on their own, but the rest of the food, the ambiance, the beautiful setting, and the top notch service make this a five star experience.  It also comes at a five star price.  Locals: you can save about $25 if you have the Preferred Dining card."}
{"text":"I would have given this restaurant five stars. However, their beans have lard in them & they don't offer a vegetarian option. With this day & age, a huge percentage of people prefer either a healthy or vegetarian option &, thus, it's in a restaurant's best interest to offer this-especially an upscale one. Hence, it was disgusting to taste the flavor of fat/lard in the beans in their lobster tacos, which would have been fantastic had there been no lard. Additionally, they have a lovely, warm, soft, doughy churro dessert with warm dipping sauces in edible chocolate dishes. Great idea & delicious aside from the caramel dipping sauce, which in my opinion is terrible & ruined with a tangy goat milk as an ingredient. They should stick with more subtle tasting cow's milk & then that dessert would be fabulous. Pomegranate mojitos & fresh guacamole are great. The scallop dish is wonderful, though far too small & limited for price-especially if one does not eat red meat (comes with pork). Very dark setting. I suggest bringing a flashlight or cell with flashlight app in order to be able to read the menu. They should set silverware on napkins for cleanliness, rather than directly on table. Otherwise, good food, good service, & nice setting."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4.5 stars... really enjoyed it! My boyfriend and I visited for AZ restaurant week, right away the old world spanish decor was lovely, I loved the table in the little room we were sat in, one side of the table had this nice big, lush bench seat with a pillow- nice and relaxing. Our waiter seemed a little weird, but he did his job and gave us a laugh!  The food was wonderful, we got the ahi tuna and empanada appetizers, both were delish! Then we got the quail and pork tenderloin w/ chorizo entree's, sooooo good! Loved both of them, full of flavor and creativity! Dessert was also really good, we had the chocolate torte and the churro's w/ 3 sauces, both were a delightful end to the meal, rich and tasty! We also had their flaming coffee with dessert, we got the one with kahlua, not sure what it was called exactly, but it was a fun show! We definitely plan to go back, great experience all around!"}
{"text":"I may pour over the menu but I always just get the burrito vegetariano with avocado and I am never disappointed.  Great, simple, reasonably priced Mexican food. This is an EXCELLENT place for groups!"}
{"text":"Food and service is always on point. The atmosphere is great. The only thing that would be great if they had a tv to watch."}
{"text":"This restaurant is situated on the grounds of the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, the hotel in which we were staying at. We didn't feel like driving anywhere so my 2 kids & I decided to try it out. The restaurant was nice but had really dim lighting. We started off with the Esquites guacamole and that was delicious. It was a combination of guacamole with elote corn & we gobbled that up. We then shared the barbacoa & carnitas tacos, but we were really disappointed. I love my food flavorful & well seasoned but this was a little too salty for me. We finished off with the churros which came with 3 dipping sauces. Yes, the churros were soft but nothing special. I guess for the higher prices, I expected the food to wow us. However, we only enjoyed the guacamole appetizer. The food alone I would rate a 3.5 but their service was pretty exceptional so I bumped it up to a 4."}
{"text":"Always saw signs for this restaurant, and decided to give it a try.  I will say that La Hacienda is a little hard to find, as it is apart of a mall. I thought the food was pretty good.  They had the best salsa of any Mexican place I've ever eaten at.  However, I think it was a little pricey.  I'm not sure if it's because they are hidden and they don't get much traffic so have to make up for it?  The service was friendly and prompt...I wish there was more restaurants like this in the South Hills.  I would go back."}
{"text":"La Hacienda (515 S Park Street, Madison, WI 53715) is an excellent Mexican restaurant.  In my opinion the most authentic Mexican food.  Actually owned and runner by a Mexican who values authenticity.  If you like Mexican food this is the place to go.  The food is always fresh and we'll presented.  The menu selection of Mexican food is impressive and very tasty at both lunch and dinner...everything you could want including greats Margaritas, shakes, and nice selection of beers and soft drinks.   The restaurant is very clean with excellent lighting and a good number of tables to select from.  The staff are very friendly and are very attentive to customer needs.  The price is fantastic and they give you a lot of food at both lunch and dinner.  Chips and salsa are free/included with your meals.  They have lunch specials so check their web page or call them.     Try this place and you will be a regular.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with family and friends. Two of us ordered Steak fajitas and another person ordered a Beef dish.  All of our meats were so tough that we kept on chewing as if it was cardboard.  Has to be the worst steak I've ever had!  Tougher and so chewy that our jaws were hurting and at the end we would just give up by spitting it out.  We let the waitress know and she said that she would inform the kitchen.  Even though our dishes were not even half way eaten, we were charged for our dishes and not offered an alternative.  Been their many times and it's getting worse and worse each time.  We have celebrated many holiday dinners there but this will be my last visit there!"}
{"text":"it is awesome.  they make a pork burrito that can kill you with all the pork they put in there.  they give you chips and salsa for coming in.  they have this coconut rice milk drink thing that is wonderful.  i usually like to read a paper at lunch, and they don't have any in english, but other than that, the pork will deliver."}
{"text":"Needed a restaurant close to St. Mary's hospital so chose to go to La Hacienda. We ordered the following    Grande Burrito with ground beef, fajitas,and chimichangas. No sauce or cheese or chimichangas or burrito. Meat was over cooked so very dry. Fajitas were very greasy, to the point that I was nauseous for nearly 2 hours after eating.  Perhaps some things are worth ordering, but it isn't the items we ordered."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I celebrated our 2 year anniversary here. We ordered an el pina Diablo and guavapolitan as our drinks and the chorizo empanadas to start off with. We were already in food and drink heaven when our halibut and filet came out for our main course. We usually talk a lot when we eat, so when we don't speak at all it means the food is amazing. We were the last people in the restaurant when our complimentary desserts came out with a happy anniversary message. La Hacienda went above and beyond our expectations. We can't wait to come again!! I recommend this restaurant to anyone that loves good food and drinks."}
{"text":"Awesome service from the second we came in.  The salsa had a good little kick to it. We got the guacamole and they made it fresh in the back. It was a giant serving and super delicious!!  The lady got pork Pibil tacos so I got to try a little and it was tasty albeit a little dry (though I'm sure the pina salsa they had on it helped out with that.) I got a combo with a shredded beef enchilada, a chicken tamale, and a ground beef taco which came with rice and received beans. The least favorite part for me was the tamale (it was a little dry) but all in all I was really impressed with this place! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Loved the Seafood Enchiladas, and the Snakebite tequila shot is an actual experience, great service, will be back!"}
{"text":"Clean store, friendly and accommodating service and huge menu! A lot of great Mexican choices, including seafood specialties like fish tacos and ceviche. They started me off with complimentary chips and salsa. Made in house and tasty. For my entree, I ordered two chicken enchilada (red sauce) with rice and beans. The sauce and protein options for the enchiladas are vast. My meal was very disappointing. I must've come on a bad day because this place has 4 stars. The enchilada sauce was too watery that the sauce came off of the tortillas. The beans were very bland. Canned refried beans are better than what I was served. I enjoyed the free chips and salsa more than my entree. 2 stars for food and 4 stars for customer service and ambience."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? My dad and I got an Uber from our hotel and we could not find the La Hacienda. I called La Hacienda and asked them for directions and the girl acted like I was stupid. We ran into a security guard in a booth and he tried to give us directions. We went through security gates and still could not find La Hacienda. We drove around parking lots, side streets, behind buildings, etc. and still could not find it. We ended up going back to our hotel.  I researched this more and found out that the La Hacienda is in a resort and the address listed on their website as well as YELP is for the resort and not the actual restaurant so Google Maps only got us close to the restaurant but NOT to the actual restaurant.  If this was my business I would make darn sure the address listed on Yelp & my website was accurate so that people using Google maps could find it. - DUH!!!"}
{"text":"I went here tonight with my friends/coworkers and while we did come mainly for margaritas, we were also hungry so decided to order food initially. Our server was new and not at all knowledgeable about the food (yet didn't pretend to be either). Our drinks were delicious, but that was it. The complimentary salsa had a decent flavor, but was very watery. I ordered a simple burrito with avocado which was not bad but nothing to write home about either. My boss ordered tamales which she said were very dry and chile rellenos which I tried a little bit and they were just drenched in oil causing it to be very soggy and you could tell that the oil had not been changed in awhile. She was not too happy. There seemed to be a lot of employees yet service was very slow.  I may return since they are open very late, but I will probably only get simple things like drinks and chips with guacamole."}
{"text":"They say they have outdoor seating, but they don't. Patio was fully enclosed like a large brick 3 season porch. Playing loud dance music the whole time, which didn't fit with the family atmosphere. Food was a good value and service was decent."}
{"text":"I was sick!  I came home with leftovers!  I would do this again and again!  This was the best!  I was told to come here from a friend and man was it the right choice!  The food was outstanding.  The only complaint is I only had one sitting.  The Suckling pork was great, but funny enough not the best.  The four of us had ordered apps, salads and soups and main courses, and had to stop on each serving to take it home, and we still had more to take home when all was said and done.  The spinach salad was to die for and I will be trying to make that at home.  The fish was cooked perfectly, the steak was cooked perfectly and the service was fantastic!  In fact, I read reviews before I left expecting less and got way more!  This morning we are making Suckling Pork omelets and for lunch, making steak sandwiches.  If you read anything about this place that is negative, then try it again - again, you can B*&^h, about places all day long, but really - good food is subjective, but well crafted food is unusual.  This placed - more so for a hotel restaurant, deserves a 5 star rating.    As for being a personal Zagat or Berlitz reviewer, people take Yelp way to serious on all the details.  Sure - you can find this or that to complain about and knock a star or three off, but in the end, honestly try to read reviews with a grain of salt and get out and try new places.  We do and wow - we loved it!  Again - enjoy your time here and make this one of the stops you go to."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. Authentic, spacious, friendly, good food, open until very late."}
{"text":"Everywhere I go, I try to get the cochinita pibil.  This is the best I've had, since the now-closed \"Fonda del Mar\" in Chicago.  It has a bit of a kick thanks to the habanero.  I don't know if I'd go back just for that restaurant, but if I was in the area, I'd definitely pay them a visit."}
{"text":"Good. Super expensive   The food here is exceptionally good. It's Mexican and although I don't think it's worth what they charge $29 for enchiladas, $15 for guacamole) it's very good.   I wouldn't go back but it certainly was good.  The service was pretty average. Scenery was great."}
{"text":"No Churros For You!!  Very disappointed, we had reservations for New Year's Eve. Received a phone call at 3:30 the day of to confirm reservation and the pre set menu @$75.00 per person....very limited menu. We should have been told about the limited menu when scheduling. Very poor show of what they normally offer. ... Left us w/out another option  at 3:30 on the eve Ceviche was \"ok\" we were an \"early\" seating, probably better later in the evening when it had more time to marinate. Quesadilla option was lukewarm. Beet salad was good, not sure how it worked with the rest of the menu. No guac trio or lobster tacos, which they are known for!!! Pork entree was fabulous, filet was well seasoned, not sure why they paired with a seafood enchilada (no one at our table ate more than one bite of the enchilada) Dessert was typical of a conference dinner... Server was friendly, he did his best... The guy with the mohawk and tattoos is still the best server we've ever had there. We always say New Year's is for amateurs, you bet we will be staying home next year!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the food and the service. The ambiance is OK. I do not like the tables and how open everything is. This place is good for larger groups because it's easy to push tables together but for a date, there's not a lot of privacy.. Food is reasonably priced and I've always gotten very friendly service. The salsa is OK; I've had better, but I shouldn't complain  when it's free! Last time we went, I had the chicken chimichanga and my boyfriend had the fajitas. Both were amazing."}
{"text":"Very Nice Hotel...Parking a lillte confusing but we used Valet ( its free! just tip the guys!) We went on a tuesday night it was very quiet... we tried almost everything. The queso fundido con Chorizo so good! Not to greasy I was surprise... the shrimp tacos were Delicious and the braised beef very nice and tender, it could use some more sauce thought! The flame coffee it was a must! after seeing it in almost every table but I wasn't impress :( To much cinnamon and the flavor its not that great... nice show though! I'll come back..."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Mexican I have ever had. I couldn't breath I was so full when I walked out. We started w traditional guacamole w salsa and split the Maine lobster tacos and bone in short rib. Omg on both- esp the lobster tacos.  The margaritas were amazing too- I got a spicy pineapple serano and a top shelf. Yummy"}
{"text":"We just found our favorite New Mexican food. I had the flautas and they where amazing. We will be coming back here for sure. Everything is new inside and booths are super comfortable. The service was great also. My husband had the flank steak and it was also amazing. I will mention that the food is not over spicy but that's how I like it I am sure if you requested it hot they would accommodate  you. Don't forget to have the flan for dessert it is delicious!!"}
{"text":"The best Carnitas in Arizona. Our server Ray was hospitable, polite, gave suggestions and his menu knowledge was good. He suggested the prickly pear Margarita and it was fabulous.  The restaurant decor was  creative and clean."}
{"text":"Exquisite food and service. However, be prepared to spend some money. Lovely setting along with prompt courteous service made for a delightful evening. Table side guacamole, while delicious will set you back $ 15 - Don't bother with the shrimp ceviche...as there was not enough shrimp yet it costs $ 16. My favorite appetizer dish was the lobster tacos bursting with flavor..."}
{"text":"Gotta try the lobster guac. We also had the Elite Tequila Flight. There are over 200 tequilas to try and staff was very knowledgable. Awesome ambiance as well."}
{"text":"Ridiculously small portions for ridiculously high prices.  This is MEXICAN FOOD for gods sake!!!!  Do they realize how many knock-you-socks-off authentic Mexican food restaurants there are in the southwest???!!!!??  For a portion of the price!!!!  The pretty setting is a plus, but not THAT MUCH!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  Definitely pricey since it's in the Fairmont Princess hotel.  Great setting and ambience.  Our waiter was great.  The way he described half the menu made me want to eat half the menu.    I decided on the carnitas plate.  It wasn't the typical carnitas plate of shredding carnitas, it was a ball of carnitas.  Very tasty and a good portion.  We also had the enchilads mariscos and we were a fan of them too.  I ordered a tequila flight.  It's great to taste the 3 tequilas, but definitely overpriced for the tiny bit of tequila you get in each glass.  I probably would have given it a 5 star rating if there was a little more tequila in the glasses.  The drinks are very expensive ($14-$17 for a margarita), but once again, we are at the Fairmont Pricess and the prices are expected to be a little more than normal.  Overall, I would come back on a special occasion."}
{"text":"BIRTHDAY AT THE PRINCESS!!!!!  Chip and salsa!!! Keep it coming. Oh.my.gosh. The tortilla chips were thick and so crisp. The salsa would of have been spectacular if it was hot.  Very casual.. good vibe, the decor was western like.   Entrée ;:The Chicken fajita was really good says the boyfriend. And i got the vegetarian enchiladas. It was very salty.. :( I rather have the chip and salsa as my entrée.  :/ i hate to do this..but here it goes ... our waitress was so slow. Took her forever to get the water, paper napkins. And the bill.  My birthday desert was really good. :) mmmmm fruit empanadas."}
{"text":"I always am a huge fan of this place. As a student it was a regular spot for us to stop after games because it was guaranteed to have seats. It also makes great drunk food but odds are you will need a cab or a designated driver because it's a hike from most bars.   I'm a huge fan of the fajitas. You get that sizzling platter of meats, peppers, and onions. I don't advise the fish it just is mediocre. But the steak and chicken is great. With their homemade guac and pico you will never be fuller.   Oh and don't forget the margaritas. They have a variety of sizes but let's be real you need the one that's the size of your head. I suggest the strawberry but I haven't had the lime so I am sure that's great too!"}
{"text":"Very friendly, fast service! We've been here four times and every time the food has been excellent! A hidden gem in Chandler."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food and kind, attentive service. This is our second time here and we adore La Hacienda! The margaritas are generous and high quality - a rarity to find a restaurant with good margaritas that don't skimp on the tequila. We have ordered chicken soft corn tacos, chicken mole enchilada carne asada fajita and skirt steak, and we have enjoyed all of them.   This is the best spot for Mexican food in the east valley. We will be returning...again and again!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food.  I have been here several times and have not been disappointed once.  Each time has been with great service and bold flavors.   Even though the parking needs a little work (limited), there is plenty of seating....FREE CHIPS AND SALSA !!!!   I have not done dinner here, but I have had lunch several times.   I take advantage of the Lunch menu.  Awesome values, great portions, and there quick.   I have not had a bad meal yet.  I am currently working my way down it.  I am on item 12."}
{"text":"I am not sure where all the great reviews came from here? This was totally microwave Mexican food. The waiter had the personality of a toad. He did not even ask what size of beer we wanted and brought the 22oz Grande for $7.50 instead of the 16oz for $4.00 that we thought we ordered......  Then I ordered a hard and soft taco, these tacos were not even close to the ones you get so cheap at Del Taco. They were dripping with oils and no flavor.....  So much for authentic Mexican! We just returned this month from Cabo and this is not 'authentic' by no means....  We will not be back.....the bill was $40 with tip w/beers at $14.50 of it.  Save your $4 and go to Del Taco or go try Rio Rico in Gilbert for real authentic family owned Mexican food!  Adios La Hacienda.....not again!"}
{"text":"The molé at this place is some of the best I've had.  The guac is good too.  It's inconvenient for locals that the restaurant is at a resort, but it's a great place to visit. If you eat at the restaurant around Christmas or the 4th of July, you get great perks such as free valet and wristbands (which normally cost around $60, I think) to attend on-property concerts and great activities for kids."}
{"text":"The molcajete lunch special is packed with flavor and a lot of food for $11! It comes with a side of rice, beans, guacamole, and sour cream. If you're a pork fanatic like me, you can't go wrong with the salsa verde plate! Very delicious and just the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"This is the only place I found in this area  (visiting from California) that served my favorite: Chili Colorado... 1st time ordered to go, 2nd time dined here.  Best to dine in.  Much better experience!   Restaurant itself, intimate. Staff, friendly. Margaritas, excellent.  Try the jalapeño margarita, you'll feel the burn! Music, eclectic.  Mexican country, pop, rock, jazz...should be a SIRIUS channel! Note... I don't speak Spanish! Food, well, I finished it all!  Very satisfying!"}
{"text":"Two words: lobster tacos. Simply the best, flavorful, rich and spicy tacos ever. The margaritas are okay but you need to come here for the tacos. Also, customer service is superb!"}
{"text":"For my boyfriend's birthday I wanted to find a great restaurant in Scottsdale that he hadn't been to, and that's nearly impossible. He loves Mexican and this was voted #1 in AZ. So I called a couple of weeks in advance for reservations and the chef said he would create a special coconut rum cake for the occasion (not a normal menu item). It was really wonderful tasting and the birthday boy was pleasantly surprised to see his favorite cake with beautiful decor and writing on it.   We started at the tequila bar before dinner; La Hacienda has more than 200 tequila varieties so Evan had a margarita with a suggested tequila which was really smooth. I had the watermelon margarita off the menu which I also loved. We ordered the table side guacamole which rivaled the best guac I have tried, with fresh chips and salsa that is just the perfect amount of heat. Wow, this place sure does know their stuff. They also have a sampling of all 5 of their guacs which we will have to come back and try.  We were seated at our table and our guac was relocated for us, so we moved onto dinner. The Costilla des Res (beef short rib) entree and the crab enchiladas were both extraordinary. The Costilla you didn't even have to cut and they had a sweet glaze. The crab enchiladas were hearty and just as tasty.  To accompany the surprise cake we shared the flaming coffee which is literally a flaming tableside show with 1921 (Mexican spirit), coffee and lots of cinnamon; topped off with homemade whipped cream and chocolate shavings. I actually HATE hot alcohol but this was the first time I have been able to drink one. You couldn't taste a trace of alcohol.   Including the custom cake, total bill between the bar and meal was $185 after tax and tip. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Okay.... been wanting to come here so we came thru.   Walked in, place was very hot and no air circulating.  Asked about the AC, owners mentioned it was checked recently but maybe it wasn't fixed correctly.  With so many people it was very uncomfortable.  Asked for water, that took forever.   Beer arrived around the same time.   Service was very slow, they said they hadn't expected so many people.  When we asked for more chips, \" sorry, we don't enough chips to give out more.\"  Food came out, was pretty tasty but waited for tortillas on an order.  Checked on very seldom, drinks ran dry.  We ended up outside to help cool off, waited a long time for drinks as well.  When we got our beer we were short two waters.  Waiter said, \"sorry, we don't have enough glasses to give water.\"    Not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"Located on the Fairmont Princess propriety, this Mexican food restaurant has great ambiance with outdoor seating and heat lamps and an expansive, dimly-lit dining room. Our family party of ten was seated at a high table inside in an area that could be closed off behind a curtain. The service was prompt and our server offered popular recommendations. One bowl of $16 guacamole, ground with a mortar and pestle tableside, was enough for the whole table to share. Prices are awfully high for main entrees; fajitas, enchiladas, and taco dishes run between $26-$32 and are priced a la cart. A side of rice and beans is an additional $6 for an individual serving (!!). While the presentation was compartmentalized and pretty, the main dishes were just ok. The fajitas came with 6 pieces of jumbo shrimp, tail on, or sliced steak or chicken on an individual skillet with 3 tortillas rolled up in a cloth dinner napkin. The enchilada sauce is plentiful, but the rolled tortillas are small with a smidge if chicken. However, the $12 churros for dessert are a must-have. The dipping sauces come in edible chocolate cups. Overall, we had a nice meal, but you might have a different review if you try the margaritas or tequila!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday tonight and everything was amazing! Nelson was our server and he was so polite and professional. Food was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this place not only for the great service but also for the yummy food! Thank you so much for making my birthday dinner the best!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were part of a large group from a conference and this restaurant was on the same property as the hotel. The service was fantastic, (thanks Angel) but the food left a lot to be desired. Fancy dishes that was above the skill set of the kitchen. The  fish was way over cooked to the point we're I felt sorry for the fish. Besides cleaning the tarter off my teeth, it was a waste of a excellent cut of fish."}
{"text":"This is continued from my post about the Princess Hotel. So we walked over to La Hacienda after having a few drinks at Stone Rose. We walked in, spoke to the host and told her we do not have any reservations. She went on to say \"we are fully committed for the evening\" I looked around and saw 3 tables seated. She said \"they should be arriving withing the next 15 -30 minutes. We decided to go ahead and sit at the bar and have dinner since there was room and the food had been very good previous times. Bartenders were great, and they have a server there who is incredibly knowledgeable about tequila who was very helpful as well. We ordered appetizers (Queso Fundido) and chips and Salsa. we could have been content with that but after a few \"sol\" beers and a tequila shot, we decided to order dinner. I went with the tampiquena (skirt steak) and my girlfriend had the mole poblano (chicken entree)  They both were great and we continued to watch the restaurant and see if guests started to pack in for all the reservations.  They did have a group of 12 from the WM company who came in. but that was about it. I few more 4 tops who did not have reservations who sat in the lobby/bar area. After a filling dinner on the way out, I asked if they were still fully committed for the evening? She said \" Didnt you see that huge party we sat?\" I was like, yes that party of 12? They took up 4 tables.  I understand completely that if they do have reservations they need to have room for them but they were turning away people who did not have reservations and we sat at the bar. I know $200 in the grand scheme of things does not mean a whole lot to them, but I will never go into a restaurant, who does not truly care about their business and want to try to find ways to get people in."}
{"text":"La Hacienda looks beautiful inside.  It's dimly lit and full of cushy dining room chairs and big, clean tables.  It's very inviting and with Spanish fare on the menu, the aromas are mouth-watering.  My party included gentlemen who were acquainted with the chef, so we were sent a complimentary serving of every appetizer on the menu!  The table-side (i.e. prepared table-side) guacamole and fresh tortilla chips = outstanding!  Definitely order them if you're in the mood for an appetizer.  There's enough to share among a group of four or so.  We ordered seconds, but there were eight in our party.  Yes, the guacamole does contain onions, but the delicious avocado and other ingredients are so tasty that the onions did not even bother me!  Queso fundido is another appetizer that was popular at our table.  It's a dish that's probably six inches long by three inches wide and 1.5 inches deep filled with a mix of cheeses.  It's served with warm tortillas.  The cheese got cold kind of fast, but that's to be expected.  We had a delightful Pinot Grigio from Argentina with our meal, if you like white wine.  Mmm!  For my main course, I ordered the \"Atun\" which is tuna.  The server asked how I'd like it prepared, and I selected \"rare,\" which was very delicious.  It was a small portion served over mashed potatoes.  My boyfriend ordered the Camarones Enchiladas, which is shrimp enchiladas.  I tasted a shrimp and it was darn good!  The feedback I received from the other diners at our table was all positive.  So why the 3 stars??  The service.  The servers waited until our appetizers were finished before even taking our entree orders.  Not cool!  We didn't get to eat our main course until two hours after arriving at the restaurant.  Also, we were a big party drinking several bottles of wine.  Sadly we had to flag down a server each time we needed a new bottle.  For this class of hotel and subsequently a fine dining restaurant of the same class, I expect excellent service.  I instead received mediocre service.  Hopefully this was just a fluke.  I'll let you know when I make it back to La Hacienda."}
{"text":"Last Christmas we walked by this restaurant and the patio area seemed really nice so we decided to make sure we checked it out sometime. Well tonight was finally that night. Overall the food was excellent and so were the drinks but the highlight of the meal was without a doubt the queso fundito.  Do your yourself a favor and order this dish. It's amazing."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience in dining out at a beautiful resort. Would definatly recommend."}
{"text":"All I can say it's amazing! I am in love with the food,the environment and the service. Ceazer is awesome! Absolutely an awesome experience. A perfect end to my weekend! A must try for sure. Fajitas are delicious and the chips and salsa  yummy! Absolutely made my heart smile. This is the experience people go out to eat for. Absolutely excellent! Phenomenal restaurant. I would give them a million stars if I could. Prices are awesome as well and they have lunch specials."}
{"text":"As for Mexican food...let's just say that I meet my quota.  So I was quite surprised to find that a meal at La Hacienda was my favorite of a recent trip to Scottsdale.  There was not a single aspect of the meal that wasn't outstanding from a food standpoint.  First, I'd recommend starting with their El Diablo spicy margarita -- a pepper-infused beauty that really kicks things off.  The tortilla chips were a perfect delivery vehicle for their salsa -- a nice and spicy chipotle and a more normal, but fantastic, regular salsa.  I had the chipotle shrimp, which was delicious and yet almost outshined by the simple corn base it sat upon.  Others in our party raved about the shortribs.  I closed the meal with inarguably the best flan I've ever had (and I've had my share). This is not a particularly fancy restaurant, but don't skip it if you're here...  One related comment.  I read one review dinging the breakfast buffet here.  I never sampled it, but I do know that it is run separately from the restaurant -- totally different staff, etc. -- so I wouldn't hold a bad breakfast against La Hacienda."}
{"text":"I lived across the street from La Hacienda for two years. I cannot count how many times I ate there. The staff knew me all too well. Great chicken mole enchiladas. Great carne burritos. Great enchiladas rojas de queso. Great sangria. I highly believe this to be the most authentic Mexican spot in Madison...and yes, I have been to Mexico."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place - but I've had two bad experiences here.  Once, I found the service to be incredibly slow and sloppy... for example, waiting 10 minutes for my drink to come out and not remembering to leave dressing on side, etc.   The second experience here the service was bad (completely forgot to bring my drink order to the table) and the food wasn't good.  The empenadas were not that flavorful and I had the Halibut for dinner - but it was SO salty, I literally couldn't even eat it...  not sure if they SPILLED the salt on it, or what, but it was absolutely inedible.   I think it was once a lovely place, but it needs a decor update, food quality update and more attentive service."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The service was insanely terrible.  So bad it almost deserved lower scores. We had a reservation at 645pm for 4. We ordered 2 appetizers 4 cocktails and 3 meals because obviously with 2 appetizers we had a ton of food. Not only did our meal come before appetizers they tried to rush our meal so much we had everything out at once and they were trying to clear our table within 25 minutes.  We never worked with the same server. To boot after far above the average per head ticket they added a $6 charge for \"splitting\" a meal.   With what we spent that was obnoxious.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Service: 5 stars! Best waiter we've had in Phoenix in a while. Also, the happy hour margarita was one of the best I've had in the Valley.  Every person from the valet to the hostess to the guy who drove us back to the valet in a golf cart was incredibly nice.  Ambiance: 5 stars! Wonderful gem of a restaurant. Not too crowded, not over themed. Just right. Elegant without too much pretension.  Food: 4 stars - excellent food, very well prepared, decent sizes, but it didn't blow either of us away.    Price - surprisingly decent for a fancy restaurant with 3 drinks between the two of us.  I wouldn't call it inexpensive or affordable, but I was surprised that we didn't pay much more!  The five star review is mostly for the service. I can't say enough good things about how warmly we were welcomed.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  And for being a hotel restaurant, it gets extra kudos.  I kind of doubt I would ever pick coming here again (just bc it's far from where I live and bc I can get  tasty Mexican food for cheaper elsewhere), but I did enjoy my experience there.  First, decor is AMAZING.  really beautiful place and I love how the tables on the patio have flames shooting up out of the middle. literally! fire coming right up out of your table. So cool!  And they have these cute little glass cloche type things with a succulent landscape inside on each table.  It takes up a lot of table space, but it's so pretty!  I'm even inspired to try to recreate it on my own for my house.  plus the Fairmont in general is just gorgeous.  so for this reason, it's a nice place for a special date night!  Second, food is good!  not out of this world, but I definitely liked my meal.  I ordered the carnitas enchiladas and shared the guacamole sampler for appetizer.  the enchiladas were just what you'd expect, nothing much to comment there.  I really liked the trio of guacamoles we ate!  Tasted very freshly made and had some inventive combinations (like adding pomegranate seeds, neat!)  Third, there is this guy who goes around making hot chocolate.  He puts the chocolate powder mixture in this flaming glass and swishes it around and keeps adding more chocolate powder.  I really don't know how he did not singe his hands bc he wasn't wearing gloves or anything.  It was really neat to watch and it made the entire dining area smell heavenly.  Again, great place for a special date!"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick late night bite. The restaurant has a beautiful modern yet Mexican influence type of ambiance. Very inviting! Started off with the El Piña Diablo! Pineapple and chili infused tequila with fresh sour and pineapple. Spicy yet refreshing! Cocktails are also generous in size so not bad for the price! The bartender strongly agreed with my dinner choice of fish tacos. So glad that's what I ordered! The mahi mahi was fresh and light yet crispy and covered in a delicious slaw with avocado. Portion was quite large and came with an overly tasty side of rice and beans! So happy I stopped here on my last night in Scottsdale! Even if you aren't staying at the Fairmont it is definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Staycation at the Fairmont Princess. Dined in the onsite restaurant. Wonderful food, great environment. Helpful and attentive staff! Large portions, my sister and I split the fajitas and my husband ordered the White Fish dish."}
{"text":"La Hacienda is a simple place.  Nothing fancy, just good food.  I love the authentic tacos and steak torta.  There's probably not much else to this place than that."}
{"text":"Great service and food, very clean and friendly. Mexican pizza was delicious along with the chile con queso.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went to the La Hacienda prior to seeing the Christmas lights at the Princess. We ordered appetizers and glad we all  ordered our own since each appetizer was extremely small. 3 of us ordered the quesadilla con carne asada. it was tasty but did not look like a  quesadilla but rather like very small tacos. My husband got the queso fundido which not traditional either but came in a iron pan of melted cheese  with flour tortilla on the side. Everyone liked what they had, everything was very tasty so no complaints there and good service. The Margaritas were very good and nice size. but...the bill for 5 very small appetizers and 5 drinks was $150.00. I've been to plenty of Mexican restaurants that are just as good for a fraction of the price. I guess you are paying to be at the resort."}
{"text":"I have to say, this is one of the best Mexican food restaurants I've ever been to.  I'm from San Diego so I know good Mexican food. The menu is large. So many options to choose from.  I tried the Pollo Poblano. It was mind blowing. It came out piping hot, steaming. The sauce was creamy and so delicious. The chicken was tender and juicy. The red and green bell peppers crisp.  The sauce complimented the rice well. And who can beat a fishbowl margarita for $8?! Also, the mole sauce on the burrito is so cinammony and has a great kick to it. For those who complain of slow service, you need to learn to slow down in life and enjoy the atmosphere and food here. The waiters are very helpful if you ask for suggestions and they leave you be while you eat so you can actually enjoy your meal. All recipes are family recipes and made to order, no prefab meals.  If you don't like more laid back service,  then go elsewhere. But then you'll miss out on some amazing food."}
{"text":"This  place has it all.  The service was spectacular    Francisco our waiter was attentive and helpful.  The food was amazing.  The portions were large enough to take home for another meal.  I had the carnitas tacos that were truly delicious.  My daughter looks very her chicken fajitas and she's a picky eater.   My husband loved the lobster tacos.  He loves bed then.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Labor Union Edit:  La Hacienda is currently in some deep water regarding their hiring practices.  Back wages haven't been paid, etc...  So for now, they're down to one star as you don't cross a picket line.  Open late with pretty consistent food, La Hacienda is a pretty safe bet.   It's not going to wow you or impress your friend from San Diego, but its close to downtown, the service is friendly, and the prices reasonable.  Try the horchata, a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Service was ok, not keen on empty glasses and having to get up half way through my meal to get that salsa I asked for when my food was served. Wasn't busy so it made it a little more bothersome. I ordered the carne plate...the meat had no flavor and the Tbsp portions of rice & beans were the size of a kids plate. Overall their avg rating of 4.5 is extremely gracious."}
{"text":"The sopa de elote (roasted corn soup) is excellent as are all of the ceviches."}
{"text":"We only went for drinks and appetizers. Pricey and portions were very small but our main complaint was the greasiness of a few of the meat choices, tacos, enchiladas and queso fundido."}
{"text":"Best guac ever made at your table. We sat by the fire, sipping delicious margaritas.  The ceviche is a treat. Service is very good. I had the Costilla de Res and it melted in my mouth.  Prices are a little high but it is worth it."}
{"text":"I love Richard Sandoval restaurants.  Maya and Pampano in NYC are two of my favorites.  So when in AZ I had to try out La Hacienda.  One look at the happy hour menu and I was in love!  The best El Diablo Margarita for $5.00!  Prickly Pear Margarita $5.00.  A whole assortment of tacos $5.00!  Ceviche was awesome.  Guacamole amazing!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food of my life!! We started by doing happy hour, which was very tasty (tacos), but decided we would opt for the dining room full service dinner. The service was superb. Our server (I've forgotten his name! Darn!) was so attentive and just incredible! My husband ordered the blue crab enchiladas. Not something I would ever think to order but they were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I had ordered the steak fajitas but was accidentally served chicken. I told the server I would stick with chicken (as opposed to waiting for a fresh steak to be cooked) and he went overboard to try to rectify the mistake. He brought a free margarita (also delicious - very talented mixologists!), and a complimentary dessert - the homemade churros with assorted dipping sauces! I DIE! If I could live in those dipping sauces and swim around my life would be complete! Everything was incredible! My only regret is that we were staying on site in a room with no mini-fridge, so no way to take leftovers. We were stuffed and couldn't finish everything and it pains me that the deliciousness was wasted by being thrown away because I would eat those leftovers EVERY DAY if I could. So, so good! My main advice would be to go ahead and sit in the dining room. I know they're known for their happy hour (which is also good), but the full dinner is leaps and bounds above what I'd ever expected. And being from Texas and Arizona, I'm a bit of a Mexican food connoisseur so I know what I'm talking about! ; ) Also - get the churros. For the love of all things holy. Get 2 orders, just to be safe."}
{"text":"The guacamoles were heavenly.  I dream of visiting Scottsdale again just to order the guacamoles.  They have one of the largest tequila menus in the area - in fact they have a tequila sommelier.  The main course dishes are not laudable; some are a little too rushed and lack value.  But the guacamoles take you for a whimsical taste adventure.  [insert heart emoji]"}
{"text":"I have only come to La Hacienda with large groups of work teammates and the good news about that is we came once 4 years ago, enjoyed the meal enough that it has led to us going back every year when we meet again in Scottsdale.  Serving big groups can be a challenge but they have always come through with our last visit in February being the biggest hurdle given we had a reservation for 12 and then 4 more showed up late and wanted in.  The staff adjusted well, was graceful about it and took care of seating and  helped the latecomers get drinks and apps so they could catch up.  All I know about the food is that I've tried a number of dishes over the years and been fully satisfied with them all.  In terms of the guacamole, I've enjoyed the original, pear and pomegranate and crab varieties.  For entrees, I think my two favorite are the Pollo En Mole Poblano and the Carnitas.  End of the day Richard Sandoval knows his stuff and has put together an excellent restaurant that is set in a very pretty Fairmont hotel property."}
{"text":"This is great exciting restaurant offering Hand Crafted Margaritas, wines, and great food.   In my opinion this is the best , most exciting restaurant in entire Phoenix, Scottsdale area.  My three guests agreed with me.   Our group of four started with their Hand crafted Margaritas.  I had their La HACIENDA with reposada tequila, cointreau, grand marnier, sour.  It is the one I like best.  Next time I will try THE AGAVE, with organic trquila, lime, and agave.   For dinner at my favorite booth, we started with their hand crafted Traditional Guacamole.  It has avocado, tomatoe, onion, chiles, serrano, cilantro; and, great chips!  I tell you this is a meal all by itself.   They are famous for their PORK!  So I had their Carnitas Hacienda.  As before it was super good, tender and tasty. One guest joined me in this Pork.  We had Trapiche Cabernet wine to go with this great Pork.   One guest had the Halibut Entree.   She said it was as good as it gets, Very fresh, tender and tasty.   My wife had a steak Filet that she said was tender and very good. We were all quite full and did not have dessert.   Our waiter Fonzy was super quick to all our many requests, ie extra ice, water, etc.  Fonzy was most professional, sharp; and even took a FACEBOOK picture of our group living it up Big time at the Fairmonts La Hacienda.  Truly, as two of my guests comented who live in Scottsdale but, have never been to this restaurant that this was a very exciting gourmet experience.      In my opinion, Manager Dustin Martin does an outstanding job of making ALL guest happy with drinks, food; and, service.  sincerely,  Ed Altman  Jr."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for me but, heck, I'm on 'girls weekend'! Started with the guacamole tableside - AWESOME!  Our server?  From start to finish was the reason for the 4 stars - attentive, but also knew to let us girls chatter.... made suggestions, explained dishes - took complete care of us! Thank you Angel ... you are truly an angel! If I had to say there was any disappointment it was that the servings were minimal - and the tequila flight looked a little lighter than a 1.5 oz single shot - more like a 1.0 oz small shot -- a little light for a 'flight' at their costs - the cost of the El Presidente warrants a bit heavier pour! The café de fuego - entertaining and a perfect addition to the churros & dipping sauce - the dipping sauce was the highlight of that dessert! Don't forget the chocolate cups are delightfully edible. We will definitely return to try happy hour, just probably not for dinner.... Angel can you take care of us at Happy Hour?"}
