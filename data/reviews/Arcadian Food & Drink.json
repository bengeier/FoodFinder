{"text":"Pretty sad. Went here once and was itching to go back. Reminded me of my favorite place to hangout in Fukuoka. Every bite of every plate was Delish! I wanted to try every drink on the cocktail list too!  Can someone please \"reopen\" ?"}
{"text":"Perfect timing.  Our volleyball team was looking to celebrate the end of our season, and there just happened to be a new restaurant opening in Gordon Square.  So what better place to celebrate than to head over to Arcadian on Detroit.

Fancy? Not at all.  The atmosphere is upscale but the staff is not. The music was upbeat Motown.  There was a great mix of casual diners and the staff was more than willing to put together a table for 8 upstairs.  The menu was a mix of seafood and lighter fair, including pizzas and since we were in the celebratory mood we chose the pizza route and ordered one of each for the table just to try them out.

The verdict: 12 thumbs up.  The clam pizza disappeared with a swiftness not seen since our opponents dispatched us in 3 straight earlier in the evening on the volleyball court.  The pepperoni had quite a bit of heat, while the sausage and mushroom had a nice sweetness to it to balance out the meat.  The \"Plain Jane\" was solid, and a great go to if you're not feeling adventurous.  There is also a vegetarian as well, which I passed on due to moral objections.  Those that did have some it said it's flavor was good and was \"surprising\".  We also got a side of bread sticks.

A number of us had drinks as well, and those that did posed for many photos and had multiple toasts with their drinks before downing them.  And down them they did.  

Great choice for a group hang, but also a great place for a date night.  The charm of a downtown hot spot without (hopefully) the madness that comes with a downtown hotspot.  A great opening night for Arcadian."}
{"text":"My husband and I came for dinner and had a fantastic experience. The service was impeccable, the drinks were great, and the food was very good. The waitstaff was incredibly attentive without being overbearing, the manager was great, delivering our pizza. Multiple staff members came to the table to clear plates, deliver food, etc. it felt like a true team effort which was great. 

The food itself was all natural ingredients, and a clever play on traditional items. We had a pizza with smoked blue cheese and what I think were oyster mushrooms, an improvement to the traditional mushroom and sausage pizza. 

A great addition to the neighborhood and well worth your time."}
{"text":"I've been eager to check this place out.  By the solitary A sign outside, I wasn't sure of the name or if it was offically open to the public. 

Stopped in for cocktails and loved the ambiance.  Read through the menu and liked the selections.  Did not eat.  

One major, major turn off - the place smelled like grease.  I sat on the patio and the smell  waffed out everytime the servers opened the door. I slammed the cocktail and left.  I did not want to smell like that for the remainder of my evening. 

I didn't notice anyone else mention this in any of their reviews.  Is this a regular occurance or did I just happen in on a bad night?

If this is a regular occurence, please have your ventilation checked.  Or 86 the fried chicken from the menu. 

I'd like to go back for dinner, but I also don't want to smell like a short order cook from a greasy spoon."}
{"text":"Pretty weak for the price. If you're going to play
In the $28 entree game time to step up the game. Nice server. Cool dining space. A bit over lit. Definitely smells like grease. Due to the fryers at front door. Gross. 

Food was so - so. Fried chicken tasted burned. Bland slaw as a side. The seafood stew was in a good broth but the protein was weak it in portion size and quality. The shrimp were tiny and over cooked. I didn't get much salmon in my serving. Two crab claws that were just blah.

Overall pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"CLOSED SUDDENLY TODAY: Just read on Cleveland Scene that the owners changed the locks on the building and everyone, including the chefs, are locked out.  Looks like it's closed after only 4 months!"}
{"text":"I felt like I was eating fast food but paying high-end prices.  I was shown to a table that was horrible, that was in a separate area from the main restaurant. It wasn't the bar area, which I usually love, but in a front area with zero atmosphere. We decided to wait 10 minutes for a four top in the main restaurant.  15 minutes later, a table of four showed up and sat next to us at the bar. Coincidentally, we knew them and hung out and spoke to them. They were also showed the same table we originally were, and also decided to wait for a different table. Ironically, despite coming 15 minutes after us, they were seated before us. They informed us they made a big deal about the wait and that was why they rushed to seat them before us. When we asked the host why they were seated before us, they just changed the subject and offered us free drinks. We could not have been more clear, we wanted the table that we were promised in 10 minutes - but they told us it would be 30 more minutes. The host was incredibly condescending!  Our friends who showed up AFTER us and were offered the table BEFORE us were even horrified. Honestly, we could've overlooked that if the food was any good. We ordered pizzas that were mediocre at best. A cauliflower dish that sounded awesome as described, but was totally bland and unimpressive. The food was just mediocre. We love to try new restaurants and we were excited to try this restaurant in this very cool area. Such a letdown!! On a Saturday night, it was only half full (yet wouldn't seat us without a complaint) and a small restaurant! If you're looking for a scene and great food, skip this place! You will thank me!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great! However, the menu is over priced and the food was nothing special. I do recommend the smoked mussels!"}
{"text":"Super sad that this place closed. I'm glad I was able to go when I did - it was during Indians playoffs, I sat at the bar with my friend and we ordered drinks and the seasonal pizza, which was delicious and enough to share between 2 people. I wanted to take my boyfriend back, but unless a miracle happens, I don't think that it will happen."}
{"text":"I love it here so much that I would be okay coming here on a weekly basis! I arrived early before a girls dinner and sat at the bar and enjoyed the HH red wine on tap (yes you read that correctly) and the spicy carrot hummus- which is stellar! How many places can you get carrot hummus? None that I know of! It was flavorful and made me feel healthy as it was served with a variety of vegetables and these wonderful soda crackers.

Once my group arrived we sat upstairs that had a different type of ambience (maybe because we were the only ones for a bit). Our waitress was very knowledgeable and could explain all the ingredients we had questions about. The crazy thing is that my waitress and bartender both named their favorite items on the menu for me and they were the exact same items! I always love eating with groups because it allows me to try so many things in one sitting. Collectively we ordered the Spicy Pepperoni pizza, the specialty pizza which was; pumpkin, squash, blue cheese, farm cheese, caramelized onions and almonds, Fried Peanuts, French Fries and the Eggs and Bacon. The specialty pizza was so good that I ate my leftovers for breakfast!

Overall, I love, love, love the pizzas and I am already planning my next visit. I also really like the trendy feel without the hefty prices or fancy dress code."}
{"text":"This place was underwhelming at best.  There was nothing exciting about any food item We ordered.  The chicken was oily and bland.  The scallops were over done.  The smoked salmon was the only saving grace. Salad was okay.  Nothing to brag about.  They need to get it together for the prices they charge. Oh, and the worst part is that people from my dinner party got food poisoning!  Shape up!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love.  Got here a little earlier than the group I was meeting for dinner so I sat at the bar for some happy hour drinks and bites.  Got a good deal on a draft beer and the crazy awesome spicy carrot hummus-as in licking the plate to make sure I got it all awesome. The bar tender was super friendly and recommended any of the pizzas and gave very descriptive reasons for trying each one.  When it was time for dinner I got the seasonal pizza of pumpkin, squash, caramelized onion, toasted almonds and farmers cheese on a medium thick buttered crust. Fantastic!  That is the type of food I need on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"Yes. Wow. Awesome. 

Had dinner here tonight and it really was fate to end up in here. Started down the street at spice and had such terrible service just trying to get drinks that we walked down the street and came across this newly opened gem. 

Service was amazing from the gentleman who enthusiastically greeted us at the door to the hostess and our server, Steve. Such warm and friendly service all around. 

Drinks menu was extensive in terms of craft beers and tasty sounding cocktails. Need to try a few of those next time because the table next to us got a few and they seemed pretty happy with them. 

Food was so so so good. Started w the fried peanuts and the French fries w this amazing French onion dip. I'd come back for just those. 

Friend and I got the spicy pepperoni pizza. You know how some pizza's crust is a carrier for the topping? Not here. The sourdough crust was light and tasty and great on its own. The entire pizza was delicious w a great complementary combination of garlic pepperoni spice and kale. Other friend got bacon and eggs (sounds silly, wasn't at all). Just look at the pictures and try not to salivate. She said every bit was astonishing, from the pork belly bacon and fried potato down to the seasonal jam and butter. 

Did I mention this place just opened? You'd never know by the meal. 

So good. Wish these guys the best of luck."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place because it is walkable and the space is amazing. I hadn't realized they opened because there is just a metal sign with an A out front. 
The good-
Service was great, friendly, prompt, informative
Cocktails were delicious- creative good variety 
Offered house hot sauce- loved it 
Clams casino pizza- awesome bacon topping, thick crust, very filling 

The meh-
Salmon entree- awesome crispy skin, but over cooked and dry, butter was flavored but not in a good way
Filet- was fine, under seasoned the guacamole and onion was good but the roasted pepper didn't add anything. It was more steak with things I had left in my fridge then a well composed dish

There was a lot of mention of gluten free, so if that is your wheel house then definitely check it out

Would definitely give them another chance once they have time to settle in and revamp some menu options or for happy hour"}
{"text":"Yes. Two thumbs way up.  From the food, to the drinks, to the service and beautiful space-- I loved it here.  We were greeted by a really friendly guy, I'm guessing the manager, and he let us pick where we wanted to sit upstairs.  My friend and I ordered several items from the raw bar and were super impressed with the quality of seafood and presentation.  I can see myself catching a show at the Capitol Theatre, eating here then finishing off at Sweet Moses down the street.  It was pouring down rain when we left and someone even ran out with an umbrella for us. The exceptional hospitality did not go unnoticed."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a new addition to the Detroit-Shoreway neighborhood! And just in time, too! Prior to seeing a midnight movie at the Capitol, my group of five decided to give this new place a try. The architecture and design of the space is incredible, it is simply gorgeous! The host was very friendly and we didn't even have to wait for a table. I ordered a glass of the rose, which was priced at $8.50, which I felt was on par with most restaurants. They also had a nice list of local craft beers and cocktails. We ordered some pizza, which was AWESOME. It was on a thicker crust that had this asiago cheese thing going on. In fact, I was kind of shocked by the size of the pizza, I was actually expecting it to be much smaller, so we ended up taking leftovers with us. The only complaint I would have is that a) the music was SO LOUD we could barely hear each other talk. While I liked what they were playing, it was a little much. And b) my sister ordered the brandy rumtail and whoa. If you lit a match within two feet of that thing it would have gone up in flames. It wasn't even drinkable, honestly. I'm sure if she had asked our server, he would have been happy to replace it with something less--flammable, but she felt that it was her own mistake in ordering it. So, not sure how that would have actually worked out. Overall though, I am a fan and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this restaurant since I first heard the great reviews when it was opened and I was not disappointed. There was not a complaint about my visit s giving it 5 stars. I went here with a friend on the night of an Indians playoff game so we grabbed a seat at the bar, but there were plenty of open seats in the restaurant. I decided to try a draught wine since I had never heard of that before, and it was good! My friend and I split the smoked salmon appetizer and squash and pumpkin pizza. The smoked salmon was really good, different than I expected. And the pizza was amazing! It had blue cheese on it, but neither of us were fans of it so we requested without. The pizza was the perfect size to split, my suggestion to do that or you'll be taking half of it home (which isn't a bad thing). The staff here was also very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Nice place w very good food & cocktails! Love that they serve cava. Cauliflower & pickled veggie plate were excellent! And best oysters I've ever had! Loved the real shredded horseradish!"}
{"text":"The space itself is quite impressive from an architectural and interior design standpoint.  The menu continues to improve and provide lots of interesting and tasty options that are all done with high quality ingredients and presentation.  They have a solid happy hour menu and great pizza if you are looking for cheaper options.  Overall, this is a great addition to the Gordon Square neighborhood and definitely worth giving a try."}
{"text":"Fabulous!!!  The atmosphere is totally clean and hip.  The menu is limited but simple and delicious.  They are doing everything right!  Artistically presented seasonal food, great flavors fresh ingredients. MY new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"My partner and I went for a date night and decided to try Arcadian from the list of many new places that have opened this summer. We were quite pleased by the atmosphere. The upstairs area looked like a fun place to enjoy people watching, but we love to see the kitchen at work. The noise level from music and talking was just right. We were seated right by the kitchen, and were able to see and hear everything going on. The staff seemed to be busy, yet happy. The chef was all over the place, but had everything under control. It was quite delightful to watch. The service was divine. We couldn't blink without someone sneaking over to refill our water, make sure we were satisfied, or any number of other things. Never hovering/smothering either.

We got the smoked salmon for an appetizer and it was excellent.The smokey flavor was spot on, without being too salty like many smoked and dried fish can be. We shared the special clam pizza which was delicious. We took the gluten free crust option and it was firm, crunchy enough and over all had excellent texture and taste. The toppings were fantastic. Excellent portion size for two to share. The experience was so wonderful that my partner stopped and talked to the manager/owner. We made a point of complimenting the chef to him, which he immediately shared with her.

In regard to other comments and reviews, I don't know what others experienced, but there was certainly NO greasy smell and we were immediately next to the kitchen. There was NO Gangsta Rap blaring in the room. It was pleasant atmospheric music. Did it occur to you to ask them to turn down the music? You know people will do that if you ask. It might just be too loud for you, I don't know."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken I've ever had.  Pizza was fabulous too.  Perfect place to hang - mix of upscale and casual - with original cocktails and cool design to space.  This kind of restaurant is special for Cleveland.  Couldn't recommend it more."}
