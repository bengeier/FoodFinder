{"text":"I order deliveries to LA and they always come on time. Customer service is great - staff is always courteous & helpful. Portions are sizable and balanced with good quality ingredients. There are several main portion/side item choices, which keeps dishes versatile & interesting. Prices are affordable, especially for the quality. I'm always really busy to cook, and since ordering meals I definitely go out to eat less and feel much healthier."}
{"text":"I've been looking for something like this for a while.. and i've tried many of these prepared meal programs.. but this one is the BEST.  I love the portion sizes and the freshness of each meal.. I can grab a pack and run off to work .. eat it there and i'm not feeling like I'm off my meal plan all the time.   I open it up and almost everyone is asking where i got it from.. the vegges are green and fresh... the meats are tasty and the package is easy to use.   I can't recommend it enough..  I am hoping this is an long and ongoing relationship I'll have with Body Food Kitchen."}

{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Body Food Kitchen.  My husband and I always talk about how so few companies out there get customer service right.  Body Food Kitchen is one of the very, very few that actually exceeds my expectations.  The food is delicious and they have accommodated all my tweaks to the orders and done it within minutes or hours of me sending my requests over.  I travel a lot as well and they have been able to adjust my food shipments to accommodate my crazy travel schedule. I am getting ready for my next bodybuilding competition and this has saved me hours upon hours of time and stress.  This place is truly AMAZING and a life saver!!!  I wish I found this place a long time ago!"}
{"text":"This saved my life....Hate grocery shopping, hate cooking, and have a tendency to go to McD when I'm hungry. They deliver right to my office and the food is excellent. Highly recommend Body Food Kitchen for anyone that wants convenient, healthy, and delicious meals. Five stars."}

{"text":"I was in town for a while and hate going out to eat all the time.  I had been to other cities that have the same concept, but body food has been, by far, the best.  In fact, I'm doing the national delivery now that i'm back home.  highly recommend to anyone looking to stay regimented with eating and are time restricted!"}
{"text":"I have only great things to say about Body Food Kitchen.  5 Stars all the way!  They have the best customer service, the deliveries are always on time, the food is super fresh and clean, and I can depend on them.  This is the 3rd time I have used BFK for my meal prep before a photo shoot.  The food is so natural and clean that it keeps my skin clear and my belly flat and always works to remove water and bloating without any cravings.  I would recommend this company to anyone who is really serious about their fitness goals."}
