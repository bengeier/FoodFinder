{"text":"Thanks to Yelpers for helping me find this brand new cafe. It's a gem. The space is a 2-story atrium with lots of natural light, which makes it a great place to enjoy a good breakfast and leisurely coffee. I had a delicious Greek omelette and an excellent latte. The service was fast and friendly. Ginkgo is a tapas bar in the evening, and I look forward to returning for that experience."}
{"text":"Very good! After a long bus ride Ginkgo certainly hit the spot for some delicious brunch fare. The aesthetic is very nice and feels pretty hip, with high ceilings and careful decorations. My friend and I both opted for the Florentine eggs benedict which was basically an eggs Benedict with white cheddar and spinach. The breakfast potatoes were REALLY good. I am a bit of breakfast potato connoisseur, and these were delicious. Very crispy with green onions and maybe a squeeze of lemon. It also came with a fresh fruit salad and a coffee or tea. I did not know that it came with coffee or tea and had ordered a tea, and when we saw the price of the breakfast not including the tea we informed our waitress who informed us that it was included, which was a nice surprise! However, I think they should advertise this. The price was very reasonable, and came out to just over $15 with tax for quite a lot of food and a drink in a very aesthetically pleasing location. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Je dois dire que le décor est super beau et très Pinterest! Je comprends pourquoi il y tant de personnes qui sont sous le charme. Je suis venue pour un brunch avec une amie et j'ai été déçue de mon repas. J'ai commandé une assiette de pain doré accompagnée de fraises et j'ai constaté que c'était déjà tiède. Peut-être que je reviendrai pour donner une nouvelle chance."}
{"text":"Vanessa and Ali were phenomenal employees! The food was excellent and the drinks were too.  Can't say enough great things about this place."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated restaurant on Saint-Catherine in UQAM University. Food is very good and you get so much for what you are paying, prices are very low. I had for breakfast a Poutine; basically breakfast potatoes, cheese curds and hollandaise sauce for only 6$, it's one of their unique item on their menu. Other the other hand, the coffee was not good.. very disappointing, couldn't finish my cup..  

Overall experience: totally going to show up there again for another Breakfast Poutine."}
{"text":"Une nouvelle place vraiment très cool dans l'uqam ! Je n'ai pas encore mangé dans le restaurant mais j'ai pris un cocktail. ( qui etait tres bon ) 

De plus, le look de ce resto/bar est tout simplement hallucinant ! C'est vraiment TROP beau ! Je vais y retourner c'est certain !"}
{"text":"First meal after arriving to Montreal! Great wait staff, patient with us non-French speaking tourists... menu was only in French, which was a small upset (many other locations had both English and French options)

Interior atmosphere was modern, appealing and large amounts of natural lighting. Many people, but quiet enough for conversation. 

- phenomenal espresso
- tuna wrap was light yet filling
- breakfast omelette 3-4 eggs and hearty. 

Would go back"}
{"text":"This is place is nothing but stunning,adorable and very \"instagram worthy\" BUT that's all that it is. My colleagues and I went decided to work there for the day. Turns out instead of closing with their regular hours at midnight they were closing at 4pm. The least they could have done is write a message on their Facebook or online indicating a change of closing time. 

As for the food...one of my colleagues order a salmon bagel it looked pasty and a weird pink colour. Someone else ordered eggs Benedict both eggs were completely HARD BOILED! Although they were more than happy to replace the eggs, hard boiled is simply a basic no-no when it comes to eggs Benedict!
As for me I ordered the meat lover plate ,comes with potatoes,2eggs,bacon,ham,sausage and apple sauce. The majority was good and filling but the apple sauce was had a tart like flavour,not pleasant.

Killed it on the decor but the food needs to be improved tremendously."}
{"text":"I stopped by Ginkgo a week ago for a quick poutine and coffee during lunch. I sat at the bar, which had ample space and received very attentive service. The place itself has ton of lights, which is perfect for these cold Montréal mornings. 

I had the chorizo poutine. It was quite good. The chorizo was sweeter than I expected, and so was the gravy. The gravy was thick and with plenty of fresh cheese curds, it melted like it's supposed to. I'm not sure I was a fan of the potatoes, however. That said, in the area, I wouldn't hesitate to order the poutine again. The price was right."}
{"text":"Just tried this place on our first visit to Montreal... First it's super cute, really bright with a lot of greenery. We sat at the bar and the bartender was super friendly and helpful. We ordered lattes which were really good and the breakfast poutine to start. The poutine was so delicious, I think it has a hollandaise in the gravy.. anyway 5 stars! We also ordered the fruit waffle and an eggs benedict. Both were outstanding. We would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this new place! Gorgeous interior, DJ at night. Friendly and knowledgeable staff, and awesome drinks! Definitely a must go when visiting Montreal for a nice night out"}
{"text":"I'm going to need Yelp to have a special \"10 stars\" option because this place was definitely it and then some!

Girls trip in Montreal, 8 am on a Saturday morning and we are hungryyy. Scroll down my Yelp timeline and Ginkgo's is it. We walk in and the place itself is so calming and charmingly decorated. Already like it (sucker for decor). We are early birds so there weren't many people in there which was super fine with us. The waitress was super friendly and explained the menu to us since we didn't understand French (still manageable to make out what items are). My order consists of French toast with strawberries and a side of potatoes (gotta have my sweet and savory). When this deliciousness got delivered in front of my face I went to town. And by this I mean cleared my whole damn plate almost wanted to lick it too. It was so fresh and hit all the right spots that I wanted to come back for lunch dinner and more! The potatoes were made so crisp with a zing of celery (new to me) and the French toast was just to die for. 

But you know what the cherry on top was? The bill! I couldn't believe the price we paid for this awesomeness of food. I was ready to drop $50 and more that's how good it was. This place just couldn't get any better. I did see that they are open late in the AM, which next time I'm in Montreal I will definitely have to check out what that's all about."}
{"text":"Very nice brunch place, with an extensive menu! Although at the time of my visit, they didn't have an English menu, it's still a straightforward order and I doubt you can go wrong with anything on the menu.

My partner and I ordered the Montréalais and the Demi-Demi (both benedicts). Both were delicious, the portion sizes were enormous, and prices are very reasonable for a beautiful place like this.

The atmosphere is excellent, the service is good. The potatoes on the side are top notch and the fruit bowl given with the meal made for an excellent palette cleanser after our heavy meals. I would certainly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés dans le cadre du 5@7 d'ouverture et j'adore l'endroit! C'est tellement beau, tu vas pleurer des yeux! Nous n'avons pris qu'un drink (donc pas goûté à la nourriture) et il était vraiment bon, nous l'avons reproduit à la maison! 

Sinon, je crois que les prix sont raisonnables, mais il me faudrait y retourner pour conclure !!"}
{"text":"I had a first so-so experience, but they were in a soft opening, which is understandable.  Second time over was great and it is definitely a cute spot to check.  Service was nice and smiling, but most importantly quick.  Finally, the food was delicious.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I (both huge brunch-lovers) were planning a weekend trip to Montreal and discovered this place through Instagram. We made reservations online for a Saturday morning (huge plus since brunch places can get busy quite fast and the worst thing is waiting in line with an empty stomach!) 

We walked in to a beautiful aesthetic - an open space with lots of plants and different tables (high, low, group etc) and were greeted by our lovely server. Their menu has a variety of options, from eggs benedicts, omelettes, french toast, crepes and waffles, so there's definitely something for everyone! My friend and I both ordered the Florentine eggs Benedict, that also came with some amazing hash browns and a fresh bowl of fruit. The only one suggestion that I would make is to tell the customers ahead of time that all of the breakfast platters come with a free drink (like coffee or tea) because that's an awesome bonus that we didn't know about until the bill came! 

Overall, a fantastic brunch spot with great service, an aesthetic space, and some great food - I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Découvert dans le cadre de leur 5 à 7 after work (Rabais Montréal 5$ pour 2 drinks), nous étions 3 et avons tous été très déçus. 

Nous arrivons avec nos coupons et nous asseyons à une table pour 4 avec 2 grands fauteuils et un petit sofa, la serveuse nous tombe dessus direct: Selon elle, nous ne pouvons pas choisir notre place. Je lui demande ce qu'on peut prendre avec les coupons, elle me répond de la bière pression (Bud) ou du vin (alors que sur l'offre il est noté cocktail ou bière) et nous devons aller chercher nos verres au bar.
Notre ami vient nous rejoindre sans coupon rabais mais on lui refuse l'entrée... Nous ne comprenons pas... Je vais donc le chercher à l'extérieur et l'invite à s'asseoir avec nous en passant par la porte de l'Université.

La serveuse passe 3 ou 4 fois pour nous demander ce que nous voulons manger alors que nous en somme à l'apér... juste une question... un 5 à 7 after-work-réseautage ce n'est pas pour discuter entre collègues d'abord??! Les plats commandés n'étaient pas fameux et aseptisés en plus!

À la fin du repas je vais pour prendre un 2nd verre de vin et demande gentiment à notre serveuse si elle peut me l'apporter (à ce moment là nous en sommes à environ 30$/tête d'addition) et celle-ci me répond qu'elle peut exceptionnellement me l'apporter. 
Moi je peux aussi exceptionnellement lui donner du pourboire... Et la féliciter d'avoir bousculer environ 5 ou 6 fois mon voisin en passant à côté de lui, c'est gratos!

Pour résumé:
Accueil: Sélectif
Service: Exécrable
Nourriture: Sans intérêt
Ambiance: Moyenne"}
{"text":"L'endroit est très sympa avec une bonne ambiance. Pour un 5@7 avec les collègues ou juste pour passer se poser et prendre un verre ! Les serveurs sont sympas et l'endroit est très chaleureux ! J'ai adoré la décoration... mon petit point c'est au niveau du gâteau que j'ai commandé, c'était un gâteau au fromage mais à mon goût y'avait trop de chocolat que du fromage... Mais bon, le gâteau était délicieux pareillement."}
{"text":"This place is stunning and looks so promising but unfortunately it's deceiving. They spent so much money on the decor but the food leaves much to be desired. The wine list is disappointing. If this is pub food then say so otherwise it can't be considered anything other than that!
The service was amazing, our server was great and accommodating
At the end of the day not what  we expected and our table of 9 not one of us was happy."}
{"text":"This café has two sections, one is more casual and the other is more chic/ trendy. They put a lot of plants inside the café, which make the whole space more organic and green. It is a great place to study and do school work, but also to have a good brunch. They also have a bar and serve cocktail and wine. Of course they have a lot of coffee choices, and comparatively, the brunch menu needs more options. I tried their fruit mountain platter, but they forgot to give me the walnut at first. The service was a bit slow, probably because I didn't order the brunch sitting in the brunch section of the restaurant (i was sitting at the café section first). I think that the concept of duo café-restaurant is nice, but the café section is relatively small compared to the restaurant part. However the café is next to UQAM, so I expect a lot of university students would go there to study, maybe make the café section a bit bigger for people to have space to study and all!"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful and very attractive. As we walked in, I immediately thought of a similar restaurant in New York called \"NOMO\" and that is what brought me to Ginkgo today. However, I must admit that the experience was not at all the same as the similar restaurant in new york. To begin, there was no wait and there was seating available, but it took someone about 8 minutes to notice that we were waiting to be seated. As we were seated, we had a look at the menu and they had lots of brunch options to choose from. Ordering was pretty easy, the horror came after. It took at least 35 minutes to recieve our food (we were only two). When we got our food, we asked for ketchup and our toasts and we had to wait at least another 5 minutes. The food was already cold and we couldn't enjoy the experience. As it went on,  I never got any refills of my coffee or asked if we wanted more toast (they only gave us two pieces). The food was nothing special or memorable at all. No one ever came back to see how we were doing and we had to ask the waitress for the bill. She never came back knowing we asked for the bill and we had to get up ourselves and wait for her by her counter. She would come back to her cash but didn't pull out our bill. She would just go on and serve her customers. After another 5 minutes, she finally got us the bill. Let's just say she got a crappy tip from us because since the beggining, she looked like she hated working there. For decor and music I give them 5 stars, but for service i'll give them 1 star and food 3 stars. Would I come back? Probably just for the decor, but not expecting much more."}
{"text":"Beautiful space, but the food and service are extremely lacking.  If you don't speak French, you will be talked down at.  There are no English menus.  Even beyond that though, the food is horrible. I had French toast, and they serve the thin slices completely dry.  No powdered sugar, no syrup, no butter.  Syrup is available for an extra charge.  

My friend ordered a spinach crepe.  She received a crepe with no spinach.   The waitress told my friend (in French) that the mistake was because the cook was dense and spoke English.

We were only one of three tables occupied on a Monday morning at 9:30am 

There are definitely much better places nearby."}
{"text":"Un espace vert très reposant pour prendre un bon brunch du dimanche. Le repas est plutôt copieux et les assiettes sont très bien présentées. Le serveur semblait un peu perdu mais cela devait être liée à une ouverture assez récente. Pour autant, je recommande ce nouveau lieu sans aucune hésitation."}
