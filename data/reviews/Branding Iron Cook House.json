{"text":"Based on a single visit...  I would give this place 5 stars for sure if it were just a bit less expensive. I got the Black and Bleu burger. It was just about the best hamburger I've ever eaten.  The atmosphere was \"woody\" and dim. Very comfortable. It looked like they had 2 dining rooms. Not sure what the other one was like.  They have a menu full of things that I consider comfort foods. Burgers, Nachos, wings, steaks and the like. I plan to go back soon and order some different things. I'll likely update this review as I do.  At this point I would recommend the place. They have their menu online. You may want to look at the prices before you go."}
{"text":"This is my personal review of the place... I've gone to this branding iron for quite a while now  probably say about 4 to 6 times...first off the atmosphere is awesome it has that rustic charm and feel that you're in a abandoned gas station truck stop... In the same sense a kind of reminds me of the old western style bars... Say in Texas for example.. It has a mix of both but in a weird way it works for its advantage... Okay about the food... The food here is pretty good the problem is inconsistency... One night we had burgers and they were cooked perfectly ... About two months later we came back in the burgers were not cooked the way we like them... I myself like a well-done burger and found it was mostly raw inside...next time we came after that again the burger was cooked perfectly... This was followed by again a mess up by their kitchen... We try to bring this up to our server and the server in question told us we are extremely picky... After she said that she walked away in disgust... Sorry I don't like to eat something that is so raw you can hear it moo.... The next time we went the burger was cooked correctly... The lack of inconsistency really hurts I don't know if they're constantly changing cooks or other people were making the burger and they're being sent out before there looked at... I worked a lot a restaurants.. I've seen food go out that was not cooked properly... You can usually tell right off the bat if something is not cooked all the way through... In the case of this place the prices are extremely high... I asked for a small salad and I got a salad the size of the salsa bowl... I am not joking the salad was mini.... And this was their house salad... My final review is practically this... If you do go and you ask for medium well burgers check your burgers before you eat... You never know on a good night or bad night if it didn't be raw inside...I give it two stars out of five... Only because I know they could do better."}
{"text":"I've driven past the Branding Iron Cookhouse for years on the way out to Headlands Beach and been very intrigued--what's not to love about barbeque? After purchasing a discount coupon on restaurant.com, Sheila F. and I headed out to the Branding Iron Cookhouse with empty stomachs and excited spirits.  We started off the meal by ordering a variety of appetizers. The Sampler Platter consisted of fried pierogies, boneless wings, and mini corn dogs. All of the above were great and came with a variety of dipping sauces. In addition, we ordered the Cream Cheese Pretzel, which was the most delicious item that we enjoyed all evening long. The pretzel was unexpectedly fluffy and sweet and would make a great dessert!  Just as we had finished enjoying those delights, our entrees came right to the table. I ordered the Loaded Grilled Cheese Burger, which was a double cheeseburger with a grilled cheese sandwich stuck in between the two hamburger patties. Yes, you read that correctly--there was another whole sandwich in the middle of my burger! This burger was the reverse of Michael Symon's Pulled Pork Grilled Cheese Sandwich at the now-closed Bar Symon, which consisted of two grilled cheese sandwiches that contained perfectly smoked pulled pork in between them. My wife ordered the Mac-N-Cheeseburger, which was a burger covered in macaroni and cheese and ham. While the flavor of the overall burger was good, the sheer weight of the toppings made it a bit hard to eat by hand and she had to use a knife and fork to eat.   Don't worry, we took home some leftovers. We also took home a relatively full wallet due to the fact that the prices at the Branding Iron Cookhouse are quite reasonable. $9.00 or so for a loaded gourmet burger that is too gigantic to eat in one sitting is a great deal! Plus, the mixed drinks are reasonably priced....$4.00 for a Three Olives and Coke is a steal compared to some other places in Cleveland!"}
