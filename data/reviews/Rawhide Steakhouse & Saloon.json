{"text":"Food - pretty good
Entertainment - a plus to have some live music
Prices - great
Service - average

We came here after a day game in Scottsdale for spring training.  There was a concert there that night so getting to parking took a bit but there was plenty.  When you go into the gate, there is a quaint western town with shops and stuff for the kids to do.  The restaurant itself looks spot on like an old Western Saloon.  Inside is very spacious and were were there on a night with a band covering a variety of songs.

The food was pretty good.  The steakhouse chili had good flavor and the chunks of steak were flavorful and tender.  The jalapeno corn bread muffins were very tasty and came with a cinnamon and regular butter.  The sweet and slightly spicy flavor was good enough that my toddler daughter actually ate them.  She had mini corn dogs as well and let me tell you, I think they gave her a box, there were at least dozen, kept her very happy.  My wife had st louis ribs, good bbq sauce, sweet, smoky and fall of the bone.  I had a filet and it had a good char for flavor and was ok.  I got a cole slaw and loaded baked potato on the side.  The potato was cooked well and the accompaniments were very good.

Overall, we were quite happy and walked away pretty full."}
{"text":"I am super lenient when it comes to service at restaurants, because I recognize what a logistical nightmare it can be. However, the service at this place was just bizarre.

Bottom line: the hostess, server, kitchen, and manager on duty seemed stressed and disorganized. The problem here has got to lie with upper management.

Initially, there was a weird seating brouhaha. First, we weren't allowed to hang out at the bar prior to our reservation time in the main dining room (??), then we were allowed, then we were allowed to be seated early in the bar area.

After getting drinks at the bar, and being seated at 7:30 or so, we were ignored by the single waitress working all the bar tables (!!) until about 8:00. I got the impression that nobody had told her we would be ordering food. Our appetizers arrived at about 8:30, at which point another table who was seated after us got their entrees. We inquired about our entrees around 9:00, and she seemed horrified that they hadn't come out yet. A manager finally brought us our food at about 9:15, and gave us a substantial percentage discount on our bill.

That's almost 2 hours between being seated and getting our entrees. Wtf?????

The food was tasty--nothing really extraordinary, but everything had good flavor and was cooked nicely, with reasonable portion sizes for the price."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was skeptical of dining there.  We did have reservations and checked in a half hour early.   After being told we'd have to wait until our designated time we were seated after 5 minutes.  Good service and the meal was enjoyable.   The seating area did get to about 75% capacity but for those without reservations they were out of luck.  All I could figure was that they were trying very hard to be able to have only the necessities for one evening and not invest in allot of excess perishable inventory.   I could be way off base but would love to know the explanation. 
But with all of that said, it was an enjoyable meal, service good and the band pleasant."}
{"text":"Walking into this I didn't expect 5 star steakhouse. Atmosphere was the main appeal. Got sat in the darkest booth with missing lights. That should have been the first sign. Server didn't come to us for at least 10 minutes of getting seated. Ordered the sirloin. Good flavor but don't order the season vegetables. Mac & cheese had no flavor. Our server was nothing more than average.  I'd come back again if I were here with newbies."}
{"text":"I was highly disappointed with the food at Rawhide Steak House.  I am a meat and potatoes girl.  I am not a foodie by any means so for me to actually leave a bad review is a big deal.  I am only providing this feedback in the hopes that things change.  The plus of the meal was the steak.  It was cooked perfectly and had been seasoned well.  The downside was everything else.  The salad was just lettuce dumped on a plate.  It didn't even come with croutons.  Worst of all the lettuce was slimy and brown.  The rolls were not fresh.  They were a bit hard like they had been sitting out all day.  The macaroni was bland and it was at room temperature.  The corn on the cob was disgusting.  It looked and tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge for two weeks.  Chef Ramsey would have had a fit if he seen the slop they brought out of the kitchen.  I have ate here before and the food was delicious.  I don't understand what has changed but this needs to be fixed otherwise this place will go out of business.  Could explain why there was hardly anyone there."}
{"text":"I have been going to Rawhide off and on for years ever since it was at it's prior location.  The steakhouse and saloon is very nice inside and the Christmas tree really nice too.  The menu me and my family were given was a bit shocking.  I had to ask the waitress if this was all there was on it, and she yes, a lot of changes have been made. The menu is one page and not a whole lot of things to select from.  No more huge steaks, no loaded baked potato, no corn bread, no bread with that great butter they used to have, no fried rattlesnake. Pretty much you get a small piece of corn, small cup or baked beans, and small cup of mac & cheese.  The food itself is bland, my wife and daughter had the barbecue chicken and it was dry.  I had the steak and it was okay, but had way better steak here in the past.  Wish they would go back to the way it was before, but I wonder if it is due to lack of patrons."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!
My husband took me for my birthday and they were not staffed correctly for the HUGE event they were having! (maybe 3 waitresses) There were more open tables than there were tables that were occupied but they would not let us sit and eat they said we needed a reservation and we wouldn't be able to eat until 8pm! it was about 2pm. The waitresses and hostess' were rude and couldn't care less weather we ate or not, it seemed as if this was normal! We finally got a manager to let us order take out from the bar but they didn't want to give us silverware to eat with WTF? portion sizes were very small and not worth the price at all maybe if we got to experience the ambiance and the actual restaurant then it could have been worth it but over all the whole experience sucked. Plus we had to pay $10 to park and there was not forewarning for that either."}
{"text":"Have been here before and loved it but it was a far different experience tonight. I made reservations in person five days in advance because I couldn't get through on the phone. To my surprise when  we arrived (party of 12) there was no reservation.  We finally arranged for a table but we're told it had to be on one card. Then we were told we could use no more than three cards.  The meals were ordered but came luke warm and most people got the wrong orders or only partial orders.  I could not believe how much the restaurant had gone downhill since our slat visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. $22 buffet and 18% gratuity to top it off!  Food: prime rib, steak and mashed potatoes good.  Otherwise sub par for Denny's. Dessert nothing better than store bought cookies, doughnuts, brownies and pies.  Staff: English would be nice. Single request beyond drinks NEVER delivered (A1 steak sauce).  Ambiance: sun and flies. Less than considerate for mothers day and church attire. Will not return EVER."}
{"text":"I,had out of town guests and we all went to Rawhide. We ate at the steakhouse which was a huge mistake. There were 8 in our party and we were there when it was not busy at all. When our food came everyone's food was cold. We told the waiter and he got the manager who never offered to heat it up. He did ask if we wanted something else. Those that did order something else got more cold food. The manager only took off 2 of the meals and then gave us 20%off the rest of the bill. We decided to order dessert since most of us never got any food that was edible. I specifically asked for the apple crisp \"only\" if they would make sure it was served hot as it was supposed to be. Well guess what, it too was served old. They didn't seem to care that or try to bring out any food that was warm enough.  The coffee was even served cold. Please don't waste your time eating there and don't recommend Rawhide to anyone."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience in 20 years! 

My husband and I made a reservation for 8pm on 12/23. Our party of two got seated within 10 minutes and our server was prompt to take our drink order. We ordered onion rings for an appetizer, and it took 20 min. And came out cold.

At that point our server disappeared for about 30 min. We still had no entrees. When the server stopped by after another 15 min. (That's a total of 45 min. after getting our appetizer) he said that he confirmed our order was back there but there was another large party ahead of us. He had no estimate on when we would be getting our food.

Well, after another 10 min., we overhead that the big group next to us had been sitting there for over 2 hrs and still didn't have their entrees. They got up and left without paying. 

At that point we flagged down our server and told him to cancel our order and get us our check for the drinks and appetizer. We had a $5 off coupon which he said he would have to have the manager bring by in cash because their computer system could not handle it. The manager came by and gave us $5 cash. Then when the server brought back our receipt, he showed us that he was able to take the $5 off the check so he needed the $5 cash back!

We were at our table for a total of 1 1/2 hours. We have never had such a poor experience at a restaurant that we left without ever getting our entrees. 

This one goes down as our all time worst dining experience."}
{"text":"Went to Rawhide for dinner last night. We were seated at 6:15 with six other friends, the restaurant wasn't very crowded but our server didn't show up for 15 minutes. We ordered drinks which were promptly served. In a few minutes our dinner orders were taken then the wait started. Around 45 minutes later, some bread was served then our server informed us they were out of ribs which were ordered by most of us we then changed our order and some chips and dip showed up to placate us. Another 45 minutes later I asked our server where was our dinners? She told us they would be out in 5 minutes. After waiting 15 minutes longer, we asked for our check which was comped by the manager. Bottom line we waited nearly two hours and never got dinner. If you are hungry find somewhere else! This place needs new management."}
{"text":"The BEST burgers ever!  Entertainment is always a pleasure!

*Menu posted is not current...fyi*"}
{"text":"After being at Rawhide for a spell we mossy'd on over to get some grub. The kid had her usual chicken strips and I a angus burger, both very good!!! Only complaint was the long wait to go to a hardly used dinning area. I am assuming during the day they seat only as many as can be served."}
{"text":"Do not come here. For an establishment in the service industry, they were not interested in offering any quality level of service. Our group of 14 was treated with disdain soon after the first of us showed up, to the point that our waiter made us feel like a burden before we had a chance to order, and with only 8 of us there. He literally told us he was going to pass us off to another waiter because he didn't want to deal with a large party. A few basic questions about Gluten-Free alternatives were met with antagonism, and we chose to leave.

20 minutes north of here offers The Keg, Outback, or Flemings, all of which would be a much better option than this poor excuse for a service-friendly steakhouse."}
{"text":"I had a great time with my family at this place.  The food was good but the atmosphere and service were great.   I was surprised the service was so fast and friendly after reading the other yelp reviews.   Where else can you pan for gold, listen to live music, watch a wild west shoot out, and eat bull testicles? No where."}
{"text":"I recently took my father and uncle, visiting from out of town, for dinner.  Atmosphere was great, but food was ok.  We ordered the fried pickles and the coconut shrimp for appetizers.   Pickles were great, and the shrimp was also good, but very greasy.   The salad was iceberg on a plate with 2 tomatoes, 2 cucumbers, and a ton of croutons.   Never got the dinner rolls, ok though since we really didn't need them.   We ordered two prime rib dinners (medium), one rib dinner, and a NY strip medium rare.   Both orders of prime rib were very well done, and the steak was very raw.  I wanted to ask for new prime rib, but my father insisted they would eat it anyway.  If you have nothing but very well done prime rib available, at least let your guests know and give the option to order something else.  After waiting about 15 minutes, my steak was cooked longer, and was actually very good.   While my partner thought his ribs were great,  I have had better at chain restaurants.   The \"fire roasted corn on the cob\" was boiled frozen corn, and tiny.   I know corn isn't in season, but when it's clearly frozen and boiled,  at least get some decent cobs!   Maybe throw them on the grill to \"fire roast\" then.   The other sides (baked beans, mashed potatoes, and loaded baked) were average.   The entire meal lasted about 30 minutes (15 minutes for appetizer, salad,  meals,  and 15 minutes to reheat my steak)...we were rushed quicker than a McDonalds.  Sad because there were only a few tables on a Thursday night.   This establishment is obviously overpriced and not worth the money if you only rely on the food, it's a tourist trap.   You need to pay the musician, the magician, and the 20 staff members in the restaurant somehow.   Speaking of the magician, that is why this place gets the stars.  After our lackluster meal and service, he amazed us with table side magic for 10 minutes.  Sad that an awesome magician is the star of a steakhouse, rather than the food."}
{"text":"It's surprising that they are open on Thanksgiving. Considering big brand stores, department stores and restaurants are all closed so that their employees can have dinner with their families. It doesn't seem like Rawhide has any family values."}
{"text":"Rawhide was a fun experience, but after going once it doesn't seem like the type of place I would go out of my way to visit again. The gun fight shows were the best part of the town. Everything else could be passed by in a matter of minutes. The food is overpriced for the taste and quality. I'd definitely recommend eating before heading to rawhide."}
{"text":"Update.  Went to the Easter buffet and I have to say it wasn't as good of years previous.  The last time I was there is fantastic this time everyone was disappointed.  The only dessert they had was pecan pie and set a pumpkin muffin things and hard cookies. Mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese just not the same. Everything was blah and tasteless. I think many businesses wind up like this. They have a good thing going and then they start cutting corners.  When that happens the quality takes a dive."}
{"text":"I was skeptical as this place is super touristy...but I was fabulous!  We spent 3 nights at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass and took the complimentary boat ride over to Rawhide for the evening.  When walking past the Steakhouse, it appeared fairly quiet, so we didn't think to make a reservation.  When we returned, it was still quiet, but were told there wouldn't be a table for us for another 1.5 hours!  (It was almost comical as there were at least 15 tables open that we could see, but..whatever...I still killed the hostess with kindness and offered her our phone number to call...within 30 seconds of leaving she ran out and said they \"found room for us.\"  So, not the best start...but we ended up having a great time and one of the best meals of our trip!  I had the ribs and tri-tip platter and it was so big I wish I had shared it with someone.  The rattlesnake appetizer is overpriced, but hey...we ate rattlesnake...tick that one off the list.  Beers were good. Waiter was great.  Tableside magician stole the show. Overall, I would recommend this if you are in Rawhide or staying at the Wildhorse Pass.  Just make a reservation to be safe!"}
{"text":"After reading the previous review by El Jefe I'm now seething. We had reservations for 4 at 5:30 p.m. Saturday night February 13th. We arrived at Rawhide around 3 p.m. and did a tour of the town. The place was more ghost town then western town. We saw at most two dozen other patrons walking about, and the parking lot in front of Rawhide was nearly empty, at less than 1% capacity filled. By 4:30 p.m. we were hungry and decided to go to the Steakhouse and see about getting seated early. We walked in and saw that the dining room was about 5% full, and the bar was completely empty with no one in there and several more large round tables available. Great! Shouldn't be a problem. We informed the hostess we had reservations for 5:30 p.m. but hoped we might be seated an hour early, seeing as the place was practically empty. We were told by the hostess that they would not seat us early, we would have to wait until 5:30 p.m. We pointed out the fact that the dining room was nearly empty and there was no one at any of the tables in the bar. This didn't matter to her one bit, she was adamant, with all the  empathy and compassion of a robot, they were unable to seat us for another hour. We stepped away in disgust, used the restrooms and then went into the bar to discuss our options. After about 15 minutes we informed the hostess we would not wait until 5:30, cancelled our reservation and left. We saw no evidence of any new customers entering Rawhide and we left Rawhide the ghost town that it is. I can only wonder how this place manages to stay in business treating their customers this way. We will never come back."}
{"text":"Rawhide Western Town is as good as it gets if you are looking for the authentic old west town feel.  They have the Saloon, steakhouse, jail, and many shops and restaurants.  My kids loved all the rides which include wagon rides, gold panning, barrel rides, mine car roller coaster, and boat shuttle to casino.  They also have a petting zoo, live shows and gunfights too!  Let's not forget to try the fried rattlesnake...tastes just like chicken!  This is a great place to visit for locals and on vacation.

Parking cost $5 but they give you a $5 coupon for the steakhouse and its free to get in."}
{"text":"My husband, toddler and I visited on a Saturday night at about 5 pm. We didn't have reservations, but the restaurant was empty. The hostess started walking us into the saloon and I asked if we could sit in the restaurant because they had live music that night. She told us that only people with reservations can sit in the dining room. She sat us in the saloon and we waited for over 10 minutes for a server to even acknowledge us. Servers walked by our table several times, but no one even asked if we had been taken care of. 

Finally, a woman in jeans and a tank top came and took our order. When we ordered my daughter's kids meal, I asked for milk with it. I was informed that milk has to be purchased separately and that only soft drinks come with the kids meal. I told her that was ridiculous and opted to purchase milk rather than give my one year-old soda. 

Then the server walked away without asking for my husband's and my beverage orders. Our appetizer and my daughter's meal came out at the same time. I then had to flag the server down to get silverware and napkins. We were not offered side plates. Then our meals came out about three minutes later! We ended up eating our appetizer as a side dish. My husband also received the wrong steak and rather than automatically fixing the situation, the food runner asked if that was fine with him anyway. He said it was fine for the sake of convenience. When the food runner gave me my plate, she put it down in front of my daughter and shoved it across the table to me, pulling half of the table cloth along with the plate. Then she said \"ow ow ow\" as if the plate was hot. It most definitely was not hot. 

All of our condiments and side dishes came in plastic take-out ramekins - with lids on them as if we were going to take them home instead of eating there. The food itself was decent - my husband ended up with the New York strip (not what he ordered) and I had the prime rib. The kids Mac and cheese, however, was greasy, globby and it came with a fair amount of pepper on top. She barely ate any of it so I asked our server for a to-go box. She came back with a styrofoam cup and shoved it into the cup, writing \"Mac n cheese\" in purple pen on the side. 

She did offer us a free dessert for the mistake with the steak order. However, she just brought out an apple crisp in a disposable tin baking pan- we didn't get to choose or to indicate a food allergy if that had been the case. 

I also never saw a full dining room or even heard live music anyway. I'll also add that the bathroom was less than clean. Made me cringe to have my toddler in there with me. This place has absolutely zero ambience. Servers from the forbidden dining room had western wear on, but they were hanging out in the saloon to watch the sports scores on the TVs. Kind of killed the mood. 

I filled out a comment card, but have not received any acknowledgement. Seeing that no one has responded to the reviews on here, I'm not expecting one."}
{"text":"We had Easter brunch here and they did a really good job when it came to seating and making sure everything went off smoothly.  All the staff we encountered were super nice.  It is not a 5 star by any means, but it was a fun environment.  We ate our brunch listening to a live country band playing and we walked around a bit outside but didn't do any of the activities so I cannot review those.  They seemed appropriate for small kids.  I would go back for brunch."}
{"text":"1 star knocked from first impression /host stand .

Both hostesses were very odd and cold . Asked for a booth twice ( only one at the time being used ) was told no . The table we were sat at was wobbly ( asked for it to be fixed ) hostess did not come back .

Told the waiter I wanted a booth and the table was wobbly . But the looks of it the host staff might have gave him alittle trouble moving us . But he was able to move us ! ( literally 7 feet away )

Food was very good ! And came out crazy fast ! 
We will return and I will make sure booth is in the RVSP and hope host staff is not rude again !!
Hope management sees this review ."}
{"text":"We were a party of 5 on Friday night, celebrating two birthdays.  I was a little reluctant to go here given the reviews, which is why I am leaving this one.  The restaurant was a little over half full, so maybe this is why we had a terrific experience.  We ordered the rattlesnake appetizer, meatloaf, sliders and pulled pork.   Our waiter was efficient, friendly and everything came out quickly and was hot.   The country band was fun and people were dancing and the band sang happy birthday.  They also brought us ice cream sundaes for our birthdays.   Overall, we had a fun time and I thought the value was great."}
{"text":"Made reservation for 5 pm, promptly seated.  Ordered rattle snake appetizer.  Menu stated, rattle snake,  Boa Constrictor, and Python,  all mixed together in metal bowl, with chips and sauce surrounding it.  Snake meat was no larger than a dime, and it was breaded, for 22 dollars it was a huge disappointment.  Ordered New York Strip Steak, 3 cheese macaroni, and garlic mashed potatoes.  Steak was good, side dishes were a joke.  Macaroni and mashed potatoes served in a cup, much smaller than a coffee cup.  Got to be kidding me, served on huge plate that was 70 % empty.   Side dishes got cold in 5 minutes, metal cup helped.  Mrs had 2 alcoholic beverages with dinner, cost 32 dollars, really  ?  Had extremely loud group of 20 two tables away from us, screaming and shouting for about 40 minutes while some man performed magic tricks for them.  I gave this place a one star, only for my steak, and the service was good.  Never again."}
{"text":"The steak here was was awesome!   We tried the filet and the New York strip.   They were both cooked perfectly and were super tender.  The kids loved their meals as well.   We had fun dancing to the live music before our food arrived, although we did not have long because our meal came quick!   Fast, frendly service."}
{"text":"Took my family to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  Upon arrival at the table we got a visit from a young man doing amazing magic tricks.  My Grandchildren came away thrilled.  The room they seated us in did not seem to be that busy but they had a great crowd.  The band playing was great.  Sadly the service and the food left something to be desired.  The children's meals seemed to be eaten but the meals for the five adults left something to be desired.  My Filet was cold and very dry, the baked potato was small and also cold.   Maybe just an off night?  Don't see us going back for the lack of service and the quality of the food.  I certainly did not get my money's worth $250.00 bill."}
{"text":"Terrible!  Their most expensive steak is a 14oz  ribeye that is about 1/4\" thick and regardless of how you order it,  expect it to come out well done.  We ordered medium and medium-rare but after sending back the first order,  we realized it was no-win.  The salad bar was okay but the sides were very average.  Even with a Groupon,  this was not worth it.   Will not go back.  Friday night and the place was like a ghost town.  Should have been the first sign we'd be disappointed"}
{"text":"1st time here. we got in without reservations and where seated quickly. My wife ordered a salmon dinner and it came out cooked to purification! I ordered a sage fried chicken witch was amazing.  Now out to checkout the old west town"}
{"text":"There is not much to do here. A few animals in their \"petting zoo\" and a couple of shows. There is a bounce house and shooting game. We were there on Saturday of a holiday weekend and there weren't more than 50 people. It was empty and dull. The food at the steakhouse was enjoyable, nothing special but had a nice band. Seems like a place going out of business. 
If you want a fun experience of the old west visit Goldfield Ghost Town in Apache Junction. It's SO worth the short drive."}
{"text":"We had dinner this easter-weekend at Rawhide. Our experience does not match with the other comments here. We did experience very friendly service, were serviced timely, the food was excellent. The beer recommendation was great.
No complaints, we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Well, I was quite surprised by our meal tonight at the steakhouse.  Service was good, but the sage crusted chicken was like a child's portion.  Baked potato was cold as were the mashed potatoes on our other order.  They gave one small piece of chicken.  When we order the chicken before, they gave 2 large, thick pieces.  When asked what happened, we were told, it was the chiefs decision to cut down the portion to be more profitable.  Poor, poor decision as they just lost two good customers.  I also would not recommend the steakhouse to any one nor will I bring my out-of-town guest there.  We did speak to the manager and he told us the same thing.  Bad decisions by the chief, because if they keep cutting the portions down, they won't have to worry about being profitable, there will no customers and they will be out of business.  Too bad, the chief ruined the restaurant."}
{"text":"This Steakhouse needs a lot of work. Definitely some opportunities for.improvement in the service department.... Particularly the wait staff and hostess. The food was satisfactory at best. Most likely will not return for the steakhouse."}
{"text":"We came and had dinner on a Saturday night at 5, our first warning sign should've been how dead it was. We had a table of 13 and got sat right away. Our server was amazing and was very friendly and prompt. There was a huge price discrepancy on their family meal ($15 cheaper online) and our server went above and beyond to find a solution. I honestly think if we had any other server we would've walked. Our order took over an hour to come out, and when it did almost all of if was over cooked. The smoked chicken was bone dry, the pulled pork was rubbery, ribs were burnt and our kids hamburgers were hockey pucks. The kids mac and cheese was one huge glob of grease and noodles! The atmosphere was loud due to the \"musician\" turning up the volume on his keyboard. All in all it wasn't a pleasant experience and I don't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Howdy Cowpokes!

Western themed town just outside of south Phoenix and chandler Arizona...

Cool live music and friendly entertaining staff do their best to amuse you. 

Our little blonde waitress Melanie was friendly and nice. 

We got a monster sized bowl of steakhouse chili for $7 that was huge and good!

Good T-Bone steaks and sweet potato fries with some sweeeet ice as tea.

Stop in for a good night..."}
{"text":"Awful. Took 10 minutes to see a sign of a bartender. Ordered a steak. Steak tasted like the cook grilled up a patty of ground beef well done. My side of mash potatoes came in a plastic to-go cup with a lid (this wasn't a to-go order)... and to top it off the pen they gave me to sign my bill and tip them with had no ink. 

Here's a tip... get new management now cause this place won't survive."}
{"text":"My family has visited Rawhide on previous occasions and always had a good time.  We were celebrating my son's birthday and we decided to go to Rawhide since my great granddaughters (aged 1 and 3) were going also. We thought they would have fun at the attractions there with the petting zoo etc.  We were there at 5:30 and not many people there. We went to see what was in the petting zoo. All we could see was a Turkey, a chicken and a bird. It cost $5 for an adult and kids three and under free. We decided it wasn't worth it so we walked back towards the restaurant hoping there would be something for the kids to see on the way. Nothing was open. We finally decided we were just going to have dinner. The dining room was near empty. They told us the wait was two hours!!! There was hardly anyone there and maybe two couples behind us. They said the had people with reservations but the place was empty. Will never go back to Rawhide. It was a waste of time. We ended up going to Outback and had a great meal and a great time."}
{"text":"We had a blast!  rawhide was so fun. This place is cheesy and brought me right back to my childhood.  I absolutely loved it. We had dinner ( with a country western band and huge yummy BBQ food )  then went to ride the bull.  We met awesome people and the folks that work there are so fun and nice.  Id go back in a second. So worth going!!!!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed we had Filet Mignon and Prime Rib.  No taste at all and very dry.  They took extra time to get a beer.  The server did not help that much.  This was our first meal ever and we eat out alot."}
{"text":"While in Phoenix we were told about the steaks and food here and decided to take a look. We told that we might need reservations but when we got there just walked right in the door. The place is open and can get a bit noisy when your sitting and trying to enjoy the music from the stage.

We ordered ribs and a hamburger. As it turned out some of the menu items were not available on a Sunday night for crying out loud. 

The ribs were large and meaty but a bit tough to chew on. The wife felt the hamburger was pretty good. 

All in all the experience was ok."}
{"text":"While the food and entertainment were good and a pleasant surprise - the service was so unbelievably horric it ruined our whole experience.  We went for dinner - 2 adults and 2 kids.  It took over 55 minutes to get a kids grilled cheese!  Our appetizer was served to us twice.  We brought up how long our meal was taking at least twice - and I was told *a manager will come over to talk with you and perhaps make an adjustment*.  We let our server know we wanted to make the 8pm show (our reservations were at 6:30pm).  Didn't order anything complicated that I thought we would be able to make it.  Guess what - after 35 minutes from being told mgr would come over - they never did.  Clearly - they didn't really care.  Finally - my husband and kids left to go see the show - we weren't able to finish our dinner - had to have our dessert wrapped up.  Server then said - you can always call us and we can try to make right by you?  I'm like - really - I get to spend more time giving feedback vs. you've now had 2 opportunities (both you and your manager) - to make this right when I am right here and you didn't think it was important enought?  And the best - kids meals include drinks - they charged us $3 EACH for a kiddy cocktail.  NEVER diclosed that was an upcharge.  

It was our first experience at Rawhide overall - and we were having a fantastic time - as we really had no idea what to expect and the kids loved it!  Our dinner experience completely ruined that - which is really a shame."}
{"text":"This place has a long way to go before they measure up to what they were when located on Scottsdale Road. Took out-of-town friends there - so disappointed in the Steakhouse, we skipped the rest of the place."}
{"text":"What saved this place from getting 1 star was Cali, our waiter. She was so amazing & sweet. Everything about this place just wasn't right I reckon.  I ordered the filet mignon & let me tell ya'll- no amount of A1 was going to help make it taste better. My husband ordered the beef ribs- honey, all I saw was a lot of ribs & no meat on them!  So, what management can do is thank Cali & give her a raise because she is the only reason why I did not give this here eatery 1 star."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. But the service was terrible. I'm visiting here, but if I lived here in AZ, I'd never be back."}
{"text":"We tried Rawhide for their Thanksgiving all you can eat buffet and we were impressed! All meats served (turkey, pork, beef roast, steak) were seasoned and cooked (smoked or grilled) beautifully; we loved most of the sides (mashed potatoes, stuffing, veg, rolls, gravy) ; the salad bar was simple but included shrimp and delicious sauce and dressings; the cookies, pie and brownies were to die for-- I still crave the brownies! We walked in and were seated immediately on the patio and the weather was beautiful. The server was very attentive and refreshed our included sodas regularly. We look forward to bringing the extended family next year!"}
{"text":"We were at the Town and wanted to try the Steak house. Oh my goodness! The food was amazing and so plentiful! I got the Tri Tip and I couldn't believe how tender and it taste so good. I could have split it with someone. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I try to be extremely lenient when it comes to service especially on the weekends because places tend to be busier. However this started when we even tried to make a reservation. Over the phone it seemed as though the restaurant would be packed all night long because we were told \"you can't add anymore guests to your reservation or else we won't be able to accommodate them.\" Fine, fair enough we figured they were very busy.

We were shocked upon walking in and counting DOZENS of empty tables. We had a reservation for 8 PM, and arrived promptly at 8. We were told we had to wait to set up the table (isn't that a point of a reservation?) we ended up waiting almost 20 minutes just to be sat at the same table we stared at from the waiting area that was already set up. 

Then comes the service (or lack there of) 10 minutes to take drink orders, 10 minutes to take appetizer orders, about 40 minutes to even take our dinner order, another 40 minutes just for dinner to come out.... etc etc my prime rib wasn't medium like I ordered it was actually more rare than medium rare. However terrified I would have to wait another hour to get a properly cooked piece of meat I said nothing. Meals are ridiculously overpriced for what you get in both quality and portion.

We had to ask for a to go box 3 times, finally someone else brought one out. Checks were a hot mess, and then the mandatory gratuity added on was icing on the cake. Our waitress made bank in tips off our table for really not doing a damn thing when the restaurant wasn't even half full. 

VERY disappointing, they only got an extra star for the magician who was great!"}
{"text":"The steak was more skirt steak than anything.  I normally share with my 4yr old but he was able to finish my entire plate. I suggest skipping the steakhouse I'm heading down for the grill"}
{"text":"Leaving dinner disappointed and offended. I tried to book make a reservation on Open Table as requested by the website. Saturday night was blocked out and when I called they stated it was because they tried to block out Mothers day and the Saturday before was blocked out instead. The young lady was very accommodating on the phone and booked our reservation. I also let her know that we were celebrating a birthday. When we arrived we stood in a line. The restaurant did not open until 5 so everyone had to wait in a line until the hostess turned a sign around stating they were open. Once seated we ordered our dinners. Then a magician came right over. This was great as it kept my 5 and 2 year olds busy until dinner arrived. He finished up as dinner arrived and then stood there awkwardly waiting for a tip. We don't carry much cash on us so we put together a couple bucks and when he saw it was ones said \"nevermind, just keep it\". 
When we ordered dinner my husband ordered a beer, he never received it. Our kids ordered cheeseburgers. When they started to eat them both girls took the meat out and just ate the buns. When we tried the meat it tasted lime freezer burned hamburger. No wonder they would not eat it. They tasted awful. 
We finished dinner and asked about ice cream. We were told they had cinnamon but there were other flavors in the general store. They never mentioned my mothers birthday even thought we told them when we made the reservation and they asked again when we were seated. 
Overall it was a very disappointing experience. What we hoped to be a fin birthday celebration left us leaving with bad taste in our mouth. Literally."}
{"text":"Pros: the entertainment and atmosphere is  I had a band playing the night over there plenty of room to dance. 
Cons: we ordered prime rib and it was about 40% fat then they bought us a ribeye steak and it had no flavor at all. The ribs were overcooked and very salty. The rattlesnake appetizer was very small for $18. We were very disappointed with the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food and entertainment were excellent!!!  Will definitely go again.  Price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"First time here since it was in Scottsdale. Over 10 years! So I heard that they moved and was never closed so i decided to take my family out to dinner. Looked online and read all reviews and decided to make a reservation as some reviews said they were never received. When we parked we were charged $5.00 for a special event. We were given a $5.00 coupon for the restaurant. Got there promptly at our reservation time and the chaos in the front with the staff was mind boggling. Nobody knew what the other was doing. Everybody was confused and the lobby was packed! The cashier kept yelling out *I NEED SOME HELP HERE PLEASE* to deaf ears. Poor lady, felt bad for her. But after waiting 20 minutes, it was our turn. She was lovely and seated us at our requested table. The Music was fun; a One Man Band was our entertainment. He was delightful. The time it took to get our food took about 45 minutes. The waiter kept coming and apologizing to us because it was taking so long. He said they ran out of prime ribs and had to get more. He then delivered some chips and salsa on the house due to the wait for our dinners. That was really nice. I ordered my prime rib med-well and it came out almost not cooked at all. I would have liked it to have come out the way I ordered it, it was NOT how I ordered it. Very raw and pink. But I did not complain and have it sent back because I didn't want to make a fuss and after almost an hour waiting and I was hungry. Over-all, we had a good evening. Its fun family time and this was great! Kids loved it and over-all we were a happy bunch."}
{"text":"This place is totally adorable. It was in a Fodor's book I bought for my Phoenix family and my mom recalled going to the old Rawhide in Chandler many many years ago. So of course we had to visit for an updated visit!
The minimum amount anyone pays is $5/vehicle for parking. Since we were just a few days after Christmas, the lights and decorations were still up. It was such a cool feeling walking on the dust street past the old buildings, underneath the lights as the sun went down past the mountains. 
I thought there would be more cowboys/gals walking along the street, but my guess is they hold them back for the paid-only show. Be prepared to pay for the attractions. I got a personalized horseshoe from the blacksmith which goes well with my Colts decor in part of my abode, it was only $10."}
{"text":"We ordered the 16 oz T-bone, steakhouse chili and jalapeño bites.


The bowl of chili was huge! And it was only $7 it has real steak bites in it and there was a lot! By the time we finished our appetizers we were already full! 

The steak was delicious, it had a really good flavor! 

Our servers name was Melanie and she was really nice.. It was a busy night because there were a lot of big tables, but she handled it really well."}
{"text":"Visited Rawhide with bestie. It was a perfect opportunity to finally try rawhide  since I had a groupon. We both had the burgers and fries.  To be honest the burger was ok and the fries were crispy. The positives- seems like  it's could be fun place to visit with the saloon/bar and shops but it was was kinda slow on the day we went. Return factor is low."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I had a hard time finding it because 1. When we tried to call it went to their corporate number, which then told us to go online, so I couldn't get a live person. 2. It's in the middle of nowhere. I had no idea it was structured like that and came over-dressed wearing heels. We ordered the food and it was delicious. Everything was tasty and fresh but I do have to say my burger was a bit greasy. The corona I ordered tasted weird and flat so I just ordered another drink. Never in my life did I taste a corona that tasted so weird, strange as hell. The service was nice the waiter checked in on us. The live music was relaxing. The things outside are ok I guess. I couldn't really walk so I wasn't able to explore since I was wearing $100 heels. The stars are for the food and the environment of the restaurant. Please fix your phones. When we told the guys at the front fable they go \"Oh really? That's weird someone else said the same thing and we were wondering why the phones are not ringing\" I'm like really?? So why didn't you fix it there were like 6 tables booked and it didn't make you wonder that the phones could have done it?"}
{"text":"RUDE SERVICE, POOR TRAINING: I LOVE Arizona and Rawhide, but the Steakhouse and Saloon in the park turned my family away. The hostess said we needed reservations, but the restaurant was practically empty, and when we asked if she could fit us in, she said in the most aloof tone \"No.\" Not \"I'm sorry\", \"I apologize,\" simply \"No\". It literally taints the whole park, which is really a shame. Just seemed really bad business practice. We were prepared to spend some real cash, too. The food might be great, for all I know, but the service is unbelievably poor. I don't like restaurants that treat their customers like replaceable objects. Wish I could give this place a zero for the same amount of service that I received. If I owned this place, I'd be REALLY upset! Table for seven, and you turn us away because you're full? Oh wait, the restaurant is completely empty! Lol How stupid can you be?!! Though, judging from the reviews, they might've done us a favor! This place really needs new management. ABSOLUTELY INEXCUSABLE!"}
{"text":"While attending a private function a group went into the widow maker bull riding activity. Everyone was having a good time drinking and whooping it up. The guy who operated the riding bull machine told a lady she had to leave the bar because she was inappropriate.  This is what happened. The operator said take off your shoes, your jewelry,your jacket. She said go ahead take off your shirt while your at it. There was only adults in this place and it was a private party and she wasn't even serious. I don't know what this guys problem was but he should not be around drinking adults having a good time."}
{"text":"Closed to private event. No notification on website. Along with that, half the attractions we're closed to private events. It probably would have been fun."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is average, band was ok.  I had the 3 meat item.  All three where subpar at best. Tri-tip was rubbery.  Ribs were just flat out terrible.  Pulled pork was super wet, almost like it sat in water.  I should have known something was wrong when all three came drenched in BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Kinda secluded and hard to find. The GPS didn't even want to direct us here...maybe that should have been a sign we should rearrange our plans for meal time. We found it, though...unfortunately. We were excited to try the steakhouse because the menu was so tantalizing and the website got us so excited with anticipation. Maybe that was the problem. We get there and the FOUR women working the hostess stand make a huge to-do because they can't find our reservation for THREE people. I am thinking, well this must be good because they must be booked solid so people must love this joint.\" Nope. They seat us and upon walking into the restaurant, I am not even kidding you when I tell you there was ONE table of people among at least 75 booths and tables. See pictures! Unbelievable. The place was completely empty and they looked around for a reservation for five minutes. I called three different times the week before and left messages for the steakhouse. No one called me back. I finally went online and made the stupid reservation, not that you need one anyway. Anyway, food was pretty gross. Salad bar looked like the selections were at least one week old. Discolored carrots and bell peppers and some really nasty looking tuna and potato salad. The best part was the cheap little dinner rolls. Pretty sad."}
{"text":"We've made a reservation to come here on a Friday night right before heading to the light show nearby. BIG MISTAKE! 

We arrived 10 minutes before 6p.m. that night. Even with lots of tables available, they made us wait until exactly 6p.m. before sitting us. Not a big deal. Then, we seat for another 10 minutes before anyone noticed us. Since they were so busy that night, our waiter wanted us to order our food right then and there. Not a problem. We understand. Needless to say, our main entrée did not arrive until an hour later. Yes, you heard me right. It was exactly an hour. What made me furious was this - I order a prime rib medium rare and it came in almost completely cooked. 

It clearly wasn't our water's fault that the kitchen wasn't doing their jobs. Even the manager came over to apologize and gave us a free appetizer. I notified the waiter that my steak was not to my liking, but I was too hungry to wait for another one. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 star is because the manager felt bad and comp us on my meal. The music was so loud we couldn't even talk to each other without screaming. Overall, it was a horrible experience. 

I will never come back here again. It literally ruined my Friday night."}
