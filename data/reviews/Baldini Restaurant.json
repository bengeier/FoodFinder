{"text":"Clearly this is a love it or leave kind of place. I think I'll leave it. We went for brunch this weekend while we were in the neighbourhood. Marmalade & OK Diner had line-ups then we walked by this place. The brunch menu drew us in. 

Inside, it looked like a cozy Italian diner which is good. It looked clean & the washroom is on the main floor. The menu had a great selection. The prices were reasonable. 

Now you are wondering if I made a mistake with the one star......?

Let's see...BOTH of our glasses of water had brown bits that I didn't notice until half way through. It doesn't end there. After waiting for a while, the waitress (who I think was still drunk - I was too so who am I to judge?) asked again what we had ordered. We told her again & then 5 minutes  later she brought us the food for someone else. Then when out food came, she tried to give it to the next table. Then more people started to come in. 

I gave my bacon to my honey and he didn't get it. The scrabbled eggs were a bit runny. 

After ready the revues, maybe they should just stick to Italian lunch and dinner?

**try the dinner & skip the brunch**"}
{"text":"Average, but cozy. Good service.

Holiday Monday dinner, so the small restaurant wasn't crowded yet still had a light stream of business - both in house and take-out. We had:
- Gamberi Limone (grilled shrimp on baby spinach salad w/ garlic crostini)
- Spaghetti Bolongese (meat and mushroom sauce)
- Risotto Pescatore (seafood)

The shrimp were overcooked, some hadn't been completely deveined near the pesky tail end, and the salad might've been a touch overseasoned. My dining partner commented that it was a bit on the sour side, and wasn't sure what one of the dressing ingredients was - I ventured a tapenade by the looks of it. The spaghetti was nice and al dente, but I found the sauce a little too salty to be fully balanced. In comparison the risotto was almost bland, but it had a nice seafood flavour to it. It had mini scallops, two each of shrimp and calamari, and a scattering of little mussels (not clams).

Service:
Good. We seated and served water and bread right away, and had constant top-ups of hot water without having to ask. The one server (manger/owner?) was very attentive and had good timing."}
{"text":"Was using up my expiring voucher again with my gf (seems to be a trend for me). We arrived to Leslieville area! Not a usual place for us to hang, but it is quite a peaceful area. When we arrived for dinner it was quite late around 9pm on monday. We were basically the only ones there dining. It felt very uneasy and awkward.

We have the Groupon voucher that allows two apps,two pasta, two mains, one dessert to share and conveniently it was part of their menu on the back special for two ppl.

Apps we selected: Marinated calamari grilled Charred tomato salsa, capers, kalamata olives and balsamic reduction served on organic greens 

and Herb encrusted baked goat cheese, grilled eggplant on baby mixed green & balsamic syrup

- The calamari was good size pieces and was a good app.
- Mine I enjoyed the goat cheese, but everything else was just okay.

Pasta we selected: One of each. One was penne with rose sauce and bacon leeks. The other was stuff agnolotti with ricota cheese and butternut squash.
- Both were okay. Nothing special about these dish.

Entrees we selected: AAA Grilled fillet mignon & black tiger shrimps in a Madagascar peppercorns Barolo wine and Panko crusted bass served with lemon herb balsimico
Both are served with some greens and yukon potatoes.

- I have to say that my filet mignon was cooked right, but it was the smallest medallion size I have witness. Imagine eating a seared scallop size meat. The shrimp did not seem like 'tiger shrimp potential'. 

My gf dish was alright as well. The fish tasted a bit sour and off to us but we didn't wanna say anything...

Dessert we selected: Maple syrup cream caramel. This reminded me of a dessert I ate at Mandarin Buffet which is not good at all. Overly sweet and the dessert was just not appetizing. Good thing we had a few courses or snack prior to this dessert.

Prob would not dine here again, b/c its quite boring to eat at a small place.However, if you do enjoy the intimate candle light small table dinner, this is a place for you."}
{"text":"Seriously underrated restaurant in Leslieville.  I almost never think of it when trying to come up with dinner ideas but tonight someone did and the choice was unanimous.  We shared the grilled calamari and the carpaccio and they were both perfectly delicious. As was the bread we used to sop up what was left of the balsamic glaze that accompanied them.

I had the filet mignon and it was tender and delicious in a Barolo wine sauce over mixed vegetables.  Really really tasty.  The lamb special and the seafood linguine went over equally well with my dinner companions.  The portion sizes were generous, the prices, while not cheap, were reasonable (dinner for three with a bottle of wine for $100), and the service was wonderful.  There were lots of patrons that seemed to be regulars, always a good sign.  I may well become one of them."}
{"text":"I've dined her x2 to date. Overall a warm relaxing restaurant with well cooked food. Unfortunately however, when I last ate here the bread basket was full of green mouldy bread. When we pointed this out to server there was minimal apology and our replacement bread basket also had mouldy bread. Come on guys....bread? Get it right!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here last week.  We started with the antipasto then I  had the surf and turf special and my girlfriend had the Veal Lamone.  Very delicious.  Great atmosphere and the server couldn't have been nicer and helpful. We will be going back again and again"}
{"text":"Portions were very generous. Food was great. Service was excellent. 
The waiters were very knowledgeable and accommodating. 
All four of us left feeling full and extremly satisfied."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place a full 4 star, but after two visit, the same issues prevent me from giving this place more than a 3.5. 

The food portion was generous and well executed.  We found the food delicious on both visit and enjoyed all the dishes we ordered.  

Both times we ate outside of the busy dinner rush, but the service was a bit slow.  The server was doing the best he could, but looking after the whole restaurant may be a bit too much for him to handle.  

The one item that really annoyed me on both visit was the fruit flies that circled the table on both occassion.  It was really hard to enjoy my meal when i am constantly swapping flies away from my food, wine and bread."}
{"text":"After posting the below review, I got a very apologetic response from the owner who seemed genuinely shocked at what occurred on my last visit. He made me a generous offer enticing me to return and so myself and my bf went back on Friday (unfortunately my mum, the victim of the previous review, couldn't make it.)
 
We had a lovely meal. Our server, Kyle was incredibly knowledgeable and passionate and seemed to really love doing his job. We were served hot, fresh bread to start with (and offered another basket after we finished!) and our water was constantly refilled without us having to ask. My boyfriend ordered the pork special and absolutely loved it. I didn't sample any but both the description and look of the dish (stuffed with cheese in a red wine reduction, served with veg) was mouth-watering. I had a simple margherita pizza and it was delicious. The crust was thin and the dough was light - I didn't have that awful full/bloated pizza feeling afterwards. The tomatoes were served in large juicy slices - this was a nice authentic change from the tomatoes being purreed and pasted blandly into the cheese, which is what usually happens.
 
Our visit on Friday brought Baldini's back up in my estimation. I'm willing to believe that the mussel incident was a one-off. I was very impressed by the owner's desire to rectify the situation and I believe him when he says that he visited the kitchen and spoke to the staff after my complaint.
 
For those who haven't visited, the atmosphere and d√©cor of this restaurant is very romantic and relaxing and a nice change from the louder, noisier, hipstery places nearby. The menu manages to be expansive and varied while still being true to its Italian roots, and while prices have increased recently, they are still very reasonable.
 
This is the review I probably should have written on my first visit a couple of years ago."}
{"text":"Baldini surprisingly took a reservation for 16 for my birthday considering the entire restaurant probably seats about 30 people. They have one waiter, one busboy, and a chef.

The first thing I noticed is that it seems like they have been doing this a long time. The service is impeccable - friendly and down-to-earth, but very knowledgeable about the menu and helpful with the wine list. The waiter even used the kitschy, massively over-sized pepper grinder for our amusement.

The food was solid, traditional Italian. My date and I shared the carpaccio to start, which I have to admit was only okay. It was supposed to be pepper-encrusted, but the flavour could have used some more punch. For the main I had calabrese con rapini, which was excellent. The flavour combination was executed much better in this dish and paired well with the penne (I love getting sauce explosions from inside the pasta).

Almost everyone in the party of reduced-to-14 thoroughly enjoyed their meals.

Overall the experience was great. I highly recommended Baldini if you're looking for traditional Italian fare with the accompaniment of great service in a comfortable, cozy setting."}
{"text":"Perfect service and food is good. I'll definitely  return there. The staff will provide you with all attention"}
{"text":"I made a dinner reservation for 6 people for an early birthday celebration. I called in yesterday and was hoping to add more guests. This person picked up the phone and asked me to hold for over 20 minutes. Left me hanging while I can hear everything going on on their end. I figured just be patience but after so long I couldn't wait any longer. I even asked a friend to tried calling while I was waiting and of course they didn't pick up. After hanging up and calling right back I got a busy tone so I waited a minute and tried again. The same person picked up so I decided to cancel my reservation. No apologies, no nothing. Quite upsetting considering I was looking forward to enjoying a nice evening with my group of friends. I guess my friends and I will never know how the food would be. It's just too bad this happened. Sorry but not sorry!"}
{"text":"Went to Baldini for a work lunch with 5 in my party. We ordered 3 x paninis with soup and 2 x risotto dishes. The soup was good - butternut squash and sweet potato - a little heavy on the pepper but seasoned well otherwise. I had the chicken panini and it was good; nothing to rave about but good. 

There was one slip up - the server forgot to put in 2 risotto dishes and the 2nd came after everyone else was finished eating. She did offer a complimentary desert though.

Decent - but not the best you can find on the block."}
{"text":"Me and my significant other come here quite a bit (about once every 2-3 weeks) for dinner. We both love it. Kyle is an amazing server and always has our wine ready. The atmosphere is cozy, the food is delicious. I cannot say enough good things about Baldini's. The only recommendation i would have is to shrink the menu so there aren't so many options. But irrelevant - the food is great. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The BEST meal I've had in a long time. My bolognese was sublime. My partner's steak was the best he has ever had. I had a bite and it was truly wonderful. My only complaint is that the tables are too close together, so it can be awkward/uncomfortable at times."}
{"text":"Great service. Great pasta. The restaurant gives you the feel of an 80's fine dining restaurant. Dark, cozy.  It is a very small restaurant and the staff seem to know their customers well. I had a vodka tomato pasta with pancetta. The minestrone was probably one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised by all of the positive reviews.  ... unless you're saying, it's nice for what it is.  It's a nice restaurant in a sketchy area.  Lesliville is up and coming, this is where it is coming up from.   The decor is boring and old, shelves are leaning, and the tables are much too close together.   The server was preparing sugar snap peas at one of the tables / serving us & handling menus.  Asian symbols on the pillows with Italian words on the walls. meh, that's not what ranks this as 2 stars....


The food!  blah!

Beef carpacio, like a 7-11 taco... overcooked on the outside and frozen in the middle.  It tasted closer to roast beef than to the fresh beef it should.  To their credit (/sarcasm), I was given a do-over, which was exactly the same: with the suggest that I \"let it sit and thaw for a few minutes because it sits under the compressor, so freezes a bit too much, but this is necessar to cut it so thin\" - rediculous.  I understand you want to chill it to firm it up before slicing, but the pieces weren't thin at all, it was frozen so that biting into the middle was closer to biting into cheap ice cream.   The second round was also missing the proper garnish. As for the over cooking - the pieces were falling apart and grey for about 1/2cm around the edge.  I mixed it up with my greens and just got it over with.

On to the main - the filet mignon - poorly trimmed, and served medium when ordered rare.  The mashed potatoes on the side were lumpy.  And the large piece of pepper right on top had a large blemish on it (Not a grill mark!) where something in the garden had taken a nibble. On the up-side, the flavours were decent and balanced.

The baked goat cheese was pretty tasty, though over-seasoned, and my partner enjoyed the spaghetti bolognese.  

Dessert was ok, a slice of cake from the cooler, with some watery raspberry drizzle.

So like I said, this is nice for what it is.  An up-scale dive Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and tried this restaurant based on Yelp reviews. This is a neighborhood gem! Started with a fantastic bruschetta that was soo good! The tomatoes were fresh and the bread was both crispy and soft...perfect! The Chicken Supreme was AMAZING! Stuffed with prosciutto & provolone and  a pommery mustard sauce paired with mashed potatoes and veggies...soo good!  I was stuffed but couldn't pass up the carmel brownie cheesecake which was fantastic! Wish this place was in my hometown! I can't remember the last meal I had that was this good! Kyle our server was amazing as well! Great find!"}
{"text":"After all the positive reviews on yelp we tried Baldini's for lunch on friday (first went to queen margarehita but with no air con and rude staff left).

I wish i could say that lunch was fantastic but it was MEH.   The pizza was the Carne it was overwhelming with the smoke bacon and unfortunately that's the only taste it had.  The penne pasta with rapini and chilli flakes, was bland.  It had only one piece of rapini chopped & way overcooked.  The sauce was very oily.  I asked for chicken to be added, it was rubbery.  

We asked if they had any vodka coolers and the waiters response was \"people don't order those here\".  Duh we did.  Service was ok will give that one star.

The other star is for the quaint room.  Very old school bistro.  

$60 for lunch tax and tip in. (2 Ceasars)"}
{"text":"I went to Baldini's for my birthday dinner with the fam. They had been there before and highly recommended it. It's a super small place but sports a great atmosphere and some great food. For an app I had the goat cheese with spices, eggplant and arugula which was amazing. For a main I had the seabass which was on special that night. The dish came with a good amount of fish as well as some linguini in a simple sauce. Everything worked very well together, was spiced nicely (not too much) and I was very pleased.  We also ordered the house wine which was smooth and really nice.

Overall I highly recommend it, the service was good, the food was excellent and the atmosphere quant."}
{"text":"East-end gem! Great selection of seafood, meat, pizza and pasta dishes. Started with the CROSTINI MOUSSE (chicken liver pate on crisp baguette) which was delicious. GAMBERI LIMONE (buttery tiger shrimp on a bed of mixed greens) were a bit overcooked but very tasty. The ANTIPASTO (for 2) is a generous portion and beautifully presented (the grilled calamari was cooked perfectly!).  CAESAR salad was the only disappointment - lettuce was limp and yellowish and croutons were hard as stone, but the dressing was quite nice.  

SPAGHETTINI CARBONARA was VERY rich and very tasty.  BOLOGNESE was a generous portion with a thick meaty sauce.  Pasta in both dishes was cooked perfectly al dente. Star of the evening was the SPINACH GNOCCI: was surprised that it came in a rose sauce rather than a white cream sauce, but it was delicious!  With a sprinkle of parmesan, fresh black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil from the table, no wonder it's listed as a 'house specialty.' Side of rapini was very small/expensive (menu says $3 but on the bill we were charged $4 for a few tiny stalks).

For dessert, we had an Americano (very good coffee!) and the panna cotta which was another smash hit. Best panna cotta I've had in several years!

Service was friendly and attentive. Found this place through Groupon and love how flexible the options are. With the groupon, you can either opt for the Prix Fixe menu OR order from the regular menu and have the value of the groupon applied against the bill.  Interior is small and intimate. Would definitely eat here again if ever in the Queen East neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Really cute place, smells amazing the moment you walk in. Have been here a few times and have always been happy with the quality of food."}
{"text":"I rate it 4 star even my main course,  grilled salmon, was horrible. The salmon was ok nothing extraordinary, but the pasta was way way wayyyyy too salty. I thought of telling my waitress but she was extremely busy the entire time we were there. I wasn't too upset about it because I shared all the courses with my dear friend and her order of grilled stuffed chicken was superb. .... also, the appetizers, salad and grilled calamali were both amazing. Our desserts, tiramisu and especially the sherbet with mango were also champions. So yes 4 stars even I was not pleased with my entre. I would love to go back for second time as well."}
{"text":"My boss took me and two coworkers here for a nice dinner. He had also purchased a Groupon that he used for this occasion. The service was great and it wasn't too busy. The ambiance in the restaurant is very nice.

We got a bottle of red wine to share and started with soups/salads. I got the Caesar salad which wasn't anything special. As my main I got the Sicilian Gnocchi and I really enjoyed this dish. Gnocchi is something I must try at any Italian restaurant and this one was delicious. The men both got the surf and turf and seemed to enjoy it. My other coworker got the penne Verde and she liked it.

Overall, the experience was fine, dinner was good, and I'm glad I got to eat here."}
{"text":"I don't like to give bad reviews. But I really don't think I can put a positive spin on this one.

My friend had the beef carpacio for starter, and I had a goat cheese & eggplant arugula salad with balsamic. I really enjoyed my app, and he said his was decent as well. But things went downhill from there.

For mains we each ordered the tomato-based seafood soup, which sounded lovely with its promises of mussel and scallop and fish and other yummy tidbits. However, once it arrived we were left quietly contemplating what seemed to be an uninspired minestrone soup with undersized pieces of overcooked seafood tossed in to jack up the price (I might mention that this was the most expensive dish they had). It wouldn't have been bad... if I had been paying $10 in a cafeteria. My friend later remarked that a sombre silence that had descended upon our table along with the main course. 

After such a disappointment, I was really hoping dessert would somewhat redeem Baldini. But it was not to be. We shared the creme caramel... although it actually seemed to consist of little cream and only the faintest touch of caramel. What I did detect was the unmistakable taste of overcooked egg - to that point where rubbery little bubbles form. The thing didn't even hold its shape, being half-crumpled-over on one side. Maybe they thought we'd never seen a creme caramel before. I don't know. 

Food vs price: 1/5
Service and ambience: 4/5

Overall, I was really disappointed. Although I will try to keep an open mind, I would not come back without extenuating circumstances (such as free food)."}
{"text":"Crap--Crap--and more--Crap

My wife and I finally checked out this local Italian joint because it looks so quaint from the outside.   If you just want to look in the window, it's fine....It you want a good meal, you better keep walking.

Salads were overdressed, food was overcooked..... To make matters worse, they tried to overcharge us by $20 ......   You can do way better in Leslieville....   Trust me..... We're foodies and eat out A LOT....."}
{"text":"This is based on lunch only but I give 5 stars.  Tried two sandwiches and both were great (not to mention amazing prices).  Friendly service, warm atmosphere just an overall nice place to eat.  Walked by it a million times and now I regret waiting so long to try it."}
{"text":"Small restaurant tucked away in Leslieville. I went on a Monday night so the place wasn't too busy - only a few diners. 

Food - I ordered the chicken spaghettini pasta which was saucy and I could taste all veggies in it.  Portion size was good. Had to pack myself the remainder which I had the next day and the flavours still tasted fresh. I would definitely order it again! 
Also, like most Italian restaurants, you start off with a serving of bread, olive oil and balsamic. 

Service - no complaints

Atmosphere - it's a very intimate restaurant. May be more intimate than some of the other Leslieville restaurants you've been to. You can almost hear other people's conversations without paying much attention. The decor could use some sprucing up. It just looked a little \"tired\"."}
{"text":"**1/2

I agree with Brian M., Baldini's is nice, for what it is - a convenient, casual, local joint for you to load up on Italian food.

I came here with my sister on a Wednesday night and this place was packed (not that it's very big to begin with).  The tables are all very close together and if you're claustrophobic, this might not be the restaurant for you.

I noticed that people waiting for a table at the door were given a glass of wine on the house, which is a generous touch.

The service here is quick but casual.

Now on to the food.  It wasn't bad.  From a flavour perspective, it gets top marks.  It is on the texture that they lose big time.  

For starters I opted for the Grilled Calamari and my sister opted for the Tiger Shrimps saut√©ed in garlic.  Her shrimps were a tad overdone and the accompanying garlic bread was burnt.  

My calamari was okay, but the spices they used to \"crust\" the calamari were also burnt.  

For mains I opted for the Zuppa di pescatore (Italian version of a Bouillabaisse) featuring the daily fish (which was trout), calamari, 1 tiny bay scallop, mussels and shrimps.  Again overcooked.  The mussels were so overcooked they shriveled down to about pinky-size, the 1 bay scallops was beyond done, the trout was dry and calamari was passable.  Again, taste-wise, spot on but texturally - nay!

My sister had the Linguine di mare which had an amazing tomato sauce with naturally sweet tomato flavour.  The linguine was done to perfect al dente and the seafood was less overcooked.

For dessert we both shared a Limoncello Cherry Tart which was very yummy.  The lemon curd was luscious but the tart shell was a tad bit too hard.  I had to try very hard not to attack the neighbouring tables with chunks of tart crust when trying to get at it.

I had ordered an espresso but the server totally forgot.

V E R D I C T

For Italian food in Leslieville, I would pass on Baldini.  While the redeeming features are the affordable prices and friendly service, the food is just so-so.  I would opt for Gio Rana's Really Really Nice restaurant if you're looking for an Italian place in Leslieville."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:

Baldini's has a number of gluten-free options, including most of their pasta dishes which they substitute with gluten-free pasta. I was in the mood for something creamy so I went with the Penne alla Vodka, which I was told was made with potato vodka. It was delicious and I did not have a reaction. They charge an extra $3 for gluten-free pasta (standard practice but I think it's stupid), so the dish came to $25. In terms of gluten-free beverages they have a decent wine list along with standard non-alcoholic drinks - water, pop. 

While I enjoyed the food, I found the service was awkward and strange. It's a small location with two waiters who seem to tag team all the tables instead of having designated tables. This just added to delays of taking orders and confusion when bringing out food. One of the waiters in particular mumbled a lot and acted oddly so you never knew if your answers were being answered correctly or if your requests would be fulfilled. It just created a strange atmosphere and didn't give any feelings of reassurance. As someone with a gluten-sensitivity, this just added to my anxiety of whether I would get sick.  

At the end of the night my meal was supposed to be packed up, but due to miscommunication it didn't seem like the waiter knew that was what was supposed to happen. When he brought out the packed up meal for another guest at my table, mine didn't arrive with it. When we asked about it the waiter said it would be right out. About 10 minutes later I get my container. When I went to warm up my leftovers the next day, I noticed there were a couple of pieces of paper with writing on them in my pasta, along with a slice of squeezed lemon that was not part of my meal. So I'm guessing that instead of admitting that they didn't know it was supposed to be packed up and had tossed it aside, they instead tried to salvage it and put it in a take-out container for me. So gross and so dangerous, especially since I specifically said I had a gluten sensitivity. I have no idea what the cross contamination is like here normally, but considering how they handled my food as well as their poor communication and lack of attention to detail, I'm guessing it could be quite high. 

TL;DR gluten-free options; poor service and possibility of cross-contamination"}
{"text":"The food is simply terrible!
Overcooked pasta, undercooked enriched flour pizza crust and tasteless sauces caused for embarrassment when i went there with an Italian friend  who was visiting!...
And the fact that my previous bad review was taken down due to \"complaints from the community\" lowers my opinion even lower than any possible low rating!"}
{"text":"ALERT: I do not believe the check-in offer for this place is accepted anymore.  Their paper menu now says prix fixe dinner is for two for $70.  I tried asking if they still accept this offer but our server mumbled something that neither confirmed or denied it.  I didn't want to make a fuss about it.

I came here to have a nice dinner and catch up with some friends about their recent travels.  The place is intimate and the interior has the atmosphere of a calm and serene dinner atmosphere.  The dining room had a light chatter which was nice to hear but it was a little warm in there as it was packed wall to wall.

Their website advertised a buck(two bucks really)-a-shuck promo but we didn't see it on their specials board and had to ask for it specifically.  The server mentioned that they were really busy so they just kept it on the down-low  In the end, I didn't really find it worth it.

Their menu has a lot of classic and staple Italian dishes and I definitely took my time to scan it.  I was feeling hungry that day so I went for a starter and a main accompanied by a glass of house red.

I started with their caprese salad and it was very satisfying with thick cut of tomato and bocconcini accompanying some greens with the usual drizzle of olive oil and balsamic.  It tasted really fresh and vibrant.

My entree of stuffed chicken breast with provolone and prosciutto was also a delight.  The chicken was moist and it was rested on a good portion of garlic mashed potatoes and some veg (green beans, carrots, and etc).  The mustardy pesto cream sauce really gave it a subtle punch of flavour.

My YEAs smoked salmon pasta (the salmone) was also very good too.  The pasta was the right el dente and that light white wine rose sauce with the leeks was a good combination.  The portion looked like a good size as well.

 In the end, I wish I could give this place a 3.5 star rating as it was an overall satisfactory time."}
{"text":"Baldini's is a wonderful, low-key Italian resto in a quieter part of the Leslieville strip, on the North side between Carlaw and Pape.  Never heard of it?  I'm not surprised given the lack of media write-ups or the minimal number of Yelp reviews.  It surprises me given the quality of food, service and ambiance. 

On my most recent visit, I enjoyed the delicious seafood linguine.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and served with a generous portion of seafood in a deliciously garlicky sauce, which is right up my alley.  The service is always friendly and prompt.  Definitely left me with a family-run sorta feel.  Lastly, the space is quaint and romantic.  It's definitely on the warm and cozy side, which is perfect in the fall-winter.  

Since I live in the 'hood, I've always used Baldini's for take-out.  They were prompt, efficient and friendly...and the food has always been tasty!  A winner in my books!"}
{"text":"My mother picked up a Groupon for Baldini and we had a chance to check it out last week. We had a great experience! My mother was in awe over the delicious grilled calamari appetizer. That alone was worth it, she was so thrilled. I think she's still dreaming about it. We had pasta entrees and everything was fresh and prepared wonderfully. We shared a dessert which was also nice. I'll definitely take my mother back again so she can have the grilled calamari though. That was the highlight."}
{"text":"My love for pasta had been put on ice for so long, the wheat-free thing, over indulging of home cooked sauces, the lack of stellar, affordable mom and pop Italian spots near home... 

And then, all of that fades away and we enter to tiny tables packed with boisterous locals, the smell of garlic and tomato wafting from the kitchen. Ahhhhh, calm. 

The menu is kept manageable with first, second, pasta and pizza dishes. And oh, what's this - gluten-free pasta? I can eat pasta at an Italian restaurant? It's at this stage we've ordered a decently priced wine ($33 for a Chianti) and I'm getting hungry. 

I couldn't have ordered better for my hunger level and cravings. The Fusilli Rose was packed full of eggplant, the sauce was so flavourful, and the gluten-free pasta -- which is often hit or miss -- was cooked el dente. 

The best surprise was when our server brought me gluten-free breadsticks so I could join in the oil-vinegar-swim with my dining mates. 

Solid food that I'm already again craving!"}
{"text":"First time here for lunch. Quiet place but very good food. Good pizza with lots of meat and a lovely pasta that my grandaughter devoured. Good winereasonably priced too."}
{"text":"We love this place. Always have since the first time we tried it. I've never had a poor meal here and in fact, each new thing I try is wonderful. Like tonight: had the veal scaloppini with Marsala wine sauce. So good.  And as usual, the starter calamari is some of the best calamari we've had in the city. 

Highly recommended. Kyle is great. He'll know exactly what you want to eat.  Just ask him for recommends. 

Yum."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon for Baldini and decided to use it with my boyfriend on Wednesday night.  I made a reservation (which is req'd for the groupon - and make sure you tell them you have the groupon!).  

We got there at 7:30pm, and I was surprised at how busy the place was on a weekday!  I thought it was a good sign for sure.  The constant stream of people coming in for take out was also nice to see.  

The place is really small, so the seats are pretty cramped, but fortunately we sat at a table for 4, so a bit more room.  There was one server for the whole place, and considering how busy it was he did a great job running around and was very attentive.  

The waiter brought out a bit of bread to start, with oil and vinegar on the table.  The bread was average at best, and seemed like it had been sitting there for most of the day.  

The Groupon gets you 2 appetizers, 2 mains and 1 dessert to share.  It does not apply to specials, however, which is fair.  I ordered the lemon shrimp to start.  The salad was a bit overdressed, but overall I really enjoyed the appetizer.  My boyfriend ordered the calamari.  The presentation was nice.  I tried a piece and thought it tasted pretty good - and I'm not a fan of calamari.  

For the main my boyfriend ordered a pizza.  I didn't have a piece, but it looked quite tasty.  A good size as well.  I ordered pasta.  Spaghetti with chicken, goat cheese, herbs.  I can't remember exactly what it was called.  The waiter said it was his favorite.  I wouldn't say it was the best pasta I'd ever eaten, but it was decent.  A bit too saucy and not enough flavour, but overall it was enjoyable.  

We shared the Grand Marnier Creme Caramel to finish.  It was nice, and light, but tasted like every other creme caramel I've had.  Nothing too special about it.  

My overall experience was good.  If I was in the area I'd go back."}
{"text":"I arranged a birthday dinner for my partner, and 9 of our friends. Being a Wednesday night, I was a bit apprehensive when I saw the place was fully seated, and only had their main host, and one other server. For a table of 11 people, the service was fast, friendly and efficient. Drinks and apps arrived in a timely fashion, and all the mains were served within a couple minute of each other. Choices ranged from pizza, to pastas, and their filet and seafood dish. Consensus around the table was that the food was very good, and the prices were very reasonable.

At the end of our meal, Baldini's host arranged separate cheques for anyone that wanted, which always makes large group situations less taxing. I would not hesitate in recommending Baldini's to anyone, whether your a table of 2 or 12."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Just Eats.. in one word disgusting.  Caesar salad was soggy, pizza tasted weird with terrible sauces, bruschetta was below average.  Small portions as well.  All that crap for $50, and they forgot the 2 pops I ordered and refused to deliver them.  Avoid at all cost , which are plenty too boot."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on a Saturday night with my partner. The food was amazing, and it may have been the best meal I've had since coming to Toronto. I had the Veal scaloppini and a Caesar salad, with a glass of red. The dressing was made in house, as you would expect from a good Italian restaurant, and both dishes were delicious. 

The service was friendly, quick, and knowledgeable, and helped me pair my meal with a good red from their collection. The ambience was spot on for a quiet or romantic meal. I can't comment on their lunch or brunch offerings, but this place is a hidden gem for dinner."}
{"text":"It was lunch, I was in the area and I was hungry. I was told by my brother that I had to try Baldini because it was the best food in the area. Always willing to try a new restaurant, that is where him and I headed. When we first walked in it was a treat for the senses. Dual layer table clothes, cloth napkins, oil and vinegar on the table, the smell of fresh sauce; a great visual for an Italian restaurant. My brother and I were greeted by a very smiley Tony, who I later found out was the owner of the restaurant. Tony even recognized my brother as having been there before and remembered personal details that he asked about, very nice and welcoming.

Leslieville is a very over priced area when it comes to food, with lunch anywhere you go being in the $15+ range. Baldini was no different with most sandwiches being $8+ and pizzas being 12+, then add a drink and you are $15-20 for lunch. The atmosphere though was a lot more welcoming than other restaurants in the area which I have found to have a pretentious attitude in the air. Both my brother and I got the Carne pizza, although he kept trying to push the Siciliano sausage sandwich because he had it before and it was incredible.

The food came out pretty quick, looking and smelling great. The taste matched the smell and was one of the best pizzas that I have had in the city. The crust was thin and crispy and I don't know if it was the mix of 50% wheat flour or what, but it had a really nice taste to it. The sauce tasted homemade, but with everything else on the pizza it was overpowered too much to notice. The meats were cooked very well which isn't found too often when it comes to pizza places I found, and the bacon used was thick and crispy. I love pizza like Pizzeria Libretto or Magic Oven, but I think overall the pizza at Baldini is a much more solid pizza (the fresh basil on top giving it a more Italian feel doesn't hurt either).

All in all it was a fantastic lunch. A big and fun personality of the owner, the Italian feel and smells on first entrance, and the full flavoured food. Although I was there with my brother, this would be a perfect location for a nice quiet, romantic date. I have of course not seen the setup for dinner (if candles are out on the tables and the lights turned low), but between the price point and the atmosphere, I can't help but recommend. For anyone wandering through the Leslieville area, I suggest you pop into Baldini for some of the greatest food I have found (so far) in the area."}
{"text":"Baldini's is a quaint little Italian place that fills a nice Niche in the area. The food is traditional Italian and what you'd expect. Pizza, pasta, salad, steak, fish with a slice of tiramisu for dessert. There are no surprises here, the ambiance is nice, prices are average and the wine selection is decent.

That being said ... everything appears to be under seasoned, especially the fish; and nothing on your plate will leave you with a lasting impression. 

If you're in the area and craving a run of the mill Italian plate, go for it; otherwise, you can probably find better elsewhere in the city."}
{"text":"Italian food is always a comfortable choice in winter. A cozy restaurant hosting a couple on a cold windy night at a candle lit table like take from a Hollywood romantic comedy. Baldini delivers on this opening scene.

Yet this venue falls into the same class of decent that many other restaurants fall into. A local joint with some established clientele but generally average food priced above the quality. 

Between myself and my date we had the bruschetta, calamari and two types of pasta. Of the four only the calamari stood out as something beyond what you cook regularly yourself at home. The pastas were average, one over creamed. The bruschetta was underwhelming and the wine we choose was your average Italian blend marked up 3 times. 

All in all a mediocre experience bumped up slightly by a nice smiling staff whose attentive service helped make the experience more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great experience. Each of our four appittizers and entres surpassed our expectations. Fabulous food! Excellent service."}
{"text":"Cozy, petite Italian restaurant in Leslieville. Great atmosphere and fantastic service.

Warm bread served as a starter. Bruschetta here was wonderful! 

VEGETARIANS: Herbivores beware, their pastas are cooked in chicken broth unless you ASK for it to be complete vegetarian. Good veg pizza with roasted vegetables.

The cappuccino here is quite strong!"}
{"text":"Been here more than a few times and it's always delicious! Their carbonara is the best!! Patrick is delightful and makes us feel welcome while providing excellent and friendly service. Good idea to make a reservation as it's often busy!"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant located on Queen Street East. We picked up a groupon for this place and to be honest, would not have known it existed otherwise. It was a excellent surprise! Good service! Good food! Only minor negative was that you should expect to be seated for a long time. The appetizers and entrees took a long time to come out. I guess the positive is that your food is made fresh :). So don't come here if you are in a hurry, we stayed at this restaurant for more than 2 hours. 

Onto the food!
I chose the grilled calamari for my appetizer. Generous portion size! Well cooked! Lots of rings of yum!

I ordered the spaghettini carbonara for my entr√©e. The pasta was al dente, not overcooked at all. Sauce was just the right amount of creaminess and lots of bacon! 

Dessert, I ordered the tartufo ice cream, which was pretty standard.

Would come back again! Was a great surprise find! Make sure you make a reservation, this place is very small!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times over a few years and I like it more each time. \"Cozy\" is the perfect word to describe the atmosphere. I can't think of any other restaurants that are so quaint and charming. The server is fantastic; very friendly and knowledgeable. Food is very good. I've visited for both brunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I don't know much about Italian cuisine (even though I took a cooking class years ago in Florence, I'm blaming the wine for my lack of retention), but I do know when a server says our special tonight is _____, you stop him/her right there and order it. Case in point, a delicious pasta dish with a light tomato sauce, some veg and a spicy Italian sausage. The flavors blended together so nicely, and I felt the proportion of sauce to protein to pasta was spot on. Sometimes places will amp up the noodles because it's the cheapest component on the plate, but not the great folks at Baldini. 

And great they were! Incredibly nice, very attentive, great at making a tasty red recommendation to sip with my eats, and quick to notice when I needed more water or bread (bread + olive oil = yum). 

I think my favourite part of the experience was the seating situation. It's really intimate inside (like most Leslieville jaunts I've noticed) which makes for a super close evening with friends. I was alone, but a table of hilarious men sat adjacent to me (almost with me) to celebrate one of their bud's birthdays. I didn't catch that gent's name but they made him wear a tiara that said Princess, so he'll forever be known to me as Princess. 

Get this, not that I was eavesdropping (give me a break the tables are close!), but I overheard Princess tell the other dudes about this section of the subway that has yet to be completed. Right now it's just a desolate underground abyss waiting for someone to pour more money into it to complete the line. I was super curious about where this station is located. Can you imagine heading down their for an event? Some sort of underground music/dining deal where only those in the know, know?  

All in all a great evening out. I suggest grabbing an appetizer instead of saving room for dessert. Nothing on the menu sounded too interesting to me the night I was there, and the sweet I ordered (couldn't even tell you what it was) was overshadowed by the tasty bread and olive oil and delectable pasta special!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place after reading the Yelp reviews and being not overly impressed by the Nose, which is the close-to-home Italian place in the neighbourhood. 

Baldini's is nice and cozy, quiet and perfect for a date night. What really won us over was the food. Basically, it was exactly as you always hope each dish will taste. My boyfriend ordered bruschetta, and it tasted exactly how you hope bruschetta will taste when you order it. Same went for the minestrone soup.

The entrees were excellent as well. I had the agnolotti amore, which was something like a butternut squash ravioli in rose sauce. There was a bit too much sauce, but too much is better than too little. I just scraped a bit of it off, but I love butternut squash, so that's what I wanted to taste more than anything, and with a little less sauce, it was perfect. 

The service was charming and friendly with a bit of humour. All in all, an excellent night out for Italian food. We raved about it the whole walk home, and we'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Guess this is a late review. 
Was here a couple times. One for a work brunch... it was good nothing spectacular.
And the other was a lunch date.
I didnt have much time so I had the cesar salad with chicken and my date and some meaty meal. He seemed to think it was ok. My salad overdosed with burnt garlic and dry chicken. I didnt eat much of it, thus I must have appeared to be those dainty date eaters (Im not). 
So that is why I have not been back here. Even though Im so close to this place. 
And the date - he turned out to be just as bad as the Salad. I should have been forewarned just by the salad alone."}
{"text":"This place is in my boyfriends neighborhood and we always wanted
To try it out. We are sorry we did! Starting with walking in, where we were not greeted  by the server when we came in, followed by bruschetta which had freezing cold topping that was fizzy tasting. When we sent it back, the server told us \"that's how it tastes\". The mains were pretty mediocre too, especially for the price. Skip this place if you want good service or good food."}
