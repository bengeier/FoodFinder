{"text":"Kind of a hole in the wall, but their curry is awesome.  I usually get order it for \"a little bit of a sweat\".  If you like curry, check them out."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my first visit to Asian Grille and became a repeat customer.  I was expecting standard Chinese-takeout type joint with plastic topped tables and the usual entrees.  Instead I found a tastefully decorated, dimly lit space that would be great for a casual-but-nice date night or get-together with friends.  I ordered mango fried rice and instead of the usual stir-fry with little chunks of everything throughout, got big chunks of mangoes, onions, pea pods and shrimps with hints of curry and spice, and the fried rice serving as more of a sticky binder than the main event.   Everything was super fresh and paired with jasmine green tea it went down great.     On other visits I've also had the ginger duck and the sweet and sour dishes and found them to be very fresh as well.  The sauces tend to be thin and flavorful instead of thick and sugary like more standard Asian fare.   There's one part of the menu where you can basically choose from lots of different kinds of meat/ seafood/ tofu and a variety of sauces to get a plate, with rice, for a fixed price of around 12-13 dollars.  The meat is very tender and juicy, although I thought my duck dish could have used a little more duck - I presumed they went veggie- heavy to keep the price in line with the cheaper meat dishes.  Dinner for two can be had for around 25-30 dollars plus tip, and you're likely to have some leftovers to take home.  Although the inside of the restaurant is very nice, there are also several sidewalk tables for eating outdoors during nice weather.  The restaurant is located in a mostly residential neighborhood next to the parking lot for a dry cleaners, but the presence of Truffles cafe a couple doors down makes this a pretty busy restaurant block on a nice night.   Recently Asian Grille has started offering live music.  One night a week (I think Fridays) is acoustic night, and on Sunday and possibly Wednesday there are amplified bands playing jazz, blues etc.  Although the music is good, amped music in such a small space tends to drown out conversation, so if you're planning to have a long intimate chat, pick a non-music night or else go early as the tunes don't start till after 7 pm.  Or plan to eat outside.   One potential minus to be aware of:  The place does not serve beer, wine or liquor.  However, they do let you BYO, at least your own bottle of wine, as I've seen people doing that."}
{"text":"Basil Fried Rice  Pad Thai Thai style Sweet and Sour Chicken Eggrolls  Perfect recipe for a hungover Sunday feast.  Wait, does that make it sound like I ate it all myself?  No, no, there were two of us.  That doesn't make it ok?  Hmmm  Either way, everything was pretty great.  Basil Fried Rice is always my barometer of Thai food, and Asian Grille does a darn good job.  It was verrry spicy (which is good), but could have taken just a wee bit more sweetness.  The pad thai took a minute for me to warm up to, but once I did it was really quite good and addictive.  The Sweet and Sour chicken was a nice change from the standard Chinese variety and everything was obviously very fresh.  The eggrolls, well those are never my favorite, but they were fine I guess.  I've never actually eaten in at Asian Grille, but have had it delivered once and picked it up once, both times were great.  However I called last night to get delivery and was informed that they \"don't do that anymore\".  I'm not sure if that means ever, or at 9 pm on a Saturday night (but I will be VERY disappointed if it means the former)."}
{"text":"I decided to try their carry out to see if the dining room was worth the time. After trying two different kinds of curry, I was pretty disappointed. They were both runny, bland and had very grey and suspicious looking chicken."}
{"text":"i went here to try my standard lad nah and samosa. As other reviewers say, it's a teeny tiny dining space - but the staff are personable, friendly, and they make it work. lad nah is never spicy enough for me. but they made it very spicy for me. thanks.I am gonna be your regular now."}
{"text":"Very annoyed. I ordered take out, drove there (reiterating not delivery). I don't tip on take out, but when I looked at my credit card activity I saw that AG tipped themselves. Thanks AG! Obviously I would have tipped had it been table service."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this yummy Thai restaurant. It's a smallish cute space, on Clifton near 110th. The menu is diverse, specializing in Thai favorites but also offering some Japanese and Chinese items, as well as extensive vegetarian choices. The food is tasty and the spice can be adjusted to suit. There are many interesting house specials, including several duck entrees and the engagingly-named Excited Chicken. I'm excited to have found this restaurant in my neighborhood. (They deliver as well.)"}
{"text":"Unpretentious, no frills kind of place with great food. Fast service and friendly! We enjoyed amazing Pad Thai, a delicious and flavorful house specialty called \"Asian Grille Chicken,\" and some very nice Beef Panang that was very much a sweet meets heat creation.  Our vegetable fresh rolls were also nice. We will be back, but if you are looking for atmosphere this is not the place for you. This place is about good food at modest prices."}
{"text":"I really love this place. Staff is super friendly and go above and beyond! On several occasions the owner has taken my order after they've closed or called me back to let me know he will deliver my order even though they weren't taking deliveries at the time."}
{"text":"Great food, DEPLORABLE customer service!! We ordered crab rangoon, spring rolls, and shrimp pad thai. Pad Thai was great (make it spicy) and the crab Rangoon was okay (it wasn't as good as I expected, given previous reviews). They brought our spring rolls out cold and then when we sent them back, they brought them back out burned. Also, I asked for a water, and he told me to go next door. They only have the drinks that are on the menu (soda and tea). All of the workers are always in the back, so you can never get anyone's attention when you need it.. Only order take out, and be sure to check your food before you leave!"}
{"text":"Great green curry! I ordered takeout for the first time tonight and was impressed. I got tofu green curry, vegetable spring rolls and crab rangoons. The appetizers were very good, hot (temp) and crispy. The green curry was excellent. I usually can't get food spicy enough but this was perfect, made me sweat! The man working was very polite and nice. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"LOVE Asian Grille. & the staff is always so nice!  I've only ever gotten take out, and they've never made a single mistake on my order (even with a few modifications).  It's always delicious. I recommend the Spring Rolls, Coconut soup, and Pad Thai. I definitely recommend checking them out!"}
{"text":"Cute inside, but the tiny, boxy dining area is noisy. There was a tv going the entire time we ate last night, and the sound was up a little. That helped me tune out the convo of the couple sitting next to us a tad. But, I think it was probably too much to have the tv going and the jazzy music overhead too. This place is small and only has one server, who must be busy in the back. However, I never felt like she neglected us and I always had plenty of water, which was good, because my medium spicy dish meant I needed it. I have had the curry a few times, but not for at least a year. My friend and I both shared the red curry and we felt that it lacked something. I decided it was watery and needed to be richer; my friend agreed. We didn't box up the leftovers. However, the spring rolls were awesome. I would normally give the food 4 stars, but our curry was just blah today. Not bad, but not great.    Suggestion to management: Every time I come here, I see someone come in, sit down, not get waited on, and leave. Perhaps management could come up with a better way of knowing when someone enters.   tip: you can't park in front until after 6:30 M-F. Park on the opposite side of the street."}
{"text":"We have loved everything we ever ordered here! The staff is always friendly and the food is always awesome! It's never drenched in sauce or over cooked! The staff is always friendly and we have always received our food fast!!!! This place doesn't look like much from the outside but it IS worth your time!!!"}
{"text":"I loved coming to Asian Grille! I came by special invitation of my friend Kiwi, who owns this Thai restaurant right on the border of Cleveland/Lakewood. I've had a few of their regular items at the Night Market - their pad thai is excellent and they were a huge hit at NMC!   This is mostly commenting on their special menu that they prepared for us (and you can have it too as long as you let them know ahead of time!) My friend's mom (known as Mom) cooked authentic Thai food for us and it was MMM.  We had a spicy whole fish, seafood curry, beef paneng and more. The level of spicy was just right for me, although Mom will definitely cook spicier! Everything tasted great, but I think my favorite was the fish. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've passed this place a million times so finally decided to get takeout for lunch one day. I ordered the Tom Yum soup and the Pad Thai with shrimp. This was $15 which seems a little high for a little hole in the wall kind of place and a Wednesday lunch. The shrimp in both the Tom Yum soup and the Pad Thai were very bad. I ate one and it was very bad tasting plus they smelled and looked bad. Other than the shrimp both dished were fine. But that's it just fine. I thought Pad Thai would be a real safe bet at a Thai place. I hate to give a small business 2 stars but that's what it was."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. I'm a big fan of spice and they have consistently added the perfect amount of heat to every dish I've tried. The portions are a good size as well.   I can walk here from my home. I have only gotten take-out and delivery and have never ate IN the restaurant so I'm not too sure about the atmosphere or ambiance. I know it's a bit dark which is always nice, in my opinion.   YES, they deliver! I almost felt bad because the delivery girl actually walked to my house once. I could have easily walked my fat ass over to the restaurant to pick up my order. She laughed really hard when I told her that. I gave her a nice tip. So obviously, the delivery service is excellent. Anyone that will walk your order to your home because you're a lazy blob... come on, that's good, right?  Man, I felt bad.  This is a nice little neighborhood restaurant that deserves your business. Check it out."}
{"text":"This is a fun little Thai restaurant that seems to do more take-out business than actual sit-down, as we were. We both had excellent soups: chicken coconut milk soup & Tom Yum Tofu soup. The chicken satay was ho-hum, but the scallion pancakes were fine. We would go there again."}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to like this place as the people inside seemed nice and I am always a fan of supporting the neighborhood little guy, but this place fought me on that goal at every turn.    We got carryout and it was a debacle from the beginning. They said ten to fifteen minutes and when I got there after fifteen, I had to wait an additional ten, not a big deal so I was patient. While I was waiting however, I watched a carryout customer leave with his food and come back disgruntled 5-6 minutes later claiming they forgot part of the order, and made a error on something else. Ok. So not off to a great start.   I of course reserved final judgment for the food and that perhaps was a mistake. They would have been better off if I had judged them on the slow, apparently  careless service. I ordered the Pad Thai which should be a no-brainer for a place called Asian Grille. It was perhaps the worst I had ever had. Basically a container or SUPER salty noodles and no other relative taste.  My husband's curry chicken was a flop from the first bite. Saddened, not only did we not finish our food, but were left without any leftovers for the next day as dinner went in the trash. What a crime!"}
{"text":"Update:  Asian Grille has moved to a new location with a new menu and a new name.  They are now Thai Thai and are located at 13735 Madison Ave.     Fantastic food! I've sampled many of the entrees and I've enjoyed them all. Dishes that I don't even like elsewhere, like wonton soup, are simply fantastic here. The crab rangoon (with obligatory special sauce) is out of this world, it redefines the meaning of the words \"crab rangoon\". It's one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten in my life, without exaggeration. I was hesitant to try Thai the first time and they have converted me into a die-hard Thai fan."}
{"text":"Big fan of Asian Grille. I have lived within one block of them for three years now and visit frequently. Whenever friends ask what we can get to eat, I always ask if they have tasted or know what good Thai food is. If they are game to try it out I have never heard a negative word from any of the dozen plus people I have introduced to this restaurant.  Not a big fan of shrimp so I avoid the Pad Thai, but love the spice, fresh veggies, and delicious noodles and chicken in the drunken noodle dish. Yes, it is $9, but usually you will get two meals out of it and both will be delicious even when reheated.   They even allow you to bring in your own alcoholic beverages to drink at the table! Goes great with wine.   One of the near west sides best kept secrets."}
{"text":"I came in alone a few weeks and saw a business man at the counter. He was irritated.   \"No soy sauce??\"   He just didn't seem to understand that this place is geared towards Thai cuisine vs. standard asian foods. If you're looking for chicken chow mein, this is not the zone for you. If you want interesting Thai dishes with a small american twist, then give this place a shot. You will be glad you did.  I'm in it for the Pad Thai. I have to say, their Tofu Pad Thai is the absolute best in Cleveland. Beats Banana Blossom, beats Phenom Penh, beats that new joint up by 130th etc. It's all about tofu preparation and they nail it. Noodles are a little different then you expect, but try it three or four times and you'll realize you're hooked. Huge portions and when you tell them to bring the heat, they make it real spicy! If you order carry out, I think the portions are even larger and it will be ready in 15 minutes every time! $8.00 for a huge portion of Pad Thai seems fair to me.  The samosa appetizers are also pretty darn good if I say so myself.  Park across the street and take a small walk, it's good for you! No parking 4:00-6:30 monday - friday. You will dine in a comfortable and modest interior, which is usually quiet. The atmosphere is extremely laid back. If you're the type that needs to be served and pampered excessively, you might not be happy with the service. It's not bad service, it's just casual. Many yelpers act a bit pretentious, even when they're out of their element. Afterall, it's easy to get behind a computer and pretend to be an expert.  Let me clarify, as a new member of yelp: I am a casual person and do not claim to be a connoisseur in any department of life. If I'm going out to eat I consider it to be a luxury and I'm very easy to please. Many yelpers will take a star off because they live far away from their destination, or for something trivial like being stuck in traffic on the way. Many complain of children and take a star off, etc. These situations are out of the business' hands completely! I try to remove these circumstances from a business which I am rating because it's out of their hands.   My favorite place for Pad Thai in Cleveland, hands down!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food on the West side. Easily. It's so good that as I type this my mouth is watering. No really.   It's great for take out, and also a fun place to go eat with a group of friends. Bring your own bottle of wine and make it even more fun.   The shrimp pad thai is awesome. It's sweet yes tangy. My only complaint is that they leave the tails on the shrimp, but I can overlook that considering how good it is.   I love the vegetable tempura as well. The peanut sauce is tasty and spiced just enough to keep it interesting. They also have great spring rolls. Thai iced tea is delicious as well."}
{"text":"This place was very good. We had the garlic chicken and spring rolls. The service was fast and nice. I was glad to hear they deliver and we will definitely order in the future as well as dine in. They also had the best sweet and sour sauce I've ever had. It's worth a visit for sure."}
{"text":"First and last time I will visit this place. Popped in for a fresh roll and got brown lettuce, brown carrots and shrimp in my \"veggie\" ordered \"not so fresh\" rolls. If I wanted the what collects in my sink drain wrapped in rice paper, I could've made the same thing at home. To top it all off it was extremely difficult to even park for a pick up order because of current street construction so I couldn't turn back to return my order in person, glad it was simply a $5 investment to ensure I never have to \"try\" this place again."}
{"text":"After driving past Asian Grille a good 300 or so times, the gf and I decided to give it a try.  We just got take out, but when we went to pick up our order, we were both impressed with the atmosphere, and want to make a return visit to eat in.   The food was very good.  Most notably, this is the first time in longer than I can remember that my food was almost too spicy to eat.  This was at my request, but it's unusual to get what I ask for in that regard.  That is not to say that my order wasn't delicious, just VERY spicy.  The menu is nearly exclusively Thai, and it was very well prepared.   I really liked the (extra-spicy) Wild Boar Basil, and the gf enjoyed her (mild) Excited Chicken.  The hot and sour soup was both hot, and sour, but not very distinctive from others I've had.  The Bananas in Love dessert was ok, but better at Sweet Mango and Thai Hut. The Sticky Rice with Custard on the other hand was super-delicious, and I suspect I will be suffering cravings for it in the future."}
{"text":"I live a couple blocks away down on Lake. Before I moved to the neighborhood, I was excited to have a Thai place in walking distance. I asked my brother if he ever tried the place before I moved in. He said that he did and did not like it much. I chalked it up to him being a vegan and figured I would still give it a shot. I thought the name was super generic. They could have picked something else do distinguish it from other Asian cuisines and let people driving by know that it is Thai food. I ordered a sampling of various entrees and apps. The prices are about average for Thai around the city. The food was really nothing special. I wish it was because it seems like a nice cute restaurant that I would like to give my money to. I have not been back unfortunately."}
{"text":"I wish there business hours were longer I came a few times and they were closed. Sad because I really wanted it!!"}
