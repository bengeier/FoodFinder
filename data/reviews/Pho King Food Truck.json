{"text":"I got the Burrito Phorrito. It was not good. My kids got the Stir Fry. They said it was ok, but we all ordered the slow roasted brisket for our meat choice and it was almost completely all fat. Couldn't even finish my burrito due to all the nasty fatty brisket."}
{"text":"The Great Pho King. If their name alone doesn't make your stomach dance with the joy and excitement of needing a Pho King fix, then you may have a serious problem. These days it can be tough to find unique food that is delicious and mouth-watering, but The Great Pho King's combination of Vietnamese and French food does just that. The best part about this place is that it doesn't matter where in the east valley you are, because they are portable and make stops all over. If you're used to boring foods and want something that will awaken your taste buds, 'Like' this place on Facebook and follow them to their next food stop. You won't be disappointed!! I pho king love The Great Pho King, and you will too!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this is the worst \"pho\" place I have ever been to. Really disappointed. Food was terrible. Even the \"spring rolls\" were disgusting."}
{"text":"The great Pho King truck came by our office park today.  I had the chicken stir fry. It was a delicious and quite large serving! Tender chicken, tons of crisp-tender veggies; carrots, broccoli, bean sprouts, Kale, etc in a nice light sauce over white rice with some kind of crunchiness on top. It was delightful and actually felt like I was eating healthy!  Which is pretty rare with food trucks!  It was very satisfying and enjoyable.  I cant wait until next food truck Wednesday!"}
{"text":"Not pleased at all. This truck catered our event at work today and I was very disappointed! I ordered a spicy beef stir fry and what I got was a stir fry mess with little to no beef. This is not Vietnamese food.......it's some kind of mess pretending to be Vietnamese food! Service is poor too. I should've chosen the other truck and ordered a cubano. What a waste!"}
{"text":"I was surprised with all of the healthy options that this food truck offers! There are a lot of gluten free options and vegetarian options. I had the veggie spring rolls and they were delicious!! The pho king stir fry was equally amazing, I added extra veggies and made it spicy. It was the best stir fry I've ever had. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM! always fun trying new menu items at this place! never disappoints, staff is great, liking the new dudes they have running it."}
{"text":"I love this place.! So glad they're in my neighborhood & not just food truck business. I always order the pho but will try the stir fry soon.  The spring rolls are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Decided to try this out since I love pho so much and the reviews didn't seem too bad but that, I regret, very very very very much. The place was very niice but the pho sucked. There was no flavor, no taste.  The shrimp even had no taste. I also got pot stickers and was very disappointed that they gave us some extra crunchy pot stickers that were hella burnt. Overall I felt like I was eating a bowl of water and noodles. It was not good food and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"So pho King good. Best pho I've had. And those Sriracha buffalo chicken potstickers. Oh my. Great service and staff. It's a real life food truck! Will be coming back here frequently!"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and staff. Not to mention a clever name. Always phenomenal whether I'm following the truck around PHX or heading in HQ at the new restaurant. Try the bahmi burrito, pho, or stirfry...fuck it everything is good."}
{"text":"Food truck experience.  3 people waiting for their food ahead of me.  Ordered after another guy ahead of me in line.  We both ordered potstickers and he ordered spicy beef and I ordered veggie stirfry.  10 minutes later lady yells my name.  Other guy picks up order and walks away.  Lady sees me and I tell her my name she yells after the other guy.  He brings his order back.  He already started eating the potstickers.   He hands me the stirfry.  Lady hands me the next order of potstickers.  She hands him the next order up.  I am like wtf!  Its written down and one order is beef the other order is veggie!  How hard is it to make that clear?  Anyways I got the beef after I checked a 1/2 hour later because I was at work.  Food is all good I had the pho soup before.  Food is good no lie!  I wonder now where the food trucks get their meat and veggies and base stocks or seasoning.  I wish that was all on every food trucks menus.  Origins of foodstuffs, seasonings and where the meat comes from.  Is that asking too much or am I the crazy person asking questions like this?"}
{"text":"Went to a Yoga event downtown last night and only caught the tail end. The truck was just getting ready to close when we drove up but the guys working it were nice enough to stay open so we could try their food! Very friendly and the pho we ordered was awesome.  I didn't get the stir fry but saw someone else order it and it looked really good so, I'll have to try that next time. Will definitely catch them on Wednesdays at Phoenix Public Open Air Market and any other time I see them downtown. It was pho-king great"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with their beef pho. There were only about 5 small pieces of beef and no herbs. I appreciate a variety of herbs to steep in my pho. At $8.75, it was overpriced, and the quantity was small. Wouldn't try this one again."}
{"text":"Ordered one of their melts, noticed that the sign read \"all meals come with potato chips and a pickle,\" and therefore requested no pickle. When they handed me my food there was a pickle under the melt. I let the gentleman know that I requested no pickle and he argued with me that I didn't and told me to read the sign. What horrible customer service! I am 6 months pregnant and the smell of pickles is extremely nauseating, not to mention it had made my bread soggy. All he did was remove the pickle and give me my food back. I paid $10 and tipped him for that treatment. Unacceptable. I will never eat here again and will be sure to spread the word."}
{"text":"Super yum. I love pho and have tried different versions. This is not traditional pho, but great non the less. Will go back x1000! Favorite is the surf and turf for sure."}
{"text":"Can I give zero stars? This is the worst Pho I have ever had. It's my fault really, trusting a establishment the uses obvious puns as their restaurant name should have been the red flag. Pot stickers were fine as those are difficult to fuck up. However, the Pho is awful. Broth is flavorless, noodles were overcooked, the meat is very close in consistency & flavor to Italian meatballs. It just sucked. Boo I say."}
{"text":"I had the chicken vegetable stir today and it had great flavor and plenty to eat.  Would recommend to anyone wanting a healthy meal"}
{"text":"This food truck parked outside my office for a company lunch. I had the Banh Mi Burrito which was pretty good! Mostly it was A LOT of food!"}
{"text":"Note to newcomers, this is a fusion restaurant! The flavors are not traditional, but I personally wouldn't say that's a bad thing. Ever since moving to the area, my husband and I have been here almost weekly. He enjoys the pho (The American is a favorite because of the delicious beefy broth & sinus-clensing herbs). I almost always get an order of ginger-pork dumplings (very flavorful!), and will often rotate between the stir fry with chicken (comes loaded with veggies) and -oddly enough- their cheesesteak sandwich! Surprisingly, they make the best cheesesteak sandwich I've ever had. Again, it's incredibly flavorful and the beef is excellent."}
{"text":"Went to the pho king food truck finally today and was not impressed.  My coworkers and I have been wanting to try the truck for awhile.  Ordered the beef pho,  asked the guy to split it (wanted to order a couple different things) and he wouldn't.  The order was up quick, thought it was kinda pricey at $9 compared to some of the other places around.  The bowl was small, only 4 pieces of meat, more bean sprouts than noodles, and pretty bland.  I put 2 ounces of blending hoisen sauce and siracha and was still bland.  All in all I wouldn't recommend if you have been wanting to try this food truck like I have."}
{"text":"Went to this food truck on a Wednesday night where some trucks make a stop in downtown.  Being a SoCal boy, Asian, and loves Asian food, I really want to love this place.  However, it just gave me reasons not to.  The service was great, as the lady was welcoming with a smile.  On the other hand, I came here for the food, and it did not live up to expectations.  For example, we had the vegetable stir fry.  I am not sure if they were going the healthy route, but to be frank, it was bland.  Of course it was fresh from the pan so it was steaming in my to go box, although every bite was exactly the same.  It had crunch, I tasted the veggies, but that was about it.  No salty flavor from the soy sauce or any spices to add to the mix.  My wife and I were very disappointed.  Although it could have gone up when we tried the Banh Mi...  And...another disappointment.  The reason I love Banh Mis are the French baguette crunch, as you bite through the sandwhich it may be a little rough, but the spice and Asian flavors should mix in so well.  I, on the other hand, had a sandwhich which bread was soggy from the juices of the meat/veggies.  From my experience, this should be a somewhat dry sandwhich that relies on the spices and flavor from the meat/veggies to compliment the crispy baguette.  No crispy baguette, and definitely a wet Banh Mi, which I was not looking forward to.  I understand some Banh Mis may be different, but this is definitely not what I am used to from San Diego and LA.  I really want to like this place, as we need more great Asian places in Phoenix, but it definitely did not live up to what I expected.  I hope to try the Pho out one day, but I have definitely experienced better."}
{"text":"Yum, love this place! The food is tasty, the pork taco is amazing and my boyfriend always gets the pho and he loves it. Their sauces are delicious and unique. I love the fusion food style.  The patio is great to eat and chill, very comfy vibe.  We've always had great service too, everyone has been super friendly and food always comes out quickly and hot.  We like to come here after hiking or being out all day for some quick food that we know is going to be filling and delicious! Casual cool vibe."}
{"text":"Roasted brisket Stir Fry was great! This place has a full bar, music and great food so glad this place opened up!"}
{"text":"This food truck came to my office complex today and did not disappoint! I was skeptic because I am not a fan of Pho whatsoever but they offer some other things. We got the potstickers and a Banah Mi Burrito with chicken. Imagine stir-fry wrapped up in a delicious tortilla......SO SO SO GOOD! The potstickers were delicious too....crispy just the way I like them! I hope they come back here soon!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating at this food truck, but after eating their stir fry, I would have to agree with the other reviewers -its not that great.  Portion was a good size but it was pretty bland and needed more sauce.  Unfortunately, won't be visiting this food truck again."}
{"text":"Bunch of jerks, first time there and they boxed my car just because I park in front where there was a sign that said for pho king customers, not handicap, not taking two spaces, inside the space lines, didn't said reserved for food truck assholes, one driver started laughing and the other one said \"oh is a stupid bitch\". Jokes on you never again will I dine there, there are so many pho places out there that will treat you like kings like Pho chandler. The only reason I parked there was because my child had an injured leg. No customers NO Business"}
{"text":"Eat Hippie Vegetable Pho with tofu!  Really excellent! My sister had the Lemongrass curry shrimp Pho!  Amazing flavored!  Appetizers included the shrimp summer roll with peanut sauce and it was fresh and filled with great flavored.  I'm going back!"}
{"text":"Tonight I discovered pho king. And you know what? I love pho king! Pho king is like my favorite! My wife likes pho king too!    I could certainly see enjoying pho king with friends, but can also see my self enjoying pho king alone.  Pho king is good for all occasions! I could even see pho king as a nice surprise for a special date. I cannot recommend pho king highly enough."}
{"text":"This review is for the restaurant and I gotta tell you the service was great,  however as stated this is not a traditional vietnamese restaurant, the bowls weren't filled up with noodles as much as most pho places will do and the soup was not served hot enough. Would I come back here? Yes because the service was excellent and overall the good wasn't bad for the most part plus they have their own homemade sriracha sauce and some unique beers I never heard of."}
{"text":"I ordered pho with bok choy - I got my HUGE CUP OF RICH PHO BROTH but NO serving of noodles and kale instead of bok choy. I did not pay to get the wrong order. So I went back down and mentioned to the guys at the truck that I did not receive noodles - I got a dollar in return. and then I realized you all didn't put bak choy in my pho you put kale.  Horrible customer service and your employees apparently don't know the difference between bean sprouts and noodles nor do they know the difference between kale and bok choy. Never eating there again. I was ripped off."}
{"text":"I saw this randomly on yelp, and on the same day they showed up at the parking lot at my place of work in Scottsdale.  Its ate a lot of pho in my lifetime, I would have to say its a food truck and that's it.  Its not a restaurant level, but for a food truck its different from the run of the mill food truck."}
{"text":"The food truck parked at our office building for lunch and I ventured out to take a look at the menu. They offer a variety of options from pho (of course) to pot stickers and stir fry. I went for the beef pho and was not disappointed! The flavor of the broth was the perfect combination of sweet, sour, and spicy. The portion size was perfect for me and a fair $10. Looking forward to trying some other menu items down the road!"}
{"text":"Tried out Pho King Kitchen for the first time today. Split a phorrito burrito with pork and pho bowl with brisket. Both were delicious. I loved the pickled veggies on the burrito and the brisket in the pho. I was really impressed with the portions as well. Definitely will try out other dishes soon!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what their food is like.  I scheduled them to bring their truck to the community that I work at.  The day of the event they never showed.  I called to find out if they had forgot, they said they didn't have us on their schedule.  I double checked my email communication, they had told me the date I was looking for was perfect for them so I scheduled and let everyone know all about it.  They were the only truck I had scheduled that day so they would have had no competition.  So I tried to consider missed communication and went to see if they would be interested in rescheduling them for another day.  Then they told me that we were too far to even bother coming to.  My guess is that they knew how far we were and decided not to show.  I have food trucks begging to come back and trying to get on a regular schedule here so I guess its there loss."}
{"text":"The place is nice and service is friendly and attentive. I ordered the Banh Mi Burrito. I was expecting a flavor explosion based on the description on the menu, but it was a little underwhelming. I do want to say that the brisket that was served with this was really good. So I really wanted to like this place as I do like the concept. If I could I would give them 3.5 stars. I'll give their Pho a try next time."}
{"text":"Food is so awesome, just love their food BUT waited 15 min. at Food Truck Friday at the Capitol today and during that entire time no orders were taken and there were 6 people in front of me. Had to leave. So surprised, and so disappointed because the food is absolutely delicious. Normally would give 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"I tried this food truck yesterday at the Mesa Food Truck Fridays event. My husband and I ordered their Banh Mi Burrito and for $1 additional per meal, got one potsticker. We were actually planning to order something else but by the time we decided to try their food, they were out of some options. The guy at the cashier was very nice. He took our order and said we could have a soda with every meal. For 2 burritos with 2 potstickers and 2 sodas we paid $22, not a bad deal! We waited a few min and the food came out. I was very happy with the size of the burrito because I was pretty hungry. This is the first time I try a Banh mi and it was great! It had fresh rice, cooked & fresh veggies, chicken, and I believe aioli if I remember correctly as well as melted cheese which I should have removed bcz I'm on a dairy free diet but I forgot to mention that when ordering.  Before I started with my burrito, I actually had my potsticker and it was yum. A little on the oily side but nevertheless, really good even without a dipping sauce.  I am glad we ended up trying this food truck while we were at the event. The food was delicious and the price was reasonable. Definitely trying them again next month and probably will try their restaurant in the future since they were kind enough to offer us two $2 off coupons yesterday. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Good, pho sho.  Viet crepes were not bad.  But left me craving for something it was lacking.  It was kind of bland.    They do make excellent juice!!!  I'd try their other offerings next time."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the overall quality. I was so excited that this place was so close.  Everything was gross."}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews before I ordered.  Instead, I read some reviews while I was waiting for 20 minutes for my order to be finished.  Longest food truck service time ever.  These guys have a really clever name, their culinary cleverness stops there -- they are a two man crew when their operation and location truly warrants 3 or 4 to get the job done (Food Truck Thursday at the Hayden Ferry Lakeside campus in Tempe).    During my 20 minute wait I read some reviews explaining the blandness of the food.  I didn't really notice until I had nearly finished my meal, but it was indeed very bland.  It didn't really taste like anything. Except the chicken.  It tasted dried out and overcooked -- I am not sure how they managed to do that.  If they had pre-cooked the chicken would my order of chicken and vegetable stir fry taken 20 minutes?  If they cooked it fresh, why was it bland, dry, and overcooked?    I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"Disappointing! I was so excited to try the food truck as I eat Vietnamese at least once a week and was looking forward to having it as a lunch option close to work. the price seemed rather expensive when compared to my favorite Vietnamese joints but thought I would still give it a try and convinced myself I was paying for the convenience. I ordered a chicken pho and coworker had the beef pho and shared spring rolls. I never managed to find the chicken in my pho and the coworker came up with a tiny morsel of beef. They didn't give siracha even though we asked for it. The broth was so bland that we opted to add about a half bottle of Tabasco we had handy in the desk drawer desperate for some flavor. The spring rolls were equally disappointing. If you like bean sprouts wrapped in rice paper and peanut sauce that tastes like melted skippy then maybe you'll disagree with this review."}
{"text":"One star for one word.  Yuk. The noodles were mushy and cold. The food was served in a large bowl one quarter full . If that's there best,. I can't. Imagine they will be here too long."}
{"text":"I've heard lots of good things about this FOOD TRUCK.   The day I checked them out they were not serving the blackened fish tacos that everyone raves about. I am pescaterian, so my only other choice was the veggie stir fry. It was pretty terrible. Though the veggies were fresh, it was almost ALL bean sprouts with just a few squash, carrots, red peppers, and about 3 tiny pieces of kale. Veggies are pretty cheap, so I expected more for a $10 plate. The rice was really old and hard :( I wish they had a rice cooker in the truck to keep the rice fresh and chewy. The window person was REALLY nice, so they at least have great customer service. If I try them again, I definitely won't get the stir fry."}
{"text":"$8 for broth & Noodles? Want meat? Add $2. Have these guys seen the market value of pho? First time I walk out before ordering."}
{"text":"This food truck came by our work last week so we are always excited to try something different.  I ordered the Bahn mi sandwich.  It is nothing like any I have had before but not in a good way.  It was made with cubed chicken and was super salty.  There were some pickled vegetables on it but you could barely find them.  In all it tasted like chicken cooked in soy sauce thrown on a French roll.  The best I can say is the portion of chicken was generous but with that much salt it is hard to eat it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I didn't. The only thing I liked about this place was the name of the restaurant. My boyfriend and I ordered the fresh spring rolls, banh mi burrito and the great pho King noodle bowl. They used pulled chicken in the spring rolls and it made the rolls taste dry. The Banh mi burrito could have been good but it was bland and  would taste better over rice instead of the tortilla. The pho King noodle bowl reminded me of a vermicelli minus the fish sauce. It comes with a sweet chili sauce but they don't give enough & the noodles stuck together making it difficult to mix.  Our whole meal came out $32 which is kinda pricy for some pho and spring rolls. Btw they also charge you $2 extra for the meet when you order their entrees.   Overall I give it a 1.5 because the girl who rang us up , was nice and I liked the out door seating area especially today when the weather was perfect. However the food was bland, it was over priced and I didn't care to much for the self service."}
{"text":"#phokingawful tonight guys! We loved our first 3 take out meals BUT tonight's was not good at all. I had the pho king noodle bowl with pork & my BF had the stir fry with pork.  The pork was totally unseasoned, not joking. It was like a side of pork thrown in a slow cooker with water. It was gross and I ended up picking it out of my dish. Very disappointing, upset stomach and bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Horrible experience with the PK food truck. I live next to their store front location and have had great experiences with food and value.   We ordered the chicken stir fry which was, without exaggeration, 1/5 the size of their normal portions and had only 5 very small pieces of chicken.   I expressed my concern to cashier and he pretty much told me that they reduced portion size for event and got upset with me and shaking his head at me, in front of other customers, as if I was an idiot expecting a decent amount of quality food for my money.   He told me to deal with it and offered no solution. I then asked for owner and the owner came out of truck.   He unapologetically handles the situation and started expressing how expensive it cost him to have truck at event and needed to cut portions and value because profits were low and he did not apologize for his employees rudeness or unprofessionalism.   I let him know that they now lost a loyal customer at their store front location as well.   This horrible attitude doesn't surprise me coming from employees, but the owner's was just as bad.   I highly suggest you look at other food truck options that won't charge you full price for half of a child size portion."}
{"text":"Tried out the Great Pho King Food Truck yesterday for the first time and was really impressed. I ordered the chicken and veggie stir-fry. The order was very large so you get your money's worth. There was an ample amount of chicken, peapods, green beans, carrots, and water chestnuts. There were also bean sprouts. Many bean sprouts. In my opinion way too many bean sprouts but they may have just gotten overzealous. And all of this was served on white rice.  Regardless of the sprouts, the dish was incredibly flavorful. All the ingredients worked really well together. I thought I'd only eat half but ended up eating almost the whole thing because it was so tasty.  Overall I really enjoyed my lunch and will definitely hit up this truck the next time it's by my work."}
{"text":"This is the first time I tried this place. I ordered the chicken stir fry. They did not have chicken so they made it with steak instead which was fine with me. I ordered extra vegetables which only cost 50 cents. The guy that took my order was pretty friendly. I paid cash. The wait was typical for a food truck.   The portion was pretty big which compensated for the hefty $9 paid for the plate. I was very disappointed with the dish's flavor. It had way too much seasoning and salt on it. I am not sure if it was soy sauce or garlic or both, but the flavor was way too strong and the plate was drenched in it. I couldn't get through 4 bites without taking several sips of water. The vegetables were overcooked and did not seem like I got the \"extra\" amount. It seemed like they gave me the leftover tidbits of super small pieces. The beef was okay.   Overall, I had to throw away my plate because it was way too salty and seasoned to eat. What a bummer! Gave them two stars because it was my first time trying it. Maybe they had an off day."}
{"text":"Pho king phenomenal! The Pho King was catering a private event I attended, inside they had prepared appetizers for the party and were making fresh pho and stir fry for guests on the truck. My favorite item was the bahn mi sandwich, which is a toasted French roll with spicy chicken and pickled vegetables with a sweet seasoning sauce. It was a wonderful adaptation of a traditional bahn mi sandwich and flavor was incredible! My friend got the beef pho, it looked amazing and I can't wait to find them and try that too!"}
{"text":"My dream has come true. Pho on wheels is a thing!!! Wednesday food truck days at my office , and when something this awesome comes through I can't pass it up. Those that know me besides coffee my favorite thing is Pho. Everything Pho! I ordered the pork Pho and a side of potstickers. AMAZING! I ordered extra jalapeños which for me makes it even tastier. Great job guys! I'll follow you to the end of the Earth...or to Peoria  Customer for life."}
{"text":"Loved the Food Truck! And I LOVE THE RESTAURANT  Really fun vibe..Simple menu with great choices.."}
{"text":"Probably the worse pho I've ever had. Great idea for a food truck though. I might give them another try."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! It's a great find!! I had the spring rolls with sweet chili sauce! Everything was so fresh tasting!!! Will be back!"}
{"text":"As someone who loves Vietnamese food and was thrilled to have a new restaurant in the neighborhood, I have to share disappointment for Pho King. I ordered the shrimp bahn mi burrito via grubhub, and I'm truly hoping the wrong item was delivered. Firstly, the burrito did not have any shimp in it and comprised only of dry rice, large pieces of vegetables and jalapeños with a warm Mayo sauce and warm cucumbers. The flavor was not at all of a bahn mi..any pickled vegetables were masked by immense amounts of American rice, there was no cilantro, no semblance of bahn mi flavor. Disappointed by the order inaccuracy, but moreso over this restaurant underestimating their customers' knowledge of Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"10 stars! My fave food truck at go daddy in gilbert.  Love their pho! Yummyliciously good."}
{"text":"Ok, so I've never had pho before this, so I don't have a benchmark. What I do know was the pho was really bland, so the second time I tried the Asian Invasion cheesesteak... $9 for a sandwich with nothing else, made on a cheap store-bought roll that tasted nothing like french bread.   When my sister saw I wasn't all that enthusiastic about my sandwich, she offered to let me try her banh mi. It was super salty and on the same roll, with veggies that I thought were supposed to be pickled but lacked any bite.  Put enough sriracha on anything and it's edible, but for these prices, I want better."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but I quickly felt disappointed after seeing the menu board. I was hoping for many pho options (this place has a great name!), but the menu only had one- beef broth, you pick the protein for $2-3 additional. Okay, so you could technically say there's more than one option, but pairing beef broth with chicken, pork, or shrimp etc just seems wrong. I decided to pair beef with beef broth. Logical.   This place wasn't a standard restaurant sit down place by any means. You order at the counter and the cook shouts out your number when the meal is ready. Given how few people were in the restaurant, it would have been nice to have the meal delivered to the table.  The menu items ordered were chicken potstickers, pho with beef, and stir fry with chicken. Potstickers were amazing with the sweet chili sauce. Entrées were good.... They just didn't leave me craving more or feeling like wow that was a great dish.   Another odd thing was serving pho without an Asian spoon. All I could locate was a standard metal American tablespoon. Am I being picky at this point? Yes, but that utensil is commonplace at all other pho restaurants. They clearly aren't going for authenticity of any sort at this place.   I've personally never been to their food truck so I don't know what the 'usual' menu items are and how they're served up. However I've been to many pho restaurants and this is unlike any other."}
{"text":"Other than the veggies, the banh mi is nothing like a real banh mi.  Even if you throw out all the normal ingredients, the most important part of a banh mi is the special bread which is made with rice flour and is light and crispy.  You can buy these by the garbage bag around town, not sure why they're using floppy french bread.  :("}
{"text":"The tacos were really good! I'll be back very soon! Try the shrimp taco you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This review is for the Pho King food truck, not the restaurant.  After a full day of being on panels at Phoenix Comicon (and another one to attend in an hour), I needed a supper that was 1) fast, 2) filling, 3) loaded with vegetables. I had already scouted out the food trucks that would be on Adams Street and knew Pho King presented the healthiest options for me. Fortunately, I got there when there was only one man ahead of me in line and a few others lingering nearby in wait for their food.  I asked the man at the counter about the wait time. He said 5 minutes, and I think it was actually just under that. I ordered the chicken and veggie stir fry. It really hit the spot. It contained a good amount of food. There was a thin layer of rice, a hefty serving of fresh and crisp vegetables (what I so desperately wanted and needed!), and sauced big pieces of chicken breast on the top. The stir fry sauce was a bit salty, but I'm used to making my own sauces at home, so that's really to be expected.  I'd grab food from this truck again. Plus, the name made all my writer-friends laugh. We can't help but love profane puns."}
{"text":"I had been waiting since the last visit because the pot stickers were just that good. A little disappointed today. Maybe a different crew manning the qheel? The pot stickers were burnt, they were only taking cash and the bed of sprouts were missing. Ill try them again when they come back but Im just not sure."}
{"text":"What an awesome add to southern Scottsdale.  The pho is a family favorite and the wraps taste like freshy spicy goodness. The location is awesome with great parking and the staff are helpful in answering all your questions~  There is plenty of Pho King parking!!!"}
{"text":"So, I was just there this afternoon for lunch and was excited to try their food. I wanted to try the crepe but wasn't available today so I ordered Pho'ket (stir fried chicken & veggie over rice) and a piece of spring roll. Spring roll was pretty good but nothing close to what I'm used to eating at real Vietnamese restaurants. Stir fry was just ok. Nothing special. It was little bit on the salty side and the rice was undercooked and bit hard. Will I try again? Probably not."}
{"text":"My buddy and I drove by and thought wow there is a Pho here.  Walked in and ordered the Pho soup bowl.  I might as well call it the Pho Soap Bowl cause that's how the beef broth tasted.  In fact we both thought that's why they placed themselves adjacent to the car wash next door.  Also i felt it was over priced.  I have been to a few Pho establishments and even though this place doesn't really specialize in Pho or come close to it I would not come back here again."}
{"text":"1. The Broth- I like that shit clear AF, with a lil slippery smack in my mouth. I need that anise, clove, and ginger to make a cute lil love child with the salty. These guy's broth had none of these things. It pho king sucked mang. Cloudy ass soup. Flavors off balance.   2. The Meat- If that's what you want to call it. Them shits were, not abundant.. dry coochie, flaps of grey.  3. The Noodles- First, there were not enough of them. Also, the texture was off here. They had no bite to them. The brittle fuckers broke up in my soup and I was left with a bunch of little 1/2 inch rice noodle munchkins that my honky fingers were unable to capture between chopsticks.  4. The Veg- My container was delivered to me with some big ass stems n shit in there. Someone didn't take the time or effort to manicure my herbs properly. No sticks, no stems, no seeds foo. Everybody knows this.  5. The Portion Size vs Price- These guys skimped on everything it seemed. You will pay 10 bones for a small cup of mostly cloudy broth with a couple baby grey shavings of meat, broken noodles, and some stems.   My favorite pho spot serves 2x more food for 30% less money, and the ingredients there are always head and shoulders above what Pho King is dishing up. Plus, dude taking my money at the truck was not friendly. He said,  \"$10. Name? Call you when it's ready.\"  No Thank You. No appreciation. Then he didn't even say my name lol.. He just said! BEEF!.. and put my order on the counter. Shame-"}
{"text":"Update: So I don't know what happeend today. Typically.. on a friday (espcially a cold day) this is my go-to.   True to form, I ordered my usual.   This time... not only did the Pho cost a dollar more than it does usually... I am still hungry. Literally all I got was a small pinch of noodles and a sprig of Kale... and ALL BROTH. I mean.. .I like broth  like everyone else but can't I get some substance? There was a guy that I haven't seen before there... I hope this isn't a trend. I guess I better get a second lunch O_0    I am a vegetarian. I have been for 23 years. So, it's hard to find veggie options on foodtruck fridays ni front of the State Capitol.  However, even though it isn't on the menu, the couple that owns this truck, makes veggie pho for me anytime I ask. They are truly outstanding... and I can't think of better customer service.  And while I have tasted better Pho...(I've migrated from Washington, DC in a place where there are plenty of outstanding spots)... I come back to this one because it's pretty darn good (the broth is amazing and I finish.. almost lick my bowl each time)..and the customer service is top notch. awesome food by awesome people... I think you can't get much better than that."}
{"text":"Came here to try the hype and it's just hype. I'm not one to be too critical but I feel my only reason for sharing my opinion is to help the business itself improve. Coming from someone who works in the industry an idea like this can go far but not if they don't hear their customers out and improve, they will not last. I ordered the big bowl of Pho with Pork and I was underwhelmed. If the food is in your name you should be able to represent right? Keep in mind I'm an avid Pho eater and can eat a delicious same size bowl for $4 dollars cheaper. There was too much cilantro, stingy with the meat, broth was bland and noodles over cooked. Amongst my family we ordered tacos, potstickers and the noodle salad. All bland and it's quite obvious which ingredients were fresh and not- also judging by how quick everything came out of the kitchen it's not always a good thing. I think 3 stars is good for the idea and effort but other than that I'm being generous. Something has got to change, I probably won't ever be back until then but food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by this new food truck the minute I heard of it. The name is funny and the gimmick is cute. When I saw on Facebook they would be at the public market today, I was really excited and decided to try them out. Yes...I know it is over 100 degrees...but pho is awesome! So the BF and I went to the Phoenix Public Market and the truck was there. I got the pho ga (8$) and the BF got a grilled cheese (lol). I asked them if it was in a container I could carry for a few blocks and they said yes. Then we proceeded to wait for a really long time. Now, I know they are a new truck, but the wait time was pretty long for soup and grilled cheese. When we got the food, the pho was in about a quart sized styrofoam container with no lid and the sammich was on a plate....ok....I suppose I can walk with that. Anyway, by the time I had gotten home, the noodles had soaked up a lot of the broth making it sort of a mushy mess. I think maybe they need to have a different game plan for people taking the food to go like most pho places (e.g. noodles in a container, broth in a separate container). The pho was not flavorful enough and needs more depth....the broth was kind of bland and no amount of jalapeno and basil helped and I expected more than that (especially for 8$ when you can get a much larger bowl of pho at Pallets down the street for the same price or a larger bowl anyplace in Seattle for around 4$). The grilled cheese was good. Anyway, I was sort of disappointed....it seems that this place is more gimmick than substance. Maybe they just need more time to get the kinks out, but I don't think I would go out of my way to eat at this truck again."}
{"text":"My wife and I were patrons of Pho King Food Truck at an event this weekend.  After what we had, we will not be recommending this to anybody.  My wife, originally a native to Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam), even told me that she makes better Pho Bo (or Pho Ga) and Banh Mi then what was offered.  Recommend that you make and market the original banh mi, not a banh mi burrito.  Go to the streets of Ho Chi Minh City and learn from the locals how to make a good banh mi!!  Go to the floating market in Can Tho and learn how to make proper Vietnamese noodles and soup.  What you serve is no where close."}
{"text":"Banh mi alone gets five! We stopped by the food truck caravan and could smell the beautiful smell of pho wafting from the pho king, so we tried it out. Super good and definitely worth a try. Banh mi is bloody hard to find. Good banh mi is like tummy christmas! What it lacks in authenticity, it makes up for in tastiness. For sure woild do it again."}
{"text":"This truck was parked out in front of our office today. I ordered the bahn mi and my buddy got the pot stickers. He made a remark about how the pot stickers bag that you could see through the window were the same kind as the ones he bought at Costco frozen. As far as my sandwich, it was meh. The bread was mushy, not soggy but not really toasted, the pickled vegetables were decent but the chicken had no flavor at all.  Overall it wasn't that great but I ate it all. Probably would try something different next time. I regret not getting more Sriracha because that was the only flavor it really had."}
{"text":"Had the stir fry chicken bowl.  Was excellent, fresh, and tasty.  Pot sticker on the side was well done too.  Price was decent when comparing to the fresh food, veggies, and service."}
{"text":"I updated my rating by one star because of good customer service.  The owner reached out to me because of my original review and explained why they ran out of containers the day I tried to patronize their truck, and clarified the issue with having bahn mi listed on the menu but not available as an offering.  Apparently, they do offer it some days, but they just didn't offer it that day.  I still have not had an opportunity to try to the food, but I'm hoping to be able to soon, and will then update my review again based on the food. :)"}
{"text":"I have no idea how anyone could rate this place negative. They were at my office today and not only was the food fresh and tasted amazing, but talk about a healthy serving. It provided me with lunch and dinner. The chicken stir fry has zero complaints from me, even as I was leaving the office my co workers were completely jelly at my leftovers. Love love loved the food"}
{"text":"I was soooo excited to have a pho place by me. My brother and I came fore dinner we both go pho and the pot stickers. First off way to expensive. And I don't like how you have to get your own food from the window. Why am I tipping if I'm getting my own food? I'm not hard to please but man the broth was tasteless. And the potstickers were bland. Just overall not a great experience."}
