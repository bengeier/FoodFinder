{"text":"The lunch combos are no longer available. This means that the price has gone up substantially. The quality of the food has also declined over the last year or so. I was a fairly regular patron for a while, but now I'm done with Sushi Inbox."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this restaurant. I always order Delico and Kamikaze, they are simply the best! Especially Delico, you HAVE to give it a try! I also recommend Novo (cake that's made of eel on rice), also delicious! The price was reasonable, especially if you ordered their lunch special (combo C has kamikaze)."}
{"text":"Got the Novo and Soleil, first one had fish bones in the eel, second one tuna tasted kinda funny. Both had too much fried panko and mayo/sauce. Kinda meh even for fast food sushi."}
{"text":"Was looking for a quick sushi place that makes the food in front of me, with good combos and takeout options and I found one right next to where I work in Montreal. Excellent. I went for a combo and will do that again in the future. Also the place looks great!"}
{"text":"Unique sushi restaurant with a variety of options. Their rolls are larger than your standard roll or there was an option to get what seemed like a sushi cone. The bathroom is a community bathroom between several other businesses and is not necessarily taken care of very well."}
{"text":"Great sushi, perfect for lunch. Had the Vancouver, Crunchy and Special Maki rolls. All very tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Great little wall in a whole place ! One of the rare finds on campus. Price is also pretty cheap, plus they have lunch specials that are total steals !  Discovered it by accident with my girlfriend and now i keep going back !     I suggest if you go, sit down and order the sushi instead of grabbing on the pre-made boxes. They make their sushi fresh and it just taste so much better. On top of that, the service is also top notch, constantly making sure your water is filled and they also start your meal with a miso soup.     As for the quality of the sushi, it's not AMAAZING but definitely not bad for the price and the location !"}
{"text":"After begging my friends to get sushi, we finally stopped by this place on our way to the train station.   Although rather small, the interior was very clean, well-lit and well-decorated - the paper cranes hanging from the ceiling as well as the unique wall art gave the restaurant a cute and cozy vibe. We were originally planning on getting take-out as we thought no restaurant would let us eat in due to our large suitcases but the staff here was very nice and accommodating, letting us store our suitcases on the side while we ate.   The most memorable thing about the food was not the taste but the preparation time - it took over 20 minutes to receive our orders. There's only one \"sushi chef\" so the long wait time is inevitable. If you're on a rush, I would recommend trying one of their pre-packaged take-out sushi boxes.   The food was good but nothing special. I ordered the Sake Epic√© maki and the salmon sashimi. The maki was average and the serving size was quite small. The sashimi, however, was great - I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh it was. My friend had the Shrimp Spring Roll and agreed that the food was good but nothing out of the ordinary. I found the food to be a bit pricey despite the \"$\" on Yelp (maybe I'm just cheap haha) - although the price itself is similar to those of other sushi restaurants I've been to, I found the serving sizes to be smaller than most.  Overall, Sushi Inbox is a nice place to drop by but the food wasn't particularly memorable. I have to say that I did love the decor though!"}
{"text":"Been craving a lot of things recently, but sushi has always been a constant. I think it'd been two or three months since the last time I went out to eat sushi, so I was super happy with last night's supper.  The first thing we noticed when we went inside was the decorations. The paintings on the wall were beautiful, and cranes hanging from the ceiling added just the right amount of cosiness to the relatively small space. There weren't many people when we got there; the two other people in the store were waiting for takeout, so they left soon after we sat down. The only downside about this place were the tables, which reminded me more of the seating you see at food courts than an actual restaurant.  Their service was fantastic; I always say that good service is either so good you notice it, or so good you don't. Here, the waitress made sure our glasses were never empty during the entire meal - sometimes, it felt like I was drinking from an endless cup! In general, they were friendly, helpful, and polite, and I don't ask for anything more.   For the sushi, we ordered three maki and one hozomaki, which was enough to leave two people comfortably full. They don't serve miso soup with supper, which I found a bit surprising. I forget exactly which rolls we ordered, but they brought them out quickly and all at once on a wooden board. The sushi was fresh and tasty, and I enjoyed them all!   Will definitely come back soon when I'm craving sushi - they're located close enough to McGill campus that it'd be a shame not to!"}
{"text":"Only stopped here the once so far, so I'll have to update later, but I really quite liked it! I'd not go so far as to call myself a sushi gourmand, but I've been around the block (and around the Pacific rim) sampling various types of sushi, and this place is good and reasonable.  We ordered a pickled daikon roll, a Vancouver, and a Crunchy, all very fresh-tasting and well-made. I think this is the sort of joint you come to for their rolled sushi (maki), and when I come back, that's why I'll be sticking to.  As to anyone speaking of the quality of their lunchbox takeaway, I'll just say that I've never had notably good takeaway sushi in my life (even after many years in Japan), as it completely defeats the purpose of the food."}
{"text":"Very cheap and very nice! I like their wasabi oil, so much more flavor the wasabi alone. We ordered novo (eel ones), crunchy (medium ones) and special maki (large ones) and my friends and I loved novo most! And it's a good amount, you won't feel too full. The price is so nice. We spent less than 10 dollars for each of us."}
{"text":"Because it is usually quick, quiet, and always tasty, this is my go-to sushi restaurant downtown.  It isn't the most amazing sushi you will ever have, but there is adequate variety, it is consistent, and the staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"All the sushi here was so good. Delicious. I got the crunchy, the Vancouver and some avocado ones. The rolls were fresh, well presented and the staff was polite and inviting. I would highly recommend going here. It's now my favourite sushi place"}
{"text":"Nice little sushi place that distinguishes from the sushi chains.  The good: Sushi usually fresh. Prices are average and what to expect. Restaurant portion of the place not busy at lunchtime. Cashiers usually friendly.  The bad: Choices of already made combos (which is what working people downtown usually go for) is very limited. If you order a special order at cash register, it may take a while before you receive your food.   The three stars limits itself only because when you come in and grab something quick to go, your combo choices are limited."}
{"text":"Had dinner here, a couple of rolls and nigiri.  I was the only one eating there but the take out business was brisk. Very good sushi at reasonable prices. I am very pleased that I stopped in. I am traveling and unfortunately wont have a chance to come back."}
{"text":"One of our favourite sushi spot. The price is very low compare to the quality of food that we were getting. Great service and even greater food! Love their sushi, especially the eel one. Small hidden gem."}
{"text":"A great place to have some Japanese food. It serves a large variety of rolls, sushi and sashimi. The atmosphere is relaxing and the people are welcoming."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and welcoming. We ordered a few different rolls (California, avocado, salmon) - your standard fare but well done. Also tried the Vancouver roll with smoked salmon and enjoyed it. Nice little place. Also offers some pre made sushi for quick take-out."}
{"text":"Really good sushi. Very fresh and tasty. They've got some pretty interesting and delicious offerings. If you love eel, try the Novo."}
{"text":"Sushi Inbox is the best 1 $ sign sushi in downtown Montreal. It's always empty, but the sushi is pretty good for the price, and I'm not picky.  The only problem I have with this place is that going to the restroom is weirdly complex - you take the key, walk down a really long corridor and try to figure out which of the three or four doors it unlocks. Also, the light didn't work last time I was there, there were exposed wires and heating pipes, and it felt like peeing in a cupboard."}
{"text":"This is a really sweet spot for some takeout sushi. I went on a weekday evening and ordered takeout for dinner.   I was immediately greeted by the friendly staff. They asked if I wanted Bento or from the menu, and I wanted the menu items.   I requested crab to be removed from the tayo ozisushi and they removed it with no hesitation. I also ordered the crunch salmon roll (don't remember the exact name) and the kind staff member ensured it didn't have crab in it.   It was ready in less than 10 minutes, and a quick walk around the block made the wait just fly by.   The total for both dishes came to $19, which is a bit on the pricier side I suppose but reasonable for dinner for sure.   The sushi tasted quite good I have to say. Very fresh and flavourful. You can definitely tell when the salmon is high grade and this place does it right! I forgot to ask if they could torch the ozisushi, maybe next time. It still tasted good though!   I was enticed by the high Yelp reviews, and happy to also provide one. I'll definitely visit again for takeout!"}
{"text":"My colleagues and I eat here on a regular basis.  The main reasons: it's close to the office, reasonably priced and the sushi is always so darn good. The rice is never dry and you can expect the same quality each time. My go-to order is the Combo C, which gives you 5 kamikaze rolls and 6 hosomakis, at just under $10 before taxes. If work is paying, I would also get an extra order of tayo which is amazingly delicious but a tad too sweet unless you're having them with the more plain tasting sushis. My other colleagues swear by the spicy salmon and spicy shrimp rolls. Totally recommend this place if you're looking for decent sushi downtown."}
{"text":"Place is empty! The sushi is rather bland No lunch menu! There is a smell that is worrisome! The waitress was friendly"}
{"text":"Craving sushi? Come here for a lunch in a cozy looking restaurant. Nothing very fancy in here, well presented dishes, nice staff, not too crowded. I also wouldn't say that it was mind blowing, but the crave has been filled!"}
