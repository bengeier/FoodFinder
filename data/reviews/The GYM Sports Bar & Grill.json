{"text":"We have been for lunch twice.  I have had the Reuben and the French Dip.  My husband has had the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and the Double Cheeseburger.  The food is very good and served nice and hot.  The portions are large (I have brought half my sandwich home for lunch the next day, both times).  We had the same server both times and she is really nice and attentive.  I didn't notice it on our first visit, but today the music was a bit too loud.  This is a nice neighborhood bar and grill with great food and service. Let's do our part to keep them going....give it a try."}
{"text":"Went to there grand opening and we had a great time great food and service. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Ok. Where to begin!  Went here for the first time today - not impressed.  Bartender, Trent, was more concerned with the cute server on duty than the customers at the bar.  Owner was right there engaging with said bartender rather than encouraging him to interact with all THREE of us at the bar at 5 oclock on a saturday.  Discouraging.
Food was pretty good.  Later bartenders were better but still more involved with their phones than the guests at the bar.
Will give it one more chance.  Dont have high hopes for this place..."}
{"text":"Great local spot. I like it much more than catch 22. Good service, good food. The owner was there talked with him a bit. I'll def be back"}
{"text":"We've been two times now.  Well - three.  First time - was the last day Catch-22 was in business - and now, twice since the space has been taken over by The Gym Sports Bar & Grill.  I have to say - any complaints about staff - I don't get it - that's what has made us enjoy this venue.  From the two servers taking care of us to the genuine friendliness of the general manager that has been there  both times, we have been totally impressed and feel like we've found a new home.  If a game wasn't on one of the screens we were interested in tracking - a quick request was all that was needed.  The food - we've been very pleased.  No - we're not talking Michelin stars here - but - I'm not expecting that either.  Food was hot when it was supposed to be, and not when not!  Last night - we had an order of tater' tots - wow - be hungry - or prepared to share!

We played poker both nights - and the venue is perfect for that.  The wait staff are great to keep circling around - not be interfering - but present so when you'd like something to eat, drink, or be cleared away - they're on top of it.

Both our servers were awesome.  I wish I had kept their names - but friendly, attentive, they remembered MY name, fast....  it doesn't get much better than that.

Can't wait till next time!  It will be a couple of weeks - got some travel coming up.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was probably one of the worst places I've been in a long time the server was  a tweaker.food was all precooked meatballs were microwaved in a bowl very small very tasteless.patty melt was way overdone no seasoning at all on the Burger service was very very bad the owner of this place will not honor local flavor app even when the server was asked if the app could be used she said yes owner said no this place sucks I will never go back there again I wasted my money on a local flavor coupon certificate that I definitely will not use"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place and we all were excited and expected much more when we heard this bar was going in. Looks like they just swept the floors and reopened it and you would still think it is Catch-22 inside. Same TVs in all the same places, wait staff on the floor casually dressed like slobs with no sports themed dress code act like they really don't want to be there and I can't blame them. Went in for Sunday afternoon games bar not even half full. Way overpriced menu items, also if I wanted to pay 11.99 for pasta I would probably go to the Olive Garden instead. Over all no change to the bar. Couple other customers came in when I was there and felt the same way and I know they won't be back. This bar can be so much more and it just Falls flat for me. I see mixed reviews and this Bar just lacks what I'm looking for in a sports bar, this bar has no identity and just an average place to watch games."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Decent bar food. Cold beer.   Place seems nice and clean. I would give 5 stars but do not want to think I am related to the owner."}
{"text":"They offer 16 or 25 oz beers and yet a 12oz beer barely fits in their 16 oz glass. Clearly overcharging their patrons. When we brought it to their attention they just said they must have some glasses that were smaller. Still wanted to charge us for a 16 oz drink"}
{"text":"I have greatly enjoyed working with this establishment. The owners and staff are very kind. They are extremely hardworking and driven. There are many regular customers who rave about the establishment. Stop in and have a drink. Wishing you nothing but success with this venture. Thank you for your partnership."}
{"text":"Grand Opening is Today! I've been here a few times during the Soft Opening and my Wings were good every time. 

Big surprise, my coworker ordered boneless mushroom wings. She loved it. No meat - all vegetarian. 

A lot of menu items and cocktails."}
{"text":"Good food, service, and great atmosphere for sports.  My favorite is the breakfast bowl, wings, & quesadilla.  They have the NFL package and having a contest to pick NFL team."}
{"text":"This is my new go-to place.  I did a google search for \"sports bars near me 85032\" and found a gem.  I wanted to watch the Duke vs. Elon basketball game and called them to see if they have the channel it was on.  They searched, they found, they made me happy.  Their customer service was incredible.  Never in my wildest dreams did I think would be so accommodating...not because of them, but because customer service is lacking in our society today.  Not these guys!  YOU ROCKED IT!!!  I will definitely become a bar-fly at your establishment...for Duke games, ASU, Cardinals, Steelers, and other occasion I can think of.   Remember, I will be buying my spot at the bar and have my Duke bar-stool in tow.  :-)  Thank you again for an amazing evening.  Oh, and by the way, the food was AMAZING as well.  Can't wait for that yummy cookie to be available."}
{"text":"I was in there when the former bar was there. The Gym is much nicer. Unfortunately it doesn't seem busy when I have gone and I am not sure they are going to make it. I hope it does. Stop by for a drink and food.  Help them get this place going."}
{"text":"Love the name! Great food and friendly staff. They also have great specials. Definitely give this place a shot if you are in the area. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Cheese curds are awesome, so is the fries. Got a beer for free, and the attention was great. Definitely we will be back again."}
{"text":"The bar really needed to be wiped off. I was talking to the bartender about the beer I was drinking & she broke off to speak to someone else about someone on the patio. Not sure if it was an employee or a patron she was talking to but it was not good customer service. Atmosphere seems OK. I did not try any food. Will be back to check it out for lunch sometime."}
{"text":"I was there I got really good service the food was good little too salty for my taste but overall it was a good experience"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and after 4 months decided that we should finally check this place out. It was by far one of the worst meals ever. First we asked for chicken quesadilla and they had no chicken. So we got a beef quesadilla which had basically Taco Bell beef on it and was awful. And I asked how the wings are and the waitress told me they were medium size and these were by far the smallest wings I have ever seen in my life and they were awful. I ordered a Long Island iced tea which I could barely drink it was so terrible. The only good part about it was the waitress was nice and very helpful and apologized for the meal and they took care of it so we didn't have to pay for it which I was not asking for. I would not go to this place if you're looking for decent food."}
{"text":"First visit since Catch 22. Loved the mixed drink menu. We loved the pulled pork sandwich and fries. I like that they serve breakfast all day."}
{"text":"The owner and employees are very unprofessional and incompetent  They serve you old food that has literally been sitting there for hours or even days and they are proud of it. They will justify said behavior with excuse after excuse. They called my husband an \"idiot\" for becoming frustrated after being given an entire order of old, non-fresh ingredients. They do not know the first thing about customer service. This business will be out of business sooner than later. I bet they will comment on my Yelp review with another excuse. In 3...2...1...GO, the floor is yours! ??"}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place to open and get a refresh. I go to Casey Jones down the street all the time, but the gym is much closer to my house. Seems they are repeating the mistakes of catch 22... Same atmosphere, same weird couple of locals, nothing jumps out. Food was good, service was good. I still have hopes for this place, but energy was catch. I have faith though... Check it out!"}
{"text":"Place was mostly empty, service was really slow. We walked in and no one greeted us, no sign to say seat yourself... Sat down and waited quite a while for anyone to come over then waited even longer to order food. Lots of TVs in here but many of them didn't have any games on. We had to ask for them to put on the game we came to the watch, which I feel like defeats the purpose of the concept. On top of that, the food wasn't that great."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was sucky and she wasn't good and looked she on drugs I wouldn't every go back The Gym sport bar again"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out since the name was hilarious and near my house. Could have possibly been my go to place. We get there sit at the bar and bartender comes to us doesn't hand us any menus and says \"what can I go you?\" My fiancé orders. I ask \"what do you have on tap? (Keep in mind she's blocking the view)\" bartender says \"a lot\".. so ok..... i manage to look over her and see blue moon so I get that. Brings us the beers and food menus. We order fiancé gets wings I get sliders. We get the food wings had no meat on them and the sliders? They were some of the worst tasting sliders I have ever had. Barely was able to eat one. So we \"eat\" ask for the check says ok. Walks five feet and checks her phone.. so many other places to go to I do not recommend this one at all."}
