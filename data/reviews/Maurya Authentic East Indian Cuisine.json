{"text":"Ordered a bunch of dishes. The portions were large and the service was good, but I didn't love the food. Everything was very salty and the spices weren't blended well - it was like biting into a raw, salted cardamom pod."}
{"text":"In Calgary I have noticed that indian restauraunts come in 2 forms; Terrible and Excellent.  I am glad to say that this was of the later category. I went in with my Dad because we had a cupon for a free entree, I figured branching out would be easier to do if I could save myself a few bucks.    We ordered a few excellent dishes and the only reason that this does not get a 5 star is because of the vindaloo. We ordered the medium vindaloo based on the description of the spice given to us by our server. The first spoonful felt as if I had just opened the ark of the covenant and my face was rapidly melting off my skull.  The server appologized for the heat and explained that it may have been a mistake ( I am very tolerant of heat in my food and love hot sauce, I assume Sulfuric acid made it's way into my food ) and brought some yogurt to ease the burn.    The rest of the meal was impecable. The butter chicken , naan bread , saffron rice and Tika masala were delicious; the Chicken Pakora was the best I have ever eaten.  All around a positive experience and will repeat while being cautious of the vindaloo."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Calgary. It's a family run place with great food. Even better, when I ask for food that's spicy, I actually get spicy food. Win!"}
{"text":"A great family run Indian restaurant, which is reflected in the friendly service and sometimes free extras on slow nights.  The menu covers all the standards. The dishes are nicely spiced when ordered \"hot\", and the meat quality is above par.  I recommend getting one of the stuffed naan breads to accompany your meal, and if you're sitting near the back you get the bonus entertainment of seeing your food being prepared in the tandoor oven, which sits in its own glass alcove adjacent to the main kitchen.  The decor is the standard issue for Indian restaurants...go here for a good meal with your significant other, not to impress a first date.  Maybe a second date, if you want to show them you're keepin' it ree-aw."}
{"text":"So... An hour and counting for food to come. But it only took 45 minutes for them to discover the food I'd ordered was not available. And the long finished drinks brought after we waited for them to notice us have not been replenished. But the server IS walking around aimlessly with a knife so that's... good."}
{"text":"Best Indian I've had in Calgary so far!! I love the food here. Awesome naan bread. Always seems pretty empty so the atmosphere doesn't look great. They were running late on my take away order despite there being not a single patron in the restaurant but I'd definitely go back because the foods great."}
{"text":"I have been trying to find a good Indian buffet in Calgary for a few years. I still haven't found one. I should add the server was very friendly and attentative. But for a buffet all they have to do is be nice and take your plate away.   This buffet had some old rice, passable pakoras, 4 veggie items, three meat items, rice pudding and some melon cubes.   The veggie items were pakoras in yellow souce, chickpeas in a hot \"madras type\" sauce, mushrooms in another red sauce and Aloo gobi - Cauliflower in red sauce. The meat items were butter chicken, and two beef dishes.   Other than the lack of selection, the chick peas and mushrooms tasted the same and the cauliflower tasted like it was in a Ketchup sauce. The Naan bread was passable but drier than I like it.   I don't know how people can consider this one of the best Indian buffets in Calgary. I won't go back unless someone else pays."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very flavourable. Best naan I've ever had.  Great service. Wednesday night buffet is very good and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"i've been going here for years, and it's still as good as ever.  we mostly had vegetarian dishes, all of which were awesome.  pindi chana masala perhaps being a highlight.  butter chicken was good though perhaps not great.  complex flavours throughout the dishes, we loved it.  garlic naan was a winner for us too.  we were there on a groupon and they were happy to have us, and service was good."}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service was awful. There was only one other table in the whole place yet somehow we waited an hour for our bill. The server stood with her back to the floor the entire time so we couldn't flag her down. Takeout from here has been great in the past but I won't eat there again."}
{"text":"I have never fallen in love with food seriously! I have to stop my temptation to go to Maurya again and again. Can vouch for Vegetarian options. Saag Paneer, Malai Kofta. Baingan Bharta are too good. In breads, oh God! It is just out of this world! Their Onion Naan, and Peshawari naan are just amazing! We have always been there at not so busy time so food was always served hot and we enjoyed every bite of meal.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"Love tis place. One of the best Indian Cuisine restaurants I've been to. My hair dresser is across the street so I make it a point to go here every time I see him. The lentils, nan bread, butter chicken and beef vindaloo are excellent. They have a good selection of wines and the service is very-very good! I have also brought friends to this place with me and they have also raved about it. I hope they never close!"}
{"text":"Its been our habit for years now to spend a a few hours on Sundays at brunch. Now, I don't normally consider Indian food exactly Sunday Brunch fare, but my wife insisted she wanted Indian today. A quick survey of Indian restaurants north of Memorial Drive found only one open for lunch on Sunday; Maurya in Kensington. Glad we went. WE enjoyed the meal, the atmosphere was comfortable and the service friendly."}
{"text":"I think this may be the best Indian food in Calgary.  Lnch buffet is way above average, and service is great.  Sometimes not that busy for lunch, but don't be fooled - everything is fresh and very good, and I have been there with many people with different taste preferences and all loved it."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a week night. It was not extremely busy at the time, but had a small cozy feel. The waitress was extremely passive and quiet, but took our order and brought our food out in a decent amount of time. The food was delicious (especially good naan bread)."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years, not sure why I haven't reviewed it yet. This is my go to place for delicious vegetarian Indian! Most of the vegetarian entrees that I've tried have been amazing and my favorite is the malai kofta. The price is a good $10-$12 for veg entrees which can be enough for two people or enough to stuff one. The naan are good but expensive at $4 for a regular naan and also $4 for garlic or onion or other varieties. Pratha is $5 and not amazing, it's small and I've had better. The chai is good, gulab jamun is also pretty good but their appetizers are not appealing to me. I've had their samosas for free when they were really busy and they looked like they were warmed up from frozen and they were small."}
{"text":"When I drafted this review, I gave them a 4 but they're just not consistent.   This place certainly does NOT have the best Indian food in town. I have to say some of the dishes are quite disappointing. However, for some reason I can't stop going back there all because of their Naan and this one dish, gosht shahi korma, that I love so much! This dish has been good most of the times I've been here but it's a turn off when it looks and tastes different every time!  The service is very good!"}
{"text":"Likely the best Indian Cuisine in Calgary, and Indian owned. We had the Shrimp Curry, a.k.a., Jhinga Malai, which tasted so good that it must have been brewed and stirred all day. This is a family working together to play several staff roles at once. Throwaway info: I ordered a Tiger Beer -- imported from Singapore -- and am now a fan of that beer."}
{"text":"I love the food here. I had the vegetarian dishes. They have fresh taste and I can also taste the fresh ingredients in it. I stayed in Calgary for one week and almost every night I had a take out from here. Dal Makhani, Gobi Masala, Bhindi Masala are very tasty. Portion size was good. One order has two servings. Naans were soft and warm. I would surely recommend this place to my family and friends who visits Calgary."}
{"text":"Maurya was a pleasant surprise today, if you haven't had the Indian buffet here you really should.  For $14.99 you get all you can eat dishes and they are all super tantalizing.    Highlights for me today was the butter chicken, the curry chicken, the fresh Naan, a really nice strawberry and cantaloupe salad and two very delicious yet sweet South Asian desserts.  But this is just a glimpse of the over 20 dishes that you can choose from.  Everything is very fresh and delightful; the only staff member out front is the waitress who acts also as a hostess. She was impressively warm and personable.  The decor is just so splendidly elegant, the sunshine strewing into the white clothed covered tables and the pristine crystal is a perfect place for a date or a business meeting or simply just coming in solo and indulging in fine food and peaceful atmosphere. Maurya a nice surprise today."}
{"text":"The food is the very delicious and the service is fantastic. As a vegetarian, I would recommend this restaurant because every Monday evening they have vegetarian buffet at a very cheap price."}
{"text":"First time to Calgary and after a fantastic Sushi lunch at GloveSushi I thought I'd venture for some authentic Indian fare.  My prawn dish was amazing and the appetizer good too.  The best part of all though was Rosie my server who was fantastic.  She filled me in on Calgary and was so attentive and friendly that I felt right at home.  I come back next month and I will be sure to visit again."}
{"text":"And they call the wind Maria... or Maurya in this case. Although, really, wind doesn't have anything to do with this other than blowing whiffs of spice and deliciousness in my general direction.  I've passed by Maurya many a time without acknowledging that it was an East Indian restaurant. But as soon as somebody mentioned the name, I recalled quickly where the business stood.  I was here with some fellow yelpers to try out the Monday vegetarian buffet. It was quiet, but my general impression of any restaurant in Calgary on a Monday is just that, they're all quiet. The buffet was fresh and stocked with rice along with a half dozen or so (it may have been a couple more) dishes of colourful, saucy goodness. I wish I new what was in them, really I do. But my 'buds were satisfied. Note: If you think there's naan missing from the buffet, it's because you've missed it. Turn almost 180 degrees around from the buffet proper and you'll find it there, waiting for you.  We had a delightfully attentive server who, after we had cleaned our plates, encouraged us to go back for a second round to \"get our money's worth.\" She said it with such conviction, how could I not? It was a buffet after all.  My favourite part of the restaurant was actually the room dividers they had along the walls. They were wooden with intricately carved designs on them. I couldn't help but gaze at them every time I walked by. I want some of my own!   The other added touch, chai tea made fresh to finish off the evening."}
{"text":"Remember that time I took a vow to not eat meat? Well, that went out the door when I walked into Maurya.   I literally followed my nose into this place. I was leaving Higher Ground and got lured in by the spicy aromas of the Indian food and I think ghee (a butter-like food). It was after 10 PM, and the sign said they were closed at 10:30 PM. I popped my head into the restaurant and asked if they were still accepting diners? *JOY* They were, and we were promptly seated.   I feel super, extra bad for skipping the extensive selection of vegetarian dishes, and going straight for the meat dishes. And let me tell you, it was worth it for my tummy! The butter chicken was so delicious! It was spiced perfectly and was amazingly tasty! We ordered coconut rice and naan, and the rice was delicious but the flavours did compete, which was our bad--not the restaurant.    The dishes are really well-priced, like $10-14, and the portions are quite large. I ate my butter chicken for leftovers the next day. One of my favourite dishes is a \"salad\" or dip called raita-- it's shredded cucumbers, carrots, onions, spices in plain yogurt. I normally never order it but I was in the mood for some home-cooking and Maurya's raita was just like my mom's! I loved it dearly!"}
{"text":"Started with the veggie pakora and samosa. Both tasted like they had been flash fried from the lunch buffet leftovers that day if not the day before- so dry! Everything else was very disappointing. Service was friendly though so that's a bonus. Most likely striking this one off the Indian food list"}
{"text":"My good science. I really need to stop lurking on East Indian restaurants all the time. Every time I try a new one, it becomes another favourite. This has been the case with Maurya as well.  I have never felt inclined to step into this restaurant, as it has never attracted me from the outside. However, the other night walking home from work I noticed a little sign in the window speaking about a wonderous vegetarian Monday buffet they had. Apparently this is a regular thing. So alas, this evening I dragged my best friend to said buffet. Upon stepping inside we were the only people as it was relatively early, and we got first pick at all the delicious things. Our wonderful and friendly host/waitress actually brought out the chef to talk to me and take me through all the dishes when I inquired about vegan options. It turned out I was able to eat 5 of the 6 curry dishes, and all of the main sides (with the exception of na'an of course, but I am a fan of roti anyways). When the rotis were initially made with butter, the waitress and chef noticed and remembered right away, and made me my own separate little basket of vegan roti and brought it to our table.  The food itself was pretty brilliant. Full of spice. I stuffed my face with veggie pakoras, chana masala, masala potatoes, rice, and roti until I pretty well felt as though I could explore. My friend exploded equally and actually went back for seconds. I wished I'd had room. Not being a vegan, she was able to try the na'an also, and the rice pudding which was apparently the best ever.  To top it off, this all you can eat buffet was only $12.95 per person, likely the best I have ever experienced when dining in on Indian food. Mind blowingly accomodating, affordable, and delicious. Visit Maurya. Take me with you."}
{"text":"We had a team dinner for about 35 here and they had 2 long tables together near the buffet.  The buffet didn't seem large but they offered a good variety.  As someone who can't handle much spice, there were items that I could enjoy.  I had the rice, chicken, cauliflower, and enjoyed the naan bread which they replenished at the tables.  There was enough variety for all the people in our party to enjoy depending on their preference for spice and flavour.  Servers were also timely with refilling our water glasses.  I liked this restaurant as it wasn't too big and line up for buffet wasn't a long wait."}
{"text":"So wife and I used to live in London, where we became huge fans of Indian food. So one Saturday we're in the mood for curry. It was a nice night so we walk to Maurya, the place is half-full. Ask for a table and....FAIL. We were informed the restaurant had just been booked up by a large party for the night. What the WHAT?  Dude was very apologetic and offered a discount if we came back the next day. Well, we weren't in the mood for iNdian the next day. Fast forward two weeks. \"Hey! I could use a curry!\" This time we called ahead to make sure they were open. Score! Surprisingly the place was empty at 8pm on Friday night, but gradually picked up as the night went on. Oh and the food? Double score! We started with some meat samosas and each picked a different entree. I cant remember which ones we had but both were outstanding, accompanied by butter garlic naan and kingfisher beer. We're fans. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We went to Maurya for a group gathering. Six of us packed onto a table crammed in the middle of the restaurants except... there were only three other tables. It certainly isn't a busy night, and the spacing between tables could use a little bit of rethinking.   Food was great, portions are standard fine dining Indian. Beer menu is a bit on the low side but all the standard varieties are covered. Wine menu is much better and it certainly reflects the owner's preference.   I really liked the story about Ashoka Maurya and his reign during the 3rd century BCE. But the restaurant lacks certain finese to deserve 5-stars. Will visit again to reevaluate soon!"}
{"text":"Good relaxed atmosphere. Food quality seemed good. Wasn't wowed by food though. Service relaxing and good."}
