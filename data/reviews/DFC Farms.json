{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere. Really good idea. Staff wasn't very friendly, but it seems like they are still ironing out everything. I will be back, I love to know where my food comes from and they have a great Facebook page which lets you know what's on the menu for the day and who grew it. Good luck DFC, we need to support local independents!"}
{"text":"When food is done the right way -- i.e. without taking shortcuts or cutting corners -- taste and quality really do become incomparable, even more so when a restaurant substantiates itself exclusively with farm-to-fork menu offerings. This is what DFC Farms is doing, so well in fact that business has boomed and partnerships with Queen City favorites like Olde Mecklenburg Brewery and Sweet Lorraine's Bakery have already been realized.  Founded March of 2015, DFC owner Farrah has brought yet another fresh-only, local-supporting eatery to downtown Monroe. Only the 2nd of its kind [to my knowledge], the property follows in the steps of and feels very much similar to the town's prototype Stone Table situated but a couple blocks away. Though both are essentially the same in terms of concept and execution, what DFC has that Stone Table doesn't is space... accommodations are abundant (tables, high-tops, bar & outdoor seating)... not to mention atmosphere plenty (live music, \"Meet the Farmers\" nights, weekend brunch events, monthly highlight nights).  General service and waitstaff amiability are equally generous; conversations are fun and energetic, and it's very apparent just how passionate everyone -- from Farrah to any of the servers and especially to DFC's executive chef Don -- is about utilizing the finest ingredients around for genuinely top-notch new-style Southern dishes.  FYI... (1) like/follow on Facebook -- 'DFC Farms Trading Co. & Caf√©' -- to keep up w/ weekly happenings; (2) expect menu changes daily/weekly/monthly; (3) SUPER reasonable prices + HUGE portion sizes; (4) WiFi available; (5) typical market goods throughout the restaurant are all available for purchase; (6) alcohol coming soon; (7) extended hours also coming soon; (8) discounts for Wingate students also coming very soon; (9) street parking; (10) the restaurant's already been featured in numerous publications -- sweet deal!  Rating specifics (i.e. 1-5, low-high)... - Overall recommendation = 4.5 - Food taste and quality = 5+ - Portion size = 4.5 - Price = 4.25 - Atmosphere = 4 - General service = 4.75 - Waitstaff = 5 - Location = 3.5"}
{"text":"Farm fresh, menu changes daily based on what's available fresh, who could ask for more? The staff is friendly and very attentive to your services. Check out their Saturday brunch always great. Get there early cause once it's sold out its gone. Sides are awesome."}
{"text":"Looks like it would have been good and was excited to try it out coming down from DC, but call ahead because their stated hours don't really reflect if the kitchen is open. Queue sad trombone"}
