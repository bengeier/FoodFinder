{"text":"I can't believe there's no other reviews on here for Hometown! This is the best pizza in the Moon area period. They are the go-to for us when we want awesome pizza. We do like some of the other options around here as well, but Hometown Pizza is by far the family favorite."}
{"text":"pepperoni rolls are awesome! tons of good food to pick from. friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of pizza unless it's brick oven but this place was very good! Took about 40min which is what they told me on the phone."}
{"text":"I got the Italian Hoagie and Wings deal.  The wings were awesome, the hoagie was ok.  It was a lot of food.  Good value.  I'd try them again.  The only let down was I specifically asked for extra knapkins - and I didn't even get one.  But I did get a stack of paper plates.  O well, the food was good anyway."}
{"text":"Website is misleading.  They DO NOT deliver to the geography shown on their website.  If they are sloppy on such simple details I don't trust them on the more important ones.   Genuinely too bad as gluten free delivery is rare around Sewickley and would seem to be a good business."}
{"text":"Our go to for pizza delivery! Good service and fast. People are nice and will work hard to make your order right. We love the pizza of course, the chicken spinach and feta is excellent as well as the chicken ranchero. The rolls are also great! My wife loves the spinach and feta, I'm more partial to the pepperoni rolls. Either way it is a wonderful pizza delivery for the Sewickley area."}
{"text":"Pizza's always delicious and friendly team. I always order from them all the time pizza is hot even when i do delivery. Thank you guys you are the BeS"}
{"text":"Hands down, this place serves the Best local Veggie Pizza. Delicious, not frozen and fresh veggies!"}
{"text":"I have order Gyro spacial twice its a really good deal for $11 but the fries is brown too brown like too cooked the second time over the phone I wanted to make sure it's fresh fries. It did happen unfortunately. But they have the best gyro ever! And pizza. Very fast delivery and very nice people."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this restaurant twice, and was pleased both times.  I ordered pizza the first time, and sandwiches the second and all were good."}
{"text":"one of the best GF pizzas I've ever had! I had spinach & feta GF pizza.  Very,  VERY delicious!  I've bookmarked them for future Pittsburgh travel! Pizza was delivered to my hotel in 30 minutes,  not the 45-60 estimate,  and it was hot & fresh.  Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza!!! Love this place, everytime when i am i Pitt trying to get their food. Place is realy nice and clean, prices are reasonable. Highly recomend!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite places to eat in Moon twp. I'm actually addicted to the grilled chicken salads. But I also love their pizza and hoagies. My daughter likes the wings. If I could eat a salad daily I would. I eat from this restaurant so much they already know how I like my salad. I wish I could give them more then 5 stars. Great service, great pizza just a great restaurant"}
{"text":"I decided to give them a go and guess what- i am soooo glad i did otherwise i would have never known what kind of place this is!  Ok so let me start with saying that its a really cute cozy pizza shop where you actually get the sense of hometown atmosphere!   Pizza is delicious!!! I mean it! For collage students and people who like to have big parties and not be embarrassed i would say Pizza DeCasa! Love the pizza crust and sause is also  smth different!  I dont exactly know what they have but they have smth addictive about their food, i ordered from here once and now i am a regular! Try and give it a chance and they are there to impress you!  And by the way food came piping hot and the driver was extra nice as well!"}
{"text":"As a patron of this establishment's predecessor, Hometown Pizza, I am thrilled that they're still doing their pizza and cheesy breadsticks the way I remember them!  The staff is constantly polite and have always had my order ready to go when they promised it would be! In addition, this tiny little joint is incredibly tech savvy. I really enjoy the convenience of ordering my pizza via the app!  If you're in the mood for a little slice of heaven, and appreciate the experience of a mom and pop pizza shop, I highly recommend you pay this Moon Township staple a visit!"}
{"text":"To start They turned down my normal delivery special. Countered with a one topping large which I was fine with. Pizza came at a reasonable time. I was informed the pizza was $11, so I gave the guy $15 and he just starred at me. And I asked where's the change? Then do you have change? He replied with \"no change\" then I said yeah I'm owed $4 if the bill was $11 I get $4 back because I gave you $15 then he again responded with \"no change\"?? Then awkwardly handed back my $5 bill which left him with $10 and my bill wasn't even paid for. So now I was very confused because I always tip and now as the buyer I'm uncomfortable Bc I didn't know what to do and I still wanted to tip the guy for his efforts. Finally after five minutes of confusion and his misunderstanding on how change works I'm like you know what just keep the $5 and ended up paying $15 for one pizza.. So I was over that by now and ready to eat. The topping we chose was pepperoni and I'd say on the whole pizza there was maybe 7 total pepperonis on an entire pizza. Then the cheese was sliding off on almost every slice we grabbed. Also o. my previous order a few weeks ago my breadsticks were burned and my guests weren't pleased, as we all chipped in money. I think I'm done ordering from decasa for a little while. The whole process from bad communication to the inconsistent product I'm gonna try pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"Officially the best pizza I have tried in Moon!  It is really good and is cheaper than everyone else as well."}
{"text":"We ordered from here while we were visiting Pittsburgh. Seriously the best pizza we've ever had. They had a lot of different specialty pizzas, we got the seafood pizza, the Ranchero pizza, and an antipasto salad. The salad was fresh and loaded with extras. Their house ranch is delicious!!! Cannot wait until our next trip to Pittsburgh to get this pizza again!"}
{"text":"Ordered the gyro special for delivery tonight. Quoted delivery time was 45 minutes, food arrived in 30. Driver was very pleasant. Food was terrific. Order was accurate, gyros will require a second attempt, fries were hot and crispy. Job well done."}
{"text":"We found out this place delivered to my work. Not many places that serve real food deliver there, so we were excited and ordered lunch. The order went through, they charged the credit card, wait was estimated about an hour. 2 hours later we called back and they told us they dont deliver on whatever day it was. We complained on the website and they said 2-3 business days later they'd take the charge off the card. I never did get to try the food, but they really need to get it together on their website so to keep this from happening"}
{"text":"Oh my, I can't say enough good things about this place. We are remodeling our house and have no kitchen right now. Food here is all good; fresh salads that are huge, spaghetti and meatballs was wonderful, we have really liked everything we have ordered. Even the delivery people are nice!"}
{"text":"I order from here frequently as they are close to where I live and one of the few places that delivers. Recently their delivery has been getting and later. This evening I ordered food through this app with a tip included and while they say it should take 45-60 minutes it took over an hour and a half. I finally called and they just forgot the order and said they were closed. They offered to deliver the meal but it would take an additional half hour. They lost a customer today."}
{"text":"Good food with quick and friendly delivery. I got the chicken carbonara and garlic bread - portion was generous and arrived piping hot. Prices are reasonable too and I appreciate that the delivery minimum is just $10. Would order again."}
{"text":"Best Gluten Free pizza in the area! It's pricy but worth the money.  I think they are remodeling or something, so don't judge the food on looks of the store.   I voted 4 stars because the delivery driver was parked in the handicapped space, which is really a shame."}
{"text":"Very good pizza.  We have been searching for good pizza since we moved to pittsburgh.  Will definitely order again.  Friendly delivery man, great chewy crust, nice tomato sauce.  Fresh ingredients. Liked pizza better than calzone."}
{"text":"Great pizza! We're staying in a hotel nearby and it was an appropriately delicious choice. Not knowing what to expect after our last yelp-approved restaraunt experience and weary of faked reviews, our expectations weren't high. Luckily, this time the reviews were accurate. The ingredients looked fresh and the taste reflected that. Would definitely order again instead of greasy, but reliably tasty fast food pizzas."}
{"text":"Thhhhhhhhe perfect pizza. As a DC resident on business, I was sad to leave. He pizza was the perfect thickness, generous on the extra cheese and super nice staff. Everything they make is fantastic. Veggie hoagie on point, as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely love pizza DeCasa. Best pizzas around (especially their white pizza) and their Italian hoagie cannot be beat. They load it up with lots of goodies! I love their buffalo chicken house rolls too!"}
{"text":"Formerly know as hometown pizza, this is some of best pizza you can get in Moon Township. With several awards reflecting its pizza and service, Pizza Decasa is a must try if you are in a mood for a good pie. This mom and pop business keeps up with the latest technology in which I was really surprised the accepted apple pay."}
