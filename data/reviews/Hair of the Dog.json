{"text":"I am a big fan of this place, especially with the renewed focus on the menu. In the winter the the pub is very cozy and relaxed, a nice place to spend a coupe of hours with friends. In the summer there is one of the best patios in the city that lets you watch Church street walk by.   The beer selection is solid with a number of local and international craft beers on draft. There are also a number of excellent bottles. The mixed drinks are good, ask for the Glee made by David for a fun multi-colour drink."}
{"text":"Went in for an almost-midnight snack for our first visit. The chicken fingers and fries were the best my boyfriend's ever had (and he practically lived on chicken fingers for a while). The nachos were cheesy-good with freshly made chips. The prices are a little high, but the atmosphere of the place and good service make up for it."}
{"text":"Service is very slow. They cannot handle a Saturday crowd. It would be better to turn people away than have people wait. We are getting drunk due to lack of food. Help!!!"}
{"text":"Okay,when we had to wait 15 mins for our drink order (not even a glass of water) we knew we were in trouble. Service was abysmally slow although they explained (only later) that they were short-staffed. They still had more staff than we see in the other restaurants in the area. Food was ok, but again we had a long wait for the bill. Had to ask twice for it. Not worth the noisy atmosphere nor the slow service."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I like the cozy feel.  I like the easy, no-fuss atmosphere.  I like the super friendly service.   I like the coffee refills, I like the Caesars, I like the food.   I like the mini muffins that come at brunch.  The only thing that I don't like is the location, and nothing against the area, I just wish it was closer to me so that I could come here more often."}
{"text":"Did they become dumb?! I've eaten in this place tens on times. I eat out a lot. Yes, their food is good compared to their price and the location is convenient. However, staff currently working there are the most stupid people I've ever seen. The girl who works there can't serve people (which has always been so, we just try to order from bar and avoid her) but what happened yesterday was really unacceptable.  My friend had problem breathing and high palpitation, we asked them to call us an ambulance. THEY REFUSED!!!! I would sue them if I were a lawyer. After we called 911 on our own, and when paramedics were on site they showed up with bill and their bank machine! I still can't believe these people and don't know where they come from, but what they did was far from being acceptable.  Hopefully my friend is fine. It was a food poisoning."}
{"text":"I went here because I heard it was great for brunch, but my friends and I thought it was more of a 'meh' experience.    The good:  - The patio is LOVELY on sunny morning - The staff and service were great - They bring you little muffin bits as a freebie before you order  The 'meh': - I was underwhelmed by the limp only partially-cooked bacon, I like it crispy - I found the sweet potato fries way too greasy for a breakfast item. Home fries are usually a bit more potato and a lot less oil, which makes them more palatable for breakfast.  - My husband had the breakfast pie and thought the bacon, ham, and poached eggs were great but the potato (which makes up much of the dish) was undercooked.   - They serve biscuits instead of toast, and I would have liked to have some jam on it, but that wasn't an option."}
{"text":"We were in town for 10 days and this by far was the best place we ate at. The staff was extremely friendly, the atmosphere was welcoming and the food was wonderful. We ate both breakfast and dinner here and the desserts were to die for."}
{"text":"Was in town visiting and stumbled upon this gem. Walked in right as it opened up. Our bartender/server gave us great service and the food was to die for. It had a really cool vibe and tons of pictures of dogs/things to look at."}
{"text":"Hair of the Dog has an intimate atmosphere, friendly staff, absolutely fantastic drinks... and simply just a great part of the neighbourhood. It has two patios, one on the lower level, one on the upper level. It might be hard to get a seat on the patio in the summer months, but you can always grab a fantastic Caesar and wait inside until a space frees up on the patio.  And yes, they have a fantastic Caesar, honestly I think it is the BEST in Toronto. I know that is a bold statement. I eat out A LOT, and I always get a Caesar. So far, nowhere has a Caesar as amazing as Hair of the Dog. And their secret is.... wait for it.... Frank's RedHot instead of Tabasco. Yep, now you know.  In terms of food, I order one thing and one thing only... Southern Fried Chicken! I love fried chicken, and eat it way to much. I have a weakness for simple comfort food, dressed up. Their fried chicken is moist and incredibly juicy on the inside, with a well seasoned crispy coating. It's typically served with mashed potatoes, which I always substitute for sweet potato fries, and a side of chipotle mayo.  This is an excerpt of my review. For a full review and photos, please check out my blog. Thank you for your time.  http://simplygluttonous.blogspot.ca/2013/07/hair-of-dog.html"}
{"text":"As a local, I like coming to this bar/restaurant because it has a relaxed atmosphere, offers a large selection of drinks, and has pretty good food! This pub has 2 floors with plenty of seating. Decor is very dark but it adds to the cozy/intimate atmosphere. There are many pictures of dogs on the walls, which I find cute. Staff are friendly and willing to recommend beers based on your tastes. They offer many local brews but also some imports as well.   I have to say for a pub, I'm really impressed with their food menu. I've had a few dishes here but I really like the perogies the most: great flavour and perfectly cooked (tender). Their desserts are tasty as well and change with the season.   The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because I saw a rat running out of the kitchen once... It was the summertime and the patio was open so maybe it just snuck in from the outside, but it left me feeling somewhat icky about the food I was eating. Overall, would recommend!"}
{"text":"With the help of Yelp located this nice little place after a big day at Niagara falls. Service was amazing and food was great. Tried poutine for the first time and was impressed. Also had the fried chicken and the corn bread was delicious. The wife had the jambalaya and said it was sensational, very large meals. Would recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"I've been to Hair of the Dog quite a few times. I've always wanted to give it another chance. Unfortunately, it never meets even mediocre expectations. I've given up on this place now.  Yesterday I went for brunch with a friend and we were seated upstairs at a table that smelled like stale beer. The restaurant was pretty empty. The food was very cold when it arrived at our table. The cold breakfast potatoes also had a sour taste. The only good thing about our experience yesterday was that the server was friendly and attentive enough. Can't say the same thing about every prior time I have been to Hair of the Dog...the service is usually awful."}
{"text":"This place was near our hotel and had pretty good reviews so we thought we'd check it out.  We  just ordered a couple drinks and appetizers.  There was a surprisingly good beer selection and the food was excellent.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"We were in for brunch yesterday and really enjoyed it. I had the vegetarian frittata (sp?) which was okay and my girlfriend had the Easy as Pie which she LOVED. Our server, David, was super cool and is the reason this is four stars instead of three. Good times."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on the Saturday of a long weekend with friends and had an enjoyable enough experience. The food was decent - not out of this world, but good. Two of us got the big breakfast (the standard eggs, ham, bacon, sausage, homefries, etc.) and one of us got the breakfast poutine. I had some of my friend's breakfast poutine and much preferred that over my own dish. The caesar was good enough, but I'm not sure it was worth all of the hype. The patio was nice, but the interior was dim, so I'd recommend going on a sunny day like we did and sitting outside. Our waitress was nice, although a bit absent minded. Having said that, her quirky and cheerful personality made up for it. I'd return and give this place another try for sure."}
{"text":"I don't get why the hype is about. Yes, they do have a good selection of beers but the food is average. Service is average. Ambience is average. Location is average. I went with a couple of my friends and we sat outside. The weather was nice and it was pretty full outside. We noticed that there was a baby mouse running around below our table. A bit freaky! I ordered the fish and chips which was two small pieces of heavily fried, oily fish and lots of fries that weren't tasty. Get ready to eat alt of fries. Ended up paying $30. Definitely not worth it. Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"I had brunch. It was some sort of breakfast pie, which was okay, but I'm giving a 4 based on how delicious my friend's homefries were (tasted like bbq chips) and how good the eggs benny looked at the table over. Also, as has been mentioned, the service is really top notch - the servers are friendly and talkative. I will be back!"}
{"text":"It's a nice place but I gotta say the food is over priced. They get busy but only one waiter from what I can see. Have been there many times. But always had to wait to get served. The last time I was there, waited for over 15 mins. No one serves us. No water. We decided to leave. Won't return again."}
{"text":"best tuna melt I've ever had. Amazing patio."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  Food is what you would expect.  The beer on tap and bottle is pretty good as well.    This place is pretty accommodating to groups or small parties and it has a really good atmosphere.    The waiters can be passive aggressive sometimes but overall it's pretty good. I'd definitely it'll recommend checking the place out."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review having only experienced a small part of the business so I suppose you should take it with a grain of salt.  I went here for drinks and dessert with a friend because it is rare to see Delirium Tremens on tap. It's one of my favorite beers, so of course I ordered it. The beer was inarguably watered down. I don't claim to be a beer expert, but I do love beer, and I especially know Delirium. And yeah, it was watered down (probably because it is an expensive beer, and 9% alcohol).   Aside from that, the service was good. Friendly server, (he also made me and my friend a Frulirium at my request, which is Delirium and Fruli mixed). The dessert was good, and the atmosphere is nice, too! I'm sure if it went for a brunch and perhaps dinner I would be giving a 4 star, but this is just my experience. And watered-down beer is not cool."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the atmosphere once we were seated on the upper patio. Food was great, servers were friendly and overall a nice spot to spend part of our Friday evening.   If you arrive with a group of 6 or more tip will be automatically added to your bill (which we noticed before paying). Our server did point this out while we were paying so bonus points for that!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place for brunch while my husband was at a business meeting.  I googled \"best Caesar in Toronto\" and this place popped up.  It did not disappoint!  The Caesar was, in fact, perfection.  The food was great and the waiters were very personable and funny.  If you are looking for a great Caesar, great food, and fun atmosphere, this is it!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good but location and building a challenge for anyone with mobility issues. The only washrooms are on the second floor. There is street parking but we ended up in a paid parking lot across the street. The decor is okay. Framed cutlery is used as pictures on the second floor. My grandchildren thought this interesting. Overall a good experience but as a mobility challenged person I would not be returning on my own."}
{"text":"Delicious food, Small but excellent tap selection, great patio and superb service. Thanks Ravi!"}
{"text":"Great fish and chips.  $5 pints of the house beer--okay okay, so this beer won't win any awards, but is refreshing enough on the cheap.  Also crab ravioli and fresh mussels on the menu.  Haven't tried the cocktails, as they sound sugary and gimmicky.    Consistently friendly and cheerful staff, plus a really nice summer patio.   I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Great spot. On the patio.  Excellent service! David our server was amazing! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great drink selection. And were able to accommodate our friends soy allergy."}
{"text":"Great patio and bloodies! The food was good, but didn't knock my socks off. I had the black bean wrap - if was an interesting mix of flavors... I had a couple of bites of the butter chicken grilled cheese too. That was pretty good, very rich."}
{"text":"Well known for its patio, atmosphere and location does not disappoint. Hearty fare, and a long beer list, but unfortunately the seem to have run out of several brews when we stopped by."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pub for the food and atmosphere.   I love the homemade nachos that they make.  You can get it served with shrimp or tofu.  For breakfast, I recommend their banana bread french toast.    Unfortuantely, they don't serve escargot anymore.  This is the first place that I've tried it and I love it.    There is a lot of candle light and the artifical light is dimmed.  The mood seems cozy and intimate.  This is a great place to go out with friends, or even to take a date to."}
{"text":"I was traveling through Toronto and this bar happened to be near my hotel and open at 1AM.  We just stayed for one drink at the bar but the place was very impressive. It was clean and the bartenders were very friendly and helpful. The beer menu was quite extensive - all the beers had clear prices, descriptions and alcohol contents listed. I went with the \"Fruli\" - which was a a white beer blended with strawberry juice. It was smaller than a normal beer but was absolutely delicious. I'm glad this was our last stop, as this beer was so good but probably too sweet to order another. I think they sold food here too but it was so late when we got there I'm not sure."}
{"text":"Great place to spend an evening with good friends!  My family just went there and we were  seated on the side patio.  It was a perfect summer night in Toronto.  We drank a variety of beers.  I loved my Fruli!  The nachos were very good with the toppings and sour cream and salsa.  They are made on dry pita chips.  We ordered the fish and chips, the butter chicken grilled cheese, and the southern fried chicken.  All were good but we agreed that the fish and chips were excellent.  I'm glad that I ordered the grilled cheese, it is unique!  I just found it a little richer than I wanted after eating other appetizers.  It should definitely be ordered if you visit!  Our server was extremely helpful and friendly.  I look forward to returning in the future."}
{"text":"We had terrible service here. I think our waitress was on coke. The food and drinks were a bit overpriced and underwhelming. The patio is nice, but that's the best thing they have to offer."}
{"text":"Great choice for brunch as well as drinks. One of the best places in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Best in the summer time for weekend brunch on the side-street patio. Menu and Food is so-so inside."}
{"text":"The Hair of the Dog has once again made my experience exceptional. I've been dinning at the Hair of the Dog for almost 10 years- as I walked in I was immediately greeted- David Diaz is such a gem. It's been ages since I've been by and not only did he remember me but with a hug and smile he sat us promptly on the patio- in the spot he remembered I loved. \"Two Caesars?\" He asked. Yep! (also impressed that he remembers my favourites). The nachos are delicious. The patio is perfect, covered in gorgeous vines, a fountain and shade from the hot sun. Although it's been awhile since I've been back to one of my favourite restaurants in the city, Dave made me feel like I was a regular again. My guest loved it and we enjoyed the best Caesars in the city over a delicious plate of nachos. Service was incredible, friendly and cozy. Dave- you rock!! Looking forward to next time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places downtown! The patio is awesome when the weather is nice. The beer selection is great, pub food delicious and staff & atmosphere makes it one of my favorite pubs."}
{"text":"Something really happened to this place over the year. Came here for brunch last summer/fall and had a really well made dish - Eggs Benedict. Flash forward a year later, my friend is in the city and we decided to try this place again since it was close to my apartment.  Ordered a bacon cheeseburger and fries for lunch. In all honesty, the burger was very mediocre. No seasoning, not very hot, tasted like freezer burn - what an awful aftertaste. The fries were fine. Drinks were good.  I would have given Hair Of The Dog a generous rating since I had a good brunch and good service a year ago, but what really hit the nail on the head was our awful server. this time around. Never checked on us often, and cashing out was way too slow.   My friend and I asked for the bill to be split. I paid for my meal with my card, he paid with cash for his meal. He left a decent but small tip for our waiter considering the mediocre service, and we preceded to leave. The waiter decides to come up to me and ask \"Did I do anything wrong\". He then asked for me to give him a tip. First off, I was flustered since my friend already covered the tip for the entire bill, but for a waiter to forwardly ask for a tip (despite already getting one) was tacky to say the least."}
{"text":"This is a great place to chill and grab sound good, easy food and drinks on an awesome patio.  The staff is nice and helpful, as well as easy going.  No stuffed shirts here!    Their nachos are pretty great.  They make their own tortilla chips which makes them different than most.  Their food is comforting and simple.  Perfect for an easy weekend meal."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in the Village. Brunch is wonderful, and if you're there for dinner, I'd recommend the Southern Fried Chicken or the Butter Chicken Grilled Cheese.   Request to sit in David's section if he's working. He's wonderful. A few nights ago I arrived with 7 people (and no notice) and he managed to do some rearranging and squeeze us in -- even though it was the middle of Pride Week. Love him!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Ambiance is super chill and everyone's awesomely nice. Staff are cool and make you feel like a regular. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is my steak was good but not the best."}
{"text":"Now that I've finally gotten around to writing reviews again, I can't believe I never reviewed HOD in the first place.  This is been our local neighbourhood haunt for years. They have some great beer choices on tap (Mill St. Organic or Grolsch are usually my top choices) and an extensive cocktail menu. The service is always top notch whether you're dining, drinking, or both.  When the sunny patios a little further north on Church start to fill up you may be able to sneak onto HOD's garden patio on the south side of the restaurant. The view is unfortunately to a crappy parking lot across the street, but luckily it's designed so that you can focus internally on the other patrons or your own table.  Unfortunately I have had to dock 1 star because the food quality has decreased significantly since we started hanging out here 5 years ago. Their old chef left and since then the dinners have been hit or miss. The menu is pretty eclectic, I wouldn't say it follows any specific food trends. Let's call it comfort food for all occasions.  If you want to visit in winter I find HOD always exudes a cozy, homey, warm atmosphere. Maybe it's those thick red curtains just inside the door or the large, awkwardly-shaped tables we seem to inhabit when there are 8-12 of us sharing an evening of drinks. Maybe it's because we have been getting served by some of the staff for years.....HOD feels like home."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. I always get the perogies; they're my favorite in the city. The chicken and waffles are great too. I don't think there's anything on the menu that I've tried and haven't liked. I love going here for afternoon caesars as well. The patio is really nice in the warmer months and the inside has a nice ambience as well. I took off a star because I once saw a mouse on the patio and it really freaked me out, but it is outside so there's not much they can really do. It hasn't stopped me from going back."}
{"text":"Came for brunch with my sisters and mom on a busy saturday.  Friendly staff were able to help quite quickly and the food was excellent.  Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place! I was here today for Sunday brunch. Upon entering, I was immediately greeted by a gorgeous blonde girl with a  killer smile and friendly demeanor. I opted to sit at the bar since I was alone.  David, my server, was there quickly to take my drink order. They offer a lot of beers I've never seen in the States, and I chose a Sleeman's Original Draught. The description made it sound like it would go well with the crab cakes Benedict I planned to order. BTW, the beer descriptions are great, and the description was perfect for the beer I ordered.  My food was delivered rather quickly - and by the cutest guy.  He even checked back later to see how I liked the food. He was still really cute.   Two perfectly poached eggs were atop crab cakes and with just the right amount of a perfect Hollandaise on top. To do such perfectly poached eggs and that tasty Hollandaise? The cook definitely knows what s/he is doing.  While the food was excellent, I really have to commend the staff here. They were all on the go, making sure customers got food and drinks quickly, and they did it with smiles and personality. And my gawd, they're all so damned attractive!  A special shout out to David, who is funny, sweet, adorable, and even gave me a suggestion for a place to visit that evening. He made a visitor feel very welcomed, and I greatly appreciate that."}
{"text":"Came here late one night for drinks (didn't try the food). Everyone's drinks were fantastic and the bartender was friendly and gave great beer selections. Found my new favourite: whatever their apricot beer is! Amazing! Four stars only because it's a little pricier than I prefer."}
{"text":"Went here late at night with a big group that kept growing. The waiter was really flexible with us and kept bringing food and drinks as needed. Didn't think the food was that great but LOVED the fun drink names, as other reviewers have noted."}
{"text":"How fob am I? I knew \"hair of the dog\" was some kind of expression but I had to go to my second fave website to find out what it meant. Oops.  With that said, I can certainly see myself coming here for the hair of the dog remedy. I can also see myself getting super intoxicated here that I *would* need a hair of the dog as well. It's like one of those places that would never criticize your alcohol intake the night of, or the previous night. Thank you, non judgmental enablers.  The interior is really nice and chill. I went in the evening and it was perfectly lit for ambience. I'm sure it has a different but good daytime feel as well. They've got a decent selection of beer on draft and many martinis (which I see are well-received by Yelpers) that I have yet to try. I  am actually looking forward to going there for dinner someday soon, see how these crazy kids do up an entreé... Or you know, just wind up here for my next drunken debauchery.  Atmosphere - 5/5 Service - 5/5 Food - yet to rate! Price - 3/5"}
{"text":"The food and hospitality were excellent.  The two bartenders Firmo and Sesar provided excellent service as I was sitting at the bar.  Thank you for an great 2-3 hours."}
{"text":"Westvleteren XII... Great food and friendly service. Can't ask for much more. This location is full of big characters and amazing staff. I would eat here every night except that I travel 1300 miles to get here."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The ambience is great and the service is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This was a great bar and is worth visiting if you are touring Toronto. They had a decent beer selection. The inside of the bar was really neat and they have a great patio to sit on. I didn't eat any food- but it's a great spot to grab a brew. I'd go back if I'm ever in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Hair of the Dog is dark, comfortable, quaint, homey and romantic. It is the perfect place to go with some close friends for a catchup and to drink coffee drinks with booze in them. Or wine! as they had a decent list and the prices are good. Cute second floor which I did not notice until I had to visit the ladies, which is a shame, I would have loved to sit up there.  Really friendly staff. Really cozy and comforting vibe. Will return."}
{"text":"cool ambiance. Had the butter chicken grilled cheese which was pretty tasty. The service was friendly."}
{"text":"This place serves some great brunch.   In and out door seating,  the outdoor seating has a very nice look to it.  Pretty friendly staff.    They have some really delicious sandwiches with some great looking bread.  Everything seemed very homemade and fresh.  The bread they used for the sandwiches tasted and looked ssssooo good.   I got a Mexican style breakfast with poached eggs salsa and guacamole serves on a crisp tortilla.  It was such a great idea and very tasty.  The guacamole was also awesome.    Servings are a hefty size with a decent price.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Good service, nice patio outside for the summer. Nice and friendly ambiance. Can be a bit louder in the summer being right on church street. But a great neighborhood to be in."}
{"text":"Pretty decent pub. Great spacious patio, small selection of beer and the food is about average, but it's really about the space, patio and atmosphere.  Good if you just want to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Imagine sitting down in a group of six....ordering a few beers...then being told that a) they won't split a bill b) they tack on a gratuity c) then being ignored the whole night d) finding the tacked on gratuity is 19% e) never going back to Hair of the Dog again.  Food was decidedly mediocre...good fries though...specialty coffee's were overpriced and just brutal (we ordered four different ones and nobody was happy with theirs)"}
{"text":"Hair of the Dog is like Toronto's version of Cheers. The staff is attentive and the meals are plentiful."}
{"text":"Great food and great village location. Patio usually full so plan to get there early or be prepared for a bit of a wait. Fantastic fun service. Good portion sizes."}
{"text":"Good selection of beers, great food, good ambiance, nice patio.  Definitely worth a visit, though going too often may break the bank."}
{"text":"Cute, but kind of dingy. Got the butter chicken grilled cheese with fries. Definitely good but nothing extraordinary. Typical bar type food."}
{"text":"Good place, nice martini's and brunch on Sunday it's my favourite on the patio. I love the fries and the location is very convenient just a few blocks from my place. Service is very good too."}
{"text":"Originally came here for the Crab Cake Benny, but I miss it by the whiskers and came here a little too late for it. Determined to try their crab cakes either way, I got the crab cakes as an appetizer. The crab cakes were delicious, crispy on the outside and moist as well as flavourful inside. I can honestly have a plateful of them. Also had to get the Hair of the Dog Caesar since it's named after the place and I've heard great things. I haven't heard wrong since the Caesar was delicious. I ordered the mac and cheese as the entree and although it was good, it wasn't amazing. The portions were great. The waitress was attentive and the atmosphere was rustic as well as cozy."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Service was excellent and quick. I got the breakfast poutine which was so amazing. Now I want to go back and try another dish."}
{"text":"Definitely some pluses. Great patio. Washrooms were pristine and the service was friendly and attentive. Located in the same building that once housed the storied Bigliardi's steakhouse for all you old school Toronto buffs.   One major problem: the Big Breakfast for $14  When I eat anything called the Big Breakfast I expect to be at least reasonably full for my money. Wrong.  I got it with scrambled eggs I am pretty sure that I only got 1 maybe 1.5 eggs. I know what 3 eggs scrambled looks like and that wasn't it. Barely a palm sized serving of home fries.  The \"two strips\" of bacon was actually 1 full slice of bacon cut in half. The sausages and the ham were small. If that was their idea of a Big Breakfast then I would hate to see the standard sized breakfast.  One should never have to order a second full meal at another restaurant less than an hour after eating something called the Big Breakfast but that's what I had to do once my group arrived on another patio across town.   Other than that its a decent place just not hot on the value so if management is reading this please be less stingy with your portions!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service amazing patio outside and great bloody Caesars And a great selection of martinis. And their cheeseburgers are the best."}
{"text":"I cant understand the 4 star rating of this place. We went as a party of 3, were seated right away. Ordered some Caesars, the Caesars were quite good. For food, we got the butter chicken grilled cheese sandwich, the huevos rancheros and the pub breakfast.   The butter grilled cheese sandwich was tasty. The huevos rancheros is a dish of 2 poached eggs on 2 large tortilla chips with sour cream and guac and some salad leaves and fruit. For 12$? I was still pretty hungry after my brunch.   The patio is nice on a summer day and a good spot to have a few Caesars or beers. I wouldn't get anything else here.."}
{"text":"Great patio and food.  Check out the Nachos for a unique experience."}
{"text":"We stopped by this place for the first time after I saw the write up on Yelp. I had the Crab Ravioli which I recommend you skip. The Crab tasted like canned shredded meat (I think it was crab) and the ravioli was like cardboard with just about as much flavor. I tried the Terrace/Vale Semillon/Sauv Blanc and it was VERY bland. My bud had a martini there which he said was average at best. There are definitely better places to be on a lovely sunny day. Go for a nice beer and skip the food/martinis. Nice patio, reasonable service ..."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for Sunday brunch while visiting Toronto this past weekend -- good food; very friendly service; and the inside is cute and cozy ... perfect for avoiding bright lights if the night before was just a little too much fun!"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto on business and visited HOTD for lunch.  The service was excellent.  Really cool vibe in the restaurant.  Gorgeous patio.  Food was great (I recommend the Fish & chips and the Wellington Russian Imperial Stout).      When it came time to pay, I had a problem with my credit card and the staff was not only gracious about it, but let me use their phone & laptop to call my bank and sort it out.    They couldn't have been nicer.  I can't wait for my next business trip, so I can pop in again...Maybe check out their night-life scene this time :)"}
{"text":"I had an UNREAL dinner here a little while ago. UNREAL.   I tend to order pasta in restaurants. I just do. I just love it. So I tend to at the very least enjoy whatever is placed in front of me. However, this dish knocked off my socks! It took an original take on pasta with cream sauce and sundried tomatoes- a combination I already devour on a regular basis. Damn, maybe soon I'll step out of my box. Maybe.   So this penne had sundried tomatoes within the sauce, spinach, portabello mushrooms, SMOKED gouda cheese and SMOKED chicken. Unlike some places where the descriptions do not match up to the final product, this dish was to the t and delicious. The smokiness really came through in the tender chicken and there was enough of everything to pick up something for each bite along with a noodle. Ah, it was a good sized portion and I finished it.   I also got to try my friend's pasta as well, the special of the day. She's a fancy one. It was shell pasta with pesto, shrimp, mussels and mushrooms. So good too! Shell pasta might just be my new favourite- the little ones- and I can't wait to scoop some up during my next grocery trip. They collect everything so nicely. As expected given the quality of my own dish, this one's flavour was top notch too.   The space, vibe and being downstairs really added to the experience of food. You have to take stairs to hit the washroom so I saw that it was much quieter up there and not as dark and romantical. Our waiter was very nice and on top of things like water refills, though I did appreciate the wine bottle of water that was never left dry at our table. I loved that the waiter gave us a moment to actually taste the food before shoving a gigantic peppermill our faces. Because after a bite I can actually consider if I want said pepper, as opposed to just guessing. I am definitely coming back and like I said, maybe I'll expand my horizons from pasta."}
{"text":"By far my favourite hangout...food is excellent and staff are the best...they actually can recommend from the menu which something nt so many waiting staff can do now a days!"}
{"text":"Three words- have the Caesar. But have other drinks too- you won't be disappointed. If you're feeling peckish, you can safely order almost anything on the menu. I've had most of the entree and appetizer section and have been disappointed once, with some undercooked fish, an error that was corrected after I pointed it out to the friendly server. Of course, don't expect five star food- this is a pub, after all- but as far as pub food goes, it's very good.  The baked potato skins are enormous and tasty, with just the right amount of crisp and flavourful toppings. The bangers and mash make a filling, comforting dinner- perfectly complimented by a zingy Caesar. I have one complaint- please bring back the incredible Greek salad. This was taken off the menu recently, for reasons I cannot begin to comprehend."}
{"text":"A great find in the big city. I was meeting my sister for her birthday and she suggested this as a good place to start off for a drink. I actually used to work near by and didn't know about this pub. We tried a number of others nearby and always wanted something else. I really wish we had found this earlier it is just a great place for a drink or a meal.  Now it wasn't really patio weather when we went but it looks to have a nice one and will be sure to check it out ASAP. The service was great very nice people and the drinks where tasty and fun with name reflecting the village."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Sunday afternoon. It was freaking delicious! The menu is very different, lots of new exciting things to try. More of a fancy spot as well - not your average patio thats for sure. Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This place used to be much better.   The menu seems to have changed - they used to have Mac and Cheese with chorizo that I'd have cravings for. When I last went I asked about the chorizo and was told - \"can't you read? No substitutions\" Nice.  A big change from the previous time I went at lunch and was told that \"Mac and cheese (with chorizo) was only on the dinner menu but I'll get it for you anyway\".  I had the butter chicken grilled cheese which is advertised as possibly the best grilled cheese you've ever had. Actually, it was the worst.  This, coupled with the extremely loud \"head banging\" music inside that made conversation just about impossible, made for a lousy visit."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio! Poutine was too soggy for my taste but was good otherwise. The beer I had (some kind of dark stout) hit the spot. The server was very fast and friendly.  Inside there were plenty of people enjoying the AC on a hot summer night. But back to the patio... Most of it is covered so if its sunny, you should be able to avoid getting burned while you enjoy their food and drink.   I'd definitely enjoy coming here with a handful of friends and passing the night with good conversation and even better drinks."}
{"text":"We were on the patio last night. It was a gorgeous warm night. The service was fabulous, our server engaging and helpful. The food was fine and the beer cold....  Great evening. The patio filled up around 6pm, so I was happy to have gotten there a bit earlier.  Entirely enjoyable."}
{"text":"15 drafts on tap, outdoor patio. Got full on the chicken liver pâté so didn't have room for much else, but enjoyed a hot toddy over nachos for dinner. Very standard pub fare. My partner and his friends had burgers which were huge. the waiter had good recommendations for beer but also seemed impatient."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere.  Food and beer was great.  Our waiter David was awesome and super friendly.  Will definitely return!!!!"}
{"text":"I have had mixed experiences at Hair Of The Dog over the years. Sometimes it's a wonderful experience with great service and other times it's quite disappointing.  They have a decent beer and wine selection, and tons of patio space (two floors). The food can be hit or miss, and it's quite expensive for what you get.  A solid three stars, and one of the better restaurants in the area for a bite and a pint. I would come here a lot more often if the food was more reasonably priced (just my opinion) and the service more consistent."}
{"text":"I had a great time at Hair of the Dog! It'll definetely be a go to place! It's warm, cozy and the staff were great and very friendly. The lay out was nice; we sat up stairs in a nice corner, I would suggest getting a light cardigan because it can get a bit chilly.   The food was good, we ordered a hair of the dog burger and sirloin steak. I would definetely recommend the burger to any burger lover, I added brie cheese and mushrooms and it was delicious.  I haven't tried the steak but the presentation want bad!   I highly recommend the place, if not for food then for the vibe specially that they had good music on the back ground"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place for a brunch if you are to lazy to dress up fancy for the posh ones.  Mr.H and I grocery shop nearby and wanted to get a good breakfast before that. I had heard a lot about their Butter Chicken Sandwich and boy was it good! I entered and knew I wanted that and Mr. H got a veggie omelette. We all know who's was better! Butter Chicken Sandwich won hands down. Now it didn't taste exactly like it but close enough, it was loaded with cheese so make sure you're hungry when you try it.  My only issue was that it looked a bit dingy to me but hey! Its a pub right."}
{"text":"An essentially perfect bar and restaurant. The atmosphere is welcoming and relaxing. The music isn't loud. The lighting in dim. The food is great, the beer selection is great. The staff are great. Can't get enough."}
{"text":"Portion sizes were pretty good, we had the fish and chips and the fried chicken. Food was pretty tasty, and we felt welcomed to stay and chat even though we finshed our food. Servers were friendly, and food came relatively quickly. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Great ambience, great service from warm friendly bartenders. My fiance and I loved the joint! They have a good selection of beers on tap and bottled as well, all very fairly priced. The caesar, as per review recommendations was wonderful! Highly recommend getting it with the bacon vodka.  We had the chicken pate ($8). It's a great little sharing plate and is perfect for snacking with drinks.  We shared the butter chicken grilled cheese ($14) as per everyone's recommendation. It was delicious. The butter chicken wasn't overpowering and was very tender, I'm not sure we particularly like our indian food with beer as a pairing, which took away from it a little bit I think.  The star of the show for us (aside from the caesar which we loved) was surprisingly the fries!!! Wow they were ever tender, yet crisp, and full of flavour and potato-ey goodness (for lack of a better description)! We had to have an extra order! Yum yum.  Would defintely come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered to roast beef. The beef was tender, gravy was fantastic, service was excellent. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Very cool vibe . Great , I mean really great beer selection and very friendly owner and bartenders who know their beer and enjoy talking about it. Great food and intimate atmosphere. Highly recommend hitting for happy hour or dinner anytime you are in the area."}
{"text":"On a cold Saturday night, we found a gem!  We were staying nearby and wandered in (after checking Yelp).  The place is warm, comfy, and friendly.  We sat upstairs, which was spacious, and were waited on without delay.  I enjoyed a Lake Effect IPA with my fish & chips and partner raved about the burrito (and he rarely raves so this is quite an endorsement!).  We would definitely return if we are in the area again."}
{"text":"Great place with great brunch options. I liked their eggs benedict. Their scrambled egg was a bit overdone. Caesar was a bit too spicy for my taste but other than that it was good. They have a nice patio in summers with lots of plants."}
{"text":"Had lunch there on Sunday after the pride parade. We were a group of 10 and they were able to accommodate us at 1 table with very little wait time.   We're ordered 3 or 4 pitchers of red and white sangrias...delish! Around the table, there was nachos, poutine, perogies, butter chicken grilled cheese on challah ordered... and folks enjoyed it.   I ordered the southern fried chicken with gravy, mash potatoes, mixed veg and jalapeno corn bread. The chicken was slightly salty, crunchy and boneless which made it easy to eat. Mash potatoes were creamy and the gravy was the perfect complement. The jalapeno cornbread was crumbly, soft  slightly sweet with a touch of heat.   Overall food was delish and it was a fun hangout spot...I'd give it a 4.5!"}
{"text":"This was the third time here and I have to say, the last visit was disappointing. I ordered salmon and the rice was cold. The creme brulee was lumpy and there were few decaf options for me. We let the waitress know, but after we paid our bill. The service was great!"}
{"text":"This place is home to the best Caesar in the city. Even the pickle is delicious (yeah, it has a pickle).   I always order the pecan soy burger which never fails to impress. Had some of my buddy's nachos that were a bit disappointing, but even bad nachos are good, right?"}
{"text":"Best patio in the village. A cute oasis with proper brunch.  They have really nice bathrooms- which is surprisingly important.   The waiters are always super friendly and have never gotten bad service or bad food.  The fee banana bread slices during brunch are a great touch."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC place in the city with a great partly shaded patio - not necessarily for people watching as it's on the side of the restaurant but great atmosphere.  The beer selection is good and not too expensive, martinis are fruity and one of the best caesars in the city! An excellent and fairly broad menu including good nachos, great huevos rancheros for brunch and mac and cheese is sooo good. I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has become my work's go to place for a lunchtime bite and a drink. I have also brought a couple of friends here on other occasions. First of all they have great patio and that's what originally drew me to this place. What kept me coming back was their food and drinks. The butter chicken grilled cheese is a must try. It is so unique and oh so good, you will not be disappointed. An excellent item to share is their nachos because their nacho chips are unlike any I have ever had at another restaurant. They make them in house and they are more of a pita chip than a nacho chip. They also have a very big drink menu especially for beer and cocktail drinkers. Their caesar is worth getting, it's one of the best I've had in the city. Also the delirium tremens beer, it's strong, but it's good. Not all bars carry it, so when they do, they already get a star from me."}
{"text":"Awesome nachos. The chips stay satisfyingly crispy, even under the wet ingredients. Probably the best nachos I've had anywhere. The great beer selection and attractive location don't hurt either. I keep coming back here."}
{"text":"Put a dog on your logo and I'm there.  I came in here when the Leaf's were playing so the place was fairly empty. Odd though, since I'm used to overly-crowded pubs, especially during playoffs. I liked that it felt cozy and unpretentious, though that could be because hardly anyone was there. Service was prompt and my southern fried chicken was delicious.  Best part of the meal was that the purchase of my beer donated money to the local shelter. Did I say I'm a sucker for puppies?"}
{"text":"Super bar situé dans the Village, quartier gay de Toronto. La terasse est magique et vous donnera une vue sur les tours illuminés de downtown. L'ambiance à l'étage est un plus intimiste et conviendra à la clientèle voulant prendre un verre au calme.  Awesome bar located in the Village, the gay district of Toronro. HOTD has an awesome patio with a gorgeous view of the downtown towers; For the customers looking for a more intimate atmosphere the tables upstairs are perfect."}
{"text":"I've been in Toronto for pretty close to a week and have been there every day.The first day I ate and had an amazing Caesar  loaded with cucumber cherry tomatoe dill pickle olive horseradish and spices, it is absolutely delicious . I have had one or two every day.The food is also very good the butter chicken grilled cheese is to die for. I love The Hair of the Dog."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is great. The food is so yummy and its such a cozy place"}
{"text":"This place used to be my favourite bar. Cozy and quiet atmosphere, a great selection of beers, and good food. Good place to have a pint."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere: good music and also good staff. And of course lovely food and drinks. I had the salmon with rice"}
{"text":"Making a perfect Sunday afternoon...  Cozy trendy pub like atmosphere Lots of different types of beer on tap at a reasonable price.  Glasses are chilled.  Also, I love it when a bar uses the name brand glass for the draft beer you ordered.  We wanted to try a new beer... and without asking the waiter offered us a few samples!!      Recommendation; The 2oz Caesars looked amazing for $7 bucks.  Can't wait for the summer so I can check out their amazing two story patio!!!   Freakin' delicious Start with a Bloody Caesar What a patio!"}
{"text":"Looking for a great brunch or a tasty casual dinner place with a top-notch kitchen in the village, and maybe a place to chill on the patio with drinks and/or friends in the hot weather?  Hair of the Dog is just such a place. Inside, it's dark, inviting and very comfortable - good atmosphere for a pair or small/medium group. There's also a quieter upstairs space. Outside (maybe better for bigger groups) you can sit on the bright, breezy patio, though it is right on Church so you might hear some traffic noise. You can order one of the many cocktails (they feature some great names and inventive flavours) or pick from the decent beer and wine lists. The service is prompt, attentive and friendly.  As for the menu: it's fairly sizeable and has lots of good stuff to choose from - you'll probably be torn between a couple of the options that include burgers, crab ravioli, steaks and chicken dishes, pastas, mac and cheese, even curry... but their jambalaya really won me over. It's a must-try.   The brunch menu is similarly well laid out - Benedicts, hearty skillets and breakfast plates with the works, as well as indulgent stuff like pancakes and French toast. They do a nice poached egg, whether you order a Benedict or any of the other egg dishes like the awesome Rancheros or the interesting hybrid breakfast that is the Easy As Pie. Echoing other reviewers, I'd suggest trying one of their excellent Caesars!   I'm really going to miss eating here after my upcoming move. It's a place where pub atmosphere gets taken way beyond the usual standards of fried, boozy and decidedly average."}
{"text":"Really was not impressed.  Had really disappointing food toooo many times  The beer selection is great, but I have given up on the food.  I do not plan to go back."}
{"text":"Walked by once or twice during the week (visiting for work), and went in for brunch on Sunday.  I wish I had gone in earlier, fantastic place. Clean, comfortable, friendly, overall brilliant place.  The layout makes full use of all the indoor space, it feels much bigger inside than the outside makes you think it will be. The decor is very appealing, and they don't overdo the clear theme of the place.  The staff are attentive and friendly, they get major bonus marks for pace of service.  The food was most excellent. One of my friends who was eating with me (we were a group of three) is the harshest food critic I know, and he was very happy with his meal (a feat most restaurants fall very short of achieving).   I drank at least four cups of coffee. Normally I may drink a half cup before changing over to water. The coffee they serve is fantastic (our server stated that they had recently changed suppliers and that this was even better than the last brand they were serving), unbelievably fantastic.  After tip with no alcohol (although that was an option for brunch) meals came out to about 20 $ each. A value that makes me say this is not a cheap place, it is a proper location that wants you to return in the future.   All three of us have full intentions on returning to this location when we pass through Toronto next."}
{"text":"1 word ... meh.    Cold Chicken Nachos:  a scalding plate does not mean the food will be warm!  Those raving about the nachos must be newbies who've never been out before, I've had better at airport Chili's.  Generic magic-bullet veg with COLD chicken (actually, the whole middle of the food was cold).  Awesome beer selection?  Without a doubt.  I enjoyed the German Smoked Beer.  The bartender's immediate removal of the nachos from the bill would have bumped the rating to a third star for good service, but lost one for not venturing a suggestion when I mentioned being undecided between 2 selections."}
{"text":"This place was exactly what I wanted in food and atmosphere! The food was so delicious that my friends and I went on and on about it. It is a cute up-scale pub beautifully decorated. And the staff? The staff were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. Recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Big beer list, with lots of different beers both in bottle and on tap. Focuses on bigger micros including some fun ones from Belgium and Quebec. Service is good but ... abrupt. I've heard mixed things about the food, but won't comment until I have it again. Decent watering hole in the village."}
{"text":"This is a great local watering hole. Has great deals for drinks and a solid selection of beers on tap. The food was standard pricing for downtown but was quite delicious. Service was very friendly and the atmosphere was cozy and intimate making it perfect for a date or intimate conversation with friends.This is a great local watering hole. Has great deals for drinks and a solid selection of beers on tap. The food was standard pricing for downtown but was quite delicious. Service was very friendly and the atmosphere was cozy and intimate making it perfect for a date or intimate conversation with friends. They play a nice selection of music which creates a very mellow atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love Hair of the Dog. Why?  Well, I probably visit an average of once a month and always enjoy myself.  First, the food is good and tasty! And they have several vegetarian options (I think only the vegetarian burger is vegan, though), GOOD vegetarian entree options. You can add TOFU to quesadillas and curry for the same price as adding chicken. They have a tasty veggie burger. They have several veggie apps. All in all, this is a good place to go to if vegetarians and meat-eaters are dining together. (Please note: I haven't eaten brunch here since their menu change so I can't comment on the brunch food, it used to be GREAT).    Second, the staff is typically attentive and friendly. I don't know if they're technically allowed to, but staff have altered food on request for me and they keep the drinks coming quickly.   Third, the beer selection is great. They tend have my standard favourites available, including Mill Street Organic and Blanche de Chambly.   Fourth, the ambiance is way more restaurant than pub. Which means you can also take a date here.   Fifth, the prices are not the cheapest in the city but overall, they're VERY reasonable.   Lastly (and in the spirit of summer), the patio at Hair of the Dog is fantastic. Tables are not too crowded, it's just off the main drag, and there is a nice mix of shade and sun most times of the day.   Hair of the Dog gets two thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"Went into HOD after along day of solo travel in the rain and snow and was seated at the bar per my request (the patio was closed).  The bartender was very helpful and suggested some favorites.  I went with the Butter Chicken Grilled Cheese sandwich.  Good flavor and an overall solid sandwich with very crisp fries, just the way I like them. The beer selection on tap and by the bottle is respectable for the size of the bar.  I did not have any cocktails, but there is quite a selection with I am sure something for everyone. I will be sure to stop by the next time I am in town when hopefully the patio is open."}
{"text":"Average, nothing that would get me to come back.  Arrived at about 2:30 on Saturday for brunch - website says they serve brunch until 4, but handwritten sign on the door says brunch served until \"3ish\".  We weren't greeted by anyone so we were unsure if it was seat yourself or not, finally we just took a seat and waited for someone to acknowledge us.  This was probably due to the fact they had only one server on for the whole place (and he played bartender as well).  Started with Caesars.  They were good, not great, and ended up being $9, so totally overpriced for what you're getting.  I wasn't too impressed given all I'd read about them.  I had the red pepper and goat cheese omelette with a side of sausage.  I got about ten homefries, and they weren't hot at all.  Sausage was good, side salad was good.  I noticed other people's plates being brought out of the kitchen chock-full of tons of the sides, and wondered what I'd done to get so little?    Asked for a coffee but it never came.  Overall, brunch for two people (each got one dish with an extra side, and a Caesar) came to almost $60.  Totally not worth it."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and relaxing outdoor seating. Sweet potato fries are excellent.  Burger was cooked perfectly and our orders arrived timely and hot. A nice place to chill and enjoy conversation. Other entrees passing by also looked great."}
{"text":"so being the tourist that I am, I yelped a brunch spot near my hotel. Found Hair of the Dog.   Well, I was not disappointed. I found the staff just awesome. There isn't enought words to explain that great service they provided. There was a hiccup with a broken coffee machine but it was fixed. You can tell the staff was experienced and really cared about the patrons. And the food was delicious! Ordered the Easy as Pie. Amazing! Wish I hadn't found this place the day before flying back home. Definitely going back when in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Walked in about 10:00 am Saturday morning, no customers so I asked if they're serving breakfast, they said yes. Two staff in the front, one seated me and I waited and waited watching one of tthe staff looking at her phone.   Finally asked I'd they had coffee on, she disappeared to the kitchen, returned empty handed and returned to her phone. After a reasonable wait, I left and told he to forget the coffee. Sorry, I can't rate the food as I don't know if they have any."}
{"text":"I like the location and feel of HOD and the host was friendly. The food is good but pricey for what you get. The service was not bad, but not great. Our waitress didn't crack a smile the entire night and looked like she was going to go postal at any moment."}
{"text":"Eh, the best Caesar salad in town? Maybe I'm not a salad expert so I didn't have the Wow moment when I tried.  The fried chicken was good. Crispy skin and tender soft meat. But the chicken had very large piece of skin attached to it. I'm not saying it's not good, some may think this is the best part of fried chicken but considering the portion of the dish, I'd rather trade that giant piece of skin for a bite of meat. Surprisingly very small portion... Well you could get full by finishing the lump of mashed potato but the three tiny pieces of chicken.. Oh man, let's go to Popeyes afterwards..  Overall it's okay, not amazing, probably not coming back"}
{"text":"This historic house-turned pub can be thought of as three restaurants in one.    The main floor has the makings of a boisterous bar, with patrons and staff engaged in laughter and conversation.  The upstairs dining area is usually quieter and softer in feel, perhaps a good spot for a romantic date.  In warmer months, the huge outdoor patio has the feel of a garden party full of friends, with all the benefits of enjoying Toronto's urban vibe.  The food is excellent.  Pay particular attention to the salads and sandwiches, with the vegetarian burger being one of the city's best.  The beer selection is good, though lacks a decent microbrewery selection."}
{"text":"I've been there on and off for over a decade. My friends like the servers that are eye candy to them. I feel the food is overpriced considering the quality and quanity of it."}
{"text":"Came here a couple months ago for a staff dinner. Decor was cute! I love the dog theme (I'm a sucker for dogs ) - from the menu to the wall decor!   Ordered a couple beers - no complaints about that.  Food was mediocre. I can't remember the name of the dish but I got roasted vegetables and steak. The veggies were good but the steak was disappointing. It was dry, and horribly seasoned - or not seasoned at all. I'm horrible at making steak, but my steaks were way better than this.  Service was good and bathrooms were clean :) i can't stand filthy public bathrooms."}
{"text":"Good: Nice ambience, a pleasant place to have a long conversation in the afternoon. Very friendly and prompt service. Mediocre: The food--my eggs benny was dry and the eggs overcooked, and the hollandaise was way too mustardy. Also, there was a weird and pervasive smell throughout the lower floor (where we sat because the upstairs wasn't open). My recommendation would be to go in the evening for drinks and sit upstairs. I think it would be a great place to hang out with a group."}
{"text":"Brunch is spectacular.   they redid the washrooms- they are great now.  love this place."}
{"text":"Probably my new favourite bar/restaurant that I discovered recently! The atmosphere is interesting - relaxing and a bit romantic with enough dimming of the lights, unique decors and great music. Our server was super friendly and cool, and the food was just as amazing. Their beer selections are also good and I thoroughly enjoyed my entire experience here."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday around 6pm with my girlfriend and we were interested in appetizers and drinks... let me tell you about their crab cakes... WOW.  Get them.  Do it.  SO GOOD.  Top 3 crab cakes i've honestly ever had (comes with 2 medium sized ones).   We both opted to get the beer flights!  It came with 4 mini beers, but was a good opportunity for us to try a variety of beers!   The strawberry rhubarb was one our favorite beers!  Also, their was one with grapefruit - I cant remember the particular name, but it was very yum.   The service was very good and our waitress was nice and attentive even though she had all the tables on our side outside to attend to.  It was fully packed outside when we went and no one was really inside, but still a good vibe!   I wish we tried more food, but next time!  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Another review is not likely needed given the 38 others, but I'd like to add my two cents.   I was really looking forward to trying this place out and while it wasn't horrible, it certainly was not worth the price!   I had the pork chop special  for $18.50 and while it was tasty, the portion was tiny. Like fancy-high-class-leave-you-hungry restaurant small, and without the quality! (the broccoli was great though). My friend ordered the butter chicken. He reported good things, but again, it wasn't half the size you'd expect for the price. We shared the calamari which was mediocre..the description made it sound creative and delish with some sort of wasabi dip, but it did not deliver! Not sure where the wasabi ended up but it wasnt on our plate.   Service was really good...until the very end when the credit card machine prompted me to tip \"20%\" or \"other\" ... Now, I follow the rules w tipping, and I liked the service so I planned to give above 15%, but an automatic 20% prompt just ain't classy!   I'll go back for the location, patio and ambience, but it'll be for a drinks and fries kinda thing, and not till I've scouted out the ample competition nearby!"}
{"text":"This is my closest neighborhood pub and it's one to be proud of.  Great patio in nice weather..  Like: the reasonably priced beer and drinks, great staff / service, and the amazing food choices / quality.  I highly recommend the unique nachos.  Dislike: being charged for extra condiments, like sour cream, when you don't get much in the first place.  Also can be busy at times, but that's due to it's popularity and quality."}
{"text":"Very nice space, good service,  mediocre, unremarkable, acceptable food. . The food has always been alright been at least 6-12 times and never had a dish or appetizer that I thought was good. I dont come here for the food.   You come here because its a nice place to go. Its lovely to sit either indoors or outdoors. Nice place for drinks, brunch, lunch, dinner, Pleasant atmosphere,very nice space. They say that it was owned by the owners of the old FAB magazine, but thats just what I've heard.  not good value, fairly expensive for what you get. Entrees are 13-21$, should be 8-15$ imho Drinks are also going to be fairly pricey."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, but not so wowed by the food. Had the potato skins appetizer and the bowl of mussels. the mussels came in a nice sauce, but quite a few of them had sand/hard bits in them. And despite the potato skins being loaded with toppings, I found that it lacked flavour.  Maybe a good place to hang out and have some drinks, but I wouldn't return just for the food."}
{"text":"This a small bar on Church Street that my girlfriend and I went to mostly because it was close to the restaurant where we ate dinner. There were a ton (pages) of beers on the menu. We didn't try the food but honestly it didn't look like anything spectacular - just typical bar food. We got cocktails and wine. Prices were reasonable. Ambience was cozy and candlelit with an average noise level (quiet enough to carry on a normal conversation comfortably). Upstairs looked nice as well. Beware of the VERY small bathroom."}
{"text":"Whoa. this place is great!  I went at an odd time, mid afternoon so the place was quiet, and easy to find.   Had the potato skins, and the Butter chicken grilled cheese and they were awesome! and both surprised me.   the potato skins were presented more like a cross between loaded fries and loaded potato skins, such that there was a bowl full of strips of potato skins, and then dressed with toppings! it was perfect.  the grilled cheese was so nicely cooked, with the bread golden brown, and a good amount of cheese and meat. It was so different and wonderful. oh yeah the fries are great too  I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Over living in the area for the last 3 years, I have come to call hair of the dog my local.  I have to say, they've got all the good stuff a pub should have-a wide variety of beers on tap, good wine list, cosy atmosphere, nice patio for the summer months and bartenders who know how to make a decent martini. 5 stars you say? Yes. The staff. I'll drink a warm beer in a shitty alley with my friends, but now I go to hair of the dog. Always friendly, warm and welcoming, not an easy task in our ever expanding city. Knowledgeable about the drinks and their menu. Professionals to the core, I've seen them deal with some real idiots with nothing but class and grace. These guys are problem solvers. I couldn't do it, Kudos to them.  ...side note, David always makes me laugh, you'd do well to sit in his section. ..."}
{"text":"In terms of strictly brunch (all I can review) - this place is perfect.  Attentive servers, great atmosphere (not just for dog lovers, the theme just adds another element), great menu, great food, great portions, just great.  We were there on a quiet rainy Saturday at peak brunch hours.  The food was perfect - went down easy with all the coffee refills.  They could tell we were in the mood to linger.  Bottom line - great Brunch - would definitely go back.  The Pie in the Sky - looked / smelled awesome would reccomend it (I had the vegetarian frittata, which was splendid).    oh - and the sliced banana bread pre brunch sampler was just icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"It seems every time I go to this Resturant they never have what I want on the menu. This was the third and final visit to this Resturant. Strike out!! To top it off, my table saw a rat run out of the back by kitchen (we where not the only table that saw it too - we looked over at another table and the lady had her feet off the floor - cuz it scared her too)"}
{"text":"Patio and food is amazing and really creative. Great in the summer.  Weird hybrid pub + restaurant. Total pub feel but village vibe. In Toronto, probably the BEST pub food around. Drinks priced well for the area. Decent service. Definitely a favourite of mine."}
{"text":"Had the Butter Chicken Grilled Cheese. It wasn't the most amazing thing out there, given that there are a lot of amazing Grilled Cheese places. It was pointed out that it was the best thing on their menu. A large serving with fries!"}
{"text":"From the minute we walked in we had incredible service. The bartender makes probably the best Caesar that I've ever had in Toronto. On top of that the food was great and they served really large portions. Will definitely be coming back for another Caesar!"}
{"text":"Good casual environment, had awesome air conditioning on a hot day. Above average beer selection. Enjoyed having there bar specific beer hair of the dog lager. Perogies were delicious, all covered in onions and bacon! Very unhealthy, but perfect for a tasty treat!"}
{"text":"Been on my list for a while and finally made it here on the hottest day this summer!   Was easy to make a reservation and on Wednesday afternoon, the patio was comfortably full and we had a great time, drinks and catching up.   Drinks are average price, and they have their own craft beer. I was also able to get half pints of strongbow $5.25  I love the patio here, the stone tables are something different (and HOT after a sunny day) and two levels, lookout out onto a quiet street (albeit a parking lot) is very nice too.   I didn't find the service particularly slow or quick, but liked the server although we didn't chit chat much.   We were deciding on the Ploughman's appetizer and after asking exactly what it was,  it seemed for $14 I can hope skip and jump to the Loblaws and do this myself. Instead, we opted for the Potato Skins (as per Brian K's review) $8 and a MUCH better worth your money and excellent choice.   The potato skins were fried with real cheddar cheese, real bacon bits and green onion smothered all over. And sour cream for dipping. If you're going to indulge in fattiness like this, do it here. We shared this, and the Butter Chicken Grilled Cheese on a toasted Challah (not really, just egg bread). The sandwich was okay, nothing special though, still tasty, but wasn't like I had imagined.   The Fries on the side was yum with a cajun spice all over it. Wasn't a fan of the coleslaw.   We had a great time, and sorry to the quiet couple beside us cause I think we were talking really loud (AC, you're like typical asian man loud) and laughing!"}
{"text":"Out with a few friends I ended up here on a whim. I LOVE this place - extremely delicious cocktails...hot tranny mess is delicious.   The food was fantastic...nachos are seriously out of this world and I say this as someone who finds nachos a pretty dull affair! Steak was cooked perfectly!   The staff are friendly and great fun! Best night out I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"I can definitely understand why some people give this place a 3 star review.  I had the nachos with chicken and guac.  The tortilla chips are home made and had a really nice variation in thickness that was surprising.  The portion was massive.  I ate too much and unfortunately didn't have room for sticky toffee pudding.  I was a solo dinner and the staff went out of their way to make me feel like I wasn't a total social retard.  The beer list is amazing.  I didn't have the burger but I'd stay away from it.  The menu has plenty of other options."}
{"text":"Came here during Pride weekend to have a drink with some friends. We were very lucky and seated very quickly on their super cute patio. They have really great beer/drink selections, and the food is also quite good (my friends had a Butter Chicken Grilled Cheese and a Grilled Chicken Sandwich and they enjoyed them). The staff taking care of us was super nice, and I really enjoyed the relaxed vibe of the place. I would absolutely return :)."}
{"text":"We came to Hair of the Dog for a late lunch on the Sunday after Pride at about 3pm. As they were transitioning to their dinner service we had to wait about 30 minutes before  we could order food, but ordered drinks in the meantime. Their beer menu is large and sports a number of great brews on tap (Beau's Lug Tread, Blanche de Chambly, St Ambroise Oatmeal Stout, ect.) and even more great beers by the bottle including a gluten free option (Bard's Gold Gluten-Free). They even have one of my favorites from the states, Anchor Liberty Ale. We sat in their patio area which was nice, not only because it was covered but had shrubbery and small plants throughout creating an intimate backyard terrace feel. When we were able to order I had the Butter Chicken Grilled Cheese. Meh, it was OK. The cheese reminded me of the cheese you get from Pizza Pizza, i.e., rubbery and bland. The service was great but based on my meal and the feeling that everything was 2 or 3 dollars more expensive than it should be (ex. $14 for Chicken Club, $17 for Southern Fried Chicken, $19 for a Black Bean Burrito with Beef)  I will try elsewhere next time I'm in that area."}
{"text":"This place was seriously incredible. Came here on Easter for brunch, and everything was superb. I got the crab cake benedict with a side caesar salad and I'd say it was some of the dankest noms I've had in Canada. The crab cake tested so fresh, the egg was perfectly poached, and the salad was made with arugula which I absolutely love. The bloody caesars were also sooooo delightful, with delicious pickled vegetables and lots of flavor. They also brought out some fresh warm muffins which were sooooo tasty and paired perfectly with my coffee. I tried some of my cousin's breakfast poutine that had butter chicken and was interesting, but also quite delicious. We sat outside and it was an ever-so pleasant experience overall. Would definitely recommend if you're in Toronto."}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 6/10 Drink: 7/10 Service: 5/10 Value: 6/10 Hygiene: 2/10 Aesthetics: 3/10  Good food , good drinks.. lots of seating upstairs. My  only compliant was the mens room it smelled like a dog or cat took a long piss everywhere. The smell was so unbearable I had to hold my breath."}
{"text":"Servers had nice personality and were on their A game. I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It came with home fries and fresh fruit. I thought the portion was perfect and it was just the right amount of food. Oh and the food was very nice. It's not quite the quality of Eggs Chesapeake in Buffalo, NY but not bad."}
{"text":"3.5/5  It was ok.   I got the huevos rancheros and side-bae got the easy as pie. The huevos were ok, but weren't easy to eat, and the Easy As Pie (EAP)... had lots of cheesy potatoes. There was a slight pause when the waitress had set down the EAP. It was basically soup de pomme de terre de beacoup de fromage. Pardon my French. We had to stop by the Loblaw's bathroom afterwards. HOWEVER, the complimentary mini blueberry muffins were sweet. Would maybe come back? There were some other dishes I was eyeing up on other tables that looked tastier."}
{"text":"Pretty enjoyable.  The patio has a nice ambience with lots of greenery and ample seating.  We had Caesars (drinks), which were quite substantial (albeit salty), and the mussels were surprisingly good... again, maybe a little salty on the white wine/garlic broth, and slightly small as far as meat portion in each one, but the overall plate allotment is large and it's definitely yummy."}
{"text":"The Hair of the Dog is my default brunch place; here are my reasons why: - I never have to wait more than two minutes for a table. - The restaurant is located in a beautiful, old building, featuring climbing ivy on its facade (in the summer), and tons of character (all year round). - The staff is incredibly nice; the waiters are lovely to converse with. - The Caesars are yummy.  - The food, while not extraordinary, is predictably good."}
{"text":"The interior is dim, subterranean, and the seating is a little tight, but the food is spot on and the service is friendly casual. A good gastropub spot on Church by Carlton. Note: a 17% service charge is included for parties of six or more."}
{"text":"Go for the atmosphere, not so much the food.  I was drawn by the name and exterior of the place.  Inside it feels red, but I can't remember if anything actually was red.  It's not the raunchy kind of red, but the cozy kind.  It feels like being in your best friend's parents' house - familiar and comfortable but you still have to keep your composure.  There's also a small patio where you can smoke, and it's nicely lit with candles and strings of lights.  The food was mediocre.  I had the southern fried chicken, which was a few notches above KFC and many notches below Fire on the East Side.  The group of us had about 5 mains and a few bottles of wine.  Nothing stood out, good or bad.  I would go back again if it's convenient."}
{"text":"Burger was dry,  fries were soggy,  calamari was over battered,  nachos were super oil and nachos aren't nacho chips but fried tortilla or pitas,  guacamole is store bought."}
{"text":"My family and I (Hubby and 5 year old son) went here on a Saturday evening looking to get out of the hustle and bustle of your typical downtown Toronto restaurants and since we are here for the Marathon for my hubby to run there are so many people in town, yes more than usual!  Looking from the outside of the place it looked really small and dark but we decided to give it a whirl. I was a little apprehensive since we had our 5 year old with us and it looked more like a small romantic place you would go with friends or a date but after being seated it was totally fine. The atmosphere is quaint and feels homey. We started off with an appetizer... Poutine. It was pretty good. My husband ordered the chicken penne and I ordered the fish and chips. Long story short. I didn't like my fish and chips however I am a very hard critic of fish and chips so honestly it was my own fault. I know I only like British Fish and chips so I'm not sure why I keep trying to order it from places who don't specialize in fish and chips! I'm sure it was fine for a normal person but for me fish and chips- I am pretty tough. The Chicken Penne was fine and ate that with my husband since I didn't like my dish. But overall I would definitely go back, I loved the place and our waiter was really nice even when he noticed I didn't like the fish and chips. The food is reasonably priced. I will give them another try next time!"}
{"text":"Beware: Rant digression about brunch impending.   First a caveat: brunch is awesome, and to deny that would be disingenuous, unless you either hate eggs or work a night shift (and even in both those cases, brunch can still appeal). It's a meal you can eat anytime between 10am and 2pm on a weekend, and it usually involves deliciously boozy drinks working in conjunction with coffee. There's almost always home fries.   Now the rant...brunch is crazy easy to make yourself. It's not a secret. Anyone who's made an omelet, fried potato cubes, sliced fruit, and mixed 3 parts clamtomato juice with 1 parts vodka knows that you can have sweet eats, even for a large party of friends or family, in less than 30 minutes in the comfort of your own house. So when I go out to a restaurant where professionals are making the food for me, I have expectations of something better than what I can accomplish, as a non-professional. Certainly for 15-20 bucks per Eggs Benny/Huevos Rancheros (in this city, that's about standard cost.) There's lots of places in this city that make original and interesting brunches (Lola's par example) so I know my expectations are rational.  As my rant pertains to Hair of the Dog, I'm loathe to give it a lower-than-average score because 1) the food was tasty and 2) the service was exceptional, and 3) the prices were reasonable at around $10-12 a dish. Our server Jesse [sp?] was so chilled-out that he provided copious air-conditioning for our outdoor patio table. Not too bothersome, but always there when we needed a coffee refill or to provide a smile and an update on whether things were awesome (note: they were always). Definitely top notch service.  So while I hate to quibble, I must tie back into to my rant above by saying that the food was good...but also, not really anything I couldn't accomplish with what I usually have in my fridge, either. The vegetable frittata ($10) was a well shaped egg circle covered with cheese and filled with what I presume were tiny bits of potato. It was OK. The home fries were  delicious, but scant. The fruit was sliced. Perhaps I'm being unfair based on one menu item. I will add that the Caesar was delightful, and I happily recommend. I'd say perhaps stick to the Bennys or maybe have a look at the lunch menu. Make sure to ask for Jesse."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my boyfriend and his friend. This place is two floors and have a very big patio area, which would be great for summer time. Inside, the space was small. The prices on their menu is reasonable. The food quality is average.  The servers were all very nice and friendly. Overall, I would say this place is good to go to."}
{"text":"I feel absolutely terrible saying all of this, but my experience truly was a one star experience. I am visiting from California and tried this based on the reviews. We ordered burgers with poutine as well as beers. The beers were bottled, and were of course what was expected, which is good. The burgers were burgers, nothing more. The buns were very good, clearly from a local bakery. The poutine was extremely soggy and had been left in the kitchen for a while. One of the burgers came without the salad ordered, and when sent back for the salad, it took a while to come out. We were never offered water, and when asked for it, we had to ask another waiter as ours was taking shots at the bar. After the shots, our waiter never did return to us. The jalapeños on my burger made me very thirsty, but we were unable to get the attention of the other waiters even though we were one of the only tables in there. We are very nice people, and I feel bad that I still tipped well. My opinion is that maybe this place is going through a slump in terms of morale or staffing. This was the final straw with my tipping habits. I have just been across the entire continent and have noticed that very few wait staff have a good work ethic, especially in Canada. I will be tipping accordingly going forward in life. We were unable to verbally or with hand gestures signal staff for a check and I had to approach the bar. Most staff seemed out of it."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! The huevos ranchero was perfect with a \"hair of the dog\" beer! The waiters were friendly. Loved this spot!"}
{"text":"Came with a few friends with a reservation on Friday night! Two of my friends were super late and our lovely server (David! You're the best!) let us hang onto the table until they arrived. Food and drinks and atmosphere were great. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic steak and eggs. Very tasty and well prepared.   Service was tops, and the price was right.   Oh, and the beer was great!"}
{"text":"The Caesars are great, but Martini Mondays on their fabulous patio are even better. I mean, they have awesome names like \"So Good It's Got to Be Gay,\" which is almost as fun to say as it is to drink (it's like boozy Tang!). The food is pretty decent, too. Not the greatest, but reasonably priced and served with a smile. I love this place."}
{"text":"You must have a caesar.  That's what this place is for.  Glorious, enormous, delicious caesars.  Good place to bring friends or a date.  Music is not too loud either, particularly upstairs."}
{"text":"Delightful brunch option for the area. We took TTC here and it was very easy to find. T and I like to frequent the non-touristy spots of any city that we visit, and Toronto was no exception. Service can be a little off, but I appreciated the casual atmosphere. There's no airs of snobbery here.   We didn't get to try their signature bloody mary because quite frankly, we didn't know it existed! I realized that they had a signature drink after I ordered a plain bloody mary. It would've been nice to know of our drink options prior to ordering.   T had an Indian twist on poutine with chicken curry and cheese curds. It was really quite lovely, with just a hint of spice. Perfect for brunch. I had eggs benny and it was slightly overcooked, but still enjoyable.  I highly recommend Hair of the Dog if you want to get a taste of what the locals love around the area."}
{"text":"Very very good for dinner as well! Friendly staff, great service and food. The candle lit upstairs is a great place to sit to chat/be on a date. We had the butter chicken grilled cheese and the black bean burrito. Both fantastic and well-priced ($12)"}
{"text":"The cocktails were DELICIOUS!! Very cute place. The service was awesome. We took the fried chicken back to the hotel and it was so good. Can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, nothing to applaud at. Service can be better and Cutlery and glasses can be cleaner too."}
{"text":"Great place, very clean for a pub. Average prices. Their fish and chips is really good and I'm very picky about my fish and chips. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 4/10 Drink: n/a Service: 3/10 Value: 6/10 Hygiene: 5/10 Aesthetics: 3/10  I had a pretty poor experience here, it could've been that it was new years day and we had a relatively large group, but the service and the food quality was pretty horrendous.  I ordered the butter chicken grilled cheese and my friends ordered the crab cakes benedict, the butter chicken poutine, and the regular eggs benedict. The taste of the food was bland and lacked any outstanding flavour, the cheese in my grilled cheese tasted like cheese string mixed with kraft singles. The crab cakes eggs benedict was ordered soft and came cooked like a hard-boiled egg. The fruit was overripe and looked spoiled. They also served unpeeled kiwis with the skin on rolling around contaminating the rest of the dish with the little hairs. For the cost of the food here, it definitely lacked value.  Being an English pub, the decor was dingy and dark. The seats don't match and the place is covered in cobwebs.   The service here was curt and they would run off before you could ask them for a fork. Between sitting down and getting our food it took almost 2 hours. Many tables were seated after us but served before.   While my experience, could have been due to a few reasons, it left a pretty bad taste. I don't think I will be coming back here in the near future."}
{"text":"I've tried crab cake benedicts at other brunch places, mainly in Markham but this place has the best crab cakes I've tried. Their other food items that we've tried, chicken & waffles and huevos rancheros, are also delicious. I also couldn't stop eating the side potatoes, they were so crispy and just how I like it.   After ordering our food and before the food arrived, we got complimentary mini muffins which I believe were carrot muffins. Those were delicious and I'm glad they came before the food that we ordered because I was so hungry.  Their patio is nicely decorated with vibe leaves all around, and I would recommend their patio over sitting inside. The feel I got walking through the inside of the restaurant was tight, dark and stuffy."}
{"text":"I really like Hair of the Dog. I went here with my boyfriend and our good friends for an early lunch. I ordered the breakfast poutine ($12. Poached egg, hollandaise sauce, cheese curds, fries, and your choice of pulled pork or butter chicken). My boyfriend ordered a burger with goat cheese and sweet potato fries. Our friends: the breakfast sandwich and a steak burger.  We sat on the patio. It was really nice. That's definitely what I found attractive about this place. You just don't have these kinds of patios in Brampton. Everything's plastic. I liked our metal tables and the cool vibe and look of the place.  They have a bunch of different draft beers including fruili (which I love) and delirium. They also had this awesome mix called \"Fruilium\", it was fantastic. I ordered a glass of hair of the dog lager and really liked it. I didn't see an option for pitchers so I ended up just getting another glass. It was about $6 for 16 oz. Also, part of the proceeds when you buy the hair of the dog lager go to helping animals! So sweet.  The food can only be described as a flavour journey. In fact, that's exactly what I said at first bite. I opted for the butter chicken breakfast poutine (which was more like a shredded chicken).  It was kind of watery at the bottom but still very good. I loved the sweet potato fries my boyfriend had, and the spicy mayo had a nice kick.  Everyone enjoyed their food and our server was amazing. My friend's breakfast sandwich came out later than the rest of our meals and our server apologized profusely and gave her a free beer.  They also had thin slices of banana bread with icing sugar on the table. So nice!  I really like this place. Definitely for a drink and I'm eager to try it again for dinner food on their menu!"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to check this place out, since I heard some good reviews. I came here for my birthday with a large group of friends and we were seated at the large table by the door. The overall environment was nice, casual, a little rustic, and friendly.    I ordered the lamb stew as my main entree. It was interesting as it came with a salad and bread. I enjoyed it quite a bit as it was very full of flavour, very tender meat, and just enough of the lamb taste. Sadly, Everyone's main was just ok or they didn't enjoy it. I had a bite of my friend's pull pork sandwich and it was dry. However, the something that did blow our taste buds was the Nachos and Ceasers cocktail. Definitely one of the best versions I have ever had. I would recommend coming here for a late drink or a quick get together before going to another restaurant.  I hear good things about their bunch. I will definitely come back again to try it out and hopefully change my view."}
{"text":"Good price and customer service. Its a cozy restaurant with a good selection of food and drinks. I ordered the country style chicken, and i have to say it was delicious. They have a cranberry orange drink that was also really good, tasted even better with vodka.  The waiter was personable and funny. I found him to be more entertaining then the people i was with, hence the vodka drinks.  The restaurant has two levels, with the bar being located on the first floor and washroom on the second. I liked the fact they have a vegetarian option on the menu, and a good offering of deserts."}
{"text":"Nice patio, nice bathrooms, good service, okay food..  Ordered the nachos ($13) with added guac ($2) and ground beef ($4).  Other reviewers said it was greasy - I think that might be just because there's so much cheese - if you love cheesy nachos, these are for you, and the portion size is generous, but yeah that cheese can be a little much.  A little on the pricey side too ($19 with the adders that are normally standard other places).  On the plus side, the chips were a nice crispy-soft thicker variety rather than just something from a bag, so that was redeeming, and the toppings were plentiful, with sour cream & salsa provided as well.  I should've taken a pic in retrospect..  Also tried the fried chicken with mashed potatoes, gravy, and cornbread.  The cornbread and gravy were nice and flavourful, though the mashed potatoes were a touch on the over-soft side, and the chicken was somewhat dried out / overcooked, and way too over-crisped/battered.  If I'm being honest, it was a bit disappointing.  Will be back to try some other dishes, I really want to like this place more!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a few friends after seeing the positive yelp reviews and the location can't be beat. We sat at the patio, which was really nice and huge!  I thought that the food was pretty good, but very standard pub food. I had the butter chicken grilled cheese, which I thought was the best dish of the night. The portion was huge. I only ate half of my plate and was full. The tuna melt and chicken sandwich were okay. Portions were also huge and tastes fine, but are dishes that you can find at any pub.  My only one complaint was that I felt that the wait staff were not very friendly. It took a while to get served and the waiter just kind of dumped the food onto the table, almost spilling my fries, and left without a word. It also took a while to get water and our bill.  I might come back and try brunch since it's literally 5 minutes away and the patio is nice, but food and service is pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"In Toronto for a little fun as well as some work.  My  boyfriend and I were staying at the nearby Courtyard Marriott and the girl at the front desk recommended this place.  We arrived and I immediately noticed the lovely patio and knew that's where we needed to sit.  It was 11:15 on a Sunday and busy, but a great spot for 2 by the fountain was available and we took it.  I ordered the butter chicken grill cheese and my boyfriend the breakfast poutine with butter chicken.  Both were very good and very sizeable portions.  We enjoyed watching passersby, chatting, and just \"being.\"  Our waitress was very friendly and although they were busy she didn't seem to rush us.  I would definitely eat at this place again if given the option!"}
{"text":"Never again. I was there last night with a party of six. An 18 % tip was automatically added to our individual bills. A little presumptuous, but fine. The kick in the teeth was rudely being asked to leave less than a few minutes after paying to fill other tables, while patrons who had been sitting there much longer were left alone."}
{"text":"As expected, I've returned to this place with a friend after having a seriously crazy-obsessive bloody ceaser craving! This time I've had crab cake benny - and oh my gosh, was it ever delicious!   Service was spot on, as usual.  Keep doing what you're doing guys!"}
{"text":"I was incredibly surprised by the yummy food.. Pub food tends to be touch and go..   The crab ravioli was really, really good! They serve a pretty healthy portion.  The bartender was adorable and makes a mean cocktail.   Thanks Andy P for the recommendation.."}
{"text":"A group of my friends and I were looking for a place to grab a drink while we were waiting for a table at a nearby restaurant. We saw Hair of the Dog and were a little skeptical at first glance of the exterior, but we were happy with our choice once we went inside.   From the outside, Hair of the Dog looks a bit dark and run down, but the interior has a cozy and intimate feel and is slightly reminiscent of an English pub. We arrived around 6:15 and the lower level was about half full (there is also an upper level which I did not visit). We were seated by a waitress and greeted promptly by our server. They have an extensive beer and wine / cocktail menu. We did not look at their food menu as we were only having drinks, but the food that I saw passing our table all look really good, and I would be happy to return to try some of their dishes.  Our server was very pleasant and more than happy to provide drink recommendations and split our bills for us. I also enjoyed the slogan on the back of the servers' shirts: \"Come, sit, stay\" - a nice little play on words on dog commands.  This was a good find and a place I would return to for a drink or to try some of their dishes."}
{"text":"This is my favourite little place! Great atmosphere, the staff is fantastic, and they have a cute little patio for the summer months.  Drinks: BEST CAESAR EVER. Also their cucumber martini is awesome.  Food: They have a great brunch, though I mourn the loss of the smoked salmon benny. Good place for lunch or dinner, I've had everything and it's all good."}
{"text":"Went recently with friends from out of town. Plus... Natchos were great... I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken. Came with mashed potatoes and gravy, and steamed veggies. Chicken was over cooked and greasy. Gave me indigestion to the point where I couldn't sleep. Each experience here is hit and miss. My fav here is the jambalaya. Didn't have it this time out, but one of the other diners did and that said it was good. Advice... Stick with the safe dishes."}
{"text":"Totally different experience this time.  Grabbed a seat on the patio - I see why everyone loves this HUGE patio.  There's a little bit for everyone.  Couples who want to have a nice dinner, groups who want a wild night out, or a few friend who just want to have a couple of drinks over appetizers.    I came for the romantic dinner.  I started with the rose sangria.  I love all things rose and all things sangria.  It was delicious.  My bf got the house beer.  He wasn't a fan, but there were so many drinks options so he just switched it up.  We split the potato skins to start.  Aka the potato chip nachos.  Need I say more?   He got the steak sandwich for dinner.  He wasn't that happy with it b/c the flank steak was a bit dry but the fries were good.  I had the fried chicken on recommendation of our server.  I was very happy with it.  Deliciously crispy, well spiced, homemade batter with a juicy chicken inside.  The jalapeño cornbread was awesome - I wish I had more.  Buttery, velvety mashed potatoes and fresh veggies on the side.  Our server was great as well.  A bit slow, but it was a busy Friday night.  All in all, I am so glad I gave this place a second chance b/c I have been won over for sure!"}
{"text":"This is one place I should have reviewed long ago! There are only a few places in the Village that has a more upscale feel than pub.  It's not quite like the pub atmosphere you'll find at the usual standards of O'Gradys or the Churchmouse and Firkin.    This place is where I go to for what I believe to be the best fried chicken. I've had in the city - so far. Southern Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes, gravy, veggies and cornbread. The cornbread is amazing! I've had this dish so many times and each time it has been consistent.  I've not had a bad meal here whether it be an appetizer or another entree. Solid grub.  I haven't tried it but my friends swear if the chicken isn't available to go for the butter chicken sandwich.  There are 2 floors plus a beautiful patio if you can get in it in the summer. It's one of my faves. It's covered with greenery and kinda secluded.   The only thing is sometimes they get so busy the customer service can be a weee bit off. Plus if you are a beer person I've found that most beer aficionados have a hard time finding really good beer here."}
{"text":"I'm new to town and love coming here for lunch when I can. The food is great and they pride themselves on a few house specialities which are standard fare but a cut above the rest or with a unique angle. The drought beer selection is outstanding and worth coming for alone.   You'll love the staff who are genuine and make this place a real stand out. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"An amazing bar for drinks and just to hangout. It's my go to bar when I'm in the area. Their Caesar is one of their best drinks, always with generous amounts of pickles. They've got a great list of craft beers and the staff is always so friendly. Would recommend over and over again."}
{"text":"Best nachos in the city, Hands down  Christopher- thanks for the awesome experience and for the pen!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and would consider it my local. Food is great, drinks are amazing and diverse and the staff is the best, EVER! (I have a little crush on David....shhh, don't tell anyone. K?!)  In the summer, you seriously can't beat the amazing patio. Like a hidden little oasis of everyone and anyone! Nothing better than an early afternoon brunch and a pint in the summer. Vibe is always awesome and staff make your stay worthwhile.   Oh, and the Caesars are to die for! Like, seriously! ;)  No, really.....you need to at least visit once. It really is the Church/Wellesley corridor's little gem."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite go to restaurant in the Church street area. Nice selection of beer, wine and pub food. I've never been disappointed by anything I've ever ordered.   The nachos are a much purchase! They make their own nacho chips in house and they are delicious. Myself and a friend had an order tonight and they were enough (with chicken and guacamole) to completely stuff the two of us leaving behind 10-20%.  Nice atmosphere, rarely make reservations or have to wait for a table. Always on my list of options!"}
{"text":"I have been intrigued by this place for a while.  I am a fan of a brewery in Portland by the same name. So when visiting the area I decided to finally try this place. It is not related to Hair of the Dog in Portland. However they do serve Flying Monkey which is pretty good. Little back patio which is a great spot for brunch. Had a breakfast poutine which was alright. Gravy was on the thin side, cheese curds were alright but poached eggs and curry chicken ... can a guy really complain. I was done with the day before it started after eating all that, but damn did it hit the spot."}
{"text":"Best little out of the way patio in the summer, cute and romantic. Love their selection of beers and it's a nice get away from the craziness of the village... While still being in the village :)"}
{"text":"I like atmosphere. Food is tasty. I wished little bit more ( like potatoes) in my dishes because I'm big eater. Overall is good!"}
{"text":"One of the best bars I've been to here in Toronto (and i've been to a few too many)  This place has a great variety of beers at a good price. Like honestly, you can't really go to a \"nice\" bar and get a not-too overpriced beer.  I'm a big fan of La Fin Du Monde and here you can get it for just 7 bucks! Yay!   Now, the nachos... THE NACHOS. These nachos are by far THE best. The tortilla chips are homemade and everything is just great.  Now, last Saturday they sat us on the west end of the patio and it seemed like it was infested by flies and ants. That's my only complaint. But hey, I get to drink and eat on a patio, what do I expect right?   Awesome bar. Probably one of my faves."}
{"text":"My trip to HOD was terrible. I waited forever on an omelette. When I got it, they messed up my order. I asked for a salad to replace the home fries but got the fries instead. When the hostess started loudly rolling silver ware next to me (I was sitting at the bar), I just got my food wrapped and left. The only bright spot was a very nice bartender/server."}
{"text":"Went to hair of the dog for an early dinner. Justine, our sever, was great. The pub is client oriented and I had a great overall experience. The fact the they have Delirius Tremens on tap made me go in and I did not regret it. I had the steak frittes and to was wonderful. Definitely recommend the place."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this place! Came for a family brunch and waited 45 minutes for our food, that came out bland and cold. When asking the wait staff for some more sauce for the dry butter chicken grilled cheese we were met with confusion and were told they hadn't had any other complaints so they didn't know what to tell us. No one offered any kind of solution. We also heard the staff talking crap about us complaining, so that's always nice.   My mother also fell up the hidden step to the bathroom and the near by staff said nothing to her. Not very helpful all around!"}
{"text":"It's really sad that I have to further downgrade Hair of the Dog after my third dinner here.  It turns out that dinner 1, which was pretty good, was a fluke.    Visit #2 saw me sending back the most charred, disgustingly burned burger I've encountered in my life.  Visit #3 saw me again sending back the burger.  Here's a hint.  Do NOT under any circumstances order the burger.  The other issue was that out of my group of 8, a few people ordered about 15 minutes later.  After waiting for exactly 90 minutes after placing their order, their food was still not there.  The waiter \"had no means of communicating with the kitchen\" to see where the food was, so they opted to cancel their food, pay for their drinks, and leave to go eat at McDonald's.    This restaurant needs to step up its management both in the kitchen and the front of the house, because it's a disaster right now.  The pretty patio is nice in the summer, but I'd stick with just drinking, and avoid the burger like you'd avoid Ebola."}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying I haven't eaten here yet...but I have had many many martinis.  and god are they delicious! my bf and i tried the ride 'em cowboy, the 'breathless', got to be gay, and twisted apple. they were all scrumpticious and cheap on mondays! we sat on the patio which is cute and fairly secluded from the street, very cosy! the service was phenonmenal, especially for a pub. i'll def being going back soon, as it's right around the corner from my place.  **EDIT** nom nom nom. had the smoky chicken penne with gouda and sundried tomato cream sauce and it was quite yummy."}
{"text":"Hair of the Dog is a fun place with a nice patio that is perfect for a warm weather weekend brunch. They also have a nice-looking bar inside.  I ate here for brunch. Service was pretty good (server got confused about the order some, but was otherwise great), and breakfast was standard, but well-done and delivered to the table in a timely manner. I had the huevos rancheros, which were tasty.  The sangria was excellent.  The only warm-weather challenge are the bees/yellow jackets on the patio. We had them swarming around our table the entire time.  If you can escape the bees, Hair of the Dog is definitely a fun, relaxed place to meet friends for brunch."}
{"text":"Having brunch in the patio here feels almost like branching in a secret garden! Such beautiful patio space, surrounded by beautiful plants and leaves. Almost magical! My girlfriend and I came here early Sunday morning to avoid the crowd and was able to secure the seat by a cute little fountain; oh-so-perfect for Instagram stories ;)  Now onto the good stuff - the food. We first were greeted by 2 free mini muffins that were delish! Between the two of us, we had the crabcake benedict and the huevos rancheros. The crabcake benedict was really great, except that my poached eggs were set to hard, and not medium as I requested. However, the server was very kind and offered to have them redone. I decided not to considering how much I enjoyed the crabcake - I was in a good mood! The crabcake was served as a substitute to the English muffin and was very generous in the portion! They also tasted amazing with lots of crab meat.  The hollandaise sauce was also really great, flavorful and neither too thick nor too watery.   The huevos rancheros was also really great! Loved the burst of flavor that came with every bite.   Service here was also wonderful and all smiles all around. Loved it and will definitely be coming back to this gem!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I had the fish and chips there and it was so good.  One of my friends had the baked fish, I had a bite and it was probably one of the best things I've ever tasted!  The staff are hilarious and just great to be around.  We even were able to see Carol Pope sing from where we were sitting.  It really was as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing.  We had Sat brunch here.  The banana bread French toast and crab cake Benedict are outstanding.  A very complete wine and beer list as well.  If I visit Toronto again in the future, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto with friends & looking for notable brunches in the city. This place was delicious! The food arrived fast, service was really nice & patient with my group, and the outdoor seating area was perfect for such a lovely day. Everyone ordered a different omelette (mine being the French omelette) but all thoroughly enjoyed their meal. I would definitely come back again next time I'm around & looking for a nicer experience."}
{"text":"Best patio. Really. This is a cool, hip place that you will enjoy.  We popped in more for food than for beverages of an alcoholic nature. We tried:  a) our first poutine which was rather unhealthily yumm.   b) The crabcakes which are good too - just the right amount of spice and crab.   c) The salmon which was a smaller portion than expected but cooked well  d) The mac and cheese which was appreciated by other members of the party  The service was prompt and efficient and overall a very pleasant night out. I recommend this."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday with some friends and we all loved it. We arrived around noon and there was no wait for a table for 4. The menu had plenty of options. I had:  Easy as Pie Scalloped potatoes, cheddar cheese, peameal bacon, onions, peppers, two eggs - poached or scrambled, hollandaise sauce, toast  I had the Hollandaise sauce on the side, which was fine because there was enough cheese on the dish already it didn't really need the sauce. Two of us had this dis hand both of us were really happy with it. It was unique, fresh, and filling. I would recommend this place for brunch"}
{"text":"We loved this cozy bar tucked away near our hotel.  Come down a few steps into a dusky bar with great ambience and local feel.  We tried the ceasar salad and pierogies.  The salad was very good and fresh, the pierogies were good but not crispy enough for us.  Granted, husband is Polish and the family gets together to make several dozen.... so we are biased.    We shared some drinks and had a great conversation with the table next to us- we were in Toronto just after the US Presidential election and of course it makes for interesting times.  Our waiter was just the right amount of attentive, keeping the drinks coming and checking on us but not too much.  We would have loved to come back and eat there again, but it was our last night in Toronto.  We will definitely stop in the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"This is an atmospheric pub with an extensive selection of draft and bottled beers, wine, and more. Somewhat eclectic pub fare: I had the butter chicken grilled cheese, which was a caloric concoction of joy. Accompanied by a very nice kale Caesar salad, it made for a lovely meal. I chose a locally brewed cider as a lovely complement to this meal.  I think one of the ways to truly judge a restaurant is by the quality of its coleslaw. This is a deceptively simple dish: it's easy to make, but it's also easy to make badly. Hair of the Dog had one of the best coleslaws I've had in a long time.  I ate outside, and the garden dining is lovely. The interior is somewhat dark and not quite so inviting, But the food well makes up for it."}
{"text":"Monday Night Martini specials! 3 oz. martinis for $6.50, oh, why, thank you! I am a fan. With drinks named \"So Good It's Got To Be Gay\", \"Frothy Shot to the Tonsils\", and \"Ride 'Em Cowboy\", you better come ready for a good, yummy time for your taste buds.   I came with a martinis in mind, and did not divert. I enjoyed the \"So Good It's Got To Be Gay\" (best of the night!), \"Tropic Thunder\" (I love Blue Curacao), and the Razzmatazz (tasted so sweet I forgot there was alky in it). I also ordered their spicy mac 'n cheese to temper the 3 oz. bursts of inebriated fun, and it was delish.  The group I was with sat indoors, right under the staircase. It must've been custom made to fit the funky corner of the room, but it was the perfect size for our 10+ group. They also offer bar and patio seating.  Service was pretty good at the beginning, but it seemed like they were trying to cut us off when all the waters rolled out and they stopped taking drink orders... dude! we're shelling out good money for drinks. That was a little frustrating, but I suppose it keeps you coming back for more. What a tease! Hahaha... whatever, I'm totally coming back for a \"Hot Tranny Mess\"."}
{"text":"My local haunt, HOD makes for an easy default when my friends and I are looking to grab a drink.  Situated in a lovable old house on the butt-end (ha?) of the Gaybourhood, HOD effuses a welcoming vibe with dim lights, fun music, and a buzzing crowd.   A huge draw during the warmer months, HOD's patio is one of the best on the strip, offering plenty o' space and shade. I find there's a higher frequency of smokers than on some other patios however, so beware...or smoke 'em if you've got 'em. This patio is a drastic and welcome contrast to the overly crowded O'Gradys patio up the strip; you won't find angry bear-waiters here demanding to know where your party is, and the food and drink selection is superior.  Renowned for its burgers, it's hard to go wrong when you use a cheese bun as a base. They do charge extra for toppings which at some places are gratis, but the price is reasonable. The fries here are top-notch. Since I'm usually here for drinks I won't comment much on entrees, but the potato skins are always well-received. Note: the nachos use home-made deep-fried chips, which I find way too heavy. They're a meal onto themselves.  The beer selection is one the best things about HOD. Pilsner Urquell, Sapporo, Blanche de Chambly and Mill St. Stout (optioned in to replace Guinness) are on my constant rotation. The HOD Caesar gets a lot of love, and it is indeed, one of the best Caesars in the city (ask for an extra pickle when you order it). I'm not one for cocktails, but they've a large selection to choose from.  Wait, why am I selling this place so much? Please don't come here when I'm looking for a spot on the patio. I hear O'Gradys is pretty good..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch! HUGE beer selection. The veggie burger was amazing and can be customized to your taste. The party was juicy and flavorful unlike most veggie burgers. Loved the outdoor seating. Wait staff was friendly and quick. If you're a vegetarian and love to drink.... this is the place to go to!"}
{"text":"Good variety on menu. Ate upstairs and it was pleasant and not noisy.  Arrived close to 6 PM on a Saturday and by seven they were turning away people at the door - it was packed. Good service and food was above average for a pub."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place about a million times and always wanted to try it, so glad I finally did. Good food and great beer at reasonable prices, friendly service, nice atmosphere... what more do you need?  They have Delirium Tremens on tap, which alone is a good reason to pay this place a visit. I had the tuna melt with a side salad - very tasty, and the salad was literally the biggest side salad I've ever seen. My friend had the butter chicken grilled cheese; she said it was really good, and judging from other reviews this seems to be their specialty. My boyfriend had the fish and chips; he said it was decent but I tried a couple bites and it was definitely better than decent.  I was a little disappointed that they had run out of the Mort Subite Kriek, one of my favourite beers and pretty difficult to find, especially on tap. I guess that just gives me a reason to go back - along with their patio in the summertime. I'll have to come back to try their brunch as well."}
{"text":"Overall I've always enjoyed my time here. I go a few times a year & have never had a bad experience.  The service has always been good. Some servers friendly then others but never rude or unprofessional.   The drinks are what keeps me coming back. They have very unique drinks. My favourite is the glee. Have 2 of those & you're half way under the table. Prices are pretty standard for a nicer place I find. I've never eaten here but I hear the food is good.   The atmosphere is perfect for a date. Dark, romantic, on the classier side. The outside patio is awesome in the summer."}
{"text":"Great food, very polite staff! Will definitely go there again. Tried Benedict on Crab Cake and loved it."}
{"text":"Nice patio and excellent service. I went there for brunch, the food is good but plate wasn't big enough for the big stomach I have. Prices are correct though"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were looking for a late night dinner date/snack on a tuesday night 9pm and decided to go somewhere nearby and it was her birthday tonight.   This cozy little restaurant bar didnt look like much outside but inside felt just like home. My girlfriend and I ordered a total of 4 things, a baked potato chip poutine dish, two alcoholic drinks and a nice rich chocolate dessert. Total was around $35 bucks.   I have to say that the quality of the food dish was top notch. I'm not a fan of cheese but I think tonight, I might have changed my mind. The baked potato poutine dish came in very hot and the potatoes were nice and crispy covered with cheese, bacon, tomato and other garnishes. The best part was the amount of cold sour cream on the side to balance the temperature heat. 10/10 for this dish. Great size for 2 to share!  The chocolate dessert was also very good quality as well. It came in a dish with a nice slab of rich very pure and heavy chocolate. It was accompanied with two perfectly balanced biscuits which tasted perfect with the slab of yummy rich chocolate. The portion for this was perfect for the two of us as well.   I have to say that the service from this place was top notch. I used to be a waiter and I don't think I could have done as good as a job as the gentleman that served me tonight. He took his time to explain the dishes to us and was very accommodating and had a lot of positive energy coming out of him. If I could, I would give him 6 stars for his work. Keep up the good work!  This is a great place to go for a date and comfortable conversation. I would definitely be back again soon since my girlfriend seemed to really like this place as well."}
{"text":"On my business trip to Toronto, people have been telling me to eat here. At first, you think it'll be an ordinary pub with standard pub food but then you enter and realize how wrong you were. First, it's well decorated. It looks like a pub but it has modern finishings. The beer selection is out of this world. Sure they have the non adventurous beers, but they have a ton of beers that are off the beaten path. Beers that you've never heard of, but that's ok!  Now, the food. It's fresh and delicious. I had the burger and green salad. The burger is juicy, the bun is well toasted. I asked for havarti cheese and bacon to be added. I don't think I needed to add these because they were slightly overpowering but the meat itself was great."}
{"text":"It is a bit overrated.   Service is great and the menu is varied and quality.  Staff are professional, ambiance is pleasant - if it is quiet here than it is quiet everywhere.   Great for brunch."}
{"text":"Ordered huevos rancheros and eggs florentine. Decent place for quick brunch. Loved the service"}
{"text":"Pro: The music is calm and soothing.   Con: The patrons are neither.  The scene: we go for brunch at smith and then meander down to the Hair of the Dog pub for a post-brunch glass of wine.   In a clumsy moment of what was clearly a drunken stupor at 3 pm, one of the patrons knocked over a bar stool. My dining companion and I, startled by the noise look over to see what happened. Upon gazing at the disaster before us, we were publicly and quite loudly lambasted by the perp for \"rolling our eyes at her\" - long story short, after several attempts to halt the screeching accusations  and reassure the said drunken patron, she made a public display to showcase her 'taking the higher road' by singing Let It Go at the top of her lungs as if we were the ones to create the spectacle. This being said, apparently every patron who frequents this joint is in various levels of delusion and/ or denial.   After witnessing our trauma we were then notified by the server that this aggressive disaster of a woman and her motley crew of degenerates are apparently regulars.. after sussing out the place, can't say I'm shocked.  He offered us a free bottle of wine which was never delivered nor did he comp the first one in lieu.  Apparently if you want good service here you should throw bar chairs and start fights with the patrons?  Lol.   Trust me, unless you are a 45 year old woman with rage issues who is fond of day drinking & not spending time with your kids, Avoid."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Amazing alcohol selection and prices. Wide variety of beers, they also make amazing caesars. Brunch or dinner, Hair is a must visit!"}
{"text":"Staff and atmosphere make this place. David and Corey can light up any room.   The food is rightly priced for the quality. Definitely not high end but above many restaurants in the village and beyond.  Definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Today I had a Sunday brunch in hair of the dog. The decorations were so cute and the dining experience was great. I had the egg Benedict with coffee as my order. The server was patient and the food was fresh and delicious. We will definitely come back another time. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was OK. Had the tuna melt - I could have made it in 2 minutes myself at home... seemed a bit greasy, too. Also, I took my parents here and my poor father (from a small town) witnessed 2 guys having sex in the bathroom... :/"}
{"text":"Ok.  Went here last night and loved it.  The drinks were delicious and food was great.  But what made this a truly great experience was the service.  The patio was beautiful and packed...perfect for pre-club hang out.  Overall an excellent experience."}
{"text":"This place deserves the \"totally awesome\" badge.   There's no word to describe their martinis - and the names are super, like \"So Good It's Got To Be Gay\". You HAVE to go there on Monday to drown on their martini menu! BUT I'm a traitor. I believe their absolute best is the Caesar, definitely the best I've had in Toronto so far.  The food is also delicious, well served, and I'm still in love with my waiter two weeks after. Unforgettable experience. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Butter chicken grilled cheese!!!!  Let me repeat... Butter chicken + grilled cheese.  Same sandwich.  Awesome!  So juicy tender chicken and cheesy gooeyness in a perfectly toasty sandwich.  Yum yum.  Fries were crunchy and flavorful too.    They have a cool patio area for outdoor seating and really nice staff.  Unique items on the menu for pretty reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. We waited at the bar for our group - it was a bit of a tight fit, but the bartender was adorable, and he made me the best darn martini I've ever had. Five of us went upstairs for dinner. I had the hummus plate - it was gargantuan! The array for tomatoes, peppers and cucumber were fresh and crispy and perfect.  Hubby had the nachos (also completely massive) and enjoyed them - half corn and half flour tortillas, unique. The order war was won by my friend's mom who enjoyed the most beautiful piece of salmon I've ever seen.  The service was solid.  It was seriously loud and had a lot of trouble hearing each other, so I wouldn't recommend it for a group but it would be lovely experience with just two or three people seated closely."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast after an early morning flight on a recommendation.  We had to wait in a line outside before being seated.  Some woman was having a hissy fit with the door guy.  So I wasn't sure if we should eat here.  When we finally went in, the whole dining room was empty and everyone was on the patio, and we were sat in the corner of the dining room.  It was a little funny since we were the only ones in there.  We ordered mules which were good.  I ordered the eggs benedict which came with home fries and a cup of fruit.  The hollandaise was good but it would've been nice if the home fries were made with onions and/or bellpeppers to give them a little character, since they took up most of the plate.  I'm sure this place is great for some, but I was a little underwhelmed since it has a catchy name.  Perhaps the evenings are much more interesting.  The staff was all very nice and the space is interesting."}
{"text":"Too many bees always to revolve around the food & us and the bread became moldy, the waiter is friendly but he just change another bread(seems same....)"}
{"text":"Great little pub! If you're craving \"comfort\" food, aka a giant plate of nachos or a huge burger, this place is definitely a good spot. My coworkers and I ventured out in the snow since Hair of the Dog was only a block away from our hotel. Our waiter was super friendly and funny, and the food/drinks came out pretty quickly. Great craft beer selection too!"}
{"text":"Perogies was good! It was a bit oily but the onions and garnishes that came with it was yummy. Servers were nice and the ambience was also great to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"First night in Toronto and, with a few hours to kill before a concert, the bf and I dropped into Hair of the Dog.  So glad we did!  We had our first \"Caesar,\" and their version of it was 20oz of goodness in a glass--large portion, double shots, and all the fixin's (fresh cucumber, pickle, tomato, and olive). Note, there's a $1 charge to change to cucumber vodka, red wine, or tequila.    We also ordered the butter (curry) chicken grilled cheese. O-M-G, so bad for you, yet so so good.  Seemingly an unlikely combination of flavors, the spice from the chicken combined with the fresh, grilled challah bread created an extremely tasty combination."}
{"text":"This place is solid. I've been a couple times. There's a good beer selection (imports and Ontario microbrews), the food is decent (had the steak sandwich last time and the steak was surprisingly tender and the sandwich very flavourful; it had caramelized onions and peppers and cheese and spicy mayo and the bun to meat ratio was not too large), and the patio is nice and quiet, even when full of people. (Maybe it's a kind of place that inspires calm conversations?) It seems slightly overpriced, but I'm okay with that.  We were expecting six people for a meeting and were told there were no tables large enough to accommodate us on the patio, so be warned: it's not a place to go if you're in a large group and want to sit outside. The patio is much more charming than the inside of the pub. There were a few large tables inside, fyi."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best nachos I have ever had in my life. Not even joking. They seem to be house baked, and the flavours are just so intense and rich. I almost want to say it is a surprisingly juicy snack, but that would do it a disservice - you just have to try it.  Otherwise, the place is really cute. They have space upstairs and downstairs with a nice back patio in the summer. They have brunch during the work week as well, which makes it stand out a bit from most places. Other than the nachos I have only tried the butter chicken grilled toast sandwich, which definitely was not what I had expected. Left me underwhelmed, but the nachos were well worth the trip.  They also got a decent selection of beers, but much better selection of wines if you are a wine lover.  Overall, definitely a good place to go to - maybe a date even. The patio is great in the summer, and the atmosphere is pretty relaxed. And, of course, once more: best friggin' nachos in the city!!"}
{"text":"had brunch here and was disappointed that I wasn't able to order the butter chicken grilled cheese.   Ordered the eggs Benedict, the eggs were really over cooked and the hollandaise had way too much citrus in it. The service was horrible, considering we got here right when it opened I was shocked by how slow the service is.   Will not go back"}
{"text":"So we came here for my friend's birthday. We went up to the patio which was quite nice; good table arrangements with a nice view. This is however was where the nice experience ended. After our initial drink order (which our waiter was not happy that it would be separate billing) it was like literally moving a mountain to get anything supplementary. You would think that a bar would be trying to sell booze but when the waiter comes around every half hour and you actually have to flag him down to take an order, you realize that your presence must be a nuisance. After a while of playing coy, our waiter just told us that it was not worthwhile for him to service us (funny considering he was never actually there to take an order) and that we all had to close our our cheques and someone else would come instead. Closing out the cheque meant a mandatory 20% tip for poor service. Then apparently one of our friends had gone to the literal roof top (with others) which meant we were now kicked out... Even though we did nothing wrong....And had to leave without actually finishing our drinks. Props to this bar for having access to the roof that customers could easily take and then punishing everyone else in the party for it.  This bar clearly does not want / need your business. Sorry but if I could give a negative tip for this inattentive service I would to offset the 20%!!!! tip they have given themselves for not taking orders and then complaining that it was not worthwhile to climb one flight of stairs to \"deal\" with us. This sets a great example for other bars; be crappy, but in a good location ; that way customers will come regardless of how you treat them. Don't let this craphole get away with it; don't give them the chance by just not coming here."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place and recognized the name from a previous search on Yelp!  The restaurant is 2 floors.  The inside is kind of narrow and long like a rectangle.  I did notice a very large seating area outside.  They have a bar - maybe 6 or 8 seats.  The menu is quite simple and uncomplicated comfort food.  Perhaps, too simple.  I ordered the poutine and a local IPA.  Are half and drank half.  Seems like a nice, safe, simple place to eat.   If you want a decent beer, this place is OK.  I would not consider this a main destination for food."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday during our weekend trip to Toronto from Buffalo. We were a little weary because locals said it wasn't too great, but I'm so glad we went! The Caesar was to die for. It almost tasted like there was pickle brine in it! The food was great as well, we ordered the easy as pie and the flavors in it meshed very well. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"\"Meh\" pretty much sums it up.  Drab food. Drab decor. Drab waiters. Drab smiles.  OK, maybe \"drab\" sums it up better.  That and the cold food that's supposed to be hot and the vermouth-drenched martini that's supposed to be \"extra-dry\"!"}
{"text":"Finally was able to get a table at this restaurant. Very popular restaurant, great set up. I loved how intimate it felt with a neighbourhood/local feel.  I had the special of the day, Chicken Pot Pie. It was average. The server was attentive and checked up on us often.  I gave Hair of the Dog a 4star, based on the service, atmosphere & excellent drink selection. Although the food was average, I will return."}
{"text":"I live quite close to Hair of the Dog, and would often pass it by with the intention of going cus it looked dapper. Well after living down the street from it for a year I finally went, and wow is it yummy!  One word: Brunch One other word: Caesars Yet another word: Eggs benny   Those are three pretty great words, and Hair of the Dog did em up right! Slightly more pricey? Sure. Worth it? Very."}
{"text":"Great dive bar layed back vibe. Super friendly and funny bartender who can stir up one hell of a dark and stormy.. So good I came back for more the very next day"}
{"text":"Good service, good selection and variety of drinks. Food is reasonably price, but you get what you pay for... My friend got the garden burger with fries and the most flavor out of the entire meal was the goat cheese. I got for myself a poutine and pirogies. Pirogies were on a bed of oil and the poutine was almost like a soup of gravy!"}
{"text":"love this place. the beer selection is awsome. price is good. food is good. cozy little place for dates, or go with friends or anything. try it!"}
{"text":"Brunch review:  My friend and I arrived at the restaurant at noon, and we were escorted to the 2nd floor. The space was bright, and filled with patrons. I can only imagine how busy they must get over the summer (they have an amazing patio).  OUR ORDER:  The Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich: fried egg, tomato, crispy bacon, cheddar & swiss cheese, on toast, garnished with pesto mayo & dijon, home fries (I substituted the home fries for sweet potato for an extra $2). $11+2=13 Chicken curry breakfast poutine (it is not on their online menu): Chicken curry with fries topped by a poached egg and hollandaise sauce. $13 Hair of the Dog Caesar $8.50 Sangria $8 (one made with rosé and one with red wine) French toast $11 So how was it?  The Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich  The Good  I was ecstatic to learn that they used Challah for the sandwich. I absolutely LOVE challah bread because it is soft, thick and sweet I loved the saltiness of the bacon The fries were perfectly crispy on the outside and pillowy soft in the inside You could taste every ingredient, though every bite was different, which I like (e.g., one bite was all bacon, and the other was tomato--it kept it interesting) The portion was great  The Not So Good  The sandwich lost its shape because there were too many wet elements The ingredients lost their texture (tomato, bacon and became soft) Lacking in texture contrast  Overall: The sandwich was delicious, don't get me wrong. But I think that next time I will ask to omit the tomato (I realized that I am not a fan of soft wet tomato), and get the mayo on the side, rather than in the sandwich (oh, believe me, I will be dipping my sandwich into that delicious mayo!)  Chicken Curry Breakfast Poutine  The Good  Egg was perfectly poached The fries were crispy and golden with just the right amount of seasoning Cheese curds were squeaky (if you love the real deal you will know that the cheese in a poutine should be \"squeaky\") The curry was light and did not overpower the other ingredients  The Not So Good  The curry should have been thicker. Because it was runny, the fries ended up absorbing a lot of it, and they lost their texture Because the curry was runny, the hollandaise got lost and you could not taste it (the two blended together) The portion was different from what other patrons received. We were thrown off when the person next to us ordered the same item, and theirs was filled till the top of the bowl (almost overflowing), and my friend's was not. My friend was still happy with her portion, but it just felt odd to see. Overall: My friend cleared her plate and did not share! If the curry had been thicker, I think it would have made the dish close to perfect.  French Toast  My friend and I loved the French toast. In fact, I knew better than to let my friend free range at it--I was getting my share dammit! The only thing that I did not understand was why the bread was so thin, when I knew for a fact that it was challah bread. What happened? Well, apparently the bread was deep-fried and this resulted in the bread losing air and well, having the \"pancake\" look. Mmm, I do wonder what the result would have been if the bread was not tampered with? And by tampered, I mean deep fried.  What about the drinks?  Reviewers were not kidding. The drinks at Hair of the Dog are amazing! I am not a cocktail drinker by any means, and limit drinking them at events, but I would not be able to visit Hair of the Dog and not get a cocktail. They really know their shit.  Full review here: http://wp.me/p2mHMr-14J"}
{"text":"Absolutely lovely service here, which is important to me. They look like they love their job. The food is high quality pub food. I don't go often because I'm into fine dining but when hanging out with my pub-going friends, this is the only pub I can think of off the top of my head that I'd actually go to."}
{"text":"Love it here! If you are in the neighbourhood and want to order food with your drinks then this is the place to go. Great menu and everything was delicious! We all ordered different dinners and everyone was happy.  The servers are really friendly and attentive (except for one guy) and overall the experience is excellent."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is so popular. I visited Hair of the Dog for a weekend brunch when it was not too crowded. Their service was okay, the ambiance of the place is so-so, food was just average. I also couldn't understand why Caesar cocktail the best in Toronto. Meh. If i'm nearby, I could go there, but I won't be making a trip to go to Hair of the Dog."}
{"text":"I went for drinks with bunch of friends. We end up ordering nachos and perogies. The nachos were pretty good, they are not your regular corn nachos you get at most places. These one were wheat and they were made to perfection. The perogies were delicious, I would definitely recommend them. The service was not the best but I have to give it to them, it was right after pride so I give them the benefits of the doubt this time and let say they were exhausted."}
{"text":"Good cozy breakfast in this restaurant. Great service, super friendly and nice. Inexpensive and satisfying. Good looking place in the Toronto Village. 2 floor restaurants with a Terrace"}
{"text":"I came here for a work brunch and ordered their ultimate breakfast sandwich with a side of fries ($12).   While it was  delicious, the bread was slightly burnt which made it difficult to eat. I ended up scraping off the top layer of bread, which made it much more enjoyable. Had they used soft bread, it would have been slightly healthier and much more tasty! The fries were good, not overly stiff, which I quite enjoyed.   The patio was stunning! It brought back memories of the secret garden, my favourite childhood movie.  Overall it's a beautiful spot with decent comfort food at an affordable price. I'd be open to going back, but likely wouldn't crave their food..."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and it was FINALLY nice enough to enjoy it on the patio :) Great place for the summer with a nice ambience. Their fries are amazing as well!"}
{"text":"We walked in for Brunch on the weekend and it was by far, the best meal I had in Toronto. We were immediately seated and given menus. However, I knew immediately that I was getting the Crab Cake Benedict and that was the best decision I made that day. The crab cake was thick so they didn't serve the Benedict atop an English Muffin or biscuit or anything. Yes, that's how big the crab cake was. I didn't even miss the bread and that's saying a lot because I loves me some bread. Oh, and it was soooo flavorful. Just thinking about this makes me want a crab cake right now, but, no, I'm sitting at work writing this Yelp review. The potatoes they served alongside the dish were outstanding. Perfectly cooked with the perfect amount of flavor. Not too salty, but just enough salt. Not too crunchy, but a slight crisp to them.  I ordered a Caesar and this just might be the best Caesar in town. Also, it was reasonably priced and I appreciated that because I was not trying to pay $15 for a cocktail that day. My bf ordered the peameal bacon benedict and he said he loved it. I didn't try it because I was deep into my crab cake benny.  The service was outstanding. It seemed like the staff enjoyed being there and made sure your experience was enjoyable as well."}
{"text":"This is a small two floor restaurant with great ambiance. My friend and I went for brunch on a Sunday, we arrived shortly before 11am and the place had a few people. Once we ordered and got our food, the place was full. You get little complimentary muffins when you are seated. I got the crab cake Benedict, the crab cakes were great but everything else left something to be desired for. The service was stellar, despite being a two floor restaurant."}
{"text":"If you're sitting on the patio, this place is just fine for afternoon drinks and some pub food. In fact they are located at a pretty quiet intersection which makes the patio 'extra-awesome'.  But in terms of a restaurant experience on the inside, it falls a tad short.    There's nothing wrong with this place, but it is a pub with average food."}
{"text":"HotDog (as I'm now calling it) has a good mix of the three things I look for in a restaurant: good service, good food, and all of this must be reasonably priced. Sunday brunch was delicious here though there were some things that could be better.   I had the Huevos Rancheros which were so yummy and served with baked beans, small portion of fruit and a small salad composed of spring mix type lettuce. I love the unique way HotDog serves up their huevos rancheros, the crisp tortilla holds up pretty well considering the soggy toppings.   My SO had the Florentine Benedict which had large mushrooms on it and is served with potatoes, salad and fruit. He said the hollandaise was good, but we both noticed how disproportional the two eggs were to each other - one was seriously tiny while the other was normal looking.  I think the service deserves a huge mention. The little extras always make meals memorable, we got a small complimentary plate of banana bread at the beginning of our meal which was delicious. The servers are wonderful at their job, really nice and fast. Also sincerely apologetic if they mess up (happened to another guest, not us). Our server was also fast on the coffee refills, +1 awesome points for you.  With a great selection of beer on tap and tasty looking desserts I didn't get to try this time, I will definitely be back. Love the area, love the service, love the food. Love HotDog!"}
{"text":"Nice patios on street level and second floor. I quite like the food here. Butter chicken grilled cheese sandwiches are amazing. Service is attentive and the servers work hard. Located opposite the north side of the old Maple Leaf gardens/Loblaws, it is quite convenient and quite on the patio."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I came here for lunch on Friday; a majority of us voted on coming here.  This was the second worst vote of the week; the worst was the night before, when Ontario decided who is going to be the new Premier.    The service was horrific.  While we were a group of 20, we did call a few days ahead to make a reservation.  We were seated on the patio which was being serviced by just one waitress.  Our food arrived to the table extremely late and staggarad - some people didn't receive their meal until at least 20 minutes after other parts of the group.    Orders were also sent to the table incorrectly - main dishes were paired with the wrong sides, and food that was not ordered was being brought to the table.    The waitress had a very poor excuse for the disappointing service and under staffing.  She said that a lot of the staff were on vacation.  What kind of manager would allow a large number if their staff to have the same day off???    The food was ok, but did not look like the photos on their website.  The gravy I ordered tasted sour - no thank you!    The only positive thing I can say about this restaurant is they had a great looking patio, with lots of greenery and decorative water falls.    The poor service cannot be forgiven.  Our lunch hour turned into almost 3 because of the slow service.  I would be completely understanding if 20 of us spontaneously showed up for lunch, but we had a reservation so there was no reason for one waitress to be inundated."}
{"text":"I enjoy the vibe in this neighbourhood pub. I have visited during the summer, and I love the little patio outside. There is a lot of greenery, and some shade on a hot Toronto day. A few nights ago, I visited with a girlfriend. The inside is pretty dank, but at least there are some candles on the tables to create some atmosphere. I previously tried the house made nachos ($16), and they didn't quite live up to the hype. The flour chips had an interesting texture, but they charged extra when I asked for more salsa. It was a huge plate of nachos, with a tiny salsa ramekin. Definitely not enough salsa, especially for salsa lovers! When I visited with my friend, I had the grilled chicken sandwich ($16) with bacon. The sandwich was less than mediocre - overcooked chicken, dry bun, mushy tomatoes that were clearly put in the fridge (when they shouldn't be). I will say that the fries are excellent. I believe they are house cut. The food and drinks are quite reasonably priced, and it's a decent neighbourhood pub. I will definitely come back for drinks, maybe some fries, but will probably skip the other food. I will also say that the service is underwhelming. Our server wasn't friendly at all, and barely stopped by the table."}
{"text":"Food was excellent ,4 of us ordered different dishes and there were definetly no complaints food was delicious , service was terrific - highly recommended"}
{"text":"A long-time favorite of mine. Charming & authentic nook just south of the hustle and bustle of Church. Not a gay bar but not, not a gay bar either.   A friend took a group of us here when I was just a boy. I was really impressed by the diversity of offerings across the board. Some really neat and rare finds.   Specials are excellent. Service is phenomenal. Decor is cultivating. You cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"This place is slowly becoming my favourite neighbourhood bar. I love the coziness of this place, and their nachos! They have a decent selection of various beers, and the service is alright. Our server had to come back to us a few times to ask what we wanted for drinks and food again, but either than that he was attentive enough.  I'll probably go back next week to try a new beer and a new dish."}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto, my boyfriend and I stopped here for Sunday brunch. It was a beautiful day, so we were drawn here due to the outdoor seating.   The outside was the perfect setting for a cool summer day. There was so much shade and beautiful greenery with cute little water fountains. We sat here for a bit enjoying mimosas before our food came and it was very enjoyable.   My boyfriend got the easy as pie and really enjoyed it. He said it was the perfect portion of food. I ordered the crab cake eggs Benedict. There wasn't very much crab, or it was imitation crab, but something was a little off for me.   Overall, we would come back for sure. We enjoyed the outdoor ambiance so much and the food was good brunch food."}
{"text":"Cute little place right by the flagship Loblaws. I chose this spot having mentally bookmarked it ages ago, and finally grabbed some good company to go with. The inside is dark, quaint, and they've got cutlery and serving trays as their decor.  First, ordered a 3oz martini called I Want Your Sex ($9.50). I took explicit pleasure in ordering in a normal voice, and minimal giggling. And I figured, 3 oz?! Yeah, buddayyy, I'll take that!  We got nachos for the table, and it was amazing!! With chorizo ordered on the side, the nachos were especially yummy because they used pita chips rather than normal nacho chips. Hefty amounts of cheese and olives made for a good time.  For main, I eased off and ordered the Chicken Pate ($8) which came in an adorable glass jar, tons of crostinis and certainly enough to fill up my belly. The pate was creamy and delicious too! My BF ordered the curry poutine ($9), which was good sized portion and heavy on the curry, so if that's what you're after....all good!   All in all, great value for the food, and no complaints about the service or food at all. Will be a repeat event for sure."}
{"text":"Ok, drove downtown, paid $12 parking, waited 35 mins for a table waiting in the cold vestibule to try the famous Nachos everyone raves about.     While they looked appealing and the 1st bite was interesting, they very quickly went from good to bad.   They seem to be deep fried, then loaded with toppings and baked...or burned.  They were super greasy and sat in our stomach like a brick!    Thankfully we also ordered the Burger w Fries which were excellent!  Nice size burger and the fries were crispy and lightly seasoned.          The ambiance is nice, friendly servers and low lighting made up for the worst Nachos ever."}
{"text":"This place is sketchy....I don't understand why it has high ratings  My friend and I tried the Fish and Chips and it's so sauggy, too much flour on the fish and the fries were salty.  Environment: Old, Dim, feels dirty  Service: slow, I have got better services before.  nothing much to talk about this place. won't go again in conclusion"}
{"text":"This was my second time here for brunch and I thought my first experience over a year ago was positive so I returned. Arrived for brunch and received a table outside. Complimentary mini carrot cinnamon muffins were served which was a nice touch. Once I received my food, I got flashbacks that, no actually, last time wasn't great and why am I back?  I ordered the chicken and waffles, a special just for brunch on the weekends and we also had the butter chicken grilled cheese from the regular menu. Either the waffle was bigger than at other restaurants or the chicken was the smallest I've ever had on waffles, but I think the latter was true. The chicken was extremely dry and overdone. The dish came with fruit and the pineapple was pretty much at the end of its life. The butter chicken grilled cheese was delicious and very different, but they mixed up the order and gave us regular fries instead of home fries. However, thumbs up for an original twist to butter chicken. I was so hungry I ate half of the Grilled cheese on top of my chicken and waffles. Don't think I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and it's always 3 star worthy. The beer selection is small and the food is just so-so. The best thing about this place is definitely their patio. It's large, clean, and has a rooftop extension. Service is decent but if you order food, expect a minimum 30-45 min wait."}
{"text":"Not fantastic, just A-OK, I'd say.   A couple of friends and I came here on New Year's Day for a nice brunch. On first impression, the place seemed cool. Nice atmosphere, seemed a little intimate, we were greeted quickly and seated almost immediately.   Between us, we ordered a combination of things: poached, scrambled and fried eggs. I can't remember the names of the dishes because they weren't very standard. Overall, the food was good but it wasn't out of this world. In terms of the meal itself, it was just above average - nothing to get me raving about the place.   The average price of the food was $12-$15.When you combine service, speed and food, the overall experience was pretty good, so 3 stars."}
{"text":"The servers at this place are either desperate for patrons or need a refresher crash course in Smart Serve. I can't even begin to describe the motley crew of degenerates in this place. There was an old lady who was drunk as a skunk, slumped over in the corner talking to herself. There was another drunk lady who I'll call \"Mary Poppins\" who inserted herself into my conversation with a friend to berate us for saying some children aren't grateful. She became enraged at the mere mention of us referring to specific family members who she does not know, so to keep in mind that these are our opinions. Luckily she packed up in a huff and took herself and flower hat elsewhere.  Now for the two disasters seated at the bar (how appropriate) - two more intoxicated females who had no business drinking another drop. One got up and knocked over a chair, and upon looking over at the noise, my friend and I were screeched at for supposedly rolling our eyes. Fingers pointed and causing a scene, the lady was very angry that we dared to avert our eyes over to her chaotic messy antics. Needless to say that killed the vibe. We told our server we felt uncomfortable and may leave. He told us these customers were regulars (shocking) and harmless. He offered to comp our bottle of wine....but then didn't.   We left and went across the street away from the scorn and pointed fingers of drunk women. Never again."}
{"text":"I went here after a fun night out. I was initially drawn here because, frankly, hair of the dog is exactly what we needed.   The atmosphere is very cool, almost like an old house. We sat at the lower level across form The bar and we're greeted instantly. The drinks were good and strong without being overpowering or too sweet.   I had a basic eggs, toast and bacon breakfast. The other meal was huevos rancheros, which looked amazing!   My only complaint is that some of the waitstaff gathered close to our bar table and gossiped a little bit about this and that. It was not very professional to be talking in front of a restaurant full of patrons. All in all, I recommend!!"}
{"text":"Not bad - pretty decent food, decent drink selection and good service. Worth a shot!"}
{"text":"Patio! Patio! Patio!!  Just like the patio at Hair of The Dog!   Having a drink here waiting for my friend to arrive is such a treat! Shady? Sunny? Rooftop? Pick whatever you like!   Services here is top notch! Friendly staffs which made me feel comfortable and right at home.  I wish I have a patio like that at home!"}
{"text":"Solid choice with super great Service and good food.  Went around noon on a weekday so some of the table and brunch while others had more lunch options like burgers.  Crab cake Benny was amazing..All the things you want in a crab cake, not too much filler, no weird added flavours and the crab comes through.  Been here for dinner too and it's a great spot when the patio is an option."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place but wasn't impressed at all. Unprofessional, annoying staff and mediocre food"}
{"text":"We came here for some brunch at lunchtime. We ordered the pub breakfast and the butter chicken sandwich. The butter chicken sandwich was pretty good. The pub breakfast on the other hand was a very standard extra-greasy breakfast. You can eat indoors or in the patio, which is shaded and pretty large. Overall, the food in general wasn't anything special although the butter chicken sandwich was good. Nothing outstanding though. The service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I've had some good times at the Hair Of The Dog.  I've also spent some quality time *recovering* from good times at the Hair Of The Dog.  You see?  This spot can suit just about any occasion.  This is pub-ish, but I hesitate to commit that to text because, well...it's more than that.  It's slick, and quirky, and goes above-and-beyond with both interesting menu items (food and drink) and service.    I've always had great service here, masterfully towing the line between attentive and not-too.  During the daytime it's relaxed; at night it's busier, as music plays and tables fill with dates and hungry Torontonians (I usually fall into the latter category).  A few special notes: - their boozy selection is great, with special brunch-y shout-outs going to the Caesars - the tuna melt is fantastic - (watch these caps) THE NACHOS ARE A MUST-HAVE.  Made with flour tortillas instead of the traditional corn, these are like no nachos I've ever had before.  Some like to \"share\" this, but when it comes to these nachos I don't know what that word means #nachohoarder  Yelp note: if walking down Church Street from north to south it's easy to forget that the Hair Of The Dog has an amazing patio on its south side.  Double points from me with my Baltic-white skin for its shade.  Snag a spot here and it's the beginning of a great afternoon."}
{"text":"Magical spot in the Village. The food (brunch, lunch, dinner) is great, the service is even better, and the drink selection is top drawer. They have an eclectic assortment of martinis and mixed drinks with names like \"My Little Pony\" and \"Hot Tranny Mess.\" For my money though nothing beats the H.O.D. Bloody Caesar. It's massive, mouth-watering, perfectly spicy, and served with a delicious pickle. (God, I want one now.) In the summer, their shaded patio is a brilliant spot to sit. Truly one of my favourites.  Obligatory Title Pun: This DOG has bite.  Menu Readability: I have it memorized, so I can't remember.  Need to mention: Where's the men's washroom? Upstairs, behind the black curtain.  What this place teaches me about myself: I love Caesars. Is it my superiority complex?"}
{"text":"Quand je suis arrivée à Toronto il y a quelques semaines, c'était l'heure de souper mais je ne  voulais rien de trop compliqué. Quand les gens chez qui on restait (airbnb) nous on dit qu'à quelques pas de l'appartement il y avait un endroit qui faisait des grilled-cheeses au poulet au beurre, j'étais vendue. Il était très bon, mais je le décrierai plutôt comme un grilled-cheese au poulet curry. Le Bloody Caesar était de toute évidence une de leur spécialité donc c'est ce que j'ai demandé et je n'ai pas été déçue : rafraichissant, épicé et plein de saveur. La liste de bière en fût est aussi pas mal bonne avec plusieurs bières de micro brasseries Ontariennes. Demandez à être assis sur la terrasse en haut pour être dans un beau petit recoin plus intime que la grande terrasse de l'étage principal."}
{"text":"came here last night. it was alright overall, really great patio though. had the caesar it was ok as well, nothing outstanding.  the service was slow, our waitress was grumpy and waited a long time for our orders to be  taken, for water etc. the host was friendly and quite appraochable though. their Visa machine is shody and so we had to go inside after 2 attempts on the patio. the food (i got the special pasta) was a small serving and just ok. the other ravioli dish was well liked by other ppl at the table. the menu was enxtensive and prices were quite reasonable. i would come back here for the patio in the summer, awesome place for a beer."}
{"text":"The food there was terrific and so were the drinks!. Service was friendly and attentive. Server was always around when you needed but gave you space to enjoy your dinner and sit for as long as you want. Can't say enough good things about this place. Portions were generous and atmosphere was relaxed."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each time only ever ordered drinks.  I decided to order nachos this time and I have to say I am so incredibly disappointed.  The chips (which were pita chips) were burnt and the cheese wasn't even melted.  Even the green onion wasn't chopped properly (it was still intact).  We asked for extra sour cream twice and never got it.  Very disappointed.  The server was pleasant enough but inattentive.  Not sure I would want to give it a second try for food."}
{"text":"Stopped early afternoon for quick drink and appetizer. All good. If you want something more than beer or wine. Come here. On my trip i had found only a few places in Canada that make a really good cocktail. This place does a great job.  Recommend the elder flower martini. Pleased so much came back for dinner. Ordered the martini of course and went with grilled chicken sandwich. Cooked just right, not dried out. I'd give the place 5 stars but service was a little slow. Doesn't appear it's from lack of effort as I saw all employees constantly moving about serving."}
{"text":"Hair of the Dog is my favourite restaurant in the village, and the occasional wait for a table is testament to that.  An excellent and broad menu in the style of a gastro-pub, Hair of the Dog serves up delicious treats like jambalaya, spaghetti and meatballs (a favourite), a decent hamburger, and on the weekends one of the best brunches in the city. Everything comes served by friendly staff who can make an excellent Caesar or pour you a good, cold beer (ask which taps are better though - sometimes the Sleeman Honey Brown comes out flat - my only gripe.)  Lots of good ambiance with velvet curtains, pictures of dogs (wearing hair - natch) and candles. Hair of the Dog is a great go to place as well as a date option - especially if you want to run into friends so they can evaluate your date from a distance or save you from date hell."}
{"text":"This place was amazing five years ago, I don't know what happened. The food now tastes awful- the hollandaise sauce on the eggs benedict was really sour, the eggs had a strange texture and the portion of homefries was tiny. My girlfriend ordered a scalloped potato dish that made her nauseous. It was super oily and looked like it came from a hospital cafeteria. The service is also extremely slow. We were literally the first to arrive when the restaurant was empty, and somehow the last to be brought our food after all the people who arrived after us were served.  I tried going back a couple times to give Hair of the Dog another chance, especially because my experience a few years ago was so good, they have a beautiful patio and it's literally right across the street from my apartment. But it's just so terrible."}
{"text":"Estive por duas vezes la muito bem atendido e a comida deliciosa. Cardápio variado com otimas opcoes."}
{"text":"Hair of the Dog...a venue I had walked past literally hundreds of times but never stepped foot into, until a brunch with friends this past Sunday!  I must say, I was quite pleased and only wish I had given the pub a chance sooner!  LOCATION - Hair of the Dog is right at the foot of the Church Wellesley village, just after the intersection of Church and Carlton. If you are heading down the \"strip\" it's easy to miss since there are a number of other options you'll run into first.   AMBIANCE - I had somehow never noticed, but the patio here is BIG! There is plenty of shade and a lovely small fountain. A very nice outdoor brunch experience.   SERVICE - Although our waiter was friendly and attentive without being too obtrusive, there was nothing especially memorable about our service. I do also realize the restaurant was likely quite busy around noon on a Sunday. Overall I was satisfied with the level of service provided.   FOOD - While waiting for our meals the waiter brought out some banana bread, which was quite good. My pulled pork Eggs Benedict was also very enjoyable, as were the side of homefries.   PRICE/VALUE - I believe my brunch was $14 before taxes and tip, right on par with any of the other dining options in the neighbourhood.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try out a new place for dinner and loved this place. Everything is made in house with quality ingredients. Lots of vegetarian options! Their nachos are made fresh. I had their mac and cheese and my husband had the indian dish. We enjoyed our meals. Also they had a big selection of drinks, including local beer and cider. The service was excellent. And lastly it was not too loud in there. Music was good but low and we were able to have a conversation.  Great vibe in there of people just relaxing and having a good time."}
{"text":"I went cause of the great reviews. I was really underwhelmed. I went once for brunch and had the corned beef hash. It was not good. Bland, didn't taste good and the look and texture of the dish was rather off putting. I went for dinner another time, had the fried chicken. It was ok. The food came out 5 mins after I ordered so I question the freshness."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I stopped in here twice now and both times have been great. The staff is friendly and attentive, the food is good and the drinks were great. She highly recommends the Sunburn cocktail. It is a bit on the pricey side but still a great little spot."}
{"text":"No...not hairy dog, it's hair of the dog. A great find in the city. A good place to start off for a drink. I actually used to walk close to this place all the time and didn't know about this pub. I really wish we had found this earlier it is just a great place for a drink or a meal.  Rare patio weather when we went which made it all the better. The service was great very nice people"}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a drink, their Dark and Stormy cocktail is on point! Our server was great, and liked the laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing food, and such a cute clean place! It may be small, but such a friendly environment! In love and much come back."}
