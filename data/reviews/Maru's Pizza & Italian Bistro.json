{"text":"Stumbled across Maru's menu and could not have been more satisfied with the elite customer service, speed of delivery and ultimately the DELICIOUS food that arrived! Maru's has a detailed and well written menu and is soon offering a gluten free option for their pie. I ordered Maru's White Pizza which has fresh ingredients and a nice solid crust to support it. I went on a whim and ordered a chicken empanada and regret not ordering the dozen, I was making \"yumm\" sounds and all. As a finale the Tiramisu was the best to date. Definitely keeping Maru's in my contacts, thank you for a great experience and meal!!  Z"}
{"text":"Nothing good about this place to be honest. The pizza sauce is a bit sweet which gives the pizza an odd taste. I ordered garlic knots and found them to be covered in raw garlic and butter. The dough is good but it's definitely not enough to keep me coming back here.  Also, the delivery man didn't have a pen...    First and last time I'll be ordering from here."}
{"text":"After leaving our review, the owner reached out with a very thoughtful message. She did not ask me in any way to alter our review. I really appreciate this kind of service. She even offered to feed us on the house. Judging from all of the great reviews ours was probably an exception in any case. If we eat there again, I'll make sure to update my listing."}
{"text":"I must say, this business has excellent customer service. They sent out a new batch of food that was good. Much better then the first batch. Everything we just tried was delicious this time. Maybe I was too harsh the first time. I will continue ordering from them in the future."}
{"text":"I ordered the vegan meatballs and bread pudding for dessert. Delivery was on time - that's a plus. The meatballs were accompanied by a few of the cheaper \"seasonal\" veggies. The bottom of the plate wasn't even covered. $10.95 for that? Not reasonable at all. Making money fast - that's all I can say. The bread pudding - I have my serious doubts it was made at the restaurant. It looked and tasted like a food service item. Overall - the price compared to what you get... I won't order again. There are better places in town."}
{"text":"Great slice. Awesome chicken parm. Pasta made in house! Top it all off with great service and you know your at marus. I will be frequenting this place you should too."}
{"text":"Today I ordered delivery here based on yelp reviews. I was scrolling through the pages and the pictures of food caught my eye they looked kind of homemade in a way. So I ordered a 10\" pizza with olives and no sauce which they actually cared not to put sauce and a cannoli. The pizza was good it was just a normal pizza I liked it, the cannoli was okay but not the best I ever had. I mean it was $20 well spent because I was hungry and craving pizza but I could get a large pizza like that for $5 lol but nonetheless great timing on delivery and probably will try other menu items from here soon. Thanks !"}
{"text":"Ordered online through Eat 24. Ordering was quick and easy. Unfortunately after an hour and a half I still had not received my food. I then attempted to chat with Eat 24. Chat person rudely told me that orders take 45-60 minutes. Instead of pointing out the obvious ,that it has been well over an hour, I attempted to chat with another person who could just answer where my food was at. I finally got an answer and was told it was on the way and I could expect it in 10 -15 minutes. The driver was finally able to make it and I have to say employees like himself are the reason that places stay in business. Food was hot , delicious and fresh. The driver was sincerely apologetic and apparently the restaurant had a driver walk out on them. After a short conversation, the driver I spoke to completely changed my negative impression of my first time experience with this restaurant. Employees like him should be commended. I only wish I had thought to get his name. I hope the owner reads this and gives him the recognition he deserves. I will be ordering again (next time directly) from this restaurant because of his awesome customer service. BTW food was well worth the wait. :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Everything homemade and you can't beat the prices. Food comes in a timely manner and the staff is friendly. Have had several items off the menu and each was as good as the last. Working close is an added bonus! Have been to this place several times and look forward to future visits! Would give more then five stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Came by this place on Yelp it only has two ratings but we wanted some place close and this sound good and we are sooooo happy we found this place!!  They scratch make their sauces, dough and pasta in house!!  I had Fusilli al Pesto ($8.95) it was amazing lots of creamy pesto sauce all over these fresh made pasta noodles mmmmm! My hubby and son both had two slices of cheese pizza and a soda ($7) the slices were huge! Then my husband couldn't resist and ordered a stromboli supreme! The veggies in there were very fresh I could see them slicing up the veggies in back and the meats were very good there was pepperoni and ham. The stromboli was put together fresh that you could taste everything and it all went very well together! This place is fairly new only been open for about 3 months the staff is very friendly our server Guitano ( sorry if spelled wrong) was awesome once he found out my Hubby's family comes from Sicily like him he talked with our son about the different places there and showed him on a map where he was from, he was great very nice! So far can't say anything bad about this place. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"First visit here and had our mind set on pizza, ended up trying the beef and a cheese/onion empanadas they come with this chimichurri sauce that we loved, the chunks of garlic-dear lord! I need a jar! Empanadas made to order and served hot.  The chicken piccata was great and it came with fresh pasta..we will have to come back to try the pizza."}
{"text":"First time here. Gaetano's service was A-1! The food was fresh and homemade. Found restaurant on yelp!  We were visited by two different men during our meal both very pleasant.  Very clean and nicely decorated. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not life changing and not awful.  We got the cheese bread and veggie pizza. The pizza was cooked well and the crust was not too doughy or too thin.  The cheese bread was nothing to write home about. Not a bad little place.  We called on and picked up.  No problems and the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"What a great place! My fianc√© and came here for lunch, service was excellent, I was able to talk with the manager, who let me know that everything was made in house! The pasta, pizza crust, all desserts, breads, all of it made in house and you can tell when you taste it! I will be back sooner than later!"}
{"text":"The menu is a bit pricey but the quality is fairly solid- didn't try their pizza, but $14 for a GF cheese pie special doesn't sound like a bargain to me. Their site is easy to navigate and online orderings are super simple.  Eggplant parm app, $9, 4 slices of breaded eggplant with a sprinkle of cheese and a cup of marinara to sauce yourself to the preferred level. Forgettable.   Empanadas; $2.10 each, don't ask me why an Italian joint has empanadas on the menu, just know that they're really good. The spinach initially caught my eye but the beef was way better- even taking into account that the cheese inside wasn't even melted. Whoops.  Garlic knots; $5, oiled and seasoned well but somehow a bit lackluster. Wonder if the dough is the same they use for pizza, seemed on the plain side.   $20 takeout order was fine but I'd only return for the empanadas or to give their pizza a try. They offer gluten free and sicilian, I just don't typically shell out the prices they're asking for takeout pizza- price is more on par for specialty or high end shops."}
{"text":"2nd visit and we were not disappointed one bit. I can honestly tell you this is the best Italian Food in Las Vegas! !"}
{"text":"Decided to go out for pizza with the family. I saw the reviews for this place and it was close by so decided to come in for dine in. The in-laws ordered a pepperoni. They enjoyed it. My husband and I like to think outside the box so ordered a chicken Alfredo pizza with added spinach. Absolutely amazing! The waitress was very tentative and even played with my baby. Will definitely order take out from here from now on as we don't go out often."}
{"text":"Maru's Bistro has the best pasta and garlic rolls we've ever had! The Penne Arrabbiata was spicy and flavorful. The Ziti al Forno was smooth, creamy and cheesy. The pasta on both dishes was cooked perfectly. The garlic knots were amazing! Everything was absolutely delicious and the service is great. We will definitely be back every time we visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a food craving that just took over?  Today was one of those days.  I wanted pasta and I wasn't going to stop until I got some.  As I was driving home I passed a car with the license plate \"Maru\" which reminded me of the YouTube celebrity kitty from Japan.  Then once home I began searching yelp trying to find my perfect Pasta fix. When I stumbled upon Maru's I thought it was a funny coincidence but the reviews of fresh pasta got me hooked, plus they offered a check in special.  So with lightening speed I hurried on over there with my boyfriend.   We were greeted immediately and the service was very attentive and friendly.  I changed my order after looking over the menu and it was handled with graciousness and charm. Finally decided on cannelloni stuffed with spinach and ricotta served with tomato sauce and my bf got the Quatro formaggio. Both were prepared fresh and tasted delicious. My cannelloni was like a cloud of yumminess. Perfect.  I'll definitely be going back to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Let's begin with this is a review for delivery, not dine in.   Us fat girls at work (shout out to my  sweethearts, Amanda and Nichelle) decided to try a new place. We had the menu dropped off and couldn't stop drooling over the options.   After picking over everything and deciding to share we ordered; chicken strips with fries, garlic bread, garlic knots, spinach salad, an extra order of fries and two chicken empanadas.  Pros; -garlic knots were delicious. Smothered in garlic and herbs, dripping in olive oil. - chicken strips were good not overly crunchy. Pretty nice sized. - empanadas were very good. Loved whatever was in them. Full of flavor.   Cons; - Fries were soggy. No salt to them.  - delivery took longer than expected. They said 30 minutes and it took them 40. Wouldn't have been such a big deal if it wouldn't have been for the meeting we were expecting to go to, so had limited time to eat. - they forgot our ranch and marinara and so they had to drive it over - ranch was not homemade. Tasted like hidden valley. I would know cause I hate the taste - marinara was okay. Very watery. It was eatable.   My boss ended up saving the spinach salad for herself at home. She said the next day it was tasty.  Overall for delivery I wouldn't come back. Next time I will go for dine in and try sandwiches, pasta and pizza."}
{"text":"Very good. New favorite restaurant tried different things from pizza to pastas. Definitely the best garlic knots. A must try   they have great service too."}
{"text":"My original spot for pizza is now closed on Tuesdays so I decided to yelp around for a new one. This wasn't the best pizza I've had. Something is missing about their pizza. I ordered the pepperoni and sausage pizza, very bland and just completely flavorless. For the price I was expecting more. I think I'll skip out on them next time."}
{"text":"Pizza and Pasta excellent like eating at Grandma's house. the server very good. very clean everything. I congratulate and thank you for what they do. see you soon. No more good food."}
{"text":"Conveniently located to where I'm at. Menu looks tastefully planned. On my first visit, I ordered the white fish special. Although I was called to return back to work immediately, I had to @least get a quick taste before asking for it to get wrapped up to go! I must say, that one taste gave me the craves to wanting to just  finish it! LOL The service was politely excellent and I assure you & them that i will be back when I EVER get the free time away from work! Oh, I have to also mention that I went there w/my son on national pizza day that day, and my son ordered 2slices of their pizza, well being that he is a pizza fanatic since childhood, he was pretty much satisfied. So if you're wanting that pizzaria pizza and some good wholesome pasta dishes, then I suggest that you come on down and check it yourself, because it's \"Mama Mia mmm mmm good!\" LOL Oh! And plenty of parking as well! Bravo smooches!"}
{"text":"Great food, helpful staff with lots of suggestions,  and great food!  They have lots of choices and great service.  Everything I've had tastes perfect.  If you like pizza and other Italian style treats stop by."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant...friendly service.  It's only been open 3 months now.  Good specials and portions....great Southern Italian flavor.  Lots of eggplant on the sandwich,  great flavors, fruits in the salad, sweet sauce on the pizza. Will definitely be back to support this small, tasty business."}
{"text":"I'm always looking around for some new Italian spots around town, and I can definitely say I'll be coming back to try some more things. I got linguine with their salsa rosa sauce (pink) and the pasta was definitely fresher than other places I've tried. I'm thinking they could be house made! The sauce could use a little bit more flavor, but regardless I stuffed myself to the max because I couldn't stop eating it! I also got their pepperoni and Marus house pizza. The ingredients tasted fresh, but it did taste a tad salty to me. I think this place is great and definitely deserves some more attention! I'll be back next time I get an Italian craving!"}
{"text":"Terrible. my husband and I ordered the chicken wings and pasta carbonara. chicken wings were dry, watery potatoes and pasta seemed to have only white cream, nothing tasted good. we order food for pick up at 2:25 pm and they were ready at 1:55 pm when we arrived and all had much time to be done and tasted bad. not return to this place. by the way the food made us feel sick and my son threw up a couple of hours later"}
{"text":"Fabulous service and food! We will be going back very soon! The Maru salad with Italian dressing was wonderful. We bought a 12\" pizza that was perfect with all organic ingredients!"}
{"text":"I've never been more torn about a review in my life. I ordered the Margherita pizza and it looked BEAUTIFUL! it's super fresh too, it's just....  It needs some seasoning it's kind of bland, also when you pick it up the toppings slide off the pizza. I bet it will taste perfect once I put it in the oven and eat it later. Which is kind of sad. I'll order one more time from here, the delivery guy was nice.  The $6 delivery charge is bogus though....."}
{"text":"Gentleman who helped us @ the counter was a sweetie pie. Spinach empanadas were very good. Beef empanadas were having an identity crisis. Unsure what was in it but could not eat! Yikes. Minestrone soup was good. Didn't have pizza but my kid scarfed down and she doesn't usually like pizza. It smelled delicious and looked decent which is rare here. I'll try again. It's close and my picky eater enjoys."}
{"text":"I tried this place out on my sister's recommendation and came for just some bolognese.   I'm not sure if it was just my perception but it seemed like the owners were a little snappy with one another. Perhaps, it was a long day.   Observation: they are right next door to Laser Tag and walking in I could hear some obnoxious and illiterate conversations outside, in front of the place. I can imagine that Maru's gets a lot of young and/or disrespectful... OK, let's say \"trashy\" people in, being loud and annoying. I'm not saying that the laser tag crowd is all trashy, but just by observing the location, I can see that often, this is what would happen to be there...   On to the food: the bolognese is Very decent. Not the greatest ever, but it totally does the job. The con for me is the meat. It is quite chewy. Perhaps an upgrade in quality of the meat will improve the taste and overall texture. It's $10 for this dish and I would not mind paying $13-15 if they upgraded the ingredients used.   The dish comes with a salad. I did not eat it now (too full) but the vinaigrette was okay. It wasn't spectacular and maybe a little sour.. As if the balsamic used is mixed with white vinegar or if it is just.. Young/not good quality. But, edible and does the job of a free salad.   The dish also comes with garlic bread. It is not really the typical, crispy and delicious garlicky bread. It's more of like a dry focaccia soaked in butter/garlic sauce. It's a bit soggy and missing that great garlic bread crunch. It is tasty, but not what I was expecting or looking forward to.   Couple of suggestions:  -Please do not staple bags so much -- Oh my gosh.  -You do not need to put salad leaves in a container and then put it in a paper bag and staple it all around.  -There is not need to use SO much foil to wrap up the dressing container. A simple piece of tape across the lid and onto the sides would have been enough.    I feel that the paper bag and all that foil and extra plastic bag to put all this stuff in is such a waste and it could save the establishment significant money (and to the customers, the waste) if this step were to be avoided. It's completely excessive.   Nice place. I'll come back and try some other stuff. I saw a big dough mixer and I'm hoping that they are putting it to excellent use."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great friendly people. You feel at home eating amazingly food. It wasn't very crowded so the guy took time to learn my name and check up on me and the meal I ordered.  I had the spinach ravioli and it was light and delicious and well flavored. I also had the wonderfully garlic garlic knots - to die for.  Can't wait to come back as try more"}
{"text":"After reading a story about Maru's, I decided to give it a try.  I drove there and ordered a Sicilian style half pizza with four cheeses.  The gentleman wanted to make sure that I knew that each of the cheeses was an extra topping.  I also ordered mushrooms but there were none.  I waited for the pizza to be baked and then I brought it home.  The pizza was good and large enough that it provided 1 1/2 meals.  They gave me a small bag with lots of napkins and extra cheese and three packets of crushed red pepper.  That's a nice touch.  I was pleased with the pizza but I'm not sure the value is there.  $20 for a half Sicilian?  And, it's an extra drive for me to go here.  I can get the same or better only 2 miles from home instead of going to Maru's.  I;m glad I tried it but I'll stay with my tried and true pizza vendors."}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm always open to new spots to enjoy a good pizza. Maru's became the guinea pig night of UFC 187.  We got the wings and a large pie. I'll say this, the dough was on point. It was so soft and sweet it almost didn't seem real.  I loved the wings. My dad prefers them to be a little crispier, but he's a little picky. I enjoyed them to the fullest. They were each a great size and were no slouch on meat.  The delivery man even came with a smile and took the alternative route as to not bother us even though there was a shorter route to take. He made sure the first time we saw him, he'd have the order in hand instead of having us get up to open the homeowner's gate. That alone earned an extra on the tip!  Great service, great pizza, great wings. Great job Maru's!"}
{"text":"This place literally saved my life. Lol. (Of course that's a bit over exaggerated, but it felt like it at the time) So it's 9pm, I'm working a night shift at the office and I was painfully hungry. Unfortunately for me I had a super craving for spaghetti & meatballs. Nothing else sounded appetizing at all. This place didn't even come up on my Yelp at first, so I had tried to order from another place, 20 minutes go by & I'm getting excited for my food, when instead I receive a phone call telling me that their driver went home for the night. Seriously? Why did you accept the order & charge me then? It was frustrating, but whatever, I start searching again & now I'm getting frantic because it seems like all of the places who have pasta are now closed... I find this place & call immediately. Didn't even stop to look for a menu.  Super nice gentleman takes my order, tells me it will be here in about 25 minutes. Fantastic! That's half of the time that the other place said.  The guy who delivered was even early (THANK YOU, sooo hungry!) Got my foodies all nice & hot. Totally hit the spot. Meatballs were huge & super juicy. Pasta was amazing. And of course, garlic bread! Mmmm! Everything just tasted fresh, so yums!  I seriously only got through half of it, there was so much food. Pretty much got two meals out of it. The price was really good for the amount and quality of the food that I got. Since its conveniently near my work & it was so good, I will definitely be ordering again, I won't wait until I'm starving next time though. I'm seriously looking forward to trying all the pastas & pizzas. Thanks again guys! Totally fantastic!"}
{"text":"The cooks don't wash their hands they just wipe their hands on their clothes and began making a new meal (with their bare dirty hands) they also don't wear hairnets .and the way management talks to their employees I've never seen anything like it this place is disgusting.I was literally right next to the kitchen as this older man was screaming at this young server .I will never eat here again but as far as I know no one else does too, I visit that plaza often ,and it is always empty in there. they should just close their doors to be honest......"}
{"text":"Some good pizza, got the gluten free one. A bit pricier then most places but good pizza. Worth a shot and have a pretty big menu I'll definitely look to try other stuff off of it"}
{"text":"Will never come here again.   We came here after a few games of laser tag next door. My friends were all super amped up from the hour of laser tag, so we were being a bit silly, but I'm sure they are used to questionable late night customers.   We only ordered two slices for our friend (most of us had eaten earlier). I put a tip in their jar. Pizza was good! Nothing special, but nice and hot.   One of my friends made the mistake of putting his hands behind him on one of the tables and the granite top flipped off and hit the floor, coming undone from the base. Most of the tables in here were already really shaky, including the one we were sitting at, so I wouldn't be surprised if this happens again, or if it's happened before.  The owner demanded he pay for it on the spot. We thought he was joking...he was not.  He was immediately on the phone with someone about the repair cost. He was speaking Spanish, so we couldn't understand him. My friend paid the owner in full: $75!!! I felt that the owner was really rude about what was a small accident. He didn't even thank us for owning up to a mistake, which may not even have been our fault.   I highly doubt another customer would've been so quick to pay for an accident without an official estimate on the repair, but we are nice people.    I will never go back here."}
{"text":"Just was craving some Calamari & pizza - as usual the order was delicious & delivered a lot soon than expected! Well done Maru's!"}
{"text":"Update.  2 1/2 hours later, I heard knock knock.  Who is there?  Maru's!  The owner saw the review and sent another pizza.    This time it was as I remembered.  I'm happy to find out that it was just one time thing.  As the delivery person said, the last one must have had too much veggies=soggy pizza.    Now my question marks have disappeared, it's time for their tiramisu!  I wanted to thank the owner taking a review seriously.  I never expected another pizza.    Previous review: It's so sad.  I loved it when they first opened.  Pizza was delivered in great condition last time I ordered.  Hot and not soggy.  Now I don't know what happened.  It was delivered within 30 minutes.  The store is about 10 minutes away.  The crust was baked nicely but it was not hot.  The half of the pizza was inedible. Has it been previously frozen?  I don't know.  The meatball pieces were also mushy.  It was just so awful.  The whole time we picked at the edible part of pizza, question marks just went through my head.  Imagine soaking a pizza slice into water....ugh.      I know I should eat it at the store first before judging on their pizza but it was too disappointing for me to even think of trying it again.  I also ordered tiramisu.  I have no desire to try that either with my nausea at this point.  Really.  I would never said no to sweets unless I lose complete trust in the food.  That being said, the service was very good.  I really liked the gentleman who took my order as well as the one who delivered.  Hence, two stars for service.  Someday I will try it at the restaurant....someday."}
{"text":"First of all, I would like to apologize to the delivery guy for my little chihuahua jumping all over him. Second of all, sorry I didn't have any bills to tip you and had to tip you with a bunch of quarters. Anyway, I'll be a lot more prepared next time, if you will be so kind as to come back and deliver for me. Maybe I'll pick up the food from now on.   Oh, on to the food. Their chicken Alfredo pizza is so delicious. If it were a person and I were single, I would ask it out. Their ingredients taste so fresh and the dough, OMG that dough seems like it made it up to heaven when they were tossing it around. I have never been to Italy, but if this is what real Italian pizza resembles, I'm booking a trip there next year.   I also had the pasta carbonara, which was a little salty for my taste. Otherwise, all the flavors were there.  The only negative thing is I was only able to eat one slice of pizza, because I was too full after that and some pasta. Haha Well, that's not really negative, is it?"}
{"text":"Maru's COMPLETELY changed my mind!!!! After writing a bad review, Maru's' owner Rosa called me the next day, apologized, and offered anything from their menu free of charge. Loved the customer service getting a call from the owner.   We ordered the stuffed pizza and wings. The stuffed pizza originally comes with sausage, pepperoni and ham. We substituted bacon for ham added meatball and added ricotta and bleu cheese. The cheese was so delicious and rich made for a great slice of pie. All the meat in that was stuffed made it like a meat lovers calzone. The bacon was authentic and tasted right, the meatball were fresh and the crust was crispy  and filled with cheese.  Would highly recommend their stuffed pizza!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on a whim and it was amazing. He had the Gorgonzola Linguini which was fresh and home made. I had the Pollo Florentine where the vegetables were cooked to perfection . The vegetable soup also had freshly cut veggies in it and was seasoned perfectly. They have fresh bread and the desserts are amazing. I had the flan which is served with dulce du leche and my husband had the tiramisu. I liked it so much that I drove across town the next night to try it again. I even got a piece of tiramisu for the husband since he couldn't be there. He playfully called me a devil woman for going without him again...lol. The waitress Jane is wonderful, so nice and accommodating and the food comes out super fast."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience and will definitely be going back. The food was wonderful and the service was even better. I am very happy we decided to try a new place. I watched the manager help an old lady out of her seat and personally serve us dessert. Seems like a great group of people and can't wait to try my next dish!"}
{"text":"The food here was good. The take out service was friendly. The atmosphere was not welcoming. I never understand  a restaurant that doesn't get how a restaurant needs to fulfill multiple items or why be in business? If you want done in customers, cater to dine in customers. Have a real coke soda fountain... Try a freestyle. Use real restaurant commercial napkins, utensils and cups. Don't try to be frugal with the small stuff especially while charging premium prices.  Pizza, lasagna and zeppoli's were good!"}
{"text":"Came here while visiting family and got the supreme pizza.  It was delicious and our server Roxanne went above and beyond to make sure our visit exceeded our expectations."}
{"text":"Id like to say the pizza was better...but it was average. Not amazing, but far from bad. On the plus side, deliverey was cheap (like $1.00) they were super nice on the phone and the delivery guys was nice too.  The rest of the large menu looked intriguing and ill probably try a pasta or a sandwich in the future."}
{"text":"Loved it! My cousin and I randomly came across this place .. The server was nice and welcoming! They even gave us two free slices of pizza to try. The pizza and pasta tasted great!. Reasonable prices and great service - can't top that."}
{"text":"Tried the pizza again (owner offered to send us a free one) turns out that the wrong cheese was used on the first one and the second one was much better. Good crust and my roommate liked the vegan meatballs a lot. We look forward to trying them again."}
{"text":"Easily the best pasta in town. Everything is home made and I haven't had an alfredo sauce this good since forever. From the appetizers to the desert everything is great. I've eaten here multiple times and never been disappointed. The tiramisu is amazing my wife's favorite."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant when my friends and I rented out the laser tag joint next door. That night I had a slice of pizza & tiramisu. It was so good. I have since been back a couple more times and have tried the rigatoni ala bolognese with italian sausage, meat lasagna, fettucini alfredo & flan with dulce de leche. Everything has been amazing. They make all their pasta, breads & pizza dough in house from scratch as well as everything else. Spiced just right, creamy goodness. The staff are very nice. I have recommended this to friends and none have been disappointed. For the people who complain about soggy french fries & chicken strips from delivery, what did you expect? French fries are always soggy upon delivery unless they are from a fast food restaurant. Next time, do yourself a favor and order italian food, from the italian restaurant you called...leave the chicken & fries for Cane's...this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"Four stars??? Really Yelp? The pizza was some of the worst I've ever had. No real taste. Very disappointing folks. Usually yelp doesn't miss. It did here. We were in the dining area for a half hour solid. NOBODY came in. It was just us. Most of the time, popular lunch places are slammed at the lunch our. They were not. Bad food, nice people."}
