{"text":"FANTASTIC!  I love this place.  The food is outstanding (all of it), the staff are super friendly and helpful and it's eat-off-the-floor clean."}
{"text":"Me and my husband LOVE LOVE Nello's! We have been going for years and it is by far our favorite place to go for a night out!"}
{"text":"Nello's is the only place to go for wings. They are always big and although double baked is great, triple baked is even better. Takes longer but allows you time to enjoy the company of the patrons and staff. I have never had a bad visit and recommend Nello's to all my friends."}
{"text":"It's a really good pizza place. I don't have anything to compare it too, cause this place is close to home, has the best reviews, and fulfills all my expectations - so it's the only pizzeria I've been to since coming to AZ (way to retain your customers Nello's :) 

I can't comment on service, because I always pick up, but the person by the counter is always very respectful and nice. 

I really like their original thick crust pizzas - I had spinach pie pizza (EXCELLENT), BBQ chicken pizza (it was OK) and the margarita pizza (simple but tasty). 

Overall, this is definately a place to try if you haven't been :)"}
{"text":"This is a great place for friends.  We had the garlic bread that was fantastic, not too much garlic, a great crunch, you should try this.  The eggplant brochette was tasty also, we could have made a meal on these two items alone.  But, we split the strawberry salad that was as fresh as fresh can be and the penne pasta that was as italian as it gets.  Really enjoyed our visit.  Only downside was the smoke that we walked thru on exiting the place from the smoking customers outside."}
{"text":"To start off I don't know how this place is rated an average 4.5 stars maybe the people who wrote them should try the food BEFORE  they drink their alcohol.
My  wife, kids and myself went here the evening of May 26, 2016. My wife and my daughter had their spaghetti which was bland and quite frankly way too much of a portion. My son had their \"famous\" meatball sub which was also very bland. We also ordered a large thin crust deluxe pizza which you guessed it, very bland.
Their chicken wings were absolutely disgusting, small and fatty, probably because they bake them instead of deep-frying them like they should be.
We ended up taking most of it home only because the bill was $82 plus tip.
So do yourself a favor and skip this place."}
{"text":"I visited Nellos on a Thursday night with my two children. the hostess was unfriendly from the start. After waiting 20 minutes, she called our names, started walking, as she tossed 3 menus on the table and kept going. She later returned with 3 stacked plates that she left on the table without comment. After waiting too long, we ordered. It took at least 15 minutes to get a horrible salad. Both the house dressing and balsamic dressing were awful. The salad was tasteless. The pizza was not bad, but not good either. We finally got the check, paid, and walked passed the scowling hostess. Whatever happened to the Nellos of old? Never again."}
{"text":"My daughter said it all when she said, \"There  are no words to describe this pizza!\"  We ordered a garden salad, which fed our family of 4.  The house dressing was awesome!  We then Had the buffalo wing pizza.  It was so flavorful, and the crust was amazing!  Good selection of beers!  We will return!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza in the southwest. Nice crust with amazing sauce. Best pizza from cheese pizza to loaded Chicago style pizza. When you step in you are visiting chi-town. With the cubs, bears, bulls and Blackhawks memorabilia! Best pizza in town. Renember to go to the one in MESA."}
{"text":"A darn good Pizza!

We've been here twice so far, through the recommendation of a friend. The location is not the greatest and you would never expect how great the quality of the pizza is. 

The first time I went there, I got two 7 inch pizza's, I'd say this is a personal pan pizza size. I got the Spinach Pie and the Santa Fe Chicken with Original Deep Dish Crust (they have a Thin Crust option as well). The Santa Fe Chicken was good, eventhough the chicken was a little dry. The Spinach Pie was AMAZING!!!! This is what a vegetarian pizza is suppose to taste like...pure awesomeness!

The second time, I got a 12 inch (enough for 2 people and/or left overs): half Pesto Bianco w/ chicken and half BBQ Chicken with Wheat Deep Dish Crust. The chicken yet again was dry, so I was noticing a team with the chicken. Luckily I don't judge a pizza place by it's chicken, so that bodes wel for Nello's. I can understand how chicken can dry out during the cooking process. As for the pizza itself, the BBQ was decent (it reminded me of a generic CPK BBQ chicken pizza) and the Pesto was pretty good. All in all, it was the wheat crust that sold us this time.

Thus far, I would recommend the Spinach Pie with Wheat Deep Dish Crust!"}
{"text":"Normally, I'd give Nello's a better rating, but with the combination of a bad meal and even worse customer service bia phone, It's not.

I ordered a small pizza with a large salad for pickup.  Ticket says time of 4:52.  I ran to safeway just next to it to grab a pie and then proceeded to pick up my meal.  Now the charge came thru on my phone at the time of 5:22 so total time from phone order to pick up was a half hour.  By the time I got home (less than 5 minutes from the location) the pizza was so cold we could not eat it nor the bread that came with it.

I promptly called and asked for the Manager and was given Jason.  I explained our situation and was promptly told that it had been sitting there an hour, when by time proof it was 1/2 hour total time, call in to pick up.  I did not call for anything but to give a heads up about our situation.  The call ended, no thank you for calling, nothing.  He just hung up on me.

Uniquely, Jason's name was on the receipt we have with the time stamp.

Although we have been going to Nello's since we moved down the road  over 2yrs ago, we will be driving farther into chandler to Floridino's due to the poor customer service we received today.  If the customer service from the \"manager\" on duty was better I may have given Nello's another chance, but it won't get my $$$ now.

{"text":"Lots of different options and good pizza too! Our server was a little off, but mayeb she was just having a weird day."}
{"text":"My darling wife asked me where I wanted to go for my Birthday and I said Nellos on Alma. Living 38 minutes away, I will continue to come here because Brian the owner, the staff, and food are fantastic. The other bar stool occupants are great conversationalist and make new clientele welcomed.  Very neighborhood family friendly. We each ordered a pizza and salad. The salad was fresh and crisp. The house dressing is very special.  Its Brian's moms secret recipe. I loved it because im a spicy italian, french/russian type of guy. Thats the best way to describe it without giving. Away secret ingredient. My wife's deep dish pizza was delicious. Sauce was flavorful and had just the right amount of spices in it. Being from Wisconsin, she loved the sausage because it reminded her of Johnsonville brats and sausages. I ordered thin crust and loved it as much as the deep dish. The dough and fresh toppings really makes the pizza.  The food is so good here. I cant wait to comeback and try some of there pastas, sandwiches and fries. Since it was my birthday,  Brian gave me a freshly made cheesecake with fresh, not canned, strawberries.  It was made by his wife everyday. You can tell lots of love went into it. Loved the flavor, amarretto and very rich. Crust was very good too.
Being in the restaurant / hospitality business for over 40 years, this is the type of place that keeps people happy. And coming back. Great dining experience again. Wish this place was up in my neighborhood. Keep up the Great customer service and work.
Chef John"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza every time!! Everything is made fresh! Love the house dressing and skinny pizza!! Regular crust is out of this world ! Also they have a very good gluten free pizza much better than  most!! Never had a bad meal! We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for almost 30 years.  Evidently since just after they opened we found out the other night.  The food is always awesome, service is good and the smell, yum.  Smells the same way it did 30 years ago, delicious!  Best deep dish pizza around.  Definitely our favorite."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA: 5 Stars all the way!  Nello's famous motto; \" In Crust We Trust!\" forever holds true!  This is the BEST deep dish Chicago pizza in the Valley of the Sun bar none! 

My sister originally found Nello's over 28 years ago (some of their original customers) when it was a one or two table small outfit located in a single wide strip mall store front at McClintock and Southern.  We loved the Numero - Uno with gourmet sausage and mushrooms ever since! Telling hundreds of people over the years how good the place was has caused them to grow into a doublewide store then triplewide and now currently four or five valley locations!  We make it a point to bring every one of our guests here and they never leave dissappointed. 

What makes Nello's soooooo good has to be the crust and sauce! We make it a point to ask for a side of the pizza sauce to dip our crusts in total enjoyment.  Make sure to start with a Mozzarella Platter for an appetizer while waiting for the pie to arrive!

My favorite after the #1 is the Alaskan King seafood pizza with white sauce w/ mushies, green peppers and fresh tomatoes. Sometimes I special order the Numero Uno with the Alaskan Crab extra if you enjoy the red sauce more - Delicious!

Our kids love the Hawaiian topped with loads of mozz, ham and a generous portion of pineapple chunks. 

Where else can you order up an Enchilada Pizza??  Southwestern red sauce topped with tender grilled chicken, black olives, onions and green chiles sour cream and guacamole.  Mmmm SPICEY!

Deluxe Combo can't be beat fully loaded, or try the Skinny: Homemade sausage, pepperoni, salami, meatballs, and bacon! That is the Pie of all Pies! 

For side drinks, my wife from South Africa loves to get a picher of Guava Juice to soak in a flavor from home and this is a great place to take kids or buddies for a game on the many TVs.

The Murphy with bacon and onions or what used to be known as the Popeye: Fresh Spinach, garlic, mushies, tomatoes, olive oil, mozz and feta cheese. The list goes on from BBQ Chicken to the Buffalo Wing Pizza that packs a punch!! 

What more can I say?? I'm gettin' hungry writing this FIVE star review! Go and see why they have won the New Times Best of Phoenix some 10 or 15 years!

PS: A little tip if you order 4 pizzas ya get da 5th one FREE :)) Stock up and put 'em in your fridge.  Also check out my review for the Aloha Kitchen next door to Nello's as it is the best Hawaiian food in PHX....Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. The also just started making their own pasta. The house salad dressing is just about the best thing there. I use it to dip my pizza in."}
{"text":"If you like real Chicago style pizza this is the best in the Phoenix area.  I've been eating here for several years and this is hands-down the best.

Really nice atmosphere for families. Great staff.  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"The food here was really good.  We started off with the garlic bread covered in tomatos and mozzarella, which was tasty.  My wife and I split a salad with the house italian dressing, and it was huge!  We ended up splitting it with the whole table, and it was fantastic.  I guess the dressing really makes a difference, because I'm usually not that enamored of salads!  I had the murphy pizza, which was very good."}
{"text":"Great place. Traditional pizza joint. This place has been here forever and I know why. Quality food, great beer and great service.  I would recommend the pumpkin porter.  Jessica was our server and she was great."}
{"text":"WOW! Can you imagine the stoke of luck when we moved in right behind Nello's? It took us a year to decide to try this place. I can't imagine life without Nello's. You have to try the bacon & mushroom deep dish. Or go crazy and get all meat! Feel the arteries clogggggg... seriously folks you can't go wrong. They have a faithful following who show up every Friday and Saturday night so go early or go late so you can get a table!  Also try the canollis!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great price, excellent atmosphere!  Beer and wine to compliment our meal at an affordable price! Very comfortable and welcoming atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Some of the Best Pizza you can have is at Nello's Pizza.  This pizza is most certainly worth it.  I've heard that all the Nello's are great, but I can only speak on this one.  The Staff is great and the food is Magnificent.  Nice wine list too."}
{"text":"Love this place, there salad dressing alone is worth the trip. Original crust Hawaiian is my favorite but everything is good."}
{"text":"I love Nello's! Pizza, sandwiches, or wings you won't be disappointed. The wait staff is prompt and personable, and the food is always top notch. Drinks come in giant cups so there is no slow down while you're enjoying your deep dish. This is a great destination for a lunch break."}
{"text":"Best pizza on the planet. Never disappoints when I go. I tried the turkey avocado for a change and it was fantastic as well. It's hard to get anything other than pizza but I thought I would take a shot. Wish I had one closer to me in Queen Creek."}
{"text":"We eat piazza at least once a week ( maybe that's the Italian in us) . My husband, the kids we all love this place. My kids are extremely picky eaters. If it was for them we would have pizza everyday. But not any, only nello's.  Actually we just had it for dinner last night. It was so good."}
{"text":"Great salads and pizza that are winners every time. Love the regular crust and the fresh vegetables. A bit noisy at times but tolerable."}
{"text":"Great pizza, AWESOME salads with their house dressing and as always, a fun and lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love love love Nello's! Our family has been coming here for about 20 years and we have never had a bad meal. Brian and Rio are the best and this place feels like Home to us."}
{"text":"First of all, a bowl of iceberg lettuce with an unripe tomato and 4 massive carrot shavings does not qualify as a dinner salad. This pizza we ordered was mediocre. The sauce was far too sweet and everything else was just 'meh.' The service in general was lackluster. The restaurant wasn't very busy at all with just a handful of customers, yet our waitress managed to bypass our table numerous times before collecting the check."}
{"text":"Two stars are for very nice and quick servers. The pizza, parmigiana sandwiches and sauce in general are too sweet and not flavored well with any spices. The happy hour is great, and I'd definitely head back for that and some non-tomato based appetizers."}
{"text":"They have such good pizza. OMG their cheesecake is to die for literally. I think I am addicted to the cheesecake."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I've had since moving to Az. The employees are always friendly and efficient and the deep dish pizza's are excellant!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite pizza joint outside Chicago. 

The ownership and staff are awesome! It is a win win, you get great food and you get to support good people. Make sure you order the Murphy. You'll thank me for It."}
{"text":"Been enjoying Nellos for years!  Great value and consistently great food and service.  Always feel comfortable and happy when I decide not to cook and go to Nellos."}
{"text":"The service is the star here, and the pizza is just as good!  I've eaten here several times, both alone and with friends, and am always treated really well.  Not every restaurant treats solo diners well, so I really appreciate their kindness.  My friends think Nello's is great too! Yum!"}
{"text":"Not sure of the issue but haven't been able to access Nello's menu or web site in quite some time. It too bad they have some of the best pizzas in town."}
{"text":"I had heard of his restaurant for years from friends and family. Coming from the East I was hoping for a great meal. The pizza crust was dry, salad was soggy and the service less than helpful. When aske to see the manager, they were nowhere to be found. NOT IMPRESSED!"}
{"text":"Best pizza! Love the pizza crust as an appetizer and then the thin crust pizza for dinner/lunch."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten here for quite a while, but I'm glad I did! The environment is louder but that's because it's mixed with restaurant and bar. The service is great and friendly. The portion sizes were large & plenty. Choices, choices, choices too....salad, pasta, pizza....so many choices in each type of food. To top it off...awesome pizza!!! Why did I stay away so long???? Be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Nello's Pizza for over 10 years now. I used to eat just pepperoni pizza but then I discovered the Margarita pizza.  And then I discovered the bacon, green pepper, gouda pizza!   This is the best, most amazing \"pizza\" (which should be an item on the menu)!!  This is full-size bacon -- I'm talking full-size bacon -- best in the world!  Also I highly recommend the triple baked wings.  If you been here a few times you know the nickname for these wings.  The staff here is dedicated and the food service is very efficient.   Love the craft beer selection as well.   Eat here tonight!"}
{"text":"I'm not even a fan of pizza, but I love this place. Super friendly wait staff and ice cold Stella Artois on draft. I'd post a picture of my awesome pizza, but they keep the place dimly lit. When I feel like pizza, I drive to Mesa."}
{"text":"Nello's pizza is a fun place to eat with good food. The service has always been top notch and all of their items are of good quality. I do not enjoy ranch dressing, but the praises everyone sings about it on Yelp rings true with my friends I have brought here who do like it. 

I highly suggest everyone in the area come by Nello's and try the food. For me, it's just not my style. The first few times I tried it I love it, but i find myself preferring a more traditional NY style pie. Especially not for the premium price."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Staff it's nice and friendly.
We go there regularly and they have gluten free, thin crest pizza. 
There is not that many places that do gluten free but this place does."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing!  Great service which is always appreciated... But the pizza is to die for.  Best bacon you'll find anywhere and a very impressive 15 beers on tap.  It's not just good, it's  Nello's good!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly service. This was our first time here. We had the combo deep dish pizza. It was really good. Loaded with fresh veggies & ingredients. Good beer selections and TV's if you're looking to catch a college or pro game."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, good service, fair prices and big portions. I used to eat here over a decade ago when I was younger. It's just as good as I remember."}
{"text":"\"In crust we trust\"--The Constitution of Pizza. This historical declaration of pizza is a timeless American value. In other words, the pizza was great! Ordered a lot: garden salad with Nello's house dressing (unique and delicious sauce), the pizza Bianca (a sauceless wonder), the Hawaiian (Maui, is that you?!), and a classic pepperoni! One member of our dinner party found the pepperoni somewhat salty. However, the pizza dough was simultaneously soft and crunchy at the crust and the sauce is a rich tomatoey goodness! I'd come back; only draw back was the wait"}
{"text":"*Nom nom nom*

That's the sound of me munching on my yummy pizza from Nello's - fast service, friendly folk and great pizza? My kind of place!!!"}
{"text":"Garlic bread delicious! Pizza phenomenal! Wish it was more like deep dish but crust tasted great! Staff was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Had a huge group of 40+ today. They put us in the patio which was relaxing. Poor waitress dealt w/the group by herself & did awesome. H2o was constantly filled & the beers kept coming.  Thick crust pizza is legit. We had the thin crust spinach pie, which was delicious. Definitely family friendly pizza place."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this Nello's location for the last 15 years. The pizzas here are awesome and always piping hot. The owner Brian is friendly and willing to make your experience better if it is lacking which it never is at this Nello's. They make the salads fresh to order and the house dressing is SO good! it is even good to dip the crust of your pizza in! I have had every pizza on the menu. I have had the pizza in thin crust and deep dish. Either way you prefer the crust is tasty. I like too that they offer a wheat crust for those of us that are trying to avoid the bleached flour. NELLO'S YOU ROCK! Keep up the good work Brian!"}
{"text":"I love Nello's pizza.  I have been a fan of Nello's since the 90's.  The pizza is always hot and cooked, ingredients are fresh and the options are plentiul.  They have local beers on tap, including my favor - 4 peaks peach ale!!  I would recommend trying out their deluxe combo or the pizza bianca with sun dried tomato, mushroom and sausage with a side of marinara. You will always get quality when you go to Nello's and you can expect that get great pizza everytime.  

Top food recommendations:

And a cold beer from the draft to go with it, you can't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here once a few years back so it could totally be different now but based on my experience about 10yrs back, the pizza was mediocre and the staff was very slow. The restaurant was a little dirty. I tried this place for my 12th birthday because I had a high school friend working here at the time. My parents were astonished at how expensive it was for how \"okay\" everything was. It could totally be different now and I'm not sure but I'm willing to maybe come back and try this place again. I'll update on here if it's gotten better."}
{"text":"My family and I first experienced Nellos during a visit to AZ (before we moved here). We were staying in Scottsdale near a small location that no longer exists. We were super excited to see that there is a larger location still serving up the tasty pie! This \"Chicago style\" pie is tasty but considerably different from the chi-town pie that we experienced at Lou Malnatti's and Pizzeria Uno in the Windy City. We were pleasantly surprised to find that an order of cheese bread is basically a large pizza crust with cheese, very generous! Our family loved the pizzas and the giant salads! Pricing is about on par with other pizzerias, service and cleanliness were good as well. There were also \"old school\" video games such as Ms Pac-Man that our kids enjoyed. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Strawberry fields salad is soooo good. The service is amazing. The ambiance is romantic on a cool night out on the patio. I can't say enough about this place!"}
{"text":"This location is the reason we stopped dining at Nello's.  I have lived in the Valley for 23 years and been patronizing them until about 6 years ago. The last time we ate here, we decided the food had just gone down hill. It wasn't the waitstaff or anything else, the food was just mediocre at best.
A couple of months ago we stopped in at the Scottsdale & Shea location; the food was fantastic. We were not sure if it was a fluke, so we visited the same location again. Same great food.   
Unfortunately, we stopped in at the Alma School location today because it is closer to our home, the food was horrible. I couldn't even finish my sandwich, the meat tasted like it had been sitting in the back, drying out for hours. The food is definitely not the same at this location. I wasn't sure why the food would vary so much, until I overheard the waitress tell another table that each location has different owners.  I'm not sure if that is true, but I definitely won't be going back to this location!"}
{"text":"We ordered a meatball sub,   a sausage sub and a deep dish pizza. Very nice sauce on the subs and meatballs and their house made sausage is quite nice. The pizza is just so so. Not bad but also did not rock my world. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Really really good pizza.  This place is right in my back yard, never knew about it, prices are good, pizza is great, beer was cold... what more do you need?! 

I've had three amazing pizza's there... kinda wanting to go back now... busy place expect a short wait.

Ok, what else is there to say about a pizza sports bar?"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok. Service was not so great. If you like attentive service and good pizza for a good price, don't come here....go to spinattos! I ordered a spinach pie, and could count on one hand how much spinach was in it. Garlic bread had no garlic. Crust is decent but has no taste.  One last thing...dont order the antipasto salad. 16 dollars for a big bowl of nothing. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"One of their oven broke, we waited over a hour for the pizza...when we got the pizza it wasn't even hot...waiter forgot the spaghetti dish...we were patiently waiting...didn't get anything taken off or a coupon for next trip...I will give it another try"}
{"text":"Delicious and love the gluten free option. I went with a friend for lunch last Wednesday, we got a gluten free deluxe, thin crust deluxe, and pizza we created using a variety of toppings. All of the pizzas were amazing! The server was attentive and very nice. 

When I told another co-worker about how delicious my pizzas were, she told me it's been a long since she ordered  a pizza there because she loves the salads so much she forget to order a pizza.

Tonight, we phoned in a to go order. The person that answered was very friendly and confirmed my order with me before ending the call. My husband is one his way to pick up a world salad and two gluten free pizzas :) We definitely recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"This is one of the good Nello's!  Good service and usually packed with local Mesa and Chandler townie families, baby chairs included.  They serve Grolsch in the bottle which is rare.  Always decent and never quiet.  We love it for eating in or take out."}
{"text":"I have eaten Nello's many times (my office orders from here quite often and who am I to turn down free food) and I can say they are consistent and I consistently don't like it. The pizza here is what I would call major deep dish which I don't have a problem with but is probably not my first choice. My main issue with Nello's is their sauce is very sweet -- probably the sweetest pizza sauce I have ever tasted. This just ruins it for me, but I should mention I generally don't like any sugar in my marinara (what's wrong with tangy vinegar?).  The only pizza that is passable here IMO is the meat lovers with bacon on top (not sure the official name). The salad is ok... and their house dressing is interesting -- definitely different."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my wife this past Friday night, and gotta say Nello's will probably become my go to pizza place from here on out. When we arrived we were seated pretty fast within minutes. Our server was Chris, he got to us quickly and took our drink order, and brought them to us in a timely manner. My wife order the Hawaiian mini for herself and I ordered a small pepperoni with smoked bacon, we also ordered a side of fries and hot wings for both of us. The food came out in what I'd consider average for a pizza place. The fries were good not overly greasy like you'd get in other places, they were crunchy yet still had some potato in there so thumbs up from both of us. The wings were pretty big so that's a plus, flavor wise I'd say they were about average for hot wings, we'll be sure to try a different flavor on our next visit. Now for the pizza my wife enjoyed her Hawaiian, she said the flavor was good but above all else she loved the crust. My bacon an pep was also great loved that they use nice good sized pieces of bacon instead of just little bacon bits. Now back to our server, Chris came by maybe twice to refill our drinks he wasn't pushy or annoying how other servers can be with constantly coming by to ask how things are. So all in all great pizza plus great service we will definitely be coming by again."}
{"text":"Really good pizza... we have not tried the other menu items yet. It appears the place is a hangout for a lot of regulars. That says something about the food. Service was fine.  Only issue was people going outside the front door and smoking on the patio (close to the door). I didn't think this was permitted."}
{"text":"We are frequent and loyal customers of Nello's, especially since we live right across the street.  Every time we have eaten there, the service has been outstanding.  Last night we ventured out, even though we knew it would be busy with it being Valentine's Day.  We waited less than 5 minutes to be seated, which was awesome.  Although the place was moderately busy, we waited for over 30 minutes for our small thin crust pizza.  Even though our patience was wearing thin, our server, Ryan, was so extremely nice.  He kept checking in on the kitchen and providing updates to us.  Ultimately, we were comped our pizza because of the delay, which we appreciated.  Ryan went above and beyond and gave us a wonderful dessert to take home to ensure we still enjoyed our evening.  THANK YOU Ryan for providing excellent service! Pizza was worth the wait and we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and have only found places I like.  Hadn't tried Nellos and heard it was good, so my wife and I went there today for lunch.  We had their thin crust deluxe.  Was disappointed.  It was very thin, but crust was not airy, like I am used to.  And being from Chicago, I like my Italian Sausage, not pepperoni.  The sausage was bland and was almost freeze dried.  No flavor, not moist.  It crumbled.  Very disappointed.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Delicious garlic bread and the mini pizza was enough for one person.  Ingredients were fresh and the waitress was very friendly.  Prices were reasonable and the music being played wasn't too loud.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I've had. I've never dined in the restaurant, but we order from here for work all the time and it's delicious!!! If you're looking for a tasty fair priced pizza visit this location. The staff is always friendly too when we pick up our order :)"}
{"text":"Nellos is consistently good and I have been going for over 20 years.  Love their Garden Salad with the house dressing.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Food awesome, Service awesome, a great hangout spot. I drive 35 minutes just to come and have a great day. Brian and all the staff are like family. They treat you right. There are so many food options, you cant be disappointed. It's all fabulous. The sauce and ingredients on the pizzas are perfect. Love the sausage. You really taste tomatoes and NOT tin or metal from cans. If you really want good pie, pizza, come and dine here. Sandwiches look and taste delicious. Mouthwatering.
Chef John's stamp of Approval."}
{"text":"Consistent, delicious and fresh. My all-time favorite pizza place as of now and lucky it's so close to my house. Found this place on accident from google and decided to try it, but an unforgettable experience.. I just keep coming back, trying the Numero Uno, Deluxe Combo, Murphy, Spinach Pie, and Buffalo Wing pizza. Pizza is usually cut crooked, some pieces way bigger than others, but I think it gives it some character. All ingredients are customizable, flavorful and not greasy. Nello's kicks ass."}
{"text":"Everything on the pizzas was to die for, the crust these amazing toppings came on was the biggest disappointment. The crust seems like it was made after googling \"blandest bread dough ever\" and over-cooking the first recipe that came up until it was a charred crisp. 

You'd think a place that has it's employee's wear shirts bragging about their crust wouldn't be trying to compete with a Boy Scout's first attempt at making bread."}
{"text":"Ok so friends meet for dinner.  Six of us salad was good.  Wings were ok , not crispy, soggy skin sucks
Pizza sucked. I like thin pizza but not with cornmeal on the bottom and hardly any meat.   Not the best dinner.  I wanted good wing if you want good wings don't go to nelllo's"}
{"text":"I have been going to this Nello's since I moved to the valley. 

I have tried pretty much very pie they make and they are all delicious ! But I absolutely love their deluxe combo on thin or original deep dish. They even have gluten free crust!

Great pasta dishes that are large enough to share. I love their homemade Italian sausage. The salads are enough to feed a small army and their homemade house dressing is a must.

Great friendly service, at a great price!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great and the salads are yummy!! I recommend the peperoni and sausage pizza and a BIG house salad. The dressing is awesome and I like to dip my pizza, its better then ranch. Good service and great food, what else can you ask for."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm impressed! Years ago the past owner was one of my patients & we visited Nello's every so often & ALWAYS enjoyed it, but I lost touch with it.... I will not do that again! We stopped by on a fluke today because my husband was in the mood for pizza & there is no doubt about it - Nello's delivers! (no pun intended) I have known the food is great but today we received Superb service from our bartender Nick! From the moment we sat down it was like he was reading our minds... No questions asked just AWESOME customer service! Definitely want to mention since we are beer fans, that they have a nice selection on tap & you can't beat the price. Great Happy Hour Prices on Pitchers! My hiatus is over & we will definitely be back! Oh and they have a fantastic Napkin Artist - that's right I said Napkin Artist! Go check it out - it's pretty cool! Thanks Nello's (& Nick)!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Not nearly as good as I would've expected, given the price. We will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"Super good pizza....Server...not so much. Put our food down and disappeared. She never checked on us until it was tip time. Sorry but life doesn't work that way."}
{"text":"I normally would love to give this place a 4/5 stars but they've finally disappointed me with the lack of amenities for brining a baby/young infant. Bathroom does not have a changing table and they don't have car seat caddies if you bring your baby in a car seat. Service is always friendly and food is always great. Would still come here because their salad dressing is so good! Everything on the menu is great can't go wrong. :)"}
{"text":"Another local neighborhood favorite.  This place is always packed and always consistently good, well at least for the wings and fries as that's what I always get.  So in all around fairness this review is more for the wings, seasoned fries and cold beer.  

As I am a newfound wing fan, my first visit here was during my \"eat wings everywhere I went\" quest.  I will say I haven't stopped coming for the wings.  My #1 wingman (also known as Wife, Boss, Commander or Chief) and I usually order 6 each of the garlic Parmesan, honey BBQ, and medium with an order of seasoned fries.  The wings are baked to perfection, the seasoning always delicious and when you order crispy fries, they come out perfect.  I know this is a pizza place, so I can tell you they do offer mini pies 7\" to Large pies 14\".  They have spaghetti and lasagne on the menu and offer sandwiches.  I guess I'll have to try some time, but as a creature of habit I'll stick to the wings until they let me down."}
{"text":"Tried the restaurant for the very first time . My friends have raved about this place for years. Ordered Hawaiian pizza thin cryst. The service was slow . They paid more attention to phone orders than to customers at the restaurant.  The pizza was not fully cooked the crust was thin . It was a little light on toppings. The staff  serving me was not very friendly maybe just too busy"}
{"text":"Love Nellos pizza. We don't have it that often but when we do it's usually on celebrations. The cheese is so good and fresh. I do not care to much how the pizza is cut oddly? We love the Hawaiian pizza. I wish they could deliver, but we are never upset with the flavor and seasonings."}
{"text":"The wife and I took the kids here for Valentine's day.

Coming from Chicago, I'm a bit of a pizza snob. Chicago deep dish pizza is THE only way to go. It's a meal, you eat pizza with a fork and a knife. Not that paper plate crap. It's about the crust. That buttery flaky tasty goodness... mmm... I can feel my arteries clogging as I write. 

The reviews that I read, led me to believe that Nello's would be the place I've been searching for, since moving to AZ over 6 years ago. As their motto states, \"In crust, we trust\", so I took it as gold and I trusted their crust. Boy, was I disappointed. We got the heart shaped \"Valentines Special\", with their signature crust, half cheese and half pepperoni. 

Let me reiterate, I am a pizza snob and I have high expectations for great pizza. Sadly, this was just mediocre. It was pizza that I would get if I only had $5, was pulling an all nighter and needed a quick pizza. The crust was dried out. Not buttery. Not flakey. Not tasty. In fact, my kids and I didn't even finish the crust; which is my favorite part of a pizza.

The ambiance was great. The decor, lighting, bar and even the seating was comfy and inviting. The staff was excellent as well. So, as for what might bring me back, it's the staff.

In the end, it's an okay place. I'll probably come back sometime to give it another try. It really has potential and has received a ton of awards, so maybe I just caught an off night."}
{"text":"Get the \"fat free skinny pizza\" it is a carnivores dream. You will not be sorry. My friends ordered the \"kilt lifter\" beer and loved it."}
{"text":"I am officially on great pizza overload in this town.  Now that we've tried Nello's, it will be really hard to choose where to go the next time we're craving pizza (which is like every other day!).  

Yesterday we decided to try somewhere we'd never been and Nello's was the place.  We walked in and sat at the bar and right away were greeted by Joshua who took great care of us.  He was fun to talk to as well.

We started with a 1/2 doz. of the BBQ wings and those were nicely done and I think I managed to grab 2 before Mr. M scarfed them down like they owed him money.  They don't fry them, they bake them, which I can appreciate.  The less grease in my life the better.

I ordered the 7\" Pizza Bianca which was just four cheeses, but \"just\" four cheeses doesn't give this pizza credit.  The flavors were amazing!  This might be my new favorite pizza.  And I loved the crust.  Golden and buttery, chewy on the inside.  Perfect.

My husband ordered the 10\" Numero Uno, thin crust, which is sausage and mushroom.   This is our favorite pizza combo and it was great as well.  Chewy cheese and fresh, flavorful toppings.  It really doesn't get much better.

The cold beers were reasonable too.  I had a pint of Four Peaks peach ale, and Mr. M had 2 pints of the Franziskaner Hefe Weiss.  That took us right back to Germany.  Each beer was $4.50.  What a deal!  

All in we spent $36.36 before tip.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch with my awesome co-workers for the first time last week. I wanted something quick and easy so I ordered the Garlic Bread appetizer thinking it would be a small plate for me to pick at during the hour. Well, our waiter ended up bringing a HUGE plate of bread that was enough to feed all three of us and then some. The food took a while to come so our waiter made up for it by offering us free drinks! Wouldn't come back during my 12-1 lunch hour but would definitely pop back in when I had more time."}
{"text":"Get there early on weekend nights because it is popular! The staff was so great and friendly. We ordered the house salad and asian salad; both were very delicious and the house dressing is amazing! Definitely going to try to buy a bottle next time!

The pizza was very good, too! I'd recommend getting the original crust! The spinach pie was a great option, especially if you are looking for a vegetarian and lighter pizza option. We also got 1/2 Hawaiian and 1/2 pepperoni. You can't go wrong with any of the pizza options!"}
{"text":"For years and years, Nello's has always satisfied with a tasty pie. Be it thick or thin, large or small, the portions and ratios of toppings to crust has always been consistent and on spot on, which puts Nello's among some of the tastiest pizza restaurants in the East Valley. 

My go to pizza choices typically lean towards the original crust, which is to say that it is deep dish pan style. Not quite Chicago style deep, but pretty darn close. The crust tends to be cooked to a lightly browned, nearly done consistency for most every pie made. I would say however, they tend to lean towards slightly under, rather than over, on the cook of their original crust. However, both styles of crust yield a pleasantly satisfying texture, thickness and flavor, and at least have some tooth to them that stands up well to the ingredients heaped on top. 

Another favorite is the house salad dressing. It certainly goes well with most any style of salad ordered, however it often times doubles as an extra bit of saucy flavor that somehow finds its way onto my slice of pizza. More often than not, I'll just put that slice of pizza nestled right up to the salad, all on the same plate, creating my own version of what west coasters do when they put their salad atop top their pizza. I can also say that the marinara sauce is very tasty and is good on the side for heaping on extra goodness. 

The service is certainly congenial, and prompt. I've really never had a bad experience in all of the times I've gone -whether it be a large party or small. Lunch and dinner you can't go wrong: sandwiches, salads, calzones and pizza's are all very tasty. There is a good selection of beer and wine, even local flavors on tap and in bottles too; there is something to complement your meal, if you're not sure, just ask - I find the staff very helpful. 

Both locations are often busy, and it's no surprise, because the food and service are quite good . . . and they've been doing it since the 80's, so there you go!

{"text":"Exxxxxcellent pizza (had the spinach pie with wheat crust) and delish beer (Four Peaks!)  Service was perfect (left us to talk but was attentive when needed.)  Would definitely recommend for casual pizza & beer night!"}
{"text":"I so agree with Christopher B.  I am originally from Buffalo, NY.  Not only does Nellos have the great food the staff and owner treat you like the show \"Cheers\".  I went one time there and went again and Ryan after one time remember me also my order.  They treat you as family."}
{"text":"Nellos is by far my favorite pizza place. I just love the crust, the toppings, the overall taste, and the staff has always been great!"}
{"text":"We haven't been here for a while the food was good but our server was awful. ALEXANDRIA WAS AWFUL. We order a premium salad a pitcher of beer which we waited for the salad came after  a long wait and witin 5 minutes the pizza came and got cold while we ate the salad.  Very poor service.  And they weren't even busy."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT HOUSE SALAD AND THE HOUSE DRESSING IS SIMPLY OUTSTANDING. Bought a bottle to take home and bring back next visit to refill. 2 very large excellent cherry coke and Dr Pepper . Not the fake watered down kind. The real kind. 4 piece bruschetta egg plant appetizers very nice. 14\" pizza deluxe with everything. Fresh fresh ingredients with a layer of bottom and crunchy crust that is thin with a soft bread under the soft cheese. A lot better than the old UNOs and the ratings are on the money. Nice friendly service and take home for a second dinner. The small salad is large enough for 2 twice and the dressing from the bottle they brought out was large and unique and we poured out the whole bottle on the salad. Best salad yet in any restaurant with GRIMALDI'S medetterian salad in greenfield being almost equal. Very casual atmosphere"}
{"text":"We love nello's, always have. Now we usually go to other locations(mainly ahwatukee). We came here because we were on this side of town. Got us in right away, greeted us right away, got our drinks super quick. (Guess I should've given 4 stars or atleast 3 1/2 cus everything was great except a couple things. Our server was great! I guess the only thing that was their down fall was their lack of a kids menu, (which we really needed/wanted), and then when we got our pizza... We asked the difference between medium and large as far as slices go, he said 10 slices on both sizes. Except the slices are bigger on a large. So we order half Hawaiian; half green olives, black olives, and artichoke hearts (medium). We get our pizza, looks like only 6 slices... We would've ordered a large if we were only getting 6 with a medium. We were pretty hungry... Start divvying up the pizza, and instead of half and half, we get two pieces Hawaiian, 4 black&green olives and artichoke hearts. So instead of what I thought I was getting (5 Hawaiian slices, I get 2!!) HUGE LET DOWN!!! I was the one who talked my wife into coming here even tho it wasn't our normal location and they didn't have the dressing she likes(white balsamic), and yet I get screwed and only get two pieces of pizza I wanted(Hawaiian). 

So... Yea... Pretty big let down. Was really I the mood for a good nellos pizza, been coming to nellos for the past 15 years, hadn't been to this location in 10 years, but I had confidence in this place still... Looks like I was wrong..."}
{"text":"So if you haven't read my hubby's review yet, you need to!  That's right!  He credits me to finding this great eatery!  This is one of my favorite wings spots in town!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, but I encourage placing a to-go order rather than dining in.

It's like Chuck-E-Cheese. LOTS of screaming children, to the point where you decide to box your meal and finish it at home. Kinda stings when you pay for a meal and can't enjoy it at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I was disappointed based on personal recommendations and pictures and reviews here.  I was going to order the Pizza Bianca but the waitress recommended the Margherita.  That one sounded good also so I tried it.  I had the personal size and only ate 3 of the small slices.  I would have no desire to have it again.  Also got the house dressing on a side salad.  Both the dressing and the salad with croutons and huge carrot shavings were forgettable.  

Best part of the meal was the $2.75 O'douls beer."}
{"text":"Giant salads with fresh ingredients, bomb wings, and friendly service! Also offers gluten free crusts, which is a nice treat for me. A neighborhood favorite!"}
{"text":"My recent trip to this nello's was great! I ordered a medium pizza and a garden salad both of which were tasty and fresh! Our server Kyle was extremely nice and attentive. 

Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Thick crust, fresh toppings, great service! Delicious spinach salad, but super fatty and gross buffalo wings."}
{"text":"Busy Friday night sat within 20 minutes. Our server Michael was fantastic. Very prompt and attentive. Salad was super fresh. Caesar salad dressing was good. Pizzas came hot out of the oven. We will definitely be back soon. Love the remodel as well."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza joint I know of anywhere. I was out of the state for 2 years and as soon as I stepped off the plane I drove straight to Nello's. The pizza comes in deep dish or thin crust.  I prefer deep dish.  Their house dressing for the salad is amazing. You can buy a bottle to take home. For appetizers, try the pizza crust with pizza dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Super antipasto that comes with garlic bread, awesome pizza & service was great.
Will definitely be eating here again when I'm working in this part of Mesa."}
{"text":"Chicago pizza rocks!"}
{"text":"Nellos is a decent neighborhood pizza joint attempting to recreate a Chicago pizza parlor. This location is rather large and tucked into a strip mall. It has lots of TVs and memorabilia around to add to the flavor.

We had beer, wings, and deep dish pizza - standard fare. The wings seemed really fatty, but the honey hot sauce was really good. I was not impressed with the pizza. I had a deep dish with sausage and meatballs. The dough was good, but the sauce was too sweet and the meats lacked flavor. 

Fortunately, the service was great, and the prices were very reasonable. There are probably better options in the area, but it's hard to beat a good neighborhood pizzeria."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times to order the Buffalo chicken pizza which is simply amazing! We tried their regular pizza with pepperoni and green pepper and were seriously underwhelmed with the sauce flavor.

The other night, we ordered 2 large Buffalo chicken pizzas for the family, 1 large with pepperoni and green pepper and an antipasto salad. The total was $79!!!!! I about had a heart attack but I knew how good the Buffalo chicken pizza was and we were splitting the cost amongst multiple people. We were told 25 minutes so we showed up at exactly that time, only to get home and our pizza be cold, lacking toppings, and dry. It was some of the worst pizza I've had in a long time.

It was extremely disappointing considering how expensive the pizza was. My suggestion is to focus on their pizzas without their sauce and to eat it in the restaurant so that it is not cold... and overpriced."}
{"text":"I would just like to thank Jennifer from the Hotel for telling me about Arizona's take on Chicago style deep dish... This place was very good and I left full and thinking I should not have this pizza memory when it is so hot out... ;) It's 32 degrees in Chicago not a balmy 78.... Ehhh Whatever the pizza still rocked.


\"The Good\"
- The staff... our waiter played to the table and was able to feel comfortable and crack a few jokes and recommend a few beers... all of which were great calls. The best was when the meat laden pizza arrived and was introduced as the veggie pizza... our side of the table immediately object and told him it was the guys at the other end but when it landed on the table it was a beautiful sight :).
- Great beers on draft including a few local favorites that escape me at the moment... ask the wait staff, they know which ones move.
-Service was great for a busy Saturday night speed-wise as well. We were not waiting that long and the pizza arrived in two beers time.
- The pizza... Its really good. The kind of good that as I am writing this my mouth is watering remembering how delicious it was. I'm a fan...


\"The Meh\"
- Nothing really meh to comment on...


\"The Bad\"
- The fact I did not get a chance to try the Italian Beef ... but man did that look good as well."}
{"text":"Wow, amazing pizza. Saw this on check please and came for the chicago style. My wife and I had that and the thin crust also. I have to say we like both but I have to give the nod to the thin crust. It was bbq. The other was the skinny. The bbq thin was so great, especially when dipped in ranch, which my wife introduced me to today. This place is awesome. Really fast and efficient service. The ice tea is good. The is place is lively. We came at 4pm on Sat and it filed up by 5pm. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"On our way from the airport our SuperShuttle driver saw this place on the way to our destination and said Nello's is the best pizza place ever! We decided to check it out for ourselves and Nello's is not just the best pizza place ever But It is the best Italian food ever! The atmosphere is electric and service is great!  We absolutely loved it ! Will be back for sure the next time we are in town !"}
{"text":"Earlier this evening, I had an opportunity to sit down with some family at a well known \"Chicago\" pizza chain. And then someone asked if we had ever tried Nello's. I had never heard of this pizzeria but I am always willing to try a new restaurant. Even when they've been around for 33 years!

I've reviewed a few pizza joints recently and they were decent. None of them earned more than four stars because I knew there were places like Nello's out there. And it was only a matter of time until I found one worthy of five stars. And it didn't hurt that there was a Cubs game on.

Nello's is clearly more than a pizzeria, though. Just a glance at the menu will tell you that there are enough options to keep you happy if you want more than pizza. We started with the Mozzarella Platter which featured basil, tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and banana peppers, with toasted Italian bread and a side of olive oil with Parmesan cheese.... Amazing! This could be an appetizer at a fine dining Italian restaurant.

Our group couldn't decide on one or two large pizzas, so four, smaller customized pizzas were ordered. We all chose the pan style crust. This is a crust worthy of five stars without any toppings or sauce! For the record, I really like the pizza sauce here. It has a great tomato flavor with a heavy hint of garlic. And the Deluxe Combo is a solid choice because the Italian sausage used here is high quality stuff.

As I noted about the plethora of pizza joints popping up everywhere, this fad will come and go. But it's clear from one visit, that Nello's ain't going anywhere! Oh yeah... Cubs win! Cubs win!"}
{"text":"10 stars for the buffalo chicken pizza. Seriously could eat it every day. Service is always great."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious appetizers, pizza, and cold draft beer! Wait staff is friendly and on point. I always walk away feeling like I had a good thing for a good price."}
{"text":"How can this place have nearly five stars?  The atmosphere is fine if you're looking for a casual, family friendly kind of restaurant.  The service was fast and cordial, but the pizza left so much to be desired.  We ordered two pizzas.  One was a thin crust \"Deluxe Combo\" (pictured) which was passable, but nothing to write home about.  The other was a \"Pesto Bianca\" with chicken added (pictured) which I almost sent back --- and I never send food back.  The crust was burnt to a non-edible char; my teeth literally could not bite into it.  The chicken (which I paid extra to have!!!) was dry beyond belief.  It had a texture that made me think it was day-old chicken tossed onto a grill to merely reheat was had previously been overdone.  I was surprised that someone in the back-of-house allowed this pizza to leave the kitchen."}
{"text":"Average pizza joint. Our pizza crust was soggy which is a total bummer. The wings were good."}
{"text":"If you want pretty decent Chicago style pizza, then you need to come here. The ambiance is casual and the decor kind of old school which I like. The wine we ordered was named after someone very near and dear to my heart so of course we ordered it and it was middle of the road. Nothing terrible but nothing special. Then we started with the wings. The flavor was delicious but the execution seemed like they were boiled or something. Too soft for the way wings should be. No big though, just took them home. Then pizza was yummy! I was truly impressed with the crust! It was cooked to the ideal crispness and softness that a deep dish should be. The flavor profile was fantastic! I worked in a kitchen making pizza for a while so I know what is good. The cheese was stringy and hot like it should be and there were plenty of thinky sliced pepperoni just the way I like it. I'm not so sure the staff cares as much as the cooks but I enjoyed my time there."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots. Their pizza is great! Their salads are packed full of the good stuff, with the best house dressing around. The staff are very friendly and my favorite part is you are asked what you want to drink right away and don't forget the glasses are HUGE! There is nothing worse in restaurants than small glasses and the impossibility of getting a refill!

I have ordered many different kinds of pizza from this Nellos and have yet to be disappointed. The buffalo chicken pizza is so tasty and they will give you extra buffalo sauce and ranch all you have to do is ask. They will make you pizza any way you like it and the wait is never that long. I am always able to keep my lunch at an hour, which of course makes my boss happy!

Don't forget the salads that come piled high with meat, cheese and tons of veggies, you never feel you paid too much for a salad once you dig in! Their dressing is pinkish orange and just superb! 

In a part of town that is lacking great places to eat lunch, I am glad Nello's is in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The pizzas are great, but their salads are my favorite.  I love the antipasto salad with their house made dressing.  I have eaten here more times than I can count and will keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"Great deep dish pizza, great salads. Deep dish always hits the spot."}
{"text":"Everybody claims to know great pizza when they taste it. I'm no exception. Born and raised in New York, I've had the opportunity to try some really great pizza. And I've eaten pizza all over the country and even in Italy. 

Okay. Now that you know I'm an expert... Nello's serves up some really great pizza. I had a \"mini\" size with pepperoni, jalapeno, and anchovies. Perfectly done! Great flavor (although you might wonder how with anchovies). They have got really great pizza sauce as well. 

All I had was the pizza, so can't speak to other dishes they offer. But I heard no complaints from those around me, and the food I saw looked attractive and appetizing. Nello's has a very good staff (read attentive, quick, and friendly). I hate to say \"you can't go wrong\". But Nello's seems to be a great choice no matter how you slice it."}
{"text":"Love Nello's... Been going there since the late 80s/early 90s.  Crusts and sauce are a great appetizer or an inexpensive meal.  Deep dish pizza with pepperoni and sausage is fantastic.  Try the house dressing.  It's a local establishment with a small business feel.  Just remember closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"I tried Nello's out for the first time for lunch. 
I ordered a sausage, peppers and mushroom thin crust.  Great Pizza  great service and great prices.   I will be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and great service. Super friendly and a pleasure to dine out here! Don't forget to try the grilled wings!"}
{"text":"This is our fave family spot: dine-in and take-out! The service, the food and the friggin crust keeps us coming back over all these years. We can't tell you much about the menu bc we always get the Deluxe Chicago style pizza with the ever-so-amazing Garden Salad (add turkey & ham) with their house dressing that is to die for!"}
{"text":"The house dressing is an absolute must especially on the Old World Classic Salad. Bottles are available for purchase & I believe a dollar off is given for bringing the bottle back for refills. Servers are young and hip, my daughter used to say she wanted her first job to be here! Try the spinach pie, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this pizza.  This is my comparison place when I try other places and I'm still saying Nello's is better.  I've never had a bad pizza here.  Their thin crust pizza is the best and they don't overdo the sauce, so you can still taste the bread of the pizza. Of course the staff is always friendly. Bonus part is being able to have a good red wine here with the pizza. Yum."}
{"text":"The pizza at this place really lived up to all the hype I've been hearing and reading about. I thought they cooked it in some old school stone pizza oven with a fire burning but it was just toasted and cooked through a conveyor belt oven. Oh well, it was good either way. I thought it was going to be too upscale going in but nope, the ambience this place had was pretty casual. Just glad my first time wasn't a disappointment."}
{"text":"Pizza is good here but I really love the wings. I occasionally go here with coworkers during lunch. Service is generally fast even with a full crowd. Owner is very accomodating to my vegan friend."}
{"text":"Snowbird living in Tempe area for 3 months ....so many restaurants to choose from that it becomes difficult. Thus we appreciate Yelp; have mostly been happy with the reviews. We are \"clean\" eaters, so that is even more difficult to find. But back to Nello's ; their pizza is prepared with fresh ingredients and makes for a delicious piece of pie."}
{"text":"Nellos has slowly turned into my favorite neighborhood pizza place.  Both their thick and thin crust pizza is always delicious.  I tend to switch off depending on what I am in the mood for, or how hungry I am!  We usually always get the deluxe pizza, but recently have been more adventurous, trying the enchilada pizza and the Santa Fe pizza. Both were really good and a great change of pace if you are in the mood for pizza but want to mix it up a bit.  
Our service is always fabulous whether you are eating in or taking out.  Everyone is so friendly and it really feels like a restaurant where everyone knows each other and wants to make your dining experience a great one.  
Also, the house salad dressing is my favorite restaurant dressing of all time.  I always buy a bottle for home!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for deep dish pizza especially the Alaskan King pizza comes with crab of coarse and Bell peppers and other things I never get chance to find out because I'm to busy stuffing face with such great pie...service is fair and cleanliness as well prices join that group as well.. Over all best pizza in Chandler....so far anyway"}
{"text":"There should be a six or ten star option for Nello's.  This is the gold standard of pizza in Arizona for decades.  The other items - salads, sandwhiches, fries, cheese cake are all excellent with a good attention to detail by the chef's.   

Nello's can get busy, because it is good.  That's how it works, other people want good food too, but they don't short change quality on take out!"}
{"text":"This is first on my top 3 pizza places in Arizona! Great service, great pizza! I'm a big fan of the Deluxe Combo on wheat crust. We also regularly get pepperoni on thin white crust as well. Salads are good. The famous house dressing is a favorite of my kids. Do you pay a bit more? Sure. Is it packed almost every day? Yep. Do you have to wait sometimes (while enjoying a beer)? Indeed. Is it worth it? Absolutely!!!"}
{"text":"I like their pizza a lot. They actually cooked the pizza and didn't just let the cheese melt and call it done. And they cut it in squares which I prefer over triangle slices. Most importantly it tasted good! Better than Geno's for sure"}
{"text":"This place is as good as I'd heard.  We came here for a day-late birthday dinner for my middle daughter/Father's Day dinner for her husband.  She and his six-year old daughter ordered a Hawaiian style with pineapple and ham, he and I  got the Margherita Pizza with garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, fresh basil, mozzarella, and romano cheese.  Both were so delicious!  He also got some chicken wings which were tender and juicy and not spicy at all, dipped in either of two great sauces, ranch or marinara.  The pizza's were about $13 each for the larges.  I usually have no problem quitting after two slices but the  flavor squishing around in my mouth was so good I couldn't resist taking a third piece at this place. 

The decor was pretty and the service was great--the server checked back several times to see if we were doing okay or needed anything.

 I would definitely be a regular if I lived near here.  


On a side note, next door is the Aloha Kitchen which we had eaten at about a week ago and was also very good!

{"text":"My husband and I love Nello's pizza! Not only is the pizza wonderful but well, I'm a big salad person. I love the fact that you can actually take home the salad dressing you had eatten that night on your salad. Everytime we go there I always pick up a bottle of their house salad dressing- it's so good! 

I just wish they would deliever- if they did deliever all the other pizza places we use would go to waysid and mind you, in this house we are very picky about pizza."}
{"text":"This place had some great pizza. Staff was friendly and service was great. Tried a mushroom pepperoni pizza on original crust. The pizza was tasty. My only draw back on the pizza was the crust. Seemed really dry for deep dish. I'm used to a buttery flaky crust. This was almost cracker consistency. If I didn't eat the crush, then it would be the perfect pizza.  Will most likely be back. I honestly didn't even know this place existed or I would have tried it sooner."}
{"text":"Still an excellent experience! I had not been there in a while, but I was on my way home and decided to stop for take-out. I ordered a house salad with chicken. The large portion easily fed two, the chicken was moist and well seasoned, and the house salad dressing is a Thousand Island-y sort of thing that is really good. I'll have to get back soon to re-try the pizza.

It is good to see places that maintain their quality standards over time."}
{"text":"You want to know how you know a thin crust pizza is going to be good? When they slice it in squares and serve it on paper on top of the pan. I ordered a med, thin crust with meatballs, pepperoni and basil. It had the exact amount a grease under it, just enough to make your hands greasy, but not the crust. we also ordered the bread, mozz and basil appetizer. I had to announce I couldn't eat anymore because I wanted to save room for my pizza. Nevermind, I ate more of it than I should, because I couldn't stop. It comes with an OO mixture of parm and garlic. Who does that? Ummmmm people who know what's good, That's who. The prices are perfect. If you are that person who has to review if your meal was worth your money, then go here and review that is worth your money. Or  just go because the food is THAT good. it's super casual, like shorts and flip flops. its kid friendly and the wait staff is friendly, prompt and all seem to really enjoy their jobs. when we were leaving. we found someone's credit card in the parking lot. My husband ran back in and gave it to the wait staff that was rolling silverware. I hope the people who lost it really trace their steps and get it back. That's a terrible feeling."}
{"text":"I havebeen eating at Nello's proabably for 17 years or so and I have to say that I am a pizza fan and think that they have THE BEST CRUST I HAVE EVER TASTED!!!! Also their spinach salad is to die for...they make all of their own salad dressings and their pesto bianca pizza with sausage and mushrooms is my all time fav!!!!"}
{"text":"I moved to the area recently. Just driving by Nello's, I could smell the delicious-ness...which is PIZZA! I had to stop in and grab a take out pizza. I was not disappointed! It tastes just as good as it smelt! Will be back soon for some more!"}
{"text":"Nello's you never do me wrong. Your pizza is tasty, your Italian Beef is delicious, your appetizers are on target; I only wish I could say something about dessert, but I'm always too full to try! 

Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"The Good:  Great, friendly service with a smile and laid back atmosphere.

The Bad:  The crust was not all that I thought it would be. Instead of being dense and buttery, it was really light and fluffy. Not what I was expecting from a deep dish crust. Normally eating 1 or 2 slices of Chicago deep dish is enough to make you throw in the towel but I ate 4 slices and ehh, not so much stuffed. The sauce was awesome however.

The Ugly:  Spinach on pizza was undercooked and slimy. Probably just a fluke this time but still off-putting. If you are looking to listen to loud tv's and drink, go to Native New Yorker. Several people found this out the hard way that they can't turn the volume up louder after ordering 5 pitchers of beer, only to give it away for free to people sitting behind them so they could leave for Native."}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza here is the best I've had in the valley. The thick or deep dish is just okay it doesn't really do it for me to say the least. But boy are the flavors there when you order the thin crust.  We always used to come here on Tuesdays to get the Tuesday take out special which apparently stopped. When we called today to go get the usual Tuesday deal to us the dead give away was when the man over the phone had asked us what kind of large soda we would like and when my boyfriend had asked if he meant to say 2 liter he said no. So now that they have taken away my Tuesday special I can tell you at this moment that the chances of us going to nellos after this are slim to none.

I'm severely disappointed that they have no specials anymore but nothing lasts forever I guess. I will miss you nellos very much I will but I guess we will be sticking closer to home and trying out pizza on 87....sigh.... :("}
{"text":"Came in for cheesecake and wine, and had to try the wings. OMG, seriously the best wings! Baked extra long and the parm cheese melted on them all toasty and crispy really topped it off! I will be back! Need to try the eggplant parm and homemade sausage next! Pizza also looks amazing! Great service with Zach at the bar! Good times!"}
{"text":"Just so we can get this straight; this is the ORIGINAL Nello's.  The others are franchised and they really just can't hold a candle to this location.  After a series of bad experiences at the location at McClintock and Southern, the hubby and I made the trek to this location, hoping for a better outcome.  We were immediately greeted and took our seats at the bar.  The bartender got us drinks right away and was very quick and extremely friendly throughout our entire meal.  The owner, Brian came over and talked to us and was very friendly talking to all the other patrons.  They either have a ton of regulars, or the people that work here are just super friendly.  The salad and pizza were just as I had remembered them to be.  They were cooked and served properly and quickly.  This is the location we will be frequenting from now on!"}
{"text":"It's sort of amazing this place stays in business. We haven't been there for at least 10 years, and recently decided to try it again. Waste of money. Everything was bland; from the french fries to the pizza. The food looked great, but was mostly tasteless. We had two pizzas - the pesto-white and a regular sausage - french fries and garlic bread. The fries were undercooked and flavorless (how can you screw up fries this bad?). The bread was toasted well and looked like it had garlic butter on it, but again, bland. The sausage had an odd taste to it and the pizza sauce was, again, bland. Overall, this was a very unsatisfying experience."}
{"text":"This place has really good pizza but their \"deep dish\" is definitely not Chicago-style deep dish.

I really wanted Chicago-style (sauce on top) but wasn't disappointed by Nello's.  It's pretty inexpensive and actually good.  The crust is also really yum.  I got the Murphy's and loved the bacon and onion combo... Bacon strips on pizza are difficult to eat but totally worth it.  

Definitely give Nello's a try but know it's not Chicago-style."}
{"text":"Okay, full disclosure: I do not love their thick-crust pizza, even though that's what they're known for. It's okay; it's just not my favorite. But I absolutely adore their thin-crust pizza. It is my favorite anywhere. And now I have another disclosure: I always get ham and pineapple. Yes, I am one of those people. But it is amazing, and I am not ashamed to admit it. (Pineapple goes with everything.) So now you can mock me at will. But I will find you ... and dump pineapple all over your next pizza. And you will love me for it. In the end. 

The gist: Go here, get the thin crust, and get the Hawaiian if you want an epic experience. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Finally a great pizza place!!! My family recently moved here from Chicago and we have had the worst luck with pizza joints in the area. We have had food poison from Pizza on 87th that place is a dump. Rosati's pizza is fresh but greasy as heck. We met an awesome married couple that live in the area and they told us about Nello's. Omg!! We ordered thin crust pizza it was so light, fresh and tasty!! My family loves pizza and this place sure gave us a great memory of our hometown Chicago pizza. Job well done!!!! This is and will be our go to pizza place. I can definitely say the reviews for this place are very real unlike the duped reviews from Pizza on 87th. I try not to get over emotional but Pizza on 87th had my daughter so sick it is crazy. So for her to really enjoy her pizza and have no issues after eating Nello's put a huge smile on my face. We love it!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place for their food and service. The strawberry salad is amazing and the house dressing is worth the trip alone. They have a cutesty birthday dessert too if you're looking to celebrate."}
{"text":"So I will start this off with I don't like pizza at all!

But Nellos make the best that I have ever tried. I live right around the corner from this place and have always wondered why it was packed well now I know.  If you have an opportunity to visit this place you really should I doubt you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"They accommodated our big group in the separate dining area to the right of the arcade once you first enter. My friends have raved bout this joint and wanted to try it out. Upon entering the place, you would think it's one of the smaller chain restaurants with greasy pizza (barros). But the food actually surprised me here. 

Got the old world salad which was filled with all kinds of goodies like feta cheese, olives, red onioin, peppercinis, roasted peppers, cucumber, etc. I think the best part of the salad was their tomato house dressing which is phenomenal. It has a tangy balsamic taste to it which is awesome with any salad I would imagine. Maybe even dip ur pizza in it.

Next time I gotta try some of their pizzas though and I will report back!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. We always come here whenever we crave pizza or Italian food. Their Alaskan King Crab pizza is to die for. They are sooo good. And their appetizers are great as well. The atmosphere around here is nice as well. They have good seating and also a bar too if you'd like to drink."}
{"text":"Owner is the real deal - love that guy and his passion shows in the great food. Turkey sandwich, pizza and cold salad with their special dressing is world class just like their management"}
{"text":"12/7/14
My first time at nello's... I had the italian beef sandwich and my fiance had the pizza with pepperoni.
I'm  a ny pizza purist so the deep dish style really does not do it for me but my italian beef was great. The pizza tasted very fresh with fresh ingredients.
We also had the bread with melted cheese appetizer which was also great.
Nello's bread is fantastic......thats the first sign that you're in for some good food.

I will return....."}
{"text":"Rude staff. Terrible service. Pizza was overcooked. Waited an hour to be seated. Not recommended. The hostess wanted to seat us outside due to larger parties, its raining and 50 degrees outside. Waste of time, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Came across  this place while on our way to Panda Express. Must say this is up in my top 3 for pizza places! Our server Rachel was so kind and helpful! And made the experience even better! Might be back tonight for dinner :D"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! It's been so long since I've had Nellos that I forgot how amazing it is. We sat at the bar &was helped by the owner, who's SO friendly and kind. The salad & pizza are just so amazing. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Always love coming to this location. Good service. Great pizza. I'm  crust lover and everything I've tried is great. I'm definitely a fan of the sausage there. I'm quite the pizza lover and there are a lot of let downs in the valley. This one has never let me down! Thank you Nellos"}
{"text":"This is a go to staple for us. The staff is always friendly. Service always good and the pizza is awesome. However I go there for the Old World Classic salad. It's to die for with the house dressing. Mmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and we always enjoy the food.  They have bar seating and it's a medium size location with outdoor seating, when the season is right.  Always busy, but they have great deep dish pizza.  Unlike most deep dish, that can be too greasy/buttery (never thought I would say that), it still a very tasty crust.  We always have the 12\" deep dish combo and the large garden salad with their house dressing (which is available for purchase, if you'd like).  Tonight service was above and beyond what we have experienced before.  Our server (Ryan) was not only nice, but quick, attentive and packaged our leftovers.  We have never experienced that before here, that is why the experience was above and beyond, especially as busy as they are and can get.  Thank for the exceptional service tonight."}
{"text":"Great food + Horrible service= Never coming back! (Deserves NO stars but was unable to leave a review without a star Nellos does not deserve for their service)"}
{"text":"Our first time trying Nello's..
We are hooked!
The food is delicious, we ordered the deep dish pizza, garlic cheese bread and salad with their house made dressing ( which is fabulous)!
Our server Joshua was so attentive and helpful with his suggestions.. Awesome service...."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go get pizza the staff is always nice and it's always quick good service. And the pizza is some of the best pizza I have had. I would definitely recommend going here if you like pizza."}
{"text":"Wow Nello's is everything people say it is. I was amazed I'll tasty their pizzas where I'm from back east and it doesn't get any better than this. The service was awesome the atmosphere was very casual and comfortable and all the staff seemed to be on the ball with whatever they did so I highly recommend this place if you want to get the best pizza in the valley"}
{"text":"Well, I ordered a cheese-less pizza, and I didn't get cheese. I also didn't get any sauce. What I got was bread, with pepperoni and black olives. The bread was crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside, which awarded the second star. The toppings simply slid off the pizza. At least the pepperonis were crispy. I wouldn't be so critical, but I said I wanted a pizza, no cheese, with pepperoni and black olive and pizza sauce, to which the employee replied that sauce is a given. Apparently, it's not a given. The other pizza ordered, with cheese, pepperoni, sausage, and green bell peppers, also had very little sauce. Double bummer.  Don't think I'll be ordering here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite tried it for the first time in an office meeting nobody had ever had it and we will be having their pizza from now on 25 employees and we all loved it"}
{"text":"All I had was a pepperoni and pineapple pizza and hands down it was the best pizza I have ever had in the Phoenix area.   The crust was light and just flat out tasted amazing.  I wish it was closer to me in Queen Creek.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out.  The whole group loved their pizza too.  Agreed it was some of the best they have had in the area."}
{"text":"As usual, my experience at Nello's was a great one!  If your a fan of deep dish, this is the place to go in AZ.   I've been a frequent visitor over the last 20 years, and as usual,  they did not disappoint.  

First, Its great to see that they have Four Peaks on tap, I had a Hop Knot IPA.  My wife and I then ordered the 1/2 Spring Salad with the both the House Balsamic Vinaigrette AND the regular House, since they are both  some of our favorite dressings from anywhere.  Then we ordered the Eggplant Brochette for an appetizer, the first time trying that item.  The Brochette had plenty of cheese and eggplant, but it had a soggy feel to it, almost as if the bread hadn't been toasted enough, and gave it more of a cheese bread taste and texture.  

Then I had the 10in Skinny, which was the shinning star of the night.  It had every meat on the menu, and the cheese was piled on heavy.  The bacon was thick and cut into quarter strips, sausage had a great flavor, and their sauce and always thick and soft deep dish crust was excellent.  Truly one of the best deep dish pizza's i've had.

Our waiter Zach was extremity efficient and nice,  The place was packed, but he didn't seem fazed by it at all and he gave us great service the whole night.  We will defiantly be back soon."}
{"text":"Moved to this neighborhood ten years ago and was so happy to have a local family owned pizza shop and restaurant so close to home. After ten years still the best."}
{"text":"Been enjoying Nello's for over 30 years now and am still their biggest fan! Food-delicious. Ambience-fantastic. People-absolute best. I have eaten all over the world and am still impressed every time I come in. New dish for me-Margarita Pizza with sausage. Excellent."}
{"text":"If you desire true Chicago deep dish pizza, then Nello's should be at the top of your list! This is a staple pizza location in the Valley- and my family has been going for years. Nello's offers a great menu, drink list, and atmosphere. They offer an excellent Mon-Fri lunch special - a large drink, salad and 2-topping personal pizza for $8.99- what a steal! Don't pass this place up, it's worth it."}
{"text":"We ate at Nello's last night and it was bomb! We had the Old World salad with house dressing and the pesto Bianca pizza with sausage. BEST part about the whole thing was our server- Joshua. Ask for him!!! He was on it all night, great recommendations- there exactly when we needed him, told us to get the smaller salad (and we were so glad!) and was just super helpful and chill. He even put an extra container of house dressing in our to-go box when we hadn't asked. Just above and beyond. We sat there talking about how he was the best server we'd had in a long time!"}
{"text":"PIZZA HEAVEN

My favorite is to get a pepperoni and sausage.  They make their sausage there, and it's delicately seasoned.  The sauce has a good amount of garlic in it, and herbs, and it is wonderful beyond words.  Best deep dish pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"The house italian dressing is so good I'm tempted to drink it. I get a salad every time because of it. I drizzle it on my pizza too.... I have a problem..."}
{"text":"NOT A FAN, they claim this is a Chicago type Pizza (NO) is my response.  The atmosphere is pretty friendly - great neighborhood pizza joint.  Wait staff very friendly, but the Pizza (hand tossed or their original crust) not so good, the sauce was tasteless not very italian (bland) to be exact, the sausage was very overdone or dry.

Might go back definitely won't get their pizza may try a italian sandwich???? We'll see
I'll let you know !!"}
{"text":"Ate here many, many months ago.  A favorite pizza place for Mom and me!!  She absolutely ADORES the spinach pie, while I enjoy it and many other varieties, including the Margherita and Alaskan (white sauce, seafood).  I really appreciate the fact that whole-wheat pizza crusts are available!  Wish more establishments would offer alternative options, such as whole-wheat and gluten-free for those w/ food allergies and issues...

If thin-crust pizzas rock your boat, like they do mine, then check out Nello's!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Nellos Mesa for a long time now and am always happy with the food, the environment, and of course the Owner Brian and the rest of the awesome Nello's employees :-)) But I do have to say I have always been a plain thin crust margarita pizza fan until I had the Deluxe Combo original crust pizza tonight.... AMAZING!!! So delicious and made with perfection!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place. They are the real deal. Service is always great & it's never too busy. As for the food I know you want to know about the pizza. The crust is perfect the perfect ratio of crunch & chew. My favorite is the Mt. Veggie, which is saying something as I'm typically not a veggie pizza person. Any other time I'm a pepperoni & jalapeño (or olive) kinda girl, maybe Hawaiian. There's just something about the little caverns of cheese the veggies make, meanwhile the veggies come out hearty & flavor truly worthy of being on a pizza. However, the real treat here is something totally unexpected for a pizza joint, the salads. The secret is the house dressing which, honestly, if it wasn't frowned upon, I might just drink. It's that good. You can even get this sun dried tomato spiked treat by the bottle to take home."}
{"text":"If you are s pizza fan, I must tell you that Nellos is the best pizza in the valley by far! Love it so much we order enough for leftovers everytime we go! If you want great pizza, great service And a clean place to eat, try Nellos!"}
{"text":"I undersold this place in my earlier review. It's the best. Period. I've received the same quality food every visit. The same staff is always friendly and smiling. They even throw an old paratrooper a military discount (played a hunch they're proudly displaying our flag in the entrance). And please tip and respect your server! *that wonderful meatball sub you're about to eat may have been made by a veteran chopper punk* grab a slice and I highly recommend the meatball sandwich. It rocks!"}
{"text":"Food and service at Nellos is pretty good. Portions are a good size and the bread they give you to start the meal is delish!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever tried! The crust is super delicious. And their wings are on point, not too dry not to juicy. Def will be ordering take out from here!"}
{"text":"Since I've moved to AZ in the 90s my family has become familiar with Nello's in Scottsdale. Recently they have closed that Scottsdale location and the Tempe one we also visited. I've been to this Mesa location a few times and I LOVE IT. Most recently we ordered a pitcher of Miller Lite and for some reason, it was the best Miller Lite draft I've ever had in a restaurant! The pizza has always been great and Mesa's cannot be beat. Nice neighborhood-like atmosphere, yet the parking lot is small and run down. Not much you can do about it though. I'm really hoping Nello's stays open in Mesa for a very long time. MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"So this is probably the best pizza I've ever had!!! We ordered the Skinny and the BBQ Chicken, so freaking good.  Although, idk that I would call it Chicago style, having had Giordano's, but it's definitely good.  Looking to go back!"}
{"text":"Personally not my style. People recommended this place to me, so went on a whim. Service was subpar, food was subpar, just not a good showing at all. I wouldn't go back. No one in my family enjoyed it, but a lot of our friends rave about it and love it. Maybe its a personal choice but not where I would go."}
{"text":"Maybe I just don't get it, but I really don't think this is the greatest pizza in the world. Not even top 5. It's good stuff and I support local businesses so I'd visit again, but it's not my top choice."}
{"text":"Nello's Pizza is like home, the food is amazing and homemade. My favorite pizza for 30 years hands down.You can really tell how much effort goes into the tiniest details and how much they care. My favorites include the Deluxe Combo pizza, the Old World Classic Salad with the house dressing, and the eggplant bruschetta ..it still shocks me how generous they are with the toppings. Everything is like that..huge portions and super friendly service at a reasonable price..no wonder they are so busy!! Over the top."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is amazing. It's hard to choose just one pizza so we usually order 2 or 3 small ones and all share! The service is fantastic and we always leave more than satisfied. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Last night our family went to Nello's for a graduation ceremony celebration. I had not been to Nello's in over 20 years, but it was just as fantastic as I remember. Not only was the pizza fantastic so was the customer service. We had a group of seven and the server was friendly, served us quickly and with ease and made us feel right at home. Not one person in our party wasn't blown over by the pizza and only two of us had a previous experience with Nello's. It was a great night and going to Nello's made it even better."}
{"text":"This is the best Chicago style pizza in Phoenix! My family has been going to Nello's for the past 30 years! The original style crust is wonderfully golden and crisp! Our favorite pizza is pepperoni and sausage! The sausage is delicious and made every day! Our favorite salad is the Old World Classic with the delicious House Dressing! The dressing is a spicy Italian style, but it is so good I buy some bottles to go. It's also great for dipping the pizza in! 

The place is the BEST! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is my go to pizza place. They may cost a little more than your commercial joint, but the flavor makes up for it. Great sauce and crust they have won a customer for life in my eyes."}
{"text":"Whenever we come out to Arizona to visit friends, my wife and I make it a point to visit Nello's at least once while we're out there. Why? Because it's darn good, that's why! 

Nello's signature style pizza is this neat little hybrid of a pan and a thin crust. It's thin and crispy through and through, yet still has enough density to hold its own when the toppings start piling on. Yeah, it's a little different, but that's why it's so special. My suggestion is to get the Pizza Bianca, something about it and it's sauce-less, garlic-y, cheesiness just makes my happy.

Let's not forget about their house dressing either. If I could somehow get it to survive with me on the 6+ hour drive back home with me to California, I would bring it home by the case. It's hard to describe, but it compliments a house salad oh so beautifully.

So, why only four stars?! Well, I've listed everything about Nello's that is worth mentioning. Everything else on the menu is sort of ho-hum. The wings and other sides lack texture and, more importantly, flavor. Stick to the pizza, salad, and of course, the beer on tap."}
{"text":"I thought the thin crust pizza was pretty good, but not the best I've had. My husband ordered a deep dish and it was awful.  All bread and practically no toppings.  They are also pretty expensive.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"Great pizza even better service! Andrew Clarke and Michael Hitzel always take amazing care of us when we come in to eat and the kitchen and floor managers Rio and Jimmy always make sure our service and food are exceptional!"}
{"text":"OMG. Love Nello's. I have not been there in YEARS so went a few weeks ago and WOW. I like lots of cheese and you get it at Nello's. The sausage pizza was great and I hear they make it themselves. Cheap wine and beer as well. The place was crazy crowded...and we still got a seat right away. Great waiter and very friendly. Great local place and no wonder they have been open for so many years! :)"}
{"text":"Overall this place wasn't bad.. We ordered garlic bread, hot wings and pizza. Their garlic bread was just ordinary nothing special about it and pizza was okay.. My boyfriend who has been here before said their pizza was a little off than usual.. Their wings was good though not your Long Wong wings but I probably enjoyed the wings more than the pizza.. I don't know if they just had an off day or what.. But it seemed like they had a lot of regulars, the waitress seemed to know few customers by their name.."}
{"text":"The pizza here has been top notch and full of flavor ..I've never been disappointed here even when it's crowded ..the service has been great as well ..the salads are really good as well .."}
{"text":"Nellos Pizza Mesa is the best! Their portions are huge, all the ingredients are made fresh daily including the delicious crust, and the staff is always very friendly! A few of my favorites include the triple baked Garlic Parmesan wings, the Asian Chicken Salad, original crust Skinny pizza (loaded with meat) , and of course the cookie pie!! They also have a very delicious House dressing, I highly recommend, we take a bottle home for our salads and we even marinate our chicken in it, it's amazing!! I saw a few reviews on here complaining about the prices but I thought their prices were more than fair considering the portion sizes and amount of toppings. The food also comes out in a very timely manner and the atmosphere makes you feel right at home! If you are looking for a family-friendly, scratch kitchen style of food, with reasonable prices this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"I don't get it.  To be fair, I've only had their pizza, while eatable, I would never go back. Its definitely a huge jump up from the Domino's & Pizza Huts but not even close to a Spinato's Pizza (my favorite) or a Casanova Brothers Pizza, as far as chains go, I think NYPD is much better than this.  I know I'm in the minority here & I love pizza but just not Nello's."}
{"text":"The pizza was good but nothing special. It took over 40 minuets to get our pizza. The servers were friendly though. Overall, if your not willing to wait a while for pizza that isn't something special, I wouldn't recommend it. But if your in the area and you don't mind the wait, then definently check it out."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas in the valley. Especially if you are looking for a thin crust pizza.  The half baked cookie Sunday is also to die for."}
{"text":"This is the first pizza place where I haven't eaten the pizza. My visits usually consist of the spring salad with their made-in-house dressing and either a sandwich or pasta. Every sandwich is excellent and filling no matter which you choose.

The atmosphere is excellent with sports on in the backround and this Nello's location has the friendliest wait staff out of all of them."}
{"text":"Dear Nello's, 

I love you. You may think I am moving too fast as I just met you last week, but I have never been so sure of my emotions. Every bite filled me with happiness. Each slice of your pizza was a flavorful perfection. I love how you give me the choice of getting a wheat crust. There are so many flavors I want to try. The spinach pie will always remind me of our first encounter though. Your pizzas are affordable and amazing. One of the best I have ever had in my life. You beat pizza in Italy. Sorry Italy."}
{"text":"I've been eating Nello's since my childhood and I get hungry every time i think about eating there. Recently bought a house in the area and we joke that we did it just so we were around the corner from the restaurant. I love the salad, house dressing, sandwiches and original crust pizza. You seriously can't go wrong with anything on the menu and the service is always great."}
{"text":"Top notch pizza!! Need good pizza and beer, stop here. Stopped by on a recommendation of a friend, on national pizza day. Surprise got seated right away. Atmosphere is kinda barish but not overly. I like they have several craft local beers!! Had Italian bread as an appetizer came with an olive oil dip, very good. Went with a thin skinny, which is loaded with meat and strips server recommend extra crispy for doneness and he made the perfect call!. Will be a good go to for here on. You need this pizza in your life!!"}
{"text":"Nello's is great, I've eaten pizza from all over the country and can honestly say this is great pizza. We usually go there for Pizza every sunday afternoon. They claim Chicago style, the thick wheat crust emulates that. The quality of ingredients are amazing, I usually order a Chicken-Bacon-Pepperoni combo, which is always awesome. My wife always gets their Turkey-Avocado sub with extra house dressing. The house dressing is amazing and worth pouring all over a sandwich or salad.

Every one of there locations has a nice midwestern pizzeria feel, growing up outside Detroit, one thing I miss is an old-school pizzeria. The bonus is that they carry local brew from Four Peaks on tap and always stay seasonal, and for a \"beer snob\" like me that's worth giving 5-stars!"}
{"text":"Friendly servers, accommodating cooks, clean and nice atmosphere, delicious food makes this a must visit restaurant. The pizza is made extremely well and tastes fresh. The lasagna is meaty, cheesy and delicious. The cookie with ice cream dessert is tasty as it's not hard but not too gooey."}
{"text":"Nello's Pizza is fab. Just mother-loving fabulous. My mom and I came here on a whim on a weekend night because we suddenly were hungry for pizza. The wait was not bad as expected. We split a small [biiiiig small] salad and a small thin-crust pizza with enough leftovers of both for my brother. Our server was super nice, but kind of spacy. I don't want to deduct anything from my review about him - maybe he had too many tables or was new, I'm not sure. Our salad came out quite quickly, but then it took forever for the pizza, so it was hard to maintain self-control over the salad while waiting. Hands down some of the best food I've had during my Valley visits over the years!"}
{"text":"Reminiscent of Midwest pizza. Liking both the thin and thick crust and the Italian Beef sandwich is very nice! I also am a fan of the Kiltlifter beer they have on tap. Comfortable place to meet friends and have a couple brewskis!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever... Not an expensive price either. Get the original deep crust!!! Great service too."}
{"text":"This must be a fairly good time if you're a regular. There is a substantial crowd that's obviously having a ball, very friendly. But for an occasional customer we have twice now been completely unimpressed with the service. Once we were seated after a regular couple who came in behind us and tonight felt fairly ignored at a party. Two thin crust pizzas were both cooked well with nice crust but little flavor. They do have a good local beer selection and a good salad (Strawberry and walnut). But the service is remarkably terrible. We had to ask for water and twice to get more napkins. It took a good 15  min to bring uninspired wings and the salad and both were long gone another 15 min or more before the pizza arrived. That was 10 min after Zack told us two min. which was only after we flagged him down to enquire about the delay. Having watched two tables of regulars get there's before us the question begged asking.  Afterall, we had been seated well before them both.  For an explaination we were told that thin crust just takes longer. Upon request, Zack took away some of the dirty dishes. OK. Whatever."}
{"text":"I've always liked Nellos. My boyfriend loves it so it's always been one of those places we go to regularly. The service is always good. My favorite is their BBQ chicken pizza and the skinny. I occasionally treat myself to an Italian soda as well which are also really tasty. Just recently I went there after one of my art shows with a group of people. I called ahead to let them know we were coming and when we got there the table was set up and ready to go. The service was good, we made it easy by ordering pitchers of beer and a few large pizzas. The server did a great job by getting the dirty plates off our table when we were finished. We wanted to sit and drink more, and I personally can't stand it when dirty plates just sit there. We ended up ordering a few more pitchers and staying longer. All in all it was a pleasant evening. I'll be suggesting this place for it's great pizza, good service, and It's good accommodations for bigger parties."}
{"text":"Great place, pizza and environment! I was surprised that I walked into a pizza place and waited to be seated. But it was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Came in on a busy day, and thought to sit at the 2 Tables between the bar and the order pick up window... 

I did not realize this means no service area, as all waiters n even the hostess didnt look at us, or ask us if we could be helped,,, Maybe they assumed we were waiting for a pickup order... 

Well thats about 60 buck that walked out the door.. Hope that gets communicated so someone is responsible for those 2 tables.. I went for lunch one day with my friend and we had to kind of be rude to get service there,, thought it would be addressed after that, but i guess not..."}
{"text":"Okay let me start off by saying that Nellos has THE BOMB pizza. I mean, explosively good pizza. It changed my life. I started giving back to the community, I read the bible more, heck, I even help elderly people put stuff in their cars! But a dark time came when I ordered something other than the pizza....the lasagna. I would tell people far and wide how amazing the pizza was, and lo and behold I was let down by the lasagna. I'm a fraud now. It was some sort of weird microwave creation that had veggies that don't belong in a saucy Italian delicacy and my trust was broken. Unless you have found your life changing meal at Nellos, I suggest you stick to the pizza..."}
{"text":"I came in with my girlfriend on a Friday night.  I would say there were about 60% tables filled.  We arrived at 8:41pm and sat at our table for about 15 minutes without anyone coming to take our drink order.  Now in this 15 minutes we witnessed 2 waiters working their asses off and 6 staff members standing around at the bar.  One bar tender that was speaking with a waitress and literally didn't take a break from their conversation for that whole time.  3 team members were folding silverware this whole time.  Now I love having silverware but this delegation of team member efforts was a little on the silly side.  We finally had to go see the hostess to get any type of service.  When this person came to our table all we got was a \"sorry they switched our tables and didn't tell anyone\". I hate to leave two stars cause I love the food here but honestly this may be the last time we visit this establishment."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Nello's and am so happy I did.  Laura A. called and said she was craving pizza and since I'm the pizza addict anytime this rare occasion happens I am down in a heartbeat to go.  So since she lives in Mesa we decided to check out Nello's as the reviews were all top notch.  

Upon arrival we were greated and we said we were ordering a to go order so we were shown the to go window.  Brian greeted us there after giving us a brief minute to scope out the wonderful menu.  We decided to get two 10\" pies to get a good trial run at this place.  He was very nice and gave us some ideas and we went with The Murphy which has strips of bacon and onions on it and I got a custom pie with sun dried tomato's, gouda cheese, and green peppers.  

When we got home we devoured both pies the sauce was great and we had one deep dish and one thin crust.  I preferred the deep dish but they both were great.  

I will for sure be back for more pizza and to try their sandwich's as they sounded very good as well.  The service was great everyone was very nice it felt like a great neighborhood restaurant.  I think that feeling at a lot of restaurants has been lost today so it was very nice.

{"text":"went back and hung out at the bar and enjoyed some craft beer while waiting for pizzas we ordered to take home. I absolutely love Nellos even more than my first encounter. The people here are super friendly and there are a lot of regulars. They just make you feel so welcome. Tried the eggplant brochette while we waited for our custom ordered pizzas and the brushetta is ummm how can i explain it..great? Marvelous, splendid? Superfreakingdelish? yup superfreakingdelish works.."}
{"text":"I ordered take out and it was very good.  Ready when they said it would be.  Staff was friendly, and the pizza was great!  I would certainly go back!  It was a Friday night, so it was pretty busy, but I was helped right away."}
{"text":"As always, Nello's is consistent. Went here and ordered from here on many occasions. The more you come in the better the service gets, only had one kind of terrible experience and the manager made up for it. All the ingredients taste fresh - extra toppings, you get what you pay for - hard to say that about anyone else that is close. 

Bartender's and server's are friendly and speedy. Don't wait if something is incorrect, they are usually 'moving' and you might not get one right away."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since I was a kid. This is hands down the best deep dish pizza in the valley!

If you like bbq chicken pizza, Nellos has the best there is! Even though the bbq is excellent, the rest of their food is excellent as well."}
{"text":"We have been going to Nellos for years. Last night the hubby and I went for date night.  We started off with the Eggplant \"brushetta\" .  The toppings were heavy and the bread soggy. While tasty it was definitely NOT brushetta worthy.  Rename it to Eggplant Cheesy Bread and then you will get what you expect.  We also ordered the Spring salad with the house Balsamic. It was delicious!!  Nellos makes the best house dressing and this was equally as yummy as the original. We each order our own pizza. Hubby loved his pan crust Skinny. I being a creature of habit ordered what I ALWAYS get, the thin crust wheat spinach pie.  Here is why I only gave three stars... I think they must have a new chef. The pizza was soggy and I had to get a magnify glass out to find any feta... Oh no!! The main ingredient I was craving!  :( I voiced my complaint to our very attentive and friendly waiter Zach.  He had them make another. I requested it To Go  as by then hubby had finished his meal. Unfortunately the second pizza was the same as the first.  I will probably go back because the salads are just so wonderful but unfortunately my favorite pizza is no longer an option I will take a risk on again.  So disappointed after craving it all day!"}
{"text":"Really expensive and not very good my pizza was really under cooked and I got really sick from it. Im sorry nellos I will not be back"}
{"text":"My wife and I was looking for somewhere to eat dinner when I mentioned we had not been to nello's in several years.  We decided to give it a make it our place for dinner.  We arrived just in time because our wait was only 15 min and shortly after we were seated the wait time jumped to 40 min.  We go our drinks and ordered promptly.  I had the eggplant parmigan and my wife had the old world salad.  Now I have to mention we both had the half orders and still brought food home.  The eggplant parmigan and the salad were both excellent.  The sauce was not to acidly and the pasta was cooked just right.  We had forgotten about this little gem and will try to make it for dinner more often?"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here several times, and absolutely love it! We've always had good service and great food. Tonight was a different story and very disappointing. My husband ordered two small pizzas, a pizza crust, and a large antipasto salad. They said it would be a 15-20 minute wait for carry out but he waited over 45 minutes. Also I understand with the increase in minimum wage that businesses have had to increase their prices but your increases are steep. Especially since the quality isn't what it used to be either. Sadly I think tonight was our final meal here. So sad to see something that used to be so wonderful and so delicious turn into what it has!"}
{"text":"When ever i get to go here i am always happy with the food and service,
Never have i had a bad time here.
The small deep dish pizzas are amazing.
Nothing wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just because I was really hungry, but this pizza really hit the spot and tasted like the best pizza ever.  We ordered a medium pepperoni with extra cheese and it was absolutely delicious in my opinion.  The sauce was very flavorful and not sweet at all, which I like.  It tasted more like garlic/oregano/herbs/etc. Very fresh.  The toppings were sliding off there was so much cheese, which again, I liked.  The crust was also good.  Perfect happy medium between deep dish and thin crust.  Service was top notch.  They checked back with us several times, pizza got to our table soon after ordering, and when we left I think we had about 36 employees tell us to have a nice evening."}
{"text":"LOVE Nello's. We've been here about a zillion times, not sure how I haven't reviewed it yet. Love the thin-crust pizza, and their salads are awesome. Consistently great service. Place is always packed and has a ton of regulars - a good sign of a good joint. I've also had the deep dish pizza and it's great too. Also have tried a few pasta dishes, and have never been disappointed. Can get pretty noisy on a busy Friday night, as the acoustics aren't great and if you mix in a few screaming rug rats, it can get loud. But I consider it part of the ambience of a family-type joint. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If you want good pizza, go to Nello's. That's it, bottom line. I'm partial to the thin crust pizzas, especially the buffalo one! My fiancé loves the Skinny aka meats galore. We always order for pick up, and they are always accurate on their timing which is never extremely long. I don't think you can be disappointed with anything you get here."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good. It has really good flavor. The only disappointment was the wings. I thought they would be more crispy but they weren't crispy at all and the flavor wasn't very good. But I'll definitely be back for pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza family friendly environment we really enjoyed our time here how salad is excellent as well"}
{"text":"\"You better cut the pizza in four pieces because I'm not hungry enough to eat six.\"  ? Yogi Berra

Nothing beats a cheesy deep-dish pizza with all your beloved toppings.  That original pan crust is crazy delicious.  It's always busy here for a reason.  I personally love the BBQ Chicken.  If you grab it to go, make sure you toss some fresh cilantro on top for even more flavor.  Their wings are also incredible and they even throw some Parmesan on top of the Garlic Parmesan Wings for more cheesy-goodness.  Nello's pies are flavorful and packed full of calories so if you're on a diet, leave it outside and indulge.  This 30+ year-old award-winning establishment is made of love.

I think of dieting for the new year and then I eat Nello's pizza.  No shame.  No regrets."}
{"text":"The Original Nello's -- Established 1983 -- has been serving by far the best pizza. And it's not just the pizza, it's the whole menu. Salads with famous house dressing, Italian spaghetti and pasta, garlic bread with Italian \"Margarita\" pizza topping, sandwiches, oven baked barbecue chicken wings, and a selection of wine and craft beer.

{"text":"I want to be able to give Nello's 3.5 stars. 

Great:
I love the attentive service, the REALLY great beer selection (wine too) and portion sizes. Family run joint, that you have to stop into if you live in The Valley. You just do.

Meh:
I can't say I am overwhelmed by the food, it's standard fair - Done right. But I am fairly underwhelmed.

Overall:
The restaurant is cozy and has that \"easy going\" family atmosphere. I do appreciate Nello's for staying in business all these years. It has a great nostalgia for a lot of us on the East Side."}
{"text":"I will upgrade their thin crust pizza to well above serviceable.  Thick crust still isn't my thing.  I really like the house salad dressing.

BTW...I only go here because my family likes it.  I can take or leave."}
{"text":"I wanted a  bite size portion of cheese and mushrooms  with cheesy goodness.  Didn't happen"}
