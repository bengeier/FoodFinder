{"text":"Easily the best hoagies in the area. Sausage and Italian especially. They also have an Italian signature sandwich on ciabatta bread that is very good. It has roasted red peppers on it.   Serafina's is a little hole in the wall pizza place across from the caboose next to tambellinis.   Their pizza is also very good. Our staff orders the square pizza with thick crust. I usually steal a piece or two. Very good very cheesy.   So if you are looking to shake up your usual pizza shop order try these guys. You will definitely go back."}
{"text":"If this review only considered the hoagies, then it would easily have 5 stars.  The hoagies were great.  Unfortunately, the pizza was incredibly mediocre.  There was a healthy amount of cheese on the pizza, but the sauce and crust were very bland.  In addition, the pizza was too greasy for my taste.  If you are in the mood for a hoagie, this is definitely a great place to go. Go somewhere else for pizza."}
{"text":"First, I would like to say, this place has wonderful pizza. However, last night, we ordered and the delivery gentleman was standing at our door telling my husband how slow business has been for the holiday and that he checks every pizza before it goes out. I open the box and the top of the pizza slid across the whole pie and into the corner of the box. It was soggy and I ate it with a fork...now \"real\" pizza lovers eat their pizza by hand! LOL. Anyway, we didn't complain, but I am giving them a poor review right now until we try again...because we will. I just felt \"duped\" by the guy who delivered the pizza because he was way off the mark in checking this one!"}
{"text":"I was writing a review tonight for a terrible experience I had at Jersey Mike's down the street, and decided to look for something that was close and had good reviews. Serafina's has a bunch of good reviews/awards, so I figured this would be a good choice. Since the review actually got me in the mood for I sub, I decided to try the turkey hoagie. It was probably the best I've had in the Bridgeville area. The bread and meat were very high quality and it wasn't over or under toasted. Definitely will give there pizza a chance, as Big Guy's right down the street is average and nothing to write home about. Give this is shot if your by Railroad St."}
{"text":"Great food! Had the meatball hoagie.....zucchini planks ....and salad ...all fresh ....all great! !!!"}
{"text":"Really great pizza (we prefer the round).  Great italian hoagies.  Nice delivery people.    We order from Serafina's regularly.  We've had a few mix ups with our orders but Serafina's always makes things right.    Did I mention REALLY great pizza and hoagies?"}
{"text":"God has blessed Serafina's Pizza.   REAL pizza; and I've lived in Italy! This is better. It's perfect."}
{"text":"We live in Collier Township, and Serafina's and Tomatoes II are our go-to pizza delivery services. I prefer Serafina's pizza over Tomatoes II's, and my absolute favorite pizza here is the round tomato basil pie. Order it, even if you are traditionally a meat lover, and I'll bet you love it. Just to be clear, make sure you order the ROUND tomato basil pie, not square. Other pizzas here with different toppings taste good on the square cut, but I prefer this particular pizza on the thin round pie. I'm also a fan of their Italian wedding soup, and their service and drivers have always been really nice to us."}
{"text":"Not sure if this is a fair review as all I have ever tried is the square cut pies. With that being said the \"Deluxe\" square cut version is almost a 5 star!!!  Excellent taste and quality toppings. This pie is a treat for special occasions.....  The other square cuts with standard toppings are very good and better than most Bridgeville options.  With this place in our backyard why would you consider Pizza Hut, Vocelli's, and any other bargain basement Pizza????"}
{"text":"I first tried Serafina's in December of 2012.  It was the day after my sister's wedding.  I lived in Dayton, Ohio at that time and was crashing at my sister's place for the weekend while she was away on her honeymoon.  I was lying around and had a sudden hankering for pizza and wings.  I don't eat in Bridgeville very often and wanted to try something new so I turned to Yelp.  Once again my fellow Yelpers didn't steer me wrong.  I order a Sicilian peperoni pizza and some wings.  The wings were out of this world and the pizza was really good.    I made sure that I left the menu for my sister and told her to give it a try.  She is now a regular.  If you are in Bridgeville and looking for a pie or wings, defiantly give this place a try.  I really had trouble deciding between 4 and 5 stars for this place.  In the end I reserve 5 stars for places that I'd insist people from out of town try.  While this place would be on the list there are several others ahead of it... but I'd give it a 4 and a half star rating if I could."}
{"text":"I'm in Pizza Heaven with thier buffalo chicken pizza! I also had thier chicken tenders...it isn't Raising Canes, but they are still good. Yummy place. Nice people. Plus the price is right on the money.  Usually a slice and bottled cold drink is $3 and some change."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Virginia and found this to be the only place opened on a Sunday night.  We ordered pizza, Italian hoagie, hot wings, bread sticks and a salad.  Everything was so delicious!  I was really in the mood for the Italian hoagie and my only regret was that I had to share it!  Pizza was also wonderful as were the wings.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"They have a superb Sicilian pie and some of the Best Wings I've ever had delivered. Good Stuff."}
{"text":"I am Italian, and I must say that this is THE BEST pizza I have EVER eaten!  I ordered a veggie pizza one day, and it was so good that I had to call them to tell them so.  I've also had the basil tomato (usually called a margherita) and it now is running neck and neck with the veggie in my book. Everything is fresh and flavorful.  Love, love, love it. - Amen"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The pizza was so good. We found this place on Yelp, while on a business trip in Pittsburg. Definitely a great spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a pizza to split for lunch.  Ordered the small pizza with some toppings for take out.  The menu had a tossed round pizza on top, so I thought that was what we ordered.  We received 6 pieces of the Sicilian Square pizza, so a little surprise.  The pizza was pretty standard square pizza with a good sauce, cheese and toppings."}
{"text":"I have been staying in Bridgeville for a week at a time for the past month. I live in New York City and am no stranger to some great Pizza. In many of the Pizza places here its not what I would consider good and in fact really bad in most cases. But Serafina's is a different story. They make a truly excellent Pizza. EVERYthing about the pie is right, including the crust which helps to make this one of the best Pizzas I have had outside NYC. The Hoagies are very very good as well. Add to this the friendly and prompt service from the guys in the back or Emily out front, and you have a \"go to\" place right in Bridgeville. Whenever I am back in Bridgeville I will be back to Serafina's for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken wrap and the grease actually ran out of the wrap, soaked the wrapper and made it through the bag. So that is disgusting and how can chicken be so greasy? I don't know but they accomplished just that. The onion rings were \"tough\"? Amazing you could ruin onion rings. Threw it away and bought food to prepare. Never wonder why you are having a slow time, the food needs to be edible."}
{"text":"Really good pizza!  I have my choice of many Pizzerias in this area, and I am always impressed with Serafina's. I started ordering from here before I even lived in the area when I was staying at the Hampton Inn last Christmas. The pizza is excellent, and the delivery time is always short. I highly recommend!"}
