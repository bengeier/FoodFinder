{"text":"We had a reservation on a Friday night at 6:30 and the place was practically empty. We asked for a room which had space for our legs below. Service was fine. 

The food was fine. Nothing above and beyond what you would expect. The sashimi pieces were a good size. The sushi rolls didn't have too much rice. My tuna/avocado tartare appetizer was bland so it tasted like a tuna roll without the rice. 

I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and have tried Kirei three times now. I really wanted to like it for convenience sake but won't be going back again. 

I have tried their ramen, sushi combo and sashimi tray. The ramen was ok but not very good value as they only give you 2 slices of pork. The nigiri, maki and sashimi weren't good both times that I tried it (most recently last night). The fish was not fresh at all. The salmon was very chewy (I didn't even know that was possible) as were several large chunks in the spicy tuna roll. The albacore tuna was inedible. I actually stopped eating after a couple of pieces for fear of getting sick. The ratio of fish to rice in the nigiri was not right either - too little rice and too much fish but I guess some might like that.

Service was decent and decor is nice but the music they have playing in the background is terrible - think Muzak but worse.  We did takeout last night just to avoid the experience.

Perhaps I was unlucky with my experiences but the third time was definitely not the charm in my case!"}
{"text":"The quality and taste of the sushi was decent here, but not enough to justify the pricing and small portions. The small amount of rice given in their nigirizushi AND makizushi was a huge negative for our meal. The term sushi refers to the preparation and enjoyment of well-prepared vinegared rice. By taking out most of the rice, you basically empty the soul and meaning of sushi. I recognise this is a little strict and traditional, but it is the least a sushi-enthusiast who's traveled to several parts of Asia would expect (especially when your restaurant is named kirei SUSHI).

Almost all items including the dessert was severely overpriced.

This place only gets 2 points for the restaurant's aesthetic design and above average service. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I've given this place a couple of tries now and haven't been impressed with anything I've had. Worse still, they seem to believe that + mayonnaise = + flavour. So wrong."}
{"text":"Decent sushi but nothing to rave about. We had a spicy tuna roll which was good. Ordered the volcano roll and the sunrise roll as well. Volcano was messy which I didn't care for.  The sunrise was pretty good. Basically a cooked Philadelphia roll. I have to say though Miso soup here was top notch. Better than most places.
All in all, kirei is not a place I would go out of my way for but it's decent if you are in the area and in the mood for sushi."}
{"text":"In town for a few days, I was in the mood for sushi, but really wanted delivery.  I know, I know -- the intersection of \"good sushi\" and \"delivered sushi\" is usually pretty small.   Unfortunately, my experience with Kirei bore this out.

The delivery speed was relatively fast, but the sushi/rolls just were just not that good  I had a rainbow roll and several pieces of tuna sushi.  The rainbow roll was a hair under \"okay\" -- pretty flavorless, but the tuna was completely off.  I had to throw most of it out.  Honestly, a waste of money.

Now, this is just one experience at one time, and I did order a bit late in the evening (50+ minutes before closing, though -- which should be more than enough) -- so this may have influenced the preparation."}
{"text":"I followed a chef from one of my usual haunts to a new restaurant - Kirei - located where Young Thailand (then Ivory Thai) used to be. The large and newly renovated space was clearly built for big crowds. Groupings of 6 and 8 are all around. Of note are a number semi-private kotatsu tables along the North side of the room, divided by shoji screens. The decor leans toward sleek but softens the trendy tone with comfortable warm accents nearer to the sushi bar.

Showing some fusion (stay with me here) elements and Korean dashes, the menu is large - almost overwhelming. Nevertheless, we chose a la carte (vs omakase). On order was okonomiyaki, yaki nasu, the kirei shot, kiri tanpo (pan-fried rice sticks), kim chi risotto, and the pollack roe somen.

Some small and very cute complimentary dishes of a sauced vegetable, lotus root, and a fish ball come out from the kitchen, along with some cold noodle, and miso soup. A nice touch to begin and flesh out the meal.

Favourites were the yaki nasu (no crispy skin, but nicely done), pollack roe somen (spicy, cold, hot, very good and different), and kiri tanpo (the pan-fried rice sticks in a sweet soy sauce were quite good). Talking with the chef, most of the items were still very new to the kitchens, so many of the dishes was a first attempt. A fairly decent-to-strong showing for a new place.

I'd go back to try more dishes when things even out."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner using a wagjag coupon, which was an awesome deal at $20 for $40 of good food.

This is one place I would return without a voucher, but having one makes the meal/experience sweeter! 

They serve up Korean and Japanese dishes.    

The portions were generous!

I had one of the best tasting bibimbap here!    
Their chicken udon noodle soup was pretty big.  

Definitely left the restaurant very full, as the meal came with salad, miso soup, small side of edamame beans, and noodles."}
{"text":"Creative, well presented sushi. They have excellent wasabi - I believe it was grated, not at all like most sushi places wasabi paste. Fish was fresh, even on a sunday night on a holiday weekend. I bit on the expensive side, but I appreciate the quality."}
{"text":"Tasty, well presented food and attentive service. The decor is pleasant, with large booths and a number of private sunken rooms. The amuse-bouche served at the start was a nice bonus."}
{"text":"Great sushi place. I came here for lunch and ordered the sashimi bento box. The meal came with lots of sides, included a soup and salad, and was very reasonably priced. The presentation of the food and the quality of the fish was among the best I've seen in a Toronto Japanese restaurant. Not too mention it was delicious. This is nothing like the \"fast food\" sushi places all over town. I felt like I was eating gourmet at a price I could afford. I will be going back."}
{"text":"One of my genius fellow interns made a  reservation for all of here last night for Winterlicious and wow is this place ever nice. I can't understand why it is so empty. The Tuna/avocado tatare is really good and all the sashimi tastes really fresh. I particularly liked the maki as it didn't have tons and tons of rice. I finished off with the tiramisu which was good. Not great but not bad either considering this is not an Italian restaurant. I guess it is a little more expensive then most sushi places but at 25$ for  3 generous courses, the winterlicious prix fixe is reasonable. I would definitely come back here again"}
{"text":"Kirei's attractive storefront caught my eye while I was wandering about (I'm not from Toronto) looking for a lunch place.  The place is very spacious, clean and nicely decorated.  Excellent service, the sushi was quite good and good value for the money.  Comparable to a good NYC sushi restaurant.  I was impressed and would come back again, well done!"}
{"text":"I really hated to see the previous occupant of this space (Ivory Thailand) leave, but am pleased to find that Kirei is a more than suitable replacement.

I tried one of their Saturday lunch specials, a bento box meal with gindara (grilled cod) as the main attraction. I was delighted to find the food to be delicate -- by which I mean that it didn't exhibit the usual greasy heavy-handedness and blandness of many of the so-called sushi places in Toronto. 

The meal got off to a good start (or pre-start, if there is such a thing) when the server brought a complimentary appetizer -- a small portion of warm white rice noodles in what tasted like a bonito broth.

The meal then formally started with a bowl of miso soup, perhaps a little lacking in flavour but pleasant nevertheless, and a small, refreshing salad. 

Then it was on to the main meal, which certainly had great presentation -- and, fortunately, proved to taste as good as it looked, too. The gindara was perfect in texture and flavour, and was served on a bed of pan-fried vegetables. You don't get a lot of fish; this was a thin slice, perhaps five inches long and about a quarter-inch thick. But together with the other elements of the meal (see below) and taken in tasty morsels with the fluffy rice, the serving was actually most satisfactory.

Besides, taken with the other elements of the meal, there was really no danger of the lunch not being filling. The meal included a bowl of rice, and the other tenants of the bento box itself were veggie tempura and a piece of shrimp tempura (also not heavy-handed -- good shrmp-to-batter ratio!), half a dozen California rolls, some edamame, and a piece each of steamed dumpling and siomai (or reasonable facsimile). 

The dumpling and the siomai were probably fillers to make sure the customer did not go hungry. While they tasted OK, they looked like they had been taken from one of those frozen dimsum packages you buy at the supermarket. They did not detract from the overall quality of the meal, though, and I felt that the $14 I spent for the Saturday special was well spent. This initial experience will certainly drive me to come back here to try their other offerings.

{"text":"Fresh, tasty, not expensive. Nice service, outdoor tables. We've had some sushi & sashimi, all very good."}
{"text":"Do you like ambiance? Darkness? Spacious dining? (versus elbow-to-elbow cramped up dining in fluorescent lighting?) This might be your spot. 

Prior to stepping foot in this establishment, I always wondered how Kirei stayed open because it always looked dark and empty inside during dinner time! I must admit that the darkness in fact kept me away from trying them for a while... but I've gotten over my skepticism and dined there a few times since. Kirei might not be my top choice but I would not unfriend you if you suggested to go there. The self-confessed sushi snob in me of course frowns because they are not authentic Japanese, but hey, I've finally started to accept that I live in Toronto and not Vancouver or Japan! This is adaptation at work, guys, check it.

They have a daily special consisting of some kind of drink/roll/sushi. I can't give you the whole range because it so happens that everytime I go in it is a drink + salmon sushi/sashimi for $6. Not bad! Servers are friendly and attentive. Food comes up at a decent pace. I don't think it's an especially inexpensive place to dine but I think that comes with the territory of edging the financial district and St Lawrence Market.

And yes, sometimes we get so lazy that we do order takeout from them as well (party tray take out date night for two... whaaaattt!!! don't judge). Fish quality is alright, the assortment is nice, price is fair, and they are quick. I would recommend that the next time one of you folks dropped the ball on your turn to cook and want to not be in the dog house ;)

Atmosphere - 4/5
Service - 4/5
Food - 3/5

{"text":"Make reservation private booth as too much sun can warm the fresh awesome tuna and salmon.  Luckily my kids gulfed down the food really quick. Much better than AYCE. My wife and kids love this place it is now our favourite non-AYCE. 
Worth the drive from Brampton for kids. This would great date night too. Even have booster seats for kids. 
Parking is available since we came at 3pm on Saturday. Food is 4.5, drink selection is good though I could not order as I am the only driver. Prices is fair $30/person should cover it though we had order with voucher from team buy."}
{"text":"Visited this sushi bar during the summerlicious event and it was packed, managed to get a barside seat which was fantastic! They have both an indoor section and an outdoor though I feel that their outdoor patio isn't all that special and better ones can be found in the city. 

First impresions were great as the waitstaff were very generous with their attention and very friendly (earning their tip!) the sushi chefs were also quite friendly and helped me with my choice of fish for lunch. 

I enjoyed their lunch time sashimi  plate, which consisted of 15 pieces of delicate and very good quality fish. salad and miso soup was automatically served with the order and I found that both were good but their salad was more of a standout. The meal in my opinion looked better than their summerlicious offering and I would definitely go there for lunch again, though it would have to be for a better reason than just being hungry.

The prices are pretty standard and you're looking at  an under $20 lunch.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Classique, sans plus sauf peut-être trop d'espace et pas suffisamment fréquenté."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a 3.5 stars. We often eat here and also get the take out (maki tray is only for take out and not available on their dine-in menu). The quality of the rolls is quite good (4/5) and the service is quite good (many of the workers don't speak English well but are very polite and helpful). The reason that I didn't give this a higher rating is because I find it too expensive for the quality of food. The special rolls are all between $11-$20, where you could go to another excellent sushi restaurant (To-ne on Queen/Spadina) and find the same quality roles for $8-$13. The last time I was there, I ordered salmon sashimi and one roll and it cost me $29 after tax, without a drink and tip. I think that they are trying to cater to the business crowd (which is great because they have good lunch specials), but based on the quality of their rolls, I don't think it's worth the price. If they either increased the quality or decreased the price slightly, they would definitely monopolize this area since it's one of the few parts of the city that aren't saturated with sushi restaurants!"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite local sushi place. I've often walked by to see a full house inside, and had been meaning to check it out for months. Finally had dinner with a friend a couple of weeks ago and it was great! The service was super attentive, the food was delicious, and the prices were reasonable. Additionally, they were very sensitive to my food allergy which was greatly appreciated. 

I was so impressed that I called ahead the following week and ordered a tray of sushi for a client meeting. Although they don't open until 11:30, the chef offered to come in early to prepare our sushi. 

Delicious Sushi + Five Star Service. I just know I'm going to be a regular."}
{"text":"Good balance between value & price. It is pricier than those Chinese-owned sushi places we're all used to, but it's way better.

Coming here on a Saturday night with my wife using a voucher, we discovered they have $1 oysters here on Saturdays, and they were good!

The seafood here is also very fresh. Good service among the staff as well.

Only drawback: Robata grilled meat wasn't quite up to par.

Would definitely go back and bring others."}
{"text":"solid lunch spot with really good prices. If you want high end sushi go to Nami around the corner."}
{"text":"**2.5 stars**  visited Jan 17, 2013

Let me start by saying that Kirei's rating suffered due to service.  This is my first visit to Kirei and I'm big on service (having worked in hospitality for 6 years) so doubt I'll be back.  Too bad for Kirei, I live AND work within a 5 min walk of the restaurant. 

Service:  2/5
Server was nice (but seemed inexperienced); I do have a couple of service complaints, may or may not be connected to her.

Issue #1:  Made opentable reservation ~75 min prior to arrival, requested a window table if available.  Kirei has a rectangular floor plan with windows on 3 sides, 2 of which have tables (1 side is bench seating tables while the other one are the private rooms).  There are more window seating than non-window seating.  Upon arrival all bench window tables were taken and we were led to one of the private rooms - the only 1 of 4 that does NOT have a window (the ones w/ windows did not have people seated either).  Didn't make a big deal, just assumed the others were reserved for bigger parties, but when a party of 3 got seated at one of the private rooms w/ windows half an hour after we were seated, I questioned our server on why we didn't get a window table.  She left to \"look into it\" and a few min later a different server (manager?) came by and said our server must've seated us here because he accidentally took our window table and apologized.  Still doesn't explain why we weren't given the other private rooms with windows and then he said something about perhaps our server was frazzled.  At this time I told him that it's my first time at the restaurant and he said something about \"oh it's your first time?  Well if I remember you next time...\" didn't really say what will happen at this \"next time\" though.  

Issue #2:  I don't eat salmon.  My bento box comes with salmon sashimi and I asked if I could substitute for surf clam.  On the menu there are 3 kinds of salmon sashimi priced at $7/8/9, and surf clam was $6, so I didn't expect this to be a problem.  Our server checked and said the chef will charge an extra $2 for the substitution...AFTER she had already started serving the soup and salad that comes with the bento boxes.  What if I wanted to change my order based on their refusal?  I said this was my first time at the restaurant, noted the price points and said straight up (but nicely) that this is not a good first impression.  She smiled and apologized, which is all she can do as it's not her call.  It's their right to be inflexible, but I am annoyed that a request to substitute for a cheaper item free of charge was denied, as many restaurants will accommodate such a request (for example Bikkuri @ Yonge & King will give you all broccoli tempura as the veggie tempura free of charge - and this is a higher cost substitution, broccoli replacing potato/yam/root veggies).  I would like to think that had I questioned about the window table fiasco before this request, I would've been allowed the substitution...but then again I would also like to think that when you ask for a window table when one is available, you would get seated at one...

Food:  4/5
Meal started with a complimentary amuse-bouche of garlic ramen.  I ordered the Kaki (oyster) fry as an app ($8 for 4 pieces) and the sashimi bento box lunch special ($13), and my DC ordered the maki bento box lunch special ($10).  The kaki fry, while small, was cooked perfectly.  My sashimi bento box came with:  miso soup, typical japanese restaurant green salad, bit of edamame, 2 pieces each of:  yam tempura roll, california roll, spicy crab roll, 4 pieces of dynamite (shrimp tempura) roll, and 2 pieces each of:  tuna, butter fish, some other white fish, and 3 pieces of salmon (which my DC got to eat).  A pretty good value for $13. The lunch specials were pretty good especially considering pricing, so it's too bad about the service.

Ambiance:  4/5
It's a nice place, but not super fancy.  

Overall, staff did acknowledge my complaints and apologized, so that's a plus, but the lack of remediation efforts left a bad taste in my mouth.  It's vexing when you REQUEST A WINDOW TABLE but are the ONLY TABLE in the restaurant seated at one WITHOUT A WINDOW.  When I tell you about the error and also tell you that it's my first time at your restaurant, I'd expect a better response than \"well, if I remember you next time...\".  I'm here now, so why not take care of me now?  I don't think it would've made a difference to them financially to, say, comp my $1.50 for the green tea, and the gesture would've done a lot in terms of client satisfaction.  Or, offer me something like a complimentary dessert for my next visit - then they wouldn't lose anything unless I came back (to spend more money), but would've shown an effort toward client satisfaction.  I would still recommend that people give this a try, as my review is based on one visit, and everyone has an off day.  I just got to be the one to experience it :)"}
{"text":"Kirei is a relatively new place, and I would love to see them succeed.  Simply the best sushi in its category in downtown Toronto. My partner and I have gone twice.  The first time, upon entering,  we felt slightly anxious, wondering if the restaurant was perhaps trying a bit too hard. Once the food started appearing: wow!  Delicious.  Luscious, silken homemade gyoza and delicious agedashi tofu for appetizer.  The sushi deluxe was truly a work of art; superbly fresh fish, brilliantly presented; not your run-of-the mill frozen fish.  Even the rice, pickled ginger and wasabi were head over heels above average.   What I thought was nice is that my partner's vegetarian sushi was not just an afterthought; it was taken very seriously by the chefs and the vegetable selection was interesting.  Rounded off the meal with some terrific black sesame ice cream.    And on the second visit: delicious oysters, divine sea urchin... again, definitely not your typical sushi joint.  This place shines above the rest.  

There are some Korean specialties on the menu as well.  Indeed, more expensive than restaurants at Bloor and Christie, but much better.  Case in point was my dolsot bi bim bap the other night.  The beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender, the veggies superbly fresh.

A wide list of cocktails (try the peartini and the cherry blossom margarita), and some nice white wines by the glass.  

Fantastic service: knowledgeable, warm, welcoming, and professional.

I would definitely return, and would encourage others to try it..  Not the cheapest sushi place, but it is several notches above other places.  I almost thought I was back in Vancouver for a moment!  

Still, though, with ample food, a glass of wine each, one cocktail which we split, and one dessert, and a generous tip, the bill came to about $150.00 in total.  I've spent more at other places and have not had the same satisfaction."}
{"text":"Really good sushi. Great service.  Great local place.   All at a decent price.  Been there a few times and it's always consistent."}
{"text":"Great dinner box special! Got the box that came with bulgogi, 9 pcs sashimi, 6 pcs sushi, a shrimp tempura roll, soup, salad, and rice. Great deal and price ($23 CAD).

Will definitely be back when traveling to Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place has nice decor, unique seating, and well plated delicious food. The service is great and the offer a fusion style of Japanese cooking. The prices are slightly higher but are worth it. Nice patio as well in the summer."}
{"text":"Kirei is not your typical Chinese owned sushi joint. I believe it's Korean owned. The atmosphere is much nicer. They offer nice private booths but since there were 2 of us, we couldn't use. They seemed designed for larger parties. 

The food quality is definitely a few notches higher than your typical Chinese place. We were fortunate enough to come on a Saturday night. They had oyster specials $1 each. We got 6. They give you a bunch of sauces to dip with. Good stuff.

For mains, we ordered tempura udon and Kirei sushi combo. The udon was a little disappointing. For $14, I think they could have added more tempura. Seriously udon is dirt cheap. The tempura only had 2 pieces of shrimp and maybe 5 pieces of mixed veggies. Taste is good but there's a limit to how mind blowing udon can be. Not worth it. 

The Kirei sushi on the other hand is something I'd recommend. It's 15 pieces of sushi, most of them different, + 3 pieces of california roll and 3 pieces of spicy salmon roll. If you're looking for something other than your typical salmon/white tuna/mackerel, the Kirei sushi combo will fit the bill nicely. The most amazing thing has to be the sea urchin sushi included in the combo. WOW. All the pieces were fresh and the rice to fish ratio was good. Though I do find the sushi a little small. 

The waitress we had was nice. This place is pretty good for a date. Recommended. Just note that it's a bit more expensive than your typical sushi joint."}
{"text":"Kirei Sushi + Bar is located at the corner of Church/Richmond.  As Vanessa G. mentioned, the space is gorgeous.  I like the natural sunlight that beams through the large windows (if only it is meant to slow down the feeling of wanting to fall asleep after a meal).  There are also private rooms in the traditional Japanese style with tatami floors and chabudai tables which make up a small perimeter towards the rear of the restaurant.  

The lunch specials are great.  For $10.95 I got a Nigiri Bento Box which came with 8 pieces of sushi in addition to:

Starters of:
Miso Soup
House Salad
Noodles in a Bonito (?) Broth

The Nigiri came along with:

1 pot sticker
1 variation of a siu mai
Edamame
Tempura Veggies
Spicy Salmon Roll (6 pcs)

The thing I liked most was that the Nigiri here is made with less rice which = less fillers/calories.  The sushi is thinner in shape and less round.

I will say though that I feel the fattiness of their fish pales in comparison with some of the other sushi restaurants I've eaten at around town.  This could be the cut of fish they get, or perhaps that they do not let the fish \"rest\" long enough for the fat to do it's thing prior to serving.

The service was pretty good.

Prices are quite decent for downtown.  I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Place is out of business.  See photo of front door notice. One less monster truck roll emporium, no loss to the city."}
{"text":"Good sushi at reasonable prices! The service can be a bit slow at times but it's a nice quiet joint. The Kirei combo is my fav there, best selection of sushi for the price!! Also they have ginger and black sesame ice cream!"}
{"text":"Coming here on such short notice, I was served with courtesy from the staff.  Ordered the miso soup for the first time in my life and it was delicious!  The spicy salmon roll was unexpectedly tasty, again I am trying something new.  The chicken udon we ordered looked great and turned out to be very flavourful as well, minus the mushrooms because I'm not a fan.  Honestly this was the first time I ever ate with chopsticks so I am grateful for the spoon!!  All in all a great place to visit for Thai food."}
{"text":"Place has great decor especially with the private rooms.  The special of the day was 10 oysters for $12 which is a great deal considering you get 3 varieties plus the size is actually decent.  The rolls are fresh and the service is great.  I would return again."}
{"text":"Kirei was part of our sushi taste-off evening. My friends and I chose a sushi venue in the city (and one from Hamilton) to try their best house roll and spicy salmon roll. We took turns tasting each roll and grading them.

Contenders included:
-Japango (Elizabeth St and Queen)
-Big sushi (bloor st w)
-Kokyo (Young and Grosevener)
-Kokoro sushi (lakeshore and Yonge)
-Joya (Hamilton)

And the winners were....
-best house roll: Big sushi
-best spicy salmon: Joya

Overall, we loved every roll we tried. Rice was extra sweet from Joya. Big sushi had tasty filling. Kokyo was 'man sized' very generous servings. Japango was delicate. Kirei...tasted great, but compared to all the places we tried it was middle of the road. Kokoro was exceptionally well priced."}
{"text":"The space is gorgeous, loved the private rooms.   Atmosphere is a bit on the quiet side (the anti-Guu if you will) so I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a \"scene\" .  But a great place for business lunch/dinner,  low-key group dining or maybe something more intimate.  The menu is pretty large, offering up Sushi, Japanese and some Korean treats.  Presentation is beautiful, all of our dishes came out looking like mini works of art.  Most importantly the drink menu is extensive, multiple kinds of sake (unfiltered and sparkling as well), specialty cocktails and beers."}
{"text":"A bunch of us order delivery here on the reg (think: weekly)! This place is good stuff. Always fresh, though, it can be quite pricey. 

Kay, down to biz... the good quality stuff: 
Dragon Roll
Caterpillar Roll
Geisha Roll* (mango - yumm!)
Kamikaze Roll
Shumai (so cute!)
Pacific Salmon Sashimi
Atlantic Salmon Sashimi (MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH)
Dolsot Bibimbap (you can ask for more than one egg!)
Black Cod dinner (the Sea Bass is fried... so this is a the healthier alternative)
Any of the sashimi / maki trays

If you're in the financial district, they'll get you the order in under an hour!"}
{"text":"All the convenience of a downtown restaurant.  Note the + in the name.  While it does have a sushi bar, it is also a bar, a sushi restaurant and a venue in the heart of downtown.

I stopped in prior to a meeting for lunch.  As usual, I had the sushi combination off of the lunch specials.  Certainly nothing bad to report here-the sushi was fresh and tasty, and there was no hint of the dreaded \"white tuna\" (read my other reviews for a diatribe on that issue).

Coupled with a nice Miso soup and tea, it was an enjoyable lunch.  Service was a bit slow, even though I had arrived prior to the rush, but I suspect any downtown restaurant has the same problem.  It was not unreasonable.

Upon leaving, it was nice to see a Starbucks a couple of doors away so you can follow up with an after lunch beverage for your walk back to wherever you are going."}
{"text":"Been here only 2-3 times and really like this place! Decor is okay, nice place to go with friends, family or coworkers for a casual but nice/quiet lunch. In the back, they have a few tatami style rooms with chairs that have a back rest. Very nice spot to have lunch/dinner in. 

They have good quality sushi, real non-artificially coloured ginger (suppose to be white-yellowish not pink FYI), and huge visually appealing speciality rolls. After you order, they usually give you a very very tiny but tasteful bowl of noodle soup to try while you wait. If you want miso soup though, that is an extra $2. 

I have tried the spider roll, salmon roll, spicy salmon roll, unagi roll and California roll.. All very good. If you want a bit more value for your $$ you could also try their special bento boxes but they are a bit limited. Available only from 11:30-3:00pm. 

It's typically quiet here and for some reason not as popular as Nami. Yet quality I believe is better. Maybe it's because of the prices? It would be my go to place if only prices were a bit more affordable. I only go here if I am looking to splurge a bit."}
{"text":"great quality food and sushi at an affordable price. interior design is very classy. I highly recommend the special roll \"snow corn\""}
{"text":"My kind of sushi place when I have time to take a complete lunch. Also because one of my friends jumps at the sound of Kirei Sushi and is willing to give up anything to go here. I order the chicken teriyaki mostly and wash it down with green tea (for which they charge you so you better drink the entire thing)"}
{"text":"I would rate Kirei 3.5 stars. This restaurant is huge!! I mean for a place in downtown core they definitely are oversized. They even have traditional Japanese style seating which I am quite excited to try out. Overall the ambience is nice. It has a very convenient location in the heart of downtown, right at Church and Adelaide.

The first time I tried this place was on a weekday night. I was working late so I got the Kirei Dinner Box. The restaurant was completely empty when I went in to get my take out order. I wanted to use my master card and the waitress immediately asked me if I could use cash instead because they have to pay fees for using a credit card. If you don't like that maybe make it a cash only place then....don't ask the customer to do something for you. 

The Dinner Box was $23 plus tax and was huge!! It came with 9 pcs of sashimi, 5 pcs sushi and 6 pcs rolls and your choice of teriyaki. I got the salmon teriyaki. The red tuna sashimi I got along with it was dry...yuck. I wonder if it was even safe to eat. The salmon was overcooked as well and overall the meal didn't taste fresh at all. I was just left wondering if they gave me left over food from the day before or something.

I decided to give this place a second chance. Also, they had a teambuy available, so at least I won't regret it that much if it turns out to be terrible and it would assure me that my first visit was not just a one off experience.

We were a group of 6 and again the only ones in the restaurant on a weekday at 12:15 pm. Service was fast and efficient. Ordered lunch special bento boxes ($10- $14) which came with salad, miso soup and a few sushi rolls. Everything tasted good and this time the salmon teriyaki was not dry and was pretty falvourful. There was enough food for the price.

We went again recently since I had a much better experience the last time. The restaurant was pretty packed probably due to Winterlicious. Even though it was very busy the service was not too slow. We got our soup and salad right away. The entrees took a little longer to come but everything tasted fresh.

1. Tuna Tataki ($$$!?) - This is an appetizer and had 6 pieces of pan seared tuna. The pieces were a decent size but it was definitely not worth the $14 you pay for it. The fish was not seasoned at all. I am not sure what an authentic Tataki is supposed to taste like but I don't think this lives up to it in any way.
We had a bad start to the meal with the Tataki but the miso soup and salad made up for it.
2. House salad ($4) - This definitely didn't have as much avocado as they show in the menu. 
3. Sushi and sashimi bento box($14) - They had a little bit of fried eggplant with 5 pcs of sushi, 6 pcs of roll (not all had fish, some were veggie rolls), and 8 pcs of fresh sashimi. The flavours were pretty good for the sushi and rolls but the sashimi was undressed. 
4. Sushi and salmon teriyaki box($12) - This had the same 5 pcs of sushi, 3 pieces of shrimp roll and delicious salmon teriyaki.
5. Pork bone soup ($10) - It was a mediocre soup and you can get much better in chinatown for a much cheaper price. 

Overall the place is a tad expensive if you don't use Teambuy/Groupon. The lunch specials are not a bad deal if you are in the area."}
{"text":"**3.5 stars-This review is based solely on my one Summerlicious '12 visit for lunch.

I decided this past summer that I would make an effort to check out some places for Summerlicious that I wouldn't normally check out or care for.  I was looking through the lunch options offered at $15 and came across Kirei.  Everyone loves sushi! I figured normally a bento box would come up to be about $10-$15 anyway, and this prix-fixe menu consisted of an app, main, and dessert!  Whatever, it gave me a chance to check out another sushi place in the downtown core.

Newly opened just a few months before, I past by this resaurant many times over the Spring and Summer.  It has a very spacious bar by the front and many booth seatings, all newly renovated.  Also, there is a big patio in the front, although there aren't too many tables.  The two of us walked in and was greeted, sat, and offered the Summerlicious menu as well as the regular menu,

~APPS~

Ebi Shiumai: (3/5 stars)
Six mini open-top shrimp dumplings with dipping sauce.  It was good, but nothing spectacular, but I LOVE dumplings!

Pork Belly: (3.5/5 stars)
Chunks of braised pork belly sliced, served in sauce. Reminded of mom's cooking for a little while, but mama does it waaayyy better!! This was tasty nonetheless.

~MAINS~

Beef Terriyaki: (4/5 stars)
i don't usually like terriyaki dishes because i find the meat rarely cooked right, and it's just terriyaki sauce (which I'm not a crazy fan of) poured over it.  But, this was 2 thin steaks over rice.  Beautifully presented, well cooked, and quite delicious!

Sashimi+Sushi+maki: (4/5 stars)
5 pieces of assorted sashimi, 4 pieces of sushi, and 6 pieces of spicy roll. What a deal!!  I am such a sucker for beautifully plated foods because I believe we eat with all our senses.  It's also nice to know that the chefs took the extra 30 seconds to care for the aesthetics of my food.  Everything was quite standard to taste, but I only wished that the sashimi came in thicker slices.

~DESSERTS~

Ice cream: (4/5 stars)
Sucks they only offered ice cream.  It would've been nice if they had other things.  Oh well, great variety though.

Aside from out 3-course meal, we also decided to be pigs (as usual) and got 2 more apps to begin with...

Oyster Shot: $6.95 (3.5/5 stars)
I love oysters and I love shots! This is a match made in heaven!!! I know a couple other places around town serves this too, but I really wanted to have it that day.  It came in a tiniest, cutest martini glass with a tiny oyster, salmon roe, green onions, quail egg, and seasoned well.  I gulped it down like a champ and sighed a satisfying \"aahhh\"!!!  A tad pricey for what it was and portion though.

Shrimp and Crabmeat Stuffed Avacado: $8.95 (2.5/5 stars)
Chopped shrimp and faux crab mixed w a salad dressing, served in a avacad half.  It was okay.  I can definitely make better, and not worth the price.

Service: 2.5/5 stars
Meh.  Friendly, but the server didn't seem too knowledgeable.  The manager/owner came by to take our orders because our server was nowhere to be found... she seemed quite green.

Overall, quite a nice place.  Sushi quality was quite decent and again, I LOVED the simple elegant plating.  Summerlicious was a great deal for quality and portion, but the regular menu seemed to be just OKAYY."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I purchased a Groupon/Team Buy coupon for Kirei and I always assume I would get sub-par service for using a deal, but they proved me wrong.

We received complimentary fried fish pieces and small servings of noodles before our actual meal. We ordered 3 rolls and chicken katsu dinner. The Kirei roll was amazing- big, crispy goodness. But we were so surprised with the chicken cutlet dinner plate since we got 3 cutlets! The dinner also came with a bowl of rice, miso soup and salad. Not bad for $13.00. 

Kirei really delivered and were smart in using Groupon to promote their place because we're definetly making this place our go-to Japanese spot."}
{"text":"I loved the place when they first opened in 2012 but they have gone downhill since. It's not bad but mediocre, replacing the former fish with common and cheaper qualities. It doesn't wow me."}
{"text":"Sigh. This review was tough to give, as it could've been anywhere between 2 and 4 stars.

Let's start with the positives. I came here with a friend for Summerlicious this afternoon at 12:30, and we got the last seat in the restaurant (it helped that we reserved). We were given the menu and our order was taken in about 3-4 minutes. Not bad to start.

I ordered the miso soup, green salad, ebi shiumai, sushi/sashimi/maki, and green tea ice cream. The miso soup and green salad tasted nothing special (the soup was a little salty though). The ebi shiumai tasted really good! The sushi/sashimi/maki tasted very good as well, and I especially love how there's a much higher raw fish-rice ratio compared to other restaurants I go to. Finally, the green tea ice cream was a great dessert to finish.

Everything with the food satisfied me. The service, after having the order taken, was a near disaster. I understand it was a busy day today due to the fact it was a nice Friday, but many of the servers were confused in their roles. There was a long lineup of orders by the sushi counter, and at one point I saw 15 dishes lining up ready for serving, but no servers were going to pick them up. I didn't receive my shiumai until 1:00, and my sushi/sashimi/maki until around 1:20. I finished everything by around 1:30, but the ice cream didn't come until around 1:40, and finally the bill didn't come till around 1:55. After 1 hour and 35 minutes, I finally left the restaurant at 2:05, since I had to ask for the credit card machine, in which no server was around for about 8 minutes before I finally got one's attention.

What probably saved this from a 2-star (or even a 1-star rating) was the fact the manager came out to me as I was signing my receipt saying how they were horribly understaffed and completely underestimated the demand for Summerlicious this year. They only had two sushi chefs, four servers, and two chefs serving what was a full house restaurant. In a way I felt bad, but I did give them just less than 10% tips; something I almost never do in restaurant.

Free wifi! Password is the phone number. Perhaps as a sucker for free wifi that might have contributed to the 3-star rating I gave. However, be warned."}
{"text":"Ordered sashimi queen combo (if i remembered the right name) and green tea ice cream. Preserved with a tiny bowl of noodle, but definitely traditional asian taste, which is good for me. Sashimi is not bad, i like green tea flavor. Servers are good to talk, pleased me a lot."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. The waitress was very attentive, and made herself available for us at all times. For the location, the food was very reasonably priced. We ordered Robata Skewers + a pint (much smaller than expected), the Queen Sashimi combo (30 pieces of assorted sashimi), and the Volcano rolls (maki with spicy mayo). 

The food was fresh and delicious.  The menu seemed catered towards small groups of people, but the choices for two people were fine. If I was looking for a tapas style place with friends, this would be a great option. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The server is very bubbly and nice which is rare to see at a sushi restaurant. The special rolls are unique, HUGE, and delicious. Normally I don't prefer large rolls, but when they taste this good...I don't mind. They also have a nice choice in desserts. It is however quite pricey, but that doesn't mean you don't get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Was there for lunch today. Floor service=clueless. Food service=really slow. Unfortunately I had to leave without having any food."}
{"text":"Service: 4 stars - waitress is very friendly and helpful. We notified her that my lunch mate has some dietary restrictions and she did a great job to notify the kitchen and manage to meet the requirement in all the courses. 

Food: 4 stars - sashimi fish is fresh and tempura is crunchy. Portion is generous. My friend ordered a salmon steak and it is well prepared. 

We also ordered dessert - black sesame ice cream. Ok but not impressive. 

Dinning hall is spacious and comfortable for having a quiet dinner with friends. 

Definitely will go back. The daily special is quiet good on top of the regular lunch special."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. The staff is great, and the sushi chef(s) know what they're doing. We were very impressed with both taste and presentation. I would return next time I'm in Toronto, Ontario.

Went right at lunch opening time. Friendly service but a bit spotty once it gets busy. We had kids though so it's also nice that we didn't feel rushed to leave by them. 

We ordered bento boxes, ramen for the kids and a chicken teriyaki. It's not adventurous blow your palette food but is satisfying typical Japanese fare and came quickly since we were one of 2 tables at first. 

I would definitely return, the prices are good and the restaurant is kid friendly (ie. not tiny and crammed like most downtown restaurants) There is diaper change table in women's washroom."}
{"text":"$10 for 3 huge B.C. oysters and a pint of Sapporo (subbed out for 5oz Pinot griggly) happiness - the oysters weren't very fresh (why west coast? As a Nova Scotian I am like \"eww w/e/w/ew/ew/e\") but I can't really complain at that price. Salmon sushi was good, and the service was very good - a fairly large patio facing south is a bonus. 

Conclusion: Life isn't a big deal. Eating some mid-priced sushi. Tastes just fine."}
{"text":"I came here with a large party for dinner one night and the restaurant was pretty empty. Despite that, service was pretty slow. Maybe I'm just spoiled with really delicious sushi normally or the one day I was here they were having an off day but I thought the sushi here was sub par. We ordered a wide assortment of different rolls and sushi and I didn't really care for any of it. The quality of the food was average to not that good and the look and feel of the restaurant just felt boring. Unfortunately I was unimpressed and doubt I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with the BF on a Friday night. Service was not great here, they only had 2 waitresses working. We literally stood at the door for 5 minutes before someone even greeted us and the restaurant was not even busy!!! Food orders were mixed up with our neighbouring table and it was generally slow.  Waitresses barely checked on us. Food was very average, I can find sushi just as good down the street for cheaper and much more attentive staff! Sorry Kirei, u need to hire more/better/faster staff."}
