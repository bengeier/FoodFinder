{"text":"This \"restaurant\" is located INSIDE PNC arena! It is in fact, not a restaurant, but a food vendor with picnic tables next to a large number of portajohns. It is extremely overpriced and sells the same $12.50  cans of beer that are sold all over the arena. We arrived early enough to go to a real restaurant, but nowhere on its website or on Yelp did it indicate it was inside the arena. By the time we had followed the driving directions and gotten into concert traffic it was too late to search for anything else. This needs to be fixed so no one else wastes their time with a paid babysitter expecting a real restaurant before a concert."}
{"text":"I can't believe Zac Brown would put his name in this.  The pork was burnt. The street corn was just a boiled peace of corn with a wallop of some white sauce dumped on it.  Then paprika lightly sprinkled on top. The taste was horrible. Incredibly disappointed. Would no go back at all.  You are better off with chicken fingers and fries.  Stay away."}
{"text":"If your at PNC pavilion this is the spot.    That mojo taco was the bomb.   Even had some red cabbage slaw. Definitely had a line but worth the wait.  We got the last tacos because they ran out. Too bad you can't find this place outside of PNC.  Will be coming to this probably every time I am here for a concert ."}
