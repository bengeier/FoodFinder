{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite dive bars in North Las Vegas. Place is dark, a little charmingly dirty (think Double Down Saloon), they have 3 pool tables and dart machines, an old jukebox and OLD slot machines on the bar top.  They're on their third restaurant leasing the kitchen? But this Italian kitchen is SUPER GOOD!!! Much higher quality than you would expect from a service window in a dive bar in north town lol  Drink specials all the time, cheap drinks in general, random bar folks from all walks of life and really friendly bartenders.  LOVE this dive bar!!!"}
{"text":"I always wondered about this place being in the back of a derelict Lucky's grocery store; after seeing it there for 14 years curiosity finally peaked.  This bar literally is place where everyone knows your name.  As a newcomer I was thinking - this place is weird.  Probably a place that doesn't see new people too much, but I felt at home after a beer or two.  I sat at the bar with a friend and ordered some sandwiches.  The spicy chicken and meatball were about average bar food.  It hit the spot.  Cheap too.   The service was good - the bartender was friendly.  I would say this is your classic local dive bar; The place is dark with low ceilings, pool tables, juke box, darts and a cigarette machine.  The men's bathroom had a vending machine with a variety of lascivious wares...     If you are in the area it is worth stopping by for a few beers and some bar food."}
