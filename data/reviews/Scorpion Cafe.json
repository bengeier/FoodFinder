{"text":"I am so excited that this cafe exists, there are so few food options in southeast Henderson. They have a great diversity of options, from pizza to a salad bar to gourmet sandwiches (ham with brie and cranberry chutney, what?!). The staff is super friendly (they often give me free small samples to try things) and the prices are totally reasonable. That sandwich I mentioned? 6 bucks and it was BIG. Big slice of pizza with roasted veggies? 2 bucks. Did I mention it has a starbucks? If you catch them on a day with the chicken parm, I strongly recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Scorpion Cafe at Nevada State College is a wonderful place for breakfast or lunch. Definitely, the most reasonable place to eat in south Henderson. The pizza and salad bar is great, and the daily specials are a real delicious value. Also, if you feel like you cannot live without Starbucks, you can get that too! Yes, NSC has a Starbucks. Next time you are in the Wagon Wheel an 95 area, stop by the Scorpion Cafe!"}
{"text":"Having eaten at MANY different college campuses in the past I have to say that Scorpion Cafe is one of the best. It has a lot of selection and the menu changes daily, meaning that I never feel like it's the \"same ol' same ol'\" when I find myself going there for lunch. More importantly, everything is made fresh and right in front of you (although there are a few ready-made selections if you're in a hurry). And let's not forget that the prices are reasonable! All in all...a great addition to the campus!"}
{"text":"The Scorpion Cafe is accomplishing something that is rarely achieved by any eatery, much less a cafe on a college campus.  The Cafe has been open for just a few weeks, but so far they are: 1.  Offering an amazing variety of high quality food (from bacon avocado burgers to more exotic fare like risotto). 2.  Providing some of the best customer service that I've seen in a quite while.  Everyone who works there is incredibly friendly and helpful, and when you submit a custom order, they get it right and they make it clear that they're happy to fulfill your request. 3.  Serving it all up at very competitive prices.  Whether you are a student at NSC or local community member, I strongly recommend giving this small but mighty cafe a try.  There tends to be a good amount of *free* parking to the east of their new student center building."}
{"text":"This is yet another reason to spend some time on the campus of Nevada State College. The veggie burgers are terrific, the pasta specials are delicious, and the prices are really reasonable. However, the best deal is the pizza. Mmmmm, Pizza. Affordable, tasty, and quick. You can grab one of the pre-made thin pizzas or they will make you a personal pizza while you wait. Both are excellent."}
{"text":"I was desperate. I know the food here is cruddy. I've had it before. But I had no other choice right now and my stomach is gurgling. I just paid $4.75 for some nasty mac'n'cheese. It's not that this is a rarity. I ate here about 5-6 times last semester as I was meeting classmates here. Every time I was horribly let down by the quality of the food and even more let down by the price for such shoddy food. If it were good, ok, I'll spring for it. I believe I paid $4 for a blah grilled cheese. $4 for something my 9 year old can make at home by himself with 30Â¢ worth of ingredients. Do what I normally do, eat before coming to class."}
