{"text":"Great service and great food. I always love coming here for dinner. The owner is such a sweetheart. I recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Chicken was juicy and moist, potatoes were delicious and the rice was plentiful. Ordered the family meal with both rotisserie chicken and BBQ chicken combo still was enough to last two days. My new go to place for Portuguese food!"}
{"text":"Normally we come to Galina's to order the whole chicken combo dinner that comes with two sides (rice/potatoes) which comes out to $27.00 roughly, and we have never had any issues with the takeout, in fact they are very generous with the portion size and the quality of the food, it has always been optimal....which unfortunately cannot be said the same for today's event!   Today we decided to dine in the restaurant as we have never sat down there, and have their special which was a two leg octopus legs with two sides and from the regular menu we ordered the half chicken with also two sides.  The owners daughter today was very brisk and didn't even engage like she normally does, which was strange, she seemed like she just didn't care today for what ever reason. When we got the food we were sooo shocked at the very little amount of rice and potatoes that we were given!! It was like a bad joke I thought....everything was cold!   Also, apart from the chicken being very cold it was also a bit hard which tells you that it had been sitting there for a while, and when you are use to having amazing food from here and then you get crap than you know there is a problem!   The place was empty with only a couple people apart from us and I just don't understand how they failed sooo bad in my eyes with this one time!  The two leg octopus special was ok but nothing great or even to write about, especially for the near $40.00 bill we forked out!!  When we went to go pay there was no thank you no nothing....it's so weird because this is not what we have been use to for the many many times we've come here to have takeout!   Over all I think this place is good for takeout since they seem to treat their customers way better when they just pick up and go ....it doesn't seem like they want anyone sitting there from what I got.  We will try it again but this time we will go back for only pick up as this seems like the better way!"}
{"text":"Normally this place is generous and I enjoy supporting local family owned restaurants. We received a quarter chicken dinner buy one get one free at the Santa fest parade.  We went to use it and the chickens in both meal were so small - and when we asked that one not have rice and potatoes and add lettuce instead.  They refused.  We are so disappointed. It cost us $17 and they weren't even nice"}
{"text":"I came here on a thursday evening. I ORDERED 3 whole chickens so I had to wait. They told me they were out of bbq.. so i got 3 whole rotisserrie. THE FLAvour was delicious and it seemed to have alot of chicken. The rice was simple and good. But the potatoes!! Were seasoned well and soft. I really enjoyed the potatoes! I wanted to try the grill chicken but   even the rotisserie was good.. so cant complain. The sauces were good. The spicy was    not spicy in the beginning but after a few seconds u feel the heat. The mild was sweet and delicious. Honestly i will come back again. And yes there are seats so u can order but keep in mind i think its less of a sit down restaurant. They are to busy at the cash to give u a full service. I DONT mind that..its the same if u go to a nandos.. call ahead of time if you have a big order.  And i do plan to come back. I really enjoyed the flavours."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and extremely well priced. Hot serve options vary, which is good.  Go with the roasted chicken instead of the BBQ. Both are good but the roasted tastes amazing and it is leaner (likely not to have been drizzled with oil to keep moist).  They often have seafood if that's your thing and it smells fantastic.   Hot serve is usually a meat mixed with veggies and sauced sparingly.  Quick service and servers are very helpful and polite. Doesn't tend to be over busy but the area isn't bustling; remote-ish."}
