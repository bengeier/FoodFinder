{"text":"Always good and fresh ingredients are in the teriyaki chicken plate. Just enough sauce, not over-powering."}
{"text":"Been a loyal customer for over 10 years. Two reasons...the food is always good!  And the staff is outstanding. They care about making sure everything is perfect."}
{"text":"SURPRISE! Yes I had a surprise birthday party here and it was amazing. I pre-ordered food and beer and Saki and then ordered more. They were amazing and couldn't have asked for a better night or better service. There were 14 of us there and the food was raved about-but then there were \"regulars\" in the group so why wouldn't they like it. We had some non-sushi eaters and they enjoyed shrimp, beef, and chicken. What a great atmosphere for a small gathering and they were awesome!!!"}
{"text":"A hit for sushi lovers in northeast Mesa for a long time running. I love the rolls there but if I was going to order off the dinner menu for other food I pass. The staff is always courteous and helpful but don't speak fluent English so well. I will return."}
{"text":"We've been unfairly using Osaka as a baseline for Sushi and Japanese food in general. This place was ok."}
{"text":"I admit, I'm not a fan of sushi or any kind of seafood. But! My in-laws adore this place and every time I see them, they are dragging me here! Got Sushi isn't just Sushi though, they have a regular menu for people like me. They have chicken and beef dishes too, but I admit, I am usually here for the chicken.. I haven't really tried anything else! I'm a huge fan of their Shirley Temples. My brothers and I usually share a pitcher or two between the three of us while my husband, father in law, and mother in law get alcoholic beverages, either beer or Sake. My husband and his family even have their own custom chopsticks here, which I'm envious about, even though my skill with chopsticks is lacking to the point it's embarrassing..   The very first time I ever came here with my husband and his family (we weren't married at the time) the wait staff were super nice to me and were very understanding with my non-seafood-eating ways. They were even nice enough to bring me a fork for my rice and chicken without me explaining my klutzy ways with chopsticks!   The best experience I've had at Got Sushi was when the whole family and some of my cousin in laws came out and we all sat at the table where they make the food in front of you (I forgot what they called this!) and it was the most fun I've had with food! I know you're not supposed to play with your food, but this was very entertaining and every second was filled with laughter! I recommend sitting at these tables if you go here, you'll never have a better experience!  As for cleanliness, I would give this place a 10/10. You don't smell any bad fishy smells like at some other sushi places. The bar is clean, the table tops are clean, the place where they make the food in front of you is clean. It's all very nicely cleaned!   All in all, this is a great place, and if I was a fish lover, I would come here every day. Even though I'm not, I would still come here! They have very good food, great drinks, are very clean, have very friendly staff, and is just an all around fantastic place to hang out with friends and family. But that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"I went there with my daughter and her friend because she really wanted to sit at the teppanyaki table and have the teriyaki chicken.  I ordered sushi and my food came out right away.  I was not impressed and my roll fell apart.  Then, we sat at the table for 30 minutes waiting for their food to be prepared when the cook came out, he went to a different table and prepared food for a take out order.....only one teppanyaki cook was working.  He was very nice and friendly and I know it wasn't his fault but seriously, 3 tables of people waiting for food to be prepared because they only have one cook working?  We definitely were not impressed and won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place was nice. Went with my sister and my mom. Nice atmosphere, cozy. The shrimp tempura was good, The seaweed salad was good. Will return soon !"}
{"text":"The sushi and the food are usually pretty good- the prices seem to be a little on the high side.  I am not a have of the service - it can be real slow and sometimes the wait staff are not overly friendly almost leaning toward the rude side.  I will keep going back though because the food is good and it is close to the house."}
{"text":"I am a fan and Yay! for that. We moved from the Seattle area, where we got fresh uni (sea urchin), periwinkles, a special kind of pepper you can only get in Kyoto...oh, and we've been to Japan twice...should I go on? We're spoiled, in short. We've tried a handful of places and were rightly impressed with Sea Saw, but can't afford that on a regular basis (and it was a little too western for us--better for special occasions). We've tried Got Sushi now a few times, and every time is better than the last. It's nowhere near the caliber of sushi we're used to, but you can tell that they aim high and seek out the best fish they can get their hands on/afford. Our faves last time were a kind of \"without rice\" roll, spicy tuna roll, maguro and wild salmon. The last time we were there we had \"erotic\" sake cups...when the glass is filled you can see, you can guess, right? We're careful to drive when we can handle it, but we're also incredibly grateful that this is right in our 'hood, since driving at night and cameras and Sheriff Joe, well, it's all a bit much isn't it?"}
{"text":"The waitresses were very rude. I came well dressed, went inside and ordered a beer but then realized I left my thumb drive in my car. I intended to spend a few minutes working on a project while awaiting my food. Thus, I told the waitress I'd be right back and even left my laptop and IPhone on the table while I briefly went outside. I was followed by a waitress- as if I'd leave $2k worth of electronics on the table and leave after only having ordered a beer that was still full. After finishing dinner and paying, the waitress had the nerve to come back and open the bill holder and obviously looking to see how much I tipped, which was 20%. I have never came across such rude waiting staff and will not be back."}
{"text":"My most favorite Mesa sushi house.  Everyone there is FANTASTIC!  I've been there a few times and more than willing to drive 1/2 hour there just for their awesome food and service!  LOVE LOVE every roll/plate that they have had thus far! I have brought my son, friends and trying to get together a group of friends to go! Gotta share the addiction of this place! :)"}
{"text":"Had sushi rolls. Rice was dry and the flavors just didn't  do it for us. Nothing imaginative . Boring. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here.  Waited over 15 minutes to order and gave up.  Waitress didn't do much to acknowledge us until we told her we were leaving."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi palce in the Phoenix area! It's always fresh, they use the best cuts, and you'll never get that minced crap in their rolls that you get at all those trandy places."}
{"text":"Loved it. Sit at the grill and order off the the teppenyaki menu and you'll also be entertained by the chef. Everything was cooked to perfection and  seasoned perfectly. Saki was delicious and the service was the perfect mix of attentiveness and allowing you to not feel the staff was hovering. Prices are reasonable and a good ambiance to boot. Excellent for a large group or just a couple to enjoy the food and show."}
{"text":"Lesson learned: if you're going to eat in an establishment called \"Got Sushi?,\" you need to hinge your expectations on that question mark! ;-)    In all seriousness, in a rotten stroke of luck, every roll we tried either tasted spoiled or was completely flavorless. The edamame came with what seemed like half a pound of table salt dumped on top. The servers were weirdly intrusive, asking rude, personal questions and lingering at the table while we tried to eat. Maybe we got them on a bad night, but I'm sorry, ewww and nope. We left most of the food on our plates and two of us ended up getting sick on the little bit food we did eat. This is legitimately one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to--take your $$ and your appetite to RA, Osaka or Red Koi if you're looking for decent sushi in the area."}
{"text":"Some others may be looking for the perfect sushi BAR when it comes to their sushi preferences, however some others, like myself, appreciate having the option of both sushi bar and tepanyaki tables.  Fortunately, Got Sushi provides both.  I have had excellent experiences here with great service from both waitresses and sushi chefs.  The staff has always been friendly, polite, and timely.  It has become the go-to-place when we want sushi, especially after we try other places and are usually disappointed.  Plus, it's right down the street and is reasonably priced unlike other places that are charging for their fancy decor."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the food is consistently good.  I've tried all manner of their sushi and have enjoyed it all.  Sometimes I go for sushi and sake bombs, or I go for the tepanyaki experience.  They have plenty of seating, a comfortable sushi bar, and four tepanyaki cooking tables.  Their tepanyaki is always good, and the chefs recognize me whenever I return.  They  accommodated me - with absolutely no fuss - when I requested an extra egg in my fried rice, no charge.  As others have said, the portions are hearty.    The service is usually pretty prompt, but it slows down when very busy for obvious reasons.  The only negative I can think of is it's usually too loud when busy, I wish they had some dividers to absorb some sound - although this is probably inherent of the open design philosophy.  The price is also cheaper than a benihanas.  Good food, decent prices, moderate to good service, good location with easy access.  I will continue to return."}
{"text":"After reading many great reviews on this place, my husband and I decided to try it out.  I'm sure the experience of someone making the food in front of you dazzles the mind, but the food is bad. My husband had the Teriyaki chicken and I had the Crab Balls with Spicy chicken.  His food was edible, but mine was bad.  I haven't eaten at McDonald's in over 4 years now, and I would rather eat there."}
{"text":"Finally a sushi place just a couple of miles from home!      I've been here countless times, and always leave satisfied.  Sushi bar and Teppan tables, great food, decent prices, sometimes so busy that the service is on the slow side, but otherwise a good choice if you like fresh tasty sushi and a full selection of alcohol.     The atmosphere is not sophisticated, but not dumpy either, clean and asian looking.   The clientelle are mainly young to middle-aged couples and families for whom chain restaurants (Mesa is filled with them) are not an option for the night, and who are tired of driving to Scottsdale for anything other than."}
{"text":"Two stars is all I give this place because of service. I really like the sushi here but after more then one really bad experience with the service, my good will has run out. Now I just avoid the place."}
{"text":"We love this sushi place, not just for the fantastic sushi but the staff is so generous and interested in you as a customer. I observed several customers coming in throughout the night recognizing and calling out the staff by name and it felt like a great home atmosphere. My husband had frequented many sushi bars, but keeps coming back to this one. I now understand why. Visited this place again about a week ago and my review status still stands.  The food is outstanding and the staff is very welcoming and attentive, especially to our 6 year old son whom they doted on . I appreciate their level of service in a time when service is less than desirable these days."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here. The staff are very friendly. The sushi and teppanyaki are respectable. Kids love the teppanyaki show, and dads will like what is at the inside/bottom of the \"special\" saki glasses ;-)  Domo arigato!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal with my friends on Friday 12/29/17. The service was great and the sushi was the best I've had since the last time I was there. The wasabi roll was killer as was the eel and everything else we ordered What a friendly and welcoming place"}
{"text":"Really fun.  I always take people from out of town there.  Always good after the river too.    Sometimes the hostess gives me a hard time about reservations for the Teppan Yaki, but it's worth it..."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a sushi fan, but I loved it here!  Service was ok... but the food was great!!"}
{"text":"I love Got Sushi...it is my go to Sushi place when I'm hankering for something crazy! And the teppan chefs are amazing and entertaining! The key to this place is to ask for stuff not on the menu. The owner makes some amazing rolls that are sure tickle your taste buds. Friendly owners and staff and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Best Service!  We have been here over 15 times and have had great service and incredible sushi.  They are always friendly and go out of their way to be nice to our 3 yr old son."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi in Arizona. Helpful and friendly staff. Try the crazy roll if you like it spicy."}
{"text":"My Family and I went to Got Sushi the night before Thanksgiving.  The four of us walked in right before a larger group of about eight people. Being first come first serve, we asked the hostess/manager to seat us at the teppanyaki grill. The place was packed and there was only one grill available. The hostess proceeded to ask the group behind us if they had a reservation, to which I clearly heard a gentleman in the group respond \"No\".   the hostess then informed my family that there was a reservation for the lone available grill that \"will be here in about 10 minutes\".  We decided to sit elsewhere and have sushi instead of waiting for the grill. Once seated, I look back at grill and see the hostess had seated the 8 person group at the \"reserved\"  grill.  That's right, the hostess bold faced lied to us so that the larger group could be sat at the grill.   Oh it gets worse.  I decided to not make a scene about this lie and ruin the dinner any further.  we placed our sushi order and also some chicken yakisoba and an appetizer of green mussels. The yakisoba came out first, before the appetizer, and not with the rest of the food. PLUS it was with shrimp, not chicken.. so my wife just left the plate and waited for the waitress to return to fix the mistake. Someone came out of the kitchen, took the plate that had been sitting in front of her 10 minutes, and then took it directly over to another table that must have ordered the shrimp yakisoba. WHO DOES THAT?   they did bring out the correct chicken yakisoba, before all the other food.. again. 30 minutes later, the sushi arrives and is sub par.  like most of the other complaints on here, dry rice and old tasting fish. definitely not fresh.   As I am asking for the check to leave this disappointing night, they bring out the mussels! yes the fricken appetizer mussels! I say \"no way\" those were supposed to be an appetizer. The waitress says \"ill put it in a box to go\".  After seeing the look of death I gave her, she offers to take them off of the check. I still don't know if she did.. they have hand written orders/receipts and are unreadable and not itemized.  At that point, I just wanted to go and never return. This was such a bad experience that it prompted me to open a yelp account. thank you Got Sushi for lightening my wallet $60 and a truly unforgettable evening, no matter how much I will try."}
{"text":"I usually make it to this place atleast once or twice a year over the past 10 years and I have never been dissapointed. The place is small but quaint and they  have teppanyaki, if that is what you are looking for. I typically venture here for the great rolls. I haven't had one I didn't enjoy..I like to come here after a good day hike. The Got 1 and Caterpillar Roll are both excellent. The Got One is wrapped in cucumber and is refreshing. You are also served a bowl of Miso soup and you get a sweet sliced orange after your meal. The seaweed salad is also excellent. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sat at the sushi bar and everything we ordered was very good. We had the soft shell crab roll and loved it. We have eaten at several sushi establishments around the area and \"Got Sushi\" is  among the best. My wife likes mild so she had the California roll and I liked the Boston roll. We will go here again."}
{"text":"We love the shushi and the teppanyaki. Its close to us and the service is good. They get pretty crowded and do take reservations. Would recommend."}
{"text":"The service here was very friendly. The sushi was completely covered in sauce and  out of the three rolls we ordered the Negihama was the only one we enjoyed."}
{"text":"This place seems darkish and outdated with diner type tables and such when you walk in. However, it's actually a great restaurant and the food quality is legit. The bento box lunch special was absolutely FULL of food... I could not eat it all and it was only 9.50 or so. Cannot beat that deal!"}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for the last few years and we absolutely love their sushi! One of the best places in East Mesa. Their rolls are huge and they have a large variety of specialty rolls. If you're a fresh fruit lover, the mango philly roll is pretty good. I also love their sweet shrimp nigiri, the head is fried to a crisp and delicious. They also give an orange as desert that's always very sweet. Mickey is a super sweet sushi chef and very friendly that works Tuesday-Friday. Definitely check this place out if you're looking for good sushi and skip on the place across the street."}
{"text":"SIMPLY AMAZING!! It was our first time here and we got quite the variety. From the fast service, amazing sushi guys, and vibrant atmosphere we had a wonderful 5 star experience! I would highly recommend this sushi spot, you just have to come in and experience the food for yourself! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible!! Ordered the Teriyaki chicken it was like a wet meat sponge.. With a place like Zushi across the street they need to step up their game."}
{"text":"We went to Got Sushi Saturday night to try the  Korean Bar B Q. The marinated short ribs were excellent, I like all the little pickled dishes that come with it. The kids enjoyed picking their own food off of the table grill. My daughter has to have her California Roll to go with her ribs. We order sushi, fried rice, and bar b q, so everyone happy. Service is good, food is \"just right\"."}
{"text":"I thought the food was decent. I took my kids to try sushi for the first time, the waitress did good at making the. Feel comfortable with the chop sticks. But the happy hour prices weren't that great. They say they had a kids menu but didn't have one. I don't know that I would go back. There are better places to go for sushi. The Las Vegas roll seemed greasy to me, compared to others I've had. The beer and wine prices were great for happy hour."}
{"text":"Two words: real crab.  I've been here many times over the years, but the more I branch out to other sushi restaurants the more I appreciate Got Sushi.  On Happy hour prices you can get a California roll - with REAL crab - for $4.  That is what most places seem to charge for Krab.  I've only ever come for sushi at lunchtime (came once for teppanyaki at dinner) but service is always prompt.  Some days they are more friendly than others, but overall everyone is pleasant.  Today, everyone went out of their way to be friendly, the rolls were delicious, and I got that little orange at the end for dessert.  I definitely recommend this place for good sushi."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years and have never had a bad meal. The staff is very friendly and the menu has a wide variety of options.   This place has the best fried tofu we've ever eaten. We would also have to recommend the Got2 roll and the chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi, great service.  Brought an extra soup for guest no charge (we split an entree) I would definitely eat here again.  The nigiri was fresh and tasty, the menu had quite a selection, some of the rolls looked delicious."}
{"text":"We've eaten at this place three times, and each time the sushi was excellent.  Service is always good and the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere,  staff is very friendly and you can definitely see that they care about customers with how they interact with repeat customers. Miso soup is good but not much to say there is Miso soup, the squid salad on the other hand fantastic not over seasoned or drowning in the sauce and portion size is larger then expected. The itamae is very pleasant and more than happy to answer questions and explain different dishes. Ordered the GTO roll very good but if you have a problem with smooth texture don't get this,  flavors mingle well and nothing is overpowering. The other roll that was ordered I didn't ask the itamae, I just told him something special and spicy. It was chopped ahi tuna, avacado, sliced jalapeños and so many other delicious items to list, but it the roll was sliced as usual laid in its side and piled high with the chopped items and served in a boat. The presentation was gorgeous. Crazy Roll!  After I was finished the itamae gave me a sliced orange served in it's the rind to complete the meal."}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST sushi in the Valley!! My family and I are regulars - we love the fresh sashimi and rolls. The owners are simply the nicest people and their entire staff is the best."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food even better. Sushi was fast and the wait staff friendly. It felt like everyone in the place knew each other and open to making mew friends. Reminded me of Cheers! Well done!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and the food is always awesome. The service is great as well however no much for talkers. Most of the time I go I order there Volcano Roll and let me just say that no one makes it as good as they do. I will be going back for more soon."}
{"text":"The ONLY negative I have to say about Got Sushi is that it isn't closer to my house. :) I had a phenomenal experience here! The Lees (owners) not only provide exceptional food--their sashimi plate and Korean bbq are beyond--but they make you feel SO welcome. It's a cozy place, and you seriously feel like family by the time you leave. I had the pleasure of trying--literally--almost item on the menu, and every dish is delicious (you can taste the freshness of their sushi), and just beautifully presented.  Love this place. Love the Lees. Would recommend it to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi is \"ok\", the grill is \"ok\" but the service is so bad sometimes its comical. Everyone is nice, but they just seem un-coordinated.  Even if you go there when the place is empty, there are strange long wait times between seeing your server.  Not a bad place, but definitely not great."}
{"text":"Delicious and very attentive service. Try the Wasabi Roll, it's awesome and so is the C-boy roll. Weekday happy hour from 11am -  5pm!! very good would love to go there again"}
{"text":"The sushi here is great and I LOVE the cucumber salad. The service is always good and their other entrees aren't bad either. Can be pricey sometimes though for some entrees."}
{"text":"Got sushi is the best sushi in the valley as far as I am concerned! This is mine and my husbands favorite date night location. Every roll they have is unbelievable. I have tried spicy yellowtail hand rolls all over the valley but  got sushi wins hands-down. The best roll they have is the CJ roll. The servers and the sushi chefs are warm and friendly. They take the time to get to know you."}
{"text":"This is my husband's and my go-to place for consistent good sushi and service in Mesa.  The ladies that work there are always extra friendly.  I prefer more traditional, simple sushi rolls and those are always consistently great.  Rolls we had tonight were negihama, spicy scallops, mango philly, and Love roll.  They were all refreshing and as fresh as AZ gets!  The negihama is my personal favorite.  The mango philly roll was a nice sweet lightly crunchy roll.  I do wish they had more salmon options for rolls.  We also had the chicken garlic fried rice which was amazing and not surprising since they also have teppanyaki options and a few teppan stations if you want the experience.  Overall, a very easy-going, low key atmosphere for a casual dinner out.  It never gets super busy so it's relaxing."}
{"text":"great Happy Hour selection.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  They have Sushi Bar, Teppenyaki, and full service menu from Tables.   The Best is the $5.00 Large Beer and Saki special during Happy Hour...  Make the drive to NE Mesa and enjoy..."}
{"text":"The website is way out of date and the staff could not accommodate any sort of substitution on any level for what is posted on their website. I came in specifically for the Ginger Mahi and they no longer offer it. I don't think it was any fault of our server but they were very unwilling to take any sort of special request AT ALL. I mentioned that they need to update their website to avoid the same issue with other patrons. The server laughed at me. Not a great start.  My friend ordered two sushi rolls that tasted fine but they fell apart. I ordered the Salmon that was drenched in teriyaki sauce, it was meh.   I'm really disappointed. I'm glad I tried them though just to know better than to go back."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  My fiance and I go here quite often and thoroughly enjoy the family atmosphere!  The waitresses remember us and often give us little hints or extras to enhance our experience.  The rolls  are always delicious and very creative. The sashimi is always very fresh tasting.  We have not yet sat at a hibachi table, or had any hot food other than the fried rice (which to us, is better than the Chinese food places we've tried).   From what I've seen at other sushi restaurants I have been to, the rolls and sashimi are within the same price range. I did a little research after moving here on the lack of fresh seafood in this state.  I discovered it costs quite a bit to get the high quality fresh fish that is best for excellent sushi, because this is not a main shipping city, nor has it been a high volume seafood market until recently.  My fiance and I used to eat fish very regularly in Chicago because of the availability of fresh, not frozen fish and the lower prices of it.    The staff is great!  It is a family run operation, and it is nice to see that, since coming from the Chicago area, that's what most sushi restaurants are.  The big chain restaurants for sushi are often frowned upon.  Luckily, the owner's are originally from up there too!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, both times the sushi was served chilled and not room temperature.  The food didn't strike me as being overly fresh.  The place had that all too common unappetizing stale fish smell that greets you when you walk in.  The sushi combinations seemed very \"80's\" and outdated.  On the upside, the service was good, the TVs were playing football.  You could do worse, but you could also do a lot better."}
{"text":"I had been extremely apprehensive to try Got Sushi since it's opening several years ago.  What a mistake not embracing this unassuming sushi restaurant.  My wife and I ate there Saturday night and were blown away by the quality of the sushi.  From the nigiri to the creative rolls, everything tasted super fresh and was meticulously made.  Service is friendly and attentive.  Don't let the un-creative name or it's location within a parking lot of a strip mall deter you from going.  As an added bonus, the prices are extremely reasonable.  I would have expected to pay much more than we did!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping to give this place a 5 star and I normally do not give low stars unless I'm really disappointed. Although the place was clean, service was great and we had a free delicious miso soup to start, the sushi was not good at all. It was flat, and had no flavor whatsoever. The recommendation by the server was good and fresh but was too pricey. Every thing else was average. We also ordered two rolls that had Eel in them and they were bad! I pushed them away and wouldn't let my husband eat them. I've tried so many caterpillar rolls in so many different sushi places in Arizona and other states but this was unfortunately the worst I've ever had. I'm not going back again."}
{"text":"Nice place, this one is all about the food (decor is nothing fancy). They have tepanyaki as well as a sushi bar. So it is a great choice for small groups or couples. Their food is wonderful, our orders have always been 100% accurate. They are friendly, but every time we visit we feel rushed, if they would just slow the pace a tad bit they would get a 5 star. On the other hand, if you are in a hurry, that would be a good thing."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. I love that feel of the place. My son thinks it is super cool to have people cook your food in front of you. I always get sushi and love it! It taste fresh and is super yummy. My kids and husband do not eat seafood at all so they get the chicken teriyaki. They love it and it is always such a HUGE portion. I absolutely love their food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I recently went to Got Sushi and ordered the CJ roll. Got sushi is a little restaurant with a warm atmosphere.    The sushi roll consisted of fried tempura shrimp rolled in seaweed and rice. The outside of the roll had spicy mayonnaise, with sliced green onions on top, and smelt eggs. It was lined a long decorated plate with blue floral designs.  It is full of color consisting of: a white circle of rice stuffed with a plump off white shrimp, lined in dark green seaweed. The roll was topped off with a thin layer of pink tuna, drizzled with a sunset colored spicy mayonnaise, sprinkled with bright orange smelt eggs, and lime green onions. Everything combined stratifies the taste buds.   The variety of sushi rolls makes for a good eating. So If you are looking for a new place to try sushi, I suggest Got Sushi and try the CJ roll."}
{"text":"Our first visit with friends who recommended it. Great food and service. I would've given five stars but we felt like we were rushed from the time we sat down. We had a sitter, so we were trying to take our time. The chimichanga roll was really good. We split the shrimp and steak dinner and added an extra soup/salad: miso soup wasn't miso soup, broth with a slice of mushroom and a green onion so that was a bit disappointing cause I love a good miso soup! The salad was good. The chef was funny and great at his job!"}
{"text":"I ordered a sashimi and a dragon roll. The traditional bowl of miso soup was bland and obviously made with instant powder. The sashimi was fine and tasty. The dragon roll was made with imitation crab meat. It gave the roll a disgusting taste and texture. If you advertise for crab meat in your sushi: put real crab meat. Not imitation. Because it's just a disgusting fish paste with red dye."}
{"text":"The staff is always welcoming and know my family by name...the food is fresh and best prices I have found! Presentation is always simple and elegant! I love the Tango and Las Vegas rolls! Chefs are awesome! My kids love eating here it's a weekly favorite stop for us! Can't beat all you can eat for about $20! With teens who can pack it away, it's a blessing! And it's healthy!!"}
{"text":"The sushi was fairly decent, although I expected more! It could've been that we ate here during happy hour so the rolls were cheaper. We also ordered sashimi (salmon and white tuna) and those were good! Tempura shrimp, gyoza, and fried tofu all came with their own dipping sauces and they were delicious too! I apologize for the poor camera quality!!"}
{"text":"We have sushi once a week and I have found no better in Arizona than Got sushi.  The owner,   Silo is there often and makes sure everything is perfect.   The chefs are masters, the fish is so fresh and the price fair."}
{"text":"M and I went to Got Sushi for lunch.  The waitress was nice.  We sat at the sushi bar.  Our sushi chef was friendly enough.  We ordered Iced teas, good tea, nothing to complain about.  We had two rolls, the JJ or CJ roll and another roll that had shrimp inside and tempura flakes and sauce on the outside.  Neither tasted very fresh to me, the tuna on the JJ roll was mushy and not as cold as I like it.  the sauce wasn't very good either.  I guess the texture was just off somehow?    So the question is: Got Sushi? - no, they dont have (good) sushi  ~"}
{"text":"Best sushi in AZ hands down.  We have been regulars here for years and will never go anywhere else.  The fish is very fresh and tasty.  The owners are so friendly and very involved with not just the staff but their guests.  The ladies, table chefs and sushi chefs are always attentive and positive.  The wasabi roll and squid salad are must try items!"}
{"text":"Got Sushi has some great tepanyaki and sushi. We come here once every so often to get out sushi and tepan fix. The tepan chefs are all very good and funny, and of course, if it's your first time, you're in for a great show.   The staff here are all friendly and accommodating. At lunch, if it's not too busy, they'll sometimes chat with you, but not so much as to make your meal uncomfortable.   Prices here are pretty typical. They also have a happy hour menu, but I wish it covered a greater variety of sushi.  Overall, my family is always satisfied with our visit, and we always come back."}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first time.  It was good and I ate cooked teriyaki chicken. Fast service, nice people"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. Better sushi than we got at most places in Seattle, so that says a lot!"}
{"text":"Had to send a single star.  Love the sushi been here many times one of the servers if you get her you could be waiting a while and she forgets thing and never remembers."}
{"text":"I have been to this sushi joint three times now. They tend to get VERY busy past 7:00pm. The service is outstanding! They ladies are very quick to get drinks ordered and on the table, as well as refills. I have only eaten at the sushi bar - I have yet to try the teppanyaki. The place is clean but the tables are very closely packed together, which is fine if you are not expecting a private booth. The fish is very flavorful and the portions of nigiri and sushi are adequate. The sushi chefs are nice and will strike up conversation if welcomed - always a plus for me when sitting at the bar. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have had a couple of rolls there that were less than tasty. Most of the rolls I have had are great! Good portion not too big or too small. Overall I would say it's a great local joint when you don't feel like driving across town."}
{"text":"As a family of five with young kids, we used to LOVE this place when they had teppanyaki tables.  They ripped out those tables and have since introduced Korean BBQ tables. I'm sure this would be fun with adults only, but with kids it's a pain. If I wanted to cook for them and serve them myself I would stay home. Mom and Dad are not nearly as entertaining as the the Teppanyaki cooks. The sushi is great but the experience we once had with kids there is gone. We won't be back as a family."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Mesa! Service is incredible as is the food...fresh, flavorful and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot. I'm not a big sushi eater, but we went for my wife's birthday and she loved it. I thought it was good too. I also got teriyaki chicken which was awesome. However, my chicken came out before my rice. So I ate most of my chicken and rice separately. That was probably the only negative part of my experience. It wasn't over crowded, and it was nicely decorated. Had a few big screen TVs in there with sports and stuff on which is nice. Everything was kept clean and organized and the customer service was excellent. I never had an empty drink on my table, which is nice because I drink a lot of dodo or water or whatever is in front of me while I'm eating. It was a great place to go, this is actually the 2nd time we have spent my wife's birthday here because she likes it so much. I was just a little bit bugged about not having my rice and chicken at the same time."}
{"text":"Deliciousness in sushi form.  The Las Vegas roll is made of PURE AWESOME and you'll be doing yourself a disservice by not ordering it.  The staff is very courteous and they've even got edamame and seaweed salad.  As another reviewer said, it's perfect for a post-lake or post-tube session in addition to dinner, where it has a tendency to get crowded on the weekends.  Their serving sizes, at least for the sushis, seem to be a bit larger than Ra on Mill Ave, and you don't have pumping house/techno music to deal with -- the atmosphere is very laid back, with sports games on the TeeVees."}
{"text":"Decent food, fun atmosphere, accommodating for dietary needs.  This is more of a teppanyaki-style restaurant than a sushi restaurant, in my opinion, but the name is what it is. Maybe that's the impression I got because of where I sat. When you walk into the restaurant, the grill tables are really the first thing you see. There are 4 tables seated around the grills. When I got there, my family was already seated, so I didn't have to wait to be seated. It was a Friday night, and the place was pretty packed, though there didn't appear to be a wait.  A few of the people in my party wanted teppanyaki-style dinner, while my brother and I wanted sushi. So we got the show and some of the grill items while still eating the sushi. First, I'll comment on the show.  The show was pretty good. Every teppanyaki place entertains a bit while cooking, and Got Sushi is no exception. Our cook was a lot of fun and broke out a few different items to assist with the entertainment. I particularly enjoyed the whistle he used while steam came out of the onion \"volcano\" to bring to mind a train. The cook was quite personable and kept us all entertained while cooking.  As a starter, we got little bowls of broth and a small iceberg lettuce-based salad. I'd recommend going dry with the salad and adding the ginger sauce they bring out instead of the standard salad dressing. They said the ginger sauce is good for fish, but it also goes great with the salad.  We all got to share in the rice, vegetables, and other non-meat items that he made. We had fried rice, but without the eggs because of sensitivities for a few of us. It wasn't quite as tasty as legit fried rice, but it was stll good (though the vegetables were clearly of the frozen variety). The actual vegetable dish was pretty solid--fresh vegetables fried up on the grill in front of us with some sesame seeds thrown on top as a finisher. And then there were some noodles cooked with bean sprouts. Our chef was quite liberal with the \"Japanese ketchup\" (i.e., soy sauce). Oh, and we all got a piece of shrimp out of it, but only after our chef entertained us a bit with the then-still connected to their tails shrimp.  My fellow diners had steak, salmon, and chicken as their main dishes. All of them were quite good and had large portions. The salmon especially seemed to be huge. You get your money's worth out of these dishes, for sure.  My brother and I shared 3 different rolls and 3 orders of nigiri. The Red Dragon roll and the Got 2 were equally delicious. The Red Dragon roll was not quite as spicy as we'd have liked, but the flavoring was excellent. The Got 2 has thinly-sliced lemon on top of it, and the bitterness adds just the right extra flavor to the roll to really make it work. We also had the Rainbow roll, and it was a solid choice. The salmon and tuna nigiri were both fresh and delicious. Both seemed to have rather large cuts of fish, so that made me happy.  I especially appreciated the accommodating nature of the service. We all have various food allergies with which to contend, and they did their best to accommodate all of them. They were attentive and made sure to assist with avoiding those items we needed to avoid.  While I really appreciated the service and enjoyed the food, this just didn't seem to go beyond 3 stars for me. I am happy to come back at some point in the future, but it wasn't something fantastic to me."}
{"text":"Poor service - slow, confused, language barrier. \"Happy hour\" was extremely limited in terms of drink & food. No sushi or sashimi on happy hour, only several rolls. Overpriced for what we ordered. 3 rolls, tempura shrimp, and two drinks was $45 - everything was off the happy hour menu except 1 drink. We actually left & finished our happy hour/dinner at blue wasabi San tan mall. Will not be back to Got Sushi."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Great staff. Family owned.  The two reviews listed by Christine and Mayo - Your type of cliental are needed at RA Sushi. They live off people like you who have no idea what in the world you are talking about when it comes to Sushi. Move along now... thanks for stopping by."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for ten years now, and I have to say...  This place is as good as it gets --  The sushi is (and has always been) fresh and artfully crafted. The super white tuna especially, just melts in your mouth. You just can't go wrong here. Every roll I've had is a unique experience by itself worthy of your individual attention. But many reviewers here can attest to the quality of the food. I'd like to address the poorer reviews:  I'm surprised that some of the poorer reviews say that the rolls are bland. I guess after a long day of chugging sugar coffee and soda they still expected something to reach their dying tastebuds. But for everyone who loves nuance and flavor, the food here is second to none. If you can't enjoy fish alone without adornment, I have to wonder if you came here for sushi or flavor-blasted goldfish. The food here is something to aspire to as a lover of food.  I'm also surprised that people dislike the service. Perhaps if you are used to the restaurant sweatshops in the bay area where you can demand underpaid multinationals sweat over you to make their sky-high rent, I can see how you would be disappointed. But if you are a real, loving human being who can spare a couple hours to talk with family over excellent food, you will love it here. The food comes out at a measured pace that allows you to talk and enjoy your food without being rushed. The servers also treat customers - especially regulars - as family and friends.   I guess people also have some small reservations about the price That's understandable: Who doesn't want to save some money? That's why we have McDonald's right? You could even go to Basha's next door and make your own meal. Now you're really saving! But that's not why you should come here. There's a reason why so many reviewers and families like mine come here again and again - for years and years - It's because Got Sushi has an atmosphere and food quality that's perfect for having a good time and a great meal with family. You can't get that at other places very easily. Just try and bond over happy hour in some other bar or \"Gastro Pub.\" Not likely. This place is worth every penny, and given the grandness of the total experience, the price is breathtakingly low.  So bring your family and friends. You are in for a good time."}
{"text":"Very good sushi and they also have  hibachi grills. Fresh sushi and a nice variety. Good service"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this sushi restaurant. It's small so if you have a larger table, definitely make reservations. We had the crazy, GTO, and KS roll with saki. All very well made and fresh.   The server we had got into an argument with one of the girls we were with about what a 'dumpling' is. She has ordered them there before and the server was saying that's not what they are called and brought her out something completely different and told her she used the wrong terminology?? I don't know, it was a bit weird and turned me off. Our friend ended up knowing the owner so she came over and fixed it immediately. However, if she wouldn't have known the owner, I'm not sure how that would have been handled. Besides that, food was great and environment is fun."}
{"text":"We've tried this place a couple of times. The sushi is pretty good here, but the service is spotty at best."}
{"text":"A friend of mine had food poisoning from here 4 years ago..but since then I have noticed a great change in their quality. I have come here many times, its great to come for decent priced sushi. Its never too busy and they have a huge menu. They also have teppanyaki grills which is fun with family and friends. Have not had the food though so definitely check it out and let me know what you think!"}
{"text":"Awesome family restaurant.  Vivian did a great job (as usual) and the sushi, the fried rice, and noodle dishes rocked again.  I'm a regular, coming here about twice a month and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Always loved Got Sushi for the friendly neighborhood vibe and great sushi -- we've been coming for years. That down-home feeling got even better when they added Korean BBQ.  We were really scared to try the BBQ, after hearing about the experiences of friends at other restaurants. We shouldn't have -- staff was there to help us as much or as little as we wanted. Absolutely delicious! Don't miss the pork belly!"}
{"text":"This sushi place is AMAZING. Great service, prices (Esp. during happy hour), and of course, great food! Seriously the best salmon sashimi in the valley"}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of sushi places in Arizona and this place is by far the best one!! The staff here is great!! King Kong, Rose, Sue, and Josh are the best and are always very friendly!! The Tepanyaki chefs here are great and put on a great show!! My favorite roll is the Mexican"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for sushi. Always delicious. Always great service. Friendly atmosphere. Eat in or take out, both fabulous. My favorite is the Palm Springs Roll."}
{"text":"My husband is a huge sushi fan, he says the hand rolled spicy tuna at this place was the best he ever had in AZ! The California roll was delicious with the big pieces of crab!  Service was ok, had to ask for the check to leave, but thats no big deal... will be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Mann what can I say\" this place is awsome..... so glad they did away with RTO SULLIVAN'S NEVER really care to go there anyway.the food past my expectations with the southern fried chicken mash potatoes with the Mac cheese on the side. Left me feeling super full. Will definitely be back again and again. Next on my list is to try the ribs. Bobby Q welcome to mesa glad you came..........."}
{"text":"Luckily, we live close by and stop by often for sushi. Last night, we decided to try the Korean BBQ. It was fantastic! The side dishes (5+) were all delicious! Our server helped us navigate the bbq and cooked the majority of the meat for us. My 13-year old son had a spectacular spill, and everyone reacted so kindly and so swiftly, that it didn't put a damper on the meal at all. We have always enjoyed the Sushi and service -we now love the Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"Good fresh sushi. Nice variety. The best part? The owner, she is a kick in the pants!  Definitely give it a try"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a date and the sushi was great, reasonable price for sushi and the service was wonderful! I rarely go somewhere and feel so welcomed and have such great food. The crab Rangoon's were awesome too! It was also refreshing to see kids there and know they are family friendly! I'd highly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years! This review is long overdue. Always the same staff-the ladies are so great. We live in Scottsdale now and still make the drive. We compare all our sushi to Got Sushi-and nothing compares for the value. The salmon sashimi is what I live for here! I've never found any comparable. The salmon consistency is perfect. Also the Crazy Roll is Amazing!!! If you're into local and not necessarily being at the trendiest but by far the most authentic and kind-then definitely start coming here!"}
{"text":"I have not been here in about 5-6 years, because I had to relocate back and forth for work. This is still one of my favorite places in the valley. The sushi man remembered me, and how I like my sushi. I love it here. I will have to try to come here once a month, like I did back in the day."}
{"text":"We have been going to got sushi for the last 10 years. The staff is friendly but the atmosphere is starting to look old and worn. They really need to do a remodel. We did Teppan-Yaki but the new Teppan-Yaki chef didn't listen to how we wanted our food cooked. Everything was over.is the food quality I got sushi going downhill? Perhaps"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the area and are trying all of the nearby restaurants for the first time. We came here as we were craving sushi. The rolls were very tasty, but I wasn't a fan of the atmosphere. Because of the tepanyaki tables, the whole place smelled like it. We might go there for tepanyaki, but probably not just for sushi."}
{"text":"My favorite place by far. Love the atmosphere and love the food. Prices are decent and happy hour prices are even better. If you want a trendy place with tasteless overpriced rolls, go somewhere else. My favorite is the Mexican and the Volcano rolls... YUM, and you can't beat the chicken fried rice, it's just delish."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi in the Valley! They have some very creative rolls that explode with flavor. Also the wasabi is good which is important...strong and potent. Miso soup = yummy. The Got 1, Love Roll, Offroad roll, and Albacore are my favorites. The JJ and CJ also rock! Always fresh and always good over hundreds of trips! Go here, eat some fish, hang out, drink sake - enjoy"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 2003 or when this place open.  And it's been awesome.  Great customer service and of course delicious food.  Very comfortable and cozy atmosphere.  Try it. You'll be back....and I am always happy when I leave here and not because I'm fed. Lol...Love everyone here."}
{"text":"This place made me so sick and I have an iron stomach for sushi. The volcano roll was horrible. Tasted like old hot canned tuna fish with mayo and cream cheese. I will never even think about going here again. Also horrible service. I'm not one to write many review but this place should not have as many stars as it does. Do not go here!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Service was somewhat slow.  Ordered vegetable roll for me, Las Vegas roll for her and chicken pad Thai.  Ordered too much food.  Took most of the c p thai home.  Sushis were excellent.  Next time I will have the Las Vegas roll.  Thought the fish would be raw but it was deep fried.  Will definitely be back to try other options.  Highly recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"This is one of the most packed restaurants.  There is absolutely no way that this is the best sushi - even in the city of Mesa - because there were even some small blemishes from the California roll ($4) - slightly gummy rice.  The staff here (mostly Korean) are super friendly, and you do not have to wait long even though the entryway only holds about 6 people at one time.  There is hibachi, and the sushi rolls are fairly priced.  Everything I had tasted great.  They add 50 cents to your credit card if your bill is under $10."}
{"text":"Walked in tonight hoping for Sushi dinner for two.  We stood at the front counter for 10 minutes with no one even acknowledging we were there.  There appeared to be two waitress working, one clearing tables the other one serving.  We left and ate across the street."}
{"text":"don't use your credit card here.  mine got copied and sold !!!"}
{"text":"Rather pricey. 1 round of drinks and 3 sushi rolls came to over $70 before tax/tip for only two people. Service was just okay. Happy hour ends early, at 5:00 PM."}
{"text":"The best Sushi in the East Valley. Suki and Ke serve the most fresh sashimi. Try the Albacore tataki. YUM. And the staff will make you feel like you are coming home. Stop by and tell King Kong, Laura sent you."}
{"text":"This place never fails. We have been eating here for years and the food it always fresh and delicious. Here is the Sashimi Salad I had last night."}
{"text":"Wow, Wow, Wow!!!! Do not miss this one!!!  Unbelievable culinary talent, the taste, the presentation, the atmosphere!!! You can't go wrong here. Try the volcano roll, the \" Palm Springs, the cowboy \" yellow tail, that thing they do in the metal martini glass! YUM UNASSUMING FUN PLACE!! Thank you Ki!!"}
{"text":"Prices are a tad high but worth it. You must get the squid or seaweed salad as its a ton of squid for only $5. Sushi is of excellent quality and the service was on point. We will be back."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the valley! Very spotty service but doesn't stop us from coming back..."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The atmosphere is not as hip as other sushi places in town but they make it up with great service and great food.   Its also very family friendly, we have been bringing our kids here since they were babies.  If you order saki and ask for the special cups, they will bring you these funny cups that when saki is poured into the them and you look into it you see a naked lady!  Cracks us up!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I love bento boxes, steak, and sushi. This place offers me all of the above for a great price. The steak bento ($9.50) is huge and perfectly cooked. The miso soup was average as was the rice and salad but the tempura was perfectly crispy but not overly breaded or soggy. The California roll was great and the steak omg. So i ordered it rare amd figured theyd overcook it but it was perfect. The super white tuna is great and its my favorite. The mango Philly roll was nicely prepared and delicious. The service is good and I plan to be back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bomb. Good sushi, good beno boxes & Tepanyaki. Long happy hour & adequate pricing. We've only been once, but we'll be back."}
{"text":"Just left and I'm very disappointed. I usually love their chicken teriyaki but today was just so disgusting. The chicken was chewy and flavorless plain  no veggies what so ever. We felt bad leaving the whole plate but just couldn't eat it...also ordered Cali roll Vegas roll those were pretty good but that's about it...."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I have been coming for over 10 years. Crazy roll, spicy yellowtail hand roll, jj roll and yellowtail,sashimi are some of my favorites. Great cuts and portions always fresh sushi. My favorite AZ sushi bar!!!"}
{"text":"So good news, if you're craving a mix of Korean and Japanese - than this is the perfect place for you! Recent changes! This used to be a Japanese inspired restaurant with sushi options and chef's that cooked your meal right in front of you. If this is what you're looking for, it isn't quite the same because it is now a Korean Barbecue location instead. But don't worry! You can still order some Japanese inspired dishes and Sushi.  They are still great for serving large parties as my family and I (table of 8) came to visit recently. The service is very friendly and try to still add a personal touch to everyone's visit.   The rolls are good, but not my personal favorite. I'd rather save room for the different dishes you can make yourself with the Korean Barbecue options. My part of the table ordered the option that included Kalbi Short Ribs, Bulgogi and Pork Belly and it was amazing! Although we were originally surprised with the changes, it turned out to be a pleasant surprise.   I only rate this experience four star because I didn't get to completely enjoy \"cooking the food.\" Our server stood by and cooked all of our food for us. Although her intentions were good we felt very cluttered and didn't have our own space to just cook and enjoy. Unfortunately when I think of this experience I think of how delicious it was but how we were slightly uncomfortable without any privacy. (Yes, we should have said something, but we kept thinking, maybe something was broken on our side of the table?)...  We will visit again!"}
{"text":"1) Worst sushi rolls and tataki  in the valley(ordered the las vegas roll this time) 2) Slow service 3) Over priced  Happy hours are only from 11 am to 5 pm ( why not just say that they don't have any for employed people)"}
{"text":"The best sushi in the east valley! Actually, Got Sushi has the best sushi I have ever had. My favorites are the Mango Philly and the Jalapeño Popper! Love love love them. The ladies that work there are so sweet and always remember me when I come in. Happy hour is the best and he prices are great!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely excellent. The fish is fresh, the ambience is perfect, and the wait staff is so engaging and so much fun. My mother and I come here often and we look so forward to it every time!"}
{"text":"I came here at the suggestion of fellow Yelpster Victoria K. Being the sushi connoisseur she is I can count on a good sushi experience when she rates a place 5 stars. Located in a strip mall this unassuming little gem is nicely decorated and offers a happy hour special. One at lunch 11-1 and another 5-7. At that time you can get select items at a special price. I ordered my standard, a spicy salmon roll for $5.50 and a volcano roll for $6.50. This all came with a bowl of miso soup.   The soup came out within minutes piping hot. Not the best miso I've had, but ok. It lacked flavor. The spicy salmon roll came out in about 10 minutes. This  was the kind without the nori wrap. The salmon was fresh and the rice was perfect. The dish was garnished with a generous amount of ginger and wasabi. I waited another 15 minutes for the volcano roll to arrive. This roll is made with tuna, salmon, yellowfin, whitefish, and crab. This is all wrapped in nori with rice and cream cheese, topped with spicy mayo and then baked. This is worth the wait. I don't usually like the tempura sushi, but never had one baked so I thought I'd give it a try. This roll has a unique flavor and texture. It reminds me of baked fish with spicy tartar sauce.   There are more rolls on the menu I would like to try. For only $15.00 and change to get 2 sushi rolls, miso soup, and a soda, there's a good chance I will get to try them too."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!  Called for take out and the service was excellent.  Prices were exceptional for the quantity and quality of our food.  Rolls were delicious and unique.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Less than impressed. Sushi was worse than Frys grocery store. Prices are way high for the entire menu. Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"With some of these reviews for this place I wonder if it is even the same establishment that I'm writing about. My wife and I have stopped in here for lunch/dinner for the past five years or so when we visit her mom in Mesa. In all that time I can't remember ever having bad service, and now that we have our young daughter with us, it's been even better. They are always on top of every need and the food, drinks, and cleaning comes promptly. The price is about what you would expect for any sushi joint and the happy hour is long (11:00 am to 5:00 pm) with a decent menu. The fish has always been surprisingly fresh and the rolls are substantial and flavorful. It's not that creative of a place as far as the menu goes, and the roll selection in particular is kind of limited with way too many rolls having cream cheese, but it provides the staples with high quality. Bottom line: it's a nice go-to spot for convenience and value."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying a new sushi place in my hometown of Mesa, Arizona.  Mesa isn't my favorite place to eat...for multiple reasons, but since my parents still live there, I've learned to find some good standards.  I thought I was going to find another in Got Sushi...not the case.  The setting was sub par...way sub par.  The service was okay.  The sushi was not good...and I had a pretty ferocious stomach ache afterward and the day after as well...I blame the sauces used, particularly on the J.J. Roll.    It just wasn't good.  Definitely disappointing.  We should have just gone to Red, White, & Brew (a personal favorite) which is right next door."}
{"text":"Ordinary. That's what I think of this place.   As well as Colon Cleansing. Yep, that's right. The food is enjoyable - the big slices of eel nigiri really made my night. However, the next day, I wasn't so thrilled. Uhm, yeah.   If you have a group, sit at the Teppan tables and watch the show. That's the fun part. You can also order sushi for yourself, in case everyone else wants their food cooked before their eyes.   It's great that Mesa has a sushi place - I'll give 'em that. It's a good choice if you're in the area and don't feel like driving into Scottsdale or Phoenix. But, just be careful. Your food may escape your system faster than you can say, \"Check, please.\""}
{"text":"I was in a terrific mood. All the kids were in school and I wanted to do something enjoyable for myself. I decided on sushi and a good book. Entering Got sushi, I was seated right away and asked what is like to drink...good start. After a few minutes, I ordered and my food was brought out less than 10 minutes after that. Great. The gyoza were very good and perfectly crispy and served with a lightly spicy dipping sauce. Very good. Miso soup was very salty. The sushi...yuck. Worst las Vegas roll I've ever had. The sauce is weird tasting and I'm not sure that the crab was fresh. I did not get sick, it just was not good tasting.   Out comes the bill. It was around $12.50. I gave the waitress my card and she comes back saying it was declined. I was super embarrassed and dont carry any other type of payment. I quickly checked my account and confirmed that I definitely had more than enough money in the bank. Wondering Wtf was going on, I asked if they minded of I ran to Basha's to the bank. The waitress tells me yes but I need to leave my kindle and cell phone. I told her that wasn't going to happen and she started to get agitated. I didn't want a scene and told her I'd leave my kindle but I wanted it in her possession or behind the register. She refused and said it'd stay on the table where anyone could take it.   After a minute of quietly trying to impress on her that I wanted my kindle somewhere safe and wasn't okay leaving it out in the table and her refusing to put it somewhere safe, I said screw it and got up, leaving the kindle on the table. She again told me to leave my phone as well. I laughed and told her she had to be kidding. No way was I leaving both a kindle and an $800 phone with them over a $12 tab. Unbelievable! Not happening. She relented this time.    Got to the bank, found it they had sent a new card to the wrong address a month ago and closed my card that day. Got a temp card and hurried back to pay. Luckily the kindle was still there. I paid my $12 bill and left.    Between the bad tasting roll and the way the waitress acted, I will not be back...ever. I'll sick to sushi kee or try one of the other sushi restaurants here."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi place! The staff is awesome and always so friendly. Coming to this restaurant is always a good time!"}
{"text":"Very good korean bbq! Now we can go here more & it's closer to us. Kin kong was so nice, took care of us! Thank you"}
