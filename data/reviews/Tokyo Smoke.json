{"text":"The vibe is great and the monthly subscription is an incredible value even if you just come once or twice a week. Friendly staff, prompt and skilled service and uniqueness make this one of my favorite local shops. Would recommend to anybody who loves coffee, don't be put off by the pretentious facade, at the end of the day, it's a coffee shop that promotes cannabis which is about as unpretentious as you can get, no matter how you dress it up."}
{"text":"It's a decent cup of Americano.  The new decor suits the current trend.  Of Aritzia had a sister brother baby that sells despensaries and fresh press juices and coffee with a retail space at the back, then this is the place it would look like."}
{"text":"This is the spot formerly occupied by R2, widely recognised as a great coffee shop that was run by friendly people with good coffee. What a 180 as most of staff are rude and arrogant. The layout is poor for working, meetings, or people watching - clearly not intended to encourage customers to stay.  If you're after a great cup of coffee, consider Jimmy's across the street; if you're looking for somewhere to have meetings, consider Death by Venice just east of Bathurst."}
{"text":"Love this place. Cool concept, staff are always friendly, they've got an awesome monthly subscription plan (genius!), and frankly the coffee is on par with Crafted and Sam James. Yeah it's a change from R2.. but change is good."}
{"text":"I went in for the coffee. For a review of merchandise or anything to do with smoking, please visit the store. They sell products so you can smoke pot like it's an art form. Seriously it took me a moment to recognize some of their stuff, they could fit in some modern art museum.  Stepping into the shop, you feel like you've walked into a whole new world. If it feels unfamiliar, it's because they designed it like some shop you could find in Tokyo. Everything was minimalistic, cool modern black and wood, and professionally built. Plants drape from the ceiling and the furniture are designer-grade. The interior was made with money, something I would expect in the expensive neighbourhoods of Ginza for example.  Their actual food and drink are on par with places like the Pilot or Mos Mos, which is to say very good. I got a soy latte and it was delicious. Their pastries are also top notch and go well with their drinks. Not too sweet.   So full stars for the experience. I recommend coming to this place at least once if you're in Toronto."}
{"text":"Tokyo Smoke has several cafes around the city and my first experience was their newest General Assembly.  I have to say their Queen St spot is just as good!  Tokyo Smoke is a mixture of a great coffee spot but also sells  has legal cannibis focused items BUT I'm sticking to my vice of coffee.  Unlike the General Assembly spot, Queen St has a lot more variety of items including $160 crystal pipes, hoodies, and kettles.  You can explore the different shelves and find something you probably never seen before.  This spot isn't too big but it's enough to have at least 8 tables and one larger shared one in the back.  It's clean and open with a lot of light.  It's also crowded with the laptop crowd. So if you're able to find a table... consider yourself lucky.  As for the drinks, they have your typical espresso based ones but also a lot of interesting seasonal ones.  When I was here, they were starting their spring menu with a lot of iced ones ... interestingly enough, none of them were coffee based.  Instead they were more sweet, fruity, or herbal.  It's a nice different take instead of just regular cold brew.  Flat White - We liked the flat white so much we got a second one that was pulled from a different barista.  Though the 2nd one was prettier... the great thing was the flavour was consistent between the two.  So they're well trained to keep the flavour and quality.  The flat white was a nice deep flavour and had a chocolate note and maybe a bit of berry.  We found out that it was from one of my Toronto favourite roasters, Pilot.  What I loved about the flat white was that there wasn't a lot of acidity ... so the sourness wasn't very strong.  If anything, I would say that it wasn't even there.  It was well balanced with the milk.  Thinking about it now, I should have grabbed a bag of their beans!    4/5  Great coffee spot to grab and go or perhaps stay for a bit provided the laptop horde doesnt take up all the spots.  I have to admit that it's one of my favourite spots on Queen St W.  Sure there are a few other spots nearby but Tokyo Smoke always deliver on a good cup."}
{"text":"I was wandering around Queen street with a few friends when we came acrossTokyo smoke. I have heard a number of people talk about this pace so we figured we should pop in and check it out.  The shop is small, modern and still somehow very cosy. I could definitely grab a tea and read a book in there for hours. Tokyo smoke is such an interesting place because it's a cute little cafe that also sells really nice looking pipes and other smoking essentials. The interesting part about it is that all of the \"paraphernalia\" is so sleek, small and modern looking that some items can be passed off as decor to the untrained eye.   Although I didn't purchase anything on my visit, I had a lot of questions and the staff were very kind and helpful.  I had a nice experience and I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Tokyo Smoke is located near Queen/Tecumseth and is quite popular as it is along a busy street. I dropped by on a Sunday afternoon to try to get some work done. The service at the counter was extremely slow - I probably waited at least 10 minutes for staff to greet me and make my drink. Moreover, the drink prices are on the pricier side compared to other coffee shops (my americano cost around $4.25). Pros are that there is free wifi, I was able to find seating to do some work, and that the coffee is good."}
