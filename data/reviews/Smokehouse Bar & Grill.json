{"text":"Stopped in last night.  Had some great Rib tips and a side of collard greens.  Both were excellent.  Everyone in the place, including the owner were very friendly.  Definitely recommend for that barbeque craving"}
{"text":"The \"as yet unnamed\" Bloody Mary at the Smokehouse to be introduced in the New Year is probably the best Bloody Mary we've ever had. It has rib tips and jalapeño wrapped in bacon for a complete meal with your veggies."}
{"text":"Had just driven by on the way to an event - so decided to try it on my way home.  Ordered to go, but found when I got there they had a live blues band!  Couldn't stay-but they sounded great for the few minutes I heard and wish I had more time or lived nearby! Food was great. Wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service! There isn't too many places that have good beef ribs and this place has it. Vanessa, the bartender served us attentively and was very friendly. Thank you."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in Phoenix! Great beer selection and the rib tips are amazing. My friend had the smoked fried chicken and said it was the best piece of chicken she's ever had.  We had the fried pickles for an appetizer and they were amazing. Gonna try the ribs next time!"}
{"text":"I ordered via Eat24 to my hotel room.  The food delivered late, soggy and with missing items.  The bbq wings, pulled chicken, onion rings, fries were
some of the nastiest things I've ever tasted in life. The chicken tenders had great flavor and I imagine would have been better if they weren't soggy.  The manager Emily was extremely nice and professional.  She's the only palatable part of this operation"}
{"text":"Love their food!!!  Cannot day this enough, have been a few times.  The sauces are good, the collard greens are to die for, and the ribs are fall off the bone delicious.  Most recently, came for brunch...and it was early!!   We got there at like 9:30am on a football Sunday.  It was pretty empty when we got there, and they actually did run out of food (jalapeños for the poppers-there was a large takeout order) but they went to get more and recovered quickly!!  I ordered the breakfast tacos and (seriously) one of THE BEST Bloody Marys I've ever had!!  They have a jukebox that's fun, was disappointed when we played $20 in songs and then they switched on the TVs (with sound) at the request of another customer, but I can understand Football took precedence in that moment.  All in all, definitely recommend and will be back!! Super low key, chill place to get good bbq!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  Always stayed away from it due to the biker bar aspect.    However with the name change figures i would try it.   Had the baked beans and pork loin sandwich.    Loved it.  Onion rings are to die for.      It was clean and good atmosphere.   It was not busy so hope that changes.  I will be back soon.    LOVED IT"}
{"text":"We had an hour to kill so we stopped into Smokehouse not knowing what to expect!  What a nice surprise, not only absolutely awesome food but the bartender Emilee is incredible!!  Even though it's a drive from our home we will be back!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great menu and new place. The bartender Cherise is amazing. Try out the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Appears to be a bit of a dive - Wrong!  This dude is world class Smoke Master"}
{"text":"Great place for a casual dining experience. The brisket sliders with fries was excellent. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped by here last night (a Saturday) for some food since we had been driving past the pace for ages and never been.  The staff were amazing and came over to help us out almost immediately and brought our drinks shortly after that.  Ordered a BBQ burger and an enchilada (with chicken).  Both were good, very filling, and priced decently.  We found out that this night was going to be the first night with karaoke so ended up staying for around five hours enjoying the entertainment.  Fun night."}
{"text":"I just tried this neighborhood gem and love it!  I ordered the brisket sandwich that has onion rings and fried jalepeno garnish on it. This tender smoked brisket was EXCELLENT!  I highly recommend it and plan on coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Really really  good food! Service is great everyone is super friendly!! Vanessa is very sweet and nice."}
{"text":"Poor everything. Meats were terrible, ribs were nothing but fat and odd misc cartilage, hush puppies were tastless and dry as a bone, fries were soggy. The ONLY thing remotely tastey was the mac n cheese. Will never eat here again. A waste of a birthday dinner."}
{"text":"This place has a bar ready to accomodate anyone ready for a good time, and in the mood for any kind of drink. Now, all you need is anyone interested in the drink. The place was absolutely empty :/ It was definitely not a busy day. But there must benefits to having the place all for myself... Or so I thought. I mean it's not like they need to concentrate on much else, right? I actually wanted to like this place. It has great ambiance. It is clean, well-lighted. But other things like the music was horrendous. They had hard metal kinda music, and that was totally annoying for my taste. I ordered the rib tips (appetizer) but for the life of me I cannot understand why they have to arrive cold to the table. The ribs are delicious and such a great size for just an appetizer. The perfect amount of smokiness and tenderness, but what are you supposed to do with lukewarm ribs???! Another thing I could not understand is that my friend was asking, what kind of specials they had available, but none given, just to find at the end of our meal, after a deeper conversation and our waitress digging thru the menu that it was happy hour!!! I thought it was a joke. Back to the food, my friend had to return the greens because they were too vinegar-y, and the mac and cheese, was not to the par either. Suddenly, I understood why the place was empty. Next time I see an empty place, I vow to keep it going. There's always a reason why. Hopefully they can put it together. They got lots of potential, and based on other reviews people do appreciate them in the neighborhood... But they really need to get it together. At least have pride on your BBQ and serve it steaming fresh... That's just the way is supposed to be."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ!! We've been here a few times & always have great food & great service. The ribs tips & Mac and cheese are amazing. Relaxed atmosphere. If you love BBQ you need to check this place out."}
{"text":"I ordered the 3 meat dinner and was very disappointed. The brisket was fatty, dry and flavorless the chicken is like shredded shoe leather and the pork was just meh. The potato salad and bbq sauce were the only saviors 1 star each. Whatever you do stay away from the smoked beans with brisket and bacon! Inedible with all the flavor of dry dog food. There phones don't work well so doing a call in is more difficult than it's worth. My search for good bbq in Phoenix continues"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar.  Awesome food.  AWESOME food.  Fried okra was incredible. Beer was cold.  Brisket was incredible. Ribs were even better.  Macaroni and cheese was incredible.  Two different kinds of sauces which were both good.  Coleslaw was delicious.  Server was great. Owner was great. 10+ televisions.  Full bar.  I was honestly incredibly impressed by the overall ambience and experience from the time I walked in the door until the time I left.  When I walked in here I didn't expect what I left with.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"LOVED thus menu!  Great selection and the chef is devine!  Frankly, I was a little surprised at the quality of the food because this kind of food could be in a Houston's or a Salty Sow!  It's at the top my list for delicious food in a comfy atmosphere!  A MUST try."}
{"text":"We were initially very pleased about this place, but things seemed to quickly go downhill, until we hit our limit on the basic service we expect from a restaurant and we have not been back for a while. We like knowing the staff of our neighborhood places and they seemed to be changing servers very often. We liked the previous business and loved the staff, the reasonable prices were a plus but not the main reason we became regulars. 
The food here was good but the service was very inconsistent."}
{"text":"Really good bbq and staff! The nachos with chicken are a great way to start, the bar tenders are pretty awesome and attentive. The owner is there most nights he is a really nice guy! I hear they have a game night Wednesday's I will for sure go back to try that!"}
{"text":"Hush puppies were burnt. Corn burnt. Fish had no seasoning very bland. Grease that is was cooked in was old."}
{"text":"Great food .. let's keep out local businesses  going . You will love the food .. tell family  and friends  to try it  . Daily lunch specials and happy hour. ."}
{"text":"Your food made me so sick! I had one, yes ONE deep fried pickle and I've been throwing up for at least an hour! I don't know what that so called breading is but it's terrible! Thank you..."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The new owner is super nice, Morgan was a sweetheart. You should definitely check this place out if you like BBQ, and street tacos."}
{"text":"Place is awesome, don't let the outside fool you from the inside! The bloody Mary's are incredible!"}
{"text":"Great food real bbq and catfish is perfect love the new ownership only thing good in the area is this place"}
{"text":"The man who calls himself the owner is constantly drinking with guests and always drunk when I come in. The food is less than impressive. Don't waste you're time."}
{"text":"A great Barbecue joint down the street from my house? I'm going to make this place a second home. This place used to be called the Hammered Hog but has recently changed name, but it is still delicious. I can't imagine our neighborhood without this place so I'm going to be here often to support this great local restaurant. If you haven't been here before  and you enjoy bbq(and fusion dishes) then go for the Brisket Chimichanga (as good as it sounds), the taquitos (very delicious), or get the nachos with your choice of meat(perfect happy hour fare). This area of town is lacking in original LOCAL restaurants and this place certainly fills that niche. Please support it, or I lose my Brisket Chimichangas! 4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Nachos were absolutely horrible. Menu looked pretty good, and bar was very clean. Pretty dead crowd though on a Friday night. I might try their smokehouse burger, but steer clear of the nachos.... a snack bar does a better job"}
{"text":"Had the brisket sammy.  It was great. Service was a little slow, but acceptable.  Server was new."}
{"text":"I'm an Uber Eats driver and I deliver food for a lot of barbecue places, but I got to tell you the rib tips here are to die for ,great stuff !"}
{"text":"My new favorite place for a delicious Bloody Mary! The hamburgers are great too! Great local bar with amazing food."}
{"text":"I gave it 3 stars for the cleanliness, customer service, music and beer. But for the food! It was just not good enough for BBQ :( the beans tasted burned, the BBQ meat was dry. Even with the extra BBQ sauce that the leave at the table still gave it no added flavor. Great place for a hangout or to grab a beer, but for a meal! Well, it's a no for me. I will probably comeback for a beer and music but I'll be skipping the food here."}
{"text":"This place has a killer happy hour and some damn good barbecue. Service was good and the tv setup is great for some football watching. I'm told this place will eventually become a Kansas City Chiefs bar which will be even better to come check it out for Sunday games."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick snack while my wife was going through a training class in the area. Amazing food. Got the Rib Tips entree, they were done perfect,  the sauce just right. Got a side dish of their Cowboy Beans,  good enough to stand as an entrée all by itself. I'm a firm believer that when your side dishes have that much attention to detail, the kitchen is being run right!! My friend had the Smokehouse Burger. It was cooked to order and he loved every bite of it. If you're up in this area, it's well worth stopping in."}
{"text":"15 minutes to order the food. Another 20 to 25 minutes  to get the food. Once food arrived, one order was completely wrong. The waitress said she would fix it but it would take a while since there was only 1 cook. 15 minutes later we asked about the order and she said\"i wasnt sure you still wanted so i will go put it in now.\" Overall the food was sub par, the service was near non-existent. Overpriced food and drinks. I used to go there when it was Hammered Hog and loved it. I will not be rerurning."}
{"text":"I used to come here often when it was Hammered Hog.  Same owner now but things have definitely changed and not for the better. We always come on the weekends for breakfast.  We have brought multiple friends and family here when it was Hammered Hog and couldn't have praised it enough last year. Now...  I wouldn't send anyone there, which is sad to me cause I really like the owner and her family. There was only one cook and one server on a busy weekend.  They are always busy on the weekend,  so knowing that...  Wouldn't you staff properly?! It took over 20 minutes to get our food (the breakfast special).  The food arrived and our order was wrong.  We were missing a whole meal and they told us it would be a while for them to fix it. It took 40 minutes for them to get us the breakfast to go and that's after the first 20 ... So 1 hour total.  Then had the balls to charge us for it. The hash browns were almost raw. Just slightly cooked.  The shredded pork isn't as good as it used to be and the Bacon was so crispy,  I almost broke a tooth.  The people sitting near us ordered waffles and other breakfast items. I saw the waitress write it down correctly,  then she brought them out two breakfast specials which isn't what they ordered at all. Plus they had been waiting over an hour just for the wrong order to arrive! I would not send any of my friends or family here unless changes are made! I'm Sadly Disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered some stuff from postmates to try a new place. They forgot a part of my order. The grilled corn was the worse I've ever tasted. The pulled pork was good but that's it. The sausage was burnt as well as the hush puppies. The macaroni had no flavor to it."}
{"text":"The service was great, very cheap alcohol menu, the service was friendly and quick, always checked in at a reasonable time. The ribs were absolutely delicious, fell off the bone, the brisket was well flavored and was very juicy. The sides were decent.. not a fan of vinegar with collard greens. Being from the south it was a shock to taste. Overall everything was delicious and would definitely be back. Worth the money, and very cheap."}
{"text":"Just had one of THE WORST meals ever. The meats were awful! We tried pulled park and brisket which was terrible. Then I thought let's try, 'rib tips' since they wouldn't credit my original awful sandwich...and surprisingly (joking), those were awful too. All the meats were either fatty or tasteless. I wanted to like this local place, but we won't be back. A new name was a start, now new cooks would be next on the list."}
{"text":"This establishment is okay I was hoping that it was going to be a homerun but it wasn't. Took my father in there we had the combination platter. Again I was hoping for something else but it just was just okay."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood place to eat. Love the brisket and the pulled pork. Great drink specials and dominos on Wednesday's."}
{"text":"This place is under new ownership and is way better. The brisket was tender and good smokey flavor. The mac-n-cheese was so yummy!!!"}
