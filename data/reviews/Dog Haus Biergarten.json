{"text":"The price is great for vegas. All dogs and burgars are served on Hawaiian buns. All the choices sounded fabulous. I went with their corn dog because the root beer house made batter sounded intriguing. The all beef hot dog was so flavorful, the batter was pretty much obsolete. I also wanted to try a burger so i went with a slider. The slider is angus beef, white cheese, carmelized onions, it comes with mayo but i opted out served on a grilled Hawaiian bun was so good. I really wished I wouldve ordered a full sized burger and passed on the corn dog. The fries were crispy and well seasoned. I was suprised to see that they served beer on tap and mixed drinks."}
{"text":"So many great dogs to choose from! You will not leave hungry or disappointed. This is a must try if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"First time here. Was tasty. Just didn't seem like anything too special, other than the name or the concept."}
{"text":"Wowwww...stopped in here after a long day of Vegas shenanigans! One of my friends who lives in Vegas told me about this spot that just opened up, so we came to check it out. 



The food was crazy good, I got the SOOO Cali, loaded with Avocado and their Spicy Basil Aoli (unreal),  and my friends both got burgers, both of which were apparently great. Food took a few minutes, but I realized after the fact it's because they grill and make everything fresh, which I absolutely loved. The service was great, as all the employees were very interactive with the customers.

As far as drinks, the two I were with both had a couple of craft beers (sorry I don't remember the names) and I had their Spicy Mule cocktail. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. In fact I had two lol. It's Vegas right?

I'm in Las Vegas several times a year, and have now found my spot to go to when I want to get away from all the overpriced tourist traps! Thank you Dog Haus!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the burger I had, chuck and brisket blend, not to mention all the great combinations they have come up with for toppings. I had the The Freiburger and it was amazing. A friend also ordered the Little Mule and loved hers as well. Both were served on Hawaiian rolls, a great idea. I have been thinking about this burger since I got back to San Diego and was pleased to see they are coming soon to my town! I cannot wait. Thanks Dog Haus, I am excited to try more menu items like the bacon wrapped dogs soon!"}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious. I haven't tried the hotdogs yet because I'm more of a burger fan. The burger buns are sweet Hawaiian buns, which makes the already delicious burger even more amazing. This place does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Just ate here tonight for the first time. I wish they had one of these back in San Jose. This place hit the spot!  Apparently Sunday is happy hour all day! During happy hour they have half off all sliders.  My wife and I both ordered 2 cheeseburger sliders and one mini corn dog slider and shared the chilli cheese fries.  All items were super yummy.  We were very happy with our meal."}
{"text":"I will never go anywhere else for a burger or dog! It's a delicious explosion of amazingness in between sweet Hawaiian rolls! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Amazing happy hr prices. Got full. Had drinks. Spent less than 15$. My gf and I will be back!"}
{"text":"A little expensive, however the service and food was excellent. I got a cheeseburger combo that came on Hawaiian roll which was very good  and chili cheese dog that was also very good, but expensive I feel @ $8.00. Other than that, definitely worth trying. I'll be back.."}
{"text":"What can I say this place is pretty damn good and it's walking distance from my work. My coworkers and I usually come here once a week"}
{"text":"First time. Looking for a great burger... Found this gem. The taste and creativity is amazing. Dogs and burgers; you don't have to choose!"}
{"text":"Got four combos with some friends. I ordered the Cowboy with Onion Rings and a Dutch Chocolate shake. AMAZING! The beer battered onion rings are perfect and crisp. The rolls for the dog is off the charts. Glad I live a few blocks away"}
{"text":"This place is a must try. Clean establishment with friendly employees. The menu was great and food even better. I mean the food was really really good. Plus a happy hour! Andrew was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great service from Brisa. This place is a hidden jewel! Happy hour craft beers and deals on tater tots. Not a place to miss!"}
{"text":"Nothing like bad service to put a bad taste in your mouth. The sad part is that the food is good. Not great, but good. First impression of someone who doesn't have a name tag or introduce themselves or smile say, \" I don't eat here, I just work here,\" when you ask a question, is an automatic fail. Not to mention , \" I don't know, I don't even drink beer,\" to top it off? I don't care how good your food is, I will never enjoy myself at a place that makes me feel like I am inconveniencing you. I would rather go to work than come and eat here, because I would give better customer service and feel better about myself. What's waste of money. 35.00 for two beers and two hot dogs plus awful service. No thank you."}
{"text":"I like the decor and ambiance.  The burger was extremely messy and flavors didn't mesh as well as i expected.  Had the holy aioli...it was just ok.  I like the concept and will try the dogs another time.  Super friendly staff"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is great and the staff is very friendly. I get the sliders and they are delicious. The tater tots are also very yummy."}
{"text":"Dog was delicious. Service was great. Nice, small (8?), selection of beers with rotating taps. Not quite cheap, but far from expensive. 
I look forward to visiting again and trying some different flavors."}
{"text":"The food here is second to none. Perfectly cooked. The Angus sliders and hamburgers are phenominal. Great prices, great service, Ive already been back 3 times and will continue to visit often! Their late night happy hour is the best!"}
{"text":"We ordered a vodka and Redbull but they were out. So Andrew actually went over to CVS to buy the Redbull to make the drinks. This guy is a hero!

Oh, the food was great too. Totally recommend the tots - plain, cheesy, or chili cheesy - it's all good."}
{"text":"Nice place. Nice people. High fives are free!!! Food was really good. Add ons are generous. However it gets really expensive. Jeez. One hot dog with a bunch of toppings, tater tots, and a drink was like 20 something bucks. It was tasty though, however the cheese sauce wasn't really that tasty to me. I forget why, but I remember it not being that appealing to me. I think it might of been too salty. I don't remember though. I went here like a month ago. However, maybe I should go back for dinner tonight. I forgot about this place!"}
{"text":"They have really great hot dogs. I had a bratwurst. It was very good, I give this place 3 stars because I found I long black hair in my chili cheese tots which sort of threw off the whole experience. The people who work are very nice and the chocolate milkshake was very good as well. 

I may try this place again because the dogs are amazing, just better without the hair."}
{"text":"Great food. hotdog bun is  a Hawaiian bun which put a little twist on the hamburger and hotdog in a good way. Quality hotdogs many to choose from"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Just had the old town dog, downtown dog and holy aioli cheese burger (sampled between myself and my girlfriend). A little pricey but the food has such a unique taste and flavor that makes it a restaurant unlike any other. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Although this place is NOT all vegan , the stuff I ate was so delicious . Some vegan meat is just not tasty , but this vegan meat was AMAZING , it definitely fixed my hotdog craving as well ! I definitely recommend this place to anyone with taste buds !"}
{"text":"Glad to see this took the place of Johnny Rockets! Da Dog Haus is waaaaay better. The place is set up really nice inside and the food matches. We ordered the Cowboy and the Little Leaguer with tots and fries. Everything was on point. Perfectly cooked and it did not take long at all after ordering. The buns are toasted Hawaiian rolls and taste amazing. The staff that took our order and served us were friendly. CLEAN bathrooms.

Only issue I had was with an employee who, I'm assuming, was on break. This employee was in the seating area and was watching UFC greatest hits on his cellphone. The soda machine was out of ice when I tried to get my drinks. This employee looked up and went back to his phone. I notified the other employees and the friendly girl who took my order quickly went to the back to get more ice. When she asked the other employee for help he rolled his eyes and wasn't much help since he wouldn't put down his phone. If you're gonna be on break, go hang out outside or in the back and not out with the customers where it would be nice to have assistance when needed. Not going to let that employee ruin the 5 stars that this place deserves. This place is refreshing and really good! I will def be back here."}
{"text":"First time visit and wanted to live on the wild side, so I ordered the ANOTHER NIGHT IN BANGKOK and it was fantastic! Spicy wurst, fluffy bun and crunchy slaw with Thai flavors. It lived up to my expectations, but I would recommend colder-chilled slaw for more balance. The chili cheese tots were a great addition to the meal."}
{"text":"Freaking delicious!!! After you try this burger , in n out will taste like a cheap burger joint to you . 
PS: don't forget to send napkins to your customers , not that I didn't enjoy licking my finger when I was done"}
{"text":"WHERE IS MY CORN DOG AND CHEESE TOTS!!!This place have a worst togo system
Specially cashier, when i got at home just realized i didn't get a corn dog and cheese tots.  What a noob worker never check the order after food came."}
{"text":"More than just a hotdog place. So many options we wanted to try them all. We ended up sharing the Scott Baioli and the One Night in Bangkok. Both were a little messy but sooooooooo amazing. The ONIB was kind of spicy for me but still really tasty. The cheese tots are very good. Very cheesy. Overall we are def going back to try new things very soon."}
{"text":"I got the Das Brat and it was the best bratwurst ive ever had outside a german restaurant. This location is definitely on the frequent eats list now"}
{"text":"This place is the best when you're drunk and even if your not drunk! Bartender is super nice and on point. Food is fast, delicious, and holy moly just looks amazing. Totally recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"This place is really delicious. My favorites are the holy garlic aioli burger and the chili cheese fries. I love how they serve their burgers on Hawaiian rolls and you can tell they put thought into their menu- not the average burger joint. I've eaten here quite a bit and will in the future. The only thing that could make their burgers better is if they were cooked over a charcoal grill ( I recreated the holy garlic aioli at home that way and WOW!)"}
{"text":"Stopped by the Dog Haus for a quick dinner dog. Sat at the bar and was impressed that they had a full bar, not just beer and wine. They had the game on the TV so we could catch the end of the Oregon game. Our server/bartender was great, super energetic and we had no problem with service, quick and efficient. She shared the history of Dog Haus with us (Southern CA based). Overall, a definite do again."}
{"text":"I had to go try this new hot spot in Vegas this week. Everyone was talking about it and I felt left out. But not anymore! I tried this place and I'm now in love with their burgers!

I'm not much of a hot dog person, but coming here to see the great quality of their food really sold me. The cooks here really care about presentation and precision with making the orders. I had a very complicated long order with my group of friends and every single one of our orders was made to perfection. My friends all enjoyed the Bangkok Dog with fried egg. They said it was different but very tasty. I had their burger sliders and omg are they amazing, they literally just melt in your mouth! Their cheese tots are the bomb too! If you haven't tried the place, I highly recommend you do! Oh, and there's also a bar with lots of tasty drinks:P

My only complaint is that I think it's a little pricy, but not too much that it hurts my wallet.

***Update: The Holy Aioli is literally heaven in my mouth. Cheese tots are a great pairing for it."}
{"text":"Hangover was delicious .. slow sometimes but worth the wait.. the beer choices are pretty good and they switch it up sometimes so that's great.. I would also recommend the Bloody Mary.. they garnish if with a tator tot and bacon"}
{"text":"Wow, really tasty and interesting hot dog combinations. Everything is homemade from the hot dogs, sausages and hamburgers. You could tell the buns were homemade too, they were very fresh and perfectly toasted. 
Come here with a big appetite because the food is very filling. One hot dog  is more than enough to eat. The French fries and tater tots were crispy 
and yummy .
The Bloody Mary was made with Absolute Pepper and came with a slice of bacon and skewer of tater  tots. The drink was not very strong but good flavor. Not a huge selection of beers to choose from either by cans or on tap.
Service was friendly, fast and helpful. The interior of the restaurant is a really cool environment with high top seats."}
{"text":"Omg you got to try the Vegan Hot Dog!!!! I was very skeptical about coming here because I am Vegan, but then I saw the soy dog and decided to try it. I was so delighted by the presentation and flavor of the dog that you had to ask the girl if it was truly Vegan"}
{"text":"Juicy hot dogs, hot employees? What more could a college student want?!

For about three weeks, I watched Dog Haus get comfortable in the plaza where they decided to make their mark and drooled every time. I kept picturing what their food may be like in my head. Finally, yesterday, I decided to feed my inner beast.

Dog Haus is loud and rocking. The stainless steel interior and muted wood wainscoting makes you feel like you're walking into a rough and tumble junk yard. You're waiting for the dogs to come at you and they do, in all the sweetness a King Hawaiian roll can offer you.

Even accommodating the Vegan taste buds, Dog Haus has a relatively wide range of sausages, dogs and burgers for you to try. My German roots couldn't ignore the Pig Lebowski: Polish sausage, coleslaw, BBQ sauce and French fries. You're welcome to make your meal a combo which includes fries or tots and a drink. If you're a conossuier of chili cheeseness, they do have the option of adding those to your spuds. Try The Love Boat! That comes topped with ooey-gooey awesomeness with a mound of their sweet slaw finishing it off. My choice of entree was delicious, magnanimously flavorful with just the right about of spice. It helped that they were playing David Bowie on the radio.

If you're looking for a hangover cure or a cool joint to hang out at, Dog Haus is the place to go. With a little bar tucked away in the corner, you're able to choose from typical drafts to the daily special. Also, if you're a local, mention it to them in conversation and they may surprise you with a 10% discount."}
{"text":"Total Random stop after getting into town, the bestie & I were hungry driving to Vegas. Always pull up yelp for great spots, and she's good at it. Great menu, draft/ bottled beers & easy-chill environment.

I totally enjoyed the beef bacon wrapped hot dog, got the Old Town! Talk about delicious condiments on this dog from jalapeños, caramelized onions, tasty sauce with cojita cheese on top of a hawaiian roll. Couldn't stop there, so we ordered root beer battered mini corn dogs with chili cheese tots! What a great meal to have after driving in from Chandler, AZ."}
{"text":"When you walk in you order at a counter and then they bring your food to you. Didn't wait long at all.... Under 10 minutes. I ordered a build your own chicken sausage with lettuce, tomatoes, & spicy basil aioli. The aioli wasn't spicy at all but it was really good. The buns they use are Hawaiian rolls.... light and fluffy with a hint of sweetness. A little messy to eat but worth it. My husband ordered the old town dog which was a hot dog wrapped in bacon topped with jalapeños, onion, chipotle aioli, & cotija cheese. He loved it. We split an order of tots. Pretty basic, nothing special. Really didn't need them because the hot dogs are filling enough. Overall nice place to stop for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Employees were working slowly, talking about where they're going to get dinner for themselves.  Not many people there, but still took forever for the order.  The food was decent, but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"After spending the afternoon doing shots of something called \"Ass Juice\"at a bar, it was time to get some grub in us before taking on the rest of the evening.
So glad our buddy Nate suggested this place, it really did hit the spot.
The place looked clean and brand new with its industrial look. I was surprised by all the options to pick from, no just hot dogs but sausages , burgers and more on the menu.
 
I took down the \"Sooo Cali\" dog... I know how typical of me being from SoCal and all.
The hot dog with avocado and tomatoes was rad enough but what really nailed it was the bun.  The bun was not your typical old bun but a tasty Hawaiian roll.... bun.  Tried some of Nate's cheesy tots and sort of wished I had ordered some too.
Washed it all down with a cold beer and we were off into the night."}
{"text":"Love this place! Russell was so helpful and picked the perfect burger for my needs, he even gave me an order of fries! Yayyyyy"}
{"text":"Just yum! I finally went and tried the Freiburger which had the patty, an egg, white american cheese, house slaw, and french fries - right on the burger. It was so good! The flavor was really good, but I think my favorite part of the whole thing was it was layered on Hawaiian rolls which are known for being soft and sweet. I'm a huge burger lover, and this one lived up to my expectations. It was neither too big or too small. Even adding a side of fries (which my sister and I shared), I didn't feel overly stuffed. My total for everything was just over $8. We went during their happy hour, so a lot of their smaller plates were on the discounted menu (the fries), but he Freiburger was not. I'd been wanting to try it for some time, so there was no way I was going to pass it up."}
{"text":"The food was great for being our first time here we got the chili idol and the cowboy dogs, with an order of onion rings. We waited and saw our food come out but no one went to get our food I had to get up and get it. I asked for a side a ranch their ranch had no flavor and very liquidity. The cashiers seemed tired out of it. Will most definitely have to think about coming back"}
{"text":"Great service and the food was awesome. They use Hawaiian bread instead of buns on the burgers. The burger I had was cooked to perfection. They add seasoning salt to the fries which makes the meal a lot better. Great meal."}
{"text":"Awesomeness in its purest form.  Come hungry large portions and every bite will make you want more.  Very addicting!  Try the chocolate shake with your meal, very chocolaty! Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing. Had a few dogs and some really good drinks. The atmosphere was amazing and the food was delicious. This is a must go to, while on vacation or just around town."}
{"text":"This was awesome. I got the cheese fries and the hangover burger, and the ringer burger. The Hawaiian roll buns add that extra bit of delicious to the sandwiches. Will defiently be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I had a four hour layover in Vegas so left the airport and came to this little food place not too far from the Strip. I've never had a burger on top of Hawaiian Sweet Rolls before but this is how they serve their burgers! Being from Hawaii I love sweet rolls so I thought this was a pretty good idea and it was tasty! They do have vegetarian dogs and burgers which I appreciated and the food is not very pricey. I wished the fries were a bit thicker but if you like thin fries you'll get them here. They have all kinds of burger and hot dog items and it's a cool ambience and easy to find parking (which is free). I would come again!"}
{"text":"Dog Haus has a really good happy hour and very tasty sliders. Friendly service from the staff only sweeten the deal even more.

Happy hour runs from 3-6pm and there's a reverse late night happy hour as well. That means $1.25 sliders, fries, and tots plus $2 off beers on tap. Decent variety of beers on tap but nothing out of the ordinary. Still, with sliders this tasty, you'll find something cold to wash them down. The burger patties are juicy and well seasoned and work so well with the sweet Hawaiian rolls they're served in. So addictive that you can go though a whole lot of them in no time! 

Very friendly staff serve a mostly local clientele. If you're in the neighborhood, Dog Haus is a great spot to satisfy a burger craving."}
{"text":"OMG A MUST TRY! We're visiting here from Texas and was steered here from EVERYONE at Revolt tattoos. This place has fresh high quality food that tastes great. We did t get a photo because we ate everything up so fast. We both ordered Haus dogs. Even though I ordered he one with only chili and cheese it was he best darn dog I've ever had. We'll definitely go back. It's a must try when you're in Vegas! They have lots to choose from so you won't be disappointed. Their dogs are all natural beef. They also have turkey dogs and burgers and sliders. The tater tots and onion rings are great too."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick lunch while in the area today. Heard about this place opening a few months ago and wanted to try it but it was always out of the way. 

I have no previous experience with similar places besides buldolgi's which has been in town for years. 

I realized this location took over the old Johnny Rocket's spot which used to be here when i used to attend UNLV. 

Walking into the establishment, immediately to the right has a small bar with a few things on tap. Lots of bar stool tables on the side. 

This restaurant opens Haus Dogs (special all beef skinless dogs), Haus Sausages (hand crafted sausages), Haus Burgers (proprietary grind of chuck and brisket), sides, sliders, and desserts. Vegetarian styles available upon request. 

I had decided to try something \"standard\" (is that the right word) and went for the Das Brat. Dat Brat contains a bratwurst topped with sauerkraut, caramelized onions, and whole grain mustard aioli, all in a hawaiian dinner bread \"bun\". By the design of the hawaiian breads, the only thing i found cooking myself at home was they were amazing as slider buns. When split in half for anything else, they easily fall apart. And this was no exception. Dinner breads arent big to begin with. A bratwust is probably 2/3's its size. Topped with sauerkraut and onions, its almost impossible to eat this cleanly. Even before my first bite, the bread split off and left with with a \"whole\" dinner bread section with some saurkraut. That itself tasted amazing tho xD but who doesnt like hawaiian bread with anything. The sausage itself had a pretty good chewing texture with its casing. Flavor-wise, i wish it was a little more flavorful. For the price, and something so simple, i feel like i was overpaying for what i got. 

Maybe the other stuff they have offers more but nothing really stood out to me prior to ordering. Maybe i just dont know sausages... if u know what i mean hahaha"}
{"text":"GREAT FOR VEGETARIANS!! they have awesome veggie hot dogs and burgers. The tots are a little oily but that's to be expected in this type of restaurant. Would recommend for the vegetarian looking for a solid cheat meal :)"}
{"text":"The food was awesome ! Great staff , select beers on draft and small bar. Over all a great place to hang out and have drinks and some dogs... burgers are great also!"}
{"text":"The happy hour is incredibly affordable for sliders and tater tots. I got the turkey dog and it was delicious. I am a believer in the Hawaiian rolls  as a bun."}
{"text":"The food here is good, I keep coming back. Great shakes as well.  Don't forget to make your fries Love boat style. Super good"}
{"text":"So for everyone that comes to Vegas, this place is a little bit off the strip.. but it is really good and so cheap compared to the food in the strip! I was sober when I came too so it's not the drunkenness speaking. This place is delicious and cheap! We went to a pool party in the hard rock hotel and randomly went across the street in this whole in the wall place and it was the delicious!! I recommend the hangover burger!! It's delicious!!"}

{"text":"Had a great time! Food was great! Service was great! Perfect location for light munchies."}
{"text":"IGreat place to hang out have a beer and a delicious hot dog not to mention tater tots.the hotdog was everything I expected. 

It was there going to delicious toasted Hawaiian buns with bacon red peppers caramelized onions question me to jalapenos topped with Mayo ketchup and mustard. 

The meat was cooked to perfection and presentation was amazing. We both had a nice cold beer what are hot dogs. Friendly customer service even when our cashier left for the day she made sure to call and let him know you didn't give us happy hour. Which got us two more beers.
The AC was broken and it was pretty warm but non the less we loved this place and will return soon for some yummy grub!"}
{"text":"My wife and I discovered this place on Yelp a few months back and we are hooked. Great dogs and burgers that are out of this world. Very customizable, flavorful and the best part--they use sweet Hawaiian rolls for buns. The onion rings are also killer. Great service and the food never disappoints."}
{"text":"First time here, and I get a burger. LOL. I've wanted to try this place out for awhile, but a few days in row of having leftover bratwursts, I've gotta have something else. 
Customer service was awesome. Was greeted by several people right off the bat, and they didn't make fun of me for squinting and wearing shades at one point (light sensitive after laser eye surgery).Also appreciated the way our cashier walk around and check up on us and other patrons. Thanks for the recommendation of mixing the coconut stout and a cider! I'm trying to remember the name of the beers to mix at home in the future! 
The food was extremely delicious! Reminds me of good street food, only indoors =) I got the Little Mule (sliders), and the fiance got the Scott Baioli. Out of the two, I've gotta admit that his was better. I liked how spicey my sliders were, and the Hawaiian bread just cuts into the savory flavors perfectly."}
{"text":"Tonight I was craving something naughty with a gourmet twist. I avoid dairy and pork like the plague so the Sooo Cali dog with a side of tater tots was my choice: yum! A combination of some of my favorite things: arugula, avocado, and a spicy basil aioli. The King's Hawaiian was also a good look. Thanks Dog Haus for satisfying my craving!"}
{"text":"Best i ever had.  The menu is so diverse.  Something for everyone.  Wish I didn't have to lose weight, cause I'd be there every day!"}
{"text":"Meet meat ;)
New Dog Haus location Las Vegas is packed today on their opening day. 
Little Mule is the best Dog Haus burger!"}
{"text":"Dog Haus is easily a 4-star wiener joint, which is saying something in Las Vegas land-of-the-taco, but today was mightily disappointing in the adult beverage department. 

I asked to chase my Free Bird turkey sausage with the unique Hawaii-born coconut porter.

Denied.

How about the cider?

Rejected!  \"oh, I'm so sorry. Would you like to try...\" I notice not two, but FOUR beverages on tap are tapped out. Similar to the boozie overpriced and small shake had last time, disappointing. Water will have to do.

That sad exchange aside, the Polish kielbasa I had on my first visit was stellar. Real crunch to the outside, authentic seasoning on the inside, all lovingly held by an open Hawaiian bread which is grilled to perfection, bringing out the soft yet flavorful texture and taste of the oft-neglected bun.

And this time? My turkey 'dog was also aces---simple in execution, but the avocado and other fixings made it a filling spot. One burger slider to top it off, also a fine choice. 

Dog Haus is, for the most part, priced fair. I love the display case so you can see the fresh fixings you are ordering. The bar-like scene is bright yet somehow hotdog-rustic at the same time. I'll be back, for sure, with hopes I can have the full experience advertised."}
{"text":"This was such a pleasant surprise. Great price, great hamburger (had the little mule) and the sweet potato fries. Also the red hydrant Indian brown ale. The food was served quickly and so hot. The fried egg was right out of the pan. And the patty was juicy and flavorful.
All and all one of the best burgers in Vegas."}
{"text":"This dog and burger haus was a delightful surprise. We have been staying at the Hard Rock which is just across the street. My husband and I both ordered burgers which were fantastic! Everything is fresh and made fresh to order. The decor is urban / rustic and very cool. The staff is exceptionally friendly and professional which is not expected these days at a fast food place. very refreshing! This company must really take good care of their employees. Absolutely perfect service! Thank you Russell and staff for being awesome! Happy bellies here!"}
{"text":"This establishment had a great business model and execution. It didnt feel borrowed or anything it felt genuine and new. The food was good and filling. I did enjoy seeing the freshly made hot dogs and such in the cooler. The prices were ok, not to high or to low..wait is there a such thing as to low? 

Maybe not but its located inside a strip mall near The Thomas and Mack center. It was really clean and the employees were helpful and patient. 

Good Place."}
{"text":"Went there by accident when it first opened and left when I saw the prices. 6-8 bucks seemed a lot for a hot dog. Wife took me recently to try it as it had good reviews and I was a little hesitant but willing to try.

Turned out to be a good call as the food is excellent and much larger than you might think. For about 10 dollars you can get a hotdog meal that is unique, filling and very tasty.

I would recommend trying it if you are apprehensive, you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Late night eat is what had us coming to this place. Amazing food and amazing fast service. 
A new hotspot to try over and keep trying because they are that good!
Hot dogs are served on Kings Hawaiian bread and the combination of what came along with the hotdogs and the bread is heaven!
Two thumbs up and a definite recommendation to locals and visitors alike."}
{"text":"I love creative upscale dogs. I walked having seen the pictures and read dozens of the reviews. This is a place of promise but not execution. I asked for a recommendation from the person entering the order. I took the recommendation which was the Hang Over. It's a hamburger! Seriously? You are a hot dog shop and the best thing on the menu is a chili covered, egg added hamburger... yikes. Tots we're tasty but from a bag. At these prices I anticipated something from scratch. My nose was all that got scratched here and that is in confusion. I'm not likely to return. Sorry."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!! It was clean and the staff were super friendly! The lady that did the register also stopped by multiple times to check on us and also said goodbye as we left! I ordered the corn dog slider and could seriously taste the root beer in the root beer batter and it was surprisingly delicious!!!! The Hangover burger was so good the egg was nice and runny! Super messy and so good! I love that they use 4 Hawaiian rolls as the buns. The sweet balances perfectly with the sauce and burger patty! I also got the chili cheese tots and they were covered in the creamiest cheese sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Bought a hot dog on a Sunday night last week and threw it back up the next morning before school. I really love this place they have awesome burgers but now idk if I wanna go back if they serve old food."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Took them 45 minutes to bring out our orders and yet the bacon was served raw.  The employees here really shouldn't be working in good service, someone is bound to get sick. Wish I could give zero stars"}
{"text":"Clean resteraunt and friendly employees. We are off to a good start!

 The cashier asked me how I was doing then came around the counter to show me the hot dogs available and a few of the menu options. 

I order the Scott Bailoi, which was described as grilled onions, cheese, garlic ailoi and bacon crumbles. I also opted for the cheesy tots. 

They gave me a number on a stick to place on my table so I went to wash up, grab a drink and check some emails. After cleaning up my inbox I looked up wondering when they were going to bring the food out and noticed a lonely tray of food sitting up on the counter. I walked up and asked if it was mine and got \"yea, sorry\" as he continued to wipe down the counter. 

Whatever, let's give it a try.. very small dog wraped in a huge bun with a ton of cheese, oily diced onions, hard bacon crumbles and mayonaise. 

This spot would be the bomb if I was in college and drunk. SADLY, I am neither. I am a middle aged, blue collar guy looking for a quick lunch at a good value. (Hot dog, right??)

$12.00 bucks for a poor hot dog, pre-frozen tots with cheese sauce poured over them and drink is not my idea of a reasonable lunch which is why I can only assume they were dead slow at 12:30 on Wednesday.

Keep in mind, $12 bucks was after the \"locals discount\" I was told I was receiving and before the tip."}
{"text":"Kinda pricey for a hot dog, but really good and unique. Love the carmalized onions with Chipotle sauce in the old town dog."}
{"text":"Delish! I got the brat, and it was so good. I love how they use Hawaiian rolls for their buns. It makes it that much \"extra.\" I also got the tots, which were great. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome stuff! Come here if you never have and try everything on the menu. Amazing staff and customer service is always their main priority. We're from California so our usual Dog Haus visit is in Pasadena however this location was none lacking as for presentation and customer service. 

Ordered 3 burger sliders and 2 hot dog sliders with some tater tots. Delicious as always, my only reason behind my rating was my girlfriends input on how she preferred Pasadena over this location. 

Regardless, this place is a must! Great job as always Dog Haus, we shall see you soon!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today, came in right when they opened. Got the Old Town Dog, Pig Lebowski, Little Mule burger and Love Boat with tots (I was here with other people... didn't eat all this alone...although I probably could have!!) Everything was really good, the sausage had great flavors, the BBQ sauce and slaw that came on top of the sausage were a great combination. The place is spacious, officers alcoholic beverages, nice and clean. 

It is a better deal to pick from one of the options the already created, making your own dog will most likely cost way more since each topping costs anywhere from .70-1.50$. 

The only small hiccup was that they weren't quite ready when they opened, there wasn't ice in the soda machine and the bathroom did have papers. But it was not a big deal at all! 

Overall, great flavors and reasonably priced!!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with Dog Haus two years ago and have been comparing all the dogs I eat to the standard they set ever since. I begged them to open a Vegas location, and finally they granted my wish! Unfortunately, my favorite (the Pig & the Fig) didn't make the Vegas menu, but don't let that stop you from finding your favorite!

SOOO CALI: The spicy basil aioli is amazing, but the avocado and crispy onions give it great texture too! A fun explosion of fresh flavors. 
RESERVOIR DOG: a kicked-up take on your usual chili dog, with slaw and mustard, was my guy's favorite. Heads up, the chili is spicier than expected!
SCOTT BAIOLI: I got this for the garlic aioli and caramelized onions but was underwhelmed. Sauce didn't have much flavor, felt like the choice of cheese didn't really fit the other flavors. 
THE COWBOY: bacon, white American cheese, onions, and bbq sauce somehow didn't come together for the wild ride I'd anticipated. 
SIDES/SHAKES: Vanilla shake was super-thick, I hear the salted caramel version is even better. Tots and fries are crispy and salted, add cheese sauce if you're not concerned about a coronary. 

Even on busy opening day, service was friendly and organized. The industrial decor and hard-rock music give this spot a fun identity. Heads up, your vegetarian friends can enjoy the food too: they offer a vegetarian hot dog AND two different veggie sausages!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place to me while I was in Cali. Soooo glad they finally opened one in Vegas. The line here wasn't as long as the one in Burbank."}
{"text":"This is truly a fabulous spot. It's modern, casual, and hip in it's decor and ambiance. The menu is fairly extensive, but not too too overwhelming. Prices are reasonable. They have happy hour specials. There are multiple beer, wine, and cocktail offerings. They have adult milkshakes and regular milkshakes. 

You order at the counter, receive a number to put on your table, and then your food is brought to you. You can create your own or order from a variety of their creations. They have hot dogs (duh), sausages, burgers, sliders, fries, tater tots, and onion rings.

We ordered the Scott Baioli dog (smoked bacon, white american cheese, garlic aioli, caramelized onions) and The Love Boat (fries or tots with chili and cole slaw). Seriously delicious! It was hot dog perfection. All high-quality ingredients. The dog was perfectly cooked. The bun was great. Everything about it was stellar. The fries were so yum too. The chili had a wonderful flavor. It reminded me of Ben's Chili Bowl in DC. And the cole slaw was perfect. I'm not usually a fan cole slaw, but it was darn tasty. 

All the staff were very nice and friendly. Tip: Locals can get a card that gives you 10% off. It's definitely worth a trip here. I'm already craving another hot dog and more chili fries."}
{"text":"OMG, They have the best sausage in town!! The people who work their are very nice. I will be back again and try others things in their menu. I hope they open a location in Henderson."}
{"text":"Very upset it's not in the Bay Area . My boyfriend and I are here the other day and from the food to the customer service.... AWESOME. Highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Dope little burger joint got a variety of choices from the classic to their very own specialty. I've tried the sliders which comes with an angus beef, mayo, American cheese, and Carmelized onions. Best part about it is they grill it in front of you. The place has a nice little mini bar so you can enjoy a couple cold ones while waiting on your food. Oh and they have happy hour."}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles and so have been enjoying these hot dogs for years. When I found out there is now a Vegas location, I was ecstatic! I got my usual So Cali Dog and tasted just like the ones from back home. Hands down best hot dog and corn dog I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Soooooo Goooood! My Daughter HATES Burgers Doesn't Matter What Kind & I Had Her Try \"The Hangover\" & She LOVED It & She Will Not Stop Asking For Another! Lol"}
{"text":"This place is too amazingly good, the fries are perfectly crispy, the burgers are just full of flavor! I would suggest the ringer or the hangover burger! Burgers might be 10-12 dollars but I'm telling you it's worth the money. This spot is now in my top 5 favorites in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"The Dog Haus seemed clean and the staff went out of their way to be friendly and help with my order. That's a big plus in my book. They also checked on me a couple of timers to see if I needed anything. 

I ordered the Das Brat, a hot and juicy brat well prepared with the toppings. The roll it was served on was a good surprise. Freshly toasted on the grill and tasty. It was a good brat, with a little different spice than I usually see. I liked it, but like traditional seasoning better. It was a nice lunch. Come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love eating here when your not on a budget and looking to only feel your stomach half way lmao. 
It a hot dog place and they do a great job making it into a joint for different kind of eaters. Love coming here when I get hot dog cravings and there beverage selection sucks but I do recommend it to people who want something outside the box."}
{"text":"So after 10min in line it took 30min for me to get my food. Oh and it turns out my food was done 10min prior to that, they just forgot to bring it out or give any indication that this was my food. And in addition to cold food, the bottom side of the bun was completely scorched... this place sucks, don't go"}
{"text":"My boyfriend was craving hotdogs, so instead of the usual Sams club polish hotdogs, we thought to give this place a try. Service is quick. Lots of options. My eyes went straight to the \"so Cali\". Sounded amazing but didn't taste as amazing as I thought it would be. The sauces they have are delicious though, I believe are homemade. They use Hawaiian sweet rolls instead of hot dog buns and I guess they're going for the sweet and savory but I really think the Hawaiian buns takes away the goodness of the sausage itself and the rest of the toppings. My boyfriend ordered the downtown dog which is a bacon wrapped dog, and he said it was nothing special and also didn't like the overpowering of the Hawaiian roll. The chili cheese tots are yummy though. The tots are nicely fried and crispy and golden brown. The chili is good too. Honestly, I would highly recommended to order one of the specialty sausages they have which was our mistake. We just had an all beef dog which taste the same everywhere in our opinion. But they have like polish, and veal and pork dogs."}
{"text":"Another bad experience here at the dog haus.  This is my absolute last time ever coming here.  Ordered the soooo Cali dog. Awful, too much shit on it to even eat like a hot dog.  The sausage was even bad too.  Took forever to get my two dogs and was very disappointed.  Manager didn't give a shit about me not liking the food.  Can't recommend this place to anyone.  God awful all around."}
{"text":"I had the sooo cali super good. Just came back again had the old town dog if u like hot spicy food this is got a good kick.I will be back again for sure"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! I got the downtown dog and I don't even think I chewed my food it was so good!!! I cannot wait to go back, the service was fantastic and quick as well! Great job Dog Haus!"}
{"text":"My son & I ordered the hangover burger, cheese tots & each a shake... vanilla shake with chocolate drizzle & salted Carmel.  We were just trying to try something new but we are blown away!!! We will be back!  Amazing service & the Hawaiian sweet rolls on the burgers omg such a yummy touch!!!"}
{"text":"It was amazingly good.
Good get away from the strip life.
Your mind will be blown.
They use kings Hawaiian rolls for their buns."}
{"text":"Second time to this place and I gotta say it rocks!... Literally. Their always cranking great music :-). I stumbled on the place and what a find! Not only is their selection of dogs delicious, but their staff is so cool and very friendly.

There is something for everyone here,  including veggie dogs. They also do burgers too. I suggest picking something from their list... You wont go wrong. If you catch them 3-6 they have 2 for craft beers. I find myself attracted to this place everytime I'm in the area."}
{"text":"What better time to try this place other than the start of national hot dog month! This place won't disappoint! Tried their signature \"sooo cali\" dog and it was soo goood! This item included avocado which is my winning ingredient. Also tried \"old town dog\" that's bacon wrapped.... but wait it gets better... all these Dogs aren't in hot dog buns, they're in Texas toast buns! So yummy and filling. Their menu has so much variety from their signature dogs or you can create your own. Don't want hot dogs? No problem they have burgers too and I'm sure they're just as delicious. This place also stays open until 4am which is awesome for Vegas! Can't wait to come back and try more menu items!"}
{"text":"This place took over the space where Johnny rockets was. There is another hot dog place across the street but this one was finished being built first. I didn't actually make it to this one until after going to the other across the street first, though. I feel they are going to start a cross street rivalry like many single stop shops do on the east coast which, ironically, both of these places originate from...the east coast. (I stand corrected. The owner was cool enough to point out that DogHaus is NOT from the east coast....so, it's more like a east/west rivalry, lol)

Ok, so onto the review. I rolled up late and by myself. After midnight and after a long night out. Cool atmosphere, low lights and funky music on. Good seating area. Reminds me of east coast seating with long raised slim style table like a bar with stools positioned adequately spaced apart. Televisions on each row of seats.

Now the food and service...service was nice. The girl was friendly, knowledgeable and smiling. It's always kind of hard going into a new place where they have numerous unique creations because I always want to read all of the ingredients to see which one sounds the most tantalizing but I feel like a dweeb sitting there reading every single one. So, to keep the excitement moving, I usually just ask which is the most popular. The girl pointed out a few. I think this is the best way. If the best is good enough, I'll come back and have a little better idea of what to order and how to order while having more confidence from feeling like a dweeb. 

Now, this place has more options of dogs or sausages and kielbasa, etc. ( fun names btw ). I got the Pig Lebowski. The sausage was great. Perfectly cooked with just enough snap from the casing from well made charcuterie. Good flavor. The toppings were tasty but actually kind of took away from the sausage, in my opinion. Was piled on a little too much. It has Cole slaw, fries and pickles with a dark sweet sauce. These are all good but being a premium sausage, I was almost tempted to wipe off the toppings and eat the sausage plain. Like I said, the sausage was great which almost made the toppings seem unnecessary. And it was a lot to eat. With the combo of drink and choice of fries and tater tots, one dog was plenty to fill me."}
{"text":"I loved the service here! The lady that took our order was so sweet. The food was amazing! We came during happy hour and the sliders, fries, and tots were half off."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here this morning and not only did it get here quick, the food is amazing!!! I saw all the reviews and thought, it can't be that good I mean people always say something's good but I don't always agree... however these people put love into their food you can taste it! Will definitely be ordering from here again"}
{"text":"Ended up eating here earlier tonight and their food was delicious! I like how their bread is Hawaiian rolls instead of typical bread. They had flavorful tater tots and a huge selection of entrees. They also have happy hour every day. Check out my pictures for the happy hour schedule. The workers were all very friendly and the ambiance was family friendly! Food was pretty inexpensive and we will definitely come back next time we are back in vegas!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot!  Awesome choices, happy hour, drafts and lots of things with bacon.  Easy ordering and a very nice place to chill and eat. Monthly specials to keep you coming back and trying new things."}
{"text":"Maybe since I ate there late in the evening,  the sausage and beef hotdogs I ordered were so burned and chard on the outside made it immpossibke to eat.  Could not bite them.  Was not even close to being worth the price.   The two for 3.00 dogs at the gas stations are much better"}
{"text":"I've been twice for lunch when I was in the area. I can't remember what I had the first time but this time I had one of the bratwursts and onion rings. Everything was great. My only complaint is charging 8 bucks just for the brat. I guess it's close to the strip which makes things pricier and it seems to be the going rate for gourmet hot dogs (dirt dog is pretty much the same price) but it still seems crazy they charge essentially ball park prices."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Hard Rock across the street and looking for a lunch place with good food that wasn't super expensive, and this place was perfect. Even though the menu has named hot dogs with certain toppings, you can really pick whatever dog type and toppings you want. I got a brats dog with spicy brown mustard, tomatoes, uncooked onions, and jalapeños and it was really good. 
Service is super nice and friendly. I was wondering aloud how the coleslaw was and they offered to let me try it first. So nice!  (It was really good btw). They also have various milkshakes on the menu that sound really good but I didn't try any of them on this visit. Atmosphere is casual but nice and clean, with a bunch of large high top tables and some regular tables for 2 and 4 people. Was a great find!"}
{"text":"Only ever had bad service here once but the food is always great and most times the staff is on it. Great value/fun vibe. Highly recommend hitting it up."}
{"text":"This alternative hot dog place is much more memorable than most fast food establishments.  The modern decor, the cool names for their food items, and the prices were very memorable.  As a new customer, I was helped in my choice making by the staff and it was much appreciated because the suggestion was very tasty and fully flavorful with its sauce and creative combinations of additions."}
{"text":"I love dogs, and this place hits the spot... Don't be afraid to put the 'kitchen sink' on your dog... Mine had bratwurst, grilled onions, sauerkraut, and I had pastrami and and an egg added... Tasted awesome !!!! I  think the prices are reasonable and you get a good product.   I will definitely be back !!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  We came here on a whim after a difficult flight to Vegas.  I am so glad we did.

Food is freshly prepared, tasty and always filling.  I love that they use those yummy little King's Hawaiian sweet buns to house the dogs.  Super creative :)  For those that enjoy variety or do not like to eat as much, they have \"mini\" versions of the hot dogs which are 1 Hawaiian bun size vs. the normal serving size which is 3 Hawaiian buns.

They offer multiple hot dogs and sausages that you can sub in to any of the menu offerings :)

What we got:

- Chili dog- sub REAL cheddar cheese for that nasty artificial nacho cheese (LOL yuck), fresh onions and \"Haus\" chili.  SO YUM.  All-beef hot-dog is a must get and is super yummy.
- Root-beer battered corn dog- I was not able to taste the root beer, but this corn dog was pretty tasty!!
- Fries- have been hit or miss the times that we have been here.  It has been good/okay about 50% of the time.  You won't miss them if you don't get them.

UberEats delivers, but it is not the same as being in the store.  Service is very friendly and you can tell that the staff really cares for the customers.  I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Read about the Dog Haus in the Las Vegas weekly and I had to try it out tonight after work. $1.25 for these amazing sliders is a steal. I have found a new late night happy hour staple!! 1am to 4am is just my hours. Well one is a corn dog dipped in the house made root beer batter, which is different and fantastic. One is a hot dog with cheese & bacon and both the slider & dog are served on sweet Hawaiian rolls. Coming back soon and often. The chef was also a super friendly gentleman!"}

      I will be returning asap! Last but not least the value for my money!"}
{"text":"Very good food. The serving size is pretty big but nothing too daunting. The prices are pretty fair. Bread isn't just tasteless extra either, it has a nice taste. There are also a LOT of toppings that you can put on and they even have some custom sauces. The Sooo Cali is really good!"}
{"text":"A great place for hotdogs Corn dogs and sliders. 

This place is great. The quality of the meat is amazing. I don't usually like hot dogs but this is my go to spot for hot dogs and burgers now. Go at happy hour when sliders are super cheap like $1. 

They use toasted Hawaiian sweet roll as the bun for the burgers and hotdogs and they taste amazing. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed the hot dog beef and the hamburger meat it just tastes so good. 

The milkshakes are awesome too I love the caramel milkshake and the prices are very reasonable. 

To sum this up this is a great place to grab hot dogs and fries tots and milkshakes. I love the hamburger sliders as well."}
{"text":"Omg. One bite! Goes on my list of top ten burgers. I had the cheeseburger, lettuce wrapped. No bun needed. Definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"As good as the food might off  end up being!! I just think that for a fast food place! The waiting its ridicules 45min still waiting for a chicken burger! Not happy , had to ask for my money back..an leave hungry an upset! Never stepping in this place again!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! This place isn't as close as all the other hot dog places on the strip but it is well worth the trip. All the other places are charging upwards of $5 for plain hotdogs. For the same price here you can get amazing dogs with all sorts of combinations and choices. The tatter tots are fine. Nothing extraordinary. However the seasoning on the fries are great! I couldn't get enough. The basic beef dog and the bacon wrapped dog are both delicious. They were even so nice and grilled the beef dog to a more well finish for one of us. The place looks cool and is clean. The staff are really friendly and look like they're having a good time. Coming again for sure."}
{"text":"Staying across the street at the Hard Rock recently, I got tired of the in-casino options for dining (not that they're not good, mind you). My buddy and I sauntered over to the Haus to check out the action. Dog Haus has a very crazy menu, with lots of creative options. I opted for the Fonz, and it did not disappoint. Great flavor, plenty of food (yes, the tots are the tits), and surprisingly decent liquor and beer selection. My only reason for not leaving a 5th star is that the food is RIDICULOUSLY salty. I swole up like a woman in her 3rd trimester after binging potato chips. And that's saying something, because I'm a guy. But yes, the food is very, very delicious, and greasy enough to soak up the hangiest of hangovers."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, good beer, awesome customer service. Every time I come here I leave satisfied and full. The staff is so friendly and always treats us like family. Elizabeth always goes above and beyond any time we see her."}
{"text":"It might be called Dog Haus but the burgers are the stars of the show here.  We came in for a late lunch and ordered a classic corn dog, chili cheese dog, pastrami burger, onion rings, cheese fries and chocolate shake.  The burger was one of the best I have ever had.  Seriously.  We wished we had ordered another burger.  I was disappointed in the corn dog.  I love corn dogs and was excited about the root beer batter but it was nothing special.  Cheese fries and rings were good as was my chocolate shake.  I think would get tots next time though."}
{"text":"I really like that they use Hawaiian sweet rolls as their buns!  It makes me eat the whole thing!

The Holy Aioli is amazing!  The patty is juicy and flavorful. It contrasts well with the sweet taste of the rolls. Their beer battered onion rings is a good side that compliments well with the burger. Cool it off with a cold fountain Coca Cola, and you have the perfect meal!

I've never tried their shakes, spiked or not. But I'll definitely think about it next visit!

Recommended for casual hang outs!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for helping me find Dog Haus. 

First off, the dogs themselves are great. Cooked to perfection with the right amount of snap and spiced just right. 

Oh the use of grilled Hawaiian rolls is fantastic. Not sure the rolls are actually King's Hawaiian rolls, (hope they are). They're reminiscent of the type of bread used in lobster roll. Good and different choice. 

First time here, we ran through the following:

Cowboy dog-grilled bun, dog with American cheese, BBQ sauce and crispy onions. Sweet and sticky. A little too sweet for me. Would have preferred a tangier sauce.  Crispy onions are a nice topper. 

Little leaguer-good 'ol chili dog with cheese and onions. Solid. This will be put in the rotation. 

Turkey dog-my kids ate the whole thing so I give it a third party thumbs up. 

Fires and onion rings-cooked correctly. Nice normal fries. The rings were bite through. Which means the onion didn't pull out of the batter on that first bite. 

Chocolate shakes-very good. Not overly sweet. Solid. 

Ambience-clean, nice, industrial, cool and hip. Good friendly service. 

This dog rules the Haus."}
{"text":"After eating this I wish i had this restaurant back home in Austin I would eat it all the time! Their veggie dog is the absolute best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Just ordered two items to go:

Old Town Dog (really delicious)
Love Boat (very tasty but too small for the price)"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch.  I'm not a big fan of burgers, but in the absence of a chicken sandwich, I went with the Holy Aioli burger.  WOW!!  Great burger!!  You gotta check this place out.  Good atmosphere.  Good service."}
{"text":"Dog Haus has some very flavorful and customizable dogs! My goodness the flavors were on point and just what I wanted. The bun they put it on is just delicious and makes your mouth water. 

The chili fries were also incredible flavor packed and had you going back for more. You can change the type dog to your liking from veggie, Turkey, bacon wrapped, etc. Make it the way you want! I was very impressed."}
{"text":"We were recommended this place by a local and we didn't think we would like it but still gave it a try.
We absolutely loved it. We will be returning every single time we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Omg by far one of the best restaurants I've eaten at in vegas !!! Ordered onion rings and a corn dog and omg  amazing !!!! Place was spotless and staff was friendly! I will definitely return... hey they are open late too !!!"}
{"text":"This is the best food on earth! How have I never had this in my life until Now. Great staff. Amazing good. This is heaven"}
{"text":"My big thing while here this time around is finding grub that is AFFORDABLE. This place fit the bill and was delicious to boot. If you're trying to cure your Vegas hangover with some fried food look no further. Boyfriend had a bacon wrapped hotdog on a Hawaiian role bun with the works and I got a few sliders with onion rings and our meal was incredibly affordable (especially for Vegas)."}
{"text":"On our last night in Vegas we walked over to try this place which is across the street from the Hard Rock. Casual order at the counter and they deliver your food to the table. My husband ordered an Old Town dog that is bacon wrapped w pickled jalapeños & chipotle aioli & caramelized onions. I ordered the Ringer burger that has bacon, onion rings & BBQ sauce. Both were yummy & served on grilled Hawaiian rolls. My kids had kids meals one with (2) beef sliders and one with (2) corn dogs with tater tots & drink. They liked their meals. All this and a beer for about $35 (with tip). Plenty of food, very filling. The kids meals has a full size drink and tater tots. Overall a great place if you're wanting hot dogs, burgers, or sausages."}
{"text":"Not only the presentation, but the quality and taste of this food is 10/10...and it's difficult for me to say that, I am the pickiest eater."}
{"text":"i love their sliders..the mini hot dog and tater tots are pretty good too..great customer service and they're open late."}
{"text":"I feel not-so-secretly hostile towards hot dog restaurants that don't serve veggie dogs. Lucky for me, Dog Haus does! 

I picked my own toppings -- garlic aioli, onions, & a fried egg. Veggie dog had a good flavor but didn't have that satisfying *snap* Dog Haus piles it all on  toasted & buttered King's Hawaiian rolls -- a unique take on the traditional, boring hot dog bun. 

As long as I have the option to order a veggie dog, I'd come back to indulge in an Old Town Dog or Corn Dog. 

Open late, a decent alternative to tacos at 3am."}
{"text":"On my first visit, I have no cause for complaints. Food was amazing, and the customer service was spot on! I ordered the Downtown combo and customized my tater tots, let me tell you this was the best dressed dog I've had in a long time. A great vibe, and awesome for tourist and locals. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Hot dogs, beer? Yes, please! Friendly staff, great food. I was offered a sample of a milk shake and, good grief, had I not been so full, I'd have ordered one. Save room for that! Next time!"}
{"text":"Our 1st time and were we impressed. Food is awesome.  We had theFONZ. and a Holi Aioli."}
{"text":"Hot dogs r on point. Discovered this place in Pasadena? two days ago and went again as soon as I got BK to town. I have done the ringer down town dog corn dog(the best ever period) the cowboy dog very good wit the fried onions. Also had the hangover and the holy aioli burgers. LA location was trendy with a patio this Vegas spot is whatever just like Johnny rockets before it mediocre and over priced real estate."}
{"text":"Lunch the other day. Had a Scott Baioli (smoked bacon, white American cheese, garlic aioli, caramelized onions) and a Reservoir Hog (Polish kielbasa, haus chili, haus slaw, yellow mustard). They were pretty good, but maybe I had too much going on on my Scott Baioli - seemed the flavors got a bit muddled. Also, my dog could've been a little warmer - it was warm, but maybe I was expecting hot, like right off the grill hot. Would like to try it again, maybe with simpler stuff on it, to see if I can taste the meat better. The buns were interesting - more like little rolls connected."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS.
Oh, you want more? Most say I talk too much.
How have I never eaten a burger or a hotdog on a toasted Hawaiian bun!?! 
IT IS UNICORN MAGIC.
I tried a build your own sausage and burger creation because the voices in my head said - \"eat up, Tubby\".
Btw- the burger was exceptional. 
YUMMO."}
{"text":"Best hot dog I have ever had. So many options... And their chili is a delight for foodies across America, lol. 
The staff was helpful for me, since I was a first timer.. Food came out fast, no complaints here. A must see/eat when you visit. Not far from strip."}
{"text":"Get the Hangover, and do not spoil it by eating with utensils. Just devour that burger. Oh Yah!!"}
{"text":"It was ok
Service was slow to place order & get our food
Guy at the counter was nice & polite

Had fries also which were seasoned well, could have been slightly crisper.  Still excellent..

Beer selection is run of the mill.    No dry cider, and the beers are your normal California suspects.  

Manager and bartender were super friendly and informative...


Will be back. Fire the mammaluke in charge of beer and  Hire a Cicerone and up your beer Game is only complaint."}
{"text":"BOMB BOMB BOMB! Wowww. I hope this place never shuts down. One of the best \"bad food for you\" food in Vegas. I hope they open more of these in town... definitely recommended the little mule. Soooo good!"}
{"text":"As far as Hot Dogs go... This is the best in Las Vegas, IMO.  What makes it, (as you've read from other reviewers), is the King's Hawaiian Sweet Rolls that they use. It compliments the wide array of dog items in their menu, splendidly!  I especially like that the dogs are hormone and anti-biotic free.

I came here with my 12 year old, and he too was impressed. Though it was a little too much food for him, (which is fine since we saved it for later), cause I kinda went crazy for the two of us on the ordering. We had an order of the chili cheese tots, my son had a chili dog, (not on the menu but they were accommodating to make it for us), the Sooo Cali, and a small cheese burger. All were amazing and cooked perfectly.
The service and time between ordering and receiving were great, as well!  

Now, keep in mind that the portions are pretty generous and this is not for anyone who is dieting or on a Keto or paleo diet, (though you can just order a sausage or  a dog with no bun). But should you have a cheat day and don't know where to go, come here. It will be worth the extra work afterwards to put your body in that ketogenic state after consuming this goodness...

 I do plan on coming back and trying other dogs and maybe just a brat just by itself with mustard...! Either way, I recommend this place and hope that you have an awesome eating experience, as we did!"}
{"text":"My third experience with The Mule and I think I'm in love - especially now that i know how to keep it from falling apart after the second bite without having to use special burger gripping techniques from the Internet. The burger comes with a super yolky fried egg, cojita cheese, American cheese, an aioli, and jalapeños,  BUT They let you make substitutions for items in the same price range. Since I don't love American cheese but do love onions, I asked for crispy onions instead, made it a combo and, even though I showed up famished, I still had leftover fries.

 My dining companion went with the old town dog, a favorite of hers that comes wrapped in bacon with jalapeños, cojita, aioli, and caramelized onions, and cheesy fries. Haven't tried the old town but it sounds right up my alley. The cheese on the cheesy fries are more like a queso dip style cheese. Good cheese, I just prefer the plain."}
{"text":"the little league and the burger sliders were sooo good. the pilsner was nice and cold. Cool place"}
{"text":"A five-star hot dog places, seriously.

I've been here twice now and both times oddly happened after a visiting the Double Down Saloon, I guess Assjuice makes you hungry? If that drink reference goes over your head, you should probably leave the burbs more often. 

The Dog Haus, a Cali based restaurant with a laid back feel and professionally built hot dogs. On my first visit I went with the Downtown Dog stacked with smoked bacon, caramelized onions, pickled peppers, mayo, mustard and ketchup. Flavor bombasaurus! So good, so messy and so satisfying, you will be full after eating this dog. 

The second go around was a total sausage fest, The Pig Lebowski was calling my name and so were the extra carbs that accompanied it. A Polish kielbasa with coleslaw, bbq sauce and topped with french fries! The crunchy coleslaw mixed with spicy BBQ was so good and the kielbasa has perfect snap when I chomped into it. 

What makes this place so amazing is the use of Hawaiian Sweet Rolls as the buns instead of the traditional roll or pretzel roll. The bread is super soft molds to the dog instead of falling apart and creating a mess. The dog may take a little longer than normal, but everything is made fresh to order and come out piping hot, it's worth the wait.  

Beers, brats, and smothered tots. Please sir, may I have some more?!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service lots of choices, decent prices. Dogs were different tasting than what I am used to (Nathan's or Sabretts) my kids weren't fans but I'm totally up for trying more things out. We went on Weds and sliders and sides were half priced for happy hour (before 6 I think). My husband LOVED their unsweet Tea. My kids got a kick out of watching planes fly overhead and the toys were well received."}
{"text":"Tater tots are so crispy!! Pretty consistent in flavour and appeal to the shop in LA. Must try!"}
{"text":"This place will not disappoint you. I have eaten hotdogs all over the states and Mexico.  This place beats them all. The food is excellent and the service was great.  Definitely will be going back and bringing friends."}
{"text":"I thought I had tasted every type of burger around, but I was wrong. I love the unique style of sliders this restaurant offers. I had the burger with mushrooms and onions, and it was very satisfying. The fries were good too. I hope to come back here regularly to explore the menu."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place and I finally did, and loved it. I got the Sooo Veggie (sausage). Was amaaaazing and the fries were good too. My friend thought they were cold, but to me, they may have been room temperature. However, most fries are not good once cold. These were still good. Next time I want to try the Loco Moco with a veggie patty"}
{"text":"This may be one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. I know, I know, it's not a buffet. But the staff was kind. The restaurant was clean. And the food was delicious. I'm pretty sure the hours at this location are better than the one near me in California."}
{"text":"Got the mini sliders during happy hour and they were delicious and cheap. Also very friendly service for late night dining."}
{"text":"Don't be perturbed bc the name has 'dog' in it. This is so much more than a hot dog joint. The menu boasts eight interesting sausage combos, plenty of dogs, sliders, burgers, chicken sammies and draught brews. I was eyeing Das Brat (bratwurst, caramelized onions, sauerkraut, spicy brown mustard) bc I'm a bit of a purist, but instead went with some happy hour specials (half off sliders, tots, drink specials) bc I'm also a cheapist. With the special (3-6pm, 10pm-4am), two cheeseburger sliders, two dog sliders (with cheese and bacon), tots and a drink ran just over $8. This was a lot of food for one man, though I was up fat, I mean, for, the task and ended up enjoying all of it. The tots were super crispy, the burgers cheesy and juicy, and those lil dawgs were thick and perfect with a little mustard on top of that cheese (yes, I am gross). Would love for this Haus to be closer to my local watering hole here in NY!"}
{"text":"seriously great! Hawaiian buns for burgers you can't go wrong I got the little mule and it was delicious. The tater tots were great and so were the onion rings. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Excellent hot dogs at a very reasonable price. Lots of topping options. Order at the counter, get your drink, and wait for yummy goodness to arrive. I got the Downtown Dog, bacon wrapped with ketchup, mustard, mayo, caramelized onions, and red peppers. Great buns (no pun intended) round out a way above average weiner."}
{"text":"Walked over from the Hard Rock Hotel for a late dinner. Good choice on my part. Had the bacon wrapped dog with jalapeño and chipotle aioli and onions. Tasty with just the right level of heat. Went very well with the double Dutch chocolate shake. I have already recommended this place to several people. It is a fun alternative to the many overpriced options in Vegas."}
{"text":"Dog Haus has been bookmarked on my Yelp for who knows how long. I was on a recent stay-cation with some friends that came into town to celebrate the New Year and we stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino which just happens to be right across the street. I personally am not really a fan of much of the food options that the Hard Rock has to offer so my friends and I ventured out while staying there and I saw the sign for Dog Haus and just had to stop by to finally see what the hype was about.

When we arrived it was on a Friday night so I was expecting there to be a bit of a wait which it was but nothing too major. After previewing the menu prior to arriving I was already sold on the \"Old Town\" haus dog which consisted of  smoked bacon wrapped dog, caramelized onions, chipotle aioli, pickled jalapeños, cotija cheese and a side of chili cheese fries. After I ordered they gave me a number to bring with me back to the table. 

Cool thing about this place is they have a bar you can utilize while you wait! They offer both dine in and take out orders so having a drink in the meantime always is a good idea! I noticed while I was waiting the sign that advertised a happy hour which is another plus! Mon-Fri 3PM-6PM...\"Late Night\" 10PM-4AM and \"Sunday Funday\" 11AM-4AM. I'll have to be back to see how they are during one of those time frames. 

My overall thought of the haus dog was that it was okay. I think that the concept that they have here with serving the hotdogs on Hawaiian bread rolls is different and can set them apart from any other hot dog place but I just didn't get that WOW omg factor from it. I know they offer like an upgrade or something you can do so maybe next time i will do that to get the taste out of the basic category. Same thing with the chili fries they were just meh for $5.99. I think I might just have to try a different type of haus dog or even one of the haus sausages or even one of the burgers."}
{"text":"Food was very creative and tasty. They used Hawaiian sweet rolls instead of standard buns. 

My delivery included a 20% coupon off my next order, just because. 

Definitely going to order again! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my Vegas bucket list. I got the combo with fries and they were nothing special. I ordered the Another night in Bangkok because it was 115 degrees outside and pastrami didn't seem appealing in the heat. 
The spicy sausage was packed with flavor. The peanuts added the perfect crunch. The coleslaw wasn't too sweet or tangy, it was a prefect topping to cool your mouth. I would buy the sausage to just throw on the grill. If you are a fan of Yardhouse Spicy Thai pizza order this! 
The cashier was pleasant and patient."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place for some great late night eats! 

Stopped by cause it was the only good looking place open late at night, and boy am I glad I did. First visit we took our food home, and the to-go boxes reminded me of classic food dives from my hometown in Cali. Any place that can replicate that nostalgic feeling gets a bonus star in my book.

As for the food, it was fantastic! The Bad Mutha Clucka is a beast of a chicken sandwich and you can't go wrong with $1.25 sliders! Plus their shakes are simply divine, so don't be afraid to try one (totally recommend salted caramel).

All and all, wish the price was a bit more budget friendly, but for the quality, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Actually shocked of all the 5 star reviews. $16 dollars for a chili dog, chili cheese fries, and a drink. My buddy got the burger and tots. We both agree the sweet roll for a bun just doesn't do it for us. There were two females inside screaming and yelling at each other and I'm not quite sure if they were just having a dialog or actually fighting. No one asked them to keep it down or kicked them out though. 
   So this last two week we tried 4 \"gourmet\" style hot dog joints and I have to admit they were all over priced. It's a hot dog, Nathan's hot dogs are about $.78 each add the $.50 bun, 6 oz of chili. Maybe they should take a trip down to Windy City and check their prices.."}
{"text":"Even though the hot dog were really good, only reason I'm giving it a 4 star rating is because the prices were a little price for hotdogs."}
{"text":"Awesome food, VERY unique flavors. Staff was incredibly friendly, especially for Vegas. Tried a few of their cocktails too, was really impressed! I'll be back next time in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"TURN AROUND AND RUN. Marylyn Manson looking guy NOT washing his hands, as I watched him touch money, wipe his nose, then handle more food. The little Chinese guy who took my money is drunk. I sat there and waited 41 minutes for my food; THANK GOD I did, because it gave me a chance to see why I shouldn't eat their food. Nor should anyone else. THE BETTER NEWS? After I waited long enough to lose my appetite, my bacon was raw. And I mean RAW. not undercooked; FUCKING RAW. PINK. WITH COLD FAT....LIKE NOT COOKED FAT. So, I wasn't going to eat either which way. Now, I have to wait 24-48 hours to get my debit card refunded; my wife died a few years ago so money is tight; that's all I had to eat. So, not only did I get raw bacon, I also saw why NO ONE should eat here; they simply aren't clean. Nevermind the customer order he mixed up, then he just tears the cheese off and gives it to the people. FUCKING NASTY."}
{"text":"They serve their hot dogs on a King's Hawaiian sweet roll, and it's a total game changer. It's a perfect combination of sweet and savory so you can't go wrong with any of their hotdogs. 

I recently tried the Bad MothaClucka, and it was a huge, badass mothaclucka! The chicken was so crispy on the oustide, and so thick and juicy on the inside. It reminded me of the old Burger King chicken sandwich but like 10x better. Their sides- fries, chili cheese fries, tater tots, and onion rings, are all really good as well. 

I also love how they have seasonal specials. I tried the Loco Moco a couple of months ago for Hawaiian Food week, and it was freakin loco! It had a soy sauce and sriracha glazed meat patty, polish sausage, and a sunny side up egg, topped with gravy, fried onions, scallions, and togarashi. It was an explosion of flavors but also a bit overwhelming. 

Overall, just a great place to watch a game, socialize, have a beer, and grab a wiener."}
{"text":"This little place is so yummy!! The sliders are great, the corn dogs are tasty, the bacon wrapped hotdogs are off the chain, however if you go you NEED to get the chili cheese tots! They are the best! This place has great happy hour specials so hit it up Monday- Friday 3-6 and I think all day Sunday! I would show you a pic of my food, but I ate it all before I thought about it! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Got the Downtown Dog and Another Night in Bangkok. Best dogs ever. The love boat was great."}
{"text":"The sliders and cheese fries are the best hangover food. The staff is super nice. I was so happy they opened a place in Vegas I wanted to move to Burbank, CA because that was my first experience with Dog Haus."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure where to eat. Looked kinda suburblandia/striplandia. Decor looked completely contrived a la Chipotle. But you know me. With the carniverous gusto of a, well carnivore, I unflinchingly ordered a vegetarian bratwurst...with cheese fries, ha!  Food looked ok. But the flavour was there, all there. Great buns (stay with me, this is a family show), good vegetables, good fake sausage stuff. Really loved the cheese fries. I was almost in tears."}
{"text":"Overall a very solid artisan brat with flavorful Hawaiian buns and nice topping selections.  I had the polish sausage, but they had many options of hot dogs, hamburgers, and sausages, and even a vegetarian option if that's your fancy.  The venue is nice for an after work outing as they have 3-6pm HH and a bunch of tvs and draft list of about 8 - pretty small total but it looked mostly local so I can get behind that.  The bun was the best part of my meal. My sausage came with added onions, peppers, jalapenos, and greens.  I thought the sides were just eh and didn't add much flavor.  In hindsight maybe I should have ordered one of their named plates rather than build your own to experience the sides in a better fashion.  Still, I enjoyed my meal and was full for the same price as any other fast casual lunch in town.  Took about 20 minutes from order to mouth and friendly staff all around.  If looking for a change of pace for lunch, Dog Haus is a good choice."}
{"text":"Love it!!!! Good drinks and \"good buns\" :) Def will be back. 
I have to say that the service is great, but Elizabeth ( server) is the best."}
{"text":"First time here and every time I return to Vegas this may be a stop that will be required. I got the bratwurst with grilled onions, and the bun OH DAMN!"}
{"text":"Omg, amazing every person here loved it. Did forget a kiss meal but it was fixed easily."}
{"text":"Great place !! Very unique style hot dogs and hamburgers ! I loved it! Definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"Absolutely genius that they serve their hot dogs on toasted Hawaiian rolls. Only reason for a three star is their a little bit pricey two hot dogs two fries a corn dog and two drinks will put you behind about 38.00"}
{"text":"Really great flavor! I got the Holy Aioli burger. Delicious and like nothing ive ever had before!"}
{"text":"Was here with my mom to grab a quick bite. I could say this was indeed a great location. Food here was delectable and at a good price. My mom is not a fan of hotdogs but she did enjoy the ones they served here. As for me, I'm a sucker for great tasty hotdogs and burgers!"}
{"text":"Came here on a friend's recommendation , I must say they have a pretty good selection, the price seems a bit steep but the quality of the meal almost met the price paid. I had Das Brat with tater tots and it was a very well done and simple sausage. Not over topped. It was served on a Kings Hawaiian roll which was a unique and delicious twist. I can't wait to come back to try out the other options available on the menu."}
{"text":"Freaking delicious!! Amazing hot dogs and burgers made with high quality ingredients. My fiancée and I shared the bailoni dog and the little mule burger and savored then to the very last bite. 

Also notable, on Sunday's they have happy hour 11am - 4am! I would skip the soft serve (it's too soft) next time but will definitely try the adult milkshake in the future. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Got stuck in Vegas due to flight delay and booked a room at Hyatt Place (highly recommend). Walked across the street to a strip mall with lots of food choices and selected this place. Glad I did! I'm not a fan of hot dogs, but this one was a monster. Actually selected a polish sausage with kraut and chill to be precise. Fun change of pace. Small but very good selection of draft beers. They also have burgers if a dog or sausage is not your preference. Very friendly service Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Never made it into the restaurant itself but ordered online and got great service and great follow through.  I was contacted immediately about my order as certain things have changed and it came out perfectly.  Everything was delicious and delivery was super quick !  I'm going to save this location for future trips to vegas when I order from the hotels I stay at.  Get the Freiburger in a double.  You can thank me later!  Super Delicious, soft bread and great flavor !  Best of all?  it was enough to fill ME up."}
{"text":"Since I absolutely LOVE the Dog Haus near my home in Southern California, I had to take my girl to the newly-opened location in Vegas during our vacation.  I have mentioned Dog Haus to my Vegas friends and family and no one has heard of the place - yet. The Vegas location is fairly new, so I'm sure the word will spread quickly.

Dog Haus creates some of the best Bratwursts i have had the pleasure of putting in my face. You can order off the menu or create your own so the possibilities are nearly endless.

I had my usual - \"Another Night in Bangkok\" with the Nurenberg brat instead of the spicy brat. It comes with Thai peanut sauce, a refreshing slaw and crushed peanuts all served up on a toasted Hawaiian sweet bread bun. AMAZING! I washed it all down with lemonade.

I've been to a Dog Haus location about eight times (including the LA location) and I have not even tried their hamburgers yet. The reason is that their bratwurst are the best I've ever eaten.

I hope the Las Vegas Dog Haus becomes as big a hit as it is in LA. Pretty sure it will."}
{"text":"This is a place my hubby had bookmarked. I honestly didn't expect to like it here as much because I don't usually like hot dogs and burgers, but I ended up pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed my experience and it was a worthy of being bookmarked to check out. One thing they do here is serve the dogs and burgers on King's Hawaiian Rolls, so I was interested to see how that would turn out since I love making sandwiches on King's Hawaiian breads and rolls at home. The hot dogs are 100% all-beef skinless, burgers 100% natural Black Angus beef burgers and the sausages are handcrafted. On the menu you will find signature options or you can create your own with several options for toppings. Upon walking in we were given menus to look over and the girl who helped us answered any questions we had. The employees were courteous and knowledgeable of the menu which was nice since I was new to it. You can eat inside, outside or place your order to-go. 

The Fonz ($7.99) - Spicy Italian sausage, pastrami and melted mozzarella served on 3 split King's Hawaiian Rolls. This one is tasty. Great flavors and I'd definitely order it again. Hubby really liked it as well and even thought about going back to order another one. 

Sliders ($2.49 each) - With the sliders it's not just burgers. You can choose from a mini burger, mini hot dog or mini corndog. I chose the burger that was made with angus beef, caramelized onions, white American cheese,mayo and served in a one King's Hawaiian Roll. I hardly ever eat burgers and wished I had ordered a more of these delicious gems! Since they are mostly a 2-biter slider, I'd recommend coming during Happy Hour when they are half off. 

Chili Cheese Fries ($5.99) - These fries were smothered in house-made cheese sauce, shredded cheese, chili and green onions. The fries I had were lightly crispy and hot however they didn't \"wow\" me. The cheese sauce really had a strong flavor that I personally didn't like at all and found it overpowered the taste of the chili. The chili had no beans and was thick with good flavor. Next time I'll ask for them to substitute the cheese sauce with shredded cheese.

Onion Rings ($3.99) - The rings are beer-battered and I liked them a lot. I prefer battered rings over the panko, breadcrumbs, etc. types and they did them just right here. Freshly made, tasty, crispy and something I'd more than likely choose as a side over the fries in the future. Don't forget to ask for some buttermilk ranch to dip or choose from one of their Haus Sauces for an extra $0.79 cents each. 

They have regular shakes for $4.99 and they also have \"spiked\" shakes for $8.99 and soft serve ice cream. There is a bar inside and I recommend checking what the current HH specials are if you are coming down to drink and eat so you can save on both during that designated time."}
{"text":"Really good service and food! The chicken sandwich and the hangover burger are GREAT! The chicken was good quality, and the burger had a great flavor. They did a great job making sure we had extra sauces and everything!"}
{"text":"Had the hangover burger thru Uber Eats. It was bomb dignity. The Hawaiian bread is a nice touch and the chili is really flavorful. However, their cookie was dry on not the most enjoyable. 'Merica ."}
{"text":"We go to Dog Haus in LA and love it. This one is just as delish! The Sooo Veggie (I add jalapeños) is possibly the best plant based sandwich I've ever had! My meat eater friends say equally good things about the rest of their. Menu! Worth the trip from the strip!"}
{"text":"Corn dogs are crisp and cooked through. The batter is thin, but definitely tasty enough to make it a great corn dog. Try the Thai Fighter...it's spicy but the flavors are amazing."}
{"text":"Second time here and it's still awesome! Tried a burger this time instead of a hot dog and OMG--so delicious! I had the Little Mule and it was messy but so worth it! I definitely need to get down here more often. The quality is excellent, atmosphere is fun and u can watch your food being cooked so you know it's clean and fresh."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the Hawaiian rolls are a win! And their cheese on the fries or tater tots is to die for. Boyfriend and I really enjoyed that they were showing the game. Plus the service was A+ they were super patient with us and explained various menu items. Overall a great place."}
{"text":"The only reason why this place is getting 4 stars and not 5 is b/c I felt it took a bit long for my hot dog + burger to be served. BESIDES THAT, the food was Amazing!! (So maybe that's why it had to take a minute for my friend and I to get our food.) 

How brilliant was it put freshly made, very tasty meat- hot dog or  burger on Hawaiian bread?! You have a few different meat choices + can create your own hotdog or burger if you don't want to try their recipes. It was soo tasty! They also serve alcohol. 

This is right by UNLV so if you're in that area I'd check it out! I'll deff be back :)"}
{"text":"The recommendation came from our Lyft driver. My wife wanted Wahlburgers on the strip but our driver said why pay for a bad overpriced burger. I'm so glad we listened. I had the Cowboy with onion rings and barbecue sauce. My wife had a regular burger with tater tots. They use King Hawiian buns that are toasted and sweet which makes the burgers that much better. We went on a Sunday which had a happy hour in which drafts were 2 bucks off and other drinks were 50 percent.  The craft beers were good and they had hard liquor as well. We went back the day after and it was still one of the best burgers I've had. Will definitely be going back when we return to Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing! So freaken good. I got the brat corn dog and it was so tasty. My coworker got The Fonz and he said it was absolutely delicious. Tots and onion rings were both really good. Highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"First time coming here and will be sure to come again. The food was terrific - burger and bacon wrapped dog."}
{"text":"Great hot dog and ok onion rings. Both had a lot going on but it's all worth it. Putting the dog on the Hawaiian rolls is an excellent idea. I smothered my onion rings in cheese bacon and onions. Next time I'll say lite on the cheese."}
{"text":"omgoshhh!!! our first time here and definitely not our last!! the hot dogs and corn dogs are all beef and cooked to perfection!! we had a cpl of the angus beef sliders and they were delicious as well!! super tiny for $2.49, but well worth it!! the #1 star of this joint?? has got to be the chili cheese fries!!! they are so tasty and cheesy and oh-my-goshhhh i want some more!! lol... the staff is super helpful, friendly and attentive - go check em out!!"}
{"text":"230 reviews for a hot dog restaurant? you betcha! so many choices!  haus beer, haus wine, fun menu items like the pig lebowski, reservoir hog and the fonz.  super nice staff! and yes this is good for kids too!"}
{"text":"We ordered a delivery of two burgers, fries and soda. We were given a delivery time of 45 minutes to an hour. After the hour had passed we were given an updated delivery time of 1 1/2 - 2 hours. After waiting over 1 1/2 hours our entire order was ice cold. Literally disgusting. It seemed like they made it when we ordered but forgot to deliver it. I definitely would not recommend."}
{"text":"This place was very cool! My service was amazing! Adam and Andrew were very accommodating and personable. They had a 2 for 1 Happy Hour from 3pm-6pm that was excellent. The prices are a little up there, but the Happy Hour prices are key! Give them a try. Food was good! Great choices!"}
{"text":"Yes.

Gourmet BBQ & slaw hotdog on a bun made of three grilled and split king's Hawaiian rolls and a PBR for a few bucks.

Friendly staff, great food. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Order the chili cheese fries, shit was bomb! Came in a good portion size. Fries where covered in plenty of cheese and chili. Even added a bit of scallions to give it that extra look. They even serve beer here!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I had a hot dog called old town with jalapeños, onions, cheese, garlic aoli. It was so good.
And my bartenders Ron and Luis were great as well, super friendly and cleaning their bar the entire time I was there."}
{"text":"They have the wurst dogs in Vegas! Jk they are super delicious and affordable. As poor college students a 20$ meal for two is perfect! We ordered the Scott baioli and my partner in crime ordered the  so Cali with a red Thai curry dog. He said it was pretty spicy for those who like spice! We also tried a coconut porter which was SO GOOD. They have a happy hour for cheaper beers! If you are in the UNLV area def give this a try!"}
{"text":"We came here on Friday night of EDC weekend and was actually very surprised if not a little worried that there were only 2 other customers when we walked in but I guess we had come after the dinner rush and long before they made their way back.

Anyways,  wife got a burger and I got a veg dog with avocado and mayo which surprisingly tasted exactly like any actual beef hot dog you will find.  They have tons of other options and you can always customize it to your likings.  They use the Hawaiian sweet bun type for everything on a roll but amazing taste and a little expensive sure.  But for it,  the quality comes through.  Nice little central part of Vegas off the Strip across from HRH."}
{"text":"Great dogs and burgers, I had the old town dog which was great and a burger with the egg that's make with brisket patty
Also service was fast and friendly
I would recommend to go and try it."}
{"text":"Loving the sweetness from the king rolls mixed with the salty burger patty or hot dog. I got the little mule which added a nice spice from the jalapeños and Chipotle aioli.... the tater tots are amazing super crispy"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, food was a bit cold.  VERY messy to eat, but tasty."}
{"text":"Updating my last review.  This is my new go to spot.  Bartender is awesome...great place to get food, watch the game, and have drinks.  I get the burger and it's amazing.  
P.S. I think it's hilarious the girl who posted a bad review because it wasn't vegan/gluten free.  It's a hot dog/sausage/burger place!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was just okay.  My kids *loved* this place.  I think it may be because they saw it on YouTube, but for me, it's a hot dog - how good could it be?"}
{"text":"Pretty bummed this place did not live up to its hype. Overpriced, unsatisfying, this is not the deal.
Nice and friendly cashier and staff, atmosphere fits the name and food fare, but quality and price don't provide this place justice. I ordered the Scott baioli, a build your own dog with ketchup n tomatoes, a hangover burger and extra crispy fries...all for $25+
The fries were ok, nothing special. The Scott baioli was too much of something that was off putting..I ended up scraping all the extra condiments out and just eating the dog with the bread by itself. The hangover had chili, not bad, but didn't really need it..they use Hawaiian rolls for everything, dog buns, burger buns, etc. I like Hawaiian rolls, but it doesn't always fit with everything...this is one of those cases.
If you must try this place, just go with a build your own..it's $2 cheaper. Get the tots over the fries..no need to mess with the burgers. Probably can venture into sausages though. Unfortunately, this will not be a return place for me. Glad to cross it off the list."}
{"text":"This is an updated Review. Since my last review the owner has responded and stated that their prices are not as low as fast-food. Which is interesting because every part of the ordering process is fast food. You walk up to the counter order your meal they ask you for here or to go and they give you a number. They do bring you your food or call out for to go orders. Also like fast food you go to a soda machine. Everything is served in disposable paper products on an aluminum tray. 

The decor is industrial. All the seating is bolted to the ground. Stools and benches are your seating options. Nothing with you sit back and relax in. The counter people were nice.

 I spent $13 on a combo. I ordered the little leaguer with cheese fries and a soda. The beef hot dog was greasy I should have requested turkey dog. The chili was bland and you really couldn't fast the difference in a regular bun vs kings Hawaiian rolls. The cheese fries were good I'd get them again. Basically out of the combo that is all I would get. So the review went from a 1 star to a 2 star that's just because of the fries."}
{"text":"Been looking forward to trying the place and finally but was terribly disappointed. Way over priced ! Over 23$ for 2 combo meals-- hot dogs! Really ..."}
{"text":"the best hot dog/sausage I've ever had. I had the bratwurst and soo cali dog. Both.with an egg. Was unreal."}
{"text":"Not sure what's up with all these good reviews. Wondering if they ate the pretty food in the pictures in Yelp or the box of slop like I did today. Ordered an Ava Maria (burger), fries and a drink. The burger was soaked in grease and butter from bun all the way in. Starving, I pulled the burger apart and tried to just eat the meat, tasteless bland ground beef. I hate to be so harsh, I work near there and was hoping that I found my new spot. Only saving grace were the French fries but even those were just saturated with grease. So all in all I payed 13$ for a soda. Won't be back and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great food. Tried it the other day and the service was fast, food was good and not too expensive, and it's not far from UNLV so its convenient for me."}
{"text":"Super nice staff, gave suggestions from the menu! Everything looks sooooo good!!! Can't wait to come back to try more!!! Tots were amazing also!!! Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Literally the best chili I have ever had the pleasure to consume

One of my friends ordered me chili cheese fries thru uber for me. Instantly fell in love.

Ordered myself a chili cheese dog and chili cheese fries with a coke. Not too crazy cheap but not stupid expensive either. 

They use hawaiian sweet rolls for the buns!!! Its SO GOOD and the chili has no beans (instant win for me) and seems like it was blended or something i dont know but it sure as hell is smoooooth.

Definitly will be ordering again and again and again."}
{"text":"Just ate here tonight, 4/15/16 for the first time with my boyfriend. 

The guy taking our order was super nice as was all the staff we interacted with. My boyfriend ordered the Little Leaguer and I ordered the build your own veggie dog. I asked if it was vegan but there was uncertainty among the staff. I also ordered it in a lettuce wrap (gluten free). We both ordered the full meal with tator tots and a fountain soda.

My order came out wrong, it was the Sooo Veggie dog and not the build your own. I ate it anyway; they seemed to have new staff training so there was a lot of confusion. I thought it was good. The veggie dog itself is a good meat substitute if you like that kind of thing. If I were to come back again, I would definitely try the Veggie Smoked Apple sausage as that looks really good. My boyfriend said he liked his meal but has had better at other places. The shining star for him was the bun. Tator tots were yummy to both of us. His assessment: he's glad that we tried this place once but it wasn't worth the trouble getting to. I feel the same. The good part is they have decent prices for craft hotdogs and the staff is really nice."}
{"text":"I know some people don't like writing reviews on places they've only visited once, but I do! I loved Dog Haus. I loved everything about it except it was pretty not clean while I was there and it wasn't busy so that's the minus once star. Trash super full, tables not wiped down, etc. I feel like a jerk for snitching. Anyways.. 

Dog Haus serves hot dogs and sausages on Hawaiian sun buns. They have house ground sausages and they serve beer on tap. Totally cool place right off the strip and by UNLV. 

I thought the food was great. The Hawaiian sun buns are totally a thing. Everything was just executed well. There's another hot dog establishment down the street that is more casual, but Dog Haus is the hot dog place on Paradise to beat. Staff was knowledgeable about upgrades and combos and the products. 

I would definitely come back and even try one of their burgers."}
{"text":"Open late: check.
Decent beer selection: check. (~10 on tap, including Goose Island, some Sierra Nevadas, cider, others)
Full bar: check. (I didn't try it, but they have some special mixed drinks like \"Rebel Juice\").
Great hot dogs: check. (from your standard chicago and chili dogs to more exotic ones like the Scott Baioli, spicy slaw, etc...all served on irresistible Hawaiian buns)
Reasonable prices: check. ($7-9 for hot dogs. $6 for a kids meal including fries and a soda)
Great location: medium. (I will definitely go before Rebel games, and don't mind driving to it once in a while, but I wish it was closer)."}
{"text":"Louise was super nice.     I thought the burger would be a little better.  It was decent.   A bit dry.    It's a fun place to come too.  Not sure if I'll be back I left thinking it was just ok.  Place is super clean"}
{"text":"So happy Johnny Rockets is gone -- it even gave dirty restaurants a bad name because it was far worse.  The new look inside is industrial -- clean, simple - straightforward. Service is the same.

Menu of dogs and burgers, tots and fries has creative twists -- but nothing outside the realm of foodtrucks today. It's pricey -- $20 for 2 dogs and 2 shared tot (only complaint is when folks order well done tots -- that crispety crunchy and seriously browning - not whitish, mealy, cold inside...)  Did I complain? nope - my bad.  Red thai chili currydog was seriously spicy -- which was a nice surprise.  And buns? They use toasted Hawaiian rolls in varying fractions (3 x 1 long for dogs, 2 x 2 for burgers, 1 x 1 for sliders: clever...

Great addition to selection of near campus eateries...good luck! see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Interesting dogs and sausages on Hawaiian bread rolls!  If that sounds even a little bit tasty to you; check this place out!  The names are cute and the small bar can be a great place to stop with coworkers at the end of the day.  Won't accommodate large groups at the bar but there are long tables that you can sit at too."}
{"text":"Aside from a certain local business with a Korean-inspired name and a Strip location of a famous colorful LA institution, I wouldn't say that I have much experience with gourmet hot dogs. After tonight's visit, I'm starting to feel that I've been missing out.

Dog Haus is another sausage slinger imported from LA, one of at least 3 that come to mind. Had I not known about them before one of their LA locations was recently highlighted on a Travel Channel show, I would have probably gone anyway eventually. I can be a bit of a sucker for those places shown on TV though, and I ended up going sooner than I'd thought.

This Vegas outpost is in a certain very crowded Harmon/Swenson/Paradise-bordered plaza near the Strip, and I was fortunate not to go at anywhere near a peak hour. After carefully perusing the menu with my friend, we agreed to share some food so that we could enjoy a slightly more comprehensive introduction.

Old Town Dog ($6.99, same as their other \"Haus Dogs\"): everything packed a big flavor punch here. The sweet Hawaiian rolls (three of which are pulled from a package and split down the middle) and the plump bacon-wrapped dog might've been enough alone, but the sweet and soft caramelized onions, the spicy pickled jalapeños, the chipotle aioli, and the cotija cheese made it a party. It feels like a fairly \"safe\" flavor profile but isn't boring in the slightest, and I'd definitely recommend it.

Another Night In Bangkok ($7.99, same as their other \"Haus Sausages\"): also comes on Hawaiian rolls, but features a spiced Thai currywurst instead of a beef dog. I expected it to be spicier based on the concept and how they sold it on the TV show, but it was pleasantly mild. The peanut sauce sold me enough on the Thai concept, and the crunchy flavorful slaw really sealed the deal. I think it had less dimensions of flavor, but it lingered on the taste buds longer.

Fries ($2.99 a la carte, $3.49 with a combo): I was expecting them to be fluffier, but at least these thick-cut potato pieces had a crunch. There's a bit of an odd flavor from the oil, but the right amount of ketchup completely masks it and complements the fries overall. I no longer felt displeased to have to chew on the fries for one or two extra bites because the delay allows the combination of starch and vinegary sweetness to marry perfectly. Not a necessary side, but a very desirable one unless, heavens forbid, a ketchup shortage suddenly strikes.

Dog Haus seems to have found a winning tube meat formula with delicious ingredients through and through, and I'd be very happy to go back sooner rather than later as long as I don't run into parking issues in that jam-packed plaza. It's definitely the first hot dog restaurant on my local list for now."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! I love the veggie and non veggie options! The service was great and so friendly! I like that they're open super late night. Can't wait to try every dog and burger!"}
{"text":"So far everything I have had from this place has been great!! From the burgers to the hot dogs. I would definitely recommend this spot, and if you have not tried it you are truly missing out on a good thing."}
{"text":"So good and so affordable. Staff was friendly and efficient. The place was clean. The spiked salted caramel milk shake was amazing, the hot dogs were inventive and delicious. Solid hangover food."}
{"text":"Whaaaat... this is bomb! Food was on point and fries are deliciously crisp. On sweet bread burgers and melt in your mouth goodness patties makes this burgers better than their dogs, which I tried and I would say are excellent as well. Will come back  and the only thing that is holding me back is the price."}
{"text":"On my first visit - I was extremely happy with so many aspects of Dog Haus - the flavors, the quality of the food - a bar that stays open until 4am... 

There's some good,basic craft beers and an accommodating set of spirits if you're up for a drink with your gourmet dog. The buns .. Hawaiian Sweet Bread = delicious. Toasted nicely and just a really nice layer of flavor in the mix. 

I'll definitely be back! Thanks to a vey cool and helpful staff.. Oh and the house Bloody Mary's are also worth a try! Slightly sweet but savory and finished with bacon. 

Happy Eating !"}
{"text":"Same service but got several apologies for the wait and mistakes plus a couple of coupons for free dogs."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of times and both were great !! This last visit was for happy hour and it did not disappoint!! Their happy hour specials included 1/2 price sliders and regular fries or tots as well as bogo draft beers !! My partner and I loaded up on the sliders I had one of each! 
First was a mini corn dog that was not my favorite as the breading was a bit grainy , but inside was a plump and juicy frank, I hit that with a bit of mustard and it was out of this world , next was a mini bacon cheese dog , same juicy frank but this time served on a sweet toasted Hawaiian roll and a smattering of luscious cheese sauce and crisp bacon bits , yummy! Lastly was a mini burger on that same Hawaiian roll with a mini burger cooked to perfection with grilled onions and cheese !! This hands down was my favorite , I would definitively go back just for that alone !! I also enjoyed the cheesy tots , golden brown tots with that luscious cheese sauce on top , I would recommend though , if you go with the tots get them crisp if you add any toppings cuz they do have a tendency to fall apart when adding sauce or chili. from what I can tell their beer choices do change , but I had a pear cider which was great and an 805 lager , both were a great accompaniment to a stellar meal !"}
{"text":"The Doghaus has some bomb Hot Dogs and Burgers that are prepared with Kings Hawaiin Rolls...who does not like Kings Hawaiin Rolls? This one luckily happened to be right by our hotel we were staying at for EDC. I had The Frei Burger, If you like an egg on your burger do not hesitate to get that burger! I would give 5 stars but, the location isn't in the spot Doghaus's usually are. Not really poppin that side of the strip. The Doghaus at Victoria Gardens, Rancho Cucamonga has a more social feel. That does not take away from the service I got though, which was awesome! The food  was cooked perfectly! The beer was cold!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is amazing; both their dogs and burgers are served on Hawaiian bread. This place is great for a quick, tasty bite to eat. Two of us generally eat for around $20-$25."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for a good hot dog, and were up for something a bit different. This checked both of these on our list, so we headed over here. 

I like the parking lot here as it is big. Our cashier was very nice. As we were deciding, we noticed the variety of hot dogs, sausage and veggie options in the case in front of us. Very nice. We decided on The Cowboy for me, as I love BBQ sauce, and the Old Town Dog for my husband with its jalapenos. We also got a side of tater tots.

I like that they have napkins at the table, so they are within reach and you use only what you need. They offer ranch and bbq sauce if you ask. 

Everyone here was really friendly, and really seemed to enjoy their jobs. Once we got our food, they looked wonderful. The buns consist of 3 Hawaiian rolls together, but cut in half. The bbq sauce on mine was really flavorful. The sauce was nice and cold. However the hot dog itself was only warm, and barely even that. My husband's was the same way. The tater tots were nice and hot and crispy. We could not eat our entire meal, and ended up taking some home. 

We love the interior here, the parking lot is spacious, they have Wi-Fi, and the 'dawgs' really look great. The combinations are great, and you can even request your own toppings. The disappointment though was that the hot dogs themselves were not even hot. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Not bad for late night dinner! I would go there again if I am hungry and late  I liked the slider hotdog there just don't forget to add cheese on the top of it!"}
{"text":"It was good and EXPENSIVE. I just didn't receive $12 worth of WOW from a hot-dog & fries. It's a neat place and service was good. The food tastes good, but i won't go out of my way to eat here again. Probably best for late-night grub."}
{"text":"Driving down Swenson I noticed this place and decided to check it out for lunch. Great idea! The burger was fresh and juicy and they serve tater tots! I will make it point to frequent this place as often as I can!"}
{"text":"Yaaass! My favorite hot dog spot now! The dogs and sausages here meaty, juicy (that sounded dirty teehee), and flavorful. They come served on toasted split Hawaiian buns. Came here with a friend and sampled a couple of items. 

She had the old town dog (wrapped in bacon!) with fries which were yum too. I had the Das Brat, a Polish sausage with sauerkraut and spicy mustard, and battered onion rings. Just to round out the fatness of it all, we completed our combos with shakes, mine a dutch chocolate, and hers a vanilla. They were good, kinda tasted like Wendy's frosties.

We sat at the bar (they have a full bar by the way), and the staff was very helpful. The condiments and utensils were clear on the other side if the restaurant, but the lady who rang us up got us forks, ketchup, napkins, whatever we needed.

Coming back if I'm ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Their place is great! Food, atmosphere, drinks, service, and super clean! I did read a lot  of reviews on this place and most were pretty good. I did read a couple that ranted and raved over this place, but gave 3 stars??? At any rate, I would definitely recommend this place if you like hot dogs and burgers. I think they have beer as well, but I don't drink. Fries were on point! Shakes are super thick and yummy! Get down to this place!"}
{"text":"Four stars are given because the veggie dog \"meat\" was cold, not warm.  Did they forget to warm it?

The bun tastes like Hawaiian sweet bread.  I prefer a more plain bun.  

Skimpy on the kraut.  The fries and tots had been sitting for a few minutes so they weren't hot out of the fryer. 

Service was very good. The atmosphere is great.  

Good happy hour deal on sliders and fries.  Easy to walk to from The Hard Rock. 

Great selection of toppings."}
{"text":"So, so good!  I make it a point to stop here when I'm in town. I always get the little leaguer (chili/cheese)and cheese fries.  They have never done me wrong here!"}
{"text":"First time here, had it bookmarked forever. So you have the ability to build your own or pick a curated dog. The offer turkey, veggie, beef and sausages. I ordered the Thai red curry dog. It was so delicious. Curry taste wasn't over powering but you can definitely tell. I love spicy food and this was a little t hot for he bf but great for me. It was covered in jalapeños too. I don't normally like arugula but it paired so well with this dog. The boyfriend got chili cheese with a bacon wrapped hotdog and added garlic aioli. He loved it. We got a side of tots and had 805 on draft. They have beer and liquor, happy hour starts at 3. Service was impeccable, so friendly and willing to help. We enjoyed our lunch all around"}
{"text":"I really would want to give 3.5 stars but rounding up for great service (half star penalty for charging $7 for a dog and 5th stars are reserved for mind blowing experiences).  

Other than the price, the food and taste were very good.  I'll blame Costco for ruining our understanding of what a large hot dog should cost.

Onto the food review (First trip):
I ordered a Downtown Dog with Chili as my side.  You can tell immediately the dog itself is premium.  Juicy, flavorful, smoky grilled flavor.  Taste was great.  The bacon wrapping and use of Hawaiian roll definitely adds to the experience.  For me however, the star was the chili.  Hearty, meaty, spicy, and robust.  Very close to how I would make chili at home.  Next time I'm going to try the chili burger and chili covered tots."}
{"text":"Hangover= hangover burger. Tasted like a regular chili cheese burger. Had a bite of the big lebowski or whatever that polish dog is and it was good. The chances of me coming here again are slim. Cashier was really cool. Their happy hour is really great though. Star for that"}
{"text":"So so good.  We stopped by at midnight and the attention of the food was spectacular.  Really glad to have found this spot. We will be back"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from here off of grub hub, the place is alright we each got build your own hot dogs for 8-9$ and also ordered a side of chili cheese tots and onion rings. My husband got bacon added on his and it wasn't crispy he said it tasted like it wasn't even cooked all the way. For the price of each topping I'd think they would be more on the generous side. I want to give this place another try but in person next time around."}
{"text":"dont waste your money! We went to try these gourmet hot dogs. They were terrible. The one my husband had came with some sort of sauerkraut and it was gray. Hot dogs tasted like they had been cooked and recoiled. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Just like my hamburger theory...if you need too many add ons the meat must be lousy. 
Actually the dogs are ok, the chili sauce is essentially a gut grease slide so skip it unless you like that kind of gastro torture. 
The texas toast approach is novel and works...if your dog is not over slathered with mustard etc. 
The more is better theory is so crazily applied here that when asking for just mustard (like a normal person) and relish I was assaulted with lettuce, MAYO!!, two mustards and relish on the side. 
This is one place that could really benefit from robot ordering."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool because you have so many options to choose from because you can customize everything. The dogs are really good and the Hawaiian rolls make it unique although it makes the dogs a little hard to pick up and eat. I was not a big fan of the cheese tots because the cheese sauce was pretty bland and it just made the tots soggy. For gourmet hot dogs I prefer Buldogis all the way but this is a good spot if your on the eastside and craving wiener."}
{"text":"Amazing meal! the hot dogs aren't served in the classic buns but in bread rolls and they added more flavor to every bite. It was kinda messy to eat but so yummy. Mine had melted cheese on it and i'm a slow eater, and when i was finishing up, the cheese was still melted  that's some good cheese sauce right there. This place did not disappoint. Whenever i return to vegas, this is gonna be one of the first food stops i go to"}
{"text":"It was just okay.  My dog was strewn all over the delivery box....tipped on card.....driver was still expecting a tip....it was just ok. Delivery time was accurate."}
{"text":"When I say we stopped in just to try but were blown away. I will absolutely return and try all the fancy burgers, sausages & hotdogs. Had the Loco Moco(which is a special burger I'm assuming)but it was freaking amazing. This place is a must try."}
{"text":"I came here as a recommendation from a review for papaya dogs across the street. It was pretty expensive but really good. Papaya dogs didn't look too good at all. Anyway I paid $14 for the Scott aioli dog side of tots and a vanilla shale. All great except I do wish the actual hot dog was hotter, not spicy but actually warmer. The shake was super thick id recommend it.


Update, sorry I had to drop from 4 stars to 1, I have not been feeling good since, maybe it had something to do with the actual hot dog not really being all that hot. I'm up to 3 rush trips to the bathroom."}
{"text":"Great place to get some hot dogs! They have a beer selection but it is a little small but still great selections! 

You can create your own hot dog or pick from preset selections! Most of them look super yummy. I will be coming back to try some more hot dogs. Also a tip - make get your fries love boat style! You're welcome! I also ask to get my buns toasted / grilled.

If you're not feeling alcohol, they have shakes available here as well which are pretty awesome.

Service is super friendly! I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I recently wrote a bad review on this place. After revisiting i am super happy with the service and preparation of my order. Way to make me a believer!!!!!   

I will definately be back for more..."}
{"text":"The staff is pretty laid back and very polite. I've never been there when they're busy. But I prefer that. The dogs are always good. I even purchased a bunch of mini dogs for a work function and they were packaged very nicely. The order was ready on time to the minute. Everyone loved those dogs. As did I."}
{"text":"Best hotdog I ever had. Kings Hawaiian buns ???!!!!! YOU yes YOU need to eat here. Enough said."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place until Uber eats launched and I scrolled past it. My husband and I decided why not since it was something different. We were both very pleased especially since it was delivered. I ordered a build your own dog with several toppings and sauces and my husband ordered the Babcock dog plus the love boat fries. I was super impressed that by the time the dogs got to us they were not at all soggy or soaked. The slaw was still crunchy and the fries were still crispy. We also received the food in under the time expected which was nice. The only thing that bummed me out was that I had asked for sauce on the side and didn't receive it but even then it wasn't a big deal. We will definitely be by in person."}
{"text":"First off, I'm not a big fan of hot dogs or sausages. Ha. Ha. Ha. *insert that's what she said joke here* but a friend recommended dirt dog, which is where we meant to go to, but my boyfriend took us here bc he's a confused puppy sometimes. 

But that's ok.

Parking: We found parking right when we entered the plaza. There's plenty of other businesses in the same plaza; however the parking seems plentiful. Not sure how it is during peak hours.

Service: 5/5, greeted us with a smile as we walked in & as we walked out. They give you a number after you order & serve you whenever it's ready. Also was given recommendations on the menu! 

First impression: Clean & spacious. Plenty of tables for everyone. Extensive menu, allows for tons of substitutes if you're that person lol. 

Food: Ordered the old town dog ($6.99), upgraded to a spicy Italian sausage ($0.99), and made it a combo with fries instead of tater tots ($3.49)... Which totaled out to about $12. 

The old town dog consisted a smoked bacon wrapped dog, pickled jalapeños (which is what had me sold), chipotle aioli, caramelized onions, and cotija cheese. They overload that thing with allllll the condiments. Too many onions IMO. But the fact that I got a spicy Italian sausage instead of a hot dog, made it 10x better than it would've been. I'm a spicy kind of gal.

And did I mention they use Hawaiian bread as a hot dog bun??? RIP. 

Overall, 5 stars for the experience. But I feel like major crap right now because I never really eat hot dogs/sausages. Go ahead, make all the jokes you want!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hot dogs with mayo, caramelized onion and bacon...yes please!  A side of chili cheese tater tots that are a meal all by themselves?

I am not a huge fan of hot dogs but, every now and then I get a taste for them.  This place is the ultimate hot dog lovers stop with a huge selection of dogs, burgers, sliders, sausage and desserts.

It is counter service with a couple of tables out front in case you have your puppy with you like I did.  This location has parking in the strip mall parking lot and was an easy drive off of the strip on our way to the park.  The pricing was decent and the portion sizes are big so think about sharing that side of chili cheese tater tots!"}
{"text":"This place was Amazing... It used to be A Johnny Rocket's but I honestly Believe this is by far better. Reminds me of California meets Boston and Vegas combine in one."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great prices and the food is spectacular! I got the fonz sausage (I think that was the name) and was very happy and so is my stomach. Great little place in a convenient location. For sure recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Instantly addicted. I'm not even a chili cheese fan, but my boyfriend ordered chili cheese fries and I found myself stuffing my face with them. Hangover burger is my favorite, again thanks to my boyfriend ordering it first. Cowboy dog is close second place."}
{"text":"Randomly found this cool spot right on the edge of the strip near UNLV. 

I decided to try the Old Town Dog - bacon wrapped hot dog smothered in caramelized onions, pickled jalapeños, topped with chipotle aioli and cotija cheese, and the best part - on a hawaiian roll! Never thought to try a hot dog with a hawaiian roll, but it was an interestingly good combination. 

My friend on the other hand tried the Ringer burger - smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, onion rings, and bbq sauce. I took a bite of her burger and it was good but I still preferred my hot dog more. I'm a huge fan of hot dogs in general and have been trying to find a good spot in Vegas for quite some time now. I know there are quite a few spots in the area but this one was pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"This place is GOOOOD. We had to go to the Grand Opening because, well, FREE Haus Dogs!! It seemed to be a great turnout with a consistent line of approximately 20-30 people the whole time I was there. For a first day, everything was so smooth and we had a wonderful experience. The cashiers were proficient, we received our food quickly considering how busy they were, and someone checked in with us multiple times.

King's Hawaiian Rolls! Everything is on grilled King's Hawaiian Rolls! Dogs and sausages get three in a row and burgers get a square of four rolls. Who doesn't love these rolls?! It's brilliant!

Haus Dogs are made with special all-beef skinless dogs. There are veggie dogs available upon request. $6.99/each.

Sooo Cali: Wild arugula, avocado, tomato, crispy onions, and spicy basil aïoli. The hot dog itself is delicious; great flavor and bite. The toppings worked well together and I loved the little kick of spice from the aïoli.

Old Town Dog: Smoked bacon-wrapped dog, caramelized onions, roasted jalapeño, chipotle aïoli, and cotija. This was the most flavorful and tasty dog/sausage of the bunch. However, it was rather spicy! I would need to go light on the jalapeño and/or aïoli.

Haus Sausages are made with hand-crafted sausages. Veggie Italian Sausage and Veggie Smoked Apple Sausage available upon request. $7.99/each.

The Hot Chick: Chicken fontina sausage (chicken, fontina, basil, arugula, and red chiles; smoked), avocado, tomato, crispy onion, Sriracha, and ranch. The sausage is delicious and everything, of course, was delicious. I could've done without the Sriracha though.

The Fonz: Spicy Italian sausage (pork, basil, fennel, and chiles), pastrami, and melted mozzarella. Really great Italian sausage and again, delicious combination.

Fries ($2.99): Their fries are the skin-on handcut type and decent.

Tater Tots ($2.99): Same ol' tots we all know and love. 

This is a neat spot with delicious gourmet dogs and sausages at decent prices. I'm definitely heading back since there are so many other signature dogs and sausages I want to try, including their adorable slider dogs!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!! The food was delicious and the costumer service was fantastic.  Andrew was really nice and very personable.  Although we didn't interact much with the other employees, everyone was very pleasant and extremely professional. I made a mistake when ordering my food but Andrew was more than happy to correct it even though it was my fault. We got the Scott Baioli and the Old Town and they were probably the best hot dogs we've ever had. The chili cheese fries and tots were both delicious."}
{"text":"A twist on hot dogs and burgers. Great flavor. I love how the hot dogs and burges are served on a toasted Hawaii roll. I had another night in Bangkok it was very flavorful. The Thai peanut sauce was a perfect pair with the slaw. I will definitely be back. Hopefully next time they won't over cook the fries. Very clean establishment."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? My husband heard about this place through one of the Weekly's or Sunday's that are published around here. We finally took the opportunity one day to head over and give it a try and boy were we pleased. My husband and I both ordered their Little Leaguer which consisted of their house made chili, cheddar cheese, and onions.My hot dog was the beef one and his was the vegetarian one. We honestly thought they had messed up his order because you could not even tell it was a veggie dog at all! I wish I knew what brand it was they used. Our daughter had a half hotdog and mini slider. Between the three of we shared some tater tots and french fries, oh and not to mention instead of standard buns they use those delicious sweet hawaiian rolls. I think next time I will get the little leaguer again sans cheese and add their house slaw on it to make it a good 'ol southern style hot dog. Since spending my childhood in NC I sure do enjoy a good chili and slaw dog. Can't wait to go back and try it again."}
{"text":"First time visit, I had the burger and it was delicious, especially for a hot dog place, the staff was friendly and service was prompt, the only issue was the exterior. It was littered with trash."}
{"text":"I love Dog Haus! My first experience was a Los Angeles location & I was so excited to see they came to Las Vegas. I've never had a bad thing here. Everything is delicious; hot dogs, burgers, brats, fries, milkshakes. The best part about this place is that instead of plain buns they use Hawaiian sweet rolls & it makes all the difference. 

Customer service is great. Atmosphere is chill. Everyone needs to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Looking for a gourmet hot dog? Stop in and check this place out. From clever names to a variety of options, including your basic dog, sausage option, or hamburger variations, this place has it all. Plenty of seating available, including long picnic style seating for larger groups. Has a 6 top bar if you want to try a craft beer with your dog. (That's what I did, plenty of IPAS too ;) ) I had the Pig Lebowski, Hubby tried the Reservoir Hog, and we split the Love boat tat or to style which includes Haus chili and Haus slaw. Try this place out if you're in the hood looking for an inexpensive lunch with a bar that doesn't have keno machines glaring back at you."}
{"text":"I used UberEATS to get my order which was very fast and easy, the app said 40 minutes and I got it in 20! Awesome! =). I got corn dog sliders and a regular hot dog. I absolutely loved them both! The corn dog sliders were great sized! I Highly recommended and will order again. Very good quality gourmet hot dogs.  The corn dogs were big and crispy. The regular hot dog had delicious bacon bites and a nice toasted bun. Really great priced. I can't wait to try a bratwurst next time!"}
{"text":"This amazing gourmet hot dog restaurant is 10/10!!! Evelyn was a huge help to us while we were dinning here. It was our first time and I had so many questions that were answered throughly by Evelyn. Very sweet staff and i will come back here the next time i visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best hotdogs ever!! Lots of options and a very cool atmosphere. I got the sooo veggie and it was delicious. They also have late night happy hour so half price fries (which were super fresh)! Very filling as well"}
{"text":"I've been in Vegas for about 7 months now and I've gotten tattooed at Revolt right across from Dog Haus a couple of times yet i never actually been to Dog Haus. But after getting tatted one day and being super hungry, I decided to walk over and grab something to eat and let me tell you..... THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. The workers are by far the friendliest people I've ever met in a food place. The food was cooked in a decent amount of time and it tasted great. I got a Slider Dog and the Ava Maria burger. The thing that really surprised me is the fact that the buns is actually Hawaiian King's bread. The sweetness from the bread complimented the rest of the food really well. I'm from Hawaii so using this bread made me feel like I was back home. I'm disappointed that I never tried this place out sooner. Highly recommend trying this place out if you're ever in Vegas."}
{"text":"Yummy!  I stopped in on a whim for lunch while killing some time and was pleasantly surprised. It's a bit pricey, but not terribly so as it's next to the strip.  

I ordered a build-your-own cheeseburger, tots and a drink and it came out to around $13.  Food was ready quickly.  THEY SERVE BURGERS ON SOFT HAWAIIAN ROLLS!  Strongly recommend cutting burger into quarters.  Golden brown tater tots.  Mmmmmm. 

Cool atmosphere.  Clean.  Self-serve sodas.  Over all a good experience!"}
{"text":"Great experience at this place! I really appreciate that they don't limit themselves or their customers - they have a variety of sausages available and even a veggie option. Not feeling a hot dog? They got burgers! 

We got wonderful service today from two female employees. Super friendly staff. 

Very clean establishment.

The beer selection is small, but adequate. 

Pictured are the Cocky Balboa dog and The Hangover burger. Super delicious choices. We didn't care for the fries, though. They were a little plain."}
{"text":"Yo I don't know about this late shift but man awful! I order the holy aioli and a corn dog. Well the burger came raw and I asked the guy at the register of it looked raw he was like naw it's good it's medium lol I'm like hell naw it's raw but that was the burger now about this corn dog smh it looked like it was thrown around in the grease were the batter was not on there and burnt I can't believe they would serve me that bullsh** so if I was you go during the day time and stay away from the night shift very disappointed"}
{"text":"Hang up if one of the males answers the phone, this ultra high sounding  kid screws my order up every time."}
{"text":"Back again!!! Old town dog for my man, sliders&fries for me..I will definitely try everything!!!"}
{"text":"The burgers are on point! The corn dog batter is amazing and the shakes are good! I will be back"}
{"text":"Amazing service! My burger with chili, egg and bacon was delicious. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"All-in on Old town dog. I don't know how to explain, but their Old town dog is just a killer. Make sure to order tater tots on the side. It really goes well with hot dog."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both my choice were sooooo good! I had to take my kiddos so they can enjoy the goodness too. I LOVE gourmet links, their flavors blend so well with the toppings, regardless of what you pick! my first visit, I got 'another night in Bangkok' and the spicy thaicurry brat was super flavorful and the spice kicked perfectly with the coleslaw with the peanuts and peanut sauce being the balancer. the second time, I got the so Cali with the spicy Italian, their spicy basil aioli was sooo good I got extra on the side for my fries. if you like basil as much as I do, I fed recommend trying it! my fiancé got the old town dog & didn't speak to me until he was done... goes to show how yummy that was for him AND he didn't share  the love boat is super filling, that in itself could be a meal. I put 4 stars because it is a wait for your food, but it's worth it"}
{"text":"I love coming here. The food is so delicious and the service is good. I like all the different combinations of food they put together in their hot dogs. One of my favorite items is the burger with the egg over easy in it. It's the best one they have there. I have yet to try their brat sausage links yet but that's next on my list !"}
{"text":"Checks in the cage.  Hoodies off.  Another 16 hours at the WSOP in the books.  A wave of mental exhaustion as we step into the blast furnace of the Vegas evening, someone putting it in the air (not from me).  And then...

\"I'm hungry\" someone proclaims.

\"Yeah me too.  Tacos or hot dogs\"  says another.

\"M E A T in a T U B E!\"  announces Midwest poker bud.

\"Oh brother.  Dog Haus it is\".  And that's all she wrote.

Small but rapidly expanding chain serving loaded dogs and flavorful sausages.  This isn't Biker Jim's.  No need to worry about alligator or rattlers in your sausage.  Just flavorful beef, chicken, and pork.  Good dogs and sausages with no claims of heritage pork, hormone free, antibiotic free, all natural, etc.

Choose a dog or sausage from the display case or one of the premade menu items and you're good to go.  Sub any dog or sausage ($1 extra) in any premade sandwich.  All sandwiches are made on grilled Hawaiian sweet bread rolls (three rolls for a sausage).  The sweetness makes the proteins sing.

Toppings make the dogs.  Leading the list is \"Another Night in Bangkok\".  Take the spicy Thai currywurst with its porky goodness and warming curry heat and top it with a creamy satay sauce, crushed peanuts and a pile of slaw.  Flavor town.  A close second, the \"Old Town Dog\"  Smoked bacon around a dog topped with caramelized onions, jalapeños, cheese and topped with a spicy chipotle aioli.  Salty, zesty, and satisfying at 2am.

Great chili cheese tater tots as a side.  So unhealthy but oh so good.

The only major misstep, the root beer batter corn dogs.  Soft with a strange, off putting burnt sugar bitterness.

Speedy no frills service.  Beer a plus.  HH, M-F 3pm-6pm and reverse HH, everyday 1am - 4am with two for one beer and wine.  Open late (4am).

A hyped up rating perhaps but worthy to satisfy that late night craving."}
{"text":"Be prepared to make room in your stomach!!
California-based Dog Haus has landed in Las Vegas!!! 
A stacked menu full of appetizing gourmet hot dogs, sausages, burgers and beer. Oh! My! 

Dog Haus is a home run, there's nothing on the menu that doesn't scream \"OMG!\" or \"That Looks So Good!\" They serve the dogs and burgers on Hawaiian Rolls, which makes it hearty.

Sooo Cali
Arugula, Spicy Aioli, Onions, Avocado and Tomato
This hot dog blew me away and I can understand why.
The frank was juicy, not mushy and was firm when I bit into it. Zestfulness from the toppings and crunch from the onions. The bread was soft and held the dog nicely like in a pillow.  
Simply unbelievable you have to try it!!

The Freiburger
White american cheese, Fried Egg, Slaw, Fries and Mayo.
This burger is an absolute monstrosity, and I'm not talking about the size. This is one of those rare times I took a pause while I was eating and subconsciously prayed to hamburger gods, told them thank you.   
    
The service was fast and friendly. The staff was nice and helpful answering questions that I had. 

Dog Haus has great balance between a sports bar and a fast casual restaurant!!
This is a great joint I'll definitely be going back there."}
{"text":"Was my first time at this place & I already decided to go back n take some of my friends. I loved how they use Hawaiian buns as the hot dog buns. It's delicious and the flavor is definitely there. I had the Sooo Cali hot dog with Spicy Thai Frank. What a combo! Can't wait to try their onion rings next time I go. Glad this place opened up in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped by the other day for lunch with the family. This place was awesome, the hot dogs were excellent and the tater tots were cooked perfectly. I had the Old Town Dog and it was great. My wife built here own, which is a great option, and the kids loved the kids size corn dogs and sliders. Overall a great place to eat, hope they open a few more locations so I don't have to drive near the strip."}
{"text":"If david hasselhoff was a hot dog, he'd be @ dog haus... This place is awesome and crazy quick and convenient"}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME! The service was great, it was clean, and the food was excellent!! We were pleasantly surprised. We will be back often and definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a good different dog!"}
{"text":"I've only had the happy hour sliders and actually tried all 3! The burger was delicious as well as the hot dog slider. I didn't really care for the corn dog slider. Love the chili cheese fries- sooo good!"}
{"text":"They food is nasty they burgers they. Chicken sandwiches  has no flavor I will never go back"}
{"text":"They just opened so hopefully their service gets better as they work through the kinks and get faster at preparing food, we waited for a food 20-25 minutes for the food to come out. 

Their food on the other hand was great!! The freiburger was by far my favorite, it's served on a sweet roll with American cheese, mayo, fried egg, slaw and fries. Soo good. (7.99)

The fonz was good, but I personally wouldn't get it again. It was on the salty side. Italian spicy sausage with pastrami and mozzarella. (7.99)

My daughter got the corn dog kids meal it was pretty big with fries and 2 \"sliders\"

We also got the caramel \"spiked\" milkshake. Which was better than I expected! It was a good mix of alcohol and Milkshake."}
{"text":"Great concept, terrible execution. First off, avocados shouldn't be as hard as raw potatoes. Whatever prep cook thought it was fine to cut that very un-ripe should not be in the kitchen. Next, service, the guy was a space case, said he'll bring us our beers out, and didn't until I had to ask. Next the guy proceeded to argue with my friend about messing up putting tomatoes on his dog instead of the ordered pickled red peppers. I got out of there for $20 for a beer, dog, and some plain tater tots. Meh."}
{"text":"I must be missing something.   Came here based on yelp reviews alone.  Usually a place with over 200 reviews and almost 5 stars doesn't disappoint.  However, this place must use the money made from its 1 time customers to buy their reviews.  I should of known it was going to be bad when I asked how the chili was and they compared it to Wienerschnitzel 

We tried the chili dog, regular hot dog, burger sliders, corn dog, fries and onion rings.  All of it was subpar.  Tasteless for the most part.  However if your lips are chapped, they will thank you, because the amount of grease that was in everything not only left my lips plenty moisturized but made me fee like I needed to apologize to my heart and arteries for the next month. 

Maybe their gourmet dogs and beer is where it's at."}
{"text":"There dogs and burgers are so gooood  me and my bf also love the tots! Food always taste great :) our fave is the holy aioli burger !"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place but I'm extremely disappointed on their attitude handling Postmates deliveries. Per our delivery person they said the food was ice cold and the shakes were melted and refused to remake the food. I'm glad my Postmates delivery person stepped into say something because if my food arrived like how she described it I probably would still write a bad review. Shame on you guys. :/"}
{"text":"All right if you haven't been to Dog Haus and you like hotdogs well then you're missing out. They are located all over Southern California. They also have locations in Yuma Arizona,  Colorado, Las Vegas Nevada, Texas, Tennessee and Utah.
My personal favorite hotdog to order is the Sooo Cali it's made with wild arugula, crispy onions, spicy basil aioli, avocado, and tomato absolutely delicious. I also would recommend you try the corn dog which is like the high end corn dog at Disneyland in Anaheim with the thick corn bread covering and well done, not the sad soggy limp corn dog they sell throughout the rest of the park, I think Disney sells both just to confuse people. Anyway back to Dog Haus they also have Hamburgers, Milkshakes, Chocolate Chip Cookies and  Coctails for those of you that want to add a little something to your Dog Haus experience.
A huge bonus is that they are open until 4:00AM here in Las Vegas  they are literally right across the street from the Hard Rock hotel casino on Paradise Rd.
Personally I think they should get really creative and add a few more hotdogs to the menu to really set it off I guess we'll have to wait and see. Anyway get in there try them out"}
{"text":"Favorite hot dog in Las Vegas. Love the Sooo Cali and Scott Baioli. Good menu with selections other than dogs."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I'm not going to get into how long and juicy the weiners are like all the other reviews..rofl.. but I will say this place is Great.. I tried the Fonz.. and it was awesome. . Everything was fresh and delicious. . The pastrami seemed to be very high end and the bun,dog,and cheese were unbelievable. . Fortunately I work right around the corner so I will defiantly be back.."}
{"text":"Great place! I got the veggie dog with cheese sauce and onions. It comes on a sweet Hawaiian bun and it is delicious. The bartender was nice and the atmosphere is chill. The cheese tots were good as well. Definitely a must go."}
{"text":"All right quick, simple, unique and what I'd call comfort fast food. Definitely indulgent and decadent greasy spoon style grubbing. The dogs are creatively thought out combos with an artful presentation. I had the veggie dog tonight. It is piled high with arugula, avocado, and some sort of crispy onion things plus a spicy aioli sauce to juice it up. Now for the bun and hold onto your hats here.....it's three toasted Kings Hawaiian sweet rolls still connected straight out of the package. If you've had Kings sweet rolls I need not explain the sweet collaboration of tastes this is invoking. Very interesting twist! Kudos to the combo designer. I accompanied my dog with your standard yet satisfying good old fashioned French fries. They offer a variety of craft beers(always a plus) to quench your thirst or grab an all you can drink fountain soda. 
 The dining room is what I would describe as an industrial, loft type feeling motif. It was clean and spacious. Out front is a couple tables also.  
 Service was prompt and kind."}
{"text":"Great food,great customer service my Husband and I will definitely be back.I had The Ringer combo and my Husband had a bacon wrapped hotdog with cheese and Aurelio sauce combo with tater tots w/chili. Far from home but worth the drive. Please consider putting a location in Centennial Hills area."}
{"text":"Second trip back to Vegas and my boyfriend insisted we had to come back here because the Instagram pics looked so good. We decided to order several more items on the menu to try because everything sounded so good. He ordered the hot dog special of the month (I can't recall the name), I ordered the Free Bird, then we split a burger slider, the chicken sandwich, the tots with chili and a mini corn dog. The corn dog was just ok, I couldn't taste any of the root beer in the batter. We both liked the chili for the tots more than expected. We were both fans of the burger slider. My boyfriend is a chicken sandwich snob and wasn't a huge fan, but I absolutely loved it and couldn't get enough - and I'm normally not a fan of fried food on a sandwich in general. The sandwich was so flavorful and moist - I finished it all even though I was stuffed. My hot dog was even better than last time - the miso ranch combined with the avocado was just to die for. What can I say, this is the best hot dog place ever and we'll be back every time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Been here twice so far. Tasty goodness and great friendly service. Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"As I have stated before in another review with a different restaurant I am not a huge fan of the dog! But my man is...sooooo I am always looking for places that serve up dogs for him. Came across Dog Haus on Instagram and thought it looked very interesting...and reviews sounded great so I thought we should give it a try.
1st off it is in a really great strip mall with lots of things around..I have probably driven past this mall 100 times and never realized anything in it. They had GREAT music playing as we walked in and very friendly staff..plus plus! Great start! We then grabbed a menu and sat down. Great names for each menu item.  I am boring so I got the all beef hot dog with cheese sauce and mustard and the cheese fries!! The dogs are served on Hawaiian bread rolls...amazing idea. The dog was cooked perfectly and the cheese sauce...mmmm mmmm good. Perfect ratio of cheese to dog and mustard. 
The man must have been in the mood for chili since all 3 items he ordered were covered with it. He had chili cheese tots...the chili idol dog and the reservoir hog which was a Polish sausage with chili, slaw and mustard. He was not sure how he would feel about slaw and chili together...welll.....it was down in the belly in about 5 mins...I'd say he enjoyed it!
Chili is hard...it's either really good, ok or terrible. Luckily for him it was really good!!! I kept sneaking bites of his tots!
We will definitely be back to try more concoctions!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is good when you're feeling really hungry. You're going to leave feeling stuffed. The menu is big and it's clear, the way it should be. The employees are helpful and get you your food fast. The music in these locations is really good. I enjoy the environment for munching. Best part is that the food is great here at Dog Haus. I recommend this place to you all. The location is nice with plenty of parking. Its spacious so bring the groups here to have a good meal that's enjoyed."}
{"text":"One of the best hot dog places around. Got the old town dog and the hot dog itself was so flavorful and bacon wrapped!!!! All the toppings it came with went so well together and the buns which were the sweet hawaiian rolls was delicious. Definitely gonna try more of the menu. The service was great too and the staff member that helped me was really friendly and took the time to explain the menu and give recommendations."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I had the best burger I have ever had. Everything is natural and fresh. Service was great and they have good happy hour specials. I recommend this place to anyone they even have vegetarian options."}
{"text":"My husband and I always go here after concerts on our way home. They get busy sometimes, so we'll call in orders on some nights. I usually go for their slider menu. I really like their corn dogs. They have an awesome happy hour special, too."}
{"text":"You have got to check this place out!! And if you go come get me first! 
  So first let me just say the workers are so nice like a genuine nice. 
   We ordered the holy aioli added a side of chili cheese fries and then got a 2 slider kids meal for my daughter (she's 21 and couldn't believe it was a kids meal cause it was so filling). We had the burger cut in half and split the chili cheese fries and my husband and I were stuffed! It was delicious !
  The place is super clean and a fun atmosphere.
They have coke products but that burger was killer so I won't hold that against them.  If you're a local let them know, since locals get a discount"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of tater tots but wanted something to go with my burger & decided to go crazy so I had the chili cheese tater tots & I  love them. I order from here everyday I'm in Vegas. I just can't get enough. And the sweet buns just make the burger 10x better."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good. It's a little bit pricey. I got the Another Night in Bangkok or something like that. Really good if you like spicy. Everyone loves tater tots too."}
{"text":"This was absolutely ridiculous.  We waited over 20 minutes for a to go order.  The girl brought the food and said the order.  We left and when we arrived at our destination, there was only one hot dog.  I bit in into the fries and they were partially frozen and greasy.  

I called the store, and the cashier admitted to forgetting the other part of the order.  When speaking to the manager, Elizabeth Hernandez, the first thing she said was, \"You forget your order?\"  Clearly, the staff lied to her or she did not want to admit it.  I told her about the frozen fries and she did nothing about it.  She said, \"I give you one meal.\"

After giving uas the run arohnd she refused to make it right.
I was one of the first 20 people in this location, in only 1 month this place has way down hill.

After taking a bite of the hot dog, the end has freezer burn.  Avoid this place at all costs.  

Another note, the taps weren't working for beer!"}
{"text":"There is nothing i love more than cheap beer and food under $10. So good! I had the hangover burger and love boat fries! So good! definitely recommend"}
{"text":"We followed advice from a reviewer and drove to this place after eating at Papaya King, the hot dog itself is good, did not care for the king's Hawaiian bun or the chili, which wasn't that special, price is more than double that of the other place. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Good dogs and sausages. A little bit on the salty side to my taste but its good food overall, small bite it seems but it does fill you up if you order fries and drink to make it a combo. The price is good. I love the interior of the restaurant. They also have full bar and do the delivery."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB!!!! First time eating at the one in Cali and I'm so excited we have one in Vegas. Customer service is off the hook, they care about their food.
Freshness is something they pride themselves in and you can taste it in the food. 
Quality will get you forever customers.
I work at revolt tattoos across the parking lots so it looks like this is gonna be our new eatery. 
Thanks to everyone for a fantastic experience. 
Everything is great, u can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I love this place! Me and my boyfriend didnt know what to eat one day so we just started browsing yelp and found this. Food is great, staffs are friendly and not too crowded. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with these delicious hotdogs!!!! They have one for every palate, sauces, cheeses, sausages, chicken. I get the turkey ones and I love them! That Hawaiian bread is a killer combination! If I come back to a place more than once it's a hot spot for me :-)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a lovely Vegas Saturday. This occupies what used to be a Jonnhy Rockets, but the vibe is much much cooler here. Great soundtrack, friendly and quick staff, and delicious food. I had the Ava Maria, a burger with mushrooms, cheddar cheese, and caramelized onions; my hero had The Fonz, spicy Italian sausage with pastrami and mozzarella. With drinks and sides, our total was right about $25. Everything is cooked to order, but the wait was not long at all. Hubs was impressed enough to try a milkshake after our meal!
All in all, we dug it and will likely return. I think it's worth fighting the traffic on Paradise!"}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal. The hot dogs have incredible flavors and the King's Hawaiian roll buns are toasted to sweet perfection. The tater tots are crunchy and light (as opposed to most greasy tots.) Why only four stars? Price. Dog Hous is  ever-so-slightly overpriced. Maybe that's a good thing. If these delicious dogs were cheaper, I'd become a regular which would shrink my bank account balance while simultaneously increasing my waistline."}
{"text":"First visit, tried the Soooo Cal dog, which was tasty, but you need a mouth the size of a basking shark to get it down, it is so piled high with fried onions. Thumbs up for the dog, the gourmet bun and the fries. Lots of interesting choices on the menu and looking forward to trying some more."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a group of friends that were attending a volleyball tournament at UNLV.  The place was pretty quiet during the lunch hour, so we had the place to ourselves.  
Everyone was pleased with their dogs, burgers, onion rings and tater tots. Plenty of food, could have easily shared my meal."}
{"text":"Me and my hubby ordered thru UberEats. I had the little mule and my husband had the cheese burger!! It was BOMB! Not a fan of burgerbuns so I really enjoyed the dinnerrolls bun! Messy but all worth it! Husband says for sure this will be our favorite late night snack! Might try to visit the store when we get a chance. And will definetly try the hotdogs! 5stars for our burger tonight!!"}
{"text":"This is long overdue review, as I've been to this spot a few times.  This is about my first experience at Dog Haus.  

We didn't feel like going to the strip or to a bar like we normally would to get something to eat at a late hour.  Now, we are actually not fans of hot dogs in general.  I looked up their menu online and saw burgers so we thought, \"Why not?\"  Upon arrival, we were feeling a little adventurous and ordered hot dogs anyway.  I had the Pig Lebowski and he ordered the Scott Baioli.  After his first bite, my husband said \"This is serious!\"  I felt the same way about my dog.  So good!  My dog came with the house slaw on it and I ordered more slaw on the side.  It was fresh and crisp and not soggy with too much mayo like other places might prepare it. We'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Decided to try this establishment during our work lunch hour. That was our first mistake. We arrived around 1:45pm and there was only ONE customer in front of us. We proceeded to order 2 different kinds of sausage dogs. The Fonz and Cocky Balboa. The meal was good, but the service was below standards. There was 6 groups of customers AFTER us that ordered, but somehow received All their food Before ours. I proceeded to the cashier and advised her that we still did Not our food and Everyone after us was already eating. They stated it was because our sausage meals take 7mins to cook. I believe they forgot our order because at this point it was past 20mins. There is no way the 1 cook can make 6 groups of orders and our order still not be done. The food is good, but it was an extremely disappointing experience. Being so close to the Las Vegas Strip you would assume they would have better service standards."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and made some great suggestions. They have a variety of hotdogs, sausages, and burgers all served on Hawaiian rolls-which is so creative. I have the sooo veggie sausage. Vegetarian applewood smoked sausage, with avocado, tomato, arugula, tomato, and fried onion. The flavors went well together and it's very filling."}
{"text":"Went to go to Gray's Papaya BUT it closed went across the street to the Dog Haus. I had a Downtown Dog . It was fantastic. Great variety of condiments with a tasty hot dog. Really reasonably priced. Friendly staff. Close to UNLV"}
{"text":"Andrew W. was a kind and fantastic person who served us today. If he's helping you out, know you're in good hands."}
{"text":"Its always the same perfect taste to our food.....always first class... if u arr in vegas and u haven't had one. You better ask some one...."}
{"text":"Note - My rating only applies to the burger \"Bun\". It happens to be a sweet Hawaiian roll. Sh$%!!  I'm only finishing the burger+bun because i don't want to waste food.  Atmosphere=Excellent!  Service=Excellent!  Everything else except the bun, possibly excellent! Recommended by a co-worker who did NOT advise about the hawaiian sweet roll bun. Sh$%!! Not to put down the sweet rolls, they are a good eat when in the mood. Might be nice to option customers a regular bun. Damn i hate to review negatively, but please do not recommend unless you for-warn of the sweet roll. Shi$%!! Give me a plain o'l bun anytime."}
{"text":"While continuing the subject of memorable hot dogs and assorted related American picnic fare, I just savored two great varieties at Dog Haus quite a bit closer to home.  Henry Winkler, The Fonz of \"Happy Days\" fame, should be proud of \"The Fonz,\" a nice combination of spicy Italian sausage and high-quality pastrami modulated by smooth melted Mozzarella Cheese all embedded within the confines of a large and noticeably sweet grilled King's Hawaiian Roll.  The sausage contained just the right amount of spice, and the pastrami was much more meaty than fat, and not dry like some that engender a gag reflex.  This beast on a roll was accompanied by great golden Cheese Tots which had been removed from the fryer at just the right moment and then smothered in a very tasty mild Cheese Sauce.

After a suitable respite to absorb the first round of eating, a Build Your Own Dog was next on tap for me.  After giving some thought to the matter of what among myriad available elements I would like in my dog, I settled upon free add-ons of yellow mustard, onions, tomatoes, dill pickles, and two premium ingredients requiring an extra charge: Haus Chili and sauerkraut.  When I first bit into the hefty skinless all-beef wiener, I was surprised how moist and tasty it was.  The remaining bitten top even glistened with juices as I gazed down on it before moving in for the next bite.  And, I was quite pleased that partial slices of fresh tomatoes were included instead of small bits of tomato; the white sauerkraut was first rate; and the brown chili was very nice, with a silky texture and just enough heat to make it a desirable dish in its own right without overpowering the rather complex edible construction.  

Not being a purist in matters of adding ketchup to a hot dog except in the case of a classic Chicago Dog, because I generally like the taste of tomato ketchup along with yellow mustard on hot dogs and hamburgers, after one bite I opted to pour a thin trail of this red condiment along the length of my dog from the self-serve stand across the room.  After this, for me personally, enhanced by fine skin-on fries also dressed lightly in ketchup, my dog, which was encased in another grilled King's Hawaiian Roll, became near perfection on a metal tray.  Meanwhile Diane consumed her root beer-battered Corn Dog--which was bigger than most--and happily finished off the remainder of my Cheese Tots. 

Service was friendly and efficient, although someone else's order was mistakenly brought to us first; loud piped in heavy metal music was a nice change of pace from Sirius's The Blend's offerings on my car's satellite radio; and wooden bench seats were comfortable enough that I was not distracted by the hard, ungiving surface.  The food had my full attention, and there was no scrimping on providing generous portions of high-quality ingredients in inventive combinations here.

I will be back soon to try a burger, which I was told by a member of the wait staff can be made medium rare to order; and to enjoy some Haus Chili on its own!"}
{"text":"No words can describe the true happiness I get from every menu item here. Staff is always so friendly, always willing to help too. From dogs to burgers or brats, or fries to tots. This place has it all and they do it so right!"}
{"text":"Come here all the time, all of the staff is awesome and the food is great here. They have  IPA draft double daddy which is really good, highly recommend. Also there little mule burger is bombdotcom."}
{"text":"Any place that offers a veggie dog that doesn't taste like mostly water is most definitely on my radar. And while it's pretty pricey, it's a price I'm willing to pay. 

Sooo Veggie is their signature veggie dog option, and while you can substitute it in any other menu item, you should definitely give it a try. Similar to their Sooo Cali but replaced with a flavorful, sweet, smoky apple veggie sausage, it's topped with deliciously crispy shoestring onions with arugula, avocado, and tomato for freshness. It's also topped with a basil aioli that lends an herby component with a liiil' kick. It's bomb.com, and to make it better, they stuff it in a sweet, buttery Hawaiian roll. 

I would definitely stick to their hot dog in a bun options. Their hot dogs on a stick are okay, but I don't think they're much better than the ones served up at a mall fast food chain. 

As for their sides, they are massive. And while they're by no means the star of the show, they play a decent support role to round out the meal. One hot dog and one side to share is the perfect portion to leave me feeling satisfied and then some."}
{"text":"Fantastic hot dogs and sausages, incredible King's Hawaiian buns and exotic toppings - a great combination.  Add in friendly service and plenty of parking and you have a winner.  Plus they have soft service ice cream and a bar - I did not want to leave."}
{"text":"I've ordered twice from grub hub at this location and I have to say they serve THE best hot dogs in Las Vegas highly recommend this place try it out food is delicious"}
{"text":"Welcome to the dog house! Literally!

I was surprised that they have a pretty big menu considering it's a hot dog place. They have burgers, fries, and desserts too. The atmosphere is really cool, (definitely better than the Johnny Rockets that was there before). They have alcohol and happy hour with beer and food on the menu. They're open late. And in central Vegas. 

I got the slider dog and corn dog and some fries. Then slider dog had cheese and bacon (YUM). The chocolate shake was also to die for (drizzled with chocolate sauce). They have very friendly service and greet you upon entry and acknowledge you when you're leaving. I'm definitely going to come back to try the rest of their menu. It's worth coming to, trust me!

Oh, and FREE wifi!"}
{"text":"I had some preconceived notions walking in. This isn't the first place to make fancy hotdogs and it won't be the last. I picked the Sooo Cali because it sounded good to me, not too heavy. (Note, this is far from diet food and if you are on a diet don't even walk in the door.) I would have ordered a combo with a shake but their machine was down and decided on a New Belgium Citradelic instead with a side of tots to share w a friend. 

The dog was a little awkward to pick up because Dog Haus doesn't use hotdog buns which over the years have been conditioned to fit hotdogs perfectly, they use three unseparated King's Hawaiian Rolls which have been toasted on the grill with a little butter. This bun base perches the dog a little high and then you have the array of toppings sitting on top of the dog. In this case we had wild arugula, tomato, crispy onions, spicy basil aioli, and avocado. The mix of flavors and textures is worth the mess you are about to create and lean forward to not drop any escaping crispy onions from hitting your pants.  The tots were good, despite the light color they were freshly fried nice and crisp. You can find plenty of napkins on the tables. 

This isn't an every week kind of place but definitely great enough to make me want to try a sausage or burger next time. Hopefully their ice cream machine will be working for a dark chocolate shake."}
{"text":"So happy they opened one of these in vegas!! I love their sliders!!! They come with the most delicious cheese sauce and grilled onions on a Hawaiian roll. I'll take those over in-n-out any day!!!"}
{"text":"So I've made a lot of bad decisions in my life and not going to Dog Haus while I was a UNLV student and mere minutes away everyday certainly counts as one of them. I ended up at Dog Haus because one of my mates from London had a bit too much to drink the night before and wanted \"some dirty delicious American food\" this turned out to be one of the best decisions we made. Since it was first time we decided to order a few things and share. We got the little leaguer, hangover burger and the reservoir hog with regular and chili cheese tots. First off, they use quality bacon which is a must with me and their party is definitely fresh ANd well matched. I also am a giant fan of Hawaiian rolls and their sweetness totally pairs well with the savoriness of the meats and chilies. 
I like their combinations of meats and veggies and stuff and that most of their sausages are wrapped in bacon because you can never have too much bacon. 
They also serve alcohol and they had several delicious looking beers on tap but I wasn't able to park take. Neither was I able to put their margaritas to the test. I love that they advertise having alcohol instead of basically keeping it hidden like another restaurant *cough*Chipotle*cough*  hot dogs and margaritas and GOOD BACON= 5 stars from me anyday"}
{"text":"Loved it I definitely will return.  Love the Hawaiian bread buns good quality hot dogs  best best"}
{"text":"Not really sure how his place has good reviews. The sausages id give maybe a 4 or 5 out of ten, as average as you can get. Every side or topping etc on the menu is definitely dog crap shipped to the masses in a sysco truck. This was a bad meal."}
{"text":"I went in on a Thursday Evening, it was not to busy. 
I ordered a plain hot dog, fries and a drink.
It took them 20 minutes to make that order and then it sat on the counter for another 5. I just watched as it got cold so I got up and grabbed it myself. 

Other than that the food was good."}
{"text":"This was the first spot we ate at when we landed in Las Vegas! The employees were very attentive and the food was really good! 

No complaints here! I would be back next time I'm in town!"}
