{"text":"This is my new favourite restaurant. I had the shrimp and grits, which sounds like a disgusting combination -- but isn't. In fact everything that our group had was fantastic. This place is really, really good. In the end we paid about $50/person including wine and appetizers and it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Had a FANTASTIC meal last night.  Service was great and each dish was more delicious than the next.  The Rye-Sotto was a special treat.  All dishes were flavourful and unique.  Can't wait to return.  Make sure you ask them to make one of their 'special' Mojitos (not listed on the menu)"}
{"text":"Came down here on a b-day for our dear friends on a cold snowy day. We had the Groupon coupon and the owner David was very up-front about the price adjustment changes which were fine by us.  Its nice casual dine place that is not too dark and its a place you can have conversation. Started off with 'Rainbow Trout Tartare'. As first timer trying this fish tartare, it was nice and flavourful as everyone is picking off it quick. We also had the Chef Board which featured scallop ceviche and different sashimi style fish and some pickel veggie. Although there are some interesting elements in there, I did not feel the price justified what the board offered, but nevertheless, its still a good experience taste.  Main meal: My gf got the Black Cod (Sablefish)...This was a delicious meal and she had two thick pieces where most dining place would get one. Its complimented with miso noodles and mushrooms. I got the whole market fish for the first time...Black Sea Bass! The fish was very fresh and tasty, and the sides were great. Had some green rapini veggie, and tried some awesome artichoke which I thought was potatoes.   My friends got the braised short rib which is fall off the bone good, and his wife had the Arctic Char which was also quite tasty.  For Desserts, we got the chocolate fudge pudding like, and trio ice cream of caramel swirl, chocolate, and pumpkin...  The server was very nice and friendly and also quite educated in the meal info. The owner David is quite pleasant, and I enjoy the feel of small restaurant where you can get the chance to meet the chef and their inspiration.   His dishes definitely represented the sustainable fishes he serves and our enjoyment of the evening. We will gladly come back on another occasion.!"}
{"text":"Redfish lives up to the hype. We used a $39 voucher for 2 which includes 1starter, 2 mains and a dessert. We had the BC grilled sardine to start and the Rainbow Trout and Cioppino. The Cioppino was an extra $12 on top but well worth it - think Frutta di Mare without the pasta. Generous portions of Mussels, Shrimp, Scallops and calamari. Can't wait to sample the brunch menu."}
{"text":"I was at Redfish this week to celebrate my SO's birthday.  I was able to make reservations easily online through OpenTable.  Redfish is located just west on College past Ossington and to my surprise has free street parking after 6pm!  I had bought a groupon for a dinner for 2 deal - one appetizer, two mains and a dessert; the wait staff were aware and their level of service did not change because we had a groupon.  The food was incredible, everything from the oysters, trout tartare, mussels et frites, lake huron white fish and down to our dessert, the sticky toffee pudding.  It was just the right portioning for each course.  Redfish does not use frozen seafood and you can test it in the texture of the seafood you are eating.  One of the things I really like about this place it is one of the few (if not only) sustainable seafood restaurants in the city.  Service was top-notch, everything was taken care of during the evening for us.  They even brought a candle out for my SO with our dessert when I mentioned it was his birthday.  Our host mentioned they change their menu regular to make sure the seafood matches the season and availablity.  I will definitely be back for future dinners."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant whose main selling point is that they are Toronto's only 100% sustainable seafood restaurant.   So after organising a UYE here with 20 other hungry friends/yelpers not one left the place hungry after sitting through 4 hours of no stop food.  Throughout the four hours we had excellent service from both the owner, Jamie, and the chef David who both spent much time giving us plenty of details on each dish and how they go about preparing them. I kid you not David has to be one of the most passionate and knowledgeable people when it comes talking about the menu.  This was also my first time trying oysters and it was a big task for any restaurant to make me want them again but Redfish delivered and with the variety of Oysters on offer with the dressings to enhance the experience I am itching to try them again.  Out of the 12 dishes we all sampled the octopus ssam, the arctic char, spaghetti con bottarga and the steelhead trout rillettes really stood out but thats not to knock the other dishes which were also great. Just some of the dishes I was not used to.  While sitting there I eyed up a few of the other customer's dishes that went past and some of the mains looked mouth watering so I am already planning my next visit to get this place the extra star it deserves.  The location of the restaurent is just past west of college and ossington, and with a wooden low lighting ambience this place is suitable for just about any occasion which was demonstrated by our group and the range of other customers coming in.  There is a patio outside which was not being used during this cold weather and I was also told that Redfish have also started doing brunch on Sundays.  Overall a great experience in find seafood dining and props to Ken S for putting me in touch with this place."}
{"text":"Excellent.  We had the chef's bored (pun!), which is basically a board of assorted sashimis, the rainbow trout tartare, the whitefish, the arctic char, and sticky toffee pudding. All were very tasty and well-executed, but I'd have to highlight the whitefish entree: the romesco sauce it came with was perfect, and I was close-my-eyes-and-smile-happy eating it. Sticky toffee pudding was also brilliant. Prices, although not unreasonable, are also not cheap (10+ for apps, $20-30 for entrees, $8 for desserts, and around $10 for alcohol).  Service was almost too friendly, but no complaints. Ambiance was nice - it's a good place for friends with cash to blow or a casual-yet-expensive date (if there is such thing). Big points though for the sustainability clause - it's something that not enough restaurants focus on, and I always feel better eating meat when I know it comes from a conscientious place.  Overall, Food vs price: 4/5 Service & ambo: 5/5  I will be back when I have some extra dough and a hankering for some good, guilt-free seafood."}
{"text":"Waitress was terrible.   She tried to boss us into ordering what she thought was best, and was visibly disappointed that we did not follow her advice.  Food portions are very small for the money they charge.   Do not go here unless you wish to spend a long time waiting for service."}
{"text":"I came here for Fish Fry Sunday which features family-style platters of pan fried, cornmeal crusted fish with sides.  Redfish is a 100% sustainable seafood restaurant and everything is made in-house.    Chef David Friedman (formerly of Table 17 and Fish Bar) mans the kitchen and tells me that the menu changes quite frequently because he \"gets bored\" easily.    In keeping up with the trend of \"eating local\" the menu changes to adapt to what's in season.  Tonight we had perch, smelt and rainbow trout with sides of beans, mixed greens and mashed potato.  I often opt out of ordering seafood at a restaurant because I always find it overcooked, but chef Friedman knows what he's doing.  Every piece of fish was tender, flaky and juicy without being overly oily.  The wine list offers up a healthy selection and I managed to settle for a glass of the Meglomaniac Narcissist Riesling which was great.  I will definitely be back for brunch as the menu looks really good!"}
{"text":"Yuck!  Maybe I just don't like cajun food and fish though?!"}
{"text":"Good food, very good service.  Gives one the feel of the south without going overboard...  I tend to hang out in the bar area seating even when I go there to eat... decent menu, the calimari is good...."}
{"text":"Thanks to Bobby N. for organizing a UYE at Redfish. Had it not been for Yelp, not sure when I would have had the opportunity to dine here.  At the UYE, I opted for the Chef's Menu, which showcased many of the dishes on the regular menu. The highlight were the oysters - I usually have oysters with lemon or horseradish only (simple'n'boring) ; however, Redfish took it to the next level! Oysters with jelly and green pepper, oysters with pickled watermelon ?!   With my meal, I enjoyed both a glass of red and wine. The server asked me what kind of wine I like, both glasses that he brought were bang on with my request.  Located right at College and Ossington, it is TTC accessible. That being said, you can also opt for (free) street parking.  As a seafood lover, can't wait to come back. A solid four stars."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and even greater service. The tartar app, whitefish main and arctic char main were all fantastic. Oh, and the sticky caramel toffee with cardamom ice cream was a perfect ending. We'll definitely be back soon.  Check out the Spring 2013 Edible magazine article by Redfish chef, David Friedman, on Seafood Sustainability. http://edibletoronto.com/spring-2013/a-new-wave-of-seafood-sustainability.htm"}
{"text":"I would bring a date here!  The food is Cajun style with that New Orleans motif for decor.  The service was on point (good), and seating was more than adequate!  We asked for beads to darn on ourselves ---- and they brought us some!  The food is spicy as is Cajun style and the selections are terrific.  They serve alcohol and other libations...  The location is a bit outside of Phoenix Proper, but if you are looking for that Cajun effect---This is a good place to start.    As a bonus, they gave us a gift card for $5 off our next visit...This was a nice evening to say the least...I recommend it.  Four stars: One for decor, one for how the food tasted!  One for service, and one for price (reasonable)."}
{"text":"I've been here about three times and it is on my places to go list for when I visit Chandler.  The first time I decided I should get the Redfish Plate because I figured it oughta be good since they are named after it.  It was not a disappointment, in fact was one of the best fish dinners I ever remember having.    I don't remember what I got the other times but know I enjoyed it.  I like the decor and if I remember right, they gave me some Mardi Gras necklaces I still have.  I will definitely go back next trip there."}
{"text":"Took the fabulous Ms Brooks Brothers here for an early Valentines Day dinner. I noticed it was trending well on Yelp and a 1,000 point OpenTable offer kinda tipped the balance. Really, this place is just about as perfect as you're going to get in terms of seafood, service, and atmosphere. The only thing I thought was a bit over done was the trout tartar. The berries over powered the fish flesh and it would have been nice if it was served with some bread or pita.  Full stop for the arctic char with bacon gnocchi. I'd have happily eaten a whole bowl of just the bacon gnocchi.  The sticky toffee pudding was superb. I'm finding sticky toffee pudding to the bigfoot of the dessert menu. Everyone claims to have enjoyed an amazing sticky toffee pudding at some place or knew a friend who has enjoyed it but I've always come up empty in my quest of finding this life transforming sticky toffee pudding. And I've been to England for the sticky toffee pudding."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and so was the food. I think visiting during Earth Hour made it even better. The ambiance was even more quiet. We had the quail, shrimp and grits, and trout rillette. All were superb."}
{"text":"This place is over-hyped.  The size of their seafood hot dog was an absolute joke as well as the accompanying \"salad\" for around $15.  We were still hungry after eating eating this snack.  Otherwise the place is average with slightly slow service, given that they only had one waitress working."}
{"text":"Delicious higher priced cuisine. Red Fish is a fabulous and high quality restaurant. Went here tonight for dinner with my family, and thoroughly enjoyed the rich food and excellent service. Goodness, I am way more full than I need to be right now- but the portions were just right.   The restaurant was packed(probably because a lot of restaurants are closed tonight since tomorrow is Family Day) so I'm glad I made reservations via Open Table a couple of days ago.  Despite this, the wait for our main courses was about 1.5 hours.  While we were waiting for our order the waitress brought over some sourdough bread, and butter (twice- since the wait was so long). Ask for the olive oil with the sourdough- you won't be disappointed; it is exquisite.   We started with the Fried Smelts, and they did not disappoint. Oh god, so good. Do order these. This was the first time I had smelts. I also had the Lobster Bisque, which is to die for. For the main, I had the Arctic Char, minus the bacon. The fish was succulent, and the gnocchi was yummy. Really enjoyed it.  My brother had the Lake Huron Whitefish, and my Dad had the Miso Noodles(since he's vegetarian). I tried a bit of his whitefish, and the rometto sauce accompanying it was delicious. The Arctic char doesn't require a sauce, since it is extremely juicy,  but I still wish there was some sort of spice to it. I would go for the Whitefish if I had a choice.   The Miso Noodles- well, according to my dad, it could have been Mr. Noodles and he wouldn't know the difference. Obviously, not a restaurant for vegetarians. :) Anyway, great place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This placed closed a while ago! When they were open, they had great happy hour hurricanes and deep fried pickles!  Regular menu seemed overly pricey.  Oh well...gone now!"}
{"text":"all i remember was ....food was sooooo goooood.  the blackened fish is the BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with three other twenty something ladies as a girls night out dinner. Each of us ordered a main (my spaghetti was perfectly done and deliciously flavoured) and we split a great bottle of wine. The most difficult part of the night was deciding what to order! Literally everything on the menu sounded amazing. I would also like to comment on the service, our server was knowledgeable and gave great advice on our choices. The delicious food combined with amazing service made for a wonderful evening. What was better is each of us cost conscious (Read Shoe addicted) girls were able to walk out with a bill of $50 tax and tip included. Overall this was a perfect setting for a great girls night out."}
{"text":"So how is a Brunch experience at Redfish, Toronto's only 100% sustainable seafood restaurant? Amazing...  The vibe at Redfish is laid back and easygoing on a Sunday afternoon. Great place to hang out and catch up with friends or share quality time with families.   I just love my Octopus Harsh Egg Benny ($14). My two eggs were perfectly poached with such lovely runny yolks and of course the octopus and potatoes all chopped up by hands in such small pieces were cook with perfect bite. I can eat a whole mountain of this any day...  House Smoked Salmon ($6) for the table to share was soft and lightly smoked.   Bloody Caesar ($5) definitely well balanced as a \"Hungover/Morning After\" drink. I love how it was full of fresh horseradish... But I wish for a little more vodka.  I tried the Steak and Eggs ($16) and Duck Wings & Waffles ($13) which are good choices if your table mates are not fish/seafood eaters. They were surprisingly nicely done: Steak cooked medium rare and tender went well with the garlicky chimichurri sauce!  Eating at Redfish you know that you are dinning in a place that is so personal and people here (owners/chef: Jamie & David) really cares about what they are doing, serving, down to the smallest details. And at a patron, you feels good that you are eating local, sustainable, healthy and food that prepared with love....  I can't wait to come back to Redfish for some FISH! Or find a date to experience the Date Night Menu with me....."}
{"text":"Located on a corner it has a patio that faces west which meant some much needed warm sun. Inside are a collection of well dressed tables with napkins and tables. At the back, a small bar and a kitchen. It features a simple menu printed on card focused on sustainable fish. There were a selection of appetizers, small dishes and mains. There was obviously a great deal of attention to the styling of the restaurant and the menu (although not the patio) which was reflected in the prices.   We ordered a selection of dishes curious about the quality and quantity of the food given the price. First to arrive was a petite plate of sourdough bread, that was freshly baked. Kudos to the chef for making his own bread. But while the bread was tasty it did not have a great crumb. It had not achieved that magical leavened quality one expects from homemade bread. This meant that the original loaf was tiny resulting in tiny bite sized slices that did not bode well for the rest of the meal. The bread serving helps stage the meal. It sets the tone for what follows and with Redfish the valiant although meagre portion of poorly leavened bread was indeed an indication of what followed. The plating that followed was precious and overpriced, like one finds in too many Toronto restaurants. It is almost as if they believe they can overcharge for small delicate portions that are presented in a precious manner. It is laudable that the owners of Redfish want to encourage the use of sustainable fish, but the precious servings left us wanting more. We have so much to learn from European bistros and tavernas which can serve quality food and ingredients in a manner that is relaxed, comfortable and priced accordingly."}
{"text":"Even with a GROUPON, the service, food and ambiance were great!  We'd never even heard of this restaurant but we're certainly fans now.  Our party feasted on oyster stew, grilled sardines and octopus to start.  Following that deliciousness, we enjoyed our entrees of Arctic char, white fish and chioppino.  Every dish was done to perfection and the portion sizes were perfect.  I wasn't a lover of the goat cheese semifreddo but others in my party loved it.  However, the sticky toffee pudding was stellar.  Oh em gee - you cannot pass up this dessert.  A huge portion of yumminess drenched in the most incredible sauce.    Apparently, Red Fish also does a great Sunday brunch.  We browsed the menu and can't wait to enjoy a Sunday morning in this rustic but cozy atmosphere.  So glad Red Fish offered coupons on Groupon and made we aware of this charming restaurant.  We'll definitely be returning soon!"}
