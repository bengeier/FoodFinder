{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. Amazing taste and ingredients. And if you love wine you'll love the place. No reservation so good luck with the line."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times by myself while I have been working in Montreal and it has continued to amaze and delight me. I give that staff full freedom to choose what excites them or the kitchen. On Monday night I took my family there and they could not believe the quality of food and wine. It is a sensational spot. The vegetables dishes are amazing. Let yourself be guided by the staff and not by what you have always eaten."}
{"text":"I love this place, especially sitting out back on the terrasse. Servers are friendly and laid back. Seating outside is at long communal tables, so count on getting to know your neighbours. Wine list is all private imports I believe, let your server suggest though. Top dishes are the ham with Avonlea cheese and beurre noisette and the cauliflower with chicken skin."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed by this restaurant. We were looking forward to eating at Joe Beef but it was not opened yet so their waitstaff referred us to their sister restaurant which serves wine and small plates. Our waiter was very nice and friendly and gave us some recomendations. We ordered 3 small plates to start thinking we would order more later. We selected the snow crab, clams casino, and the rotisserie cauliflower. The first 2 were very disappointing. The snow crab came with a dipping sauce that was nothing to write home about. The clams casino didn't seem to have much clam. The one highlight would be the rotisserie cailiflower. That was very tasty and unique and the only reason I give this place 2 stars. Very over priced. Left us wanting more."}
{"text":"Outstanding.....

Stopped in for share plates, on a casual Thursday. We asked the waitress to bring us a couple exciting dishes. The celery root with anchovy vinaigrette was something we would not specifically order but was stunned at the sweetness of the root vegetable and the perfect overtones of fat and acidity from the vinaigrette.

Winner was the Guinea Fowl Confit (apparently sourced from a northern Quebec farm) so impressive we ordered a second helping, The fat was completely rendered out, left with a moist wine soaked dark meat. Memories of a 5* Coq Au Vin.

Wine list was approachable and reasonably priced. Different, inspiring, engaging and impressive"}
{"text":"Best wine bar in Montreal! The servers are really passionate about wine and food, and take great care of you. We went in, briefly explained what kind of experience we wanted, and they took care of the rest. They have very unique wines and the food was also unique and delicious, everything was paired extremely well. 

Unfortunately they don't take reservations, but it is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing experience. The single star goes to the locale & our waiter. But the host/maître d's two wine suggestions were terribly amateurish. The vegetarian dishes were bland and uninspiring. The carnivore dishes were certainly the tastier ones and elicit another half star. It feels like this is just another Montreal restaurant earning a reputation based on its brand rather than the product. 1.5 stars."}
{"text":"I know we were getting quality but it felt overpriced. 

The waitstaff was helpful and attentive, we got 3 different plates. Nothing too special about the snow crab or clams casino. I love crab, this felt well prepared but underwhelming. The real treat for us was the cauliflower. That was a new experience for me and I enjoyed it a lot. 

The wine felt incredibly overpriced. I tried two of their reds and didn't care much for either. Not wanting to spend a whole more money to be let down, I left feeling a bit hungry."}
{"text":"We went for dinner last friday. We didn't do reservation so we had to wait about 25 minutes, not bad for a friday night at this hour... Anyway, we
Got the table at the front, we were 3 people and we were seat in a small table (usually for 2), so we didn't have enough space.
The wine list is ok, but in my opinion, a bit overprice.
We didn't look at the menu, but the waitress offer to chose by us so we did it like like that. The food was amazing, small plates full of taste. Perfect for the wine bar ambiance also.
Finally, the dessert were delicious and in a good size. Perfect to share if you wish.
I give 3 stars instead of 4, not for the food, but I feel it was a bit expensive. We ending up paying $75 each with only one bottle of wine.
Good experience to go on a date or hang out with friends, but not to go more than once."}
{"text":"We visited Le Vin Papillon on a whim while visiting Montreal for a wedding. The place was packed when we showed up, but we got a table fairly quickly for a Saturday night. The space is fairly small, but with a large patio out back, and gorgeously decorated. The menu is written on a chalkboard near the front, so prepare to bother someone with your phone to take a picture if you're not sitting under it. 

The restaurant seems to emphasize roasted and seasoned vegetables, tasty things piled on top of bread, and uniquely prepared meats - we had chicken wings that were served in a particularly flavourful vinegar-like soup. Because we were a group of 5, it made splitting the dishes a bit awkward, so I would probably recommend the place more for couples who aren't fussy about getting messy at the table. And who aren't on a first date. 

My only trouble with the place was their wine program, which really should be reworked a little more carefully, considering this is a wine-focused restaurant. Le Vin Papillon definitely seems on board with the current trend of featuring natural or biodynamic wines from lesser-known or overlooked French appellations, orange wines from Italy and other obscure bottles. While this in itself is good, lists where little is familiar to the usual drinker need a good server to guide customers to the right choice. Since the cheapest bottle on the 30-some list was $40 (marked up from $15 at retail), whatever you're ordering needs to be well-considered. Unfortunately, the place is too loud and the servers too flat out to really help in the matter, so I resorted to Wikipedia. 

Similarly, their glass program is limited and seems to change frequently. I ordered a second glass of Chenin Blanc after our table's bottle ran dry. When the bill came, it was revealed to be $18 for a 3-ounce pour. Had I stupidly ordered two glasses, I might as well have bought the whole bottle at the store. Seeing as you might want multiple glasses of wine (rather than one catch-all bottle) to go with the various dishes you order, a $8-$14 10-wine by-the-glass list would make much more sense. 

Overall, the service was swift and to the point, if a little grumpy. It's definitely worth stopping into, if you're from/dropping into Montreal, but you'd best start drinking before you get to the restaurant until they shape up their wine program."}
{"text":"Not: this place ONLY offers organic wine. Overall very average. We were really looking forward to a great Meal and wine tasting pairings ; but just got very average wine and average cold tapas . Cold bread. Tapas were too salty or too bland or too oily...  Although service was very good! But no consideration on food and wine pairing . No wow effect at all. Just overall disappointed."}
{"text":"Another restaurant from the owner of Joe Beef and Liverpool house. The same incredible good food and outstanding selections of wines. The food comes in \"large\" tapas size plates.  The variety of different food plates is also very good so something for everyone.  An expansion is underway with the restaurant taking over a recently vacated space. Hopefully this will mean they will take reservations when they have the larger space. Only bad thing is wine was pricey. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"What a treat!! A super affordable, friendly and fun wine spot! The food is beyond... just simply delectable, with seasonal specialties. The wine... wow... the wine!! A stunning selection of world masters with a great array of by-the-glass choices. I still can't believe how affordable it was. Friendly and super pro service, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Un délice! Allez-y et laissez-vous conseiller par les serveurs qui connaissent bien les menus. Un restaurant créatif et différent des menus typiques \"tartare, steak, huître, guédille\" auxquels nous sommes devenus habitués."}
{"text":"More of a tapas joint than a full course restaurant.  You need to order min 1.5 dishes per person to not eave hungry. The dishes arrive at 5-10 min intervals so if you're more than 3, you get a couple of mouthfuls of a dish and then end up waiting for the next.  No menus; only chalk board out of sight for most.  Waiters only provided limited info on dishes and that after asking.  Food overpriced but the wine was ridiculously expensive ($17/glass for a mediocre wine with no info from staff).  Overall, this place feels like it is exploiting its association with Joe Beef to overcharge and under-deliver. Won't be going back or recommending."}
{"text":"I love this place! We went for dinner last week and as it was busy  we waited for 25' while enjoying a glass of nice white wine. It was so worth it. The wine selection was amazing. We were lucky to sit outside. We ordered tapas a la carte and the waiter was super friendly and helpful as I'm vegan and there weren't any choices on the menu. The kitchen staff made wonderfully delicious dishes for me. I was sooo happy! Warmly recommended."}
{"text":"A night of absolute perfection, with just one minor imperfection. Let me explain why!

Le Vin Papillion is owned by David McMillan who is also the same owner as Joe Beef. Which happens to be one of the most known and best rated restaurants both in Montreal, and Canada. Having that in mind, I had full confidence that my stomach I are were mostly likely going to be very pleased. Indeed we were!

Upon walking in at 5:30pm on A Saturday evening, I was thrilled to see that I could sit in a table for two right away. I do strongly advice all of you that you go early, since space is limited and it gets full fast. Real fast!

While waiting for a friend of mine to arrive, I had the time to observe and analyze the ambiance and atmosphere. It took me about two minutes to realize that I was falling in love with the place already. I know, dinner was not served, yet!  However the lights were dimmer, the restaurant was cozy, and warm along with a lovely, light smell of a woodsy indoor grill. With a perfect view of the open kitchen. Which gives you a good glimpse of their hard, dedicated, and talented kitchen staff. 
 Within a minute a very kind, and polite waiter was kind enough to offer me something to drink while waiting for my friend. Also asking me if I needed anything and if my table was alright for me. Luckily all those questions had a positive answer of mine. Which made me think, Wow! the service here is spectacular within minutes of walking in. Sadly, I can't say the same thing about many other restaurants I've been to. 

Five minutes later now that my friend had arrived(We were a table of two) Time to talk and discuss what shall we order? 
We've decided to order a few difference different dishes, in order to have a taste of many of their dishes.  Now this is the moment where I will mention the one, and only imperfection I did not enjoy about our dinner experience. 
When it came time to look at their menu, we were told to go and look at the blackboard, and take a photo of it with our smartphones. Indeed it's a different concept than most restaurants, but a slightly impractical concept as well.  While the menu items were written in a lovely font, it's a clear font. Along with the dimmed lights, it didn't make it any easier to read. The small light that illuminated the blackboard, was bright enough only to illuminate a small section of the blackboard, not the entire thing. The blackboard is situated in a bit of an backward position nearby the tables. So if people are sitting there or standing there, you will need to ask them to move. If you are sitting by the kitchen as we were, you will need to stand up and go read the blackboard in the traffic of the waiters/waitress.

Now that I'm standing, and looking at their menu, it's a very helpful thing that I have a strong knowledge of foods, and ingredients. As the menu does not have a description of the ingredients or what each item is. They are simply written with a name. That's it. Therefore if you are unfamiliar with the names or what each item is, you will need to be given a verbal explanation and remember them. A true challenge, but worth it. 

Now that we are walking back to our table with a photo of the menu in our smartphone, let's investigate the choices and choose. 

We began by ordering four different dishes. Sliced cooked ham from La Petite Bourgogne. Along with shavings of a very delicious, flavorful, and wonderful texture cheese. Oh my.. Oh my! We simply didn't talk for about 10 minutes while we were madly in love with this dish. This is just the beginning!
We also decided to try the \"Champignons Champignons\" Yes, that literally translates to mushrooms, mushrooms\" So we asked for a brief explanation. They were delicate, extremely flavorful, and juicy small caps of mushrooms with an outstanding stuffing inside.  Another \"WOW\" of a dish. 
Now to the more original, and unique dishes.  A sturgeon(fish) pâté with a lovely smoked paprika oil, and creamy as can be. Served along side of friend gnocchi. I already said wow to the previous dishes.. But.. WOW again! 
To add a bit of a different twist, we've decided to order the roasted cauliflower. Hmmmm we were feeling so so about this dish. The combination of pickled raw onions, with the warm but crunchy cauliflower. It was just \"OK\" Not a wow factor but not a complete failure either. 

The dessert... Chocolate perfection in every bite. A tender buttery crust, filled with an outstanding dark chocolate filling flavored with bergamot, which is a citrus fruit quite similar to an orange but with a more floral taste and less sour. An absolute perfect flavour to pair it with chocolate. Finished by fresh whipped cream and a light sprinkle of chocolate. 

We had moments of silence, moments of goosebumps, and perhaps a slight orgasm here and there? Clearly the dinner did it's job beautifully. We can't wait to go back again, and again. 

Bravo to David McMillan, and his entire Vin Papillion staff for an outstanding dinner!"}
{"text":"Vin Papillion is an excellent concept. Unlike its sister restaurants down the street VP does not take reservations, so you can go on a whim and there is no need to plan your dinning schedule 3 months in advance. The resto has just expanded so waiting times at peak periods should be reduced. I probably shouldn't be saying this, but if you show up early or late in the evening there is a rarely a wait for a table.

I think that the food and atmosphere are terrific. They have a really nice terrace in the back where they have a charcoal BBQ. The menu is written on a chalkboard by the front door and is updated regularly (I've uploaded a pic of a recent version). Dishes are small tapas style offerings, great for sharing with friends. Some of my favorites from recent visits include the grilled calamari, the Spanish style toast with tomatoes & muscles and the corn profiteroles. Special mention go to the profiteroles as they are a truly unique dish. They really mean it when they say corn. They are made with corn flour, topped with popcorn and what I think is some sort of a corn syrup based sauce. The taste of corn is very strong and unique, much less sweet than you would expect. Even if you don't enjoy the corniness, you will certainly appreciate the unique flavour that has been created. 

Oh, and of course there is a great wine list."}
{"text":"Super restaurant relaxe avec plein de petits plats spéciaux qui nous font découvrir des goûts hors du commun. Et des vins aussi hors du commun à découvrir."}
{"text":"Called up Joe Beef our first night in Montreal back in October. They were full but they referred us to their sister restaurant to dine in. 

On a Friday night, le vin papillon was packed and lively. Dark & elegant decor. We were seated within 15mn of waiting for a table. While waiting,  we enjoyed a glass of wine from their extensive list. The servers were busy but still very attentive. In fact, they would occasionally sit and spark up conversation with diners. 

Their seasonal menu is written on the chalkboard wall so they ask you to take a good look at it or take a picture before sitting down. We had no idea what to order. Thankfully, our waitress was very helpful with guiding us. 

Here are the highlights of what we had. Their best dishes are the ones featuring a roasted veggie. 
**Rotisserie Cauliflower (one of the best veggie dishes I've had) 
**chicken wings (delicious) 
**Eggplant dip 
**Jambon (least favorite, too basic) 
**Stuffed plums (my husband really enjoyed them) 

Really great atmosphere, good quality food. Prices were a little high end, especially for the wine glasses."}
{"text":"Loved this place. It was my favorite meal in our week long visit to Montreal. Small plates. Very cutting edge, inventive food but absolutely delicious and joy-filled dining experience. Reminds me of our meal at The Fat Duck in the way it made you think of food in a different way."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Le Vin Papillon for a while now, but the fact that they don't accept reservations made me keep putting it off, because I hate to wait in line for a table. One day we decided to give it a try and were super lucky to find a table available right away. Their menu is all made of small plates, which I find great, because you get to taste several different dishes. And in a place as delicious as Le Vin Papillon, it's just perfect to get to try as many dishes as you can. One was better than the other.... And the cheese plate was the grand finale, for sure. It comes with maple buttered toast, nuts and a delicious cookie that match perfectly the cheese."}
{"text":"Our first meal in Montreal! I was really bummed that there was so much traffic/border crossing delay that we couldnt make our Liverpool reservation but we decided to try this place since it was just before 6:30 on a Saturday and luckily there was no wait. When we left there was a huge wait so definitely go early. Our server was really friendly and helpful since their menu is really annoying (on a chalkboard that we all had to walk over to read because we were in the window seat) and also in French. 

We ordered a bunch of dishes and one of our favorites was the thinly sliced ham plate with brown butter and cheese. Wow - didn't think I'd love non-prosciutto ham so much. We also had a smoked fish dish that my sister loved, and a roasted cauliflower dish. I am ambivalent to roasted cauliflower but one of our friends liked it a lot. The smoked carrots pastrami was very interesting - not something I feel compelled to order again but definitely worth trying. The one kind of disappointing dish was the beef tongue, which was not as tender as we had hoped.

If I'm ever back in Montreal I would definitely want to try more of the Joe Beef restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is not shy about being one of the best in Montreal and nor should it be. The service, food, and ambience is impeccable. We ordered one of each from the specials - the sturgeon with gnocchi puffs, eggplant dip from the bbq, the lamb ribs, and the 2 vegetable dishes from the kitchen (fern pasta and carrot éclair which were both outstanding!) The chocolate tart/macaroons were a nice finish to a wonderful night. 

I for one will surely be back when visiting Montreal again !"}
{"text":"My new favorite place in Montreal. The food is very fish, seafood and vegetable heavy, but it is so unique and so delicately prepared and spiced. All organic and bio-dynamic wines, bubbles and great service by friendly, knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"Really great experience!! Honestly, my boyfriend and I tried to find something to say about it, like an actual constructive critic... can't find anything! The waiter was nice and helpful, the food was delicious. It is not cheap yet not overpriced for what you get. I would recommend it without even thinking about it! They don't have a printed menu. Everything is on boards on the walls because they're changing their menu regularly. We will definitely go back to try more food and wine!"}
{"text":"Bon si c'etait possible je donnerais 3.5 au vin papillon ! Premierement, je dois avouer que la place est tres belle et l'ambiance et cool aussi ! Par contre je n'ai pas vraiment aimé comment le menu est présenté ! Ils sont très bon pour formuler des phrases impressionnantes sur leur ardoise pour que finalement le plat soit tres simple et même parfois decevant ! 

Les aliment sont de qualité, mais le résultat n'est pas impressionnant ! De plus, le serveur nous a recommandé 4 petit plat pour faire un repas complet ! Si vous avez un bonne appetit comme moi, oubliez leurs conseil ! Je suis sortit du restaurant affamé ! 

Finalement le vin est tres bon mais à 12$ le verre il est difficle d'en apprecier plus d'un ! 

Je ne retournerai pas a ce restaurant , le mot qui le qualifie le mieux selon moi c'est : ok"}
{"text":"Cute, funky environment. We were seated right away inside. Seating was extremely cramped, music was too loud, and it was pretty warm. There are no menus so you have to get up from your seat to read the chalkboard on the wall. We ordered 4 items to share. The squash blossoms stuffed with ham were divine.  The smoked sturgeon spread was good.  The barbecued chicken was crispy on the outside while moist and flavorful on the inside, but a very small portion. They kept bringing us things we did not order. And our 4th item never arrived."}
{"text":"Spectacular wine bar full of good grub. The rotisserie cauliflower with fried chicken skin was out of this world, tomatoes and nectarines w Creme Fresh was refreshing, watermelon Jamon salad also a delight.  Occhioverde Malbec topped it off.  Magnificent way to start the evening before our main event at #joebeef.  #montreal you are a foodie's dream. Burgundy district doesn't disappoint - tons of spots in this area. Merci!"}
{"text":"One of the must visits in Montreal. Great atmosphere and vibe, food is great.

No reservation policy but we arrived at 6:30 so we're seated rather fast. Very intimate seating. Plates are small and meant for sharing - we were a group of 5 and asked the waiter to bring us 2-3 dishes at a time varying from seafood to veggies and finished with chicken. Great selection, the waiter really served us well and made sure we weren't full before bringing more plates.  Bill was very reasonable 30-35 dollars/person with tip!"}
{"text":"Lots of great vegetarian options here. The Brussels sprouts on the stalk were crisped and covered in a delicious aioli. The flatbread with eggplant and feta spread was outstanding. The servings are huge so pace yourself. The staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Voted the 4th best restaurant in Canada for 2017 I made a stop at Le Vin Papillon. It's a tapas menu so I came here as my second \"afternoon snack.\" I had a plate of raw beef, cucumber, cilantro, and Greek yogurt. While I'm not a fan of cilantro, somehow this dish was so beautifully put together that the flavours just worked and you could tell it was high quality beef. I also ordered the famous smoked carrot eclair and my.god. this was one of the most unique things I have ever tasted! The smoked carrot almost tasted like smoked salmon/ham and was cooked to the perfect texture. While I believe the carrot is suppose to be the main attraction of the dish, the eclair REALLY blew me away. It's extremely had to find a good eclair and this one was lightly crispy on the outside and deliciously moist on the inside. Took me right back to my favourite ones in Paris. I can only imagine what a delicious dessert eclair Le Vin Papillon would make!"}
{"text":"As I was on vacation, I first tried Joe Beef and Liverpool house to see if I could score a seat for one as a walk in. I found myself seated at the end of the bar at Le Vin Papillon. The beginning of an excellent night. I was plied with excellent wines I had never had, some I liked, some I didn't, some I was not sure of, but all new. I was hosted by many, but primally by a beautiful young woman born of equal parts sass and seduction. I had excellent conversation with my fellow bar dwellers until the place closed and the staff invited this middle aged fat man for drinks at a bar I honestly cannot recall. the food was excellent, the company lively and the beautiful young barmaid rebuffed my repeated offers of marriage."}
{"text":"Que dire de plus du Vin Papillon, un des meilleurs restos de Montréal à cause de l'ambiance feutrée mais sans prétention, de la qualité des vins et des plats style tapas qui sont généreux et qui mettent les légumes à l'avant plan. Aussi une superbe terrasse l'été et une clientèle  dans la trentaine, professionnelle. Aussi, pas de réservation ce qui est une bonne chose pour une resto aussi intéressant."}
{"text":"I can't speak any more positively about this restaurant. Courteous service, some of the most delicious food in all of Montreal, and a charming ambience for either a girl's night out or a romantic dinner for two. I can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Guys - this place is amazing. We decided to swing by here because we were little early for our reservation at Liverpool House, but this was easily the star of the show. It's a quite (and somewhat cramped) wine bar that offers a pretty extensive menu of wines, but the real surprise was their food). I'm not big on vegetarian food, but they make it heavenly. PLEASE GET THE Squash fried in brown butter with muhammara. IT IS AMAZING. I don't know how they did it, but every bite was sweet, tangy, and very smooth. My friend and I were contemplating ordering another one even though we had dinner reservations in an hour. Even more than Liverpool House, I think I would more excited about coming here as a great way to end the night."}
{"text":"I went back for dinner a few weeks ago and can confirm that the Joe Beef dudes done good. We ordered a few different dishes, and they were all freshly prepared and dee-licious. I should have written my review sooner because now, I can't remember what I ate other than the cheese plate. That's the trouble with aging =-D

I don't really thing you can go wrong with this place - each dish seems to be prepared with love, the menu is seasonal so you can try something new each time you stop in, and their desserts? HELLO! If you stop by for no other reason, they will be totally worth your while. The wait staff is great, and the vibe rocks. This is a great place to check out on a cold winter afternoon -  bring a book, order a glass of wine and just chillax. THEN order dinner.

If you get there around 5:30-6pm, you should be good to get a table. They don't take reservations so you want to get there early.

See my initial review for praise on their yummy desserts!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best meals I've ever had. Eat here, if you have the opportunity. I highly recommend the ham with shaved cheese. Likewise, if it's on the menu when you visit, the grilled duck heart was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant in town. The uni i had last month was off the charts phenomenonal, and every other dish was SOLID"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal.  Market fresh cuisine, with a menu that changes regularly depending on what is in season.  Everything is always amazingly fresh and simply but elegantly prepared.  The stuffed zucchini blossoms, when in season, are a must.  Serving portions are as small plates, good for sharing.  Order 3-5 per person, depending on how hungry you are.  Decor is delightfully rustic and casual.  They have a short but excellent wine list with several unusual choices, a great chance to try something new.  They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait with a glass of wine (not a real hardship) or come early to get a table."}
{"text":"Tried to go here, but \"Joe Beef\" was blocking the door reminiscing about the time he ate beef tongue with Bourdain.  Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"VERY GOOD. This is a relatively small \"wine bar\" with indoor and outdoor seating. At the time I visited they didn't have a bar license so we were required to order at least 1 food item (not a bad thing to say the least). This is one of the chalkboard bistros, so take a photo as you pass by the daily listings, otherwise you'll end up standing over random people staring at a list posted on the wall above their table. he food was really good, but be careful of time of day you visit, sometimes only cold items are available. Also, if you're lucky, you may get a tour of the garden that feeds the 3 restaurants (also including Joe Beef & Liverpool House)."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful first visit to this Little Burgundy spot with delicious wine and small plates! I enjoyed a lovely \"orange\" wine (first time having one of these!) and a sparking rose. 

For food, my friend and I shared the falafel and beet hummus, which was nice and light; scallops served with an interesting crunchy topping (not sure what it was); a half order of the very rich and delicious ham and cheese dish with brown sugar butter; and the very large and filling rotisserie cauliflower. Every dish was unique, and the mix provided a full complete meal. 

We finished with the diplomate choco-cafe which was a flavourful mousse served with cookie wafers.

For the amount of time we spent enjoying our drinks and bites and the quality of everything, the price is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for small plates and a phenomenal wine select being brought to you by the Joe Beef crew.  Try the white ham with brown butter, holy efff it's so good.  We love to sit at the bar and visit with their attentive bar staff.  Oh and the lovely decor is a bonus eh"}
{"text":"The environment alone is worth a visit. Food was exceptional- we had the ham plate with cheese and butter and veggie platter. Wine selection on point."}
{"text":"A perfect place to spend a summer Saturday night outdoors!!!  Only in Montreal you will find a gem like this. Completely unassuming atmosphere as you were dining in your own backyard with the little vegetable garden and grill.  The food was amazing.  Sliced ham and cheese on buttery cornbread in a husk.  The Spanish styled tapas potatoes with fried chives were  just the best.  We had had the grilled chicken wings.
The corn sundae for dessert was also very tasty."}
{"text":"I've been a few times, and it's always a great experience. The menu constantly changes so there's always novelty, and service is always 5 stars in my books.

We ordered a bottle of VDF Anjou Melodie en Sous-sol by Jerome Lambert (white wine), and it was nothing like what we've tasted before. Rather on the sweet side, but just dry enough to hit the spot. I may be wrong, but i dont think any of their wines can be found in the SAQ. The past few times we've been, none of the bottles had sulfite in it, and you really taste the difference.

Considering that the food changes often, it's rather irrelevant for me to describe my appreciation for them. There are only 3/5 dishes that we ordered that i'd comment on:
- celeri rave homard: we took it for the lobster description, but it's not at all what it seems; i'd give it 3/5
- betteraves bottarga: it was awesome! Such simple ingredients, but made delicious. 4/5
- saving the best for last: esturgon fumé, gnocchi fritti. This dish was off the hook, gnocchi being a kind of light bread. 5/5

Vin Papillon is always a pleasant experience, and service is always very elegant, polite, on point, and feeling all Gucci."}
{"text":"The popularity of this spot is well evidenced by the waits every time I pass by. They don't take reservations so the only way to get a table is to go super early or risk a long wait. In the summer they have a patio section out back that is great when the weather is good. 
The menu is a lot of small tastings that are really appealing - our group of 4 tried many of them and came away very satisfied - even with some picky eaters present (they were many vegetable based options so even they were happy)
Their wine selection is different than I've seen elsewhere. The atmosphere is nice and I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Interesting and creative dishes. The Seven Layer Dip is delicious as are the brussels sprouts. Lots of vegetarian options. Great service and very friendly servers and hosts. Great atmosphere and ambience right down the charming Georges Brassens soundtrack! Very reasonable prices for this type of dining experience. Small restaurant (true bistro) and no reservations but wait time at 7pm on a Friday night was about 10 minutes and it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Cool restaurant! It's nice that you don't need a reservation and they place you and serve wine as you wait! Very chill atmosphere, and good wine selection!"}
{"text":"Surprising enough I didn't mind it at all cause the scruffy-hair hipster dude server was as patient as my previous aweseome experience at Liverpool House where a cute girl sat down next to me and explain to me the entire menu and I got the expensive lobster.  Maybe my taste has changed over time...

One thing hasn't changed is that Joe Beef continues to dominate my taste buds and inspire me to dream.  This time WaYnE c. dreams of veges. In addition to some spectacular seafood to help the veges go down smooth.  May I ask you, what have you been smoking?!  CARROT! Nope, that's neither a fancy name for something you roll up nor a new cut of meat.  It's the orange stick thingy, but here they call it Carrot Eclair.

CAULIFLOWER. I think I spelled it correctly since I haven't seen it, written it, or tasted it for the past 20 years but either Le Vin Papillon grew a new breed of savoury califlower or I don't remember how it tasted like but I was completely overwhelmed by the Roasted Cauliflour with bits and pieces of chicken.

I think Le Vin Papillon may make veges taste so good that it can finally be it's own food group."}
{"text":"Un incontournable, pour la qualité des produits et l'originalité des plats. On peut y passer la soirée à déguster, à notre rythme, une myriade de saveurs, le tout agrémenté d'une excellente carte de vins."}
{"text":"I loved this spot, while I'm a fan of the whole Joe Beef thing this was so much fun, the no reservation slightly later hours meant that we could pop in for a \"dessert\" and glass of wine late night and still enjoy other parts of the night elsewhere.
Shared a fantastic clam dish with porchetta and bread crumbs and a lovely gamay. The prices can add up fast here but so worth it. Didn't try the orange wines but found that they make wonderful suggestions. Go if you have a chance."}
{"text":"It is worth the wait. Amazing tapas dishes with incredible wine pairing  will come back again and again"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Montreal, my friend and I dined here and it's one of my new regrets. I tried the ham & cheese dish based on both reviews and my waiter's recommendation. The dish was terribly over-peppered to the point that I felt like I was biting into little pebbles. I immediately informed my waiter/host so that something could be done. He said \"okay, I'll be back.\" I didn't see him until 20 more minutes. He returned, did nothing but take my plate, and gave me a bill for uneaten food. I will say that the other staff was attentive in refilling my water but if the dish is unsatisfactory, what good is replenished water?"}
{"text":"We did the tasting menu between 6 and it was amazing. Top dishes we tried were the chicken wings, cauliflower, and ham but everything was delicious. Great wine menu too!"}
{"text":"Le Vin was one of the dining highlites of my trip to Montreal. Gorgeous and professional staff serve up an array of excellent wines that must be enjoyed with a plate of food (it's part of their license apparently). Not that having to purchase food is a hardship! The assortment of small and large sharing plates are delicious. We drank dry white wine in the sunshine with a bowl of shrimp (or prawns as we call them down under) and then popped next door for dinner.

I'd only wished I had weeks to spend in Montreal so I could visit Le Vin on a number of occasions and enjoy more of their menu."}
{"text":"Great little Resto for a date or a group of friends, although tables are all very close. Food was delicious as the wine. Noise level ok."}
{"text":"I have to say that the reviews made us want to try this place but it was impossible. My husband, daughter and I went there and we were showed to a table so tiny that made it impossible for the 3 of us to eat. Not only it was tiny but it was so close to the next table that we had to touch the next person making it really uncomfortable. My husband was sitting on the bench with no table in front if him. I wish i took pictures but I was so irritated with the situation and with the fact that the server saw nothing wrong with it that I had yo leave. The entire place is so tiny and crowded ..."}
{"text":"We arrived here at 9:30pm, and it was still packed, we waited 15mins and got a bar place. They don't have any English menu, so was inconvenient for us to understand what they serve. 
However, the food was very good, even though it took long time to get your orders. And I realized this restaurant has the same owner of the Joe beef, so of course the taste is guaranteed! Lol"}
{"text":"I love this wine bar!
It has an hipster vibe to it, with menu on chalk board ( which I hate by the way, it's unacceptable, hipster or not) but the quality of the food and wines made me forget the other details. Our waitress was very helpful and ended up choosing for us since we couldn't see the damn chalk board menu. The food felt healthy but impressively tasty and paired perfectly with the wines which were all so fresh and lively. 
It is a bit expensive, and the food is in small plates to share. It might be a better option for lunch or just before a show like us than for a full diner as it can get pricey in the end. There was a good diversity in the choices even if they were limited and all very creative.

My favorite part was at the end, we took a cheese plate. We had three different kind and each and everyone of them were so flavorful. One of them, called les pouilles was particularly strong, smooth and amazing."}
{"text":"Join my voice to the chorus, what a nice experience! The move for sure is to duck out of work early, get here at 4:30 like we did and the black banquets are wide open and the friendly, funny, wise, calm woman who seats you and knows all the wines and food by heart will give you the corner of your choice. 

The counters are piled with fresh homemade bread and beautiful cheese wheels under glass domes. Take a photo of the blackboards on your way in to read at your seat and leisure, one is entirely delicious food and the other is wine by the bottle, but really based on my experience your best bet is just chatting with the amazing wait staff about what you feel like eating and what they are excited to be serving that night and you won't be led astray. 

Just down the street from Joe Beef and Liverpool this lovely little slip of a room is tasteful and perfect and calm and bright and I love it. Expensive but not crazy and so totally worth it when every bite is dreamy. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Un excellent choix pour les fans de vin! Le concept du restaurant est génial: des petits plats à partager qui varient selon la saison et bien sûr, une fantastique carte de vin. Le menu constitué d'ingrédients et de légumes hyper frais est riche en saveurs et se marie très bien avec les vins. Le décor est rustique-chic, l'ambiance romantique et le service impeccable! De plus, si vous avez la chance d'y aller en été, vous allez tomber sous le charme de la terrasse tout simplement féerique.

Si vous voulez manger et boire pour la peine, attendez vous à avoir une facture assez élevée. Ceci dit, c'est toujours bien de se payer la traite une fois de temps en temps... vous le méritez!

Je suggère fortement de vous y rendre relativement tôt, car l'endroit est souvent bondé. Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Didn't mean to come here, and came here under weird circumstances + I was sleepy from previously consumed wine, so probably didn't have the best time....but overall it was a good experience.

Everyone told us we had to go to Joe Beef when in Montreal, but it didn't fit in out itinerary so we tried to at least sneak in for a drink at 11:30pm since the hours listed 12am as closing.  They did have room at the bar for us, but due to some weird Montreal laws they couldn't serve us a drink without food, and the kitchen was already closed, so they sent us to Le Vin Papillon.

Same stupid rule applied here, but their kitchen was open later, so we were able to just order something small and get more wine.  

The menu was completely in French, but the bartenders were helpful and we both found wines we liked.  We ordered an appetizer that was described as \"light\" with zero intentions of eating it since we were so full, but could satisfy the weird laws.  Naturally I tried just one bite, and was in love!! Some sort of Celery Fritter which was amazingly light, topped with grated cheese....sounds quite horrible, but this was like eating perfectly seasoned clouds!! 

Definitely would return for a proper meal!"}
{"text":"Le Vin Papillon is a must visit when in Montreal. They don't take reservations, but that's ok, they will bring you wine as you wait, and their food is well worth it. Our first visit we sat at the bar and had great service with perfect wine recommendations...and when we returned a year later had the same fantastic server. Our first visit we tried the pickled zucchini, kale ricotta tort, sausages and greens, and the ham with butter. 

That last dish...it is thinly sliced ham, melted butter, and grated parmesan cheese. Doesn't really sound like much, but honestly, that dish is what brought us back for a return visit. The ham is so perfectly textured, it was just as good a year later, the second time around! Our dessert was caramel popcorn, it was perfect. An excellent, laid back experience by the Joe Beef team. It is worth a trip to Montreal just to visit this awesome wine bar."}
{"text":"Sans vous le déconseiller, il y a quelques spécificités à cet endroit que j'ai moins aimé! D'abord, le restaurant est absolument charmant! Ambiance intime, bar à vins, peu de tables donc peu de monde et de bruit! Vraiment, au premier regard, le restaurant a tout pour plaire ! Moins conseillé si vous êtes en gang d'amis! 

Par contre, les prix sont élevés! Le verre de vin coûte 15-18$ ! Comme le menu est sous forme de plats à partager, nous nous sommes faits suggérer 4 plats à deux! Sans expliquer le menu, le serveur répondra à vos questions sur les plats ! Petit conseil: FAITES VOUS CONSEILLER ! Nous avons pris des plats qui finalement avait l'air bien meilleur que ce qu'ils étaient en réalité (boeuf cru de topinambour frit  et foie = tartare de boeuf avec patates frites) De plus, ils les servent un peu n'importe comment, nous avons donc eu un premier service avec le tartare et les saucisses au bleu, et le deuxième service était composé d'un os à moelle et d'une toast aux champignons!! Bien que les plats soient excellents, ils sont minuscules! Nous avions encore faim à la fin! 

Bref, un bel endroit, mais un peu trop cher pour les plats servis!"}
{"text":"Our last spot to check out for the night. Even though we were stuffed from dinner, we decided to walk over to Le Vin Papillon to grab a drink. This is the third restaurant of the Joe Beef empire (their other spot is Liverpool House) and they're thriving on all fronts. Love the outside decor.

The moment you walk in, you're greeted to the loveliest meat slicer. The inside is warm, inviting and ambient. There's no other way to put it but cozy and intimate. Took a peek at their backyard terrace. Gorgeous and packed to the brim. It was a perfect night to sit outside and enjoy. Those Christmas-esque lights are adorable.

No real menus here. Everything is handwritten on their massive chalkboards. Same thing for their drinks menu; wine, beers and ciders. LVP only has a partial license so you have to order at least one plate (but only one) if you're drinking. There was only spots at the bar so we snagged the last two chairs.

- Rosee ($11.00 each) - the rose was just like our bartender described it; light, summery and very drinkable.

- Chocolate tartan ($12.00) - our dessert that we \"shared\" but more like I ate it because Cbear couldn't fathom eating anymore. The chocolate tartin was palatable. Hard and crusty on the bottom, lighter on top with fresh strawberries and raspberries.

Cool spot to grab a drink before or after dinner. Our neighbours were drinking here before their lateeee dinner reservations at Joe Beef. I'll have to check out their backyard terrace next time."}
{"text":"So loved this meal tonight. Favorites were celery and lobster. So flavorful. The ham with cheese was delicious. The corn foie gras. Pork. Was highly recommended and great. Someone else made a great suggestion of snapping a photo of the menu so you can just read it back at your table. Great idea. Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"First off, we were from out of town trying to head to Joe Beef, without reservations, but we arrived an hour before they opened.  We went here and were delightfully treated to the nicest waiter(whom I forget his name) who basically curated our eating experience. Is this what they do here? 

Mind you I couldn't read the menu from my seat but I was pleased as to how attentive this dude was. 

When time was running out I told him that we were just trying to get two seats and offered to help. He got us those seats and settled the bill....

I just wish we didn't eat so much food here and went to Joe Beef with virgin stomachs but not really.

This place was amazing."}
{"text":"Farm to table at its best. This place was recommend by a friend and it was recommended as a go to place in one of Montreal's papers. The entire menu was in French and the server was more than willing to translate and help us order. Small
plates, so if you're looking for heavy food, this is not the place. The food was light and tasty and you'll leave satisfied. Just wished we could have gotten an outdoor seat. President Obama and the Prime Minister recently ate here!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. 
Everything was so simple but flavorful and delicious.
We sat in the cozy and cute backyard in beautiful weather.  

We started with a yummy aperitif cocktail and proceeded to enjoy some grilled herbal chicken, a cheese and nuts plate and also a corn and cheese curds appetizer.  

I think about the food all the time coz it was so good!"}
{"text":"Serving privately imported bio wine paired with tapas size sharing plates makes this an ideal place to bring a date or a small group of friends.
We went carte blanche with wine by the glass and did not have any regrets; especially with the more 'vin nu' selection made by our waiter. Tasted like the farm, but in a good way. Generous pours :) 
As for the food, while being affiliated with JoeBeef, this is not the place for meat lovers. Could be called JoeVeggie, but trust me when I say that the veggies plates are to die for! My favorite dish of this whole journey so far was a 7 layer veggie dip, it was the bomb!
Being that it's Quebec's seafood season, the restaurant also had their own selection of fresh arrivages. Not the highlight of the evening but nice freshness to the dishes."}
{"text":"Been to Joe Beef and had to go to VP .. we did chefs table for 10 and they just kept bringing food and wine until we were stuffed. We had mostly vegan fare.. eggplant caviar (no caviar), beet salad, Brussels sprouts .. we did have the short ribs and the ham and cheese with brown butter and black pepper (a must!). For sure it's worth the hype. Service is amazing."}
{"text":"What a beautiful space by the JB Crew...

Unfortunately we went for a drink only as we had reservations down the street... but split a smoked carrot appetizer (you have to order some food if you sit), with some lovely Rose and Gamay

The backyard is absolutely stunning and would definitely go for longer period to eat and drink just back there."}
{"text":"We went to Le Vin Papillon on our last night of vacation in Montréal, looking for a phenomenal meal, and weren't disappointed. As vegetarians, we were a little leery of the fact that there was no menu online, but we needn't have been. Vegetables take center stage in most of the dishes here, and even those dishes with meat in them the staff were happy to make vegetarian for us.

The highlights were the simplicity of the dishes, the fresh flavors, and the great service. By using super fresh, high quality produce, they avoid needing to add much to each dish to make it shine. We especially liked the aioli with vegetables (sounds simple, but was really great), the rotisserie cauliflower, and the cheese plate. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"+++
Open late when Joe Beef isn't
Idk what sparkling wine I ordered, it was similar to cava, but it wasn't cava. But it was a gamble that paid off
bilingual staff
I don't think I've tasted 3 tastes that complemented each other as the cuisse/mustard/slaw combo

++
Service; waitresses are very friendly. They will literally sit down and chat with you about dishes, or give you information on whatever you like (I've seen this done twice, and it they did it with me!)
Cauliflower with chicken was the bomb, and the crispy chicken skin was the best part
We really liked the eggplant dip
90s hip hop soundtrack was cool

+
Stuffed plums was great, because it utilized the natural sweetness of the plums, so it was nit overly sugary and overly dense

-
- The jambon was pretty much just ham and cheese, like from a sandwich, without the bread

TIPS:
If there's a wait, which there most likely will be, take a picture of menu, or persue te menu and make a game plan before seating
FYI (four meals, 3 wines, dessert) was roughly $130 including tip"}
{"text":"Took my husband here mid afternoon for a drink, the wine was excellent, but our waitress was unbelievably rude, to the point of ruining our evening. At no point were we told that we were obligated to order food, we even mentioned it was our first time there. She pretty much said we just had to know coming in and that we weren't allowed to leave without ordering food. This was 4pm, so we weren't really hungry - she suggested the most expensive food and just like that $70 when we just wanted 2 glasses of wine. Ironically I run a recommendation website, so I know for a fact there are better places where for that kind of money, you can have excellent food/drinks and you're treated right."}
{"text":"Great vibes, great wine list great food. I was lucky to get the last table on a Saturday, server was spot on on recommendations, since we cant read french, eclair smoked tuna and clams were all amazing wish we could have stayed longer food prices were 10-15$. Will recommend and will be back"}
{"text":"VIBE 
This place reminds me of Paris. Straight from the mirrors to the banquettes to the layout of the restaurant. Paris, Paris, Paris. In the very best way. Everyone knows Dave and Fred of Joe Beef but you really need to know Vanya and Marco. Just lovely folks who really care about food, service and people. 

FOOD 
I HATE Cauliflower. Capital letters H A T E. Where is the nutritional value? It's white? It looks disgusting. It's spraypainted broccoli (another childhood repulsion but at least it has nutritional value). Vin Papillon's touch with fried chicken bits and fat drizziling over the cauliflower made me a believer. So any chef that can turn a food you hate into a food you like is the mark of a true chef. I had the pickled plate. It was nice but I think I was expecting more pickles and less of a veg medley. Maybe I was lost in translation? It's filling if you do get it. 

Rum soaked baba will make you drunk and the wine gums (with wine!) are delicious. 

Basically the menu is date friendly and it really is a great date place and of course, with lovely natural wines. 

A nicer, lighter version of Joe Beef fare. Joe Beef lite? 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Floats like a butterfly but doesn't sting like a bee. Def. in the top favourite restaurants of Montreal list."}
{"text":"Best wine bar in Montreal!  A lot of selection by the glass of unique stuff.  Somm does a great job there of changing the offerings.  

All the wines and food are written on a black board on the wall.

The food portions are small but very tasty and creative.  Very busy, highly recommended if you are in town"}
{"text":"I was in town with a bunch of friends and we really wanted to try joe beef! We had no chances of getting a reservation, esp it being july 4th weekend - there was quite a good amount of tourists in town! So based on yelp reviews we headed here!!! And i must say, it was sensational!!! 

We arrived at the restaurant and was seated about 20 minutes later. They were packed as well, but we were real lucky! The 6 of us were seated in a far corner and couldnt see much of the menu ( oh, so the menu is all written on the walls with chalk!! No handouts period...) We were all a bit skeptical at first not knowing how to proceed. The person waiting on us was quite smug and almost condescending in the beginning... Let's jus say he was snobbish about his restaurant.  But as mentioned in another review, he went on to narrate our meal for the evening. Once he got talking, he mellowed down and got more friendly. The recommendations were epic. 

The food is essentially tapas style... So u order a large variety of small quantities.. We had their take on chicken wings, mushroom and potatoes from the grill, a radish with special butter combo, some pic cauliflower from the grill, amazing red wines and some epic deserts... The amount of though put into the selection of flavors is mind boggling. Everything tasted amazing, and was their take on some traditional dish at times. 

Its a great place for date night."}
{"text":"Oh man, probably the best meal I had during a long weekend getaway in Montreal. Even the things that seemed really odd to me (big ass pieces of grated cheese on jambon with drizzled olive oil) were super delicious. REALLY great wine program too. Will definitely go back if I make it back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Months later, I still think about the meal I had at this place and salivate. Utterly delectable jerusalem artichokes, the world's best cheese plate...our server was also extremely kind, taking the time to write a list of suggestions for us out-of-towners. The ambience and decor are charming. Go!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at this resto. The first time I went I was lucky enough not to wait in line. The cauliflower and the cheese platter with the wine pairing really stuck with me. I was excited to go back and bring my boyfriend. 

This time I went on a Friday night at around 9 pm. This place does not take reservations. It's first come, first served. We had to wait thirty minutes which is exactly the time they told us we would have to wait when we walked in. We drank wine while we waited so the wait wasn't that bad. 

We got the jambon de la petite bourgogne to start. It's a simple plate of sliced ham with cheese but omg this was my favourite dish of the night!! It was amazing! 

Then we got the fried chicken. I liked it because it was not greasy and it was so juicy. It had a bit of a lemony taste to it but not strong enough to bother me. The side of brocoli and jalapeño purée was not that great because it really was a bit too lemony for my liking. 

Next we shared the the beef tartare sandwich. I was really excited to try this sandwich but I was disappointed. I love beef tartare. This one was supposed to have foie gras but I couldn't even taste it because the tartare was mixed with mustard and pickles. I really don't like mustard. It was Dijon mustard. I love pickles though so that didn't bother me. It was a bit overpowering though. I would have liked to be able to taste the actual beef tartare without the overpowering mustard and pickles. 

The roasted cauliflower was just as good as I remembered it. It was very flavourful. I liked the fried pieces of chicken all over the cauliflower. It's a staple on the menu. 

Lastly we had the cheese platter. There were twelve cheeses to choose from but I didn't know which ones to choose from so I told the waiter to choose the best three. They were all from Quebec. Two were hard cheeses and strong like cheddar and the third was soft and tasted oddly enough like bubblegum but in a good way. What blew my mind was not the cheese though. It was the bread! Omg this was the best bread I ever had. It had sesame seeds on it and was super flavourful. It comes from a bakery in the Mile end apparently. We were so full so we brought the rest of the bread home to have with our supper the next day. 

I would definitely recommend this place. The food is good and the wines are good. Although I must say that I enjoyed the wines I had more the first time I went."}
{"text":"My friend suggested this place to me. I brought one my good friends for her birthday.. the food was exceptional, down to the perfect bottle of wine and service provided. Extremely excited to go back!"}
{"text":"The Joe Beef guys have done it again!
Stellar wine and snack bar a few steps away in what is probably the most famous restaurant block in Canada.
Like other posters have mentioned, there are no reservations here, it is first-come-first served so try to make it here around five pm before everyone leaves work and you'll be fine. There is enough variety here to keep you coming back since menu options change all the time. 
Of course mainstays like cheese, pickles, nuts and bread will always be around but why not try lesser-known items like the lettuce with Bottarga (i.e shaving of salty fish eggs which the Sardinians go crazy for)? I did yesterday and it was fabulous and now I'm a convert.
Also don't skip on dessert. We tried the Paris-Brest and it was easily one of the best I've had. They got the puff pastry and cream right down to the right consistency.
The real \"star\" here of course is the variety of wines. With two giant blackboards with white and red selections, you're bound to find something you like. 

Montreal needs more wine and snack bars catering to more sophisticated palates with such reasonable prices. Between Le Vin Papillon and La Buvette Chez Simone and given how they are always, always packed and fill up within a hairs breath of time, clearly the people have spoken."}
{"text":"My group didn't know what to order. No problem. Heavenly sips and tastes were carefully chosen for us and arrived with the best service imaginable. It was most delicious!"}
{"text":"Le Vin Papillon was not my first choice. I really want to take my friend to Joe Beef but could not get a reservation. How can a restaurant that has a menu focus on seafood and vegetable satisfy my meat loving friends?!

Le Vin Papillon has no reservation policy. Best to arrive early! Arriving before 5 pm would guarantee a table if you are a small group. This is a more intimate restaurant with limited seating, especially during winter when the back patio is not available. Make sure everyone in your party here on time as you won't be seated till then!

Our friends arrived late and we ended up having a drink at the bar. I would have just have my dinner at the bar area as the bartender is super friendly and cheerful and I can just order all their regular menu. If you are a wine lover, you won't be disappointed with their wine selection.

Everything on the menu is EXCELLENT! Their waitstaff just AMAZING! We ended up doing a \"Trust your waitstaff\" style. 

The \"famous\" Cauliflower with chicken skin and the Smoked Carrot Eclair were just amazing! Vegetable dishes for the meat lovers. Duck Fat, Chicken Skin, Bacon Fat were used to add flavour to all the dish. Interesting flavour, texture and definitely not what my friend expected!

Our waiter ask if we want some more?? Of course YES!

Celery Root? I was doubtful but now I am a believer! Perfectly seasoned Beef Tartar hidden underneath some greens? Sturgeon with Squid Ink Puff Bread?

Our waiter asked if I want more? I do but sadly my friends said they were full

I have now been to all 3 chef Marc-Olivier Frappier's restaurants in Montreal. They are all consistent in service and food quality. The price point is quite affordable for what they offers. But Le Vin Papillon's offerings is just so unique and great for seafood lover like myself. Now I do have a second thought about Joe Beef being my favourite restaurant in Montreal!"}
{"text":"This charming little restaurant on the strip next to Liverpool House and Joe Beef is a breath of fresh vegetables on a street where it's historically been nearly impossible to eat anything that didn't used to have parents.

No but really. Le Vin Papillon does serve meat (and seafood of course) but offers a large variety of veggie dishes and yummy cheeses for those who aren't into eating animals, and most of these veggie options are not just incredibly original (like celery root carpaccio) but totally delicious as well.

Their wine selection is pretty good too plus they have quite a few to choose from by the glass so you won't be disappointed there.

They don't take reservations and there is usually a considerable wait at the door but it's well worth it. The food is yummy and the space is pretty (plus the lighting is muy romantic for a date).

I would suggest trying this spot out if you are a small group (2 to 4 people max) and going a little bit before you are so starving you could eat the east side of a west bound skunk. Once you get there, you might want to order a glass of wine to sip while you are standing around and maybe even try the smoked eggplant caviar app. It's easy to share and eat on your feet."}
{"text":"Le Vin Papillon was everything I wanted it to be and more.

We arrived early (5pm) and there were tons of seating options, so that is my tip for you if you want to be sure to get a table as they do not take reservations (and I cannot find a phone number for them listed anywhere!). 

The food was perfect. We had roasted carrots with burrata, which I loved not just because the cheese was somehow better than ever, but also because I think it's an insult to burrata to pair it with tomatoes and balsamic. The flavours and textures played perfectly in this dish. We tried BBQ'd clams, caesar-inspired chicken wings with anchovies, parmesan, and lemon, and a head of cauliflower with lardons that blew my mind. We even pushed through and ordered dessert, and it was worth it. Four dishes and two desserts for two very hungry girls pushed the limits of our appetites, so I would suggest bringing more people so you can try more stuff, because everything was super yummy.

But the standout was the service. Kaitlin was our sommelier/server and she was bubbly, sweet, and super knowledgeable. She guided us through their by-the-glass options (which I recommend because they have lots of incredible wines and you'll want to try more than one!) and found wines to suit both of our tastes. She was friendly and present without being too much a part of our date, and it was so appreciated. Even if the food had been just-ok, I would go back for the service.

Update: I have since been back to VP three times, and the service is still standout, and the food, impossibly, seems to be even better. Last night we were lucky enough to be looked after by Robin and Kris, and we didn't want to leave... Could have stayed there all night with the super staff!"}
{"text":"Associated with joe Beef, tapa sized plates and a diverse, deep wine list are hallmarks at vin papillon. Eight of us sat outside, arrive early if you're more than four, and just instructed the server to just bring a bit of everything. My companions are a bit adventurous with food, but don't know French cooking, and don't speak French. So they were fine to just have chefs choices as it were. 

Highlights were the raw scallops, seaweed gnocchi and baby clams. Wines are all natural wines, we enjoyed a Loire white and a red in bottles. Then a couple of us had orange wine with our desserts. 

Single diners can enjoy the bar and mingle with other guests and the bartender."}
{"text":"A new favorite! 

We had a later meal and really enjoyed trying out different dishes. Our favorite were the petoncles de l'ile verte and the duck hearts. The carot and cauliflower dishes were excessively spiced and we enjoyed them less. The sturgeon dish was more of a spread, but I really enjoyed the presentation. Overall, we had a lovely meal and I can't wait to go back and try other dishes"}
{"text":"No reservations here at Le Vin Papillon but I arrived before the dinner rush started and so I didn't have too long to wait until a single stool opened up at the bar where I had terrific service.

I let the waiter make recommendations because the big chalkboard was in French and while some things are close enough to English that I can mostly fake it, I was at a complete loss here. So maybe I got up sold to more expensive dishes. No worries, they were fab.

A great glass of French red to start with and for some reason, I was offered seafood to go with it. Okay, I rolled. An order of crab legs, which were messy but well cracked so that I mostly just had to dig out the meat. It came with a small pot of clotted cream, which probably made sense to the head chef but not to me. I enjoyed it anyway. Second dish was a sea urchin, which I'd never had before and it was quite tasty and fresh.

Not cheap, but I did have the advantage of a strong US dollar that made it reasonable.

Great service and a super restaurant. Definitely date worthy, other than you might be waiting a bit for your table. Head across the street to the Burgundy Lion for a drink while you wait!"}
{"text":"I ate here back in early March before heading back to New York. I ate a lot of great food in Montreal, but this was about as good as any meal I had there and maybe anywhere, including its big brother Joe Beef.

I had one glass of orange wine along with the amazing ham and cheese plate with brown butter and cracked pepper.  The ham is smokey and meaty, the cheese is sharp and the brown butter ties it all into a fucking amazing plate of food. I wish I could eat this every day. I followed with clams stuffed with pancetta breadcrumbs and aioli, which are beautiful and also quite delicious.  This was followed by the Ruttabaga schnitzel, topped with a poached egg and a small fillet of Mackerel. An excellent dish, I only wish I could've had a runnier poached egg or perhaps some uni as I've seen in images of other diners.

I finished with a gamay, my favorite red. Fruity, funky and very drinkable, along with a spicy lamb tartare. A nice spark and simmer to go with the rich cylinder of lamb.

Service was a lil pretentious, not as great as the amazing service we received during a decadent dinner at Joe Beef. But I was clearly a tourist, plus I live in Brooklyn so I'm not too phased by it. A must for anyone serious about food during a visit to Montreal. I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"The Joe Beef guys opened a wine bar. That was pretty much all that I needed to hear. It took just over a month after its opening but I headed down to the corner of Charlevoix and Notre-Dame (which at this point is probably my most visited street block in the city outside of the Jean Talon Market and my own apartment) with a friend for a little early weekend dinner.

The first thing you notice when you walk in is the visual differences between it and its brethren. No crazy or folksy paraphernalia on the walls. A very clean and elegant look with white brick, white tiles, wood tables and black leather. The entire right side of the narrow space is a beautiful bar where all the prep work is done. There is also a small relatively sparse terrasse in the back with communal tables. Overall, there is a sleeker look in keeping with a wine bar but once you add the blackboard menus and the alternative music, it keeps that Joe Beef/Liverpool House feel that I love.

Like its brethren, Le Vin Papillon has no set menu on paper. When you enter, there is one blackboard with the day's menu listed as well as a couple that list the wine choices they have by the bottle. Surprisingly enough for a wine bar concept, they don't have very many selections by the glass. It is almost all by the bottle. The wines were mostly French and Italian from my browsing of the choices. The wines I tried were selected by our waiter because, to be honest, I have a complete lack of knowledge of wine outside of California so I figured he would be in a better place to provide me a good glass. Both were quite good but I won't go into details here. I'll stick to the food. 

The menu is very interesting in that it is very light on meats which is really separates it from both other restaurants. The dishes are mainly vegetables based and are very much dishes design to accompany wine and share amongst your dining party.

First up, we went with the haricots-coco-romano. Local quebec green beans with some prosciutto, sun-dried tomatoes, romano cheese and beans tossed in some olive oil. As will be a pretty consistent theme through the meal, this plate was a great showcase of local produce with a few augments to enhance and up the flavours. The sun-dried tomatoes and the romano were nice pairings with the crisp green beans. The olive oil allowed all the ingredients to blend nicely.

We followed that up with a selection of their cheeses of the day. Again, we left the choices up to the staff with the caveat of no blue cheese (still not a favorite of mine by itself). We got 3 out of the 7 they were offering that day. Great selection by the staff as they mixed up the texture and the tastes nicely. With the cheese, we got a plate of toasted artisan loaf bread with butter as well as fresh nuts to crack and enjoy. Loved the bread - thank god they didn't leave a basket at the table during the whole meal because I wouldn't have stopped eating it. As from the nuts, I love the idea but the practice of cracking them at the table is a little messier than is ideal. 

Next up, we went with the roasted onion and ricotta cheese. Just a great dish and a kind of item pairing that in hindsight I wished I had thought up sooner. Fresh creamy ricotta cheese with a beautifully roasted sweet onion and some more of that bread. Absolutely no complaints here.

The final dish of our first selection was the chicken wings with tarragon. Nice flavours here and the wings were cooked as they should be, however I feel this was the least successful dish but only because of the impractically of eating wings at a wine bar. A little too messy and sticky to enjoy with a glass of wine even when trying to eat them neatly.   

Still somewhat hungry, we decided to order a couple of more plats. First up this time, their rotisserie Cauliflower. Yeah, that's right. This dish was by far the most unique thing we had this evening. Roasted cauliflower with thyme, crispy chicken skin, candied lemon peels and a spicy oil mixture on top. A surprisingly spicy dish but one with great texture and crunch from the roasted cauliflower and the chicken skin. Very enjoyable.

We then went with our waiter's suggestion of the vinegar eggplant. Roasted eggplants topped with a tomato/almond mixture, some melted cheese, some fresh basil and of course, as the name implies, vinegar. Nice earthy flavours throughout with the sweetness of the tomatoes, the richness of the cheese and the acidity of the vinegar mixed in. A surprisingly filling dish on top of all that. Very well done.

To finish the whole thing off, I went with a homemade chocolate truffle with some fresh blueberries. Rich creamy chocolate interior coated with some crushed pistachios for a little nutty crunch. Perfectly done and the perfect sweet touch to cap off the meal.

Overall, a very nicely executed wine bar concept and one with a menu that surprises with its emphasis on vegetables. A few dishes and some wine glasses later, you leave stuffed and quite satisfied."}
