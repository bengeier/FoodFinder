I came here in my first year at uni, but that was a blur as I had too much fun that night and blacked out. I just remembered that the pork bone soup was so good that a bunch of us almost started a food fight :P. 

So I guess this would be my first official visit haha. After a long night of intensive exam prep, we decided to have some comfort food at Ktown. Someone suggested to come to Mom's Korean Food because they had a craving for for the pork hock (12.95) which was a portion big enough for three of us. It was deboned, sliced, and tender, and we were gleeful at the amounts of collagen it contained which promotes youthful looking skin. There was some pickled tiny shrimps on the side to dip the pork in for flavour. Be sure to only dab a bit because the shrimps are very salty.   /5

For the main dish we had the Korean army stew hotpot(~10/person) kind of like the Dak Galbi without the cheese and chicken. Ours had green bok choi, sausage, luncheon meat, instant noodles, mushrooms, rice cake, kimchi, and tofu in a spicy soup, boiling to perfection. We got rice to go with it, and it was so good! The soup went along with the rice quite nicely, and once the pot was boiling, the ingredients were really well soaked in the flavour of the soup. /5

SIDE DISHES: pickled cucumber and radish helps with fighting off the spiciness of the food. Also good with soju. 

Atmosphere: 
Very cozy, just like the name of the restaurant. It wasn't very loud at 9pm, so that was good. 

Price:
Decent price, you get a good deal for what you pay for. 

They also had combos where you can choose a dish and add on either one bottle of soju or 4 bottles of beer. I had that the second official time I went, which was:

05/17/2016:

and we chose the pork hock with soju. Not a big fan of soju but then we got beer and mixed that together xD so good with the pork hock! 

Overall: a perfect place to have some late night snacks and drinks with friends, or a casual dinner date! I would be down to having food and drinks here with a potential s/o. (Not side order lol)."}
{"text":"Food is ok, worst service ever. After I told the waitress my order. 20 mins later. She told me pork bone soup is out. How can it take that long to tell a customer something is out. No matter they are busy or not. You will get the waitress' attention."}
{"text":"I was hungry last night around 4am. My choices were either Pho in Chinatown, Commisso Italian on Caledonia, Raps Jerk Chicken, or Hot dog vendor on Bloor. I live in the neighbourhood and was feeling some dirty Korean food. I saw great reviews about MOM's, usually I hit Night Owl, which I another 24hr joint, just up the street from MOM. The food experience was good. I ordered sizzling squid, stir fry pork with steam rice and fried egg, and a miso tofu pork soup for take out. The first two items was tasty, above average. The soup was little to heavy in saltiness and I didn't enjoy it, but it wasn't bad. Over all I give it a 3 star because the tasty was good, the quality was good, and the service was friendly. I tip the waitress 5 bucks and she was surprisingly happy and thankful. However, I want to be honest and say that the meat portion on the rice dish and the soup was ridiculously cheap as in portion. The rice dish, there were like 5 prosciutto thin slices of pork, I can't even say slices because I was not. They were like thumb nail sizes, same goes for the soup. Honestly, they should be more generous with this. The price was super cheap, the cooking was done right with care, and the portion were bit small. But than again, the prices are ridiculously cheap.  In my opinion, they should increase the portion, especially the meat part and than increase the prices up to standard prices. Last thing, the sizzling squid was tasty, fresh, and portion was fair for 10.95. I'll go back again, and I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went today around 7:30pm. Had a good experience with their lunch special in the past. Today we ordered jotbal, budaejigae, and bulgogi. Total cam to $53 after tax. The jotbal was terrible, it was the quality of what you get at a supermarket. The bulgogi was $12 but portion was so small and quality was not good. The budaejigae was okay because you cannot go wrong with that. The service was very bad. I asked for tea 2 times and still had to wait to be served. I was very thirsty. The 2 male servers were not even that busy. They did not even ask if we need anything or check up on us. Very dissapointed and do not recommended this place other than their lunch special. I guess if you go late night when you are intoxicated then it is ok."}
{"text":"Good food, very well priced. No fancy decor inside - just well made dishes and friendly service. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service is fine, food is not so fine. 

Lady Tremaine's working in the kitchen I think"}
{"text":"I lived in Korea for two years and I lived off of Korean food from small hole in the wall diners. If anyone has been to Seoul, you can find Kimbab Chonguk, a Korean diner chain. This is the closest thing that I've found to it! The atmosphere, decor, and best of all PRICE, are just like what I experienced in Seoul. The food was amazing; I had kimchi jjigae with a plethora of sides. It tasted just like Korea :D

However, Korean food newcomers be warned, this place does match the Korean atmosphere that you'd find in Seoul. Your waiter will most likely NOT ask to see how you are doing, refill water, or bring you additional sides. This is not because they do not care about you, it's simply because that's how it's done in Korea. YOU MUST ASK for refills and/or additional items. Some may say \"Oh, well they're in Canada and they should change accordingly\". If you want the overbearing restaurant service that you're used to, go down the road and pay twice as much your Korean meal.

The only downside is that soju Korean vodka, is ridiculously expensive T_T

Anyway, if you're looking for some truly authentic (and inexpensive) Korean fare, check this place out!"}
{"text":"First time went there in winter they gave me cold tea, asked if I could get hot tea they told me it was being made.  So I ordered the lunch combo to eat first but the quality was average at best.  Btw they didn't give me any side dishes (most other places would give).  After I finished it the hot tea was still not ready I wasn't sure if was actually being prepared.  I wasn't happy at all and wanted to get outta there but the server there was focusing on the smartphone and not looking at the customers.  I almost had to walk upfront to get the bill as I ran out of patience."}
{"text":"Beer here is 3.50 a bottle-- fairly priced. Great outdoor patio for the summertime and for groups up to 8 people-- rare for that strip of Bloor st. 
Complimentary rice bowls for $1.50-- a quick fill-me-up. 
Open late!"}
{"text":"Tried noodles, fried rice, gimbap and they are okay but their side dishes are not so good."}
{"text":"Literally the worst Korean food I had ever had, I ordered the cold noodle with the least spiciness but I ended up couldn't finish the noodle as it was So So Spicy. The chef clearly didn't read my comment. 

We waited for thirty minutes after ordering the food, then I asked the waiter why it took so long for our dishes to be served, it turned out that he forgot to log our order into the system. NO APOLOGY WAS GIVEN!! 

Would not come back, such a disappointing dining experience. The worst part is there were flies fly all over the restaurant."}
{"text":"Walked into this restaurant because i didn't want to deal with a crowded one, which was the best choice i made that  day.  

simple decor But amazing food.  Tried their pork bone soup on a cold winter day and i was filled and warm. the taste is just right. i have also tried the dukbokki multiply times and have not been disappointed yet.  The jajangmyeon is amazing ( i am biased toward jajangmyeon ). and also tried many other dishes from their menu and all off them were delicious 

so basically you can'y go wrong with any order, the are well cooked and flavored, i feel like they know what they are doing and it is done properly.

The service was also as good as their food, very friendly people and i felt totally comofortable. 

The price is very reasonable, was actually shocked at first. (The food is way too good for the price )

I almost forgot to add that you can also order to go, (Take away)"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place in Korean town.  Tried pork bone soup and stir fried spicy pork.  Pork bone soup is one of the better one I've had, spicy level is strong enough as some places tend to be on the mild side.  Stir fried pork is just ok but other items look good as well.  I wish they serve more sides but I guess it's reflected on the price.  Price point is one of the decent one in this area.  Lunch special is well worth it, 7 bucks including tax, can't ask more than that.  Service is good comparing to other Korean restaurants.  Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"On A Sunday AM, feeling dragged out after a night out. Ordered Soon Tofu Soup (Mixed). It was comforting and tasty and the sides were really good as well. Soup included 1 dumpling, 1 mussel, 1 large shrimp and an abundance of silken tofu. This was not as good as some of the other stews I've had on Bloor St. over the years but definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place after a concert and ordered a bowl of their spicy tofu soup and boy, was it delicious?! Definitely recommend this spot to everyone who wants to try some good Korean food!"}
{"text":"This used to be Kachi Korean Restaurant, the first time I went to this place was more than 10 years ago when it was still Kachi.  I went there again yesterday because my brother said they serve decent pork bone soup.  It was just a quick lunch so I didn't bother looking up reviews or anything.


Not too bad, soup base was great, meat was tender.  Two recipes for great pork bone soup...  side dishes were decent, wish they gave 6 instead of 4 side dishes.

There is a parking lot at the back street, easily accessible.

No complaint so far for pork bone soup."}
{"text":"I've been low key avoiding this place after my first visit last Spring resulted in noodles with barely any beef but I was looking for Korean on Friday night, it was something I was familiar with, and Yummy had a line. So I decided to give it another shot.

It was alright - I got bibimbap with beef (not much of it) and he got sweet and sour chicken. I find it a little odd that the chicken is $13 - without rice. Also it had an incredibly odd texture. The side dishes are cute though - cucumber, spicy potato, bean sprouts, and the traditional kimchi.

That said... I'm going to keep avoiding this place. The atmosphere is a bit sterile, the police had to be called for a belligerent customer, and I wasn't impressed by the speed of service - And after reading Jack's recent review about food poisoning, I'm going to consider myself lucky."}
{"text":"I've only visited this restaurant twice and after my most recent visit, I can clearly state that it will be my last time.

I ordered the beef glass noodle pad thai that took a fair amount to come out and when it did I was essentially just dining on a lump of noodles and little else, as the beef was non-existent.
This wouldn't be that much of an issue for the cheap price and I clearly wouldn't bother to take the time to write a negative review purely based on a lack of beef in my dish, I am only writing this and giving Mom's Korean food one star for the fact that within a few hours of leaving and getting ready to go to sleep, I noticed a gradual pain in my stomach that continued throughout the whole night and got to the point where I woke up from a constant pain that at points were fairly agonising, which then finally lead to me vomiting it all back out. 

In a nutshell, just avoid this place and get Korean food elsewhere. I can't imagine the sheer lack of hygiene in this establishment if I was able to get food poisoning just that quickly"}
{"text":"This place is alright. Definitely don't come in a rush. Ive been here twice and both times the wait was longer than usual, but there are more dishes than other standard home cooking restaurants. There's some cheaper single-person dishes and some bigger portioned hot pot ones. Unfortunately previous commenters are kind of right about the abundance of onions over other ingredients and there's less meat than you'd hope for. However it is cheap but what you get for price isn't exactly there in speed . It's definitely very mom and pop and rather short staffed (just one teenage guy running the food out to the whole place) and they have the standard appetizers"}
{"text":"I got their pork bone soup and stirfry beef with rice. I absolutely loved the pork bone soup and when I compare it to Owl of Minerva it is the best soup that I have ever had. The meat slides off very easily and the broth is full of different flavours. The broth was not too spicy but for some it can be spicy. The beef stirfry with rice was really good as well however I wish they had given more meat as I was left with a shit load of rice. The two employees were very nice and our order came in very quick. I would definitely come back here again; it was very cheap. It was so good that I forgot to take pictures."}
{"text":"I ordered the ginseng chicken which was recommended by their main cook. It was one of the more pricier items on the menu, but given that I have never tried it before, I thought I'd give it a shot.

The broth was extremely tasty and the chicken was very tender. It was literally an entire mini chicken in the broth. 

Service was good. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Spicy kimchi tofu soup is great. Banchan also good. Service is quick and friendly; the people who work here are very nice. Gimbap was below average when we visited."}
{"text":"Considering the not-so-good experience I had at a restaurant nearby in Koreatown, I was skeptical that this one would be any better.  The decor of Mom's Korean Food is nothing fancy and the menu looked pretty much the same as all the other Korean restaurants nearby.  However, they proved me wrong.  Never judge a restaurant by its looks, because they have, hands down, the best Korean food I've ever tried.  That isn't saying that much seeing as I've only been to a couple in my life, but next time I'm in the mood for Korean, I'm definitely coming back to this one.  

FOOD:
We shared the fried pork dumplings as an appetizer, and they were delicious!  And when dipped in the spicy sauce, they were even better.  As a main, I had the spicy sizzling chicken, which came on a sizzling hot plate.  Beware when picking your level of spiciness though, because I picked the mild (the least spicy possibly) and it was still very spicy! I also got to try my boyfriend's dish, which was the pork bone soup, and it was definitely very tasty.  And as always, our plates came with the usual Korea sides (the best was definitely the pickled spiced radish!)

SERVICE: 
The service is why this review got knocked down a star.  They were definitely nice but I think they kind of forgot about our table half way through our meal.  It took a while for them to come back and check on us, so we had to wave them down for the bill.  We were seated on the patio though (which is nicer than the inside of the restaurant, by the way), so maybe that's why we were a bit forgotten- out of sight, out of mind kind of thing... 

Overall, it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"I will make it short: place and kitchen are relatively clean despite cafeteria like decor; not appealing. However food is tasty and the flavors are well balanced. Price is really good for the quality. The fried seafood rice cake is 6 bucks (tax included) for lunch and it is not too salty or strong. My partner had the tuna spicy soup and that was amazing; strong ginger flavor works!
Service is quick and minimum (sufficient) you can see the kitchen and the prep area from the cash register. As I mentioned, clean. It also has a few outdoor seating a too."}
{"text":"Korean Village had a lineup, but it wasn't full.  Weird.  My wife was desperate and wanted to eat NOW.  So, we came here.

I had a rice bowl and she had a chicken noodle soup.  For the price & expectations, this is a solid performer.  If I were in similar circumstances, I wouldn't be upset about coming back.  Their other stuff looked good too."}
{"text":"Good korean food. It was pretty delicious! None of the places in korea town are really about ambiance but if you're looking for good selection, this is a good place."}
{"text":"My non korean friends say that Mom's offers the best Korean food in Ktown and it's true. I'm not Korean but I'm a professional food critic and instagram foodie and I know what good Korean food tastes like. Also perfect place for a first date cause my date looooooooooooved the place!!!!! thanks mom's!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The name of this place seems to imply comforting and tasty home cooking, and as it turns out, you wouldn't be wrong in making that assumption. The food is indeed good, and does taste like home cooking. 

We can vouch for the sizzling squid, the pork bone soup, and the seafood pancake, which we were extremely satisfied with. The pork bone soup was particularly memorable, with its tender pork and subtly flavored broth. To top it off, service was friendly and fast. 

This is the food i'd want my mom to make if she were Korean. It's not quite as cheap as it would be with Mom (as in zero $), but the price is right, too, and won't break anybody's budget."}
{"text":"Ordered pork curry with rice and there were barely any pork. There were 5 mini pieces smaller than a cent. I asked for it to have more, i would get charged, then i asked for it to be switched, they would not let me. I asked for a refund, and they would not let me as well. The server ignored me for a long period of time when i had my hand up even though she saw me. This is the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant. I was in shock of how bad it is."}
{"text":"Good food. Good price.  A pleasant surprise. It was busy but we didn't wait for long. Service was quick and efficient but nothing to boast about."}
{"text":"I was in need for some comfort food, so I came here to dine alone at 11pm. There's not many places you can come alone to grab a late night meal without feeling like you're a loser - I think so at least.


I ordered the pork bone soup ($6-7), and the bulgogi beef \"sushi\" roll ($5-6). As always, I ordered too much for myself. The pork bone soup alone was enough to have me stuffed.

I've had pork bone soups from other Korean restaurants and none has been as good as this one. Lots of flavor but not salty or overwhelming. Just the right amount of veggies, pork, and potatoes. I felt like the soup wasn't as oily as other places and I didn't feel like there's a film of oil in my mouth or throat.

The bulgogi beef roll was great. Nicely wrapped, beef not overly flavored, rice on point, and the pickled radish done right! I had two pieces and took the rest home because I was already stuffed from the soup.

They bring you complimentary appitizers - kimchi, radish kimchi, pickled cucumbers and a sweet potato. I got two rounds of the potato. They most likely give you a second round as a complimentary and may have to pay for the additional orders like other places.

I want to give credit to the Momma cooks there! I came in and two female chefs were managing the kitchen. It's very rare to see but I love seeing women work the kitchen in this predominantly male industry. I guess that's why they call it \"Mom's kitchen\"? :P A male chef came in later on in the night to take over one of the chefs.

Service was great! They weren't overwhelming and constantly coming to check to see if you were okay or asking how the food was - I think we can agree that this gets annoying after a while. They were very attentive, kind and welcoming.

The decor of the restaurant isn't anything special but it's very clean for the most part compared to many other Asian restaurants along Bloor, or even in comparison to many small restaurants in the GTA. It's very brightly lit with some Korean \"idol\" shows on the TV.

I recommend this place! I love that it's 24/7, and chill setting that's welcoming for us lone diners! :)"}
{"text":"I'd really give it a 3.5. Service was really good and the restaurant has some space in it as tables aren't too squished together. 

I ordered the seafood stew meant to be shared by 2 people and subbed the rice out for ramen instead. It was cloudy day outside with a bit of wind so this dish was the perfect choice for comfort. 
The first things that came out were some of the classic Korean side dishes. The kimchi was quite good and spicy if that's your kind of flavour. The other side dishes were alright, but didn't seem like they had much complexity to them (unlike other places that have different marinades for each little dish). 
The seafood soup had a nice spicy flavour but not overly spicy so you can easily eat a good amount of it without burning your tongue. There was also a nice mixture and amount of seafood. The portion size was not bad. I was satisfied, not stuffed. The dish tasted very good with the ramen as a sub."}
{"text":"It is all about the food here. Decor....not happening but if you want delicious food in a timely and friendly manner this is the place. It's always full of diners so you get the idea that people come back. It's in the heart of Korea town with a million other dining choices but I love the larger dining area, service and straight up good eats!"}
{"text":"pretty good, got the soybean tofu soup and finished all of it except the pork. wish there were veg soup options."}
{"text":"This is the worst Korean food that I've ever had. I ordered goat soup n I asked for a not spicy broth. It turned out a RED pot of mild spicy broth. That's not what pisses me off. It's the goat soup with little to NO GOAT in a goat soup. I picked all the goat stripes out of the soup n there's like only 6 stripes of meat... like there won't be anything left after ur first bite... I asked the waiter is this actually a veggie soup? Coz all I see is veggie. Where's the freaking goat? Mom's freakin Korean Food? This restaurant totally cheated on me. It costed me $12. It's not even a cheap price. I can get pork soup with actual huge porks that makes me full in OWL which only cost $9 by the way. Mom's Korean Food sucks. Don't go."}
{"text":"I came to this place for a quick meal and while it wasn't the best, it seems like a great place for comfort food.  

Service: 2/5.  It's not really a restaurant, but a place where they will give you your food and leave you alone after eating your food.  

Price/value: 3.5/5 - Plates are quite cheap and you can get your meal for around $10 plus some banchan.  

Food: 3/5. I had some kimchi fried rice. It had a decent amount of kimchi flavour and was a fair sized plate.  It wasn't \"wow\", but more of a \"cool, I needed that\".  Not too spicy either so if you like it hot, then it may not to be your liking.  If you want fried rice, then it's good.  

Verdict: Nothing spectacular, a bit ordinary but still a decent place if you are hungry."}
{"text":"I went there specifically for the ginseng chicken soup and it did not disappoint.  The broth came out piping hot, flavorful and not salty.  The soup used a young whole chicken and it was tender.  The soup was pricy at $17 plus tax but it was delicious.  There were three servers on that Friday night and all the tables were filled but the service was attentive and I had my side dishes filled twice.  I would go back there again."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Korean food I've ever had! As soon as the Banchan (side dishes) arrived at our table, first thing that came to mind was \"WTF?!?\", as they literally served us 2 radish cubes and like 5 slices of mini cucumber for our table of 5! 

We ordered the following dishes:

Seafood Pancake
- it was not crispy at all, thick, doughy and mushy

Hot Stone Beef Soup 
- it came out warm, not boiling and did not look appetizing, the beef and soup was bland

Black Bean Sauce Noodle 
- the sauce had a really bitter after taste and it did not taste like any Korean black bean noodle I've ever had...it was gross

Chicken Mixed Rice 
- it was cold

Stir Fried Squid with Rice
- it lacked the stir fried flavour

Ramen Rice Cake
-it was ok

NEVER again!!!"}
{"text":"The First time I have been there was terrible. Definitely will not go there ever again. Since I had class at 11 so we find the only restaurant open that early, we order A shrimp fried rice which has no shrimp and very little amount of rice. We called the waiter to make sure whether he order the right one for us since we didn't see any shrimps. He said it was shrimp fried rice even though it has no shrimps. The soup and pork we ordered were also scanty, worse experience."}
{"text":"Too small portion sizes after waiting 35+ minutes for our food. Did not give us menu's, table too small to fit our dishes, did not provide utensils, had to ask over & over again for things. Food was not that good to make it worth the wait, they were not even busy! Not returning."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when I walked in because this place was really busy and looked like a great authentic Korean place. But when I got their food, I wasn't a big fan of their jja jang myun. And the food was pretty pricey for their relatively small portions. The bulgogi was good, but it wan't enough for $10. From my experience, there are better Korean restaurants in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"It was a rainy sunday afternoon and all of the korean restaurants were either closed or full. We decided to come here since it was the only place that wasn't full (it actually only had 1 other customer lol) and we were desperate. We ordered a beef and octopus hotpot for $20 and shared it amongst 5 people (even though it's usually only for 2 people).

I have to say it was pretty bad. There was barely any beef in the hot pot(which was honestly the only thing we wanted to eat anyways). The soup was way too spicy and lacked flavour... it was like drinking spicy water. The octopus was just plain bad (way too chewy and had a weird taste). There were some vegetables in the hotpot too but it wasn't anything special. 

I was really let down by this place and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food, had the spicy rice cakes (Tteokbokki) and potato pancake. It was enough for five people and very filling. Very affordable and home-y atmosphere, definitely reccomend!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever!!!' If I can rate negative stars I would do that! The restaurant advertise that their lunch is 9$ including tax, but they are lying! The food tastes sooooo bad. The service is horribly rude!!!!! 

For the food:
We ordered the kimchi soup with pork, black bean noodles and sizzling chicken.
You can hardly see any pork in the Kimchi soup. The taste is average. The portion is small. 
The black bean noodle tastes bland and not authentic. 
The portion is so small for sizzling chicken(14$) compared to a typical Korean restaurant! And imagine one third of the the dish is onion and another third of the dish is pepper... and a few pieces of chicken, you call it a sizzling chicken?? Not to mention that taste is below average... 
there are only 4 side dishes and they all taste bad. 
But consider the price is cheap... my friend and I are not that upset until they brought the bill.
The black bean noodle and the kimchi soup are both from the lunch special which they advertised to be $9 each with tax included! Yea, they had this advertisement both in front of their store and in store. However, when the bill came, they still charged us for taxes for those two dishes as well as the other one. So we ask the waitress. The waitress couldn't explain anything but asked for another waiter to come. They are talking in Korean. After the talk, the waiter said this is correct, which is not! So we ask them to explain why they charged us extra tax. And the waiter is very impatient, couldn't explain nothing but saying you should pay this price. My friend and I were very upset by then. And the waiter said he will bring the calculator. And after he did a few times, it still turns out that he charged us more. And he's attitude is very bad and give up trying because they did wrong and they refused to explain and change it!!! And worst of all, the waiter said some swear words in Korean!!!! And my friend said we know you are talking shit. And the waiter said just pay the price and smashed the chair towards our table!!! How rude!!!!!!!
I encourage all of you guys never come to this restaurant again!! If you walk a few meters you can find another restaurant called yummy with authentic Korean food with wayyy bigger portions and cheap rices and great tastes! Even the side dishes comes in six and all tastes great! 
This is the worst dinning experience ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Pork bone soup was great and hit the spot... Prices were fair.
Service was very friendly... Looking forward to coming back... :)"}
{"text":"There's been a self resurgence of my love affair with the original Korean town as of late. After many years of neglect on my part and really settling for (north) Korea town I have almost forgotten about this place where it all began. Jokes aside, I am beginning to rediscover and rekindle that feeling of when I first fell in love with this food. There's a nostalgic and homey feeling about most the restaurants here. Unlike the newer/more hip cousin up north in this part of town you see your dishes meticulously made with care by what appears to be a self taught, home cook. The stuff here is not flashy nor fusion. Neither do these joints pump out the latest R&B singles with dimly lit and cozy atmosphere. These fine establishments only know of one way and that is to create great food sans the frills.

Mom's is another fine example of a good Korean grub joint. Late night eats, cheap and delicious dinners, affordable lunches -- this is it. There are dozens of examples of this type of place within a block of this area but nonetheless they do deserve the credit for staying true to their mission. Fantastic tasting Korean food at an affordable price! Only drawback is the lackluster and uninspiring free appetizers."}
{"text":"Tried Mom's for the lunch special: $6 (tax included) got me the most flavorful kimchi jiggae I have ever had in Koreatown...and I've eaten a lot of jiggae! Not too salty, loads of kimchi, and a fresh ginger flavour that put the bowl over the top. Comes in either pork or tuna, but i had the tuna. Served molten hot and super fast by our friendly server. My partner's spicy rice cakes were also very tasty: glossy sauce and perfect chewiness. We received 4 banchan which the server refilled after asking us if we wanted more. Kitchen is partly open and looked very clean and well organized. Lots of fresh cold water. All in all a great deal and we left very full of delicious food - we will be back to try the beer combos one of these nights!"}
{"text":"I was not happy with the food, either the quality, or the quantity. The BBQ meat was severed in a medium plate, semi-cold and not much flavoured. The Tufo meal I ordered was supposed to come with chicken, but there was barely any chicken there. The staff were slow with no facial expressions. Two starts are just for its low prices."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant, the food is good, service is ok. They take order and serve very fast. But disappear after that.

I will probably come back, but for the same price, you have better places in the same area."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday at noon and the service was a bit lacking, with only one person trying to do everything at the front. However, the pork bone stew was BOMB. So satisfying. Pork had lots of meat and not just bone. One of the best pork bone soup I've had compared to other places on the street."}
{"text":"Not actually open 24/7. Tried to come here for breakfast... Like 8:30am.... And no service"}
{"text":"Today me and a friend stopped by this restaurant since the menu items were dirt cheap. We came in and was immediately greeted by the waiter once seated we got the menus, they had lunch specials for $6 plus tax and the alcohol combos for $14-$16 plus tax too. My friend whipped out his camera to record some stuff for his travel blog (he's only visiting), the waiter like immediately came over and began questioning us but she didn't tell us if it was not allowed in the restaurant but I guess they're kinda weary because it's family-owned and I guess they're worried we might steal the recipe or something idk. Otherwise it was a good experience overall. Banchan was mediocre, 3 types of kimchi that sadly, I'm still burping up lol and a simply tossed pasta salad. We both ordered royal rice cake but he ordered a kimchi pancake while I ordered a potato pancake. The royal rice cake was really good, thankfully not too salty (had a bad experience last time I was here), potato pancake was also mediocre so I ate it with the regular kimchi to balance out the blandness of the pancake to the spicy and vinegary taste of kimchi. We paid separate bills and it totaled to $13.90 per person which isn't so bad. Definitely going back again for the really friendly service minus the questioning LOL"}
{"text":"4am service was rough. After a long wait for water and menus, the first server to pay us attention warned us that the food would take 20 minutes..... ugh.

The banchan (small dishes) were pathetic: a marginal kim chi that looked like the last bit of cabbage on earth, sad looking pickled cucumber, and some beans.

Mains were borderline.

Owl of Minerva would have been a couple notches higher"}
{"text":"The best Korean food I had in Toronto. I ordered kimchi rice balls and rice cake&ramen with vegetables."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try this out and we had very high hopes because the other restaurants that we've been to, we usually have pretty good experience. Anyways we ordered the beef and octopus hotpot (20$) which is normally eaten by 2 people but we shared it amongst 5 people. We all weren't that hungry but we shared he hotpot pretty equally so that was probably the one plus.  when we started eating there was barely any beef and the beef did not taste flavourful right away so wait until eating the beef because the flavours will not be there, the octopus was fine but one of my friends found it a bit chewy. The hotpot had noodles,mushrooms, and a whole bunch of onions. The broth and the rice tasted good together after we let it simmer a bit more. The service was normal, and the food came fast. The food was good but it didn't satisfy me the way I thought it would. By the end of our meal we were all pretty full but most likely will not be eating here again. If you are ever in Koreatown don't make this the first place u decide to eat at."}
{"text":"Went for lunch at 10:50 am and called ahead to ask if there was a kimchi and pork lunch special? I was greeted on the phone with a \"uh.....hello\". Very unprofessional.  He proceeded to say \"...uh we don't have?!\""}
{"text":"This place offers great prices.  I usually come here for their lunch special from 11:00am to 3:00pm or post midnight since they're open late.  I usually get their pork bone soup - it is always consistent as the meat slides off easily and tasty soup base.  I always get extra spicy (it actually tastes sweet spicy).  I think this is the only place in Korea town that allows you to have noodle or rice cake in the soup, instead of the typical rice on the side.  Whenever, I don't feel \"carby\" I come to Mom's to get the rice cake option. 
 
The stir fried glass noodles with beef and assorted vegetables.  This tasted okay, there was not a lot of beef.  I personally prefer the pork vine soup more

I would actually rate this restaurant 3.5/5."}
{"text":"Came in right before 2pm, so there weren't too many customers, a very friendly waitress (also the only waitress working) greeted us.

They currently have a lunch special for $9 (tax included) for about 6-8 items. We also looked at their regular menu, and comparing to their \"regular prices\" to their competitors, they were on the more pricier side. But my friend and I opted for the lunch specials. My friend got the glass noodles (normal sized portion) and I ordered pork bone soup with rice cakes (instead of just rice). 

The rice cakes in the pork bone soup was a pleasant surprise. I liked it much better than just plain rice 

Overall, I thought the god tasted good and the prices (due to lunch specials only) was decent and the place was spacious and clean. 

I'd give it 3.5 stars

Would I go back? Hard to say because there's seriously waaaay too many competitors serving up similar dishes with lower prices. But it's not a bad place if it's right in front of you and you don't know where to eat"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. 
A lot of different options on the menu. I got the ramen rice cakes, pork bone soup and kimbap. All the items on the menu were under 10$, which is decent. 

They served 4 side dishes (kimchi, bean sprouts, cucumbers and radish). The food was pretty good with good spice and flavor. Service was fairly quick but friendly. 

I would definitely come back to try different dishes. You can also order takeout here too.

Oh and this place is open 24 hours :D"}
{"text":"This place was good, and bonus, they were open to 1AM!!! (AC is not very strong though). 

Their menu is quite extensive with lots of options! They also serve small Korean side dishes, which is always nice to see! 

I ordered the black bean sauce noodles, which were okay. The noodles were hot and not overdone when they came to the table and there was lots of sauce. Overall, it all taste pretty good! 

My friend ordered the hot stone beef soup. It was super hot when it arrived and he seemed to really enjoy it. It comes with a side of white rice and has glass noddles in it. 

Turnover is very quick here!"}
{"text":"We weren't expecting much when we went out on Christmas Eve looking for a place that was open.  Mom's Korean exceeded our expectation by leaps and bounds.  The food is tasty.  There are always little delicious sides that they serve for free like Kimchi.  Their prices make them very affordable.      

We now frequent this place after hockey, a night out or sometimes just because we are craving it."}
{"text":"Second time here, and the food quality is great. Best thing about this joint is that it's 24hrs! The food here is just like the food in Korea! If you want great Korean food late at night and you're around Bloor and Bathurst, then come here!"}
{"text":"It was last Friday after a night of drinking that I had this ridiculous craving for Korean food. Since I was already downtown, I figured my friends and I might as well go to ktown for food. After parking, Mom's Korean food was the first restaurant we saw, judging by the appearance I suggested to walk down a little further to see what other restaurants were open, quite fortunately it was cold and we ended up settling for Mom's Korean Food. Boy, it was a fantastic choice we made. As we walked in, we were immediately seated. Quickly put in our order and it was a matter of minutes until our food was already out! We ordered the spicy pork bulgogi with rice, pork ribs, ramen rice cake, fried beef dumplings, seafood soon tofu soup and Jjamppong. We didn't have high expectations for the food, but I must admit the food was delicious! The bulgogi was cooked very nicely, it wasn't too chewy or too hard. The pork ribs were seasoned with a hotpepper paste and when I ate it, it literally came off the bone, it was made to perfection. The ramen rice cake was mediocre, in my opinion I don't think it was big enough and it was a little dry for my liking. I didn't try the beef dumplings, but my friends were raging about how tasty it was. How I usually decide whether or not I like a Korean restaurant is by judging their soon tofu soup, and I have to say, it was impeccable. It had the right amount of tofu, that the tofu wasn't overpowering the soup, the spiciness of the soup was good but expect a little kick, the broth was quite memorable in my opinion kind of had chicken broth base so I quite enjoyed that. For the final dish, Jjamppong, for those of you who aren't familiar with Korean food, it's a spicy based noodle soup (soup flavor similar to soon tofu soup btw) with seafood, usually shrimp, muscle and squid. I have had jjamppong 4 times, and this is by far the tastiest one I've had. The noodles reminded me of a skinnier version of udon, the soup was a little spicier than I expected but it didn't stop me from finishing my bowl! Overall, I had a good experience here and I'm sure I'll be coming back soon for my next Korean food fix!"}
{"text":"Cheap Korean food but you get what you pay for. It's quite popular but I'm not sure why."}
{"text":"It's a little bit expensive and the portions are not big. But I understand it's in a prime Korean downtown location and the rent is not cheap. The quality of the food I'd give 4 stars. And the service from the staff are decent. The only problem is that their English is not so good so it's hard to communicate. Other than that, this place is average."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the PRICES here, but not 100% on the food.

$7 lunch specials are awesome! And $7 seafood pancake!?! I really miss the great prices for korean food, because it is unheard of in Vancouver and entirely non-existent. 

However, the food we ordered was just okay in my opinion. I ordered the Kimchi Chigae with tuna, he got the pork bone soup, and we shared the seafood pancake. The side dishes were okay, not above average in taste and choosing. 

What bothered me the most was that the Kimchi Chigae with tuna option had almost no tuna in it. I pointed this out to the waiter but he said it's always that much. I was thoroughly disapointed because I remember going to Owl down the street when I was in Uni few years ago and they would LEGIT put almost a full can of tuna in it. 

My bf said the pork bone soup was just okay BUT it had sooo much meat in it. I feel that is definitely a plus and why people come here for that alone. The seafood pancake had nice big chunks of seafood but it wasn't crispy at all and a bit soggy and thin.

Overall, decent but not the best Korean food on Bloor St W. Glad I tried it though!"}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken do-ri soup and it was basically water and 3 pieces of chicken. It was not good. We didn't find too many korean people there, and I think it is because the food isn't too korean. Was very disappointed and sad to see my $30 taken away."}
{"text":"Not bad for the price.  I had the sizzling chicken with rice.  Decent sized portion and was fresh."}
{"text":"Wanting a late-night meal after work, we figured Korean would be the best bet to get good hearty food late. We randomly just chose this restaurant because we were looking for gamjatang and bibimbap. It was 10pm and only 2 other tables, service was SLOW. Being Korean, I've been to my share of Korean restaurants uptown and downtown and Korean food doesn't take that long to cook, so I was disappointed. Prices look standard for these two meals. Restaurant looks old, not very clean, but kitchen is open to the public, which I like to see. The service seems to be manned by the owners' two kids, so this may be why it's slow. 
We ordered GamJaTang and beef Bibimbap. The GamJaTang was alright, portion was above-average and the broth was a bit salty. The pork was cooked alright. Personally, if you want good GamJaTang, go to Owl of Minerva. Next, the Bibimbap didn't have the right proportions of veggie & meat to rice, but I liked the kochujang sauce they made that came with it. Usually restaurants make it too spicy but they made it just right. Too much rice, not enough meat and veggies but I was hungry, so a somewhat satisfying meal. 

I don't know if I'd come back. I'd go for other Korean restaurants before this one."}
{"text":"Sizzling chicken is good I finished the whole bowl of rice (I haven't done that in a very long time) 

I feel like i'd be much happier if they have more side dishes cuz you know the korean side dishes are bomb"}
{"text":"a pretty great place for late-night eats (since they're 24/7!) 

they don't give an overwhelming number of sides or any other freebies in particular, but they're nice and their food is 4/5 so I would definitely come here during super late hours."}
{"text":"Price is okay. Nice food when you want something light. I like their bean sprout soup."}
{"text":"This has become my go-to place for Korean food. I simply love this ma & pa restaurant (I really believe it is ma & pa in the kitchen with the kids working the front of the house.) I love that this place offer hearty home-style Korean cuisine. And I love that the kitchen is open. My favorite dish is the staple Kam Ja Tang (Korean pork bone soup), and the bulgogi is also good. Their fondus seem like a popular dishes, although I haven't tried them yet."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a good price. I love the hotpot here, plein of food with veggie, beef, octopus. The soup was good, very tasty. Banchan here is free, u can refill more. The lunch menu very cheap, if someone needs a good lunch, come here!!  
Next time i want try other food here."}
{"text":"Relatively cheap but extensive menu. I went here during lunch with a friend. This was also where I got to try dukbokki for the first time and it was not bad at all. I also got the black bean noodles, pretty enjoyable. The wait for it was also not that long"}
{"text":"Food over priced with little content... Not taste at all.. my bulgogi rice has more veggie than beef.. nor flavourful at all...Side dish taste bad as well... I say I would pay $7 for this dish... Such a disappointment.... Yummy next door is soon much better... Please Don't come!!!U will feel the same !"}
{"text":"Other than the fact that the quality of their side dishes has gone down over time, everything else about this place is really great :D"}
{"text":"The food is so amazing, this soondubu was extremely delicious and so was the kimbap. It's good food at an amazing price. Spent under $20 for 2 people. Highly recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"average quality compared to other korean places, didn't have to wait long. appetizers were few and sparse looking, just a few veggie slices, not the good ones I am used to from elsewhere (potato, beansprouts, jap chae, beans, fish cake pieces even). husband said his portion left him still hungry so I left him a part of mine. had better, had worse! prices are okay I guess. also, they accept debit cards so you don't have to carry around cash. not enough reasons to return here sadly, maybe if other places were full or closed."}
{"text":"The area use to have a lot Korean food choices. Most look run down like dirty Chinese food on Spadina. THIS place however is kinda run down  but clean. Ordered Spicey Chicken with rice it tasted like the kimchi the served so I did not like too much but the since I could just ordered more kimchi. But the chicken was cooked well with a fried egg on top was a good mix. Good portion  not too small or big and watching the K POP on the monitor was entertaining!"}
{"text":"To all our US friends.  They don't take credit cards and want you to use their ATM.  They will \"allow\" you to use your debit card.  If you want to use US currency, they'll do it 1 to 1 exchange and give you Canadian change.  

The nang myun came out of a bag.  I saw the  chef pour it out it out of a pouch.  The Jia Jang myun was pretty good except that the cucumber was sliced like a caveman.  

Being Korean, I expected a lot from ktown Toronto.  Instead we were disappointed with a dying area.  If you want Korean food, find it throughout Toronto."}
{"text":"Got the stir fried kimchi with pork and tofu, which is $15.99 before tax and tip. Got a very soupy mess that consisted mostly of kimchi and onion, with maybe several small slices of pork belly and four tiny wedges of tofu. The place is cute and the servers were nice, but there weren't enough hands for how busy the place was and so service was pretty lacklustre. My boyfriend ordered the bibimbap with tofu, which was alright but definitely wasn't worth the $14.99 price tag. Seems like a fun place to come drink and maybe share a hot pot, but I wouldn't recommend anything else."}
{"text":"Mom's has mighty delicious pork bone soup. I wasn't that hungry when I arrived, but I managed to finish the whole bowl down to gnawing all the excess meat off the bones!  The boyf didn't love his sizzling beef, but I thought it was good for the price. We agreed, though, that the amuse-bouche/nibbles/whatever they are called were totally yums, especially the one with jalapenos (radish maybe??)! All-in-all, a great spot for a cheap lunch: our entire bill for two came out to about $20 with tax & tip. And since the staff were eating next to us when we were paying the bill, I left really feeling like I'd eating in Mom's Kitchen."}
