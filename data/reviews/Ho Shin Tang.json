{"text":"Nice staff!
Good service and make me feel eating at home!
Order tofu seafood soup, stone rice and  seafood pancake. Both of them were fresh and tasty! 
Price was reasonable! Price for lunch will reduce about $2 each!"}
{"text":"Very bad service I got to say.  I believe the lady that served me was the owner.  She should of know how to have better attitude towards her customers."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Place looked ok from the outside but when you enter it looks totally different. Service was not friendly nor professional. Lunch came with 2 poor side dishes that were not fresh.  Pork bone soup was lacking pork bone. Bibimbap was ok. Wouldn't not recommend."}
{"text":"Had high expectations since the reviews were good..but they fell short in my opinion.

We ordered jap chae and bibimbap to go. They were flavourful but expensive and portions were small compared to other places that offer take-out as well.

Also, they did not provide side dishes (eg. kimchi, soup) like the other places I have frequented.

Will probably not go back since there are other options."}
{"text":"The first time we went the food came in small portions but everything tasted good especially their Kimchi. We thought we finally found a good Korean restaurant close to home.
Then we went again this weekend. The food was even in smaller portions, tasted nothing like Korean food, and every dish including the rice was stone cold. We told the waitress that the food was very cold and she was like, ok, fine, I will just throw them back in the microwave for a few more seconds.... 
Also the owner was even too cheap to turn the heat on. All the customers had their winter coat on while eating, which was ridiculous. We should've left when we saw that lol
Anyways, will never come back again."}
{"text":"First time here, order pork bone soup, bibimbap and pork rice soup, they all came out great! Recommend to try port feet meat if you like a bit fatty portion, tasty and yummy."}
{"text":"I used to eat here once a week when they opened up a few years back, since it's close to where I live...  

Setting - they really pump the air conditioner in there so it's cold. My wife usually complains about how cold it gets. But I guess wants you eat some of that hot --- tang it warms you right up? So there is a method to their madness. Overall place has average decor, and clean! which is important.

Food - 

Gamjatang is average at best, compared to Owl of Minerva at FMP it definitely lacks a bit of character.  

Spicy black goat soup - they are known for this, according to the owner.  I've never had black goat soup before but it's pretty damn good. But be prepared to burn a hole in your underwear later...

Bulgogi - A++ for this. Definitely one of the better bulgogi dishes out there.

Bibimbap - can't go wrong here. Their gochujang is bar none when you add it to the stone bowl rice!  It has a hint of alcohol. I always thought about stealing the damn bottle so I can add it to my food at home.

Sometimes if you're lucky the will have kimbap at the cash register, and you can try some.  It's off the menu stuff, but when eaten fresh it's the best damn kimbap I've ever had... Definitely better than the ones you buy at H-MART or one I could hope to make myself.

I recommend it since I have a soft spot and been going in since they first opened. However I can see where some patrons are left disappointed.  But there's always improvement even if you're already good at what you're doing!"}
{"text":"My second worst restaurant in town.
Ordered a grilled pork belly and Busan pork soup. 
Waited 20mins+ before getting my side dishes/starters. 
Pork belly is mostly burned and tasted bitter. Remember this is $19.95 for two but there is no rice or free soup! Me and my girl feel thats not enough so we ordered a Busan pork soup. Well basically it is plain pork with no taste and raw chinese chive in the soup. Can only have it with provided source or no taste at all. Don't like it either. Would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp .... clean and nice atmosphere. Restroom is clean too. Food is good and staff is very nice and friendly. Price is reasonable. Will be back again!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely exceptional. This is my first time here, but it definitely won't be the last. 

The food is extremely clean and delicious. They were also able to cook a custom dish  for us, and they didn't even charge us anything extra.

The owner is also really friendly and is very passionate about her food. 

Definitely recommended if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing it's better than all those Korean restaurants on Yonge and finch"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this Korean restaurant.  The waitresses can speak both Korean and Mandarin.

There are 6 or 7 different banchan including kimchi and namul (Korean seasoned vegetable dishes) that you can refill if you want more.  

Gamjatang Jungol (Pork Bone Stew) is not too spicy (can adjust it when ordered) and there are 3 big Pork Bone with lots of meat.  Mix the soup with the white rice is so yummy. 

Dolsot Bibimbap - always like the Bibimbap in the hot stone bowl.  The server stirred it for us.  With the right quantity of hot sauce, it entices your appetite

Ginseng Chicken soup has a strong smell of chicken.  For that night, the ginseng smell is light and overtaken by the chicken, though it is still a very good soup.

The seafood fried pancake is out of our expectation and is the lowest rated dish for the night. It does not have the seafood smell and feel when you are eating it.

Kalbi is average and not anything special.

Overall the Gamjatang and Ginseng Chicken soup are the best !"}
{"text":"As a Korean, I've never tried a Busan restaurant in Toronto, so I was really excited to try Ho Shin Tang out as per my friend's recommendations. I ordered the Soondae Guk (sausage stew), and for some reason it tasted... off. I'm fully aware of what traditional Soondae Guk should taste like, but for some odd reason, it tasted kind of old. On top of that, all my soondaes had essentially exploded, and I was basically having what appeared to be ground beef stew. Never in my life have I had Soondae Guk of this astonishing quality. I might give this restaurant a second chance, but for now... I'm still pretty scarred. On the bright side, their kimchi and other banchan is bomb and I loved it."}
{"text":"Finally, tried this place on my quest to find the best PBS in or near the Toronto area. Honestly, it was a 3.5 on my PBS scale. The soup was missing something to take it over the top. It does have potential though. The feeling I got while eating at this place was very homely and chill. Service was attentive. The lady also did mention to me that if we wanted more side dishes just ask, which I thought was nice of her. 

Still on the quest though.. I'll keep u guys updated! Any yelpers out there think they found a good place for PBS? Pls msg me!

Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. I ordered food before another table and the other tables got their food first. I had to wait at least 40 mins. Service is so bad that people had to get off their seats to wave the waitress down. 

Side dishes are crap. 

Portions are ridiculous. Check my pics. 

Food doesn't taste good. 

Not a single redeeming quality about this restaurant. Serves stale rice, literally two scoops of soup and charges 13$. 
Yelpers beware. Do not come here. There are much better Korean restaurants to go to and this is not one of them. 

Parking sucks in this plaza too. 
Don't waste your hard earned money here."}
{"text":"Man, what a find! This is definitely a restaurant I never noticed was here, but definitely a good one! A hidden gem if you will.

My dad was the one who recommended it, however he didn't even know what it was called. Very friendly atmosphere upon entering and got seated right away. A very relaxed and modern design inside, and a good use of a smaller and narrow space. 

A good sized menu that boasts a couple specialties. We decided to go for the Beef Ribs and Pork Soup w/ Rice set meal and the Boiled Pork Slices and Soup W/ Rice. 
The side dishes that came with were quite themselves. Their kimchi was definitely the best, and was definitely made in house. They even gave you the whole lettuce to cut up yourself! 
The Ribs were done really well, on a hot plate and extremely flavourful with onions as well. The soup was rich and spicy, just the way I like it. 
The Boiled Pork Slices were so fresh and light, didn't even feel like I was eating fatty pork! It came with lettuce and sauce as well, which gave it a very traditional Korean eating experience. 

Service was very friendly, but a little on the slower side. They were constantly busy, so it was hard to get a hold of someone when you needed it. Other than that, the owner was super friendly and came by to see how we were enjoying everything!

Definitely worth coming again as there are many things I wanna try here! Until next time!"}
{"text":"Three of us went last weekend to try it out.  We ordered dolsot bibimbap (mixed rice in stone bowl), chicken kampoongi (spicy and sweet battered chicken) and jajangmyun/jamppong mixed bowl (noodle with black bean sauce and noodle in spicy broth with seafood).   Banchan/side dishes were very fresh.  We received kimchi, kkakdugi (radish kimchi), bean sprout salad, Chinese green and lily bud salad.  The only place I've ever been to, in and around Toronto that has dried lily buds salad as side dish!  
I can't personally speak for the bibimbap but my friend was very happy with it. The chicken dish was great: light batter with real pieces of chicken.  (I know some places coat gobs of batter on tiny pieces of meat/gristle...)  Although we are used to saucier version, this restaurant had it more dry but was still very tasty.  And the most exciting part, I finally have a great jajangmyun restaurant in my neighborhood!  Perfect texture noodles, nice chewiness, and sauce was not too greasy.  We'll definitely be back to try out all the different soups!"}
{"text":"The pork feet is amazing! Large portion for 3-4people. Each slice is thin and has skin fat and meat. Always have the meat with side vegs, garlics, kimchi, and lettuce all together. And it's very quick no need to wait, about 2-3 mins and it's done."}
{"text":"Best seafood pancakes you will ever have.   I have to say, when the owner is not around, service is a bit off.  It's a family business and that's what happen when you hire your in laws.  Food is amazing."}
{"text":"This has been the worst Korean food experience since living there. I like to try the gamja tang at most places since it is my favourite Korean soup. 

It was bland. Colourless. Flavourless. And the meat was tough. 
The side dishes were lack luster too. Only 2 sides and poor quality kimchi. 

The group I was with were not impressed with their choices too. Except for the bibimbap. 

The service was less than par as well. Tea was spilt all over someone at our table by the server. She didn't seem very apologetic. And didn't offer anything to make things right. It was very unprofessional as someone who has done that way back as a server. 

Definitely will not return and the quality of food was not good either. It hurts me to say that I had such a bad experience with a Korean restaurant run by Korean people."}
{"text":"I have become something of a regular at Ho Shin Tang, their execution and consistency is what keeps me coming back. 

I have tried a vast array of Korean staples at this place and the only thing I found disappointing was the soon tofu (it was pretty bland, definitely far from the best I've had). However everything else I've ever tried here has been pretty delicious. They make a good kamjatang (pork bone soup), but my personal favourite here is the Kimchi-chi gae which comes loaded with kimchi, pork, tofu and clear noodles. Be careful when asking for your soup/dish spicy, I did this with my kimchi-chi gae and they loaded it with red chillies, it was delicious but also slightly painful (and I'm no slouch when it comes to handling my spice). The banchan here is consistently good and always made with care (they give you about 4-5 varieties), don't be shy to ask for more banchan as they are always happy to refill these side dishes. 

The place itself is super clean, fairly modern in décor, the service is better than most Korean places, and the wait staff is always happy and courteous. Our food always comes out fast, even if the place is busy. I will continue to return to Ho Shin Tang and would definitely recommend it for your next Korean craving."}
{"text":"All these years, I've only eaten here late at night when the parking lot is half empty and this restaurant has a table or two within it.  Attended by one mid-aged Korean woman, surrounded by cute little pig toys (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/ho-shin-tang-richmond-hill?select=F2EXuKln0EB7-CfgfUmPGw) and K-pop or Variety shows on television.  I would order...

 A1. Busan Pork and Rice Soup ???????  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/ho-shin-tang-richmond-hill?select=AUi8DoIajgNfuUfEmHRPNA

Mix a bit of the accompanying sauces (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/ho-shin-tang-richmond-hill?select=2ZbXAX1kmzilDR1Vn7CuzA) in the soup to taste. Apparently there's a eating process, but I'm Chinese and hungry at night so my method is to bring spoonful of rice into the soup instead of mixing the whole bowl in which keeps a bit more rice texture than turning it into porridge.

I haven't offended anyone yet with that eating style, but then even when I eat there's probably another 2-3 tables of Korean customers that come in this late and just shy of restaurant closing.  In fact I don't remember seeing any Chinese customers during my visits, which is rare in Richmond Hill and in this plaza

Pay by credit card, go up to the counter and you'll see the beer/soju fridge and from time to time you may see a bottle or two of local craft beer which I found interesting.  My theory is that it's for the chef, either that or no one orders it and it's been in there for a long time so do not order."}
{"text":"Huh???!!?! I didn't rate this place?? Say whaaaa? This is undeniably one of the bomb-est place in r-hilly for some great authentic and health-concious korean food. Seriously, the owner used to be a body builder (her pic is on the wall, dark tan and all), so the food is made with extreme consideration on health, oil usage and definitely zero traces of MSG. 

The menu is a bit small, but they're extremely good at what they specialize in - the pork busan soup. Every person I've taken here has fallen in love with how authentic, delicious and hearty it tastes. It comes with these boiled pork slices, which is a crowd favourite. I always get the soon tofu without the seafood and egg and it's flavoured with just the right amount of everything. With rice, I'm all carbed up and ready to go. They give you loads of kimchi, in this little cute pot. & Their banchan changes every day because it's never the same, each time I've been here.

The parking lot is ridiculous and apparently nobody knows how to use a one way? There are always so many hondas and toyotas that just get stuck, like a deer in headlights. Lord, help me.

I'll still return to ho shin tang though.

Ps. I love how you can write on the wall - so cute! Try to find me and my yelp sig ;)"}
{"text":"I like this place. The atmosphere is nice and quiet and their food is pretty good. Their pork bone soup isn't as good as Owl's but then again, not many places can compare to them. I'd recommend this place to people who want to have a good and peaceful meal"}
{"text":"Second time here.  Located in a strip plaza on Hwy 7 between Leslie and Bayview, the parking can be a little crazy at lunch hour though they have a few additional spots out back - just come early and you'll be okay.  The decor is modern and tasteful, the prices are quite good (though not quite First Markham Place prices, but then again it's sit-down not quick-serve), and the food is decent.

Paid $7.95 for the gamjatang which came with steamed rice and the usual assortment of side dishes.  The soup was decent but lacking spice a bit.  Overall, not bad, though not blown away.  I'll come back to give it another go.  Probably the best affordable Korean place in this immediate area, but if you want better, get your butt to First Markham Place's food court down at 7/Woodbine.

ps.  The owners have recently changed the sign to red (was yellow before) so watch for that since the current photos attached to the Yelp posting show the old yellow sign."}
{"text":"I got the bimbimbap. Although service was quite friendly, I thought the bimbimbap was missing something, some \"umph\" in its flavour profile. I've tasted better bimbimbap elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food was delicious must try the bibimbop. Service was outstanding. The servers came by multiple times to see what else they could bring. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's a bad sign when the restaurant across the parking lot has people waiting and this one is empty. I should've taken the hint. 
(The place across the parking lot happens to have terrible service also.)
Ordered pork bone soup and tofu soup. Both were not good. Pork was tough, the soup had no taste, I was eating orange hot water with rice. Not impressed. The tofu soup had the flavor of chili oil, but beyond that no other flavors. 
The service was good, waitress had no other table so it was easy to get her attention when we needed her. 
The food was just bland here. Won't be returning, should've taken the advice of the other yelpers."}
{"text":"I have been craving for Gamjatang and decided to try this place. It's quite new but I read a lot if good reviews. Servers were friendly and attentive, they refill the banchan and tea without the need to ask for it. I ordered the Gamjatang, pork bone soup in spicy potato soup. I like mine spicy and requested it from the server. She replied that I can adjust the heat on my own, so I expected them to serve it with chili sauce on the side, but it never happened. The soup was ok, meat was fall off the bone tender, but I've had a richer more flavorful Gamjatang at Owl of M. I also tried the shrimp fried rice and it came with black bean sauce which was so good. I would be back as I am pleased that this place is clean compared to other Korean establishments, but I would order something else next time."}
{"text":"We have been going here for a couple of years and find our experience has been inconsistent. The first time we came, we enjoyed everything we loved the large pieces of kimchi that you cut at your table and LA kalbi and hotpot we ordered was very good. Then the following time we came the food was not as good but we decided to still come back and to our surprise we had a better experience again. So we continued coming here. We find the menu keeps changing which is nice but on our last visit we thought the prices that they charged for their dishes was unreasonable. The food was good for the most part but not the best and the portions were small. Also this time the kimchi was tasteless. Also they only gave us 3 banchan. We ordered the kimchi stew and it was a tiny bowl which you would expect as a complimentary size and it was $11.95. Then we got the seafood pancake which was $18.95 and nothing special. The most disappointing dish was the deep fried chicken in hot pepper sauce. It comes in 2 sizes and we got the small size for the 2 of us and it was a size for 1 person and the cost was $16.95. Don't think we will back until we see better reviews."}
{"text":"So as mentioned in my previous review I visited Ho Shin Tang again last night! This time I ordered two other dishes that were different than my first. The first dish I ordered was the Seafood Doenjjang Jjigae (soybean paste stew). It had thick pieces of tofu with an assortment of seafood topped with green onions and hot pepper flakes. The broth was flavorful and sweet due to the seafood. I would say this dish has a very homie feel to it. It's served with a bowl of rice like all of the stews they serve. The second dish I ordered was called Kunmandu (pan fried dumplings) this is very similar to the Chinese pot stickers except the dumpling skin was a lot thinner than the conventional dumplings and a lot crispier. It was served with a dipping sauce which I thought complemented the dumplings. Of course I also ordered my favorite stew, the Seafood Sundubu Jjigae (tofu soup). This time I had requested for a spicier version. This will always be my favorite, perfect for a cold winter day to warm your tummy with :) 

I am not sure if I was just extra hungry or the food was just THAT good.. My girlfriend and I shared a total of four dishes and completely polished it all off! Check out my pics if you don't believe me :p"}
{"text":"Have to agree with Jennifer K. - the pork bone soup was a lot less spicy and flavour was a bit lacking compared to other Korean restaurants. Still a very good soup though. Huge portions of meat but almost to the point that I could not finish it. At $9.99 its a bit higher in price when you can find lunch specials for the same quality at $6.99.

Also got the soon tofu with Yellow tail for $15.99. The fish itself was quiety large and grilled very nicely which made the skin of the fish very crispy. 

Side dishes included sweet and sour radish, kimchi, bean sprouts, peanuts and a pickled veggie. Not my most favourite side dishes. 

The service was excellent. Waitress asked twice if we wanted extra side dishes."}
{"text":"Finally, a decent Korean restaurant close to home!

Looking at the menu, nothing jumped out from the typical line of Korean food for me. Since I was craving for some meat, I had ordered the gamjatang (pork bone soup), and my cousin ordered the jajangmyeon (blackbean noodles) + jamppong (spicy seafood noodle). 

The banchan (side dishes) were red kimchi, bean sprouts, chives kimchi, katugi (radish kimchi), salad with thousand island dressing and seasoned spinach. The spinach and salad was a little bitter to my taste but the red kimchi served made up for it. I was a little disappointed in the taste, which was quite bland and bitter, and the lack of variety. (I might be biased since I love fish cakes and soybeans the most for sidedishes...) 

The waitress was friendly as she served our food, reminding me to be careful of the hot stew bowl. The pork bone soup was massive in size, nearly 4 large pieces and some potato, in which I was grateful for since I was hungry. The soup was flavourful, for the lack of a better word, and the meat was soft and juicy. However, it was missing a spiciness level to it. The owner explained to me that their soup is boiled for 24 hours, and the recipe is from the countryside of Korea. It is supposed to be not spicy but she said she could modify it with notice next time. Nevertheless, I was still impressed with the richness of it! 

The owner also added that the noodle in the jajangmyeon and jampong was hand-made. We jumped to taste it, and indeed, the noodle was extremely chewy. There was plenty of seafood, including mussels, squid and shrimps, in the jampong and the spiciness level was perfect to my cousin's taste. All in all, we were very impressed with the noodles. 

The service was friendly, and the owner was extremely helpful in catering to our needs. The overall price range was typical for a Korean restaurant. I noticed that they had a lunch menu, for weekends only, and it is a good deal! 

Would I go back? Definitely. The flavour is there and the price is right!"}
{"text":"I came here twice in the summer of 2014 when I worked in Markham. 

Food: I got the pork bone soup (gamjatang) both times and I liked it a lot!

Service: Service always very fast and the staff are so friendly and nice!

Parking: Pretty tight parking as there are a lot of stores and the lot is pretty small. It's especially hard during lunch time but we still managed."}
{"text":"Love this place! We always come back for delicious gangjatang - pork bone soup, bibimbap, even jajangmyung and sweet and sour pork! Service is great and food always come with a table full of side dishes, depending on the season you get different dishes. One of the most decent Korean restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"It used to be a good and solid Korean restaurant in Richmond Hill, but I am not sure if it has been under new management. It has a new cool and trendy decor since my last visit; It just tastes different now. 

The most recent visit was not very good experience. The service was slow even though the restaurant was half empty. 

The food was very blend - from the banchan to main dish. I am not sure if the chef was into very healthy cooking - no salt but I could not taste the natural taste of ingredients either! 

The L.A. Kalbi portion was very small and it costs a lot more than other Korean places. 

Most likely I will not return."}
{"text":"Food: 2 stars
Ordered: pork bone soup
Two large pieces of pork bone with 1-2 pieces of potatoes. Soup was more bland and barely spicy compared to most Korean restaurants. Meat wasn't fall-off-the-bone...actually wasn't very tender at all, but not tough. Pretty mediocre overall. Their side dishes were even less impressive. We were given kimchi, bean sprouts, and potatoes in a sweet sauce? The sauce didn't really taste like much so I can't even remember if it was sweet or not. I did notice on their menu that they're specialized in a pork and rice broth? I may return to try it next time if I'm in the area but after their pork bone soup, I must say I'm a little discouraged to come back.

Ambiance: 3 stars
Cute wall of scribbles and sketches! Didn't read too much into what the scribbles were but it looked nicer than some generic wallpaper. Standard tables and chairs. No booths. 

Service: 3 stars
Only 1 waitress was working on a Friday night. It wasn't very busy and we got our food pretty quickly. There really wasn't much service throughout the meal but not really a big issue. The waitress was friendly enough so no complaints =)"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our pork bone soup and spicy sliced pork on rice.  Portions are generous and the service was attentive. Soup arrived piping hot and meat had good flavour and not completely over cooked.  Spicy pork had a nice spicy kick without being overpowering and the red and green peppers were sweet and balanced the dish out well.  Pork sliced were well cooked and remained juicy.

Lady told us that the restaurant does not use MSG and uses traditional home recipes.  

I'm a fan and will return to try other dishes.  4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Ho Shin Tang means Good Soup according to my friendly waitress! 

*Cute waitress alert for my Yelp Friend! 

Their Gamjatang (Pork Bone Soup) is suppose to slimmer for over 24 hour and is their signature dish.

Gamjatang ($7.99) here is a lot less spicy and the flavour is a lot more subtle than other Korean restaurants. Just a hint of spiciness by red pepper powder and definitely lack the punch. The soup was not served as hot as I would like and the pork bones were lukewarm.

Bulgogi Jungol ($9.99) has so much sliced beef that would have make any meat eater happy. The taste of beef was strong and so was the sweet soy sauce was quite intense! One of the better bulgogi jungol I experienced.

Waitress gave us free refill of banchen and even asked if I need more soup for my Gamjatang! 

Ho Shin Tang is open from 6 AM serving Korean Breakfast! Morning Special for $6.99!"}
{"text":"Less than i expected, gamjatang is really below average.
They gave very small side dishes, plus the kimchi were too sour.
Service is good though, but obviously the waitress had no idea of how to split the bill.
Not recommend it at all"}
