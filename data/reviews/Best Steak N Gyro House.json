{"text":"This place is da bomb.  It has money food, huge portions, and last time I went they had Crazy Taxi.  That was a few years ago.  Unfortunatley I missed a visit on my last trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"It is what it is. Cheap food, big portions. Doesn't deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"Steak and G's is probably the grimiest spot you'll ever step foot into.  I am certain I would have been mugged by now if there weren't cops in here 24/7.  With that said, this place is an institution.   The grease in the fryer probably hasn't been changed since the turn of the century (the 20th, not 21st) and they have hands down the best gyro in the country.  

If I ever launch a sitcom pilot it will be loosely based upon the characters I have interacted with at 2 am in this place while eating an infamous \"Gyro Box\""}
{"text":"Steak and G's, as it's affectionately known to us natives, is a veritable melting pot of people of all races, economic status, ages, and levels of recreational drug usage. The magic of this place is that it can unite these disparate groups under the banner of good, greasy, late-night eats. 

What should you expect when you walk in? Clearly, something that used to be a 1970s lounge. But today the once-soft light has been replaced with the harsh, unforgiving glow of the fluorescent bulb, illuminating the zombie-like gazes of hungry patrons anxiously awaiting their midnight meals. You'll spot the regulars -- the Unabomber lookalike in the corner scrawling mathematical formulas on his napkin while he pounds black coffee, the guy in the suit who may or may not be a friendly neighborhood pimp, and the obligatory gang of stoned high-schoolers playing nonsensical games with the hot sauce bottles on their table. Like I said -- a true cross-section of America. 

Back in my day (c. 2000), the food was prepared and served by a couple of amiable gentlemen of Greek descent, who I believe were the owners at the time. I heard they've since sold it. You will undoubtedly find a Flintstone-size log of meat rotating on its spit, a huge griddle good for scrambling up anything from pastrami to eggs to hash browns, and an arsenal of fryers just itching to whip up delicious French fries and mozzarella sticks. 

The must have items on the menu: an authentic Greek gyro, a corned beef sandwich with cheese and pickles and a side of fries, and the cheese sticks themselves. The later you go, the better it tastes. 

So here's to Steak And G's: trophy of the dives, titan of fried cuisine, the crown jewel of Shaker Heights restaurants. God Bless America, Amen."}
