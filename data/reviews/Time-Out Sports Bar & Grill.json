{"text":"Great food, great people, and cold beer. What more can you ask for. Best wings in town. You'll swear your in buffalo."}
{"text":"I love time out it is super fun and my best friend pricilla is the best bartender in Vegas"}
{"text":"I don't always have hot wings, but when i do, It's at Time out!   Best Bar food in Town!!"}
{"text":"Love this bar! We are from the other side of the mountain and would go every night if it was closer. Huge and newly remodeled place. Machines are great. Only came here because of Joe, couldn't know a better guy who takes GREAT care of his customers. Hard to get customer service in vegas anymore. So this definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Looking forward to watching d games here. Just tried d wings n thought I was in Buffalo. Good job guys. I'll definitely b back!"}
{"text":"Ok, first the full disclosure.   My son's band plays here on occasion (HaleAmanO) but this review will be exactly my opinion of this establishment.   The staff is very good at making you feel welcome.  My wife and I have been here a number of times and the owner has made many improvements.   They have a kitchen on premises and the burgers are good, and some Hawaiian style dishes are offered as well.  Nothing special here, but the food is plentiful and tasty.  Bar prices are decent, great bucket specials when the bands play here.  They have made improvements by installing new lighting and sound for the stage, and they also turn off the TV monitors over the stage during performances.   They got rid of the couches, on the dance floor (another big plus)   The cover charge usually includes the first drink so actually it's a good deal when you go there to listen to live music.  Priscilla is a wonderful bartendress, always upbeat and mixes her drinks well.  4 star for now because there is always room for improvement.   Nice people, and good vibes."}
{"text":"I went to this bar on Saturday night and sat at a table with some friends. They ordered food before I arrived and it came to the table 30 minutes later. It was typical bar food, decent but nothing special. We were there for 3 hours and the only server I ever saw was the one who delivered the food.  Never had a cocktail waitress at our table, I guess they don't realize they could make more money if they actually offered to sell drinks. When we left the half eaten food from hours before was still sitting there, no one ever came to bus the table. The cigarette smoke was awful. Music was good, but I doubt I'll go back. Best thing I can say is the restroom was clean."}
{"text":"Went there for Open Mic Night.  Let's start elsewhere though. The place was smoky, and smelly, with a dirty bathroom.  I came in carrying my gear, and sat down. Twenty minutes passed, and no one came and asked if I would like to order something.  I finally went to the bar, and ordered a drink.  Now the Open Mic.  Strictly amateur hour.  Musicians/singers who had very little ability to perform, and comics who were not funny.  The audience was unresponsive, and on may occasions, they were yelling at the top of there respective voices while the performers were trying their best to entertain.  If you have any true performing ability, whatever it may be, do not waste your time going to this venue.  They will not only not appreciate your talent, they will be resentful of it."}
{"text":"Love this bar... I'm always feeling welcome... Food is great... Bartenders are awesome, even though I don't drink alcohol it makes no difference to them, we all get treated equally..."}
{"text":"By far the rudest male bartender I have had unfortunate experience to meet. He ignored me and other patrons that were not \"his friends\". He was overly arrogant and just made me feel unwelcome. I think his name was Phil, but as he never introduced himself I can not be sure. I will never go back to find out either!   Other than that it was a bit smokey, but the patrons seemed nice and welcoming. I spoke with a few that agreed about that was the way the bartender was, so I just finished my drink and left."}
{"text":"I go for the karaoke and they always have it rockin ,food is great,drinks are decently priced a place to party away from the strip I love it."}
{"text":"Best bar I've been to in town! The patrons are friendly and the bartender is excellent. There's plenty of room to move and ample seating. Oh, and the best hot wings in town hands down!!! Great place!"}
{"text":"Get the chicken wings, and tell them that you want them \" Wet and Well\" that means crispy and saucy.... this place will do it for you, and say Hi to Priscilla, she's the cute one!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Bartenders are nice and very active with guests. Great place to hang out before class. It's right down the street from CSNs W. Charleston campus. Happy hour starts at 0200 and ends 1800!"}
{"text":"The epitome of a dive bar! Not necessarily in a bad way, but only giving out two stars from my experience earlier this week. For starters, it was totally dead but took the one lone lady bartender a good five minutes to notice I'd walked in- because she was so engrossed in conversation with a patron. I guess it could be worse.  There's a large sunken seating area for watching games, and this bar has DirecTV- a plus in some ways, but considering that's what I have at home, this isn't a place to go to watch a game that's on the NBA or NFL package, they don't have that here from what the bartender told me.  They do have a food menu, and a Yelp check in offer saying you get a free drink with a food purchase- but the menu looked a little overpriced for bar food and I did not choose to try it at this time. Lots of built-in poker machines built into the counter, most of the TVs are a little bit of an older style, signs up said they have karaoke on Thursdays but when I went it was completely dead- maybe I need to come back for those wings everyone's talking about.  Not sure when happy hour is- think I sign said their late one was 2AM to 5AM, but there's another one that ended at 5PM or 6PM. With normal pricing, our two small draft beers (Blue Moon and Shiner) were $8."}
{"text":"Far and away my favorite bar in Vegas. The Bartenders are always friendly and the food is always on point."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan.  The food is awesome (best mozzarella sticks in town), the bartenders are friendly (Priscilla,Tiffany, Nita), and the drink prices are more than reasonable.  During karaoke they have $12 bottomless beer or $15 wells.  A good sized stage (for a bar) and a huge seating area.  I've seen some great live music there as well as comedy shows (Rise To Offend podcast).  They also have pool tables, darts, a punching bag game, and beer pong.  There's plenty to do in this bar, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visited Time Out for the first time last week after hearing about their great burgers. Erica our bartender was very nice and attentive. Although the food took a bit longer than we like to wait, everything was great and two of the owners (Fred and Joe?)  came over to welcome us and thank us for visiting their place. My girlfriend and I will be back as soon as Time Out  gets their video poker games(next month?)because we like the people and the burgers were great. WE WILL BE BACK SEE YOU AGAIN SOON"}
{"text":"Stopped into this little gem today to have a bite and a drink.  Marney, the bartender, was GREAT!  She was friendly and got us everything we needed.  The food was good and the drinks were cold . Could not have asked for more!  We will certainly return!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect dive bar for just that purpose...to hang out in a dive bar.  A group of friends and I came for the karaoke and had a blast.  It's a Buffalo Bills centric bar, so I have to assume they would probably have some sort of football deals going on during the games, but for just a regular karaoke night amongst a group of friends, the drinks were reasonably priced, the service was amazing and I can't complain about the atmosphere.  I'd definitely go back again with my group of friends."}
{"text":"just came during Sema.   awsome place.  beer cold food good presilla  was best waitress ever.   this is our spot from now on when we come back.   must try the wings"}
{"text":"Bar is very smokey, but typical local bar. Drinks are cheap and stiff. They have karaoke nights as well. The DJ was great and played every song that was requested. Nice chill bar. There were lots of people ordering food, great bar food prices too."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this little dive bar. The service was awesome and the BBQ was delicious. I'd highly recommend the baby back ribs with the north Caroline BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Nice bar, great prices it has a diamond table and a bar table , good music. Not good for large crowds but it's cozy."}
{"text":"Great food.Good drinks and a great atmosphere. There is a happy hour and the bartenders are very friendly night or day.Lots of different things always going on from Poker, Karoke,Live, Music, Football and Comedy.The food prices are very affordable as well as the drinks. SOME GO AND HAVE SOME FUN.They do have many tv for all the sports games."}
{"text":"First time here at Time-Out Sports Bar and Grill! Having a great time. Phil and Priscilla are fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Decent bar prices and lots of room here to sit and mingle. Saw an music act here and although the door guys kept changing the cover charges for different  people at their own discretion it was overall a good experience. Owners are nice and a couple of the bartenders are rock solid, others are a bit slow and overwhelmed in my opinion. Haven't had the food yet. I will definitely swing back by this place on occasion. I think it has great potential and look forward to see how the vibe changes as they keep making improvements. They recently added lights for the stage area and the sound system was decent enough for the days I was there. Not smoky the days I've been there so that's a major plus in my book..."}
{"text":"I have had nothing but the best experiences with the place. The times I've been in the broads behind the counter have been nothing but SUPER friendly just BS'ing with us like long lost friends. Grace, and I believe the other one's name was Mimi. AMAZING service. Also, it's like, $4.75 for a beer that might as well be in a bucket. They won us over on our first visit and has become a regular spot for us. Haven't tried the food yet but have heard NOTHING but great things.   OH they also have a stage, that's lined with SUPER comfortable couches. WONDERFUL."}
{"text":"This place was super fun for karaoke! The drinks were decently priced and the atmosphere was very relaxed. I came here with my family who ranged in age from 34-79 and we all enjoyed ourselves. Nice bar food menu. Ordered French fries and they were good..just what you would want out of bar food fries. The only downfall was the group next to us smoked cigarettes constantly, which made it hard to breathe for us non-smokers...but other than that I have no complaints! Oh, and clean restrooms too! Friendly bartenders were the cherry on top! Will definitely be going back for Karaoke nights!"}
{"text":"The best buffalo wings in Las Vegas. Take a couple friends and order the bucket of wings. You get 21 awesome wings, but save room for the Pat LaFrieda Burger."}
{"text":"Bartender PRISCILLA delivers UNBELIEVABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE at the Charleston/Jones \"Time-Out:\"  1.) SHE WAS EXTREMELY POLITE on the phone--two weeks prior to my party's actual event night (Friday, Sept. 25th).  2.) SHE GREETED ME (and each of my friends) when I arrived.   3.) SHE EASILY ACCOMMODATED my large \"eatin,' drinkin,' and karaoke singin'\" party of around 15-20 guests.  4.) SHE NEVER APPEARED FLUSTERED or overworked,  although we were requiring her assistance practically every 5 to 10 minutes!  5.) SHE SEEMED GENUINELY DELIGHTED at the large gratuity I left--although I'm certain she earns big tips there every night!   Because of Priscilla, I rate this place 5 stars: But here is my honest opinion regarding the rest:  1.) Food is good, three stars. 2.) Food & drink pricing is competitive. 3.) Smoking section must be nearby outside, kind of smoky inside.  4.) Decor is traditional Vegas lounge, which is well-kept and clean.  5.) Karaoke host is friendly and competent, but the sound system is average-quality at best."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the ISLAND VIBE in this bar. Loved the music, staff was great, food was delicious. The only thing keeping me from going back to enjoy the island music is the smoking. I wish smoking were band in public areas. Other than that, it was a great place to hang out :)"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Amazing atmosphere. Bar none quality and service is exceptional! Priscilla & Victoria have hospitality like you're family the minute you walk through the door. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a place to unwind and have a 5 star cocktail!"}
{"text":"This place is great! A casual place to watch the game, reasonable priced drinks and very friendly staff! Nita was a great server!"}
{"text":"Awful!!! You know it's one thing to be a dive bar and hang on to that niche market of the locals and drunks. But to allow those people to affect other patrons nights is unbelievably sad. Now I have nothing against the LGBT community but there are several very aggressive females in here who continually made my girlfriend very uncomfortable with their advances and the bartenders and servers seemed to think think was hilarious. Secondly the DJ for karaoke by the name of Steveo caters to only his friends unless you \"tip him very well\" in his own words I happen to enjoy a karaoke night out but I would caution you to stay far away from this watering hole. Lastly if it's a dive bar maybe stop handing out free cocktails to your buddies so your drinks don't have to be overpriced for a actual paying customers just a thought. Time out? Yah that's a good name for a place that should stay in the sidelines."}
{"text":"Great divey little bar and the new management is excellent.   came here on lunch hour to watch the world cup game and got the hot wings and a beer. Hot wings were great, and everyone else I was with enjoyed their \"bar food\" lunch, chicken tenders, ranch chicken sandwich.   We got a free drink w check-in, And the new owner was so kind of give us complimentary cake pops and some coupons for next time.   Only complaint was that our food took awhile, maybe 45 minutes?  Def a bit long for a lunch break---they have a 10 minute menu, and I assume they're working out the kinks.  Will give them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"You hand em your drivers license, and you get headphones you can plug in and get audio to any of the  games you see. Brilliant."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews here, my expectations were high. And those  expectations were absolutely blown away! Wow! Wow! Wow! Bartender Priscilla took the best care of me with huge mugs of Lagunitas always at the ready and a great sense of humor to boot!. And Chef Chelsea made one of the Top 5 Tastiest grilled chicken sandwiches of my life!"}
{"text":"Low key atmosphere where everyone is a friend but it's large enough that if you want to watch a game in peace you can.  We got pizza and hot buffalo wings, both were excellent. The wings were true vinegar based buffalo wings. A true treat to find on the west coast!"}
{"text":"Pricilla.... bartender extrordanair! First time here. Had a great time. Good crowd. The burger was delicious. I'll be back."}
{"text":"As for being a Californian, the smell of cigarette smoke inside of a bar wasn't all that appealing to me.  Beer is beer, and I consumed a bit far too much than I needed to."}
{"text":"I love coming here.  They make you feel welcome.  The bartender, Nita, is always smiling and wonderful.   Definitely make your way out for Saturday night karaoke with DJ Wolf (aka Steveo) of you want an entertaining evening.  He plays a nice mix to dance to after rounds of hearing people sing.   He's quite the entertainer as well.  I love hearing him sing a song or two through the night."}
{"text":"When I come back to Vegas I'm going to to chill at this spot.  I feel like I'm home with Kameron (bartender) made me feel like I was home.  I could not have a a greater experience in Vegas.  The casino have nothing on this spot.  It is must to stop here and party! Pool tables and gambling machines.  The ambience is great!"}
{"text":"Shaggy was here and he said he did it!!!!  Trying a new karaoke bar and so far it's been awesome when your first shots and beer are on the house!!!!  Phil is fucking awesome!!!!"}
