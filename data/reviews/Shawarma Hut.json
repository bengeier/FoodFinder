{"text":"I love this place! I've been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. The food is absolutely delicious and the staff is always very pleasant. I've tried a lot of shawarma places, but this is hands down my favorite. Amazing!"}
{"text":"The service here was awesome. I landed myself at night to this location, It was one of those days I was craving a shawarama late at night and I went to Lazzez but it has become a no zone was quick grab and go as the lineups are too long...  So I left that place and came to this location. The owner was done and closing the location, but he said he can turn the grill on and gave me food. I was looking to buy just the meat and it was decent. The other things on the menu seemed pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I go here regularly because it's next to my workplace. Most of the time it's pretty good. Sometimes it doesn't taste as well but most times it's good. I go at lunch and it's usually busy. There are better shawarma places. Also the rules they have about extra ketchup and sauce is stupid. If you dine in they give you ketchup and sauce but if your take our then you can't."}
{"text":"I've herd good things about the hut! Had to come down and taste for myself.  I grabbed a chicken on the rocks, medium spice as always.  $10.16 after tax, smaller portion size than lazeez and osmows on the rocks dishes, roughly the same size as their small dishes.  Also came with a pita and tomato onion salad.  Tasted good! The shawarma is perfectly cooked and reminiscent of traditional cooked chicken shawarma that is well done and has a crispy but flavorful bite. The sauces are great too, hot sauce reminded me of a spicy chipotle aioli, and the rice was beautifully seasoned basmati rice.  I'd suggest everyone try it out and have a taste for themselves! Very friendly service as well.  Some downsides where the size of the dish (wish it was more comparable to the competition), a little messy inside the restaurant, just needs some TLC and some organization, but other than that a nice establishment.  Come try for yourself."}
