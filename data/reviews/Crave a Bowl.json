{"text":"I wasn't craving this place before I tried it and probably won't crave it in the future but it was, for the most part, nothing shy of tasty. The options are good, the specialty burrito bowl was filling and pretty appetizing. Notes however, the rice lacked flavor and the queso was very much like a melted block of velveeta cheese, thick and filling but very commercial tasting. I can't say I felt I did the right thing for my health but the ingredients overall tasted fairly fresh and the variety was phenomenal plus they don't charge extra for the guac. Still, I think their flavor combinations seem appetizing overall and the Asian bowl caught my eye and may get me to return. The service was pretty friendly though they didn't do much to explain my options so I felt the restaurant lacked the \"new car smell\" I.e. \"might I suggest the special?\". The three bowl sizes are also a nice concept and you could definitely get two meals out of the large bowl at $9.99 so the price point is probably right. The small bowl at $4.99 could also be the perfect \"before night class\" snack. The place is clean and spacious and ambience is classic college town restaurant. Worth giving it a shot."}
{"text":"Rating from a college student perspective. I got the Mediterranean pre-made bowl and my friends opted to make their own bowls. Overall: 3.8/5. Details below.

Decor: 4/5 It's clean. Looks just like the old Qdoba. Can't really complain as a college student looking for a quick bite.
Music: N/A
Food presentation: 3/5 You're getting a bowl full of different toppings depending on what you ordered. Everything is generally piled up on top of each other. Not really expecting much design from a bowl anyways.
Flavor: 4/5 It was good, but not \"Oh my goodness, this is amazing\" good. It of course will depend your preferred tastes.
Price: 3.5/5 On one hand, the large is ten dollars and it feels pretty bad to be paying ten dollars as a college student for a meal, when there are cheaper options that are just as good. On another hand, the regular size is close to six dollars, which is extremely affordable. Unfortunately, the sizing of the bowl is on the smaller side, so as a fully grown male, the regular won't fill you. We had a large bubble tea from nearby with our meal, and with regular size and large bubble tea, we only could feel satisfied at best. 
Service: 5/5 Really friendly people and pretty helpful in terms of deciding what to eat. 
Bathrooms: N/A. If things follow suit, it'll be the same as the old Qdoba bathrooms.

Would I come back again?
Maybe. If I'm really hungering for a specific type of bowl or wanting to mix things up, I'd come back. But for the price to food ratio quantity, it would definitely be lower on the priority list.

Final thoughts:
Honestly, it's decently good food. It just feels bad because I know there are more filling options for cheaper prices with about the same quality of food. If I want a salad, there's Hello Bistro. If I want a burrito styled bowl, I'd go to Chipotle. I think Crave a Bowl is a niche restaurant, but a decently good one, at that."}
{"text":"Crave a bowl has replaced Qdoba on Forbes Avenue. It was opening day and they weren't busy. I did a create your own regular sized bowl but they also have some premade options. Essentially, there are several bases, proteins, lots of veggies, sauces, and toppings. I had the tricolored rice, beans, chicken, tomatoes, edamame, pickled jalape√±os, carrots, cabbage, queso, salsa verde, sour cream, and tortilla chips. The price was very reasonable as the regular bowl was $6.99. They do not accept cash. The bowl was pretty good but could have used some seasoning. The amount of toppings can get overwhelming. I don't know if it will be able to compete with establishments like hello bistro and chipotle. Overall, I would come back to try different creations! The regular bowl was a very filling lunch. Would want to come back to try some of the other sauces."}
{"text":"While I am devastated that Q'doba is gone, I tried my best to not let that affect my judgement of this place. It's close to my office so I really wanted to like it. I did not. 

Staff: underwhelming, indifferent
Choices: lots 
Prices: fair
Flavor: none
Decor: minimal, clean 

I got the buffalo chicken signature bowl. It was easy to make changes to the pre set toppings as I didn't want a few of them. The bowl itself looked delicious once assembled. Very bright, hearty, and colorful. But that's where it ended. It lacked any real flavor. There weren't any ingredients that stood out. Lackluster. 

meh."}
