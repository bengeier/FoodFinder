{"text":"Damn good coffee! Great lunch and specials."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving. From the outside it doesn't look great, but inside the food is excellent. Best coffee in town."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the coffee and the clean tasting food.   I wasn't expecting much of the small coffee shop, but they had a Thrifty Ice Cream poster hanging in the window, so obviously they had some good taste.  I decided not to get ice cream when I saw the in-house made pastries. In the other reviews someone said the lemon bars were worth trying... oh yeah they're good.   I ordered a veggie wrap with hummus... so clean tasting, and guilt free.  I was surprised it was as good as it was.   I also ordered an iced macchiato, delicious as well... and it didn't have that bitter-burnt Starbucks taste.   There are not a lot of options for lunch in Youngtown, but this is a great choice.   Ther also have a large outdoor area, and if you choose to sit inside it is nicely decorated."}
{"text":"Kindred Spirits has closed their doors. It is a sad thing that we on the west side of Phoenix cannot support such a friendly and community oriented business, AND one that gave you the option to drop by for a quick coffee or for a more complete dining experience. The live music on the weekends was also something a bit rare for our side of town, and will be missed. Richard and Debra did a marvelous job updating the space, and making it a warm and welcoming place. I am sorry that Youngtown has lost this business."}
