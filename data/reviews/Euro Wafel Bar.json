{"text":"My wife and I were looking forward to eating liege waffles but left disappointed.  The dough did not have the caramelized sugar or texture associated with liege waffles and my wife's waffle was undercooked.  The toppings were skimpy and the service was meh.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Greatly priced and tasty Crepes. Wonderful selection and frendly staff. Always take the chefs suggestion. Definitely a gem."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to going there and trying the waffles. . Unfortunately I never got to try them. Although the person making the waffles was wearing gloves, he also wiped the counter with a used rag while wearing the same gloves then went right back to cutting fruit. I was really disgusted by this.  A person who works in the food industry should know better. It was very unsanitary and I threw the waffle out. While leaving I overheard 2 people talking about how undercooked their waffles were. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice a few months apart. The first time was good and the most recent was...a mess. Both times they ran out of certain toppings, which was understandable the first time as they recently opened, but at this point they should know how much to stock and prepare.   Their milkshake menu is so misleading! On the menu: \"Oreo marshmallow-Cookies & cream ice cream and Oreos topped with marshmallows, whipped cream, and Oreo crumble\" What you actually get is a cookies & cream milk shake without any toppings...And I asked them about it and they said to receive the toppings was an extra $1 upgrade. They did give me the toppings for free because I asked about it...but clarity would be nice because the item description should include everything listed for that set price. It would be like ordering a burger and being told having a meat patty is $1 extra.   They got the ice cream flavor incorrect for the wafel (ordered chocolate, received vanilla) but didn't have the heart to complain because of the whole milk shake issue. And when they delivered the food they didn't give utensils and they needed to be reminded twice before they got around to it, all the while the ice cream was melting. How did they expect us to eat it?  It's frustrating because the workers there are nice..but kind of incompetent. They got the order of the party behind us wrong too."}
{"text":"Yum! I love the waffles and crepes here!!!   It's a small place- usually crowded and not many places to sit at night but it's still worth the wait!"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall that is well worth finding. Great menu, might seem expensive for a waffle place for the McDonald's frequent customer... the coffee is also very unique, give it a shot to break your dunkin routine   Great staff there, love what they do and proud of the place"}
{"text":"So how is the food at Euro Wafel Bar? The most important thing you need to know is it's about to be one of the best places in the city.  We ordered the speculoos which is a cookie butter and it had strawberries,whip cream, and heavenly powdered sugar...so simple but so damn good! The wafel is made with dough and it definitely is a unique texture that will make you just mmmmm as soon as you eat it. Euro has taken the wafel crown! It's like the Candy Land of Dessert!!! The menu is filled with absolute ridiculousness, including items from the Strawbana with strawberries,banana,and whip cream, the Brasilliene, which has caramel, speculoos,whip and ice cream on the  menu. If Parisienne with brie cheese, honey,and maple syrup and caramel pretzel pancakes don't sound crazy enough, a simple but delightful wafle will do the trick!  My only suggestion for the owner would be to go local with his ice cream, he said he uses Pierre's ice cream, but i'm all about keeping things simple, small, and local.   Here's what Euro Wafel Bar is not:a terrible tasting wafel place, with bad customer service... When I called the delivery number to find out where it was located in Tower City, I spoke with the owner and he told me where and said they would be closing soon, we were eating dinner somewhere else and he was kind enough to wait on us after his location closed. And ladies the owner is very easy on the eyes, so watching a handsome man make your wafel is definitely a perk!"}
{"text":"The service is great. The guy is friendly and attentive. I thought it was pretty pricey for a place with no sitting area. Around $7-$9 for waffle with fruit and chocolate.  They really need to improve their presentation too. Looking at the display is pretty sad.   They offer Rising star coffee which is great!!  I really miss good Belgian waffles so I see myself coming back here often. I am happy they exist! I really hope they put more thought behind presentation so they can get more costumers. It is hard to find them. You have to walk towards the Reinnassence Hotel entrance from the inside of Tower City."}
{"text":"Euro Wafel was a pleasant surprise! I've heard mixed reviews about this place, but since it's so close to me, I had to try it out. Nestled in between Huntington Bank and the entrance to The Triangle Apartments (tower 1), it's easy to miss. Their waffles aren't the normal, make-at-home-with-mix kind, but thick, hearty waffles with some of the most heavenly toppings ever. I don't even have a sweet tooth, and I devoured my waffle.   Their crepes are also amazing. As I was starving after a long workday, I needed two items to whet my appetite. The deluxe veggie crepe was phenomenal! It would be fine on its own if you weren't as hungry as I was. While getting two meals was a tad pricey, I'll definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"This Wafel bar will make you feel like you have a pocketful of sunshine. Where else can you jam out to Frank Sinatra classics at midnight while enjoying a scoop of ice cream next to a freshly made Nutella-drizzled strawberry-topped Belgian Wafel?  That's right. Pocketful of sunshine.  2 things make this Wafel bar stand out:  1. Customer service - you know your Wafel is in good hands when the person making the Wafel is passionate about making the best one yet. Always courteous and enthusiastic. Also transparent - sometimes they run out of ingredients, but they will let you know ahead of time and provide an alternative when you order. Your go-to vending machine wishes it had this kind of transparency.  2. Variety variety variety. Check out that menu of combinations. I didn't know Belgian wafels could be topped with so many different ingredients from savory to sweet. Also check out the new brunch items (ahem...chicken and wafels...must try).   Your artistic dessert Wafel will be about $6-7 - pricier than typical desserts in the Uptown area, but it's unique and delicious, worth it in my opinion! Recommend bringing a friend and splitting a Wafel. Or if you're feeling the sweet tooth, have your own!"}
{"text":"Came here twice and had the Lucie (amazing) and the club (pretty good). The waffles are amazingly crispy on the outside without being oily and pillowy on the inside. Friendly staff and open at great hours for students who study late. Great taste in music too.  Oh, also had the Nutella and cookie shake. It was amazing, but near impossible to drink with a straw because it was so thick.  Only reason why I am leaving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the inside ambiance, despite being very cozy, is really smoky and poorly ventilated."}
{"text":"Four stars vs. 5 is more an indication that they are still working through startup issues.  I fully anticipate they  will be up to five stars soon.  My Parisienne wafel (correct spelling, it appears) was great, and I look forward to trying their other offerings.  Rising Star coffee was an added bonus.  A navigation tip:  Euro Wafel is located in the corridor connecting the Renaissance Hotel with the rest of Tower City."}
{"text":"Timeliness: 5/10  Taste: 9/10 Price: 6/10   Overall, I love to go to Euro Wafel with my friends when we're craving something sweet. One downside is the price for what you get. You get a tiny waffle or crepe for almost $7 or $8, which is way over priced for the ingredients they use.   I love the texture of the waffles and love many of the combos. My go to is the Nutella and strawberries - can't remember the name of this combo. The food tastes great, but it does take them awhile to make and is overpriced."}
{"text":"Smh .. they need help bad  , I used to eat these waffles when they were located in Beachwood mall .they're way to busy for one person to be cooking , the food isn't quality as it once was , I like to support it because I've been goin there since It opened , but i hope they get help in there."}
{"text":"I love this concept of a waffle bar! It's so unique and you won't find many places like it. There is plenty of variety for every palette, even the adventurous ones. The cookie butter is a must try, especially if you are a peanut butter fan (or not). The texture is similar, but of course it is much sweeter. The waffle is made from dough so if you like your waffles a bit softer, go with the liege waffle option. I also recommend trying the Rising Star coffee.  The service was great. The owner is personable and very attentive. He likes to have conversations with his customers and get to know them. There is also a lot to choose from on the menu, so he is very helpful in picking out something that you will like.   My only complaint about this place is that it's hard to find. There is no clear sign outside the building saying \"Euro Wafel Bar.\" When you map it based on the address, it takes you to the front of tower city on Huron rather than the public square side, which is where this is located. My friend and I wandered around Tower City for a minute to find it. The best way to get there is to go in the door to the left of the Renaissance Hotel in public square. It'll be to the left once you go in.  Summary:  A great hole in the wall place worth finding and worth returning to!"}
{"text":"I had the halal chicken and waffles (I only eat halal so I was surprised when I seen it on the menu). The chicken was well prepared with cookie butter instead of syrup draped on top and went well with sriracha.   My wife had the ferrero rocher waffle with a scoop of ice cream. She said she was expecting it to be a heavy desert but was surprised as the waffles were not overly dense. Also the chocolate and ice cream paired well together as the classic combo they are.   The food here is wonderful but what makes this place great is the friendly and upbeat staff. The guys behind the counter were very helpful and entertaining. At a few points throughout the night they the offered everyone who ate in the restaurant Turkish coffee on the house. (They don't have to go cups for the coffee)"}
{"text":"Delicious, one of a kind, unique place near the Case campus. I had the cheesecake waffle and it was great, especially with a scoop of ice cream and some Turkish coffee on the side!!!"}
{"text":"A very fun concept! Really unique and delicious combinations. My favorite of the sweet waffles is the Dame Blanche. My favorite savory menu item is the honey dijon chicken crepe. I love to support this local business, and have enjoyed watching them grow from a pop- up bodega run out of a local hookah bar to a successful restaurant with a steady customer base.  Four stars instead of five because since they opened, they've said they would deliver, and every time I have called to order delivery they tell me they are too busy and cannot."}
{"text":"Great selection.  Great combinations of flavors.  Great service.  Great portions.  It's kind of tucked away, near a bank.  The last time I went though, my friend ordered something and they did not have certain ingredients.  She had to change her order.  She was very happy with what she got.  I read another review which criticized this place because the Belgium waffles are not authentic.  So?  I've been to Belgium and had waffles there.  There not the same, but that doesn't mean the waffles at Euro Wafle are not delicious still.  I'm from San Diego, CA.  I could say the same thing about the Mexican food in Cleveland...or I could just enjoy what Cleveland has to offer."}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly and patient..even when I'm staring at the menu for what seems like hours trying to narrow my pick of which waffle combination I'm going with for the night. Luckily, I've been able to minimize my waffle addiction. Literally there was a point when my friend and I were eating waffles 3x a week. Recommend all of the sweet waffles. Sadly I don't think they have the cheesecake ice cream or the cookie butter one... THOSE WERE GAME CHANGERS. If management reads these please bring those back !! :("}
{"text":"Wow delicious waffles and excellent customer service. Husband and I went pretty early in the evening when the place first opened at 8, so there was no wait time. Two very friendly guys working behind the counter. The smell was amazing, and choosing a waffle was an incredibly difficult decision. I asked about how the waffles were made, and both men assured me that all dough was made in-house as well as the crepe batter. I joked that there was no way the could be better than my grandma's waffles...I stand corrected. Perfectly cooked, solid amount of quality toppings, and the vanilla ice cream was perfect on top. I will 100% come back again. The price was on the higher end, but having experience making yeast-based doughs, the effort is more intensive than just mixing some dried ingredients with water. Crepes are also a pain to make, and do require some skill. Well worth the price in the end for quality."}
{"text":"Person helping us was extremely helpful and kind. Really helped us with suggestions and brought out water for my girlfriends mother instinctually when she had a coughing fit. Food was pretty good but the service made this a five star review. Thank you, whoever was working right before the time of this review."}
{"text":"Open late for an after drink binge.  They have a surprisingly large menu with savory, fruity and sweet.  We ordered the Monte Cristo and the Tropicana fruity waffle with cookie butter. The staff was helpful with our choice and the food came out promptly.  The Cristo only comes as a crepe and we made the fruity one a brussels; basically a classic waffle. I liked the Tropicana better than the Monte Cristo.  I felt the jam they used was a bit lighter than I would have preferred.  I like darker berry jams with my Cristos.  The Tropicana was awesome!  It had two banana halves, strawberries, blueberries and was covered with whipped cream.  My only complaint being a small portion of the waffle was burned, I think it was some sugar crystals in the batter making its way to the iron.    I'm super excited to go back.  I was told that the bubble waffle is amazing with ice cream, it was described as bubble wrap.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Truly a 5-Star place. I can't say enough about it. Unique product that is executed to perfection. The owners are the nicest, kindest and most hospitable people you will find. Authentic, amazing food at an incredibly affordable price. I mean, just look at the wafel I got. Nutella, cookie butter, Caramel, ice cream...all topped on a piping hot fresh wafel. Their menu is complete with both savory and sweet wafels and crepes as well as shakes and lemonades. I cannot wait to come back again. 5 stars all around. I wish I could rate it higher than 5."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I've had liege waffles and these aren't up to par, especially considering the price. For an $8 waffle, I wanted more.   Originally, I ordered a strawberry waffle but I was informed they just ran out. It was early afternoon on a weekday. Okay, it happens. My second choice was unavailable as well. I finally just asked him to use whatever fruit they did have so I could get going.   The best part of a liege waffle are the little pockets of sugar. There were none. The waffle was very tough as well. If you get it with loads of Nutella maybe it's not as noticeable. I'm not into Nutella since I have yet to detect a hint of hazelnut....but I digress.   This place has potential if they can tweak the waffle recipe and keep basic ingredients in stock. A smaller, less expensive waffle option may be a good idea as well.   Location in the mall: in between Kay Jewelers and the VS Pink store."}
{"text":"Delicious, well prepared wafel. They know waffles. Variety of coffee is small but each brew is delicious.  I would like to see a store front, with a bigger menu but for Belgium wafel restaurant in Tower City and Beachwood Mall your not going to find anything like it in the city. Its pricey until you eat it, the taste experience in the area make it well worth the price I think."}
{"text":"Honestly, the food here is amazing, and I love the idea of a late night treat.  Sadly, they just can't seem to meet demand. The wait can be as long as 15 minutes when you're the only one in the store, and the place gets packed pretty quickly. I've had waffles so burnt I broke utensils. They list their hours until 2am,  but by 1, they'll be long closed. I still can't help but come back because the concept is just great, but it's so inconsistent it's frustrating."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go for a late night snack. The waffles are absolutely bomb. They have both sweet and savory waffles. The waffles and toppings are always fresh. I normally get to Utopia waffle which is the best waffle I've ever had with the best toppings ever.  The staff is very friendly and the environment  is really chill.  It's a nice place to go on a late night when you just left the bar and have a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"If you're in the University Circle area stop into Euro Wafel, well worth it. They have savory and sweet Crepes and Waffles for a tasty meal or dessert.  The service was friendly and the atmosphere was relaxing."}
{"text":"This adventure started with two young people, awake, famished, and ready to have some delicious waffles. They took and Uber and found what may have been the correct door. What they did not find was - waffles. Theses brunchers wandered the halls of Tower City. I called this number on Yelp - voicemail. What was going on? Bruncher #2 suggested going on their website. Said site said they were located in University Circle. Further confusion and desperation ensued. I called the number on the website, and... They're only in Beachwood?! There are not enough emoji to describe the despair these two adventurers experienced. Alas, waffles were not had.  Tldr; THE WAFFLE IS A LIE"}
{"text":"This place is very trendy.  It looks like a hang out for the local college students. I ordered one of the waffles. They also have crepes. The waffle was very good and had a very distinctive taste. My only complaint would be that there was not enough fruit on it. The place is very small and was standing room only when I was there. There was a line waiting for the place to open and it is open late for those of you that have the late night munchies.  I would definitely go to this place again while I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I've been craving a waffle for like eight months now and haven't been able to find one that satisfied my craving... until now! We called ahead to see what the hours were and the owner said they'd be closing between 7 and 8pm, but he stayed open until we could rush over there which was really nice of him. Once inside Tower City we couldn't find the stand right away, but another quick call to the owner and before we knew it, voilà! delicious Belgian waffles for everyone! The owner was very friendly and readily provided information about his unique product.   We both got a waffle with speculoos (cookie butter) drizzled over it with fresh cut strawberries, a big shot of whip cream, and a light dusting of powdered sugar. The waffles are made with dough instead of batter which gives them this nice crispy outside and a soft doughy inside. I've never had speculoos before, but this stuff is delicious! The strawberries added a nice fresh cut to the other toppings, and this waffle was just overall a very pleasing yummy treat!  I didn't have a ruler with me, but I'd say the waffles are about 5x4 inches big and mine came to $9. I think this is a little pricey even for a fancy dessert waffle, but it's downtown Cleveland and the waffle was damn tasty. I would definitely recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"Located just inside the entrance to the Terminal Tower near the doors to the hotel.  This little Euro style Belgian waffle counter is the real deal.  Mixing up the best batter and using the secret ingredient of a \"true\" Belgian waffle this little gem reminds me of the best places tucked into those cobblestone streets of Europe.   Great variety and super friendly staff.  Don't miss getting a little taste of Europe in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I've been to Europe plenty of times and I know a good waffel. And this waffle was horrible. I will never go back to this place again."}
{"text":"It was a little hard to find but once we called and got step by step instructions it was WELL worth the walk. Turns out, Mo who took our order was also the owner and he was super informative about everything on the menu. We ended up ordering the Strawberry and Banana Foster, the Cinaroll and the Honey Dijon Chicken Crepe. The presentation was beautiful, and the dishes were even better. We got our food so fast too! Def coming back ;^)"}
{"text":"Just  amazing!!! I first had this type of waffle in Florence Italy.. they have done a great  job! You  won't be  disappointed"}
{"text":"The late night food option that University Circle desperately needed. The wafels are doughy and fresh, and they have a large variety of toppings to choose from. My only major gripe with the place is the use of styrofoam to serve all of the wafels. Additionally they deliver, so if you don't want to get out of bet at 1am, but really need a wafel, just call them."}
{"text":"I've been to Beachwood Place plenty of times, but only recently did I find the most intriguing dessert stand I've ever encountered.  My attention was captured by the different waffles covered in Nutella, cookie butter, caramel, and fruit through the display. However, I would never have though these dessert waffles would have tasted so great.  The unique taste of the fresh, European \"wafel\" combined with the classic, delicious taste of cookie butter, Nutella, or caramel and fruit results in some taste bud fireworks.    Personally, my favorites are the Brasilliene (Waffle with caramel, cookie butter, whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, and hazelnut cookie crumble) and the WMD (Waffle with Nutella, cookie butter, strawberries, bananas, whipped cream, and vanilla ice cream).  The guys that work behind the counter are super cool, and very friendly.  After my second time coming here, they knew me by name, and even gave me a discount for attending school around the area.  Oh, and by the way, they also deliver around University Circle, DT Cleveland, and Cleveland Heights until 2 AM!"}
{"text":"This is a review for the location in University Circle.  Waffles were good, but pricey. I shared the \"savory\" liege waffle with brie with a friend - would recommend.  Location is a little difficult for people who do not come by UC often. They are also not open during the day.  I would not come here often, but recommend for people to try at least once."}
{"text":"Words can not express the greatness of this waffle. Just watching the man make it, made my taste bud start jumping. It was made with so much TLC! Delicious... That's all that needs to be said about it!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is worth checking out! Located on the second level of the mall, Euro Wafel Bar serves up a variety of freshly made sweet and savory Belgian waffles. The customer service here is very good and waffle suggestions are given. I stopped here for a sweet snack and I decided on the featured Wafel of the day which was the Brasilliene Wafel($8) a freshly made Wafel topped with caramel, cookie butter, vanilla cookie crumbles, vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and a vanilla wafer cookie. This Wafel was sooo good. The Wafel texture was firm outside and dense and moist inside. The flavors of the sweet toppings and vanilla ice cream made this dessert wafel a big hit with me.  NOTE: The Downtown location is OPEN, but closes at noon."}
{"text":"We got napolian waffle. It was just a regular waffle. Nothing special. They said it was brioche waffle and a taste like a regular waffle nothing Belgium or Brussels about it. I wouldn't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"This place was a little hard to find at night, because their sign doesn't have any lights, but it was worth the search. There's close public parking nearby and they are conveniently open late, until 2am the day we were there. We ordered a waffle and a breakfast crepe and both were really good and filling. The men who were working were very friendly and working hard, as they were kinda busy on a Friday night. However, the service was a little slow, the lemonade was average, and the place itself was small and therefore, crowded."}
{"text":"Customer service was great. Small establishment w/ limited seating. Had the spicy vegetarian, was good. They definitely didn't skimp on the filling. Was able to add cheese w/o an up charge. Others in my group all opted for sweet waffles & milkshakes. Only negative I have, wish they would lower temperature on making the crepes, allowing the filling to warm & cheese to melt. Will definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Excellent customer service. That alone makes me want to support this business. They are very nice and are EXCITED about what they sell. They are so willing to offer suggestions of what to pick.   A perfect after dinner dessert. We got two separate things. But i think we would've been fine splitting one!"}
{"text":"Authentic Belgian waffles and a much-needed gourmet coffee offering in Tower City. Proprietors are nice chaps who really care about what they're doing. This started as a pop-up but now has a more permanent home. They're tucked away by the newsstand, so easy to miss but well worth seeking out."}
{"text":"Super delicious waffle! The waffle with the cookie butter is amazing. The owner guy is funny. Can't wait to come back! Watch out for the funky hours- doesn't open until 8 PM. Definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"There were a great selection of all types of waffles. Came with some ice cream and was reasonably priced. Great spot for dessert! The waffles were very bomb. Great new restaurant for the area.   The portion sizes are good to share between 2 to 3 people for a small tasting but of course, if you're feeling your sweet tooth, you can also easily finish one yourself.   I came with a bunch of friends and although there was limited seating we were able to go to the lounge right next door. The waffles came in Styrofoam boxes so easy to take out. Plastic utensils and napkins were provided.   I got the paradise waffle and although they did not have the cookie butter ice cream, the oreo ice cream made a great combination with the waffle. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"We came here and happened to be the only people in at the time. The owner was there and was extremely nice and made sure we had everything we needed so needless to say the service was amazing. We tried the blackberry lemonade-amazing! I had the Ferraro rocher waffle with strawberries and Nutella, ughhhhhh soooo good. The presentation itself was just mouth watering. Definitely loved this place!"}
{"text":"Walking in we were greeted right away by a friendly, smiling employee. He guided us through the menu, and he kindly answered our questions. Going off the fact that I enjoy banana and strawberry, I decided on the Napoleon French Waffle. It included bananas, strawberries, Nutella, cookie butter, whipped cream, and a giant scoop of ice cream.  The wait for the waffle was only about ten minutes, and it was worth it because they make the dough from scratch and cook the waffle in front of you, so that takes some time. The waffle was about six dollars and was big enough for both my father and me to enjoy. The waffle was crisp and warm with a Nutella drizzle, and it had the fruits cut up around it. The ice cream was on top of the waffle, along with all of the other toppings. And, it tasted even better than it looked, which is an accomplishment on its own because it looked amazing. The only problem we had with it was that we ordered vanilla ice cream, but they gave us cookies n' cream instead. However, I believe this happened because the person serving us seemed new. The restaurant was over all clean and welcoming, and there was very little that was missing. The only thing was that they only had two soda choices: Sprite and Root beer. Personally it does not matter to me, however my dad enjoys drinking Diet Coke when he eats, and he did not have that choice there.  All in all, the waffle was amazing, and it was definitely a place I would go back to and recommend."}
{"text":"Everybody seems to love this place so I finally decided to check it out. First of all, the customer service is out of this world, and the waffles are AMAZING. They are reasonably priced and to top it off they are huge and shareable. I always get the waffle a la mode, which comes with a generous scoop. Some of my favorite flavors are: -Strawberry cheesecake w/ strawberry cheesecake ice cream  -Banana foster w/ cinnamon ice cream  -Nutella waffle w/ vanilla ice cream  Trust me you gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"I always get the cheese and tomato crepe and it is consistently good for when I want something cheesy that isn't too bland, and is not a grilled cheese. I've also had the waffle with the Nutella and Oreo topping, and it was good."}
{"text":"Love love love! Was super impressed with the waffles! Amazing menu of crepes and waffles AND ice cream!!! They were so fricking amazingly, goood! Loved the service! The guy who runs it was very conversational and very friendly!"}
{"text":"This is a small,  hope in the wall joint that you just can't miss.  The owner of this place really is proud of his creations which you ll feel in every bite you eat, in the ambience and the customer service. I'm going her again and again. Loaded delicious waffles and crepes!"}
{"text":"Delicious dessert waffles! I had the Ferraro Rocher, which came with a scoop of (choice of vanilla, chocolate, cookies and cream) ice cream, Nutella drizzle, strawberries, whipped cream and a ferrero rocher. The waffle it came with had a sugary/syrupy filling. Sooo good."}
{"text":"Went to the pop up shop inside Rising Star Cafe of Little Italy on a Sunday afternoon just before it began down pouring. I wasn't upset we had to stay inside after smelling Whodafa's (first name of the owner) waffles.   My boyfriend got the stuffed cookie batter and I got Nutella. I recommended trying the cookie batter because it was so much better than classic Nutella.   He makes them with a soft dough rather than a thick batter like most do. The batter allows the waffle to be crispier and thinner while still being fulfilling without excess dough. This difference along with the fresh made to order aspect really makes these waffles worth returning for.   Be aware as other commenters have stated, the waffles are pricy starting at $9 but they're worth every penny! And who wouldn't be happy helping out an entrepreneur enjoying himself as much as Whodafa does by doing what he loves?"}
{"text":"I would definitely check out this place again! A lot of options and you get more than what you'd expect from a typical waffle bar! The service was great - the owner is very personable with the customers and was helpful in choosing what kind of creation I wanted. Next time I'll be tasting the coffee because the waffle alone leaves you full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Based on yelp reviews took a 30 minute trip to go there today & got there just after noon at 12:10. Right on the door it said \"open every day 12PM-3PM\", but doors were locked, lights were off & the chairs were up.  There were large bags of trash in clear plastic bags in front of the entrance...disgusting. I called their # and their mailbox was full!  Went on their website and they actually had 2 different sets of hours for Sunday 12PM-3Pm and 9AM-2:00AM!  What a cluster.  How do mismanaged restaurants like this stay in business?  Horrible. Based on the trash, i c that everything is served in styrofoam boxes yuk & uggh. Why not save $ and the environment & use real plates?  Hope whatever bank is lending them $, is reading this as they clearly don't know how to manage a restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is tucked away but once you discover it, you're going to end up here every evening. Their savory crepes are amazing! So much keen attention goes into every crepe/ waffle made. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The Verdict: YUM YUM YUM!!!  The Food: I've tried almost all the specials and different types of waffles! My favorite is the crepe Napoleon! Wowowow! So sweet and sugary and yummy! Perfect fixing when you want dessert but Cleveland is not like NYC so EVERYTHING is closed @ night. It also comes with a scoop of ice cream and I usually choose btwn cookies and cream or vanilla. They also offer savory type and even milkshakes!  The Extras: When you order, the menu is all the way in the back, so sometimes you have to find out where the line starts when it's packed since some are waiting for their waffles and some are in line. As for the menu, Step 1: Choose the type of sugary heaven carb you want (liege waffle/brussels waffle/crepe) What's the difference btwn liege and brussels waffles you ask? Well I'm glad you did! Liege is a more flour, doughy, and thicker kind of waffle whereas brussels is more light and crispy. Although the menu does say bubble waffle (they're the hong-kong style), as of this time, they don't have the machine to make it yet. Step 2: Choose the interesting name you want to get on the menu. You can always ask to substitute something out!   It's located right next to the Huntington bank. The inside has 3 tables, each can seat about 4 people, there's also single seating like a bar style for about 5 people. On a good night (since they only open 6PM-2AM), there's a few tables outside and if you need more seating, just around the building are huge picnic tables on the lawn! The workers are REALLY sweet and nice, most of them are youngsters who go to case or nearby colleges. As for the wait time, it really depends on the people traffic. I've waited as long as 45 minutes before! The wait is short early in the night and in the summer since students have left for break. You can always ask how long it'll take! They take both card and cash!"}
{"text":"Great waffle bar! The Napoli waffle was so delicious. It was one of the best waffles I've ever had. The place is small so seating can be difficult but it's manageable. They aren't fastest but everything is made right there in front of you so it's worth the wait!! The owner is soooo nice and very helpful. You can tell he cares. They also gave us free Turkish coffee with our order. We really loved this place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"The newest addition to Tower City is definitely a wonderful one!! It's located in a small stand towards the Tower City entrance on the Public Square side - on the side that has the door leading to the Renaissance hotel. Although small and unassuming, with just chalkboards filled with menu items lining the walls, this place has some VERY delicious dessert options (breakfast? late night bite? whatever you consider these waffle delicacies) to offer!  I finally wandered over to Tower City for breakfast after reading the existing raving reviews about the waffles. I'm not even exaggerating when I say I walked around tower city for 10 minutes before finding a couple eating the waffles and finally getting good directions from them as to where the stand was located. I tried calling the owner a few times before this, but there was no answer- and when I got to the stand, I understood why. He was the sole person manning the stand and the line was about 10 deep.   The owner had a food truck before opening the shop and now has two- one here in tower city and one in university circle. I was reading an article on him, and the owner discovered this style of waffle while traveling in Europe. Rather than using batter, he uses dough. You can see him preparing your fresh waffle and he literally presses it into the iron until it's cooked to perfection - and I can definitely taste the difference.  I opted for the Parisienne savory option AND the Heavenly sweet option. I figured I would eat half of each for a taste (we won't get into the fact that I ended up finishing both leftover halves an hour later....) I also ordered the Nutella Macchiato to give it a try (and I'm always down for anything Nutella). The Parisienne had brie, honey, and maple syrup and was DELICIOUS- could have used a little more syrup, though. I folded it up and ate it like a sandwich! The Heavenly waffle had nutella, strawberries, and whipped cream and was just as delicious. These waffles just have a tiny hint of sweetness alone, so they are easily able to be paired with sweet toppings to satisfy any sweet tooth without overdoing it! The coffee (I believe they use Rising Star Coffee!) was really good, too. I didn't taste the Nutella much, and I realized why when I neared the end of my cup and opened the top and saw all the nutella stuck on the side. Coffee tasted just fine without it, so Im not upset by it.   Overall, I did spend 23 dollars for my 2 gourmet waffles and macchiato - which is a bit steep in my opinion. However, I think it's definitely worth it, and I will definitely be back for treats - I just don't think I'll be here daily for a waffle fix! They reopen at night and offer delivery so I can definitely see myself coming by for a late night waffle after a night out!   -- PS don't try to be fancy and eat this with a fork and knife, just pick it up and indulge :)"}
