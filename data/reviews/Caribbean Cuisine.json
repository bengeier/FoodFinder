{"text":"My first time eating Caribbean food period and I was not disappointed. I tried the ox tails, they were really good and they gave me a lot of food. I tried my boyfriends jerk chicken which was also excellent."}
{"text":"This place was so good!! I had been craving doubles for months and I was pleasantly surprised by how good these were. Even though the restaurant is a bit far from my house, I will definitely make the drive...frequently!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! They pack the plate, that I couldn't eat it all. The lady/cook (not sure if she's the owner) was Very friendly. They also gave us free plantains, that were very tasty. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"After backpacking Dominican republic I have been looking for something relatively close to island cuisine, this is definitely the closest thing I have found in the states. The jerk chicken was full of flavor and had the perfect amount t of spice, the rice and peas were al dente exactly how they make them on the island. I will definetley be back to try their whole menu, a job well done!!!!"}
{"text":"The food tasted good, but the jerk chicken does not taste authentic at all; it tastes more like a spicy barbecue chicken. The gravy's are a little watered down as well."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and customer service was fantastic...I will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Being born and raised in New York City, I was exposed to Caribbean food everywhere. I don't miss NYC much but I DO miss the food. This restaurant brought me back! The staff went above and beyond when I told them how much I missed the food back home. I will forever be grateful for their courtesy and the absolute deliciousness of the food. I will most definitely be going back. The only thing missing was an ice cold banks....."}
{"text":"We had the oxtail stew and jerk chicken to go. OTS was good but not as flavorful as I wanted. JC was very good and tender with plenty of sauce. The best I've had in AZ. Cabbage taste better than expected. The staff was friendly, place was clean, but food took about 20 min to come which is average for small businesses like this."}
{"text":"This is a amazing place.  Great music and simply amazing food!!  The woman who cooked for me is so friendly and makes the best food.   I have tried other restaurants like this but this by far is the absolute best!  I highly recommend this to anyone!  Hurry and come try it out."}
{"text":"I am a foodie with Guyanese family members-- so I am EXTREMELY critical when someone claims they have Trini/Guyanese food. Before going to this restaurant, I called them to find out if this was TRULY a Trinidadian restaurant. Our food is a little different than Jamaican (LOL we put channa in everything, we cook our curry before adding meat, etc., LOL!). Here is the phone convo:

Me: Hello, do you have bussup shut roti and dhal puri?
Lady: Yes?
Me: Oh wait, are you Indian?
Lady: Yes.
Me: YES! Thank you! I have been looking for a real Trini restaurant for years and I finally found you! I will be there after work. 

I get there and there was one customer in front of me who said that she really liked the food, it was her third time there. They were playing loud dancehall music (YES!) I ordered the Oxtail plate (oxtail, rice n peas, plantain, cabbage) AND the curry channa and aloo plate with bussup shut, dal puri and a red Solo drink (I knew it was the real deal when I saw the solo drink, I eat a lot). 

The food was GREAT!! Even if you never had Trini/Guyanese food, this is great! Oxtail was tender. Rice was perfect, the channa was on point! The dal puri was STUFFED with split peas and the bussup shut (in Guyana we call it paratha) was buttery. It was a ton of food-- I didn't know if I got a ton of food because I asked for all of it in to-go plates or not. I asked them to play some Chutney music and they blasted it loud, just for me (yes I stopped in the middle of eating to dance)! I even had some Pholourie that almost brought me to tears. I had not had food from home in many years so this meant a lot to me.

The staff was very friendly too! It was just really refreshing to talk to Trini people again and sing Chutney songs. 

Highly recommended if you are looking for Island food. I am going back tonight! I need to go back when they make Doubles and Aloo pie too (Saturdays)."}
{"text":"Food was good...had the oxtails. Generous portions. Small and basic but clean. The deterrent...flies. My companion and I told the girls that work there about them... They apologized but nothing was done. Next time I'll get my food to go, got tired of swatting flies."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from New York and have been searching for a good West Indian restaurant to try and a quick search on yelp revealed this gem. The food is excellent! All the flavors of the Caribbean food we love and miss are in the food at this restaurant. The woman at the counter (maybe the owner?) was very friendly and helpfull and we were excited to hear she's from New York as well! :-) Give them a try...you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was my first time having Caribbean food, so I'm far from an expert, but it was delicious. I had the jerk chicken, my wife had curry chicken, and both were excellent. The sauce was great, the chicken super tender, the rice and beans were flavorful, and the fried plantains were to die for. The portions were huge too, I didn't quite finish mine my wife maybe ate half. 

There is limited parking, and its hardly a fancy experience, but if you want lots of good food and don't mind a hole in the wall with no frills, this is it."}
{"text":"The one and only Caribbean Cuisine! The BEST Caribbean food in all of Arizona. 
Being a Jamaican that loves his Caribbean food, finding this place was a blessing. 
As I'm eating my Curry Goat I'm transported back to my homeland with all the flavors and sounds that Caribbean Cuisine brings."}
{"text":"Only place you can get this kind of food on this side of the valley. Add to that it's owned by a woman from Trinidad and the head chef is Jamaican, and this is about as authentic as it gets outside of the West Indies."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm second generation American. My whole family is from Jamaica. So I know good Jamaican food. This is by far one of the best, if not the best Jamaican food spot in the valley! The curry goat is to die for. You know when you get off work and drive 30 mins that's it's good! This place is no where near my home but I always make the trip! I would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Yelp did it's job. Was in the area for lunch and saw the reviews so decided to give it a shot. Had the oxtail and it was just like I remember when visiting the islands. Very friendly and worth the small wait for individually crafted plates to ensure quality. Do yourself a favor and ask for the Caribbean hot sauce if you like hot...outstanding!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for awhile I love the food. Make to order the prize is better than other places. And you get alot of food for two days. Give it a five star"}
{"text":"Get the oxtail and doubles... This food is the real deal! Get the orange drink to finish the meal! Heaven!"}
{"text":"What an awesome jewel of the Caribbean in the heart of Glendale,  Az. .. please I'm inviting you to experience their flavorful food. . There's no boring at all.. great attitude and service from the all the staff. . They've great & delicious lunch specials, plus if you like you can enjoy your dinner entr√©es as well... thumbs up, guys!! LS"}
{"text":"Great roti with curried goat. Nice staff, Jamaican and Trinidadian. The jerk chicken was a little chewy and flavorless. It was in the evening, so i am not sure if it's normal. This was my first time and so I went on a recommendation from a friend. No restroom or hand washing area , a big thing for me. The plantains:fried and flavored well ."}
{"text":"I love going to this place!!! the food is yummy the price is decent, the music is part of the great ambiance, the smell from the kitchen is amazing!!! I pretty sure I'm one of the regulars...."}
{"text":"Amazing! I have traveled to Trinidad several times and lived there for a short period. This little gem of a restaurant was such a great find. Most Caribbean restaurants I've been to have very little, if any Trini food. So seeing pholouri, shrimp roti and even doubles! I was in heaven. My Hubble got the snapper. It was all SO delicious! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent Caribbean food. Some of the best I've had since relocating to AZ. I usually get the whole fried tilapia which is seasoned to perfection and the owner/cook is always so nice. Love this place! I highly recommend it to anyone looking for good authentic Caribbean food."}
{"text":"Best Caribbean food hands down! Tucked away in a small shopping center this place is definitely a hidden gem! The decor reminds me of the small shops located in Trinidad! It's always clean and I love how they represent my country on the wall! The owner is very nice and she always recommended Good dishes! Today I had the jerk chicken plate with a beef pattie!  The chicken was well seasoned and through jerk sauce has a kick! The peas and rice was excellent as well! Definitely will be coming back to try the salt fish next!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and have been looking for Caribbean cuisine for sometime and came across this place on Yelp. After reading some of the reviews and looking at the pictures of the food we had to go! The food was absolutely amazing and the staff was so nice!!!! The portions are out of this world. We had to take a lot of it to go. We had the Curry Goat and Ox Tails. All we could do was look at each other as we dug in. It was so good, all we wanted to do is go to sleep after wards. If that's not good I don't know what is! We will be back very soon!!! If you love Caribbean cuisine please try this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place literally brought me back to South ozone park NY, food was  amazing, beef patty,chicken patty Yummyyyyyyy,  I feel back at home, great hospitality from Addy super friendly , I also enjoy the music"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Unexpected taste of home, as I'm from
Trinidad living in West Texas with no Caribbean restaurants near me. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This Place is Great, just moved to town and I have been craving some good Jamaican/ Caribbean cuisine and I've definitely found it in this place! I will be going back for more. The portions are super big and the beef patties are on point. Try the Ox Tail As Well!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and came in for lunch. it smells good and I'm sure it is a good restaurant. the problem is... The cook said the person who takes the orders stepped out and wouldn't be back for 10 minutes. I only get a 30 minute break... pretty sad when I come to eat lunch and the person that is supposed to take my order is on lunch. LOL!!! So.... I get to leave without eating. Pretty sad actually. :(  I never had that experience before. I don't intend to ever have that happen again so guess I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place gets an extra star for offering Caribbean roti. I was so excited to get a roti in the U.S....until I saw the oxtail on the menu. :) The shop is run by a Trini. 

The food is generous in portion size. The roti is served on a plate next to a bowl of curry. (My fault - should have looked at the pictures before jumping in the car.) I was expecting the Caribbean rotis that look like square burritos, with the roti serving as a wrap for curried meat and potatoes. 

The music / karaoke system is loud.  Really loud."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and amazing food , the tilapia fillet is huge full of flavor and crispy and better yet super cheap. I have the jerk chicken and a order of the oxtail both full of flavor. I appreciate the food as well as the service I go there a lot since i loved here from California A MUST TRY if you haven't yet. FYI just go easy on the salsa they provide with the tilapia unless you really like spicy which I do cause it sure has a kick but delicious."}
{"text":"First time ever been there, the lady and man was extremely friendly. It was a nice, clean environment. I had the ox tail, it was very tender and moist. A bit on the spicy side. It was also a little greasy. But other then that I will be returning. Next time it's the curry goat!!"}
{"text":"Have to give it a 5!! Had the jerk chicken......Excellent!! The woman who served me even came out with a little ox tail for me to try....she got me hooked!! Definitely coming back for the whole meal."}
{"text":"This place is legit! Delicious jerk chicken and cabbage. One of our favorite places to take out. Just wish the plantains were a bit sweeter. Other than that, everything is amazing! And they are super nice, always lovely people. Good vibes and good food. Its like home!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious.. Oxtails & Jerk Chicken seasoned just right.  Red Snapper Stew ummmm ummmm good!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best place I've ever eaten in Phoenix!!!
Authentic Jamaican food. Vita Malt, Ting, plantains, reggae music and ridiculous food!!! Amazing service and selection. So so so so so good!"}
{"text":"If you need great Caribbean food that has flavor from the islands, look no further. I am lying when I say goood! It is the best out here. Friendly and great portions."}
{"text":"Loved the food, would have liked more oxtails but everything tasted good! Didn't have a log wait and the people were friendly"}
{"text":"This is a must Caribbean spot.. I love love love this place. From jersey originally and this is the closest to home. She never fails my taste buds each time.. num num num"}
{"text":"They have amazingly good Jamaican food. This is the real deal. This is a hole in the wall place in a seedy area, but the owner could not be sweeter. I hope she continues to get more business. This place is a real hidden gem. Especially in the west Valley where high quality non corporate chain food is hard to find."}
{"text":"When I tell you this food is on another level I mean it! The Customer service is out of this world they are super friendly towards customers. I'm in town for work for a few weeks and I went to try them out since the reviews were so good. Let me tell you the reviews don't do the place justice ! It's WAY better. I came back two days in a row and as I'm writing this review I even have three other orders in addition to mine and I'm headed back for MORE !! If you are in the area make it a priority to EAT HERE there's nothing bad on the menu something for everyone every time !!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was our maiden voyage to try Caribbean food. Thanks to our fellow Yelper's we tried this place out. We had Curry Chana( chick peas and potatoes),Curry Chicken entrees. Each dish comes with rice and peas(kidney beans) cabbage (they cook it and it's piping hot) and plantains. We also had a side order of Roti Skins . All of the dishes were very flavorful. My Chicken Curry and rice could have been a little hotter temperature wise. There was plenty of food for leftovers. 
The owner was very helpful in suggestions and accommodating our spice levels for each dish.
We ate in the restaurant but it's more of a take out place. IF you like loud reggae music your in luck. It was entertaining for the moment. 
I would definitely go back and try some different dishes and sides."}
{"text":"Unbelievable Jerk Chicken! Great spice, portions were fantastic!  Friendly, awesome service."}
{"text":"AZ is lacking true home cooked flavorful foods.  This place is clean, small, & new.  Owner& cook& server all in one is friendly, smiling, & warm each time I've gone now.  Food is authentic Trinidadian, great spice, freshness too.  I don't know how she can maintain this combination.  Not pretentious like some Jamaican joints in town.  Great place to try ox tail, goat, & bus up shot roti."}
{"text":"Fantastic a simple word for amazing place their food is on the money this is one place you really have to try you'll be missing out please believe me when I tell you this the flavors are very noticeable the sweetness in the food is amazing"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Caribbean stop so far. I will definitely come back. Might be tomorrow..."}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant twice and both times were great.  Addy who works there is very nice and seems very down to earth. My sole purpose of trying this particular restaurant was for the Caribbean style oxtails, which were plentiful and very much tasty the first time that I visited.  The second time I ordered the oxtails, the meat was not as plentiful as the first go round (which is why I took away a star) but it was still good.  I was able to give my dogs the luscious bones afterwards. However, they did allow me to taste their curried goat on my second visit and I was like, WOW!  I should have ordered that.  I will definitely be back and I will order the curried goat next time.  First time tasting goat and it was a good experience.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Tried a new dish their salt fish and vegetables.  A little on the salty side but it is salt fish . I would have liked it better if it was shredded in to smaller pieces with a little more oil and onions but that is how I remembered the dish from my childhood days.  The owners are friendly . We tried their sorrel. Which is a fruit drink . We did like  it always love their roti and curry chicken"}
{"text":"This is my favorite  carribean  restaurant.  Place  was pack6 on Saturday  night. We tried their Sorrell and peanut punch . The Sorrell is a little sweet , so is the peanut punch. There is too much ice  but it is so sweet  that after it melts it helps  to cut the sweetness.  We stated with  oxtail. It is very fatty but it is so good. We tried the curry goat and chichen both seem a little  runny ,there was not much has potatoes or chicken peas..I love their cabbage and red beans and rice. We tried their lowering.  This was bland I would not order a giant.  I love the roti skins  and their hot sauce. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Hello Miss Toni B, first of all none of the workers at Caribbean Cuisine have long grey hair, there is the chef and he has short  black hair, the owner has short redish hair which is always tied up. Maybe you are referring to another restaurant and put the wrong name, but please in the future if you are trying to give Caribbean Cuisine a bad review at least get your facts straight, and  get the right hair colors so it can look legitimate thank you ."}
{"text":"Say what you will about the valley's supposedly bland, predictable, chain-dominated culinary scene.  That may indeed be the consensus amongst the more sophisticated foodie types.  But if you use Yelp as much as I do & know how to find those rare diamonds in the rough, chances are that even your own hometown can surprise you.  Did you know Phoenix has restaurants that specialize in hard to find cuisines like Bosnian, Iranian, Scandinavian, Ukrainian, Malaysian, Australian, Ethiopian, Peruvian, Lithuanian, & even Nepalese?  If you're handy with a Yelp app & have an interest in food discoveries like me, chances are you already know the valley has lots of tricks up its sleeve.  Take Caribbean Cuisine, a place specializing in Jamaican (hard to find in of itself) & Trinidadian cuisines (even harder to find).  On my way home from work, I ventured here for an early dinner to satisfy my curiosity & my belly.

On the east side of 67th Avenue just a few blocks north of Bethany Home Road, you'll find Caribbean Cuisine nestled in the middle of a mini strip center of businesses.  Parking isn't ample & the restaurant itself is pretty small (seating for maybe 20 tops).  But once you walk inside, your ears perk up immediately as a makeshift stereo & speakers in the corner blast festive fast paced Reggae & other Caribbean music styles that surely would've had me dancing in the restaurant (if I'd had some liquid courage in advance that is).  Its a relatively simple operation here.  Step up to the counter & peruse the menu, then give them your order.  I believe the male owner is Jamaican while the female owner is Trinidadian.  Today the female owner was running the show (I think her name was Addy) and I asked her to give me some Trinidadian cuisine 101, to which she happily obliged.

The one item that apparently is as close to a national dish of Trinidad as it gets is Roti.  Roti itself is a relatively simple flatbread that originated in India, but in Trinidad it gets a unique twist.  Here at Caribbean Cuisine its served Dhalpuri style, stuffed with ground cumin, yellow split peas, garlic & pepper.  Its then cooked with oil & served almost like an oversized quesadilla.  While the Roti here is pretty solid on its own, its primarily used as an accompaniment.  And for my curry, the owner recommended I go with their Curried Goat.  A hearty stew filled with potatoes & tender chunks of goat meat with veggies & seasonings that create a deeply satisfying broth.  That Roti I talked about?  It's used to sop up the juices or can be used to hold those chunks of potatoes and meat.  Altogether its a complex assembly of different flavor profiles that works really well together.  The Roti portion was huge too.  I also got a side of fried plantains.  Came out to me still piping hot in aluminum foil with a slightly candied sweetness.  To wash it all down I was going to get a bottle of Solo (a Trinidadian soft drink concoction) but they were out.  So instead Addy recommended I try their homemade Mauby.  What is Mauby you ask?  Basically a drink made of tree bark extract (yes really) along with sugar and aniseed.  Its a tough drink to describe, but I would characterize it as having the flavor equivalent of a slightly bitter sweet tea that has almost aftertaste (if that makes any sense).  It was actually quite pleasant and easy to drink, just unusual.  Total cost for the drink, food & tax came to $17.

Ah, but we're not done yet!  Just when I was getting full, Addy had a surprise for me.  Out of nowhere she brought out a plate of Stewed Ox Tail over a bed of rice and black eye peas (and an extra plantain for good measure).  On the house!  Wowzers, thank you Addy.  I had told Addy earlier that I never had Ox Tail before & she was pretty clearly excited for me to try it.  And she was justified in her excitement.  While Ox Tails don't have a ton of meat on them, the meat on this was insanely tender & juicy.  Fell off the bone easily and those rice & peas were perfect for soaking up those juices.  I thanked Addy profusely for her hospitality, but now that I was explosively full I needed to go before she put more food in front of me.

I will echo one point of criticism from some of the other Yelp reviewers.  There were two items I had originally requested (a bottle of Solo as well as a side dish called Festival), but that they were out of.  Sounds like this is something that just happens here more than it should.  I came well before the dinner rush hour so I was confident they would be fully stocked for the evening, but not quite.  Thus why I can't quite give it a 5 star rating.  Aside from that, coming here was a really fun & enjoyable trip.  Off the beaten path both in terms of location and cuisine, but a comfortable hole in the wall spot with great music, a friendly owner, & great food.  And the valley is full of fun food discoveries just like this one.  All you need is an open mind, a sense of adventure, and a hungry tummy."}
{"text":"First time being here and I was wow away. The lady taking our order was just so nice and sweet and welcome us with a smile so to me that's a big deal. The food was fresh and hot, I loved it and as well as my brother and boyfriend. I would recommend this place to anyone who want to try Caribbean food, trust me you won't regret it. Thank you will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Yummy food!!! Addy rocks!! She is an excellent well trained chef!! The people here are amazing!! Beautiful people, and yummy food!!!"}
{"text":"Shabby hole in the wall place. Order from the counter, pick your beverage out of a chill box. Listen to dumb music, eat after you pick it up at the service window. Food was just decent. Fried plaintains were meh. It seems that as long as a restaurant in this area is cheap, it enjoys inflated ratings."}
{"text":"Ox tails were really great! Everything cooked to perfection. Great service!! I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Found this wonderful restaurant here on Yelp! It is a simple place with fantastic food!
There were things on the menu we had never eaten before!
Vivien had the Curry Goat entree and I had the Oxtail entree.
The entrees came with potato, plantain, slaw and rice.

We were obviously out of our element and were aided with tastes of the meats! They were all GREAT!"}
{"text":"I just recently experienced Caribbean food for the first time while I was in Tucson, AZ and loved it. So, I knew I needed to find a similar place in Phoenix, that way I could get my fix closer the home. As a result, I used Yelp and sought out Caribbean Cuisine restaurant. In my previous experience in Tucson, the restaurant I was at served combination plates with multiple entree meats plus sides. At Caribbean Cuisine, plates with multiple entree meats were not offered. However, I was accommodated when I requested a plate with Jerk Chicken and Oxtail with the standard sides. I was a little taken back when I saw that my total for my plate and a Jamaican pineapple soda came out to $18.01... But, I was far from disappointed: I received a HUGE plate of amazing food!

Both meats we're delicious, but, the Oxtail was especially savory. The cook did not skimp on the Oxtail meat like the other establishment in Tucson did. Anyone who's eaten oxtail before knows that there are a fair amount of bones in the dish. The amount of meat in Caribbean Cuisine's oxtail dish out-weighed the amount of bones 2 to 1! The meat was tender and, literally, fell off the bone! 

This was some of the best food I've ever eaten... Period. The service and friendliness of the staff was notable too. Ady, (I hope I spelled her name right lol) was especially friendly. 

I'll definitely be back, and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This Foodie Friday my friend and I decided on trying out Jamaican/Caribbean food. Finally something other than Asian. It was pretty good, not what I expected and I thought it'd be spicier but it was good. I liked that they let me sample a little before ordering. That was nice of them. Wasn't really sure what to expect taste wise but it smelled good walking in and the food was good and the people were nice. They have smokin' lunch deals. A hidden gem."}
{"text":"Never had food from Trinidad. Very good food. Everything was prepared fresh and it showed. Rice was amazing, I had the jerk chicken which was very good and the other folks I was with had the curry chicken, and the stewed chicken. Everything was great."}
{"text":"I'm from the East Coast and was in a deep depression from the lack of Caribbean food. I found a place to cure my Puerto Rican drought, but my hunger Jamaican food raged on. I came about this place after being detoured by a car accident. (If that's proper English) In Phoenix there are plenty of places that say Caribbean on the front and when you enter it's just another Mexican Carniceria. But, I took a chance and it was awesome. Like walking into a Jamaican joint in Baltimore. I felt at home. The lady at the counter was Trini, I believe. She was awesome. The food is amazing and abundant. I went back 3 times in less than 2 weeks."}
{"text":"This is exactly why I love family owned restaurants. The food here is so delicious and  taste very authentic like if you were on the islands. 

I'm vegetarian so I get the potato curry entr√©e. It is so big it's definitely enough for two people. I love it!!  they have other vegetarian entr√©es but this one is my favorite.

If you're in the mood for something authentic and delicious Caribbean food it's definitely worth the drive or if you live close by it's definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"This place is my jam!!  So far I have only tried the ox tail and the jerk chicken, but both dishes were fabulous!  The ox tail was melt in your mouth delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I do not think I left a scrap of meat or cartilage on the bones.  The jerk chicken was exceptional and was everything I was hoping for.  The sauce was tangy, smokey and had a bit of spice.  The chicken itself had a nice browning and was very moist.  The sides they serve are rice, fried plantain and a mixed steam vegetable.  I was honestly surprised at how well seasoned everything was.  The rice was fragrant with spices and the vegetables had just the right touch of salt.  
     I also tried the homemade ginger beer, and it was phenomenal.  Sweet and tart with a great ginger spice.  Nothing more refreshing then homemade ginger beer on a hot day!  
     I love this place and I cannot wait to go back again!  Beyond the delicious food, the staff are super nice and the atmosphere is relaxed and laid back.  If you're looking for some authentic Caribbean food, you NEED to hit this spot up."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, I must of went on the wrong day... a Wednesday afternoon. 

Mostly all of the pictures shows oxtails and curry goat which does look good. 

I ordered the Jerk Chicken which I order from Caribbean Marketplace and other locations at least 3 times a week and last week I decided to order from Caribbean Cuisine. It was by far one of the most terrible things I've ever ate. The jerk chicken was baked chicken with BBQ sauce on it, it may have had an untraceable amount of store bought jerk seasoning on it but it was soggy skin BBQ baked chicken, the cabbage was also one notch away from being undercooked. I had to go home and literally saute the cabbage to get it to be completely edible. It was a very bad food experience.

If there's ever a next time I'll probably try oxtails or curry goat like the other yelpers who went here."}
{"text":"The food: ordered curry goat and I have to say it does not meet the mark. Something is off ,  the spices are less and the meat quality didn't seem fresh. Also the vegetarian lo mein, no flavor. 

The price: $3.50 for a soda?!? Are you serious? 

No AC: I believe the AC only works in the kitchen but not in dining area. They have tried to put fans around but we all were sweating. 

Overall: very nice owners but food quality needs some more lovin."}
{"text":"Best Jerk Chicken I've had since moving to Phoenix.  This place cooks with authentic ingredients, not the sauces you can buy at your local grocery.  The portions are good and the food has been excellent the 2 times I've been."}
{"text":"A gem of Glendale is here!

This is a very small and NOT Fancy but clean Caribbean Bistro with only 5 tables and no restroom. You order at the counter, seat yourself and wait a CARIBBEAN MINUTE for your food. That means 20-40 minutes depending on what you order. 

All the food we tried was delicious!

Last time I had the snapper and it was fresh and so delicious. This time I had the Chicken Curry. It was flavorful and stewed to perfection and was just falling off the bone tender. I was offered hot sauce and it appeared to be home made and was MIGHTY HOT! My platter came with a large amount of rice that was studded with beans that went well with the melty tender chicken curry. I also had some fresh braised cabbage and fried plantains.

My husband wanted to order the oxtails but they weren't ready yet so he went with the Jerk Chicken. I tasted a piece of it and thought it was spicy, delicious and also was very moist. I liked all the flavors in it. 

The people there were very nice and friendly. They checked on us often and offered us some extra fried plantains.

A specialty of the house is cow foot's soup. They also offer goat dishes too.

This little place from the desert brings the Caribbean to you!"}
{"text":"We had Ox tail & Jerk chicken. It was delicious. Great flavors, good size portions, & friendly staff."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and the food is wonderful. Every dish I've tried has been great. It's run by a husband and wife and they make everything fresh. I highly recommend this place. The lady behind the counter is always very nice and pleasant."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, perfect amount of spice. But the real MVP is the owner, that runs the register, and cooks. She is kind, welcoming, and most importantly running her business, and cooking her food, HER way. I will spread the word, for people to go an support her and this delicious food!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found this spot.  Great family owned restaurant. We were greeted with a friendly smiles and given samples to try.  Not only was the service friendly, but also fast.  We enjoyed the oxtails and jerk chicken meals that include beans/rice, cabbage and potato.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with a friend.  I had the Chicken Curry with Roti, beans and rice and cabbage. WOW! I am excited about going back. I grew up with best friend from  Port of Spain T&T.  It was like childhood again. I loved eating at their house and now I can find all of those things  right here in Glendale. To add to the experience, the atmosphere is so inviting. Much to be said when you feel welcomed and not rushed to leave.  I sat with my friend for a few hours just hanging out drinking carrot juice and talking. Owners are just the most friendly, warm people EVER.  They definitely have nailed the flavors and the customer service. I can only see great things in the future for this restaurant. I know I will be a constant customer."}
{"text":"This place deserves more stars than five. The fish and fries lunch special was so good (and cheap)! The fish was perfectly fried, moist on the inside. The fries were perfectly seasoned. The meal reminded me of my grandmother and her love for fried fish. The patties were delicious (veggie and chicken), and the ginger beer homemade was the perfect balance of sweet and refreshing. Everything is made as you order and the two staff were extremely nice. Can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"great place with excellent food and even better people!!  Feels like eating at a family member's house. Food is incredible as well. Prices are Very good. I'm making it a weekly spot to go eat. Good to find a place with authentic Caribbean food made by great people. Music took me back home!!"}
{"text":"This place hasn't been open too long, and we've already gone twice! I personally like their curry chicken with roti, and their doubles. It's authentic Caribbean food and I hope you guys support them so they stay open because there aren't many good Caribbean food places in AZ. I think they have room for improvement in the speed of the service though. Orders take a while to come out, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they are new. Hopefully they get the swing of things and get faster. If they do, I'll definitely give them 5 stars later on. :)"}
{"text":"Touch down in AZ. Switch off that darn airplane mode. Fire up the Yelp app. Search criteria: Trinidadian food. Found it...boom!! Happily scroll though the photos while salivating slightly and praying that doubles is not a weekend thing only. Thank God the traffic wasn't too hectic so I made it there to meet these beautiful food angels. 

A very friendly Trini mom and her cute daughter filled me in on the available menu items. Alas, no doubles til Saturday but there were LOTS of food options for my choosing. I decided on a chicken roti and I asked for potatoes and channa (chickpeas) to be added. I also got a side of kuchela and a side of plantains. There's a saying in Trinidad - \"your eye bigger than your belly\". That was the case on all levels with me! 

With some sweet reggae tunes in the background and my plates in front of me, I was in heaven. The food was good...oh so good. The plantains were fried just right to the point of that caramel crispy goodness. Flavor on the curry was on point - good ole madras curry...It wasn't spicy so I'm glad I got that kuchela. The dhalpuri could have been a tad softer but no biggie. That was the BIGGEST roti I have ever seen! I took a break and went in again but lawdy...as far as Man vs Food, Food won! I wish I was here until the weekend but next time, I'll know where to come!"}
{"text":"So I'm in Phoenix for work and I'm looking for somewhere to eat and I stumble across this God sent restaurant! This is some of the best Caribbean food I've had in years. Big up to the owners of this restaurant they really are amazing! Oh and you must try the curry goat!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Delicious food. Definitely will be back. I recommend the oxtail and doubles!"}
{"text":"I came for the jerk chicken and I left extremely satisfied!! Im new to Arizona so this was my first time here but I will definitely be back again and again! My husband loved the seafood plate too!! Well done!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing.  They give you so much that you cannot eat it all.  I ate some of it and this is what I had left to take home.  I cannot wait to visit AZ so I can eat there again. I will be back.  I had oxtails and sides.  It was on point."}
{"text":"Sooo good! Got the ox tail meal. Staff is friendly. Small place but so delicious! Prices are great too!"}
{"text":"Coming from New York, I am accustomed to having authentic food from different cultures at my fingertips. Having left NYC, I've learned that I can't expect that luxury anywhere else.

Currently we're in Tucson but are moving to Phoenix in July. My husband is from Trinidad & Tobago and back home in NYC, his mother made sure that I knew it! She got me hooked on Trini food in a \"New York minute\". I've had homemade roti skins and curry, my husband has an unnatural addiction to currant rolls, and sorrel is his drink of course year-round. But something about Caribbean Cuisine's food just didn't do it.

I ordered some curry chicken that came with channa and potatoes, which I had to get with some buss-up-shot (paratha roti) because they didn't have dhalpuri (which is my skin of choice all the time). My husband prefers buss-up-shot so I let him be the judge of that one. It was \"eh, ok\". The curry was drowned in oil and wasn't the best. It wasn't so bad that I wouldn't eat it but it wasn't too great that I would want it again and there was so few potatoes and channa with my meal that it didn't feel complete. My husband order some pholouriei, sorrel, and even bought a banana Solo. He couldn't finish the pholouriei and neither one of us enjoyed the sorrel. We're not quite sure that it was sorrel because it didn't taste strong enough. On top of that, his banana solo was flat. At the tip of this iceberg, he couldn't get any currant rolls. She doesn't make them frequently. She noted that now that she's getting more trini people coming in, she's going to start making them again.

Service was nice. We got there maybe an hour after they opened so it took a little bit for the food to be ready. We got it to go because we had to head back down to Tucson. I really enjoyed all the flags that were hanging. It prompted a conversation between my husband and I about people we knew and accents we'd heard. While waiting, we noticed the chaos of their drink fridge; different drinks tossed everywhere. The guy was trying to organize it but it was sad to watch.

Ultimately, I knew it wasn't going to be the same but I had high hopes it would be better. I'm not sure yet that I'd go back but I'm all for second chances."}
{"text":"Everyone knows I love this place.  Caribbean food is what I grow up on.  This place is so damn good. 

Ada is such a kindred spirit.  When I call to place an order she's right on it. She knows exactly what I want every time I call.....

Yes, I do travel for food.. lol...and this place is no exception. 

Give this place a try and I'm telling you...you wouldn't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot in the West valley! The food is delicious! Portions are quite generous- had plenty for two meals! It's a small little hole in the wall spot, but you leave feeling full and happy!"}
{"text":"the food is good had the curry goat an chicken  to be real honest the goat  rice an bean or they say peas but bean are good the chicken to be on the up an up sauce look like bar b q sauce but was jerk sauce an very hot great not fake the chicken on the other hand was dry i had two legs an a thigh was dry an seen as it was not just cook more like reheat in microwave but they do have sitting ,the music was play with the daughter djing reggae music  great size portion big the for is trinidad style   honest will i go back to the place yes will i eat in the place yes  nice for a man to meet someone first time  are the price's worth the food yes  two dinners with two drinks came to 37.80  ginger beer jamaican style yes they have homemade an bottle  order oak tails dinner very big portion or curry goat was great wonderful sauce  here the deal driving is in a small strip mall very very small in there for a few then getting packed the close at 8 pm this was a tuesday o yea they did have a fly problem but guess due to the door opening closing"}
{"text":"I know this review is a little late but I've been so busy and I'm really behind on my reviews. I went here with a group of about 5-6 and found the food to be pretty good. I ordered the jerk chicken plate and although it had a bite (as it is supposed to) it wasn't too spicy. The fried plantains were just right in my opinion. Not too sweet or soft and mushy. The rice was okay but nothing to write home about. Hubby had the stewed chicken and it actually was spicier then the jerk chicken which I found surprising. The meat pie was a little dry and could have used a little more filling for my tastes. It is just a storefront and not anything fancy with a few tables inside. But don't be put off by the ambience - the people were very friendly and the food was pretty good. I'd go again if ever in the neighborhood and in the mood for Caribbean food."}
{"text":"Absolutely out of this world amazing food! Colorful, delicious, full of veggies and awesome meats like goat, shrimp, tilapia oxtail and red snapper! 

The whole fried tilapia was the best thing I've possibly ever eaten. Ever. Perfectly spiced and fried to total crispness so it falls apart and is finger lickin good! The best part is cleaning out the head and eye meat. It is served with wedges of lime, a bomb tartar sauce unlike any I have ever tried and a delightfully spicy (med to hot heat) but flavorful and sweet mango salsa that is nice and thick- not chunky!

Served with rice and beans, and sweet fried plantains; I was MOST satisfied with this clearly authentic meal! Thank you, much gratitude!!"}
{"text":"Carribean Cuisine was recommended by a good friend from Trinidad. I've tried several other Carribean restaurants across the state, including Tucson. Carribean Cuisine is a leader by far! The food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Being a New Yorker I come to love the taste of Caribbean food but I really liked a lot then take the flavors that Caribbean restaurants can create from scratch the first time I went to this location it was really good but the problem I have is consistency I recently went in and paid extra and the amount of food received was still the same plate I always get even though I paid more 1 plate and 2 meat pies with a soda came out to almost $30 not sure why. I hope they work on consistency is the first time I came it was really good I didn't have to pay extra and it was quality the oxtails were big and flavorful this time they were small and underseasoned."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch and tried some beef patties and the fried fish special. Bought some friends who haven't tried trini/Jamaican food style foods. They enjoyed it and many things I wanted to get are not available until Saturday. I completely understand being a NYORKER some dishes are for Saturday. Enjoyed also being able to stick it too my son who expressed I wouldn't be able to get West Indian food in Arizona. Enjoyed talking with owners and told them I will be back for my roti, doubles and oxtails."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 star because the food was amazing .......... we ordered curry chicken and jerk chicken and patties .... the patties were too spicy for us but I felt like I was in the irelands. I would advise call in and order to pick up if you're not gonna eat in the restaurant. As the wait is long ..... but def worth the wait!!!!! I can't wait to try more food here...,. 
I'm glad I have found my spot for Caribbean food ....."}
{"text":"Hot dang the food was off the chain...been craving rotti skeptical at first....Got to location felt like reg East coast trinny restaurant regge music playing serviced was fantastic.......new Fav"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Definitely make sure to order a double on a Saturday! I go with the oxtail and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"We came to visit this Trinidadian restaurant and walked away with an incredibly delicious experience. Upon arrival, the wonderful aroma of food and spices was coming through the entrance to underscore my immediate impression. The humble interior consisted an open kitchen, a TV, wall-to-wall artifacts of the Caribbean islands, and tables stacked along the walls with a sizable couch in the back. The chef quickly greeted us from the open kitchen with a nod and smile. The restaurant had just opened and she was getting the kitchen ready for the day. 

The Stewed Oxtail ($12.95) was served with fried plantain, cabbage, potato, and rice and peas. The stew was robust and flavorful, and especially addictive when mixed with the rice and peas. The oxtail was tender, not boney, with multiplicities of flavors nicely embedded. The cabbage added textures and a bright element to this dish, and the rice and peas brought the flavors together with depths of sharp garlic, onions, coconut milk, and large kidney beans.

The Goat Curry ($12.95) came with fried plantain, cabbage, potato, and rice and peas. The curry was equally flavorful, but the goat was lean and turned out slightly dry. I still enjoyed this dish immensely, but thought the goat could be better. The plantain was thick cut and not greasy. It lacked the crispy edges, but I still find the tender starchy consistency a nice element to accompany the sweet aroma.

Their homemade drinks, Mauby ($3.50) and Ginger Beer ($3.50) were excellent. The Mauby was an acquired taste, so it might not be for everyone. The flavor encompassed a sweet root beer flavor, followed by a metallic bitter finish. Additionally, the Ginger Beer had a sharp, but not overpowering sweet ginger flavor. It was refreshing and added a wonderful contrast to the meal. I highly recommend the Ginger Beer. 

As one of the true, hard to find holes in the wall restaurants, the home-like atmosphere, down to earth service, and excitable menu make this a viable option for small groups and family gatherings. The restaurant could get a bit smoky inside, but the smell quickly dissipated once I left the restaurant. Moreover, the food could take some time to come out, so interested diners should take that into consideration when making a visit. I also thought the prices were high, but they do have a lunch special and the dishes were humongous and the food was both plentiful and flavorful. They were out of Roti that day, but I hope to return to try their Curry Shrimp Roti, Cow Foot Soup, and Ackee and Salt Fish."}
{"text":"From a real Trini this maybe the best Caribbean food I have had outside of New York or my own home Trinidad and Tobago. I would recommend anyone who loves good food, the staff is wonderful and the vibe is very West Indian and nice. I am glad to have found a home."}
{"text":"To start, the food was incredible. My date and I ordered the jerk chicken and a beef patty. Every last bite was eaten and enjoyed.

The food was priced very well and definitely lead to an experience that made me want to come back again. 

In addition to the food being delicious all of the staff was super attentive and friendly. The woman who I believe to own the restaurant saw us finishing the food and went in the back to get more FREE food to try. She offered us shrimp to try and it was just as delicious as the other food we had just finished. 

I would recommend this place to anyone, even Caribbean first timers would easily be able to find a meal they enjoy here and feel very welcomed."}
{"text":"Good food made like you are in your aunt's kitchen, if she happens to be a really good cook.
very cozy, nothing is cheap these days but it's not bad. The oxtail was good."}
{"text":"Fun Friendly and GREAT FOOD!! I had ackee and Salt fish, jerk chicken and curry goat amazing maybe I order too much but it was worth it. It was worth the drive."}
{"text":"1st time here today. Food is so authentic and delish! Had a beef party, oxtail and curry goat plate. So much food had to take some home. Loved  the reggae that was playing. They ran out of roti and coco bread so I'll have to come back soon!"}
{"text":"You will not find a better caribbean place than this in the valley. Very friendly staff. They cook the food with love and take great pride in their end product. I always leave with a full belly and a big smile."}
{"text":"This place is the best Jamaican food I have taste since I moved here from Florida  great vibes the people are very nice  and welcomeing great. Island music as well if you want good  island food try this place out"}
{"text":"The food here is good. However, I recently visited here, spent little under $50. My goat curry was great but then I found a long grey hair in my rice. Soooo gross!! Threw that out but continued with the curry and dhal puri. I got 5 dhal puri because I love that shit. Next day having one just like that with some tea when I biyr into it a long black hair. Grossed out again. Twice for one order that's ridiculous. I was planning on coming back here for Soup this weekend but I'll pass. Thank you, no thank you. I would suggest wrapping up your hair when preparing foods. So disappointed because I drove out of my way to come here that day smh. P.s I'm tempted to go in the trash and send a photo with this post but ain't no body have time for that. Just watch when you eat!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed...I'm always in there...get good food, a little lime with friends, and sweet music"}
{"text":"I love this place.  We love West Indian food and  was recommended this place by a Trinidadian.  We have been to both Jamaica and Trinidad so we had a gauge to measure by.  The food was great, the lady who owes it was so friendly to us and wanted our family to have a good experience.  There was reggae playing in the background, very clean and just friendly, not to mention the food was so good. It's fresh and made from scratch.  I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"Review based off two different visits. I've had the plantains, chicken stew, beef patty and Jamaica. The plantains were overcooked and greasy. The beef patties were delicious. The chicken stew was great as was the Jamaica (both very flavorful). The place was clean and the staff was friendly. As far as quickness...make sure you have some time. They are scheduled to open at 11 am, and both times I went it was well past 1130 am and they had just opened up and needed to wait for the grill and grease to heat up."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Chandler just to find they are closed on Sunday. Please correct your hours on Yelp and post on your door! 

Came back on Monday, omg, food is amazing!"}
{"text":"This spot is excellent! Like everything was delicious! Had the ox tails, OMG so much food. Y'all can cut back I won't be mad."}
{"text":"I love this place! I just wish the parking was better here. Totally not the restaurants fault though!"}
{"text":"great food, great service, great portions, and great prices.

wasn't sure what to order and we were offered a couple samples. ended up with the stewed oxtail (excellent) and the curry shrimp which had perfectly cooked shrimp. the stewed chicken I sampled was also excellent, very flavorful, tender, and juicy.

this place is a little outside of my area, but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I make a trip to Arizona about once a year and I make sure I eat here while I am here!  The fish and chips is great with the rice and beans instead of fries! I talk about it all year when I am gone about how I wish I had this place where I am from!"}
{"text":"First timer from Michigan and man it was awesome! Looking forward to trying everything on the menu! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Wow. We where at Westgate for the Final 4 and only wanted to see top rated restaurants and thank God this showed up

After three days of Bdubs and Whiskey Rose at West Gate we finally made our way to this restaurant near by for what would be the best meal of our stay

Do yourself a favor and try the Ox Tails, they are great!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, so glad I tried this place, will definitely be going back, oxtails and curry goat, spot on... so tender, fall of the bone, and so flavorful"}
{"text":"Second time eating here and it gets better everytime . Red snapper is the way to go. Great people and good food . Cannot go wrong there."}
{"text":"Small restaurant tucked in a strip mall. Very clean and cherelrful lady who is server. Cook. And dishwasher. I ventured for the jerk chickken and it was great. The chicken had marinated in a fantastic jerk sauce and cooked to moist perfection. It was served over fluffy rice with red beans, some grilled peppers, onions and cabbage. The fried plantains were the perfect compliment to this home cooled meal. I highly recommend you try this place. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place with authentic Caribbean style food, this is it! My husband and I just tried it for the first time and will definitely be coming back. I tried the stew chicken and he had the curry chicken. Both meals came with a heaping portion of rice, vegetables, and plantains (my favorite). The chicken was cooked to perfection, tender and juicy. Prices are very reasonable especially considering the large portions of food. The music and atmosphere make the experience complete. Hospitality was great, I forgot to catch the name of the woman working the front but she was very friendly and kind. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Every single thing was amazing. Whole fried tilapia was my favorite. Super yummy great prices. WOW... Good job"}
{"text":"Please update your times drove 30min on Sunday got here at 5pm says you close at 6pm Sunday on yelp very disappointed"}
{"text":"Had a craving for jerk chicken and decided to give this place a try based on Yelp reviews. I got there and couldn't decide b/t the ox tails and the jerk chicken so I ordered both..at worse I'd have leftovers for tomorrow.

The atmosphere was friendly everyone greeted me upon entering and I would consider the place a great little hole in the wall to grab a bite on a hot day and relax.

My oxtails were just OK, I feel like they could have been better, not as flavorful as I was expecting but they were tender. I ordered JERK chicken because that is what I had an initial taste for, imagine my disappointment when I got home and realized they gave me CURRY chicken instead. I knew I wasn't going to leave back out to head back over that way to get my order corrected so I simply settled for that. The chicken was moist and very tender it just wasn't what I ordered. The rice and peas were as expected.

Make sure you double check your food before leaving to avoid my dilemma. Not the worst place, but I wouldn't be in a rush to go back either. Most of the meal items are $9.95 and the side items range from $2.00/$2.95."}
{"text":"Owner Addy is very friendly & service is attentive...Unfortunately Trinidadian food is not done justice here..The beef roti I had to go didnt taste good at all, the goat was fine but nothing impressive. The roti bread was not baked well & beef was uneatable..Disappointed by the lack of Trini flavor & will try again hoping for better food next visit."}
{"text":"I am a teacher in the Glendale area and I usually pack my lunch for reasons of time saving and saving money. Who can afford to eat out every day, right? Well...I am so thankful I forgot to pack my lunch today. Very happy!!
This little place is just north of the corner of 67th and Bethany Home in a non-descript little shopping mall. Once inside I was greeted by a friendly young woman and I noticed that the inside was clean and decorated with the many flags of the Caribbean.   I had learned about this place after being on my Yelp app a few weeks ago. I am also happy I remembered where the restaurant was. 
I am a 100% vegetarian and I am always looking tasty and unique ways to eat my veggies! I ordered the chana and potatoes which is a a stew of curried chick peas and potatoes. I had the rice and beans on the side along with sauteed cabbage and plantains. i took it to go and went back to my classroom to eat my lunch. I have to say that I am a lover of caribbean food as well as a lover of Indian food as well. Number one, the portion of food she gave me was HUGE!! Number two, the food was FANTASTIC!! The chick peas and potatoes were tender and mildly spiced.  The sauteed cabbage was fantastic, a little salty and very tender. The plantains were tender and cooked perfectly. The portion of rice and beans was huge and they tasted very good. The rice was tender and not over cooked and the beans were just done enough. I have to admit I finished 95% of it because it was so good and I did not want to stop eating it. 
If you want great caribbean food in a clean and not fancy atmosphere, this is the place to try! I know that I will be back and I would love to take my wife there for dinner some time. It honestly was really good! Check out this hidden jewel and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is great, first time I went I took some friends with me. We were not at all disappointed with any of are dishes. The woman working there who I believe to be the mother was very kind and sweet. She kicked in a bowl of oxtail to try. I've been back several times with different friends and they love this place as well. A definite must try!!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite area, but I'll make the trip once a week for it. Mmm the oxtail & curry goat is yummy!"}
{"text":"Jerk Chicken! Not for the faint-hearted. I ordered over the phone after reading some of the good reviews on different sites. Jerk Chicken plate for myself and Oxtail plate for my hubs. We also got sides of Aloo pies, plantains, doubles and Pholorie. Had to get the Solo sodas! We missed trini food from when we used to live in Queens New York, this def made up for it! The lady was so nice she threw in a double with pepper on the house for us to try! Everything was delish, we even had left overs for the next day. My 1 year old went to town on aloo pie. The fam loved it! Definitely coming back to this place again. 
This may be a small hole in the wall place, but the food is #amaze!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's me..my experience was dry food loaded with dry rice and beans and little tasteless meat...with several different dishes....i will try them again before ruling them out ..."}
{"text":"DOUBLES IN PHOENIX! What?!? My friends and family in Jamaica Queens, NY turned me on to doubles. I've been craving it ever since! Then I just moved to Glendale and I was looking for Indian food in my area when this place popped up. And now I have a doubles shop 10 minutes from my place! Doubles? BOMB. Goat Curry? BOMB! I'm still in utter disbelief that I'm having doubles right now in the desert of Phoenix. Thank you, look forward to trying new items and telling all friends about this place!"}
{"text":"Listen I'm a Caribbean food snob since I was born and raised in the Caribbean and let me tell you this place doesn't get anymore authentic than my moms or grand aunts home cooking ! Please go and check it out it's delicious,filling and inexpensive! Quality at its best.Only place in Az with good non generic Caribbean food!"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix on business and had a taste for jamaican food. I decided  to try Caribbean Cuisine restaurant in Glendale, I'm glad I did! I absolutely  loved the curry chicken dish, it was what I've  been craving for and it hit the spot. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Best island food here in the west valley! Glad I found this hidden jewel... The curry goat and ox tails are soooooo good! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some Trinidadian food and thought I'd give this place a try after learning that the owners are from Trinidad but sadly I was disappointed.  Read on for more....

Location & Aesthetics - Located in Phoenix or rather in Glendale as Yelp would list the address; however if you're using a GPS as I did to find the place and use the Phoenix address as was printed on their business card (previously given to me), you will be directed to a residential area.  You must use the Glendale one listed, and you will know that you've found the right place when you near Bethany Road and the U-Haul depot. 
Parking can be hit or miss as they share the parking lot area with other business so I can envision the area becoming full.  If that's the case, then unfortunately there's no other place to park as the street is busy and one cannot park there.  Thankfully there was a tattoo parlor that closed which opens some parking spots.  

Menu - Situated below the order counter and is self-explanatory.  

Service - The staff was nice, friendly, warm, and welcoming.  Any questions we had was answered promptly despite not having any except for the occasional question asking if certain Trinidadian foods was available, e.g., if 'Buss-up-Shut (paratha roti) or 'Sada' roti was available?

Food - I ordered the curry chicken with channa and a side of 'Buss-up-Shut' (paratha roti).  The wife ordered the same except she had regular roti (sada roti).  We were hoping to order some Trinidad soda called 'Solo' but was disappointed to see that the restaurant didn't carry this (-1).
While we waited, we were given a complimentary bowl of pholourie (fried batter shaped into balls) with some dip which was supposedly was tamarind but didn't taste like it.  Sadly the pholourie wasn't large and fluffy, wasn't well seasoned as expected, and tasted very bland as well as the dip which, if it was tamarind, would've tasted tangy and sweet but definitely didn't.  
When the meals came, we discovered the plates was very small and as such the food was overflowing from the plate after being piled high on it (-1 for inappropriate sized plates).
The channa and chicken tasted okay - both well cooked however the accompanying curry in which these items swam in was very bland and didn't at all taste anything like the curry from Trinidad which by the way, the country does make its own brand.
While we ate the meals, we were provided with a complimentary plate with a 'Doubles' - two bara (fried flat bread) with channa.  The bara tasted tasteless with no seasoning and one could surmise that only flour and water was used to make the bara.  The channa was okay although the plate was heavily seasoned with pepper and sadly we couldn't take another bite of the 'Doubles'. (-1 for the food)

I definitely wouldn't be back here based on how poorly the food tasted as it wasn't anything like what Trinidadian food tastes like."}
{"text":"First time here and it was just wonderful. Everyone at the restaurant was kind and the food was extremely fresh. I had the Chana and potato entree, which was delicious. We will definitely be back -not only because it was great service and food but also because we'll be craving the food again soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Jerk chicken with rice and peas, cabbage and plantain. Everything was really good and the customer service was also good. This review is based on a pick up,not dine in service. I see some reviews which are not so great which pertain more to their Trinidadian food. Their Jamaican food from my experience and years of eating Jamaican food is great. I will definitely be making another trip here in the near future."}
{"text":"Literally a hole in the wall, but the service was out of sight. Terrific atmosphere, cozy, great music and when you walk in the door it instantly smells amazing. We were offered tastes of the oxtail and goat curry, both were delicious! I also had some of the chicken curry which was falling off the bone delicious! If you're into authentic Caribbean cuisine I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely loves it every single time that I have been here.  I don't live by but it's definitely worth the drive"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place and finally had the time.  It was worth the wait. Curried goat roti was really good. During my visit there was jerk chicken on the grill.. I know what I will have next."}
{"text":"Great food, super tasty!! Will eat here whenever I'm craving oxtail. Had nice reggae music playing when I walked in."}
{"text":"So I went here last night. And It was phenomenal. The lady and her son were so friendly and down to earth. It was me and my two home boys one from Trinidad and the other from Dominique and it reminded them of home. We got curry goat, curry chicken, ox tails, extra plantains, pholorie and rum cake. The food was fresh a d hot. They made us feel like we were family. I'm from California but I will definitely come here every time I come back to Arizona. 
This place is a must try for everyone! !!"}
{"text":"Hard to say if the food or hospitality comes first. Although will definitely have my kids stop in on way to my house when ever I can."}
{"text":"Let me begin with this its is a spot on replica of a trini food spot, good spicy curry along with some of the caribbean's specialty sweet drinks,  parking is tough  to be honest but still would recommend .."}
{"text":"The hospitality, the food, the music, the smell, everything about Caribbean Cuisine had us feeling like we were right in Trinidad! We wanted to taste everything on the menu but our tummy's were way to happy and full after eating the doubles, curry goat with rice and beans, curry shrimp and roti.

{"text":"Wow...what a find. The atmosphere, the service, the music, and the food. Transported to Trinidad. Had a couple Red Stripes while waiting for our food and smelling the incredible aromas wafting from the kitchen. The owner is a gem and such a sweet lady. The goat curry was amazing. It was so tender and flavorful and not even a twinge of \"gaminess\" which befalls many a curry. Not too many potatoes either...good balance of potato to meat. The goat was NOT a bit dry this time, but that is hard to get perfect each time, so with the flavorful, spicy, oniony, creamy gravy they make, and proper prep of the goat to take away the gamey taste, I won't care. The heat level wasn't quite up to par for me, but I eat fire, so the sweet lady brought me some homemade scotch bonnet sauce. Oh my...that was so yummy...and sooooo hot! Such a good blend of the peppers with citrus and garlic. Perfect with the curry. The rice and peas were seasoned and cooked just right and stood on their own but melted into the curry perfectly. The cabbage was a nice touch, but was kind of bland. Went well with everything else. The plantains were overcooked, but still tasty with carmelization, so I can't dock them for that. I needed a couple bites to cool my homemade sauce fire. The oxtail was very tender and delicious as well. These were ginormous portions, so we stuffed ourselves and still took a whole meal home! Bonus! I tried their homemade ginger beer and it was so good. Lots of ginger, not cloudy, and not overly sweet. Next time, I'm taking it home without ice to add lime, pineapple and some spirits to make my version of an island punch that I can't get out of my mind. I will update my review once I've gone back for the roti, doubles, and coconut bread. And...more goat curry."}
{"text":"This place is amazing Trinidadian food. Everything on the menu here is worth it!  It is kind of tucked away off of 67th Ave and is a bit hard to spot, but it is next to a convenient store.  Parking here is really hard to find since it is VERY limited.  The jerk chicken, ox tail stew, and the coco bread with patty is some of the few key items to try out.  Been meaning to take some pictures of the food, but never get the opportunity since I forget about pictures and start devouring it."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I have ever eaten. The owner is very nice and accommodating. Just try it, the food will speak for itself"}
