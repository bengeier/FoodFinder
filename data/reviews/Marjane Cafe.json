{"text":"We had a great meal for friends catered by Marjane Cafe--vegetable couscous, marinated chicken skewers, and wonderful pancakes. We ordered from the menu they sent to us and then when we received the price it was higher than what was posted on the menu--turns out the menu  was from 2013 and they honoured those prices. Great food and plenty of it. Our family must have eaten for three days. We're looking forward to going to the restaurant for a meal."}
{"text":"Now I know where to get inspiration if I ever needed Moroccan theme Decor.  The Furniture, Tea Pots and Tagines are part of the environment(for sale too).  It's a good thing there's no Moroccan Dessert Heat for sale here as we were already overcooked from the Toronto weather.

It's almost like a Turnkey operation as the semi-Kitchen is pretty much right behind the counter similar in scale and equipment as a Starbucks.  The Gentleman(+0.5 *star*) working there was absolutely great with HOSPITALITY as if you're a guest at his home rather than a customer.

Chicken Lemon Tajine with Frittata ($12.95)

Now understand, I don't have too much Tagine experience under my belt however I have had one that exceeded my imagination of the cuisine.  That's probably why I felt underwhelmed by the non-Tagine'd Chicken Lemon Tajine.  I was expecting sauciness and bread to soak.  I believe the price is slightly high for what this dish offers.

Chicken Pastilla with Couscous Salad ($8.99)

Pastilla, Bastilla.  Toemato, Tomaato.  It's another one of those dishes I fell was unique and happy to discover somewhere else.  This version was slightly smaller and would be nice if it was warmed slightly more.    The Coucous Salad seemed overly sour from vinegar which depends on individual taste I guess, since Amy Pataki found it stand-out worthy."}

Marjane Cafe is more than a Moroccan cafe. Aside from food and drinks, it also a Moroccan home deco and furniture store.

There is no official opening hours for Marjane Cafe... no where in the front of the stores or online. The sole owner, cashier, food server just opens whenever there are customers?! But on weekend he keeps the cafe opens till past midnight. 

Moroccan Mint Tea ($5) served in a large tea pot with just a taste of honey was quite good, wish there are more minty though! The little puppet like tea pot handle cover was just so too cute!! I couldn't stop playing with it!

For food.. we just asked the owner to serve us whatever he recommended...so we ended up having: 

Chicken Lemon Tajine with Frittata ($12.95) 
My Yelp friend was served this chicken thigh..maybe he knows that he is a leg person and he was looking for belly dancer?? The potato frittata was a little too heavy for me... but he finished everything... I guess it was not Ok? But he finishes everything usually... 

Chicken Pastilla with Couscous Salad ($8.99) 
I love my Chicken Pastilla which is really savoury with taste of both sweetness and saltiness. I love the mixture of almond, pistachio and powder sugar! Couscous Salad with a nice cumin dressing was refreshing for a hot summer day! 

Marjane Cafe is also a Hookah Bar if you are into Shisha... I wish they have some day beds so I can enjoy a shisha/sipping mint tea while lounging around!"}
