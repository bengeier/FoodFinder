{"text":"Sat at a table for 40 minutes. After 15 they took our drink and appetizer order.  After 40 minutes our food never arrived. We left. Skip this place. It wasn't even crowded. Way under staffed and staff they do have is under trained. Disappointing because the menu looks promising."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Lakewood! Went on a Wednesday and the staff even moved our table out of the sun to make sure the environment was perfect. Steamed bun appetizers were so delicious (Kung pao was amazing!) got several sushi items and the beer menu was extensive, manager even came out to explain rolling beer menu. A must visit location in Lakewood!!!!"}
{"text":"I got here at 5:00 p.m. On a week night for happy hour. I ordered a ginger margarita with huge chunks of candied ginger in it it. I also ordered shrimp buns, pork buns and pad Thai. The pork was waaaaay too salty. And the shrimp was ok. Tons of lettuce served with them. The drink and the portions were huge, so I had to take the pad Thai home. Most disgusting pad Thai I've ever had! Cabbage and soybeans don't taste good in pad thai in my opinion. There are a million other names for noodle dishes, why call it pad Thai if it has absolutely no resemblance to it other than \" noodles\". Candied ginger and lettuce was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"I've gone to Roxu only two times now but I went only about a week after the first time because my girlfriend and I loved it so much. We were planning on going to Barrio but found it was much to crowded and loud to enjoy. We then went next door to Roxu where it wasn't as crowded with a few people at the bar watching the Cav vs Golden state (Cleveland 4 lyfe)

To start the only person running at the time, Other than I assume the cooks, was one guy who later introduced himself as the manager/a co-owner. He was an ecstatic guy who was very excited to show us all the neat features of the restaurant. INCLUDING A TABLE YOU COULD WRITE ON WITH CHALK. Now I know what some of you may be thinking, \"a writable table? that sounds like it's for kids\" excuse you no It's awesome and was fun to do while we waited for the food. Also the environment is nice and subtle with a few fun things like a large fish bowl, fish included, and projecters projecting different images, mostly of Asian sort of village/housing. We were later told that they are working on a system where they will change over time, very cool. 

He started with offering us drinks from their drink menu, which I believe to be fairly reasonably priced however I stuck w/ water Obviously nothing went wrong there. We then went to order, he was very helpful in describing meals and answering questions along with suggest to me the pulled pork-steam bun. Let me tell you I was not disappointed with the steam bun AT ALL. The texture and flavor of the bun itself is very good and the pulled pork flavor was bursting but bun itself helped take some of the blow, my girlfriend enjoyed them as well. My girlfriend ordered the chicken dumplings which she would describe every time she mentions the place as \"SOOOOOOO GOOOD\" I thought it was pretty good myself. 

The manager/our waiter was very attentive, although I suppose there wasn't much else to attend to, I appreciate it anyway and I have gotten waiters who, while none else is there, will just skimp you in the past. 

The second time we went we went during a time where there was more people there and still was not disappointed , our waiter seemed a little awkward, perhaps new and unsure, but none the less we were waited on fairly and the food was not a disappointment. I had ordered the chicken and waffle and while I wasn't exactly feeling it myself I didn't come off to me as \"bad\" or \"gross\" or \"poorly made\" and just didn't seem to fit my taste, but was still well presented and good enough to eat. My girlfriend this time got the vegan pho which again she enjoyed very much and I found was pretty good too. The manager/our last waiter saw us and greeted us asking how the meal went and we talked for a minute about how things were going with the place. He told us the projectors would be finished being adjusted and also something about Netflix being put up as well. I'm very excited to go to see how it turns out. As it turns out after seeing us he had the waiter take a few dollars off of our bill for us! I feel bad that I can't recall his name but he is very kind and friendly and I hope to get to know him a tad better through my many future visits to this establishment. Eat your heart out Barrio."}
{"text":"Do not order via UberEATS.  Roxu is blatantly ignorant when you order nigiri and sashimi.  They will give you the cheapest possible cuts of tuna for nigiri and such thin cuts of sashimi that you cannot even identify them without tasting.  

First time ordering from them...also the last time.  We were so hopeful, especially since my wife is a Tokyo native, to have a sushi restaurant so close.  But they nose dived to the bottom with the rest of them just due to their ignorant service."}
{"text":"Emily our bartender and server was the best, food was also delicious, I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Went to Roxu tonight; 7/21/16.
Likes:  
Food - really really good
Service - really really good
Atmosphere - nice, comfy, open

Dislikes:
No happy hour pricing on \"dining\" side - just doesn't make sense to me
Soda refills - they charge for refills of fountain drinks - wtf $2.00

Will I go back?  Absolutely but will Sit in \"lounge\" side and will not order soda"}
{"text":"Very mediocre.   Had a Groupon but \"surprise, surprise\" it only permitted selections from a special menu, with 2 cocktail choices.   Groupon really needs to crack down on these bait and switch offers.  

The food was fair and the various meats included tasted old/reheated with the exception of the pork belly.  Ramen had good flavor, but again, the meat had and \"old\" aftertaste.   The fried rice with waygu beef was nothing special.   Meat,again, tasted reheated/old.  

Server was ok.   Was not an expert on the menu and wasn't able to answer questions consistently about ingredients or preparation.  

The atmosphere was pleasant but at 6 pm on a Saturday night, there were,maybe, 10 people there.   

People will come when the food, service and value are good."}
{"text":"Sushi night was an epic failure on every level. The sushi was fishy, mushy and chewy all at the same time (horrifying). What was particularly alarming about the experience, even more so than the empty restaurant on \"sushi night\", was the spicy tuna roll that looked like it was made weeks in advance by a chef who clearly had no proper sushi preparation experience. We stopped eating after a few pieces in hopes of avoiding what seemed to be imminent food poisoning. Low quality ingredients paired with poor execution. Even the hot Saki we ordered was served luke warm. Bottom line, I would have rather taken my chances at chipotle at the height of the ecoli outbreak."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for a date with my wife. We ordered drinks, apps, and entree right away. Received our drinks after 10 minutes and after 45, still had NO FOOD. Everyone else seemed to be waiting a long time as well. The bad reviews seem warranted by our experience tonight. Waitress was nice and very apologetic but the kitchen must be a mess. Who knows what the food is like."}
{"text":"OH my god what a wonderful place. I loved the food. It was amazing and tasty. The drinks were simply the best. We had the Ginger Margarita and loved them. Then the best was last, the banana bread pudding. Oh lord, a party in your mouth.  Great Food + Great Service + Great Drinks =  Return Visits."}
{"text":"I went to Roxu yesterday for the first time and was impressed. I got the Tofu Pad Thai and enjoyed it, as well as a sake flight which is a neat idea. Hayley the waitress was pleasant and helpful. The owner also stopped at my table a few times and as other reviews have noted, he's very enthusiastic about his restaurant!

As a vegan, I was very happy to discover that Roxu can make a vegan version of most of their non-vegan items. Although they currently don't have vegan desserts, they told me yesterday that's in process. When the owner heard I was vegan, he mentioned that he actually had some vegan ice cream in the freezer and got me a big serving. A random occurrence, but much appreciated!

Roxu also has a green certification, meaning they're environmentally friendly. Unlike lots of other restaurants, they don't use styrofoam for to-go boxes and instead provide recyclable ones. The owner seemed passionate about that aspect of the restaurant, and I give him major kudos for that.

The anime on the bar's TV was a fun touch.

All around, great experience and I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai tasted like chicken noodle soup. Sushi was falling apart. The crab tasted like canned tuna. Every single type of sushi had the same sauce on top, Sriracha  mayo. 

Highlights 
-cocktails
-edamame 

Contours 
-service (slow and numerous mistakes)
-sushi (tiger and Hollywood) 
-Pad Thai 
-Expensive


Save your money. If you want sushi, go to Whole Foods."}
{"text":"We ordered sashimi,nigiri,rolls and wagyu bibimbap with Ãœber eats.

First of all, it was only tuna from this menu \"Nigiri( 3 pcs ) tuna, salmon, flying fish roe\". Who thinks only tuna coming?
Also, \"Sashimi ( 5 pcs ) tuna, salmon, eel \". Who thinks only one fish coming?
It was no choice to choose which fish we wanted. We thought all of them included.
Finally, their terrible service!!!!! We called them and talked about nigiri and sashimi. He said \"   \".

Nigiri and sashimi both taste nothing. I'm so disappointed...!!
It was my first time, I think it was my last time also.
If you like sushi, don't get them here."}
{"text":"Atmosphere...meh .  Food...pretty good.  Had a Groupon and have been wanting to try this place out.  We split three different steam buns- Kung Pal(which was very good), short rib which was the star! And Philly which I could have skipped!! Beer list was good, but out of date, taps were out of order but the beer choices were still good.overall we would go back again.  The bartender shane was excellent! He was very friendly. Attentive and upbeat."}
{"text":"I would definitely go back to this place. It started off a little shaky when my boyfriend and I split the Salmon & Tuna deconstructed maki. It was hard to eat, esp without a knife, and the flavors weren't for our liking. But then he got the pork fried rice with the ponzu sauce and absolutely loved it. I got the seasame chicken pierogis and they were delicious. The sauce was to die for. And they gave us a 10% off coupon for happy hour. So that's a plus. Service was great, and the 2nd half of our meal totally redeemed the firsr half."}
{"text":"I'd have given this place five stars based on our first time there a few months ago, but our experience last night - or lack there of - leaves me giving it two. I had made reservations for a party of four through open table. When we arrived at the restaurant, I told the hostess of our reservation, and she apparently had no record of the reservation, asked us how many people, then sat us at a table, giving us three menus, saying she'd be back with the fourth menu - which never happened. We were given water, but in the span of 15 minutes, no one came to refill the water, or take drink orders, or food orders. Nothing. The place wasn't packed. There were empty tables around us. I counted three different servers who continually passed us by without offering any service. All of us at the table were looking for service. Nothing. I shouldn't have to flag down a server in a half empty restaurant. I was extremely disappointed and embarrassed to have taken our friends to a place where we were ignored. A place where I was excited for them to try the excellent steam buns and sushi we'd had before. Needless to say, we got up and left. Too bad. My husband is forgiving enough to say we'll give them another chance in a month or two - me, not so much."}
{"text":"What a great place! The ambiance is fantastic. Our meals were incredible and the service was amazing! What else could you ask for? Really cool menu items that are extremely unique. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Service was good, but there wasn't anything - from the drink, appetizer, and meal - that I enjoyed or cared to eat again.

The ginger margarita had no detectable ginger flavor and simply tasted like strong, cheap tequila. The pork belly steam buns had dry buns and even drier, overcooked pork. My pork belly ramen had a minuscule amount of noodles (that were not traditional ramen noodles, though we were told they were), the same dry pork my buns had, mushrooms that could have come from a can, and a weird, very thick, peppery(?) broth that didn't pair well with the ingredients. I probably ended up wasting 2/3 of it :["}
{"text":"Food was excellent! We started with the deconstructed maki roll & that was by far my favorite part of the meal. It was everything inside sushi. Amazing! My husband really enjoyed his salmon & the shrimp bowl was delicious. We also fought over the last piece of the untraditional cheesecake. Highly recommend. Great wait staff. Jamie was a doll!"}
{"text":"Great food & drinks! Happy hour has good deals. The hostess that greeted us at the door, I believe her name was Miranda, was adorable and welcoming. Thoroughly enjoyed my experience and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The vegan steam buns are sooooo good. I got the vegan pho as a main dish, it was OK. The bar tender was incredibly nice, the ginger margaritas a good, and I really wanna try some of the other interesting looking cocktails. Next time I'm gonna try the green tea martini."}
{"text":"One and done here.  Every dish we ordered was super salty, to the point of being almost inedible

The chicken fried rice looked good, but bite after bite was overwhelmed by the salt content.  The lettuce wraps had a lovely presentation and I usually enjoy a make-you-own wrap style of food, but the meat was difficult to eat given its salty nature.  My wife's beef slider was tasty (and had a good sauce on it) and the side salad had a refreshing dressing that was slightly tangy.

Overall though, hard to get past the issues we had with the seasoning."}
{"text":"Roxu was a let down. I think I'm done with asian fusion for a while as my expectations seem to be totally out of whack for what the reality seems to be. I'll check out Roxu again in 6 months as maybe my experience is attributed to the restaurant's recent opening and growing pains. I think they have good ideas, but the execution isn't quite there.

The tuna steam buns had little flavor, although the tuna itself was good. there was a little splotch of green sriracha on the plate, but it wasn't enough to use for buns. The buns themselves were soft and pillow-y. 

As far as sushi goes, the only items on the menu were 3 deconstructed maki rolls. My friend and I ordered two rolls to share. We figured we'd try those, and order something else later as needed because we didn't know how big/small they'd be. We ordered the spicy tuna and hollywood. each deconstructed roll was served on a small wooden serving board. They looked beautiful, but were difficult to eat regardless of whether using a fork or chopsticks. It was hard to taste all of the ingredients together at one time as you could only get a bit of this and a bit of that. You couldn't cut into the deconstructed roll with a knife because the board was small, and the stuff on top would fall off. Half of the stuff fell onto the table. It looked like a 2 year old ate at our table. The hollywood was the best of the two. but again, it was hard to get one complete bite. Half the time I was eating just rice and spicy mayo, or snow crab and cucumber or avocado foam. My friends and I usually order a bunch of sushi rolls and share everything, so maybe that's where we went wrong in trying to share it. 

We ordered cocktails from the drink menu, and they were good. Too much fresh lavender on the drinks as every sip left a bunch stuck on my lips, in addition to the lavender I drank. Beer, wine and sake too. Happy hour until 6, including specific menu items, but there was just one happy hour cocktail (ginger margarita) in addition to beer/wine/sake during happy hour. It'd be nice to be able to try some of the regular menu drinks at happy hour as they're $10 a pop. 

Service was attentive. Our waiter seemed like he was on fast forward, but was friendly and knowledgeable. 2 other members of the staff also stopped by our table in to see how things were."}
{"text":"This was out first time. We loved the food.. The pork belly steam buns were to die for.  The chicken confit was also really good and had a little kick.  Service was great... As we were waiting for our main course we got a call that out youngest son was being rushed to the hospital.  Immediately we asked for our bill. Overhearing our phone call.. The waiter told us to go... don't worry about the bill... We threw money on the table and left.

A real class operation!!"}
{"text":"I've walked by this store front many a time and was a little thrown by the decor. The black table clothes with their bright white napkins led me to believe this was a high price special occasion sort of joint. I was very much mistaken. This place is great. While the decor could use a little warming up the food and drink is delicious. With a variety of happy menu items and customizable cocktails this is a great spot. 

I had the chicken Kung pao steam buns and they were delicious. The accompanying side slaw was stellar bonus! I tried some of my friend fried rice and my was it tasty and more than enough to share. Their cashew brittle made it quite the different dish and they did not skimp on the chicken. The steam buns were flavorful and had just enough kick for this gal!

The staff is super friendly and helpful and happy to lend a dinner or drink recommendation. 

Defiantly five this place a try!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place but I can't. 
My sushi was very bland and my husbands food was dry. All the food lacked anything to make it stand out or make you want to come back. The steam buns reminded me of day old bland pancakes that just fell apart when you moved them.
The room we were seated in was absolutely freezing cold. You literally pinpoint where all the drafts were coming from. 
I only gave it 2 stars because I enjoyed our server."}
{"text":"Went here with my sister a few days ago. We got steamed buns for appetizers. I believe we had Kung Pao steamed buns. They were small but quite tasty. It was also happy hours me them much cheaper. Yelp check in at this time saved me 10% on the dinner. We had ramen and chicken and dumplings for our entrees. Full of great flavors."}
{"text":"I tried this place when it first opened a year ago. We had a sit down dinner and it was awful. My tuna poke was literally still frozen. A year later I figured I would give it another try through Uber eats hoping they worked out their previous issues. This experience was worse. First, the order of 3 sushi rolls took 45 mins. When the Uber eats driver arrived she had been given the wrong order to give to me. It wasn't even close to correct. When I called roxu they seemed very confused about my order and I agreed to just go pick it up myself. I wish I had stopped at little ceasars on the way home because this sushi was down right inedible. It was soggy, bland, terrible raw fish, and they didn't even provide us with ginger or soy sauce. The bartender was rude when I came to pick up the order as well. I will never eat at this place again."}
{"text":"Went to Roxu on Wednesday night (7/26) with four in our group. Started with the steam buns (vegan, philly, Kung Pao Chicken) and ginger margaritas (tea for me), all quite tasty. Picked our entrees from the Noodle Bowl list: Pad thai, Pho, and Jasmine with Tofu. Have been here three times now and never disappointed with the eclectic fusion food or service. Our server Alyssa was personable, knowledgable, and kept checking back all thru our meal to refill beverages/water and get anything else we needed.

So glad we have this unique restaurant in the Lakewood 'hood!"}
{"text":"Mediocre is the word. When they first opened they were so so. But now that it's been over a year hasn't gotten any better. The steam buns always have tough meat, cheap quality. The price isn't reflective of portion or quality. Not sure what the point of \"deconstructed sushi\" is. It's difficult to eat...just pointless really. The drinks are ok but take forever to get to the table. Not impressed for a Lakewood area place."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now. The first time was right after they opened for their late-night happy hour. Things here across the board were very hit or miss. The philly, pork belly, and short rib steam buns were all disappointing but the kung pao chicken was okay. The pork belly ramen was actually delicious but the best part of any ramen is the broth, and this had maybe three spoonfuls of broth - it was almost more of just a sauce. The cocktails are really strange here too - they have way too many \"trendy\" ingredients that just don't work well together. Overall, my impression of the food and drink is that the prices for the happy hour specials were reasonable but their full price menu items are way overpriced for what you get. Service was also strangely inconsistent - the server just completely ignored me when it came time to ask for drink orders, but took orders from the rest of my companions. I had to flag her down later and ask to order a drink.

Or second visit was tonight, also for late nite happy hour. I was hoping they had ironed out the opening night glitches we experienced when we went the last time, but not so much. I tried the mu shu duck (tasty) and shrimp (completely bland) steam buns. Bizarrely, the same issue happened to me with our server this time - not sure if it was the same person or not but once again I was completely skipped when taking drink orders. I wasn't buried in my phone or anything either, just chatting with my companions. After that happened, I opted not to bother with a drink this time.

Overall I like the concept, but the execution is just really not there. If you navigate the menu skillfully and pick the couple of good options available during happy hour it's probably worth it. Otherwise, unless they find a way to work out those kinks, I would pass."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I only have bad things to say. Starting with the lime gin fizz I had, it was all really poor. My friend got the steamed buns and deconstructed tuna maki. The tuna was served cold, not meaning raw, meaning very cold temperature which was a turn off because sushi grade tuna should be served at room temperature in a restaurant. It was also chopped? Or maybe it went through a meat grinder? Whatever the case, the consistency of the tuna was gross. She said that her shrimp in the steamed bun was hard. Her rice was also over cooked in the maki. I got fried rice. I didnt think you could mess up fried rice but it is very possible. They have different spice levels you can get choose from, so I asked our waitress if the Korean hot hot was really HOT and she said no. I have a pretty high tolerance for heat so I got the \"hot hot\". The hot hot was bbq sauce smeared all over fried rice. She told me that it is intended to be a spicy bbq sauce. Had I known that, spicy or not, I would never want bbq sauce on my fried rice. We both usually suck it up and eat our food, but I really didn't want to eat my food for the sake of eating it. For fried rice and the drink it was $20 of untouched food and drink. She comped my friend's meal but said she couldn't comp 2 even though only two bites were taken.  She offered us a dessert but no one had eaten dinner... We walked straight to barrio. Their manager walked past us twice and never stopped over, I thought that was a bit odd for a place that just opened or a restaurant in general to not have superior customer service."}
{"text":"Great food and service on Valentine's Day. We did not have anything like the negative experience in some of the other reviews. The buns, especially braised short rib, were super tasty. We even got a free dessert for the holiday."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food is very hit and miss. The service was great both times.

Hit:
Pork Belly steam buns
WonTon pierogies
Spicy chili Margarita

Miss:
Chicken fried rice (Salty!!!)
Sesame chicken pierogies (bland)
Waygu steam buns (where was the meat?)"}
{"text":"As I had a craving for sushi, I stopped in for sushi night Wednesday. I started with the ginger margarita. It was not a good drink. I am in the camp that a margarita should but pleasantly tart and not sweet. There's was 10-12 oz wine glass of slightly fruity, extremely sour liquid. No ginger flavor was detectable.

The sushi was worse. The spicy tuna roll was a small sliver of plain tuna, cucumber matchsticks, and rather large pieces of green onion. Not at all spicy and rather roughly constructed. The volcano roll was a California roll of mostly cucumber with a little crab and avocado, and drizzled with spicy mayo. The worst part was the rice - it was either old and/or under-cooked. It was below day old grocery store sushi quality, and at $7 each very disappointing. 

My friend got the steam buns. She managed to eat most of one but that was a challenge. It came with some yellow, funky-smelling cabbage (yes, I know cabbage can have a certain smell, and no, it wasn't kim-chi or pickled). Neither of us dared to taste it.

The atmosphere and service were fine, I guess. Nothing particularly interesting or annoying. The place was almost empty, which doesn't surprise me after trying the food. I can't see returning. 1.5 stars."}
{"text":"Happy hour offers a good value and the food was tasty. Nice service and staff with very little wait time. Had sushi and steamed buns and would get both again."}
{"text":"Tried out Roxu for the 1st time last night, With my husband and 2 friends. Was really excited to try it out because I love this type of food!
The menu & drink options all sounded delicious!
We were seated by the owner who seemed nice and our server came over right away and got our drink orders.
It took almost 40min to get our drinks,  while waiting for our drinks a server tried to give us another persons drink.

We orders apps at 40 min in and they took awhile to come. While waiting for apps a server tried to give us another tables Apps! When we got ours the apps were pretty good. We had the miso soup, edamame and deconstructed spicy tuna roll and a kung pow chicken steam bun.

We then ordered our dinners which also took a long time.
We ordered a steak medium and it came out well, well done and Potatoes were overcooked!
We ordered scallops, 3 small ones came on a plate with rice and both were over cooked!
We ordered pork ramen bowl, it was nothing to write home about but not the worst thing on the table.
I ordered a ahi tuna over veggies. It was actually pretty good! I think it was because they didn't have to really cook it!
We were told we would be comped for our drinks and we complained about some of the food (at this point we were there for 2 hours and not trying to wait for it to be fixed or \"comped\") our bills came out and they were not itemized so I don't know what I actually paid for. While paying or bill a server came over with more food and offered it to our table! Not making this stuff up! It then became hilarious!
The bar was off and slow!
The kitchen was off and slow!
The service was off, slow, not really attentive and confusing!
I gave 2 stars because its a new place and maybe this was their first busy turning tables night and not all of the food was horrible! This place could be great! 
I won't be back anytime soon, maybe months from now when the staff know what they are doing I'll give it a try again.
P.s
We called in a reservation to Humble while we were waiting for our bill so we could have drinks and my friends could actually eat food! 
2 dinners in 1 night! Thanks for making our night memorable!"}
{"text":"There are some things to like here, but so far they have a lot of kinks to work out before they can really turn this into the restaurant that I think they are trying to be.

First the good.  

The steam buns.  The bun was fluffy and had the slight chewiness that I really like.  I had the wagyu strip bun, and would definitely order this again.

Udon bowl.  The broth was delicate, complemented the udon noodles very well.  The wagyu beef that came with my order seemed as though I was accidentally given gristle.  I ended up eating around the fatty/rubbery part and what meat I was able to eat was tender and rich in the beef flavor I expected.

Now for the not-so-good.  I don't want to call it bad, because it wasn't horrible, but they were small annoyances.

Atmosphere.  It is LOUD.  I mean REALLY loud for the space.  The acoustics are so bad that you can literally hear the conversation from 2 tables over as if they were sitting at your table.  There is also a lack of anything on the walls.  I don't know if it is because they have only been open for a few weeks, but the design of the interior was so bland you could mistake that you were sitting in an office cafeteria.  There is a lack of the space being \"vibrant\" like some of the other well known \"Asian Fusion\" style restaurants in Cleveland - like Voodoo Tuna and Noodlecat. 

Service.  While our server was polite and did his best to answer any questions we may have had, it was starting to become annoying that he would check in on us every few minutes.  It was so much so that he even apologized, and said that the management requires the wait staff to do it.

Price.  This will be a huge issue in regards to getting repeat customers.  For the occasional diner it may not be a deal breaker, but restaurants can only survive on establishing a healthy following of repeat customers.  Being two doors down from Barrio may also hurt their business, because well...it's Barrio.

So, overall, there is a lot of promise here, but they are still learning how to crawl when they should have just hit the ground running."}
{"text":"Hoping to make this a frequent dinner location . The food is creative and satisfying .  We have dined here twice and left full and happy . The Kobe steak fried rice and the cocktails are on point .  The steam buns are worth trying too.  If you are on a budget and reside in Lakewood they have an excellent all day happy hour on Mondays with good deals on food ."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night around 8:15, restaurant was half full.  Decor and layout are nice.  Menu was alright, some interesting options.  We ordered drinks, a duck wing appetizer, and entrees.  The duck came out and was presented well, sauce was good, but way too much and being sweet, it overpowered the duck which was unfortunate.  Entrees finally came around 9:30.... For fried rice and a soup entree.. A hour later.. The fried rice tasted like a bagged Asian dish from Sam's club, and the soup tasted like a Philly cheese steak over not fully cooked broth and a watery broth with no flavor.   Server never checked back to see how food was or to update during the 30+ minutes that passed from when we finished our appetizer to when our entrees arrived.  I could not recommend this place less."}
{"text":"Loved the food. The staff was so friendly and knowledgeable. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"The first time I ate here I wasn't sure about it, since there were areas of improvement. However, we have gone back multiple time, including a to-go order on Friday, and have been quite pleased! The owner has such passion and is truly dedicated to making every person happy. 

These are seriously the best steamed buns in the area!! 

Some highlights:
Solid happy hour (and late night happy hour!)
Serve food Til 2am most nights 
They will make it very spicy if you ask!
Wednesday sushi night is solid 

Only downsides:
A little high on the pricing but I forgive since everything is made in-house 
Sometimes the pork in the ramen is a little fatty 

Pro tip: always order extra broth if you like more of a hot soup dish."}
{"text":"Tried Roxu with a few friends for dinner recently and found it to be pretty good. I will start with the best and work may way down from there.

The cocktails were stiff and tasty. I fail to remember the names of my cocktails, but one was a flavored mojito and the other was a spicy mule of some sort. Both were very good. In particular, the mojito was correctly balanced which I rarely find. The spicy mule was really spicy and maybe a bit on the peppery side but still enjoyable. My friends tried the create your own Hurricane (the type of drink you create changes by season, according to our lovely waitress) and they said they were fantastic. There was also a decent beer list.

The food was mixed depending on which dish I tasted. I personally had the Chicken and Dumpling Bowl, which was ok but lacked much flavor. The steam buns were all fabulous. And we tried the Green Tea Machi which is less of a dessert and more of a \"palate cleanser\" according to one of my friends. It's was not super sweet, just cold and icy and sort of like a chewy lightly sweet ice milk. 

The ambiance and decor was simple. Honestly, I don't remember what it looked like...simple, bright, and white? 

I will definitely try it again. It had some interesting choices on the menu and the happy hour looks fantastic. And I am always in the prowl for a hot new happy hour option."}
{"text":"I can't give this place enough credit, everything here is wonderful. The food the drinks the staff. It's clean the food is priced well and I love their all day Monday happy hours. If you're looking for something different from your normal boring food routine then go here. It's worth it and they even have parking. I know what you're thinking, parking in lakewood?! Yep parking in Lakewood. Lol 


Also, Phil really knows his stuff."}
{"text":"Great steamed buns and excellent happy hour specials. The host was very accommodating as well. Great little restaurant."}
{"text":"I felt like eating light so I decided on the Ebi steam bun and the Moo Shu Duck from the small plate menu. The steam bun was perfect as were the accompanying vegetables. 
The server was most helpful by taking the initiative and bringing some hoisin sauce though it was not on the menu for my moo shu duck. It was perfect.The scallion pancakes made the perfect vehicle for the awesome combination of duck, kimchee, cashew/sesame crumble, and hoisin.
I believe this is a must try."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first because of a couple of bad reviews.  Maybe they did have some kinks to work out when they first opened, but they must have worked all those out because our drinks and meals were PERFECT!  It was our first time here and we ordered off the happy hour menu.  We got the blood orange, chili, and lychee margaritas!  EXCELLENT and only five dollars each, what a deal!  We ordered the shrimp bun, the tofu bun, and the mushroom bun.  All $3-4, which we thought was a great deal anyway, then we received two of each, which was the best deal I've ever seen!  The buns were also delicious!  We also got tofu fried rice and the beet salad, again excellent!  Also the service was polite and efficient!  We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Food was really surprisingly good. Service was friendly and excellent..will definitely be back. Flavors were amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered the Hollywood \"deconstructed\" maki.
While it tasted good it was really
Hard to eat and I would have much preferred it to be in a traditional roll"}
{"text":"#HotSteamyBuns It almost sells itself, right?

I don't get into the whole \"Asian fusion\" thing all that much. It's not that I don't dig Asian food, I just find myself spending my calorie budget on more Euro-centric cuisine. I'm a schnitzel and gerkensalat guy, what can I say? So when the other half scored a Groupon for a pair of steam buns and a drinks at this here joint in Lakewood, it gave me an excuse to step outside of my comfort zone for just a little while.

The place has a pretty minimalist feel to it. Black and grey tables with chalkboard tops (and plenty of chalk nubs for doodling), a small bar in the front, local art on the walls. The high ceilings and big windows up front give the main dining room a nice airy and open feel to it. Great for snapping pictures, too. We arrived sometime around 5:30 on a Wednesday and we were the first customers. We eat with the \"earlybird special\" crowd and we like it that way. We were shown to a table by the front windows. Perfect. Others have complained that it's loud. Maybe later and on the weekends, but we'll never know.

In a nutshell, it's about Asian comfort food here, all done up with a slightly new-world, local bistro spin. Rice bowls loaded with fresh veggies, tender meat, and more umami than any person should shove in their face alongside familiar dishes with names like Pad Thai, Kung Pao and Ramen. They've got sushi, fried rice and interesting items like Wagyu Bibimbap, Short Ribs Gyudon, and Moo Shu duck. Everything's described in detail to help with your selection if you're not all that versed in the Asian vernacular and everything sounds yummy.

Oh yeah, and steam buns. You've gotta get some steam buns. These sticky, white, cloud-like, conveyances are stuffed with all sorts of tasty goodies and they're delicious. You get a pair of them for around $8 served with a side of sweet/sour cabbage slaw. The menu reads as a treatise on Asian classics. Be forewarned, everything we had (except the dessert) had some level of heat. If you're sensitive to this ask your server before you order anything.

On the drinks side of things, don't come here expecting to be blown away by a huge beer menu. Roxu is an Asian fusion restaurant, not an American gastropub. That being said, they do have four draught selections and a well-organized bottle list that I'm sure even the snobbiest of beer snobs will find adequate. Their beer prices are also a pleasant surprise, with most coming in around $5. Of course they've got sake, wine and cocktails if that's your thing. I remember seeing a sake flight on the menu for $9. I've never had sake, so maybe on my next visit I'll give it a go. My wife had some kind of specialty drink that was purple, had blackberries and blueberries in it and a sprig of mint. I don't recall what it was, but she enjoyed it.

The service we received during our visit was very good. Our server was helpful, although I could have done without the \"let me rest my chin on your table while I talk with you\" interaction. Why do servers feel the need to kneel down like that? Just makes me feel strange. Like I'm giving my order to a 6 year old. Anyway, he did a good job. Kept our waters filled, checked in often, all the usual good server behavior. He didn't really offer much info after we told him it was our first time, but not a huge deal. The important thing in this review is really the food. So...

Kung Pao Steam Bun - A little bight of heaven on a plate. Perfect level of heat, the cashew brittle is pure genius.

Grass-Fed Beef Steam Bun - Tender, moist unctuousness. The hint of smoke from the onions and the drippy crema. Asian-inspired drunk food.

Sticky Duck Wings - Get these. Slathered in a sticky, sweet, sour glaze you'll be lapping off the plate, they pack a punch. The meaty drumsticks are perfect for sharing.

Short Ribs Guydon Bowl - A rice bowl with balls. Tender strips of melt-in-your-mouth short rib, freshly sliced mild and slightly sweet shoshito peppers, and that house-made dashi. An umami bomb.

Apple Donut Bread Pudding - They had us at donut. A trio of ridiculously delicious bread pudding bites served with whipped cream, blueberries, vanilla ice cream and caramel drizzle. I expected more apples, but damn. Just damn.

I was pretty blown away by the food we had here at Roxu. It's rare that I take a bite and immediately know I'm in for an experience. Everything we had was immensely flavorful, incredibly fresh and prepared with a level of detail that's rare in restaurants at their price point. If you've got a typically dumbed down American palate it just might be too much for you. One bight of a Kung Pao steam bun and your head'll probably explode Jet style. Not to worry, though, Roxu is approachable, too. They've got dishes that'll gently lead you into their world along with dishes for the more initiated. Sure, I could have nit-picked my way down to a 4-star rating, but even I'm not that much of an asshole."}
{"text":"Just what this neighborhood needed! Chill atmosphere, dark, minimal. The music is a little off (5 year old indie/alt/electronic). I always get something vegetarian, not on the menu (or a slight variation of something that is on the menu) - they are super accommodating even though there aren't a ton of explicit veggie options. Sticky buns are not what I expected but were fab. Decent Asian beer selection, interesting Asian inspired cocktails. Bar tender is great. Tofu is probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I think my problem with this place is that I had VERY high hopes for it. Unfortunately I was left a bit disappointed. The menu is relatively small, and for the quality and amount of food, relatively expensive. The decor is very modern and beautiful, and the service isn't too bad (our waitress was a bit OVERLY friendly, not a problem for me, but possibly for others?) 


Anyways, in short:

Too expensive. 
Too small of a menu. 
Beautiful interior. 
Nice service."}
{"text":"Stopped by hoping for dinner but the lights were so bright in the restaurant we decided to go else where. I'm guessing they're confused about the difference between dinner and diner. Will try them for lunch next time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to head here on a whim on a Monday night and we were so happy we did. First off, we sat down to find that the tabletops are chalkboard! You can draw on the tables! That was enough to make me happy to be there. Maybe I'm simple... but I was highly impressed. Anyway, we really didn't have any idea what to expect food-wise but I went ahead and ordered a chicken and dumpling noodle bowl (thanks to very friendly and helpful server's recommendation) and he got one of the steam buns. I was imagining more of a pho type of deal, and this was not (less broth, heavier on the stuff) -- but it was delicious and flavorful and the dumplings were cooked perfectly. I don't regret a thing. I tried a bit of a steam bun and that was good too, the meat was seasoned really nice, with a doughy texture to the bun. Our server convinced us to try this hand-shaken blackberry-something iced tea and that was delicious too, and I normally can't stand sweetened teas. We ended with bread budding and house made ice cream which was awesome as well. What a fun place! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hit and miss. The first time I went the food was great. The second time I went it was okay. The duck had bones in it and the food was kind of cold. The third time I went the service was terrible and the food was once again sub par. I ordered sushi, which is not really their specialty. Sushi pieces were also really big, which I didn't like. Drinks are good, but pricey. I really wanted to like this place since it is walking distance from my house but I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"I knew going into this to have low expectations, but it didn't even live up to that. Asian fusion is often a lazy way for chefs/businessmen to capitalize on Asian food's rising popularity. And this is a great example of that. 

First of all, it's overpriced for what you get. Sushi isn't anything special or better than Panda Wok on W 117th (yes, Panda Wok actually makes decent sushi) and is 50-60% more expensive. The noodle bowls for $12 (their website still says they're $10 which would be more reasonable) is quite pricey considering how little thought or meat goes into them.

I had Asian Chicken and Waffles and my wife had the Pork Ramen. The chicken was a large pan fried thick chunk of chicken breast. The dish would have worked way better if the chicken wasn't so thick and wet, and would have been much better with a more crispy exterior. The waffle itself was bland and the maple chili didn't stand out. At least you could tell they made the waffle in house, it had green onions. Slight kudos for effort.

The Ramen was in all honesty terrible. Once again, another Cleveland spot that fails to live up to the quality of a packet of Korean instant. The broth had no complexity and they forgot to add any salt. There was also almost no broth - see my photo. Rather than having a soft boiled or even hard boiled egg, they dropped the egg straight into the soup. Which maybe would have been OK if they hadn't overcooked it. The pork was tough to chew and didn't look freshly cooked at all.

I feel bad writing this review because Roxu's renovation of the building looks fantastic, but neither of our dishes showed any attention to detail. Everything sounds so fancy on menu with \"organic\" this, \"local\" that, \"sous vide\" this, but without getting the basics and the flavor down it doesn't matter.

With all the fantastic Asian food Cleveland has, I probably won't be heading back here. The sign of a good restaurant working out their opening kinks is that you find some parts of the meal really good and others you can tell they messed up. The food we had didn't have anything in it that stood out as showing promise. 1.5 stars."}
{"text":"The pork belly ramen tasted like hot and sour soup with Spaghetti noodles. Overall way too salty. It had none of that deliciousness you expect from ramen. Definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Menu was varied enough to be interesting. Steam buns were unique and perfect to share as an appetizer.
Shrimp noodle bowl had a generous helping of saffron threads which made for a tasty broth. 
Can't go wrong with the Sesame chicken pierogis, Asian comfort food-yum!
It was quiet on a Monday- but I expect that will soon change."}
{"text":"Cool place and flavor combinations. I stumbled upon this place with my girlfriend walking from Patio Tavern in Lakewood. It looked pretty swanky on the outside and outside-looking-in and 'fusion' seemed like an interesting take.

We started off with drinks, Moscow Mules to be exact. Seemed well made, could have maybe kicked it up with a bit more vodka but I'm nit picking here. The waitress was very pleasant and welcoming, always a plus. 

First comes the appetizer, being that it was Wednesday and 'Sushi Night' perfect opportunity to grab a stone crab and avocado roll crusted w/ tobiko. Real, tasty crab not the crabstick garbage. Solid!

Onto the entrees, determined it would be best to split two entrees so we could taste each flavor combination to our satisfaction ;) . We agreed to switch bowls every 5 minutes.

She got the Wagyu Bibimbap (mild) Wagyu beef, mushroom, carrot, shishito, local egg, asparagus, jasmine, chili broth. This dish was naturally gluten free and it did have an earthy nutty hue to it which I really enjoyed. The Wagyu beef melts instantly and pairs well with the rest of the bowls delicious ingredients.

I had the Shrimp Lavender (White shrimp, asparagus, lavender dashi, rice noodle, chili thread). I'd never tried these types of flavors melded together like this, lavender w/ chilli thread and shrimp in a delicious broth with ample amount of rice noodles. I couldn't get enough of it, demanded we forgo the 5 minute bowl pass rule.

We left very satisfied and after  two cocktails, a delicious authentic sushi roll appetizer, two unique entrees, the damage was only around $50 (pre-tip). Not bad!"}
{"text":"Not much to say about Roxu since we used UberEats to order some sushi while playing trivia at SideQuest. We tried the Tiger, Philly, and Piggy rolls and we both enjoyed everything.

My apologies, I know this review is really lame with its lack of details. I will have to stop into the restaurant sometime for a more involved experience to write about."}
{"text":"We came here because of a great Groupon deal. Good device good drinks and the steam buns were amazing. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The best brussel sprouts and sake I have ever had.
The lavender cosmo was also very good.
Staff was very friendly and we even met the owner, who was super nice!
The music and atmosphere was very good as well.
I can't wait to go back and try more items."}
{"text":"Delicious, lovely cocktails, very reasonable pricing, excellent service. I am also happy to hear about their late night happy hour. My hungry service industry tummy thanks you! I will be back, and often.
The steam buns were delicious, as were the lettuce wraps, and the cucumber mint gun fizz."}
{"text":"The pho is all I had. Maybe it's a bad dish and something else is better but this is unacceptable. It tastes like they tossed some noodles in hot water and called it pho. It has absolutely no flavor and makes me wish I was eating microwave pho instead. I would never go back based on this one dish."}
{"text":"The food here was OK. It wasn't bad. It wasn't great. The highlight on my visit was the steamed buns. The decor was also kinda cool. What's nice is that Yelp has a 10% off happy hour coupon when you check in. And the service was prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"The meal started off well then it crashed and burned after the cocktails were placed in front of us. Not worth the price you pay. The bun was decent but the fried rice is mushy.  The menu online isn't the menu you get when you visit."}
{"text":"After walking by this place for my boyfriend and I finally decided to give it a try. The service was sub par, our server was nice but never refilled our water. I ordered the pork belly steam bun... One word: SALTY. Not only that but it was impossible to eat. My boyfriend got pork ramen and said it was salty too. I'm glad we tried it but we probably won't be going back. If you want good Asian fusion it's worth a trip to university circle for ninja city"}
{"text":"I had big expectations.  The menu looked really good and the place has a cool vibe.  However, the execution was inconsistent.  Though the flavors were good, the rice was undercooked to the point of crunchy and the meat was overcooked.  I may try it again, since there are so many good reviews.  I'm hoping it was crummy because it is so new and that things will improve."}
{"text":"Roxu is delicious. The staff is great. Try it. Don't pay attention to the other reviews. Had steam buns to start, ramen, and the bibimbap.  All were yummy. They also had a kung fu movie playing and gave everyone Asian popcorn. Get out and support a new, local business."}
{"text":"A new spot in Lakewood that has been open a couple months.  Didn't go in for food, however my drink and experience left a superb impression on me and I will be going back to try their Ramen, deconstructed sushi, and Chicken & Waffles.  If you are looking for a refreshing, delicious, beautiful (and strong) cocktail, please order the Cucumber Lime Gin Fizz-One of the better Gin Fizzes I've had in my life. Also, order a sake bomb so you can check out the cool presentation."}
{"text":"I got the asian chicken and waffles. Might be one of the oddest things i have ever eaten. Theres A Lot going on.. Vegetables, strange tasting waffles, maple syrup very peppery shredded chicken and  some other type of meat, not sure what it is. The whole thing is rather spicy and just strange. I still cant decide if i liked it or not lol i dont think i would get this again but i will probably try something else next time"}
{"text":"Today I came for a late dinner on a Saturday night. The place wasn't terribly crowded and the service was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken steam buns and I also tried the Lavender noodle bowl. The chicken was very fresh and flavorful, and there was a hearty amount for the buns. The buns themselves are open faced but still fluffy and delicious without being overpowering. I would definitely order more of the steamed buns, and I know during happy hour they have excellent prices. The noodle bowl had a unique but pleasant flavor with a hint of lavender. I also had the bread pudding which rotates flavors, today being butterfinger (pictured). It was a very sizable portion with delectable fried bread pudding squares and vanilla ice cream. Overall the service and food was amazing, and I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Bartender was super friendly and nice. Steamed buns were on point and Buddha beer bottle doubles as a super great flower vase! Definitely recommend for a delightful Asian experience"}
{"text":"Had dinner here Tuesday night and can't say enough good things about the experience. I had started with the steam buns which were a wonderful appetizer. I went with the Chicken and dumpling Cleveland Style bowl which was amazing! The chicken and pork were tender and delicious and it had just enough spice heat to give it a kick without sacrificing flavor. I enjoyed a green tea martinis on the suggestion of the bartender Jenn and she make a wonderful drink which was extremely tasty and refreshing. She is a very friendly and personable bartender who make a pretty mean cocktail. If you like Asian infusion dishes this is a must try!!! My only criticism is the minimalistic decor can come off as a bit cold and sterile but that could be easily fixed with some pieces of art from local artists."}
{"text":"I can't say enough bad things about the food here. The ramen had one of the most rotten tastes I have Ever had in my life. The pho made me want to vomit. Doesn't taste a thing like pho. Disgusting"}
{"text":"The steam buns are great, but everything else is subpar. The short rib buns were tasty. The pierogis were ok but just had this weird taste from the chicken. The chicken at this place is really weird it almost tastes like it's old, and I'd recommend they change the recipe it's pretty nasty."}
{"text":"I had an all around great experience here. The service was above and beyond - Haley was cool, accommodating, and so adorable. The food was great! There were so many vegan options (and you can make mostly anything on the menu vegan). One of the owners even gave us his own private stock of vegan avocado mint ice cream because we were sad there were no dessert options for us. I had the \"shrimp\" lavender (sub tofu) and it was great, but a little bland, and the steam buns on lettuce were a little less food than I was expecting. The sake flight was impeccable, they are obviously very knowledgable about sake in general. I am excited to try this place again!"}
{"text":"So I got really bad reviews on this place before I went. So I decided to go and try and appetizer, a meal, and a dessert.  I had the pork steamed buns, pork belly Ramen, and green tea ice cream. Everything was very good I don't know what those reviews talking about LOL great beer list, priced well.  Staff here is amazing! Super helpful in explaining what certain things on the menu and when I didn't realize that the pork belly Ramen was made with something I'm allergic to the immediately remade it for me no problems. Definitely will be going to this place again."}
{"text":"I've been to Roxu about ten times and have never been disappointed. The fried rice is non traditional, with candied nuts in then for a hint of sweetness, super delicious. And the portion is huge. The steam buns are light and tasty. Comes with a salad with mouth watering dressing. Sushi is amazing. ( I do wish they served it more nights than just Wednesday's ). Gotta try them all. The bartender, Phil made me the best mojito (blackberry) I've ever had. My boyfriend ordered the green tea martini and it was excellent as well. the combinations of build your own hurricanes are endless, and everyone has been delicious. Oh and the Saki selection is spectacular- I recommend the flight so you can try several. Last time we were there it was busy and they were short staffed, plus you could tell they were new. So needless to say the service was slow but it was easy to look past because Phil was hustling and busting his ass to make up for it. He gave us the happy hour specials even though it was after 7.  The decor in there is chic and swanky with an Asian twist. Only thing missing is a patio. Roxu has the Asian flavor that Lakewood needs! Definitely recommend for a happy hour with friends  or a Romantic date night :)"}
{"text":"Really good food! I had the bibimbap. Meat was perfectly cooked, and i could tell the ingredients were actually fresh. Sauce was a bit more like ramen sauce, so i be the ramen would be quite good here as well. Prices are extremely fair for the large portions. I will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"As a Lakewoodian, I try to give all new restaurants a try and hope they survive amidst the well-established, beloved places in the city. So, when my pregnant wife said, \"I really want ramen tonight\" I replied, \"There's this new place called Roxu that has ramen on the menu.\" 

Let's start with what was good:

- the server (don't remember her name) was very nice, explained things well and was very accommodating

- the ramen was quite tasty; while my wife found it to be a bit too peppery, I really loved the rich broth and shinto pepper flavor

The so-so:

- the steamed buns (we got the pork and wagyu beef) were ok. The pork was better because it had a nice sauce on it; the wagyu was a bit plain. Both had what we think were chunks of beets - which were a surprise and not really complementary to the buns. The buns come with a side of simple slaw, which had a nice dressing, but all the lettuce seemed to be rib cuts (e.g. the crunchy center of the lettuce instead of the leaf). 

- the pierogies had a really thick, dense dough and dry minced chicken filling. It was an ok dish, but not one I'd get again.

The not-so-good:

- the sushi. It was sushi night, so I got the Roxu sushi roll. I'm no sushi expert, but I've had my fair share and my own personal rule is that the fish needs to be super fresh to make it worth the while. When our entrees arrived, we could smell the fish before it even got to the table - not a good sign. I was tempted to have it taken back, but was hungry and didn't want to wait for something else. The taste was quite bland and I couldn't get over the sour smell of the fish. I'm not inclined to order any sushi again.

As said above, I want this place to succeed as I think Lakewood needs the diversity that Roxu represents. I'll be back for another bowl of ramen sometime."}
{"text":"Easy to find and the decor is welcoming in that Asian fusion sort of way. Our server was a tad inexperienced and not very familiar with the menu; if you told me she was still in high school I would not be surprise. We went for bibimbap. Very disappointed with their rendition, it was more like pho. It was absolutely flavorless. Can't really recommend this place, but it is not terrible."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first time at Roxu. I don't have anything bad to say. I just wasn't super-wowed by the overall experience."}
{"text":"Second visit to Roxu did not disappoint. Highlights were chicken pierogies, mu shoo duck (crispy and caramelized), pork belly meatloaf (incredibly delicious) and a charcuterie board shared and demolished by all. Service was so-so but I'm still going back! We also killed a large bottled of unfiltered Sake."}
{"text":"This location could get five stars if they had parking but as in all Lakewood restaurants that is more rare than a real well made Caesar salad.  I had dinner there on 4/8/2016.  Made reservations via Open Table but there were plenty of free tables at 745 when we arrived.   Dropped my friend at the door and drove the car around a very long block to finally decide on a non legal spot close to the intersection but still not blocking anyone or the crosswalk.  With such limited parking its odd the way Lakewood has chosen to set the distances for cars from intersections it looks like they lose 2 cars on each street so they lose like 8 cars all around sometimes.  But so be it. Our table was just next to the car, but inside.  I was able to watch the car and when the police did in fact show (no real crime in Lakewood?) I walked out and moved it to another spot after circling the block again.  Alas it was a different non legal spot this time just around the corner and again in my field of view. So there is something to be said for the big windows they have in this regard.  If we weren't so close to being done on my second trip around the block I would have chosen a legal spot about 1/4 mile down the adjacent street. 

We had Porchetta, Porchetta (Duck, pork belly, bacon porchetta, Nuoc Mau, sesame cashew brittle) ; Edamame; Tofu Pad Thai (Cleveland tofu, rice noodle, ginger sriracha, cashew, edamame, carrot, cilantro, sweet soy)(with shrimp added). These meals were really great.   Prepared very well and served nicely.  Excellent flavors.  The fried Cleveland Tofu in the Pad Thai was fantastic.  They had cloth napkins. And reusable chopsticks which I found unusual for a Japanese restaurant.  They plating was unusual in form, white, and very lovely. The waiter was superbly informed and funny.  They had a nice wine and drink list but we had no alcohol to drink.  There are lots of cool and interesting things on the menu so there is a lot more i want to try. 

The food and service was a five,  the interior was nice I would say a four,  I like that they project very interesting photos on the walls in place of fixed art.  They are very bight and interesting.  The location with lack of parking is a two but its not a bad location don't get me wrong, its safe, well lit, on Madison and close to tons of other things.  Bill for two was about $60 with tip.  

After dinner we went to the Bevy of Birdtown for a show just a bunch of blocks away.  

We had a great time.  Just go there.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Date night with my daughter was a smash hit at Roxu. We went early and took advantage of happy hour appetizer prices and ordered the Tuna, Duck, Philly and short rib buns. They were AWESOME. I could eat an entire plate of the slaw that was served with the buns.

We split a ginger Margarita. Also delicious! The bartender was really helpful.

The pad Thai was not what I was expecting. They use traditional vermicelli instead of pad Thai noodles. In spite of the noodle difference, the dish was very good. Perfect balance of vinegar and cilantro. Lots of veggies too.

Overall a great experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Holy bologna.  This place is delicious.

I wasn't sure what to expect from an Asian Fusion restaurant in Cleveland that offered a sticky bun, \"taco style\".  This place blew me away.  

They had lamb ribs on special that were served with a Dijon mustard bbq sauce.  My bf asked if the mustard was local...the chef scoffed and said, 'no, it's an incredible seed from France'.  I LOVED every second of that exchange.  And it only further endeared me to this hidden gem.  Oh, and our waitress was perfect.  Friendly, prompt, joked with us.  The service is on point here, guys.

The lamb was tender, perfectly cooked...the potatoes with sweet corn and black truffle--I'll dream of those in weeks to come.  

You should come here.  And order the lamb.  Like, right now.  I wish this place was in Chicago..."}
{"text":"From looking at the menu prior to going in we were excited, but unfortunately it was pretty underwhelming in the end. I think we tried basically all the buns; the kung pao and duck were the best by far but even they didn't really merit comment. As for our mains, most of them went largely uneaten in very large part due to being overwhelmingly underseasoned (un...seasoned...). The ramen was the best tasting, but wasn't really very special and was definitely NOT ramen. What should have been dashi ended up being a fairly thick sauce, and the noodles were vermicelli not ramen noodles, and as such they broke down almost completely in the hot not-dashi-sauce. Service was fine, but there was only one other table in the entire restaurant.

Ultimately I can't say anything was genuinely bad, but it definitely wasn't good, and gave us no incentive to return."}
{"text":"I'll start with the positives. Our server and bartender were very friendly. Decor, though minimal, was cool. 
My pork belly steam bun was amazing. The bun was starting to get a little soggy, but still held together. Steamed perfect and filled with a delicious, savory little pocket of meat. Good size and I thought the value overall was fair.

My friends tried a variety of Pho, Udon and Pad Thai. Nobody complained, but there wasn't the usual 'OMG this is so good'. We love our food and get pretty jazzed when it hits the spot. There was a remark about it being 'NOT pad thai' and the other girls picked a lot of green pepper out of their Pho and Udon.

The Ebi steam bun (shrimp) was not quite as flavorful. I think this would be better if the shrimp was cut up? I know that doesn't do much for presentation, but if I could get shrimp in every bite it would make a huge difference. Most bites of this bun were just vegetable.

The Philly sushi roll was huge and very pretty. Something was different than typical sushi and although I couldn't put my finger on what it was, I wouldn't order it again. I feel bad saying that, because the food was certainly not bad! It's just that if I wanted sushi, I'd probably go elsewhere.

While our service was friendly, it was quite slow. There weren't many other tables so we were surprised how long it took for drinks and other things.

I'm not sure that I'd come back to Roxu. Maybe I'd grab some pork belly buns for takeout though!"}
{"text":"What a great happy hour! So many different kinds of steam buns (pork belly, shrimp, tuna, chicken, tofu) and sliders and chicken fried rice. For drinks, flavored margaritas, beer specials, hurricanes and wine!

I just want to say that their wine selection is fantastic -- a lot of unusual stuff and nothing you'll see at the grocery store for $10. It seems very well chosen and like a place where someone knows a lot about wine. So naturally, I always go for the wine deal at happy hour and have never been disappointed.

The sliders are great -- you get one per order and they come with a spicy mayo that I loved. I also really enjoyed their fried rice that was out of the ordinary: cashew brittle, shredded chicken, corn and egg. 

I will definitely be back for happy hour and I'm excited to have their regular menu too!"}
{"text":"We went here last Friday night to use a groupon we had for two steam buns and two drinks. It was pretty empty when we went around 7 except for the bar. I ordered the kung pao chicken steam buns, my boyfriend ordered the crab cake steam buns, and I also ordered the pork and greens steam buns. The kung pao chicken were meh tasting more like burnt spice and had a metallic aftertaste. The pork and greens were good and my boyfriend seemed to like his crab cake buns. I ordered a ginger margarita which tasted only like sour mix and my boyfriend ordered a blackberry old fashioned which he liked. The service however was horrible. There was only one waitress who told us constantly that she was new and seemed completely confused on how to do her job. The bartender ended up helping her with our order and the house manager was floating around and seemed stressed and not sure where to help at. It took forever for us to get our food and even longer to get someones attention to get our check. Probably won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the rest of the experience was just weird. The place is very bare bones. There really wasn't much decor or theme. It was also cold, both literally and figuratively. Figuratively in the sense that there was a tin lookalike ceiling and a worn down wood floor. College dorm room style \"curtains\" hung on the window. 

Our server seemed to only have us as a table. She disappeared for nearly 25 minutes so I had another waiter go find her. When she came over though she was really friendly and all smiles. While the kitchen was a bit slow, she promptly brought out drinks and anything else that was asked for. 

The best part was the food, which is technically all the matters, right? 

For starters we tried the Braised Short Rib Hot Steamy Bun. The beef was really, nicely flavored and accompanied with pickled onion, szechuan aioli, and cilantro. I really liked this. 

We also started with some sushi: the Unagi and the Volcano. The Unagi tasted very fresh. It contained eel, cucumber, avocado, daikon, unagi sauce, and a drop of sriracha on top. The Volcano contained a large piece of tuna and cucumber, daikon, wakame, scallion and cilantro. Each slice of the roll was topped with spicy mayo with sriracha on top of that. This was unique in that the seaweed that wrapped the sushi was lightly tempura fried. 

For my main I got the Bibimbap which was served in a large bowl. This was basically a soup, though certainly hearty enough for a meal. It contained a good serving of thinly sliced beef, mushrooms, peppers and carrots. It was topped with a fried egg and the bowl was lined with jasmine rice. I would order this again and really enjoyed the flavor and how all the ingredients melded together. 

The cocktail menu had some classics on it, twists on classics and then some signature drinks. Having never had sake before we tried the Sake Flight. Then we ordered the The Pearl and the Tokyo Mule. The Pearl was very light and refreshing. It contained Effen cucumber vodka, lemoncello, cucumber, lime and ginger beer. The glass was lined with cucumbers. The Tokyo Mule tasted stronger and a bit grainy. The taste was good, but not as smooth though it contained a definite hint of lavender. I'd definitely order The Pearl again."}
{"text":"'A' for effort but they missed the mark. I ordered the chicken, shrimp, and pork belly steam buns. Too much bread and not enough protein. I also ordered the cheeseburger steam bun. So strange! The party was thin like White Castle but with ZERO flavor. Not even salt. And the cheese was a tiny dollop of cheese sauce. Not at all what I expected. The shrimp rice was not very good at all. The shrimp was not fully cooked and had an aftertaste, possibly from the freezer? The rice was drenched in soy sauce. I couldn't handle all the sodium so I had to stop eating. Lastly I had dessert. The lavender icecream was solid as a rock. It was plated nicely but I thought I was going to break my spoon. We had to leave it at the table because it wasn't thawing. The food plus 2 glasses of wine was $50. I don't see a reason to go back, other than the nice waitstaff."}
{"text":"I felt like I was back in L.A. The room had a cool look. The drinks were fantastic.  Then the food came out.  It was better than anything I've had in L.A. at any Asian Restuarant, fusion or otherwise.   Don't waste any time getting here!  Superb!"}
{"text":"Drop everything and go!!
We went to Roxu for the first time on Christmas Day. Wonderful, kind, appreciative attitudes abounded - from the owner, to the chef, to our waiter.
We made reservations for New Year's Eve. Here we are.....just finished the New Year's prix fixe menu. Scallop sashimi, Duck Udon, poached pear salad, amongst the delightful offerings.
Out of this world, inspired chef..."}
{"text":"I am so bummed that I have to give Roxu only 2 stars...I was very much looking forward to it being great...FAR FROM IT!

I will start with the only great thing--THE WINE! 

My friend and I shared a variety of steam buns all which were pretty flavorless. We also shared shrimp fried rice and the shrimp was undercooked (ahhhhhh!) and the only flavor you could taste was soy sauce because it was drenched in just that. We finished with the Green Tea Mochi dessert, which was also not very good! It was so extremely hard that you couldn't eat it and was covered in lavender bits which didn't taste very good at all. 

Overall, I was very disappointed and like I mentioned before...I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS PLACE! :-("}
{"text":"Roxu is one of my favorite spots!  I've visited on many occasions, usually order something different, and have loved everything I've tried! The ambiance is very chill, some people are dressy, some are super casual, and I like that I can drop in and usually be seated very quickly. I love the chalkboard tabletops, it's fun to doodle and draw as I eagerly await my steam buns! haha! The staff is always personable and well-informed on the menu and are able to answer my questions. Chef Rob has truly found his calling, as his creative and delicious concoctions are so pleasing to all the senses with amazing flavors and beautiful and fun presentation. Whether you want something rich and indulgent, or lighter yet satisfying, seafood lover, meat, or vegetarian alike, there is something for everyone, and plenty of options! Roxu offers great happy hour specials, daily food specials, once a month or so prix fixe menus with cocktail pairings with a fun theme and sometimes live entertainment,, and Wednesday sushi night!"}
