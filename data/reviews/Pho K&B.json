{"text":"We have been here twice - once  shortly after they opened and a few days ago. The first time we were looking forward to Happy Hill's excellent hot and sour soup only to discover that HH had morphed in Pho K&B.  The green onion cake was excellent and the beef soup was very good. The shrimp salad rolls were okay. I loved Trong Khanh's salad rolls and I haven't had one as good as theirs since they closed. In all, the meal was good.

On our second visit three weeks later, we ordered tom yum soup, green onion cake and salad rolls. Everything was mediocre. The green onion cake had hardly any green onion in it. The salad rolls were old and tasteless. The tom yum soup tasted like it came from a package with frozen mixed seafood and a little cilantro thrown in. 

While the service was good and the restaurant was clean, you need to have good food and the quality seemed to have slipped since our first visit. Maybe we have ordered the wrong things but I don't think this restaurant will last long. My advice to the owners - cut down your menu to the things you do well then do them very well with the freshest ingredients."}
{"text":"I ordered #11 Cambodian soup and #43 vermicelli with grilled pork and shrimp. My mom and I shared both dishes. Finally a Vietnamese restaurant that can do both dishes correctly! It was really good!"}
{"text":"I wasn't a big fan of this location.  There were many Chinese restaurants that failed before it became Pho K&B so I was a bit apprehensive when I stepped inside.  It felt like this place was cursed and surely, the food can't be THAT good.  Nevertheless, I went and I was extremely happy that I did.  Large tables, clean floors, friendly staff and relaxing ambiance.  But what about the food?  All this wouldn't matter if it sucked.  

I ordered the sate.  That's usually my go to dish in any Pho joints.  It came out and it looked absolutely fantastic.  So much so, that I almost finished the soup.  That's rare that I do that because I know I'll have to drink 2 gallons of water to flush all that.  What's even more rare was that I ordered another bowl.  A small regular tai bo vien.  I wanted to know if this place was for real in terms of taste and it was!

It was a wonderful experience and I'm definitely a loyal customer.  Thought about the sate all day and finally recalled what it taste like.  It's from my second favorite pho sate place - Basil.  I'm 99% confident that it's the same chef.  No wonder I like it so much.

If you're a fan of Basil sate, this place is for you.  Give it a try, it won't be disappointing, I promise.  My only hope is that this place survives longer than the previous Chinese restaurants.  Lets keep this place in business, people."}
{"text":"We stopped by this place after driving by many times and we were not disappointed with the prompt food order and large portions coming to our table. Courteous and friendly. Simply delicious #46"}
{"text":"Just went for quick lunch and ordered a curry beef rice.  After a long wait, it arrived. But to my surprise, it was chicken instead of the beef I ordered. Fine, since I'm too hungry for all this waiting, I moved on. The curry seems a bit off color, a pale yellowish color but tastes OK. It's a bit sweet but OK. The chicken slice were so tough and overcooked. I knew it was chicken but it's texture just convinced me it's something else. 
Just teach me a lesson, don't ever go into a pho shop and not ordering noodles."}
{"text":"Thought to check it out, 11am, when it was not busy. Tried the house special noodle soup. It was ok. The soup base was't that great, I had tasted better."}
{"text":"It is the best Vietnamese food I have had in Calgary.

The restaurant is really clean and the service is fast.  I ordered my usual BBQ Chicken and Spring Rolls on Vermicelli. Not only was this dish less expensive than most other localVietnamese restaurants, the portion size was larger. It was very tasty with a generous portion of the protein. 

I would come here regularly if I lived closer."}
{"text":"One of the best soup base in town.. And they don't charge you extra for extra soup.  Good prices.  I love their preserved green chili peppers.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"I'm no pho expert and the pho I do enjoy around the city is not considered authentic or stellar by my friend, who's bf is Vietnamese. I took her to Pho K&B and she really loved the food here. 

For $8.99, I got a big bowl of steaming hot noodles, well-cut pieces of beef (non of that stringy stuff I normally get), tendon and brisket. The taste of star anise was evident in the broth. My friend's order of BBQ pork, fried egg on rice was even better than my pho. The spring rolls are awesome. Best in the city. The chef is Vietnamese too. 

I think there's some MSG, as I had that dry mouth feeling all afternoon. Service is slow, but the food comes out fast. If service improved, I'd give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Long time foodies remember this was once the home of the reliable Chinese eatery, Happy Hill, until it changed to Kushi-ya, a failed Japanese venture that lasted only a few short years. Now it's been rebranded as Pho K&B. 

The identity crisis aside, a restaurant with \"Pho\" in their name should indicate their specialty is pho. We had the beef sate and pho tai (rare sliced beef). The non spicy broth was, surprisingly, steeped with deep flavors of Asian spices and the richness of slow cooked beef. The sate broth had hints of lemongrass and coconut milk, which can be hit or miss with some people. Portion sizes and prices are fair (see uploaded menu). 

One unique item on their condiments tray is a jar of homemade, pickled sliced jalape√±os. You must try these. They're so damn good. 

The service was poor however. We flagged our seemingly daydreaming server verbally and with arm waves to get her attention even though there were only three tables. Fellow patrons resorted to this method as well. 

Pho K&B unfortunately falls short of wowing its customers due to the frustrating service. Hopefully they'll get better servers soon, but until then, we might as well start a pool for what the next cuisine this location will be converted into. 

My bet is on Korean."}
{"text":"The pho noodle dish with BBQ meats.
And Yes they do have dishes that don't have msg in it.
You just have to look, or you can ask that they don't put that stuff in.

I felt naturally full, and I order a dish that didn't contain msg products,
and it was all filling, and yes I would recommend this to others he want to eat here, the meat is tender, and the service is fast and efficient.

And the best of all the food is made fresh."}
{"text":"This place is half Vietnamese and half Chinese with the largest menu I've ever seen for a small place! It had soooo many options it's a bit overwhelming but good to bring friends here because there will be something for someone. I ordered some Chinese dishes and some Vietnamese dishes the Chinese dishes were great the satay pho noodle soup didn't taste very Viet lol.. tasted like a Chinese version satay so they lose a star for that. Other than that I would definitely come back here"}
