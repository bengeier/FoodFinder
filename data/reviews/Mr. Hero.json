{"text":"It's a Mr hero. You know exactly what the food is going to be like. stop here on my way by needing a quick lunch. it is without a doubt the cleanest Mr hero I have ever seen. People working there probably the owners were very nice. 5 stars because if you have a Mr hero franchise you cannot do it better."}
{"text":"i love these guys since new management took over. this is a guilty pleasure for me but staff is always quick, kind, friendly and consistant."}
{"text":"For out-of-towners, this is a must-do. Its a local fast food restaurant with the King of burgers, the Romanburger. This particular location is clean and has very friendly staff. Since we were in Cleveland on vacation, they helped guide us through the menu. Waffle fries were delicious and the Romanburgers filling. Check it out for a quick, greasy treat."}
{"text":"I have been to numerous Mr. Heros all of which are extremely clean and have friendly employees. Not this one! If I hadn't already paid for my order I would have told the employees never mind so they could go back to playing in the back room. If you are so slow maybe you should grab some cleaning supplies and sanitize that nasty hole."}
{"text":"This is the best Mr Hero in Lakewood.  The veggies and bread are always fresh.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful with the sales as advertised.  Their cook is great!  He is so fast even when you have a large order and it is still perfectly made and tasty!  Romanburgers are our favorite.  Cheesecake is tasty even though it is prepackaged."}
{"text":"This is not my favorite location.  The staff is friendly. The lettuce tastes funky every time we order from here.  I'd much rather drive a little more into Lakewood since that location has fresher tasting veggies."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable! no restrooms! the people cooking were arguing. So rude to people...you have to ask for ketchup and they only give u 4 packets. food wasnt horrible but not great. nickel and dime you for everything here. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding in EVERY WAY!!!!!!  Everyone connected to this location are exceptionally nice, caring and GREAT people.  They make this customer feel special each time I visit.  I recommend this location to nearly everyone I know for excellent service, quality food and confidence that every ounce of serve will be GREAT!!!!!!  The owners or franchise managers at this location are special in the Mr. Hero network.  My first though for food when on the fly."}
{"text":"If you're familiar with what other Mr. Hero locations offer, well, this one does, too.  Considerate ownership and management goes beyond what is required.  Visibility can be a problem coming either direction on Detroit.  About 3 or 4 small tables, and a bench inside for waiting.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I could write all sorts of superlatives in an attempt to describe the experience, but if you have never eaten a Romanburger, what's the point - words fail to describe it. If you have eaten one, then there's also no point - you already know. The only negative: Mr. Hero has not escaped the state of Ohio, indeed they only exist along the shores of Lake Erie. The cruel gods have left Toledo as the closest restaurant to me - I long for road trips to Detroit so that I can stop and eat a 14\" with a side of waffer fries with cheese sauce. Cruel, cruel gods."}
{"text":"Very clean, friendly staff. Sub was different but good, like seasoned roll. Fries could have been a bit crispier."}
{"text":"This is place is always so clean! Nothing but great service here! PS - This is great hangover food!"}
{"text":"Whole family got together and ordered 20 sandwiches and loads of fries. They got the entire order correct and food tasted great. Staff was super friendly and very helpful. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I been to this location once I took family for lunch I  Will not return.  This was two years ago I took matters into my hands asking in a manager line. The staff would not recommend the product to first time customers.   The meal that my family member ordered both hadplastic the counter person and grill person went through with her hands picking out the plastic calling it good. There was a good amount of water on the floor enough for someone like an elderly to slip and fall.  No caution cone or anything.  After speaking up management never really do care about its customers.   The manager at the medina location on us 42 is not nice never does smile and never thank people like me for coming in."}
{"text":"There are 2 locations in Lakewood, this and the one on 117th. I will make a longer trip to specifically go to this one.  The 2 men that are always working in the afternoon here are extremely nice and efficient. I pick up food here on occasion for my office and those 2 have no issues busting through a 9 person order in 5-10 minutes.  I also come here to avoid some of the people that go to the 117th location. That area can be hit or miss."}
{"text":"I came to Cleveland on Mother's Day weekend for two reasons - to see my mom and get a Romanburger.  I don't even know where to start. I walk in and the smell was odd. I can't describe it but it didn't smell right. Unfortunately, I still ordered (dont judge me). First I don't recall roman burgers being so high in cost but I still paid. Then I ask the lady where was the restroom and she hands me a key with a long wood piece attached. My first thought was maybe my mom should relocate cause if you need a key to get into the bathroom at a establishment then you are probably in a bad area. But nevertheless I take the key and go to the bathroom. When I opened the door it smelled and looked like death and destruction. I decided to give that lady her key back.  So it takes about 10 minutes to make my romanburger and fries. When my meal comes out I ask for ketchup and the lady hands me 1 pack and tells me she is not allowed to give more than 1 pack per customer. I had her to say it twice cause I was flabbergasted. Who owns this Mr. Hero? Who raised this lady to think that's ok to say? I just left feeling defeated. My fries were cold. Romanburger wasnt even as good. Bread was hard and although I said no tomatoes they decided it was best that I get tomatoes. Ugh."}
{"text":"Christ on crutch - I can't believe I'm only the second person to review Mr. Hero!  Let's face it.  Two phrases are owned by this franchise.  1) Romanburger  2) Hot Buttered Cheesesteak.  I can't even get into the ridiculousness that his the Hot Buttered Cheesesteak.  All you need to know is this...if you have heart conditions, avoid it.  If you happen to be physically shaped like Drew Carey in anyway, avoid it.  If not, proceed with caution, lest you wind up with heart conditions.  I'm not even joking.  On to the Romanburger.  What can I say about this sandwich?  Be still my beating heart.  No.  Seriously.  Stop beating so fast.  I...I think it's...it's going to...explode.  That's pretty much an accurate representation of your condition after consumption.  In all honesty, its delicious.  In the magical land of Cleveland, if you place the following items on a sandwich, it becomes \"Roman\":  - Lettuce - Tomato - Grilled Onions - Salami  - Provolone Cheese  As an American of Italian descent, my first reponse is \"WTF?\".  I then coalesce to the aforementioned deliciousness.  The sandwich is a hoagie bun topped with burgers (hence the romanBURGER, up to 4 I believe for the largest size) piled with LETTUCE, TOMATO, COOKED SALAMI, PROV and a bit of mayo.  Did I mention that it's quite delicious?  Once again, I can't even get into the rest of the menu as its more or less schitzo...filled with a variety of grilled subs, pastas, meatballs, and pre-packaged \"big ag\" potato products.  But, if you're looking for something new and different, try the Romanburger...its Cleveland's answer to the Philly Cheesesteak...it's just got a shitty press rep."}
{"text":"I do LOVE a Romanburger. However, this place is getting dirty. The look and smell of this place turns me off. I will,not go back until it gets cleaned up as I don't trust the food anymore."}
{"text":"Zesty fries are prepared to order and piping hot from the fryer! Owner was friendly and service was efficient."}
{"text":"Siggghhhhhhhhh...............................................  Coming here makes me REALLY miss home.  As I bite into my Super-Bad for Me Roman Burger, I sigh inside.    I also truely miss the Hot Butter Cheesesteak with its melt in my mouth steak and cheese.... ahhhhhhhhhh.....  I know that there are no Mr Hero's in California and Colorado.... and tonight I am visiting my parents in OHIO and we were trying to figure out what to do about dinner.   They suggest subs, and then I remembered... it was like a light bulb going off in my head, and the music chimes in my head of a great idea!  And this is where I go.    Waffer Fries with cheese?  O M G ... Why can't I make it this good at home?   The food overshadows any wait time for it... and trust me, you can wait a bit if they are busy.... I have seen this guy for years here, before I even moved away. Always friendly and always busy...  I REALLY REALLY wish they would open on around me in Denver.. talk about ULTIMATE comfort food.  Ok, now to slip off into my food coma ZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....."}
{"text":"Love their Roman Burgers. Primarily go to their drive-thru window. Service is quick n employees friendly"}
{"text":"This is the cleanest fast food restaurant I have ever been in! Harsha is the owner she runs the register most times  I have been going here for 10 years  I will not eat at any other Mr Hero since! This location should serve as a staple for any fast food restaurant or sit down for that matter super clean ! In the 10 years I have went here. never a wrong order  never a problem  and I sometimes have problems with service at other restaurants"}
{"text":"Excellent location with brilliantly grilled subs. Nice clean store and always friendly staff"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and employees are always friendly. They will take you at last minute even 1 min after closing."}
{"text":"Well I came based on previous reviews being I'm here in Ohio on business. I stopped in and immediately was greeted warmly by Harsha at the counter. I ordered a Chicken Philly meat and cheese only and substituted Swiss for Provolone and am Kinda perturbed it cost me $1.5 to change out cheeses. The waffle fries were fresh and hot. The cheddar cheese was good but wish it was bigger for .80. For sure though the sandwich and fries were hot and fresh. That was very welcomed based on most fast food places not meeting that mark. I agree on the fry scale as there wasn't 1 single fry more than their scale told them their should be! Big bag for the Waffle Fries but could of put some more in there for sure. Overall I would probably recommend this place but probably not  at 13.00 bucks for what I got in exchange."}
{"text":"10 times better than the one on E. 152. The food is always hot and made right. The employees are friendly too."}
{"text":"This location serves fresh menue items, in one of the cleanest Mr Heros that I  have  visited.  The staff is efficient and super friendly.  Even though they cook to order you are in and out pretty quick. Getting  my Hot Buttered Steak Fix tonight."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Had to keep repeating my order to the cashier over and over. He couldn't get my card to swipe and stood there and looked at me like I was crazy when I told him to enter it manually.  I think there's only 2 people working the lunch rush. My wafer fries are barely cooked. Went to go ask for ketchup, got sick of standing at the counter waiting, so I gave up. We've come here a few times for lunch, never again. Worst Mr hero I've been to so far. Would not recommend unless you want to waste half your lunch waiting."}
{"text":"The best Mr Hero I  will never go to a different one . This store is well managed , food is good and workers are truly happy working there . And what you get is good food from that equation.There is always a great movie playing on the television's as an added extra while you wait."}
{"text":"Very nice and clean restaurant. Fast service. Very pleasant experience. Good quality food"}
{"text":"Credit card policy is a bit of a joke. Typical Mr hero food. Decent 4 lunch. Friendly staff, crazy policy on cards. I was using cash but while waiting for my food 4 customers walked in and walked out because of the policy. Talking about cutting off your nose to spite your face."}
{"text":"We grab take out from this location a couple of times a month.  We generally order Roman Burgers (the big 10 inch) with everything, large waffer fries with extra cheese, and large sodas... by the time we get home we've usually put a serious dent in the fries.  The restaurant is usually busy (we generally show up between 7 and 8 PM).  The only real downside to this restaurant is the hours... they close early (earlier than the other fast food restaurants in the area).  I think they must close around 9 PM which doesn't always suit our schedules (it's actually quite devastating when a craving brings us out for Roman Burgers and the restaurant is dark).  The Mr. Hero in south Akron is open much later so I think the hours of operation vary with owners.  I will also comment on the fact that the staff weighs each and every single order of waffer fries... I find this interesting, especially when they are SLAMMED and customers are crammed into the waiting area.  The cardboard trays/paper bags that the waffer fries are served in leave NO room for extra fries.  However, the staff will add fries and place the bag on the scale, then subtract/add a fry and re-weigh, and then repeat the entire process.  This goes on until some unknown margin of error is met and the fries (which may be nominally warm by that time) are whisked into the to-go bag next to the cooling sandwiches that were ordered some time before.  Why weigh fries when you can't possibly shove too much in the bag that they are served in??  Hmmmm, this remains a mystery....  Oh, by the way, extra cheese should be ordered for the large order of waffer fries... the \"large\" cheese is only an extra 1/2 squirt of cheese bigger than the \"small\" cheese.  According to our research this is not nearly enough cheese to adequately coat your waffer fries (and your arteries).  ;)  Somehow the cheese topping stays warmer than the fries, thus making the cheese topping a necessity for all to go orders."}
{"text":"I like this Mr hero location, always friendly service and the place seems clean. The lady at the counter is efficient, unlike most places such as this in the area."}
{"text":"Friendly and accommodating staff. We placed a large order on a busy day and they were very helpful and the food was delicious! Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Did not like. Slow service and bad environment. Inside a liquor store. Very poor location."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Hero sandwich shops in the country! I believe it's a chain only in the Cleveland area! I blame this place for my weight! The Romanburger is an institution and the Hot Buttered Cheesesteak is heaven on a bun! We often have them make a deconstructed version that we can cook at home in Chicago or Atlanta!  We have also spent many a night attempting to recreate these masterpieces at home! We've come close but never perfect!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mr hero's around.  Nice people and good food.  I have been going here for over 10 years."}
{"text":"First of all my sandwich was excellent.  The problem I'm having with this restaurant was while I waited for my sandwich I was disturbed to see a shelf with food right next to the slop sink where the dirty mops are kept.  Another thing that was strange, there was a large lay down freezer right behind the register?   I don't think I'll be going to this Mr Heros again."}
{"text":"My first visit to this place. Went through to grab food for me and my coworkers. 3 of us got the gyro and 1 got the hot buttered cheesesteak.   #1- if you are going to claim tzaziki sauce,  then dobt water it down.  It was cucumber water on my gyro.  #2 you will get corrected if you call it a yeero and not a j-eye-roh  #3- the cheesesteak was not hot or buttery and it was small, like the previous review stated. The meat to bread ratio is a little off.   I would not Go back to this place."}
{"text":"As I waited for my order I was surprised to hear orders phoned in. As the wait grew, I understood why. One could die of starvation waiting for their order. When I arrived, there were a party of 4 sitting at a table. I didn't pay close attention, but thought they were eating. Nope, 10 minutes in my wait, their order was called at the counter. Then another 10 minutes and the people who were standing at the counter, drinking their sodas, finally got their order. Another 10 minutes and mine was called. This place requires careful planning: you want to arrive before you're hungry.  Place was clean. Cashier was friendly. Sub was OK, though skimpy. Would give 3 stars, but Yelps rating says 2 stars means its nothing special and I've had better."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was awesome.  However, there's no public restroom so we opted to go to another Mr. Hero."}
{"text":"As far as fast food goes, you can't get much better. The romanburger and waffle fries is 10x better than anything you can get at McDonald's or Burger King. They also do a lot for Villa Angela-Saint Joseph High School right down the street."}
{"text":"I politely suggest you avoid this place at all costs.  I placed a to-go order that was supposed to have included a philly cheese steak sandwich.  What I received was a mutant gyro that tasted like what I believe 8 day old raccoon road kill would taste like."}
{"text":"I don't normally hit up a lot of chains, but Mr. Hero is local and so I figured I should finally check it out, (also they happened to be open on a Sunday night).  Nope. Not a fan. Just a weird mediocre experience. (Weird because the kid who took my order giggled at me a lot.)  I just don't get the appeal. Instead of a detailed review here are some descriptive words: humdrum, boring, dull, lifeless, bland, insipid, blah, banal."}
{"text":"I walked up to the entrance at 7:58 and the turned the lights off right in front of me. Closing time is 8:00. You should not be walking out at 8, you should close at 8:00."}
{"text":"Best Roman Burger!  Every sandwich is made with care by great staff!  My fiancé noticed after numerous visits that the cook does not leave the cooktop at all when making a Roman burger. Seasoned just right.  Simply the best of any I have had elsewhere.  Just a good fast food joint."}
{"text":"I love this location. The people are great and their food always seems to taste better than other MH franchises.  Of course it helps that it has a drive thru, but I really do like the people who seem to manage it, both daytime and evening."}
{"text":"Your typical Mr. Hero, just much cleaner.  Depending on the night, you might wait a little for your order though.  They do get pretty busy.  They do take call-in orders, however.  If you know what you want, I would definitely recommend calling ahead."}
{"text":"Don't understand their restrooms situation.   The signs say no public restrooms   I've been here twice and both times I've asked to use the bathroom I got the \" someone's in there right now \"  And they have to escort you to the back to go in a tiny room with a toilet.  And they wait for you to come out so they can bring u back to the front."}
{"text":"Charged me for a pop refused to give it to me when I asked for a refund she started using foul language and yelling at me told me to get the **** out and don't come back."}
{"text":"I love this place.   I'm here 2 times a month and spend 40 each visit.  Our food is cooked fresh, no mistakes despite numerous special instructions.   The family that runs this location is always polite and curious with a smile."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, sometimes a short wait because they make each order fresh, nothing laying around under lamps, it is always made good.  Only wish the soft drink cups were a little more generous on the combo meals.  Other than that, excellent place to grab a meal or snack.  Their dining area has a tv and the only pet peeve is sometimes the free wi-fi free loaders."}
{"text":"I hit this once and a while when i wana feel gross about myself..lol.  Romanburgers are the SH*T though.. Its like every other M.H. except it has a drive through..laziest thing ive ever seen.  Food quality is not as good as when i was a kid.  This one takes phone orders and coupons w no problem.  Get food right most of the time.  NO FRICKIN ONIONS!!  ;)  For anyone from out of town...try a Roman...it  will change your life! ;)"}
{"text":"Always nice but they try to nickel and dime ya to death with the extras.  Stay strong and keep your eye on the prize....Romanburger..."}
{"text":"RIP OFF REPORT!:::   I ended up paying $45 for a meal when really there was a better deal going on for $25.   Make sure you ask what specials they have cause you'll seriously save half."}
{"text":"Haven't even got my food and already a one star experience. Order taker couldn't be less excited about my order or her job. Took my order and then with a big huff of breath declared, \"it'll be a while!\" I'm the only customer here...what?"}
{"text":"This is the benchmark of the Mr. Hero franchise. It's fastidiously clean. The food is exceptionally consistent. If you have had Mr. Hero before and not liked it, try this Mr. Hero. The owner usually runs the register and is polite and efficient."}
{"text":"Service wasn't the greatest but they were prompt and the food tasted good. I will be back here in the future, I'm sure."}
{"text":"Put a 7\" Sicilian in your mouth.  5 stars as far as fast food goes.  Get nacho cheese for your waffle fries and/or sandwich for the best thing ever.  Spotlessly clean establishment.  Same family has run this place for eternity."}
{"text":"Decided to randomly stop here on the way home after a trip to Cedar Point.  The place could use a little fixing up, but who's counting.  The only employee I encountered as friendly and helpful.  Pricing is pretty good, but the philly steak sandwich seemed a little small for some reason.  Either way, the food is pretty good, and the employees are nice so I can't complain."}
{"text":"Food was good, quick, and fresh. Cost is high, but nothing unexpected. Food for 4 adults and 2 kids, we spent about what we would have spent at applebees or Fridays without alcohol.  Also something a little off putting, there were 4 air fresheners in sight in the lobby. Not sure why."}
{"text":"Ok....again I am only going to review this location seeing that everyone at some point in time has been to a Mr. Hero.  When I first came to Cleveland and started work in Euclid, I ran over here just cause I was hungry and was told I should at least try it once, so I did.  This location, at the time I went, was dirty.  Smell inside wasn't all that appeasing but I was hungry.  I went with the standard roman burger and one mushroom burger.  What a mess.  They overly sloshed both sandwiches with mayo or whatever the white mess they put on it and I went through every extra napkin I had in my truck.  I really felt like a fat ass and vowed never to go back again.   That's when my strike three policy came into play and I decided to try the one on Chardon, about a mile or so away.  To my surprise it was much better.  Ingredients seemed fresher and it appeared that a little more love was put in.  I still don't recommend eating here given your options around the area but if you must, drive up to Chardon and 6, its just a little better."}
{"text":"I've always got good food and fast friendly service here. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes MrHero food."}
{"text":"Best Mr. Hero I've ever been in.  The owner is very nice. Store is always clean, though the restroom probably needs a makeover. Other staff are also very friendly. If you're craving Mr. Hero, this one is where it's at."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food in Ohio! I do not live in Ohio anymore and this is one place I miss so much!  Romanburgers and potato waffer fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"I've never seen this chain/franchise before.  So I gave it a shot on a recent trip.   First impression wasn't great, wasn't terrible.  Funny smell when I first walked in, unidentified.  6 small tables or so for inside seating and a take out / ordering counter.  The place looked clean to me. Really nice lady took my order.  7 inch meatball sub, zesty fries and a fountain drink, all for under 7 bucks.   The food was good overall, especially for the price.  Good competition for subway."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Mr. Hero in A few years. It's not exactly the healthiest place to eat! But if you're looking for some deep fried goodness, this is the place to go. The food was hot & fresh! I ordered a Roman burger, waffle fries with cheese & breaded mushrooms. Yum yum yum! Restaurant was super clean, and staff was friendly. I ordered a family meal & was able to customize the sandwiches."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Mr. Hero in over 10 yrs. and the waffle fries are still just as good as I remember. I also stole a few of my husbands Zesty fries, they taste a lot like Arby's curly fries except these were fresh and crispy.  My service was polite, clean and welcoming as well as the restaurant itself. If you can manage to get through the horrible traffic, this is a meal worth  making a genuine effort for."}
{"text":"This is probably the strangest Mr. Hero i've ever been to, but i'm a recurring customer because the service has always been good. The store itself is like walking into a Mr. Hero in 1997, i'm pretty sure the menu board/graphics have never been updated.  However, it seems to be dependent on who's working as to how your experience will be. I typically end up there Fridays during lunch hour, and it's always two older Indian guys working. They are super fast and efficient, and can handle a rush with no issues.   Friends and family have gone there at various times, and at some points, the store is totally staffed by two or three teenagers. This seems to be when orders get messed up and the store isn't as clean as normal. My dad had a $6 item missing from his bag, and a friend did not get the correct size of sandwich and was overcharged. Check your bags and receipts!  Overall, I can't complain, but I see why others do."}
{"text":"Servic e an food excellent thanks again..the new store in the old KFC looks great..romangurger BTE...$1 more 50% more beef, lunchmeat an cheese..what a deal..."}
{"text":"So, I recently get an e-mail form Miranda at Yelp. She informs me that my recent review of this Mr. Hero restaurant had been \"removed\". The reason why?   Their \"Support Team\" \"determined\" that my original review \"lacks a substantive firsthand experience.\"  My original review, censored, but unedited, read as follows:  HIM: \"You want some cheese sauce boss?\"  ME: \"I don't need your f*****g sales pitch.\"  HIM: \"I'm just doing my job, boss.\"   Clearly, Miranda from San Fransisco has never visited this particular Mr. Hero restaurant in beautiful Strongsville, Ohio. But, since I want to give Miranda as ultimate an experience as possible, allow me to reciprocate with an updated review that possesses a little more substantive firsthand experience.  Nothing beats a Romanburger. Nothing. And, when I am back home I always need to get me a couple. So, I go to the Mr. Hero on Pearl Road.  It was late. The maniac that appears to run the place is a rotund, foreign man. He is dark with even darker bags under dark eyes. All I wanted was the biggest Romanburger they offered. I made it as simple as possible for him, but he insisted on calling me \"Boss\".  I hate that.  His every move was aggressive, but I kind of understood it. He was, after all, about to serve me a 14 inch Romanburger sandwich. Sure, currency had been exchanged, but in the end, he was doing me the favor. But he keeps calling me \"Boss.\"  And then the bird gets burned. Hence, the original review.  HIM: \"You want some cheese sauce boss?\"  ME: \"I don't need your f*****g sales pitch.\"  HIM: \"I'm just doing my job, boss.\"   If you've ever eaten here, you understand. So, as far as \"substantive firsthand experience\" is concerned, I hope you love me now, Miranda.  For those who have never visited the Greater Cleveland area, a (7 inch) Romanburger is this:  \"Two juicy grilled burgers topped with melted Swiss American cheese, grilled Genoa Salami and Italian Luncheon loaf served on a bed of shredded lettuce with tomatoes, onions, a sprinkle of Mr. Hero's original oil'n spice and topped with our own special recipe mayonnaise - served on a hearth baked Italian roll.\"  The cheese sauce is actually a great dipping side for the Wafer Fries they offer.   Firsthand. Substantive. Miranda."}
{"text":"Another great service experience. This location is fast, friendly, and warm. Great neighborhood addition."}
{"text":"Went into this establishment this evening it was approximately 830pm. There was a guy standing by the grill. He said we will be right with you. Mind you there are no customers. So I couldn't understand what was the hold up. After standing there for about 6-8 minutes 2 people came out from the back. A young lady comes up to take our order. As we ordered our food I told my daughter to get it in a combo because we were eating here. The lady taking our order looks at me said in a very nasty tone our dinning area is closed. I looked around and laughed. I said closed, we still have 30 mins before closing. She looks at me again and said we are closing in 20. Needless to say we didn't buy anything.She was very unprofessional. I won't be going back there again. Please save your money don't buy here."}
{"text":"Hands down the friendliest fast food  owners. Periodically stop here and we ask about each others sons. Service is quick and food made fresh"}
{"text":"\"Bless me, father, for I have sinned.   It has been 2 years since my low, 2 star review for Mr. Hero's.  But once I explain, you'll see that I shouldn't be held accountable.   Hardly a deliberate transgression, it was more a truthful, innocent \"omission\"---only because I didn't re-visit sooner.  Full responsibility for my less-than-glowing review lies with Mr Hero himself, since he started it all.       In so many words, I wrote how much I didn't agree with the asinine decision of Hero's corporate \"geniuses'\" to dispense with the high quality hoagie rolls they'd used for *decades* in favor of super-soft squishy ones with likely 6 month shelf lifes.  I couldn't help being honest.  They had \"fixed\" something that wasn't broken, father.  Offering an unnatural substitute---like Wonder Bread for grown-ups---might not be evil, but it's close.  Over-processed billowy weightless air-filled ves---    (Audible yawn.)  ...air-filled vessels of fluff, and not of this earth.  Since that review, whenever I happened to drive past this Mr Hero's, I never gave them a fleeting glance.  And without hesitation, every Hero coupon arriving at my home in newspapers or advertising was added to the stack of recyclable junk mail.  But then, a couple of months ago, an epiphany.  After a nearly two year abstinence---albeit effortless---I had the sudden realization that I really truly missed those unmistakably and uniquely Mr Hero *flavors*.  I decided to try replicating.   Although their Tuna salad was very good, mine is excellent, so no need there.  If this is a sin of pride, so be it, father.  Mine IS damned excellent.  Amen.  I went to work on the ones enjoyed the most: their Original Italian, Romanburger, and Hot-Buttered Cheesesteak.   By using the best cold-cuts, freshest cheese onions mushrooms lettuce tomatoes oils seasonings, and even Black Angus ground chuck, sliced roasted sirloin, and Orlando Bakery's expire-within-hours hoagie rolls, they turned out great.  But honestly?  Still failures. They lacked Mr Hero's *SOUL*.  Certain \"somethings\" were missing---namely their impossible-to-find mild Swiss American and their impossible-to-duplicate \"original blend of Italian oil and spices\".   None of my creations had those incomparable, inimitable FLAVORS.   (Muffled hip-hop...Dr. Dre.)    So, I weakened, father.  Just suck it up, I told myself.  Forget about that squishy Hero dough.  Pretend it isn't there.  In truth, with all that airiness, that wouldn't be hard to do since it almost WASN'T there.  I'd try them again and instead of thinking about that bread, I'd enjoy all the other parts.    I didn't know it then, father, but in my SUV, on the road to Mr Hero, I was on the road to my redemption for that 2 star review.   An unexpected Revelation and about ten tasty visits since!  And each time, a multiple variety of well-prepared favorites on fresh, substantial rolls very much like the ones from the past.  As it turned out---per one of the owners those newly-introduced rolls from two years ago went through even FURTHER transformations.  I had cut Mr Hero off---before those corporate geniuses had managed to screw their heads back on.    (Snoring sounds.) Father?...Father? (Throat clearing.)  Anyway...because of the harsh---but honest---references to SUBWAY in that review, I was thinking it would only be fair to give THEM another try, too.  Maybe THEIR hoagie rolls had gone through mindless corporate changes just like Mr Hero's.  But NOW, since Jared Fogel---Subway's former spokesperson and soon-to-be-registered sex offender---just pleaded guilty to child porn and child sex...yeah...I know...all too-familiar sounding...I think I'll wait a bit to work up a healthy enough appetite.  And, sorry to rub more seasoned hoagie salt into any wound--- couldn't help myself---it's *alleged* that Subway knew about his perverted penchant while in their employ.  hmmm.  (\"hmmm.\")  So---onto penance, father.   Frankly, I don't feel I deserve any.  With this update, I'd say a  dispensation is in order.\""}
