{"text":"Went back for my birthday on a busy Saturday night and just got poor service.  They seemed unorganized, deer in the headlights, steaks at our table weren't cooked right, my Chicken mango salsa was not any good, had to ask two time for an ice bucket fr the wine.  Calamari appetizer was luke warm."}
{"text":"Not recommended. They can't cook and they can't serve. What ever you do, DO NOT order the steak, unless you like it burnt! The dishes are overpriced and small. They refilled our water at the end of the meal. The fish and chips were soggy and possibly sitting on the counter for an hour or so. All I can say is good luck to anyone trying this place out...Don't say we didn't warn you!!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time here. Decor was nice and cosy. Ordered the escargots gratiné, it was very salty and swimming in butter, it was good to dip your bread into. Ordered the All you Can Eat mussels. Selection very limited to 4 types however they give out plenty of side options other than the standard \"frites\". My bf had the tuna steaks and it was cooked just the way he liked it.  Nothing outstanding but food was pretty good but not for the price that we paid. BONUS: you can go bring your own wine !"}
{"text":"Verry poor service! They gave us a table and after 10 minutes very rudely told us to move because they made a mistake in the reservation. Then we waited for an hour in the hallway with our glass of wine because our table was not ready. Terrible! Food was good not much. Entries are too expensive. Service was terribly slow. Unfortunately very disappointing."}

{"text":"Went on Sunday January 25th,2015. At 6pm made reservations. Which we really did not need to we were practically the only ones there. First impression the place is very nice; very comfartable yet chic. The waitress was nice only spoke french; not a word of english. Its ok we were all perfectly bilingual. But she made no effort to speak a word of english and made sure of that. Four of us ordered the \"only\" basic burger on the menu; considering the name Rouge Boeuf you would think their meat on the burger would be tasty. Well after a long wait (again empty restaurant). The burgers came on a white plain plate (btw not on a wood board like the pictures show). The main problem their were ALL burnt and dry; tasted bitter and plain out tasteless; as if they don't season anything not even salt. The bread was bigger than the burger and not fresh. Gave us a handful of steamed vegetables you would get at ikea. And the fries were good but it seemed it was their leftovers cause it had many bits not full sized fries you can actually dip in ketchup. The two other people had the steaks one was good and the other one was not tasty at all and considering the price not worth it at all. These plates also came in white cafeteria plates and same disgusting sides. One person had risotto I think that was the only thing good. Someone had crab cake as a appetizer is was awful. So back to the burgers I told the waitress that all four were burnt and dry; she didn't seem to care too much but said she would tell the back. No one came to apologize; no reduction in price; no little free dessert for the inconvenience. Very bad management and service. And for $20 for a plain burger nothing on it but bacon and cheese; we all knew not to come back ever and where we should go instead. Desserts; why did we even attempt after a disappointing meal. The creme brule was instead a creme caramel version. Not good. The coffee dessert was plain and boring. The xango was good but gave you a spoonful of ice cream; wow. All in all we would never return there. I'm a personal food critic. Don't waste your money because its \"bring your own wine\". Drive a little further to good bring your own wine places."}
{"text":"Good ambiance. I had the steak rouge beuf which was normal (I can do better at home) with shrimps that were tasting like rubber. I think that we have lots of other places where we can eat the same food for less money. Didn't motivate me."}
{"text":"When there with my boyfriend couples week ago with a groupon special. We were pleasantly surprised by the wood décor. Very trendy!  Dint expect to find this kind of restaurant at a far end of Montreal suburb. The meal was delicious and very well presented. The service was average. Is a BYOW place so Thumb up for that! Will go back for sure"}
{"text":"Steak Frites en bonne et due forme. Apportez votre vin !  Nous avons été la-bas pour la fête d'une amie. Le service fut excessivement lent, probablement à cause du groupe mais le reste de l'endroit était presque vide... Le steak était de bonne qualité et cuit saignant comme je l'aime. Le copain a pris le steak de thon qui était délicieux, mais les a-cotés laissaient a désirer : la pomme de terre était dure et avait l'air d'avoir passé 1h sur le comptoir...   J'y retournerais probablement si on m'y invite, mais je ne pense pas y aller de mon plein gré."}
{"text":"L entrée de tartare de saumon est fade et sans saveur.  Les petites ligne de coulis au balsamique au fond du plat n'ajoutaient rien au niveau de la saveur.  Franchement ratté. La salade cézar semble a base de Miracle Whip. Y'a un ptit goût sucré décevant. Plat principal New York Strip Steack cuisson bleu . C était un steack de truck stop.  MAl cuit, gris... N allez pas mangez a cet endroit, c est très mauvais.  Nous étions un bon groupe, le 02 février 2013.  C'est un bel endroit avec du bon personel mais les produit son de basse qualité.  Qui est responsable?  Le chef?  Le proprio?  Une amie a pris une sorte de rizzoto avec des fruit de mer... une pétoncle était délicieuse et l'autre pas cuite... \"Come on\"  C'est quoi ça?  elle a laissé le reste de l'assiette.  Le service fut excellent, serveuses/serveurs très attentionnée et gérante plus que cordiale.  C'est dames devraient trouver un resto qui serait à la hauteur de leur qualité.  Elle méritent mieux que servir des plats si mauvais.  Ha oui, dessert, tarte au chocolat... disont chocolat au chocolat... loins d'être une tarte.  Je n'y retourenrai jamais."}
{"text":"Belle ambiance. Service un peu lent pour un groupe de 10. Entrées et plats principaux classiques, sans prétention. 100$ pour 2 pour un apportez votre vin, je peux manger mieux ailleurs."}
