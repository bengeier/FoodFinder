{"text":"No happy hour price when they have live bands. Okay place to hang out with friends. Not crazy about there food, but drinks are okay. They need to state on menu no half price when there is live entertainment."}
{"text":"A GREAT find!  This place is seriously awesome! It has fantastic food, affordable, ambiance is amazing...and GREAT service!   I am from Chicago visiting a couple of my best friends who lives in Vegas. Came with a good friend of ours from Cali, that was intrigued of this place that sells Filipino street foods. To my surprise...I had a BLAST! I was impressed and would highly recommend this place. Service of Ate Aleth was great! She is such a sweetheart! If not for her, we probably will not be as comfortable. She entertained us and she is so much fun. Also Brian, DJ/bartender, was so nice! Both of them, made us stay longer and enjoy the night!  But aside from great people, the food was very good! Kwekkwek, isaw, tapsilog, bangus sisig are just some of the food I recommend! It was good that I was not even hungry and ended up eating so much!    Overall, it's the place to be!  Kudos to Bar Kada and Thanks for an amazing night!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! we asked for some ranch it and when we tasted it, it was awful! Their buffalo chix wings was terrible too!!! Old! Yuck!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious lunch. Lots of food choices available.  Great place to hang out after work with your barkada!"}
{"text":"Sisig fries ftw! Went here on a Saturday reggae night, good food, good beer, great live reggae band, had a blast!"}
{"text":"Seriously for being Hispanic I felt welcomed at this place you guys need to try this dish called sigsig I tried it at other places in Vegas I think this place takes the cake with the food! Thanks again bar Kara ave for a memorable time!! I Will definitely  come here more often."}
{"text":"First time eating in this place. The isaw is good !!! Friendly waiter. The ambiance is really friendly."}
{"text":"Great spot to chill! If you want a good service.. And friendly atmosphere I highly recommend this place. We went here for a friends bday and Bryan has been the best with accommodating us with our needs. The drinks were always on point!! Food was great too! We will be coming back soon and we will be bringing more friends!"}
{"text":"Nice new place for Pinoys to hang out in Vegas."}
{"text":"Okay. Hostess had no idea what she was doing. Food came out really late and undercooked too. The atmosphere was bleh. I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody. Wouldn't come back even if I was starving to death."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. There was only two tables including ours, our food took FOREVER. And after our female server took the orders 30mins later, she came back and told us they didnt have kalderetang kambing. Really!! After 30mins taking our orders. So she gave us the isaw and chicken bbq at the same time. When she was supposed to bring everything AT THE SAME TIME. Or at least ask us if we want a certain food item first than the rest. Then when the kare-kare was brought to our table, first bite, it was already too salty. And there wasnt any tripes in their kare-kare.  We also ordered fish balls, and the fish balls took longer than the rest of the food. Hah! More than an hour wait for the fish balls. This place is nothing but a joke! Dj's were lame. And also, they charged us 20% gratuity. Why?  Service suck! And the food quality was bad, not worth paying, not worth spending. Working in a steakhouse, party of 6 or more is normally 18% gratuity automatically. And barkada is nothing compare to a steakhouse so why would they be charging 20% gratuity? So I did complained on that til they correct it to 18% the way it should be. We were all very disappointed. And would never go back there. Lame ass rip off filipino is how i define BARkada."}
{"text":"The environment and facility is fantastic. We reserved the space for 80 people and were terribly disappointed. We were promised a bunch of items and the night before our party they were not able to fulfill the order. They were understaffed, didn't provide a lechon (pig) and then dessert was not prepared. The main owner promised us some drink tickets for beverages and again they did not come through and charged us extra.    After all this our guest host opened a gifted bottle of alcohol and they wanted to charge us a cork fee. Couldn't believe it! We were taking one celebratory drink and they weren't going to budge after all the other things fell through. I can't say how disappointed I am and we are. That's 80+ people they lost business to over trivial issues and a lack of preparedness. The saddest part is the food is good, the facility is great, but the management was very poor. 2 stars is being nice and mostly due to facilities."}
{"text":"Sisig fries are a must try! Even the cocktails are good. I have tried the Baguio and I must say it was every good even the strawberries infused with the drink was bomb. They do close at 3 but no matter it's stil a good place."}
{"text":"Ate here couple times with family and have brought couple put of town friends as well.  Place is clean and have a good combination of different age group of people coming here not just young pinoys. You'll also find good mixture of different nationality here which is cool I think.  We have tried couple foods from the menu:  1) Fishballs - love this! Although it's quite expensive if you happen to be here before or after their Happy Hours and on the days they don't have the Happy Hours (Fridays & Saturdays) which I think was disappointing.  The fishballs is yummy... the closest to Philippines kind of fishballs.   2) Tokwa at Baboy - another fave here! The pork is cooked to perfection and matches very well with the crispy tokwa along with the yummy vinegar sauce they put in it.  3) Kare Kare - not all that for us. It lacks flavor.   4) Tocilog - love this one as well! The tocino is good although not the same as the Philippines style but the flavor was great with the garlic fried rice and eggs (just wished they put a little salt on the egg like how it's done in Philippines) & the vinegar dipping sauce made it taste even better.  5) Chicharon Bulaklak - my hubby and friends loved this one. Didn't try it as I'm not a big fan to begin with but the boys loved the crispiness with the vinegar dipping sauce.  6) Pork Sisig - our friends loved this dish as well. They said it's well seasoned and it was delicious.   7) Crispy Pata - this is another delish dish although I prefer DT's crispy pata better.  8) Happy Hour foods - Isaw was disappointing as it wasn't the same as the ones you get in PI. The consistency was veey different.  Pork belly liempo was very good...melts in your mouth and can eat a lot of this for sure. The bbq beef was disappointing as it was not cooked well when it was served. The inside of the meat was cold and tasted uncooked. Server tried to still charge us for the uneaten meat. So during the happy hour, we really only get the fishballs and the liempo.  I'll probably try the other food next time.  9) Drinks - I loved the Baguio & Tagaytay!! I also loved their guava and guyabano drinks.  Ambience:  I have to agree with other yelpers that said it can be very loud in here.  Kinda hard to have conversations over dinner specially if there's not a lot of people yet.  Service:  The service is hit or miss.  Sometimes they are very quick, friendly and prompt in getting drinks and orders.  Other times, they are not attentive to their customers where you have to constantly flag them to get drink refills.  Overall,  it is not a bad place to hang out. Will definitely be back to try other foods in their menu."}
{"text":"I met a group of friends for dinner to celebrate a birthday. I had this venue bookmarked for a while now. So when I heard dinner was @ this venue, I was excited! I recently took a 3 week holiday vacation in the Philippines and I gobbled up all the authentic Filipino food I can eat! Too bad Pinas has no Yelp :( Anyway, I was prepared not to expect too much at Bar Kada Ave since I just came from motherland. I was glad I didn't have high expectations because the food was just OK.  I ordered the chicken skin which I thought needed more garlicky flavor. They served breakfast all day which is a plus for me. I had breakfast (Tapsilog) for dinner. The two food I ordered were both barely served warm. The tapa was super tender but needs more flavoring. The garlic fried rice was not the best I've had. And last, service definitely needs improvement. Overall, it's nice to have a place where people can eat, drink, and do Pinoy Karaoke other than the better known Cafe Moda."}
{"text":"The servers were nice but it took AN HOUR for my food to be served. Horrible. And it doesn't even taste good. Not even worth the wait."}
{"text":"The best Filipino bar/karaoke/club in Las Vegas. Make sure to try their delicious foods like Sisig, Sisig Fries, Sisig Bangus, Tokwa't Baboy, isaw, Fishballs, Silog plates, and many more! Plus they have the COLDEST BEER in town, Beer Below Zero. Highly recommended to all party people in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was cold!! We had Bangus Sisig. The plate was sizzling but not my food! So u can tell they just heat up the food!! The pork Binagoongan was good but cold too! Told our server so Chef came out with the re-heated food with an explanation that it's fresh not re-heated. \"YES IT IS REHEATED!!\" He said food got cold because it was sitting under a lamp. Wth! Lamp? Not warmer. Plus heres the thing NO APPOLOGY! AWEFUL EXPERIENCE! My 1st & Last Time there!"}
{"text":"This is my review for FOOD Only. Food is no bueno! I came here during the day time at lunch hour. I was more interested in the YouTube videos and Filipino dramas playing in the background than the food I ordered. I'm sure it's meant to be more like a bar and lounge and loads of fun at nighttime. For food I wouldn't recommend dining here if you're sober."}
{"text":"Have you ever looked at someone because you're just soooo into them? Your eyes all big and googly? Like you just can't resist them? Welps, that's me everytime i see the food i ordered on it's way to my table here at Bar Kada Avenue. The food is sooo good that sometimes I wish someone would look at me the way I look at their food. Kwek-kwek, isaw, pisbul, pancit....oh my....getting hungry just thinking about it. They also serve Red Horse (yep it'll sure kick you in the bum-bum), the bar offers this beer as cold as your ex gf's/bf's heart. The live bands are very entertaining. Good music and they have dance floor if you wanna get your freak on :). You will definitely feel at home. Do you miss the hell out of the Philippines? This is the place to be, tambay, sunog-bagas, kantahan, jamming, tagay-tagay....you got it here. I Love this place. B to the A to he R to the K-A-D-A my God it's Bar Kada my God it's Bar Kada my God it's Bar Kada Avenue"}
{"text":"Great place, good food, and happy servers! Perfect place to hang out with friends and family. They have spacious room, serve authentic filipino viands \"ulams\" and cool people. Their happy hours are from 7pm-10pm with 50% off on all appetizers and $5 on signature drinks. I specifically liked their sisig fries and signature cocktail called \"tagaytay\". Will surely recommend this new place. :)"}
{"text":"this place is so fun! my wifey invited me and a couple of ladies out for some girl time and we decided on bar kada avenue to start out our evening because of their advertised happy hour deals. upon our arrival, we learned that they don't offer the happy hour specials when they have live entertainment, which they had that evening, so that was a bummer and should be noted on their advertising but i digress. it was a saturday night and they had a dj as well as a live band. both were decent and played many songs that we all knew and enjoyed.  our server was very sweet and accommodating. the drinks were good and the food was tasty although not gourmet, definitely fitting for a bar scene.  i will definitely return for some more fun here and am interested in attending their karaoke nights."}
{"text":"Poor service! 30 minutes for our calamari to arrive wt just 10 costumers the night of july 4th. For the bar tender -do you know how to make Margarita?"}
{"text":"Really yummy filipino food!! Whenever I come, there is always music playing via customers singing karaoke or doing some type of ballroom dance. Portions are large and they offer a wide range of the filipino cuisine. And if you come during happy hour appetizers are really cheap. Guava juice, tapsilog, kare kare, and sisig. Yum! They also have all the til-tilan or like sauces if you want them haha."}
{"text":"This place doesn't deserve a star, but had to click for comment to post!  What a rip-off!!!  What I ordered wasn't the same as pictured in the Filipino newspapers.  Ordered the fishballs which didn't taste like the ones sold along the \"streets in the Philippines\" as BARkada claims.  And this was the ultimate rip-off, I was charged $4.00 for 4 pcs. of banana cue on a stick (1 pc of banana cue = $1.00) and those tasted bad, so customers beware!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and the place was empty, but we also came in 45 min after they opened. We ordered the staples:  Longsilog and Tapsilog- good Bulalo- super bland and meat was tough Kare Kare and came with singing soup- All bland Sisig Fries- very good, but only had a little sisig on top.  The sisig here was flavorful and wasn't greasy as DT's. The atmosphere is like every Filipino restaurant, where there is a karaoke and a dance floor. Am I the only one who that is tired of this look and somewhat embarrassed? Anyway, that's just a personal opinion.   Server was great and very attentive. Place was clean including the restrooms (a plus). I will try this place again and order other items."}
{"text":"First time here,  CRISPY PORK BINAGOONGAN seems much much better here. They put sliced eggplant, diced mango and tomato. Also their CHICHARON BULAKLAK was cooked just right. Yummy and melts in the mouth.    I just ordered for pickup and so far the Service is POOR. Servers were apologetic so maybe they are used to apologizing, who knows.  I will come back and try other stuff on their menu."}
{"text":"Fun place with decent happy hour food. I would go back for Sisig fries! Music is hit or miss depending if there's a band or DJ. Service wasn't bad. House draft beer is a good price for the taste. Should be coming back again some day."}
{"text":"my boyfriend and i went to check out this place.  it was nice and new as what you could expect in a new bar. but the service and the food is not good at all. i tried their sisig it was blunt, on top of that it took forever. the restroom didnt have toilet paper and toilet seat cover."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place. Probably will not come here again. Came here with my family looking for some flavorful Filipino food, and left dissatisfied. The only thing we actually enjoyed was our pancit canton. The servers were friendly though, that's why I gave it two stars instead of one. Not to mention, the food took a very long time to prepare despite us being the only customers. We even had to cancel one of our orders, because lack of time. If you do go here, I hope you have a better experience than we did."}
{"text":"I went here a couple of times to hang out and catch up with my friends, each time leaving me with a great impression of the place--All of the food are delicious and cheap, and all the drinks are the best I've ever had; last night (11/10) didnt disappoint. This time we went there to celebrate one of our friend's birthday. At first I was really tired and wasn't in a celebrating mood but the server (im sorry tita, i didnt catch your name) went ABOVE and BEYOND to accomodate my needs and made me feel comfortable. She really interacted with us and helped create a fun atmosphere. Next thing I know, we're cheering for the birthday girl while she sang her heart away. Im really happy that the DJ, all the staff, and the FUN crowd made her feel special that night. My girlfriends had so much fun that we ended up on stage ourselves singing our favorite song. The atmosphere last night was the best. Everyone was rooting for everyone, even strangers. Our highlight of the night was when we hung out at the Bar. We were being tended to by the bartender Brian. He really made us feel welcome and comfortable and gave us the best service you could possibly get. The party truly started at the bar when one of my friends had the blowjob drink. Ladies, you must try it! The birthday girl was so happy that she started tearing up several times! All of us left the place in a very good mood and fun memories. We will definitely come back for more. This is a great spot to celebrate and let loose with your friends! I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Halo Halo is bomb with a rum and coke on the side. Everyone should come here its awesome"}
{"text":"I love that they offer dollar sticks appetizer whole day. Their isaw & liempo are really good."}
{"text":"It's a typical Filipino restaurant, karaoke included. This place isn't very vegetarian-friendly. The bar is small, but has almost any alcohol you can think of. Shots can be kind of pricey, at over $7 each sometimes. There are 2 dance floors and fun lighting. The DJ is easily accessible and will take music requests. Even though it wasn't very busy on a Monday night, service was still attentive."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed on their sisig the service is slow.. no dont go here"}
{"text":"Hell yeah im a fan! lol The HH bbq sticks here reminds me of my childhood. They offer isaw, liempo, betamax, walkman, beef, tongue, hotdog, chicken feet and many more. I frequented this place 3 nights in a row from when i got introduce to it. haha. I ordered isaw, liempo, kwek-kwek and beef. with some white rice and a dipping sauce of vinegar w/ chilis and onions. YUM! Isaw is thoroughly clean and doesn't have that bitter taste that usually is evident if it wasn't cleaned properly. I like this the most. They have karaoke and a Dj certain nights. Service is satisfactory but the food makes up for that. Bar drinks/prices are reasonable too. Always excited to eat here. try it out!"}
{"text":"This place has been some of the best filipino dishes we've had here in Vegas. They also have night life on weekends. They have live bands and karaoke at night. Their sizzling sisig is the most popular. They also have some fusion dishes like sisig fries and tacos. There's also a bar for those that need to prepare for some live karaoke. It's great for big parties. And I mean BIG parties like birthday parties and wedding receptions. So there is something good for everyone."}
{"text":"Went with friends on a Saturday night.... Not a place for young adults... Folks dancing ballroom to Pittbull... Hmmmm It's a place for moms, titas, titos, and dads.... Drinks and food menu are cheap enough tho. On the food:  - the sisig fries took over 20 mins to get to the table from ordering and it was lukewarm and the shoestring fries where cold and had no crunch to it. - the chicken wings were crunchy outside, hard and dry on the inside, flavorless... Tasted like frozen chick wings."}
{"text":"Came here to watch a comedy show and I thought the venue was decent.  Since it was late, I was too full to order food.  However, I did order halo halo with ube ice cream.  It was pricey for subpar halo halo.  $7.49...and to think that's the same price as the fish balls skewers, isaw.  Earl and I will have to return to try other items.  The service was good.  Bryan kept checking on us.  Earl also ordered san Miguel light and another IPA.  He thought the price was decent.  For now, I will rate it as A-OK.  Will update once I tried more food."}
{"text":"Only place I know of that serve silogs (your choice of meat, egg, garlic/rice, tomatoes, and vinegar for dipping!).... MASARAP! ***mouth watering just thinking about it***  Tocilog (tocino - pork) Longsilog (longonisa - sausage) Bisteksilog (beef) Bangsilog (fried milkfish)  I've been here 3x in 2 weeks. This is either really sad or pretty smart! lol  Initial visit was with a co-worker around 9:30pm on a Monday. No one was really in there and, yet, it took the host about 5 minutes to notice us (even tho she was 10 feet from us at the bar). After seating us, I immediately ordered the bangsilog (I was starving!) and he ordered tapsilog. We loved it. Large portion of garlic fried rice with crispy garlic chips on top. Milkfish (bangus) satisFRIED (yes, I said satisfried) my craving for fish. As a first timer, the food was enough to keep me wanting more...sadly, the service was lacking because I had to wave the girl down for water...and it wasn't busy.  Second time, I convinced handful of friends to come here for Sunday dinner. Oddly enough, when we arrived at 6; the place was busyyyyyyyy. We waited 15 minutes to be noticed/seated; and it wasn't even by the hostess --- the bartender seated us. Turns out they were slammed with a family party that had 20 extra people in the rsvp. You know us, Filipinos, travel with the village! The bartender was nice enough to bring out a makeshift/party table onto the dancefloor for us. He kept apologizing, as well, for the lack of immediate service....He kept saying that they were understaffed. We said it was \"ok\" cause, in reality, ish happens...that's a part of restaurant life. We ordered family style sisig fries, sisig nachos, chicken wings, bangsilog (for me), bisteksilog, eggplant torta, and tapsilog. Sisig wasn't even close to being as good as Café Moda's sisig..not crunchy. The nachos, obvi, had cheese on it and it was a weird thought but, didn't taste too bad.  My friend loved his eggplant torta, more so, after dipping it in his banana ketchup. Chicken wings were whatever.  Overall, everyone was satisfied with this visit. BUT, we were charged 20% auto gratuity for our large group.   Third time's a charm and a friend had her husband's 30th bday festivities there. We came on a Friday and got reserved tables on the dancefloor. Ordered whole bunch of apps (pancit, veggie lumpia, shanghai lumpia) that were blah.  The veggie lumpia was all lumpia wrapper and had no veggies in them.  Shanghai lumpia was burnt. Pancit is a no brainer and can't go wrong. Steller stand out was when my roomie ordered chicken skin and fried rice. UGH. That chicken skin dipped in vinegar is drooooooooooooooool **mouth watering** Friday was $5 Patron and AMF. Needless to say, we were entertained all night with people karaoke-ing, rapping, and dancing. It's as entertaining as a normal Filipino party =)   After these 3 visits: - Service is lacking; only because they're understaffed. Bartender was great! - Food isn't a real standout, other than the SILOGS! I mean, really..... =) - I need to practice my karaoke skills cuz one day I will have more than enough AMF to really get up there and sing in front of complete strangers."}
{"text":"I work night time so usually get off at 10 or midnight & this place timing is perfect for my late night hunger. They are open until 5am. The food here is so satisfying. I've been here three times and it never disappoints.  I've tried the Sigsig, fried adobo rice, bagoong fried rice, garlic rice, karekare, pancit canton, street food. I made sure I ordered my favorite types of filipino dishes haha, and a friend recommended the sigsig and sure enough it's amazing and a dish that I've always ordered every visit. So if you go here I defiantly recommend the sigsig and adobo rice or on a lighter side garlic rice... Sooooo satisfying. I like intestines, so the Isaw and pig ears for street food on a stick dipped in their sauces, vinegar and onion... Amazeballs!"}
{"text":"If you're looking and craving for a Filipino dish late at night and with a decent ambience here's a place I could suggest. Upon entering, you'll be welcome with the fun filled ambience yet we got a 3-5 minute wait upon the hostess greetings and for us to be checked in, though regardless she greeted with a warm smile.   Upon seating, and ready for ordering... It was a fast check in. (I hope it's not bcos it's a weekday though... But well see. Next time yea? Lol) So, food came and it's a wooooow... Portion wise, it's good for two or three. (Good job on that.) How was the food? My say, it's mouthful.   not bcos I eat these kinda but it is indeed mouthful.  #thumbsupforthat   They also offer a dance floor for those people who have a happy feet; Sound Check wise:  Great selections to begin with. Not those oldies kind of songs. Up to date. #niceselectionsofsongs and in case you feel like you wanna sing your hearts out, they offer that too. IF you have the guts or you just wanna have fun, microphone is free for grabs.   The only thing that I would say I would minus my stars, was when our server missed one item. (I guess our female server didn't hear us bcos of the sounds. Let's just say or yet let's blame it on the sounds. Haha) but again, regardless our servers was up to their game. Table touching, was just a 5 stars.  They also offer their bar... Awesome. (Good job on the \"No under 21 allowed\"   So above all, our experience is a 4 Stars. Maybe next time, I'll for sure add that 1 more star. Oh wait before I forgot, they also offer a $15 off on 50 and up. So, a must try. A way to end a Manic Monday.   Till next time.  Oh, wait before I forget; one more thing that bothers me was the \"headset\" (and it was our female server, she's using it on the floor which for me is a no-no.)... Errr, to think the sounds was at it's blast, how on earth will she possibly hear us? Oh, well again... There's another day. I'm still giving a four stars. Customer Service is a must to me still and it was a superb."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for the first time yesterday (Sunday). Must say, it's a great place to hang out and catch up with old friends and family, especially for Filipinos.   I ordered I think, Hotsilog? (Philippine hotdogs, eggs, with fried rice) and oh my goodness they have balut! (something DT's doesn't have). It definitely made me miss the Philippines. For the first time in 12 years, I tried balut again and well, I wasn't really a big fan of it knowing there's a dead bird inside. My parents told me I used to eat them a lot before but I was young then. I only ate the yellow part though. I also ordered fish balls during happy hour, now THAT was the real deal. I couldn't stop eating it!   After we ate, my family sang karaoke, like a usual Filipino would do. Overall, I loved the place and I'm positive my whole family loved it too. We will definitely come back! :)"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food here (sisig fries, isaw, sinigang, and kwek-kwek)!!! However, service wasn't too great.. Servers need to be more proactive and be nice to your customers, don't Just try to avoid eye contact and act like you don't see them when they're trying to call you and ask for something!"}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at this restaurant.  And I must say it looks similar like Cafe Moda.  They have a dancefloor, if you want to dance and there's music always playing.  Now for the food.  I don't know the names of some of the traditional filipino foods.  But I order whatever tastes good.  My friend told me to get the pork with fried rice and egg.  I did.  And it's really good. Also the waitress was really nice and gave good customer  service .  She gave us a discount when she saw the Yelp had a 15% discount on orders over $50.  I don't mind coming back to try the other foods on the menu."}
{"text":"First impression was good!  Beautiful waitress.  I wish I got her name.  Maybe next time.  Tried the street food.  Let's just say it's street food, don't expect amazing."}
{"text":"terrible service. terrible food. salty, salty, salty! we ordered sisig nachos..n 20 min later the waitress comes back and says 'we do have nachos, but no cheese!'  wow...it took 20 min to tell us that.  we had to settle for sisig fries.  when the fries came 10 min later ....it had cheese on it!?!?  how the fries had cheeese, but the nachos didnt have cheese is a mystery to me.  first bite of the fries, all u can taste is salt... and more salt.  the rest of the food came another 20 min later n was all loaded with fat on the meet. i had tapsilog and 50 percent of the meat was fat.    service was so so so sloooow.  please note we went in on a sunday at noon.  we were the only table there n yet it took forever to get food.  to add to the slow service we had to deal with the band doing microphone check for the ENTIRE time. 1) u would think u would do that prior to opening so customers dont have to hear 'mic check ...hello hello mic check 1 ..2...1...2..'   2) u gotta love how professional they were while doing mic check...  'mic check 1 ...2..tuyo...tuyo hehehe joke lang...joke lang'  real cute to hear then crack stupid mic check jokes the entire time.  on the way out (just less than 2 hrs)...they were STILL doing mic check and we did not even get a thank u from waitress or the manager as we walked right by them.. they were too busy and too good for us as they  stood and listen to 'mic check tuyo tuyo...1 ...2  tuyo\"  horrible!"}
{"text":"I have to give Bar Kada a lot of credit for originality. They have dishes that you won't find anywhere else such as sisig tacos, and sisig nachos. The only other place I've seen and tasted sisig tacos were off of the White Rabbit food truck in California. Then there are the sisig fries; they are the bomb. Combined with the friendly and accommodating waiters and bar staff, atmosphere, drink specials, and DJs (decent sound system by the way), Bar Kada is easily a place to get hooked to. As long as they continue to build their brand with their uniqueness, they can easily build a cult following. I also heard that this is the go-to place topsilog.  By the way, I am not Filipino. I am Mexican-American."}
{"text":"Only came here for drinks while waiting for a cab so I don't know about the food. The drinks were pretty cheaply priced for vegas, but what really shines is how friendly and engaging the staff was. They even called a cab for us when our cab didn't show. Planning on taking my family here next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food here is ok. Their taho tastes different from back home. I wasn't a fan. I ordered balut and it was overcooked and dry. The three times I visited the place there is always barely any people. I can probably see why. The decor/ interior was tacky and their music needs to be more modern. Service was ok."}
{"text":"Pretty good pinoy street food isaw,fishball and qwek qwek ! Sisig was okay but still love Gerry's Grill sisig in Cali!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and awesome customer service. i went there yesterday with my son for a quick meal. we ordered chicharon bulaklak, quek-quek, isaw and tapsilog and it's the bomb."}
{"text":"Sisig fries tho ahaha so bomb especially when ur drinking a nice cold beer with it... I don't recommend going here on College night tho unless it's a frat or sorority event. No one really dances and everyone comes past 10 or as we speak Filipino time. Good for dinning bad for turning up ahaha"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Granted it was a Friday night but knowing it will be busy you would expect the service to be on point. The waitress was sweet but could not provide any info about certain things on the menu. Sisig fries was a disappoint. A whole bunch of fries and barely sisig. Fries were dry and our waters wasn't servers after 25 mins. Turon, was another item is have to ad to the list of disappoint. Was not made properly. The music was way too loud and the smoke machine was terrible idea while people eat. I will not go here ever again."}
{"text":"Came out for a intimate gathering of friends night out and decided to come to this new spot for drinks and bar food.   I split chicarron bulaklak and sisig with a few people. The chicarron was decent, but I prefer smaller cuts so you get better crisp to the fatty center ratio. The sisig is fairly decent. I think maybe we should have ordered a bit differently only because it was greasy pork bits overload, specially since I was just at a taco crawl event earlier.   They had live entertainment, a band and a DJ during their intermissions. There is a stage if you want to dance. My biggest complaint was the volume. We left after a bit because we could not hold any conversation. I tried and ended up a bit hoarse and gave up. There is a happy medium as I've been to bar hangouts where a seat in the back meant you can have both. Most of the people really into it anyways will be dancing, right in front of the band so you don't need it to blare.   Just a note that they offer happy hour specials daily of 50% off appetizers and $5 drink specials (7-10pm) but do not while there is live entertainment. You may want to call and ask if you're coming there for happy hour on a weekend.   It's not a bad Filipino bar though. It's typical vibe of the bar-staurants in Philippines."}
{"text":"stick to the sisig dishes. everything else whatevers. not the best Filipino food in town but it will do if you need some drinks and want pulutan. I think this is a lot better than café moda. service is really slow here, even when the place is empty.  this place really needs some updates on the décor though. its old looking and seems like there is always a broken chair or table. the booths def need a facelift."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time for the Glen Jacinto event. There was a huge fight between the opening band and some of the audience. They evacuated the place but some people already left without paying. Bad first impression. There was hardly any staff for a busy night and our food took literally an hour to get to us. The food was okay, nothing special. Service was ok. What a disappointment. Will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Omg! I ordered bangusilog, I was so hyped up food was looking really good!  As I was eating I can smell something awful ( like sardines not the milkfish we ordered ) so my friend told me. \" hey Jen they didn't wash the utensils well, it has a nasty fishy smell\" I was like \" ewwwweww! Gross ! The utensils wasn't washed well or sanitized for that matter. Must have been hand  washed with other fishy stuff. Yuck! I was so disappointed. The young lady serving us is such a sweetheart. But this issue sure does have to be acknowledged by management."}
{"text":"I wanted to take my friends out for filipino food and this place was a huge let down and I was kind of embarrassed. The lady seemed like she kept forgetting about our table and we waited at least 30min for the food, plus waters didnt come till right before food was finally being served. The food was also disappointing. Yes, theyre pretty original with the sisig fries and tacos etc. but if you cant execute a proper meal just dont serve it."}
{"text":"Bar Kada is part of the blaring loud environment where you can eat and scream at your table mates. A group of seven of us came in during a live band night. We didn't know that they were doing anything special, but know that it will negate the happy hour they would normally run.   The cocktails are on the sweeter side. I should have expected it, almost everything I ate or drank in the Philippines is sweet.   The chicharone and sisig was decent. They are greasy and artery clogging, but that is half the enjoyment. The fried pig skin was light and crispy. The frying process helps to break down the tough skin and make it so airy. The sisig is a blend of fatty bits and meaty pieces. The jalapenos were spicy and the squeeze of lime juice made it oh so enjoyable."}
{"text":"So I didn't try the food, so this review is for the bar/club atmosphere. So I have to start of with the fact that I hate the whole restaurant/ club thing. I don't want to eat my meal with music blaring in my ears. And I have to yell to place an order. The laser lights sparkling up the room made it feel cheesy. The music was constant and too loud. It was a Saturday and they had a live band and a DJ. I really wasn't into either of them. Some older women took to the dance floor and had a good time which is nice to see. It wasn't very busy . The drinks weren't horribly expensive but they were weak. No Happy Hour prices since there was a live band:( I would not go back!"}
{"text":"First time to Bar Kada, can't say I will be back any time soon.  First impression is that the decorations are very cheesy and out dated.   I like the large wood tables branches, seems like it would be cool to come as a big group.  The over all first impression is not greatest, old/out dated and look used or dirty.  The fish tank is the  cleanest item in the place!   The regular dinner music is really loud you have to shout to the person sitting right next too, it's really stupid!  So we came here for the \"Star Quest\" Contest and we paid for the $25.00 Buffet and without a doubt the worst buffet in the history of all the buffets in the world of all time.  The beef had really good flavor, but was chewy, I almost lost my back teeth chewing it!  They had a chicken & Veggies with quail eggs and the ran through the pan and forgot to stop, there no meet, a sad dish food!  The Pork pan had the most flavor, it had chunks of potatoes and carrots and was good, to bad after ten people it was all gone!  The chicken screw was made of chicken thighs and the meat was not trimmed of the fat.  The pork belly was way over cook and had  no flavor.  Five items and the food was gone in seven to ten minutes. Over all dinning experience \"don't eat the food!\"  The staff didn't check on us for drinks or any thing.  Lousy experience, way too many options in Las Vegas to waste time at a place that is out dated, that has poor food and really creepy service!  Las Vegas has over 4000 places to get a dinner and a cocktail, I would try them all out before I retuned to bar Kada!"}
{"text":"Love the freshness of this new Bar and Karaoke place and personally I love the BBQ yeah! Love ths drink too (Baguio) :)"}
{"text":"Good service and great food! We ordered the kare kare, tapsilog, bisteak, lechon, sisig, fishballs, and isaw! All very delicious!"}
{"text":"I give this place 2 stars for ambiance and cleanliness. I went there for lunch and had their point point specials, the lunch special was reasonably priced, but the food was not really anything to rave about, the lechon kawali/ lechon, whatever it was did not taste good at all and the skin was like rubber. The chicharon bulaklak or what the americans call chitterlings, was ok, it wasn't soggy or nasty, definitely much better than fiesta or DT's. The rest of the menu items are just plain bland, lacking in flavor like the cook was afraid to offend the customers. This i can say though, if you are craving Filipino food for lunch and just want something quick, cheap and filling, this is the place to go, it's definitely way better than going to Fiesta Filipina and getting a headache from all the MSG they put on your food. Hey at least i did not feel like throwing up after eating there. It is sad to say, there are not many good Filipino restaurants here in town, expect maybe if you eat at home and cook the food yourself...tsk tsk tsk"}
{"text":"It's a newly opened I understand but it was bad experience... My coworkers and I were looking for a new place to hang out afterwork since Cafe Moda and Gimik is pretty much dead.... I thought this place would be dif.! It's not the atmosphere we were looking for .. Kids shouldn't be allowed a certain hours, Dj need more varieties if you want to bring in younger crowd, we ordered 3 appetizers it took literally an hr to arrive, they run out of Barkada beer@8p (happy hr 7p-10p) bad business, and it's warm beer... I had to ask for ice@the bar.. Beers should be served with cold glass, and with cold beer! I guess I'm so used to PT's Pub! We spent 3 hrs@this place hoping it'll get better.. We could of walked out but I was such in good companies of my friends... Although there was this guy server that came to our table- he offered us free pitcher since he felt bad with our experience.. He was trying to set it right! I would reconsider coming back because of him but not too soon! Improvements is much needed!"}
