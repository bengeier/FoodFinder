{"text":"More of a take out place but there is couple of tables u can eat there. Mostly for take out, I would say its pretty good. the girls up front are efficient.  The prices are reasonable.  love there eggroll.  I have tried other places in Huntersville for takeout. I still end up coming back to Jin Jin."}
{"text":"Fairly priced and ready quick. We ordered the sesame chicken with steamed rice and sweet & sour chicken with fried rice last night. Wish the menu was online but thankfully someone posted pics of them on yelp. We used to grab Panda Express out of convenience but it's definitely worth driving a couple extra minutes. We'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and was worried if i would find a good Chinese restaurant. Jin Jin is awesome. The food was delicious, especially the house special fried rice."}
{"text":"Just what you would expect from Chinese take out, no frills, just good, quick, cheap take out. There is seating there if you wish to eat in."}
{"text":"Excellent food - especially their crab Rangoon, steamed dumplings and lo mein. Very pleasant employees, quick turn around on phone orders. Be sure to ask for their house hot mustard!"}
{"text":"Decent food... We ordered the seseme chicken combination and it was good. Crab wontons were excellent.. I would recommend them."}
{"text":"We order from Jin Jin about once a week.  It is hands down the best Chinese food in the area!  Consistent and everything we've gotten is delicious.  Usually get General Tsos and Beef with Broccoli.  Their chicken wings and crab rangoons are excellent too!  Very nice people, and fast/easy pickup!"}
{"text":"So there are several Chinese restaurants in the Huntersville area... a couple even deliver. Unfortunately, Jin Jin does not deliver,but they are the best Chinese restaurant in Huntersville.  They are super nice people and their wonton soup is good. Their Genersl Tso is really good. Wish they'd add a bit more broccoli, but there are some restaurants in the area that don't put ANY.  I grew up on Chinese food in the Bronx and Queens -- the Mecca of Chinese restaurants :) You won't go wrong choosing them."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Huntersville and probably Charlotte.  Consistently good food."}
{"text":"You want Chinese take out....thus is the place.  Food is always,consistent. It's taste like what you expect it to..nothing fancy...price is fair for portion."}
{"text":"We've ordered take out here several  times and it is by far the best Chinese food in the Huntersville/Cornelius area. Great food and never longer than 10 minutes once our order is called in."}
{"text":"Being new to the area (from ATL), we hadn't had Chinese food in 6 months. I was hesitant, but saw some good reviews. It was yummy & it was quick! I went inside to order & they were cranking orders out. The guy taking the orders was pleasant.. food was priced descent & he told me my order would be ready in 15 mins! Here's the kicker.. IT WAS READY IN 15 Mins!!"}
{"text":"It's just okay Chinese food. Nothing special about it really. It seems like take out is much more prominent here as we were the only people who actually ate sit down, while there people coming in and getting take out while we were eating.   We came right around 3 o'clock, before dinner and after lunch. They seem to do more business for lunch than for dinner. Lunch is also much cheaper than dinner. I think they should extend lunch time hours until 4 o'clock instead of ending it at 3.   I got General Tso's chicken with fried rice and an egg roll. It wasn't a huge portion and was much more rice than chicken. It was extremely mediocre tasting. It ran me a little over $9 without a tip or a drink for just mediocre Chinese food.   They also don't have a soda fountain and they give you water out of a pitcher they have behind the counter, which I thought was rather peculiar. Wasn't bad, but I'm not really rushing to go back."}
{"text":"This is our go-to for Americanized Chinese take out in the area. It is very similar to the Chinese take-out I was used to in the Northeast, and as an added bonus they don't use MSG in any of their dishes.  My daughter loves the General Tso's combo plate, my husband consistently orders the Moo Shu pork, and I like to switch it up. :) We have never been disappointed with anything we have ordered. I especially enjoy the fact that many of their dishes are heavy on the veggies compared to other Chinese restaurants; I especially like the pork with Chinese Vegetables dish. The best take-out Chinese restaurant in Huntersville, hands down!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a good Chinese place since I moved to Huntersville. I FOUND IT.  The staff was very pleasant when I first walked in and the cooks were quick to get the food started.  I had shrimp fried rice and it was to date the best I have had. Tasty, soft, not greasy, not a ton of junk in it, just perfect fried rice and the shrimp was cooked perfect, not overdone like so many. So good I tried it again 2 days later. We had vegetable egg foo young and sweet and sour shrimp.  Again the food is flavorful and tastes fresh, just the best chinese food I have had out of 4 others I have tried. Some were good but Jin Jin is now my go to."}
{"text":"I can only say that the service is fast and friendly, food is always good. Just wish the fried rice was a little better. Still my favorite take- out place!"}
{"text":"I don't quite get the hype that everybody else gives this place so far, but I'm a sucker for good cheap Americanized Chinese food.  So, they can still get the 4 stars.  When I say cheap, it isn't quite as cheap as some other places.  I think my lunch combo was like $6.50 and it wasn't a ton of food.  That is still super cheap in general, but not compared to my usual.  Chicken with mixed vegetables, extra spicy, no baby corn is always my first go to when I visit a place.  You get to see the actual pieces of chicken unlike something like general tso's.  It was good, but not great.  The sauce was a little bland.  The broccoli was certainly above what you would expect from \"cheap Chinese\", but nothing else really stood out.  Although I live 10 miles away, I like shopping at that Harris Teeter and don't always want Yoshi's grill.  So, I'll certainly be back to try more."}
{"text":"Simple but good sesame chicken. Large portion. Great broccoli and of course a ton of rice."}
{"text":"I stop by here for lunch today and was pleasantly pleased. The service was good, the food was very good and the egg rolls were actually crunchy (which I like). I definitely recommend Jin Jin's for quick and tasty Chinese take out."}
{"text":"Take note... Every time that I come here, the place is operationally clean! Some restaurant kitchens, show some sort of business about themselves. Where JinJin takes pride on cleaniness.  It shows in their greeting and in the quality of food! Taste??? Right on point. I gave it a 5 star, because of the just right portions, quality of preparedness, efficiency & price!"}
{"text":"We really were not expecting to find a good Chinese take out restaurant in NC after living in NJ most of our lives. The place is small but the staff is very friendly. I must say their food is as good as any we have found up north. A neighbor recommended them and we ordered  for Christmas Eve. Egg rolls, pork fried rice, boneless ribs, and general tso's chicken. All the food was cooked perfectly. We would recommend Jin Jin for anyone looking for good Chinese take out."}
{"text":"They are our go-to quick dinner! Best Chinese food we have been able to find in the Huntersville- north Charlotte area!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice and love it. It is convenient to where I work and the food is plentiful. I like the fact that I can see where they cook the food as the kitchen is even viewable from the front door."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of this Chinese restaurant. I visited it for the first time, wanting to try a new Chinese spot and ordered a sesame chicken lunch. The sesame chicken was the blandest sesame chicken I've had in my life. I didn't like it. Nor did I like the fried rice. I guess you would have to develop/acquire a taste for it but after eating at another Chinese place for years, I guess that's why I wasn't fond of it. However, the sesame chicken just really wasn't good to me. I'm pretty sure I won't return. I give it two stars because the associates were nice."}
{"text":"When I am looking for something cheap and delicious, I look to Jin Jin. The portions are large, the prices are small, and they still manage to use quality ingredients. I have an allergy to MSG, so Chinese food usually isn't the best option for me, but I never have any issues with food from Jin Jin.   Totally delicious, and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"I don't usually rate restaurants, however I read the reviews about Jin Jin and decided to give it a try.....so glad that I did.  Service was wonderful.  The young lady at the counter help me to make a decision about what to try.  One chef greeted me very happily.   This is the place I've been looking for since moving from NJ.  Food was good, service excellent and look forward to trying it again.  If you haven't tried this place, please do.  Think you'll enjoy it as much as I do."}
{"text":"It really is exactly what I would expect. Quick, inexpensive and pretty yummy Chinese take out. Nothing fancy, nothing extraordinary just decent take out."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in Huntersville area. The chicken chow mein is excellent. Great take out service."}
{"text":"Great authentic Take-out with a menu that includes all the take-out staples with a few extra dishes. Service was fast and friendly, the food was hot and plentiful and the steamed dumplings (my barometer for authenticity) were a tad smaller than I'm used to, BUT very flavorful and authentic."}
{"text":"This is essentially take out with a few tables. Ate here for lunch and thought the food was pretty good for the price! I tend to judge Chinese food by the number of weird meat parts ( that you discretely spit out) and this place had Zero!, so we'll be back. I didnt care for the egg drop soup. ( it was smooth with no veg or meat) and will try a different side next time."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome. Good hot food. General tso's is top notch. Definitely worth visiting. Great lunch stop"}
{"text":"Upon arrival you definitely feel you're not in HVille anymore. Reminds me of NJ/NYC just like how a previous reviewer noted. Menu is priced well. A ton of meat options with very little veggie options. Service is quick...call ahead or order for take-out. There are tables if you choose to eat there but it's not the best ambiance for eating in. I don't think it's THE BEST Chinese food in Huntersville, but it's the most convenient when you have your craving for cheap eats."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant after some grocery shopping and needed a quick meal to take home. Very fast and friendly service. Food portions are very large and everything we've had has been wonderful. Prices are good. Definitely will become our go to place for Chinese food!"}
{"text":"My family loves JinJin! Sweetest people that own it, they always take good care of us, and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about 5 years and the people are always nice and the food is good! We had an issue one time and they resolved it! I definitely suggest others to give them a shot!"}
{"text":"Wonton Soup8 Egg Roll 1 White Meat ($1-extra) Sesame Chicken 6/7 Roast Pork Fried Rice-5(tops) no pork  Scale 1-10 Big pluses  Very Clean                     Efficient and friendly Will go back for fills Chinese fix"}
{"text":"A no frills place that we frequent for to go food. Tasty, great prices and friendly staff. We will be customers here as long as they can keep the tasty Chinese food going! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good food. Typical American-Chinese food... General Tso's chicken was crispy and chicken with broccoli was very good. Better food than Dragon Express"}
{"text":"Ok food. Horrible customer service. Every time I call to place a order, the lady always rushes me off the phone. And this time, she actually hung up! Instead of saying bye or thank you- just CLICK in my ear. I like this place because it's close to my job, but if there was more competition in the area- I would go there in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating Chinese food and I've eaten in Philly & NYC and lived up there.  The food is ok for the price, but there are other places in Charlotte that's better. The 4 & 5 star is not justified. I'm being honest. The service was fast. Maybe it's because I was there at 11am & no one else was there.  I would like to recommend Wan Fu in Pineville. Their food is very good."}
{"text":"We stopped here later in the evening after our long drive to NC (May 3, 2014).  We ordered the sesame chicken with fried rice (came with an egg roll)  and a order of the fried pork wontons.  The sesame chicken wasn't as flavorful as the sesame chicken from back home but it was still good.  The pork wontons were slightly overcooked though.  The restaurant itself is more catered to take out only as they only had a couple of small tables to sit at (not good at all for larger groups).  It was a little harder to find as it was tucked in the back of a shopping center/plaza.  I took off a star for the overcooked wontons, other than that the food was pretty good from this place."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast. Cheap. Good service. What else would you want from Chinese takeout?"}
{"text":"A little too expensive on some items but decent Chinese fast food. I like the soups, lo mien, and fried rice :)"}
{"text":"I'm hooked. Finally!! Chinese that tastes like chinese food. Reasonably priced, fast take out and fresh food. I just regret it took me this long to find it."}
{"text":"The way they prepare their food is straight up nostalgic of my days in Brooklyn as a teen getting chicken wings and pork fried rice from the GOOD Chinese spot. Winner Winner. The place looks a little \"dumpy\" from outside but it is clean on the inside and they cook the food out in the open where you can see them. I need to visit them more often but my palette is not equipped for Chinese food that often. However this will be where I get it. Going back soon!!!"}
{"text":"First time at Jin Jin.  Service was friendly and the food was ready when they said it would be.  Located near the Publix behind the McDonald's.  Pretty much hidden from the main road.  Since I couldn't get a menu to come up online, I opted to look at some dated menus on Yelp.  I ordered a Roast Pork egg roll and pork won tons for our appetizer.  I probably wouldn't order the egg roll again but the won tons were decent.  I ordered small orders of the Sweet and Sour Chicken and the Chicken with Cashews.  Both were made with Chicken Breast and that is always a plus with us.  The Sweet and Sour Chicken was packed with the sauce on the side.  Kind of weird to open up a box of fried chicken pieces but it's better than soggy chicken.  There were no pieces of onion, bell peppers, or pineapples.  That's how I'm used to having Sweet and Sour Chicken but it was fine because my husband doesn't eat all of that anyways.  The Cashew Chicken was full of veggies and I liked it.   I will order from here again, can't wait to try something new next time."}
{"text":"My husband is one of the Navy Recruiters in the office next door so I tried this place by default, glad I did. I have had the Moo Goo Gai Pan, Sweet and Sour Chicken and a few other dishes. My favorite thing on their menu is the cream cheese wontons. If you try one thing there order the wontons."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food for various reasons, cleanliness being one of them. However this place seemed different. For starters they have an open kitchen where you can see everything they do which is always a good thing, and their ventilation system is great because we didn't leave there smelling like food.    The service is fast and the prices are reasonable. The food was perfect! It hasn't been easy finding authentic food here in North Carolina, but this is authentic Chinese food! The wonton soup was delicious! As was their pork fried rice. We also tried the dumplings and the spare ribs and we were not disappointed.   I would definitely return to fill my Chinese food cravings."}
{"text":"Reminded my husband and I of New York style Chinese food! They made our food very fast and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Tried Jin Jin based on the reviews that I saw here.  I was hopeful of the food and was somewhat disappointed.  Overall I thought that the food was ok.   Had the House Low Mein and General Taos Chicken.     The portions were a good size.  The overall flavor for both dishes was a little bland.   I wish that there was more flavor to the dishes.  I might try something different but may not be back."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! I spent $30 and really wanted to go get all of my money back. Shrimp Fried Rice had about 5 mini shrimp in the whole box, Shrimp egg roll had no shrimp in it, fried chicken tasted like it was fried two days prior, everything was horrible. Will not give this place a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"Food portions are small for price. They get 3 because it was clean and service nice. Food was just ok. Too pricey based on portions. Will keep looking for a place."}
{"text":"Consistently good take out Chinese food.  Jin Jin is located in the strip mall between BiLo and Mcdonalds.  They make great MeiFun noodles.  No complaints here"}
{"text":"Awesome service, very quick, great food, and friendly staff. It's my favorite Chinese take-out spot in the area. Lunch specials are a good deal as well. You get lots of food at a good price regardless."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food! I got the chicken with mixed vegetables extra spicy! Good, fresh tasting and decently priced."}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese restaurant in the Huntersville area. I generally order over the phone for pick up and the wait is never more than 20 minutes. My order is always correct and the food tastes great. The portions are very large. When I order a large chicken lo mein it's enough for two people to share! I also recommend their wonton soup. It's great!"}
{"text":"First time here. I have been trying to find a really good chinese place. I ordered Shrimp Fried Rice and Beef and Brocoli. The rice was hot and fresh but could use some more vegetables in it. I guess everyone makes it different. The Beef and Brocoli was hot and fresh with a lot of big pieces of Brocoli. Friendly service. Seemed pretty clean. Decor is okay. I still am looking may go  back later."}
{"text":"Excellent quick and cheap Chinese food. They are more than willing to adjust their dishes to your liking (e.g. they replace onions and peppers for carrots as broccoli for me)."}
{"text":"Nice people. Good food. They always get the order right. My wife sometimes gets a racing heart, but I think that's in her head. I would recommend Jin Jin."}
{"text":"People are nice. Place is clean and food is good. With the place being clean and food being sit down restaurant quality, it already puts this place ahead of a lot of take out restaurants.  But what makes it even better is it is actually reasonably priced! I love Chinese take out. This place just stands out as top in its class."}
{"text":"I love Jin-Jin! When we first moved here from NJ we missed good Chinese food, not anymore.  I've been a regular since they opened.  Great food at good prices.  Delicious!  Now, if only they delivered ..."}
{"text":"I don't eat Chinese take out very often, but this place is close to my house, cheap and fast...and the food is pretty descent. I always order the same thing ( vegetarian thin  rice noodles) and I'm always satisfied!!"}
{"text":"I love the food at Gin Gin.  Its a small place in a strip mall behind Wells Fargo.  I ordered the orange chicken, fried rice and won ton soup.  Dont let the size of the restaurant fool you, they consistantly turn out some of the tastiest New York style chinese food.  My food was cooked to order right in front of me.   My orange chicken was not too spicy, which is just how I ordered it.  I will definitely be back again!  very good food for the cost."}
{"text":"Standard fare Chinese, however, custom made to my taste. I has the Chicken with mixed vegetables made spicy. It was cooked fresh and served hot!  The restaurant is small, only 5 tables but very clean. The staff was friendly and quick. The meals are served in plastic bowls with plastic ware, I prefer to get glass plates and silverware.   The food was delicious and I would go back again."}
{"text":"Food quality is very consistent.  Always really good!  Customer service is on point. Only took 10 min to get my food for 2 people."}
{"text":"Good NY style Chinese food! I recently tried this place and was very happy with the price, value, and taste. I ordered a dinner combo of the crispy scallion chicken - it was tasty, came with fried rice and an egg roll, and it was made to go relatively quickly! Based on the one visit, I would recommend! As of now, I do like NY restaurant more(in Cornelius), BUT I will take one for the team and keep trying this place again, and again, and again!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the portions were larger than I had anticipated.  Even our kids enjoyed the meal and that speaks volumes!!!"}
