{"text":"The mutter paneer is really good. We ordered extra naan, the portions are large, there was enough for two people with one order. They make it fresh right there.  The prices are great. The owners are very nice."}
{"text":"Had great take out from here. Ordered aloo tiki (potato patties with Chana), samosa, naan, and curry chicken. Wasn't greasy at all. Naan was amazing and huge. Chicken curry was full of big chunks of meat and the appetizer aloo tiki was really good. I work in Brampton with lots of authentic places around and while this was def more $$, it was super tasty and just as authentic! Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food and service. My favourite so far is vegetable biryani as it's very flavourful and not too unhealthy. Haven't tried the butter chicken but it was cooking hen I came in and it smelled AMAZING. Big portion sizes and very cheap prices.In Toronto, you would easily pay double. They cook the food to order with an exposed kitchen so everything is made fresh and with care."}
{"text":"If you live in Georgetown and get serious butter chicken cravings like I do, just go here. One could definitely argue that it's a little pricy compared to its Brampton competitors, but their naans are super good, their butter chicken is up to standard, and the staff is friendly. One complaint is that the wait time can drag sometimes and several times they have done a poor job bringing everything out at the same. I once recieved my butter chicken a good 10 minutes before receiving anything to eat with it (rice, naan). Also their samosas are sometimes still cold in the center. That aside I do love eating here. Great portion sizes too."}
{"text":"Small simple place, family run. Food is amazing.  We've eaten Indian many places including Brampton but this place rivals the best. We were here late and the only patrons. We could tell it was all made on demand. They even tailored the spice for our kids. Ordered butter chicken, Aloo Tikki, Aloo Gobi, Naan and Basmati rice. Fed four with leftovers. Thanks to past reviews. We found a simple but tasty gem. Will be back."}
{"text":"We love Namaste Mo Mo - they have fish and chips for the the less adventurous eater, but we go there for the fantastic and fresh Indian.  The butter chicken and palaak paneer are so good, make sure to get a serving of rice to go along.  Each serving feeds at least two people so we will eat for about three meals each for two of us (for less than $30).  Reheats great in the oven - maybe even get an extra naan or two (also made fresh).  The ambiance is not fantastic (really a fish and chip shop environment), so we usually take it home.  Call ahead to order take out, or arrive and order for take out and have a beer next door at the Pint and Paddle."}
{"text":"Order: Butter chicken, Aloo Gobi, samosa, naan and basmati rice.   Let me start by saying I have had a lot of Indian food from a lot of places in the GTA and this place is amazing.  The butter chicken had a good proportion of meat to gravy and it was very flavorful. Rich flavor without being overly oily. Same for the samosa. I've had many samosas that taste good but are a mess to eat because all the filling comes out when you eat it. Would definitely recommend checking them out. We look forward to going back to try more of their dishes"}
{"text":"Great all around! Super kind staff, fast to make the food, and food is DELICIOUS! Mmm  Love that there entire menu can be ordered for take out!"}
