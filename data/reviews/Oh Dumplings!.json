{"text":"Great dumpling usually busy place , some times waiting can be 1/2 hr. Pork dumpling are the best one"}
{"text":"Try to avoid this dumpling restaurant if you can. We had 8 people but there is no 8-people table. The cashier (boss) said we need to assemble the tables if we wanted to stay. My friends didn't want to change, so we stayed. The food was average and I would never go back given that there are so many choices nearby."}
{"text":"If I could put 0 stars I would.  terrible service, overpriced, shitty food, and small portions.  With far better dim sum places right around the corner you would think they would be motivated to compete.  The branding and logo makes it look interesting, but that is where it ends.  The waiters are barely interested to help.  We watched several tables have to get their own cutlery and yell to get the waiters attention,,, and it wasn't busy at all.

I am almost convinced it is a front, because no one seems to care about the food or the service."}
{"text":"Great dumplings. I was impressed. Visiting from Vancouver, it was a treat to stumble across this place."}
{"text":"We went to Oh Dumplings in Chinatown (1050 Rue Clark) this Sunday with our three year old son. We order two orders of dumplings and one fried vegetable balls. Unfortunately my son refused to eat the dumplings nor the fried vegie balls, typical 3 year old kid for you. I went to the store next door and bought him a couple of steamed buns and brought them back to the restaurant. As I started feeding him the steamed bun, one waitress came to our table and said outside food is not allowed here. I was very apologetic, and explained we only did it because my son refused to eat. I asked if she could make an exception. By the way, I completely understand the policy, and they have all the right to disallow outside food. On the other note, I was hoping they could make an exception given the circumstances, even though I would have accepted it if the answer was no. As the conversation was taken place, our waiter (the one who took our order) passed by and asked what was going on. I explained him the situation, and he said \"it's ok\". I thanked him and we continued our meal. When we finished our lunch, my husband went to pay and we left a 20% tip, we were grateful they allowed my son to eat his bun. As we were leaving, my husband mentioned that it was pricy, the dumplings. So I asked him to show me the bill. My husband then said he didn't get a bill. I decided to ask for the bill at the counter. The waitress was caught off guards, as she did not even print the bill. So I waited for her to print bill. As I was waiting, our waiter (the same waiter who said it was OK to eat) came to me and handed me over the tips we left, and said \"you don't have to leave a tip, it's included\". I was surprised, and asked why the tip was included.  He answered \"we charged you for eating outside food\". I was shocked. \"But didn't you tell me it was OK to eat?\" He answered \"Even if I said it was not OK you would have continued anyways\". I was speechless. I said \"You have to inform me about the penalty or whatever you called it. You can't charge me without telling me. What percentage is it? 15%?\" It turns out, they charged us 30% service charge. Had we not inquired about the bill, we would have never found out their unethical and dishonest practice. What a shame."}
{"text":"OK food but very bad service. Watch out the bill, it comes with tip included, even when you are not satisfied with service. We ordered four dishes, three of them arrived on time but one never showed up. After waiting for 40min past we got our three dishes, our friend who ordered the fourth dish could not wait and had to cancel it."}
{"text":"simply fresh & delicious! Very generous portions and reasonable prices. Super casual but hey it's chinatown"}
{"text":"It was delicious!!! we ordered the general tao , fried rice, and the pork and coriander dumplings and chicken and chinese cabbage. It was All really good!! Good service , clean and good quality food!!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Food was absolutely HORRIBLE. Went here for vacation with my girlfriend. And they microwave our fried shrimp and served it to us. The food was way too greasy and got my girlfriend sick!!! Advoid!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is just what we were looking for. Food arrives HOT and the quality is fantastic.  We had the Spring Rolls, Chicken fried noodles, 2 types of Dumplings and Lamb skewers.  That was more than enough for the 4 of us.  We would go again."}
{"text":"We were at Chinatown and stopped in for some dumplings. The dumplings were made fresh but lack varieties. As for the service, this place is bad. We were shopping and walked in with what we bought from the bakery nearby. Two waiters came by and said no outside food allowed.  We weren't eating the baked goods but were looking at them. Telling us once was enough but twice, come on! We ordered tripe salad, chicken dumplings, and pork dumplings. The dumplings were great but their dipping sauce sucks for dumplings...on the table were soy sauce, black vinegar, and chile oil. No fresh grated gingers and red vinegar dipping like other dumplings houses. 

When we paid the bill and started to walk out, the waiter stopped us and said tips not included in our bill. We left tips on the table. We always tip no matter what, if your service was good, it'll be more than 15%. No water refill, no coming by to ask if we needed anything else and yet told us tip is not included in our bill. If I was the owner, I would retrained my staffs to let the service speaks for itself if you want tips."}
{"text":"Pretty decent dumplings. The pork, shrimp and coriander one was what I got. For about $12, I got 15 large dumplings that constituted a light meal (I'm a pig, so I also had some pho down the street to supplement).

I found it kind of pricey, but.... *shrug*

I felt satisfied, the vinegar was delicious with the dumplings, the dough was rolled out fresh (I stood there and watched her), and it was steamed very nicely.

I found that the dumplings were also decent because you could actually taste some small chunks of shrimp in there, unlike some other places where they mince and mash it up so you don't even know what you're eating.

That said, aside from the sauce (which I am certain I can buy), I make better dumplings at home even if my wrappers are store bought and frozen and not as good or as fresh. My filling is infinitely better because I put more chunks of shrimp and pork, with water chestnuts.... but for a quick light meal, $12 is a decent price. 

I have yet to try the other dumpling place everyone is raving about (Mai something or another), so this review may change.

Update: Go to Mai Xiang Yuan instead just around the corner. The filling is better (more thicker pieces of shrimp) and much cheaper."}
{"text":"I was not impressed.  I ordered several different dishes to get a good taste of it and nothing tasted up to par.  Perhaps spending time in Chinatown in several cities and Flushing New York has raised my standards, but I would expect Chinatown in Montreal to complete with those places.

I ordered spinach dumplings and they were tasteless.  I couldn't even get a dip together to add flavor."}
{"text":"My mom and I wanted a bit of a snack and thought dumplings would be a great thing to get. We ordered the pork and vegetable and shrimp as well as the chicken and cabbage. I also got a boba tea (almond) and my mom got a diet Coke. The place was pretty packed when we sat down, and ordered. The food came out in a pretty normal pace, and they were awesome!y only complaint of this place is the bathroom was so gross.... Clean then bathrooms guys!!! 

Was super cool to see the ladies making the dumplings thru the glass! Wod come here again for sure."}
{"text":"I m a big fan of dumplings and was excited by the name it self \"oh Dumplings \".They have lots of options in dumpling apart from other main course food n soups which I may try in my next visit. Decent , clean place. they have lots of options .... I had coriander chicken dumplings and it was good ... But cud have had more chicken stuffed than coriander and other vegetables. Quantity is quite a lot .... Will still recommend this place"}
{"text":"The food was GREAT, and the portions were generous. If I was writing this review based solely on the quality of the food, I would rate it a four or five star restaurant.

However, after our experience this weekend, I have to say that I am not impressed with the wait staff.

No one came to greet us; someone pointed to a table as we entered and otherwise we had to sit and wait a few minutes for menus and water. The restaurant was half empty. When we tried to order any kind of drinks, the waiter, at first, tried to tell us that they were out (of beer, and coke, which REALLY seemed fishy) until I tried to order a bubble tea and he said \"No, drink water. We're too busy to bring drinks right now.\" Okay well, that's a loss on their part, but we were a little confused considering half of the tables were empty.

We were hungry and decided to shrug it off. When it was finally my turn to order, I tried to order their fried potato pancake, and was told, once more, that they were too busy and that it took too long to make, so they weren't serving that today. Frustrated, I flipped through the menu to try to find something else to order...

...and the waiter smacked my shoulder because I was taking too long to find something to eat, after being told twice in a row that I couldn't order what I wanted because they were too busy.

I don't care who you are, or how busy your restaurant is at that moment, but there is NEVER a reason to touch your customer, let alone smacking them and telling them that they're taking too long to order. It didn't hurt, but it was incredibly rude, and needless to say, none of us left a big tip.

The food was really the only shining star in this place; the dumplings that I ended up ordering were absolutely delicious, as was the chicken that my friend ordered. If it wasn't for how rude, pushy and inattentive the waiter was, we would have had an awesome experience. Hopefully it's a little less restrictive on a quieter night!"}
{"text":"A restaurant specialized making dumplings should excel what they do. The dumpling I had was just mediocre. Dry wrap with losing fillings. I expect they come in with hot steam so I can sense the freshness right from the start. But unfortunately they came in warm and soon get cold when dipping the vinegar. Like microwaved packaged foods don't hold the heat long.

I would very much like to tip more if it wasn't a walk-up self pay system. Which I waited in a line with 3 people ahead. The frontdest is in the middle of the restaurant so you have to stand there to wait which is really uncomfortable to me. And This is the first only restaurant who has asked me for tip in French."}
{"text":"Sooo good. Just ate there an hour ago and I'm craving more already!  My partner and I shared a couple plates of spinach and mushroom, and pork and shrimp dumplings.  They were deee-ricious!  The service wasn't great, nor was the space, but the location was nice.  
I'll be looking for a good dumpling place when I get back to Vancouver!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  I found it walking through Chinatown earlier this afternoon. The staff was professional and helpful. I ordered the beef and coriander and the chicken and Chinese cabbage dumplings (steamed). I also had a spring roll. Everything was very good and the portions were generous. 

I think one of my favorite things about this place was the layout. On one side of the restaurant is a prep area where they are making the dumplings. Great concept! 
 
Good value. I would return with friends. 

No free wifi. 

Bottom line: Oh Dumplings! Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"Good dumplings, good price, good and friendly  service, nice ambiance. We were satisfied.We tried Chinese and Molson beers. Molson seemed better."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming dumplings.  We ordered the vegetarian and the pork/cabbage dumplings and they were ok.  We were missing a few dumplings and it took them 30 minutes to give them to us.  Also, the sesame noodles are very bland.  This was disappointing dumpling experience!"}
{"text":"Not my ideal dumpling spot- more fast food. I came around 5 pm as a party of two. Service was kind of slow -as we were waiting around quite a bit of time before we were actually served- only because I flagged down the waitress. 


Dumplings are served in dishes of 15 - fried or boiled. They don't come in a bamboo dish- but on a plate so they become cold fairly quickly! They also have a selection of appetizers and hot dishes.
Prices were $$.

We ordered: (rating on 5*) 
lamb and coriander dumplings***, pork, shrimp and vegetable dumplings **(seasoning was off), Chinese crepes- comes in 6 pieces/greasy **, salt and pepper shrimp** (too salty for my taste).
For dipping sauces- they had chilli, soya and dumpling sauce (balsamic vinegar type). 

You pay at the cash and get a fortune cookie!  This is more a good \"I don't want McDonalds\" option."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation. I love dumplings and this place has them in packs of 15..yup you get 15 dumplings in a dish.. Awesome! In addition to dumplings there is a wide selection of Chinese food. Located in the middle of china town the food is delicious! The food came out quick and didn't really have anything bad to say. I preferred the fried dumplings to the steamed ones which if I were you I would poke them first to let the steaming hot water out, which was collected in the dumpling when it was cooked."}
{"text":"Pro tip: Order the fish dumplings. I don't know what the juice is that's in it, but it's tangy and sweet and so tasty. We didn't finish all 15 (because we ordered other things) and took the leftovers back to our hotel fridge, but I still ate them cold the following mornings just cause it was so good and I don't care. Just the best fish (or any animal-filled) dumplings I've ever had at a restaurant. Otherwise, this place is your standard fare. I'm just giving it four stars because of those dreamy dumplings alone.
I see you little Asian ladies rolling them out behind the glass. I want to be a part of your world. I want you to roll the fish dumplings like an assembly line into my mouth. You and I can work together, so I can live my best dumpling life and you can get paid and put your children through college on my money.
Oh, dumplings. Oh."}
{"text":"Quick service. Open kitchen where dumplings are made and other area of kitchen is behind closed doors. We got the spicy szechuan chicken. Did not say on the menu it was \"bone in\"...we found out the hard way. It was delicious chicken but would have been nice to know that going in. 

Also got the pork and shrimp dumplings and they were delicious. 

Giving this place 3 stars because the public restroom was nastiest thing I'd ever seen in all my life. I don't know that the toilet had ever even been cleaned. The floor was disgusting and there were used paper towels overflowing out of the trash can all over the small dirty floor. It was too much and I felt I'd lost my appetite after being in there."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Place wasn't to busy after lunch. Cool watching the two skilled ladies make the dumplings with ease.   Unfortunately maybe the worst service ever after being seated and out order placed every one but the dumpling makers were on there cell phones and clearly more interested in those conversations."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a whim and bit were we happy when we left! The dumplings were amazing--fresh, juicy and perfectly pan fried. We also had the beef brisket soup and the spicy cold noodle salad. Both were excellent and I would recommend them. However, be warned, the noodles are very spicy. 

The service was good--the waitress was attentive, but didn't hover. We will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Great place for Dumplings! 
It's our 3rd time and we like the place more and more..
Simply Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh dumplings, good service, looks clean. Nothing spectacular. Decent food. We went there for lunch. The hot pot place (little fat sheep) is a better option if you want to try Chinese food in the area."}
{"text":"On a nos habitudes chez Oh Dumplings! On y passe au moins 2 fois par mois pour y déguster les délicieux dumplings faits sur place dans la petite cuisine ouverte sur la salle. Celle ci contrairement à beaucoup de restos du quartier est grande, lumineuse, moderne et confortable. 
Les dumplings sont delicieux, surtout rôtis à la poèle et malgré la récente augmentation de prix, restent quand même raisonnables. 
La qualité du service est variable et surtout anglophone ce qui n'enlève rien à l'expérience.
On y retourne avec plaisir."}
{"text":"Oh Dumplings... Oh I adore thee. Let me count the ways: 1, 2, 3... Great boiled dumplings and lots of them. I ordered three different types: spinach, chicken and cabbage, and pork and shrimp - thinking we would get the normal 6 each. Try 12 each! Yums!"}
{"text":"Bof le service reste à désirer vraiment et les dumplings de sont pas si bons beaucoup trop pour une personne mais viennent seulement par 15."}
{"text":"Oh Dumpling ce sont des dumplings, du poulet General Tao croustillant à souhait, quelques spécialités asiatiques, et du bubble tea.
Une salle de restaurant sans charme mais les dumplings sont fait maison à la main et devant vos yeux. \"L'atelier\" est derrière une vitre visible par tous! (je trouve ça plutôt rassurant!) Certainement pas les meilleurs de Montréal mais pas mauvais pour autant! Ils proposent également à la vente pour emporter des dumplings congelés pour faire à la maison!
A essayer au moins une fois, pour changer de votre restaurant Dumplings préféré, et comparez..."}
{"text":"I was starving and in the mood to have dim sum or some sort. The service was kind of slow even when it was just me in the restaurant. Dumplings were expensive and served in dishes of 15 - fried or steamed, and it was served on a plate so they got cold fairly fast. Lastly, the dumplings were pretty bland. No repeat visit for me."}
{"text":"The dumplings here are okay but nothing special. You can mix and match at a cost. I'm not from Montreal but for boiled dumplings I prefer Qing hua."}
{"text":"Was looking for a quick lunch spot around Chinatown and came across Oh Dumplings so we decided to go in and give it a try. It wasn't too busy when we arrived so we got a table right away. It took a bit of time before we got menus and water. Service was not attentive. Looking at the menu, I was a bit disappointed in the lack of pan-fried dumplings which are usually my favorite. 

We ordered a variety of dumplings dishes including the \"pork, vegetable and shrimp dumplings which were $10.99 for 15 pieces and we decided to order it fried for an extra $1.50 as I loved fried dumplings. The fried dumplings were nice and crispy packed with juicy flavours. We also ordered the \"Spinach, mushroom and cabbage dumplings for $9.99 for 15 pieces- this one was steamed. A staple at any dumplings establishment is to get their green onion pancake which we did- pretty decent amount and nicely cooked. A dish I would not recommend would be the pork meat rolled in dried bean curd- I thought it was overly salty and wasn't very good. 

Overall, a decent place for lunch. Definitely stick to the dumplings here as they are quite good. Would definitely come back for another visit and try their other dumplings!"}
{"text":"I had the Lamb Dumplings & they are amazing & there homemade chili oil with soy is also really good.Service is fast & friendly OH YA to OH Dumplings"}
{"text":"First time patron. Hot sour soup was too vinegary. Steamed spinach dumplings were very bland. Asked to have it pan fried. Neither that or the soy sauce saved it. Including ingredients like cilantro, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts or slivered ginger would have helped it. Given the name of the restaurant, \"not\" a lot of dumpling options to choose from. The plate of stir fried vegetable was also bland and more like chop suey. The service was fast and pleasant. There \"may\" be other items on the menu that have better flavor. The food was relatively inexpensive but too bland for my liking. If you looking for good Chinese food, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Want some good Chinese dumplings that mixes the classic Chinese with the modern then Oh Dumpling! : place to go. Unlike other Montreal Chinatown restaurants it doesn't do that bull with lanterns and Chinese mock decor but goes to the heart of Chinese foods, hand made noodle soups, good quality dumplings , and some relaxing Chinese food. This is the place to go - beef brisket noodles, dumplings , yup this place has got it and the flavor matches that of China , hats off to them."}
{"text":"Its a bit pricey but the dumplings and service are good."}
{"text":"Stumbled into the place as we were visiting Montreal and decided we wanted Pho or Soup dumplings.  Lost out internet once we left our hotel so we couldn't use yelp to find the best place.  We loved this place.  Our waiter was awesome.  We have a daughter who is allergic to Sesame(yes I know, bad idea to bring her to Chinatown) but the service there was great and they were so kind and made sure that all of the food was safe. The dumplings that we ordered were amazing and my other daughters beef stew soup was to die for. This restaurant is a really great place to eat at when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Oh Dumplings! is Montreal's newest dumpling venue attempting to wrestle the top spot from Mai Xiang Yuan. 

Rather large and situated in a fairly good location right on Clark, the decor is new and even decent with a pseudo open kitchen and big windows letting in tons of light.  Everything seemed pretty clean, but that could have just been the fact that it is new. Only time will tell.

It appears as though they've given some thought to marketing and branding.  They already have a website and according to the QR codes and Icons plastered on the front door they are all over the Web 2.0 sites including Yelp. Sadly with a quick review of their menu it's apparent that their marketing budget didn't include a spell checker.  They could have gotten a bit more creative with the food photos. From the outside dumplings look more or less the same, so the single isolated dumplings seemed a bit silly to me.

A nice try I suppose with all the marketing collateral, but restaurant's need to also consider service and of course the food.  Other reviewers seemed to have problems with the service, but I found it OK.  Granted we were the only customers at the time. By the end of the meal I could have used more water but all in all that's about par for the course in Montreal.

Finally, on to the food. When I glanced at the prices I seriously considered walking out and just going to Mai Xiang Yuan.  Expect to pay two or three dollars more per dish than the aforementioned restaurant.  Others mentioned the rather thick skin on the dumplings and yeah they are some thick skins.  I've eaten a lot of dumplings both here and in China and never have I had dumplings with such thick skin.  

To their credit, each dumpling was absolutely stuffed with filling.  It was a sickeningly sweet filling unfortunately.  I can only guess that they've made the filling a bit sweet in an attempt to cater to Western palates, but it sort of ruined them for me. Tellingly I actually left a couple dumplings on the plate, I just couldn't stomach any more dough or sweet filling.

Clearly somebody poured a bucket load of money into establishing a brand. Unfortunately they spent way too much time fiddling with the marketing and not nearly enough time nailing down the food.  Hands down Mai Xiang Yuan has better dumplings at better prices. Oh Dumplings! has a lot of work to do if they want to be a serious contender in the Montreal dumpling wars."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty nice overall. Oh! Dumplings is a nice place to eat at when exploring Montreal's China Town. While the dumplings aren't the best ever, they're really good and is worth trying. The cleanliness is really good, considering the many unhygienic areas of China Town there are. The other food besides dumplings need some work, however. I absolutely loved the steamed, pork dumplings! Though, I could've done without the appetizers. Besides that, the main point is the restaurant is a good place to eat and you will most likely be satisfied. Try new things! The sky's the limit! Remember, you're on Yelp for a reason;)"}
{"text":"Not very good. Friendly staff.
We may have gotten unlucky, however the food was really not good such that I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Their fried dumpling on quite a bit more on the greasier side, and all their dumplings has a slight but noticeable chemical flavoring taste to it to the point is they are slightly bitter (pork with coriander, pork with cabbage, spinach and chicken). They also don't taste very fresh. 

However their spinach dumpling looks very pretty, the service is decent."}
{"text":"Terrible! They served us reheated dumplings. There was a lady pretending to assemble dumplings but she was just placing the dumplings in a platter. 
I will never come back here."}
{"text":"Il faut l'avouer leurs dumplings sont excellents même divins mais leur choix est assez limité. De plus lors de notre visite, 2 des variétés de dumpling que nous avons commandés étaient \"out of stock\" ( bon signe ils sont populaires mais c'est un peu ironique d'en manquer autant alors que c'est leur spécialité...) Le reste du menu ne vaut pas la peine d'essayer ( très grosse déception / pas mangeable). Quant au service, il y a définitivement place à amélioration."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon. No reservations required. 
Had lamb coriander and shrimp, pork, vegetables dumplings. Enjoyed both. 
Also had the hot and sour soup which wasn't great but nice enough. Bit too eggy for my taste. Lychee bubble tea was nice enough though. 
Ambience was a bit off but I guess that's because we went there at 9pm on a Tuesday night. Place closes at 10. But we enjoyed our food. 
Not bad for occasional visits or dumpling cravings :P"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place in MTL with good quality frozen dumplings for quite some time now. Almost for the better part of seven years. You see folks I've bought so many freaking dumplings at Asian grocery stores but none of them live up to expectation. Their mediocrity and mass produced taste bored my taste buds. Until one day I was roaming around Chinatown. I walked by here and saw they had frozen dumplings to go. It peaked my curiosity. So I performed a test with 45 dumplings (3 orders of 15 pork n chive $6.99 for 15) to go. My results were I came back here and picked up a mother load more. 120 total. It was around $60 for 120. A bit expensive but they are bloody amazing. I'm a bit cautious as I didn't want to share my little secret but the dumplings are amazing. I'm shocked at how good they are for frozen ones that I don't even steam. I boil them in water. 

For the 120 I bought three varieties:

Pork & Chinese cabbage $6.99/15
Beef coriander $7.99/15
Fish & coriander $8.99/15

The Pork and cabbage are my fave but the fish and coriander are amazingly fresh and tasty also. The beef and coriander are good but not as good as the others. These are the tastiest - juiciest frozen dumplings I've found here in MTL. Before my brother would schlepp frozen dumplings from this place in Chinatown Calgary for me. No more. 

One funny point to add. When I came in for 45 they put in a styrofoam container. So I came back with big ziplock freezer bags for the 120 which work much better. A minor inconvenience but it shows me they don't sell many frozen lol!"}
{"text":"Oh Dumplings caught my attention due to a menu that emphasized dumplings, and dumplings was something I wanted after a long drive to Montreal. After staring at the menu of this restaurant (posted outside) for a long time, my family and I decided to try out this place, not having high standards since we know Montreal Asian food isn't comparable to Markham's.

To make our stay a little easier on ourselves in terms of our standards, we focused on what made this restaurant famous: the dumplings. We had a large plate of beef and coriander dumplings, as well as lamb and coriander dumplings. Eventually we added more plates such as orange fish and crispy chicken.

The beef and coriander dumplings were actually very good! There was a good balance of beef and coriander inside, and you can see the chefs making the dumplings in the restaurant (they steam/pan-fry the dumplings in the kitchen before bringing them out). I eventually ordered another plate due to how good it was. The lamb and coriander dumplings were decent, but not as good as the beef ones. The other dishes were mediocre for the most part, and I can tell from the crowd this place attracts the western crowd more than the Asian crowd, tourists aside.

Service was poor. We had to ask someone for water/tea to be delivered, and they were delivered in glass cups instead of teacups. We also had to ask the waiter a couple of times for water refills. Finally, the cashier lineup took way too long, as the cashier seemed to be not too knowledgeable on how to deal with potential customer conflicts (there was one during my time in the restaurant).

I don't think I'll return, as I had better food experiences in the Chinatown area during my time in Montreal."}
{"text":"So impressed with the service and the long list of choices on the menu! If you are looking for food and a show, look no further, too. You can watch your dumplings being made at the back of the restaurant as you wait to eat.

Very healthy portion sizes (15 dumplings per order) and you can get them boiled or fried. There is an upcharge for fried however and also if you want to mix a couple kinds into your order - the reason for the 4 out of 5 stars. Lots of traditional flavours and there is rice wine vinegar on every table, to allow appropriate soaking of your dumplings when they get to the table"}
{"text":"Le menu est constitué d'excellents dumplings! C'est un très bon rapport qualité-prix!

Si vous y allez en couple ou entre amis, je vous conseille de prendre chacun un plat différent (autant frits qu'à vapeur) et de vous les partager, l'expérience en vaut encore plus la peine.

À moins de 10$ pour 15 dumplings, c'est un resto valeur"}
{"text":"The place is properly named.  While they have menu items besides dumplings, you should really only go here for dumplings.  We order Pork and cabbage dumplings, which were very good.  We also ordered a Seafood noodle soup, which appeared to include frozen shrimp that was cooked separately, resulting in soup that lacked seafood flavor.  The other dish we ordered was the Beef Curry, which was perhaps the most mild and bland curry I recall having.  It was edible, but neither of those would be ordered again.  But, if you want dumplings, it's a good choice.

The service was very good.  Our waitress started speaking in French, switched to English when I looked confused, and conversed in Mandarin when we (and by we, I don't me mean) placed our order in Mandarin.  Tri-lingual wait staff  should help make sure almost anyone can order.  Service was quick."}
{"text":"Tasty dumplings and nice variety. Not so much English speakers, or daft beers."}
{"text":"I usually go for take out dumplings from work, but sometimes, I go in the restaurant, to have a delicious time there.

There is a lot of action because there are lots of customers and orders, that come and go, so for sure the food is fresh.

So far I've been able to discover their great selection of dumplings, the hot and sour soup, and potato salad. 

There is so much more to discover from their menu.


They serve water but there is a small variety of asian beers along with the usual soft drinks.

A suggestion would be to be able to pay to the server and not only the cashier, especially when the place is crowded.....

If you go there during the week, on lunch time, the place can be quite crowded and loud, many workers go for their lunch until around 1h15 PM where they miraculosly vanish; otherwise, the place is ideal to go and \"chill\" with friends or a significant other."}
{"text":"Oh Dumplings is located right in Chinatown. Our server was friendly and the service was quite fast. We ordered some fried vegetable balls, and some dumplings. In comparison to Qing Hua, which is just a couple blocks away, the size of their dumplings was quite small. They didn't have much flexibility in how it's cooked either, so they just came out as boiled (cost an extra $1.50 for them to be pan-fried). Overall, I found the place just average."}
{"text":"We liked it here and rating based on what we ordered for lunch.  Pork cabbage dumplings served 15 per order is enough to share for 2-3 people.  Hand made in plain view of the dining room so you know it's fresh.  None in our order were broken or leaking the tasty juices.
The beef stew noodles was really good...neatly arranged ingredients presented the big bowl very nicely.  When in Chinatown, don't hesitate to stop in."}
{"text":"It was cold and rainy late easter night during our vacation to old montreal. Happened to find this place. We ordered pork and chive dumplings and pork and shrimp dumpings with chinese beer. It was very filling and delicious. Even though it was 45 mins before closing, they didn't rush us but instead male server was very responsive and friendly. We ordered an extra pork and chives dumplings before we left along with our leftover."}
{"text":"I have been here for 3 times. I tried the fried veggi-ball. I like it. It has little salt or other spices so I dipped them in the hot sauce. The fried breaded pork rice is good too. My favorite is the fish dumpling. I recommend it to all if you don't hate coriander."}
{"text":"We were hungry after walking around all day so we decided to stop in here for a quick snack. Menu was extensive enough to choose different kinds of food if you can't decide on just one item. We had steamed dumplings with pickled cucumbers which came out fairly quick.

The dumplings were good and fulfilling to fill two people. Although, people around us were ordering a plate of dumplings just for themselves. Food was decent price too so come check out this place if you're hungry."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée quelques fois et je n'ai jamais été déçue! La nourriture et le service est bon. Je ne pense pas que ce sont les meilleurs dumplings en ville mais il sont très décent. J'adore leur soupes et le général Tao est également bon.

I went a few times and I have never been disappointed! The food and service is good. I do not think these are the best dumplings in town but they are very decent. I love their soups and General Tao is also good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch.  Was  impressed by the cleanliness which is not typical of a majority of restaurants in Montreal's Chinatown.  Although it was not overly busy, 2 servers and 4 tables with customers, I had to wait almost 15 minutes before my server made eye contact and came over to the table to take my order.  Had the fried vegetables appetizer and beef with coriander pan-fried dumplings for my main.  The veggies were a little overdone and when the dumplings came almost 5 minutes after I had finished my veggies, I thought finally and was moderately impressed.  After finishing , I walked up to the counter to pay and the server looked at me like he didn't recognize me.  I could have walked out and not paid but I took great satisfaction in telling him I wanted to pay my bill. Not bad but not that great either."}
{"text":"I'm not from Montreal, but judging from the dishes and the clientele, I think this place might cater more to Western palates than traditional Chinese cuisine, which would be okay except their menu and restaurant layout lead you to think it would be more like a traditional dumpling house. 

//Atmosphere\\
Since it's on a corner, the space gets plenty of natural light. When you walk in, the space looks airy and clean, and they seem to get business. The overall service and feel is a modernly furnished Hong Kong Cha Chan Teng.

//Food\\
It was passable for what it was, but if you knew what the dishes are like elsewhere, then it was disappointing. Dumplings are boiled, if you want them pan fried it's $1.50 extra. The sauce and vinegar provided are very weak, they don't help the bland and watery taste of boiled dumplings at all. I ordered the salt and pepper squid, but instead of squid stir fried in salt and black pepper (what it normally is), what arrived was squid in some kind of sweet and sour sauce with red and green peppers. All dumplings are jiaozi/gao ji style dumplings (thick white wrappers). So dumpling noodle soup is wonton noodles in broth with jiaozi  rather than wontons (thin yellow wrappers). Overall taste is okay for some dishes.

//Service\\
When we came, there were two ladies making dumplings, a girl behind the cash counter, and two waiters. Neither of the waiters ever looked busy. Except at the beginning when they first pour your water, they never refill your cup nor come by to check up on you. They spent most of their time hanging out at their stations and talking to each other. If you needed anything, you had to flag them down. As far as I could tell, they never brought anyone their check. You had to go up to the counter so the girl could tally your total up while trying to decipher their chicken scratch."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice. We ordered pork dumplings and it was packed with flavors. The spinach dumplings were very bland, the noodle soup was on a bland side too. The pancakes were light, crispy & delicious!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best dumplings I have ever eaten! We stumbled on this place while wondering through the Chinese quarter and were impressed by the quality of our meal. I had the beef tenderloin curry hot bowl, which was fantastic.  We also split an app of the shrimp, pork and vegetable dumplings. They were amazing,  and you got so many. Great quality food, super reasonably priced.  This place has ruined me for Chinese takeout forever."}
{"text":"It's a cheap place where you can get your lunch quickly, even when it's busy. Their dumplings are good and their soups are okay. The service is okay. It may have a better ambiance during dinner time, but lunch time it can get a little bit crowded."}
{"text":"Great Chinese style food and 'English' style service. 

The wife and I tried the fried crepes as well as the beef and pork dumplings. A fair for food and delicious.  Try the papaya bubble tea as well. A great experience all around."}
{"text":"Extremely bad service and disgusting dumplings!!
Super thick skin and use froze fillings.
Called the costumer cheap for trying to take away left overs and hangs up on the costumer as well.
Strongly suggest you do not go there unless you want to be yelled at and called cheap by the server! Or unless you do not want to have the right to take away your left overs."}
{"text":"While on our vacation I finally pried my duaghter away from fast food long enough to get some Chinese food. Montreal's Chinatown is compact but full of some really good places. There are dozens of options on these streets but she liked the menu here. It was in Chinese, French, & English. She read the options and decided that this was the place for her.

The waitstaff all seem to be multilingual. That helped. My daughter was feeling a bit sad about her lack of French, even though most people will switch into English when they realize you don't understand.

First we split an order of Shallot Pancakes, and they were quite tasty. I ordered salt & pepper squid. It had a nice bite to it, nice and hot in places, and really well seasoned. I was afraid I'd swell up after that but no, didn't happen, so they are on point with that.

My daughter ordered Crispy Chicken, which tasted fresh but it definitely wasn't an adventurous choice. She liked it and they gave her plenty. She wound up bringing half of it back to the hotel and eating it the next day.

No, we didn't order dumplings. Next time.  Good, clean, quick choice for lunch."}
{"text":"Usually when you see a restaurant that has the word \"dumpling\", it's usually more traditional, which is what I was thinking.

I'm here in Montreal to meet up with some customer tomorrow morning.  Just came in few hours ago, checked in to hotel.  Very hungry as it's been a long day.  I had researched where Chinatown was, which is about 20min walk, so I was excited to see what they have here.  Walking up and down the main alley (forgot the name), there are about 4 blocks of Chinatown with shops, restaurants spilling over on both sides.  

Oh Dumplings had a great location as it was in a street corner, well lit, and the best part was that it was one of the few Chinese restaurants here that took credit cards.  Since I'm only here for 1 night, I didn't want to hassel with the money exchange.  Figured the word Dumplings, it has to be good.

I was traveling by myself.  I first wanted some boba tea, but they were all out of bobas?  OK, so I start out with the beef noodle soup, which is the basic traditional dish if it's a traditional restaurant.  Of course, I had to order an order of dumplings (15 total).  Got the beef version and had it pan fried for an extra $1.50.  

Food came about 10min later.  First off was the dumplings.  What I thought was the hot spicy oil was actually the Chinese bbq sauce.  Asked the waiter for some hot sauce and he brought back this red plastic catchup bottle where you squeeze the sauce out.  As expected, it was this light paste that didn't have much flavor or heat.  Quite disappointing given a good dumpling house or any good Chinese restaurant ought to have the traditional hot oil sauce.

Back to the dumplings.  I do have to say they were well made and quite tasty and juicy.  The bottom were well fried just enough and the top were well done (sometime, the top may not be well cooked at some other restaurants I've been in the past).  As you bite into it, it had plenty of flavor on its own and it was very juicy, but I just wanted some extra hot sauce to go with it.  Oh well.

Shortly after, waiter brought the beef noodle soup.  Now, I was born in Taiwan, and have since been back few times.  I've also eaten beef noodle soups all over Asia and US as I do my fair share of travel.  This is the first that I've seen where they added shredded cucumbers.  Now, there are certain noodle dishes that do taste better with it, but the hot beef noodle soup is not one of them.  Also, it had shredded salty turnips, which was also a first.  The beef was very tender, but it lacked the traditional taste which should be darker broth as this is very light.  The main ingredient should have 5 spices and aniseed, but this has none.  Then there is the noodle.  They have the yellow egg noodles, which again is the wrong type.  Don't get me wrong as the taste was OK, it's just not what I had expected on ordering a beef noodle soup from a restaurant that specialized in dumplings.  I would think they would have hand made the noodles or something.

Overall, it was a bit of disappointment as no boba tea, and so so beef noodle soup.  If you're there just for the dumplings, it's probably more like a 4 stars, but when you add up everything else, or what I had experienced, 3 stars is very generous.  

I will be back in a few months, but will likely try some other restaurants.  Perhaps next time, I'll just exchange some CAD so that I'll have some cash to eat at the real hole in the wall for something more authentic."}
{"text":"Dumplings, seem to be a new fad amongst the Montreal Asian Cuisine scene. Oh Dumplings, located in the heart of china town, is a new comer to the scene. Large interior, well lit, and open. It has a certain more touristy feel than the other dumpling offerings in the area. 

The menu is wider than the competition, offering typical western, and less western Chinese faire and powered bubble tea along with it's dumpling selections. The dumplings, filling is generous, the liquid has good flavour, but the skin is abit doughy and thicker than I prefer.  For the price point it's competitive, unfortunately, if I'm already in the neighborhood and wanting dumplings, I'd rather just go to Mai Xiang Yuan or Quin Ha. 

Oh Dumplings! has great potential, but needs to focus."}
{"text":"I was shocked to see mai Xiang Yuan was closed for renovations when I was going for my dumpling fix. So we noticed this place Oh Dumplings which was new and clean looking but just a couple of people inside.
I ordered 2 dumplings, one friend one boiled, potato strips and sechuan(La giji) spicy chicken. I specifically asked the lady if the chicken was done like in china. She told me yes it was. I even spoke to her in chinese so that she knows that I knew my chinese food. Guess not!!!!!
The chicken was not even close to the real thing. It was more like Kung Pao chicken. Which was not bad but not what I wanted!!!
One the other hand the potato strips were really good and the only dish that I really liked. 
Now the dumplings which was the reason I was there were not bad. But whats more important than anything for me is also the spice!!! I must say that this restaurant has the worst spice I ever had in a chinese restaurant!!!! It was horrible and totally killed the dumplings which were not bad. It had a bad smell and was a killer to the dumplings. Mai Xiang Yuan on the other hand has the best chilly spice outside of china. I offered to buy some from him buy he refused.
So i was not sure if I should give a 2 or 3 star for tonight??? 
Service was OK
Food OK
Spice horrible
Would I go back?? As long as mai Xiang Yuan is there, I think not!!!

SORRY!!!"}
{"text":"Dumplings were good and that is the most important reason. Atmosphere and overall presentation is something left to be desired."}
{"text":"Brief review: We came as a group of 4 over lunch.  Place was not busy but service was bit slow.  Water was served about 10-15mins after being seated.  We ordered five dishes and here is what I would recommend and avoid.  

Recommend: 
\"Pork, vegetable and shrimp dumplings - 10.99 for 15 pieces\". We ordered it fried for $1.50 extra.  Served with a light golden crust on the bottom, the dumpling is packed with juice and flavours.  

\"Spinach, mushroom, cabbages - 9.99 for 15 pieces\". Is a good alternative if you don't want meat dumplings.  Served in a green exterior shell, the dumplings have a nice aesthetic look.  The filling contains a nice blend of vegetables but is slightly under seasoned.  Just add some table side soy sauce/vinegar and it's perfect.   

Do not recommend: 
Avoid \"pork meat rolled in dried bean curd\".  Overly salty and average in taste and best.  Also, small portion not worth the 8.99."}
{"text":"Dumplings tres gouteux, bcp de tables, cuisine à la vue , cela inspire confiance, bon service."}
