{"text":"Awesome burger; perfect tacos and also the grilled sandwiches are pretty good! In addition to that they have the best fries!!! Prices are very reasonable!!"}
{"text":"Great food and some really good beer specials are the highlight for me. Mystery beer night is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Went to lebowskis for Dyngus Day for some polish beer ,cabbage ,polish sausage and pierogies . Okay so this is what I got a piece of toast, tasteless cabbage , bratwurst and some factory processed pierogies. Awful it is very sad to say that the owner is a buffalo native related to this dish.On another note  The service was good"}
{"text":"One of the 'Best Wings' in town and with that I choose to have their Friday special (crab cake, fried fillet, french fries and cole slaw), it was delicious. I was late for their Red velvet this time hopefully they will save some for me next. Dont think twice to try this place, just get in.  I missed the panthers flag dho"}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of the best food joints in all of Charlotte. I am pretty sure at one point I was eating at least 2-3 meals here a week, granted I was also within walking distance. Obviously if you've ever stepped foot in here then you know its a Buffalo, NY establishment. I have known a couple people from up there who have had no problems driving from places like Kannapolis and Matthews just to dine here.  I highly recommend the Wings (I prefer the gold rush), the Memphis Panini, or the Jerk Burger. To be honest though the best deal is probably the chicken tenders because you get a side as well getting them tossed in wing sauce, which makes them amazing.    If its a gorgeous night out I highly recommend sitting on their patio, although its relatively small it's a good atmosphere. Plus you can bring your four-legged friend if you want. The wait staff is extremely friendly and has become part of the reason I return week after week.   Even though this place is small they have a good size beer selection. But whats even better is that they have chosen the perfect beers to both compliment their food and their clientele. However what they are really known for are their white russians, which by the way are only $4 for the house version. They also have a small bar inside in case you want to just grab a drink, chat with the bartender, and/or catch a sporting event."}
{"text":"Having read reviews, we decide to try this place.  The chicken wings,  beef on weck, macaroni cheese were all good.  Husband had even the genesee beer.  Have lived in Buffalo, they even had Salemn hotdog during the weekend.    Staff was friendly, yes we will be going back again ! Parking would be a pain."}
{"text":"I have been to Lebowski's a few times now and it has quickly become my favorite place for some great well priced food and a great spot for an after work drink.   The jerkyaki wings are by far the best wings in Charlotte. The Beef on Weck is also another great item and again blows away the other competition that carry that same item.  If you are a white russian fan, this is a great place as well. I highly recommend the Bunny Toes, basically a white russian that tastes like melted mint chocolate chip ice cream! It's amazing.  There seems to always be beer specials as well!    The restaurant has a great laid back feel with about 20 or so tables inside, a nice bar, and then a great patio outside with about another 8-10 tables.  The service is always great as well. Very nice wait staff, food comes out quick, and the owner(s) on multiple occassions have checked to see how everything is and to just thank me for my business.   I will recommend Lebowski's to anyone looking for a great place to eat or just have a drink at a cool neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"Best hamburgers I've had so far in Charlotte.  The fried pickles were great too.  Staff was really friendly even though they had some hostile hot customers!"}
{"text":"Got a taste of Triple C Brewing \"The Dude Imbibes\" tonight at Lebowski's. I love that I can come to Lebowski's and get access to special local brews!  Lebowski's also offers sweet potato tots with a creamy, sweet dipping sauce...mmmm!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both had two items on the menu that claimed to be awarded \"best of Charlotte\" and although they were not bad, I wouldn't quite say that they're the best in the city. He had the beef on weck and I had the jerk style burger. They were just average.   Other than the food, I like the concept. We went on trivia night and although we left before it started, it got packed. It seemed like a fun neighborhood hangout."}
{"text":"The best wings I've ever had bar none. Also good fried pickles and garlic fries. This place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Even with no attachment to the Buffalo area or the Bills, we are constantly drawn to this place and it's infectious atmosphere. Easily the best wings around and the rest of the menu is great also. Nice beer list and good service. The only downside is the place is a bit small and you may have to wait a bit.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I had the \"shipweck\" with the haddock, roast beef slider, and garlic fries and it was impressively delicious. The garlic fries were some of the best I'd ever had and perfectly complimented the fish.  King of Pops had a stand outside selling gourmet popsicles that were a delicious dessert."}
{"text":"Lebowski's is so yummy.  The atmosphere is cozy and charming. Great food and spirits too. The parking lot is a tight squeeze but you cannot have it all.   Extremely great location. Close to uptown without the fuss."}
{"text":"Finally found a place with \"haddock\" fish & chips on the menu. Best haddock I've had in Charlotte so far. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Recommend the wings and the haddock fish fry.  A fun setting with references to The Big Lebowski movie, and good service."}
{"text":"Lebowski's has excellent food, great service, good drink specials, and best of all, it's not noisy. You can have a conversation with others at your table without having to shout.  Something to note, though, is that their parking lot is a bit awkward--it only has one entrance, which is also the exit. I generally find that if the lot is full, it means that there aren't any open tables."}
{"text":"Great Wings. Stinger sauce is the real deal. Can't beat the Wednesday Lunch Wing Special. \"Big Boss\" Grilled Turkey Club is great as well. Fish Sandwich (Haddock) Friday is another Great One! Great service!"}
{"text":"Cool place, tasty food and obviously delicious white Russians! Prices were good. Place isn't big but it didn't feel crowded. Friendly folks there. My cousin said their wings are the best!"}
{"text":"Had the Fried Pickles and Amy's Wrap, very good. The server was very nice and it was a fun place. The patio was perfect for a great November afternoon."}
{"text":"Love this place! The turkey burger with pimento cheese is the best, the patio is cozy, and it's a nice walk from Freedom Park. Also can't beat their martini deals!"}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Have been there a few times, and every time the food has been great!   Highlights: Beef on Weck, Mac 'n Cheese, Burgers, Jerkyaki Wings, Sliders.    Fun little bar as well, and cool theme drink menu -- check it out!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly service. Nice atmosphere. Really awesome fried pickles!! Seriously, try the fried pickles.   I like the chicken strips tossed in buffalo sauce, the fries are good.   Lots of weekly specials. Overall great place."}
{"text":"Outstanding, another Charlotte hide away. I was in town for a quick visit and had been here once before. Great service great people.  Had the jive burger I think that's the name, comes with diced pineapple and tomatoes, and pepper jack cheese. Cooked perfectly. I also had a side of wings, due to the fact that Wednesday is half price wing night, so why not. Had them tossed in the honey mustard sauce. Although for me a bit too much sauce, they had a great flavor, the chicken wasn't over cooked like it can be with wings.  They have tons of beer on tap, along with a good wine selection. I would recommend this place over some of the top rated Charlotte eateries any time. Great place to dress down and enjoy the evening."}
{"text":"Best wings in Charlotte. I recently moved to this neighborhood from another part of Charlotte. After 15 years of being in Charlotte I have finally found a place that knows how to cook wings the right way. They are always on point. Oh and the garlic fries yea they are to die for. Love this place. And the best part is that they are a dog friendly business. Pups are welcome on the patio and the staff is great to them as well. Thanks for Being so awesome!"}
{"text":"Best wings in town, great service, friendly staff.  All around great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches and excellent garlic fries. Super bartender and fun, cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"We walk here all the time and our kids love the food and atmosphere.  All of the staff are very friendly.  They have a good selection on the menu and great beer choices.  They have consistently good service and food.  Also what's great is that it is very casual and we can come in sports attire or choose to dress up as well.  We appreciate having a great place to eat in the neighborhood that won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"As a former Buffalonian the atmosphere and food at this restaurant brought on some tears of joy (not even kidding...so happy to see Bills and Sabres flags and even my college pennant).  Cant decide between wings or beef on weck?  They have a combo of 6 wings and a slider of your choice...Perfect! Both were delightful.  Garlic fries are also delicious. If they put provolone on their chicken finger sub I would say it was better than some I had in Buffalo.  Can not wait to go back.  Forgot to mention the prices...very reasonable."}
{"text":"Good beer selection and bar food.  It has a cozy, local pub feel to it.  Started with fried pickles.  Never tried in my life until starting to travel to Charlotte.  Now, can't stay away from them.  Especially on a Monday night with football on the TV.  Chicken Florentine Panini was also a call that I don't regret.  Magic Hat #9 from beer list was light & had an unexpected smoothness to it that was very nice.  More refreshing than your typical pale ale."}
{"text":"We love this place. It is family owned and run! They servers and bartenders are always friendly and up for a chat. They have an AMAZING vegetarian menu. You can get any of their burgers veggie style, ANY of them! The beer selection is good and their trivia night is always busy."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere with outdoor area. My brother in law loves the movie so all the memorabilia was a trip. Wings are great, very traditional buffalo style. Good selection of local brew. Very well done sports bar."}
{"text":"Very decent place. Went there on a Friday night, the medium wings are pretty hot, the fries are very tasty, and they really have great service. Very friendly and laid back. I had the combination plate which included wings, fries, and a slider for only 11.95."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for a wedding and took a chance on this place.  Although I am a Big Lebowski fan, the wing reviews are what made me check out this joint.  And, the reviews were right - I had the Buffalo-style wings and  were fantastic!  They have a great beer selection, both on draft and in bottle, and good beer specials, as well. What's more I had the pleasure of meeting both owners while I was there: Kirk, who is originally from Buffalo, and his daughter, Amy.  They are both good people."}
{"text":"This has become our regular family grub pub. Small, movie- themed neighborhood bar and grill down the street from our apartment with something for everyone on the menu. Lots of TVs, and has covered outdoor seating for people watching and enjoying the upcoming fall weather. Our waitress was so friendly it was actually making me paranoid. She legit seemed concerned if we were happy or needed anything, which is a change from South Florida. Refills were spot on. Get the wings and the chili....dude!  This is also a great family friendly place, our 2 year old was given a small bucket of good quality crayons and a coloring kids menu that wasn't exclusively crap fried kid food.   Only downfall, parking is minimal, but not worth a penalty to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came from out of town and found this quiet little spot. It was comfortable and the food was great. I had the fried pickles and a buffalo chicken wrap. I went on a Sunday night and there wasn't many customers but that was ok. Next time I come back to Charlotte I will have to stop again and hopefully it's a Friday or Saturday night"}
{"text":"I try to go here every Thursday night because of the free local music and the $3  beer menu.  After living in Charlotte for a few months I am a little sick of paying $6+ for every beer, so I appreciate a place with a solid beer menu with a chill vibe.  Food is pretty good, recommend the pork, beef on wheck and the hamburgers. The wings were pretty awesome until they caved to customer pressure to cook them faster.    Overall great place to chill with some friends if you want a pretty solid beer list with some good music and food."}
{"text":"Beef on Weck was OUTSTANDING! They must have the buns made especially for them as I've never seen one like it. The top has coarse salt and caraway seeds. The roast beef is shaved and has a savory tan color. Its tender and properly proportioned to the bun. A tray of spicy mustard, horsradish and horsey sauce comes to the table so each bite gets its own special dressing. French fries were crispy, hot and slightly battered. Loved it all and the place filled up quite well at lunch."}
{"text":"Ate at Lebowski's last night for the 2nd time ever. A small dining room with a small attached outdoor patio for outdoor dining. I enjoy how small the restaurant is, makes it feel like a local hang out and very chill.   Decor was a mix of the Big Lebowski and New Belgium brewery paraphernalia.  Drink special was $1 off draft, they had about 6 beers on draft. But they also offer 50+ craft & microbrews.  We started with the Niagra Street Nachos. These were pretty tasty!  I ordered \"The Boss\" Grilled Turkey Club for dinner with their delicious garlic fries!! The pimento cheese in this panini really makes it! My husband ordered the wings which he loved as well.  Overall a good experience at Lebowski's and we will back again to sample more fare."}
{"text":"$3 mystery beers, now that's true local love!  Just pulled a Ruby out of Hickory.  The yocals seem to be repeat customers, I dig the small joint feeling.  I paid my tab, which means I would like to return!"}
{"text":"I like it here...the salads are good & fresh.  The wings not bad and a very good Haddock!  This is a normal go to when I can't decide what I want, but want options.  The wait staff is pretty cool too."}
{"text":"Still four stars. Earlier, I said there was a (semi) good football team here in Charlotte. I would like to amend that statement & issue an apology for misinformation."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Lebowski's for years and it just keeps getting better. Love the staff, love the beer, and the food is always consistent and delicious. This time I asked for extra shredded lettuce on my turkey burger (Anchor Style - wing sauce and blue cheese crumbles) and they delivered! See the attached photo. Can't say enough good things about the place. I'll be back again and again and again. :^}"}
{"text":"I eat here a few times a week. The staff is very friendly and the service is great. All of their dishes are amazing. If its your first time eating here go with their jerk Burger and garlic fries!"}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte on business. Came to Lebowskis due to the great Yelp reviews. Was not disappointed. The Fredonia dip was great (must get it 'Wack-ed!). Lizzie was  excellent behind the bar and her Cinnamon Toast Crunch (TM) shot brought me back to my childhood!"}
{"text":"I go in for the Bills games. Great food, great drink specials. I would recommend the Wings, tenders, beef on weck or tilapia fish filet. Great White Russians if you are into those."}
{"text":"Yeah, well, you know, here's just, like, my opinion, man.  Lebowski's is the type of place that really know how to tie a beef on weck together.  From the garlic fries to the jerk burger, this place nails their food.    This is a great place to kick back and watch a game and put down a couple White Russians or beers.  Decorated with a hommage to Buffalo sports teams and The Big Lebowski, it's tough not to love this place.    The service is quick and friendly without helicoptering.  I'll be back!  Try:  The garlic fries as your side"}
{"text":"Pretty good food with great drink specials.  It's a cozy restaurant/bar that's open until 2 am. Definitely a place to check out, especially when all the other neighborhood restaurants have a table wait list."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pub.  Food is better than expected from a cozy family sports pub.  Daily food and happy hour specials make it very affordable.  Reliable staff service and food.  The beef on a wreck (salted bun) is a real stand out.  Wings are great."}
{"text":"Solid neighborhood bar and grill.  Nice mini patio and typical neighborhood bar inside.  Really good and pleasant wait and bar staff.  Good beer selection with about 10 regional craft beers on tap and another 20 bottles available.  As others have indicated they have good burgers and wings.  I like some of their low fat choices as well: veggie burger, turkey burger, and panini(s). The chicken florentine panini is as good as any sandwich that I have had in Charlotte. The current menu does not list the panini(s) clearly, but they usually can turn their veggie and turkey sandwich s (as well as some others) into an panini, which is excellent.  Parking is tight, but the next door retail locations close at 6:00 pm, and it is seems fine to park there after 6:30 pm."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant and bar!  The food is good and the service incredibly friendly. Nice selection of interesting and local beers. The fish and chips are the best in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Cantina, located across the street, many times and often thought about giving Lebowski's a try. About a week ago, my boyfriend and I decided to abandon Cantina and give Lebowski's a go.   We ended up getting there a little after 10 o'clock and had NO idea that they stopped serving their whole menu about 5 minutes before we got there! We had to select from their late night fare which includes fairly basic bar food.   I selected the Tuscan style burger with bruschetta, pesto aioli, and parmesan cheese with a side of garlic fries. The burger turned out to be really great and the fries were a great compliment. I usually prefer all the accoutrements with my burger but this one was really great on its own. My boyfriend got the Lebowski burger and loved it!  In addition to the surprisingly great food, the service and atmosphere was great. They had some really good drink specials that day and are famous for their White Russians which I look forward to trying on my next visit!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat and drink while in Charlotte.     Always good food and great service. Wings are better than most elsewhere. Fish and chips is also excellent.    Great beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Ever go to a restaurant and get met by someone with a sour face and a surly attitude? That won't happen at Lebowski's. If there's one thing I notice every time, and as my husband will tell you, COMMENT on every time, it's how friendly everyone at Lebowski's is.   We first tried Lebowski's after my husband heard about the authenticity of their Buffalo wings. The owner is from Buffalo, I believe, and it IS the Buffalo Bills bar in Charlotte. I went a few hours out of a trip up north just to have wings at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, so my husband knew I'd be on board with trying a joint known for its authentic wings.  We visit Lebowski's most often on Sunday around midday. Football games are on the television, and the routine is pretty much the same for me. My husband mixes up his orders, and his beers, depending on what they have on tap. I'm a horrible beer drinker (Bud Light, I consider it my karmic punishment for drinking so much beer) and a sucker for fish and chips, so that's what I get every time. Oh, in addition to an order of Buffalo wings.  The first time the server asked me if I wanted the \"junior\" size fish and chips, I asked her what she thought, since I'd never seen the serving size before. Fortunately she told me it would be fine. I have to wonder what the \"full\" size fish and chips is like, because the \"junior\" size takes up a massive plate!  The food is delicious. The environment is a million kinds of awesome, with the \"Dude\" theme going in full force. And as I said, the people who seat you, take your orders and bring your food are so nice I might invite them to Thanksgiving dinner next year.  \"Neighborhood grill\" describes Lebowski's perfectly. We live several neighborhoods south of Lebowski's, but are willing to make the drive every time we come here. Some Sundays I just wake up and mutter, \"Lebowski's?\" to my husband when I first see him. It's just that good."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bar. Everything I have had food wise has been excellent. I really like the Fredonia sandwich and my wife likes the Haddock fish platter and sandwich. Also love the wings and garlic fries. It is not a huge place, which I like, and just a cool place to hang out."}
{"text":"I chose this \"Small\" restaurant while driving through the area.  Although on  Sundays most of the restaurants in the Queen city seem to remain close.   This Bar/Restaurant does not disappoint.  Even though this is a Bill's bar and I am not a Bill's fan we were welcomed with open arms and even offered food recommendations by the locals.  The wings are true to life Buffalo Wings.  I have all applause and no complaints.  The flavor was amazing.  The texture was amazing.  The time to table was amazing.  The wings were to the table in 3 mins.    We ordered the fried Haddock for our main which arrived moments after I grabbed the last wing.  It was among the best pieces of fried fish I have ever had to include 4 and 5 star restaurants.   I did the garlic fries as a side.  Again some of the best flavors you can get from deep fried potatoes.    I was able to sample the Cole Slaw and the roast beef sliders.  I was not impressed with the flavor of either as for me I have had better.  For me the wings, fish, and service make this place super amazing.  P.S.  if your driving through get some wings to go.  I did not and I wish I did."}
{"text":"Great wings! The food here is wonderful. My favorite side is the spot tops with dip (sweet potato tots) they are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch a few weeks ago with a friend.  Have always heard great things and I was not in any way disappointed.  I had wings to open - two different kinds including traditional buffalo wings plus a pepper style wing that was a little sweeter.  Both were excellent - well cooked and just the right seasoning.  I particularly loved the buffalo wings.  I moved on to a beef on 'weck au jus with horse radish sauce and it was flipping fantastic.  Service was good, atmosphere was fun - loved everything about it.  Great job, great place!"}
{"text":"Came in from out of town and found this place. Great food and service. We got the wings and the burger both were fabulous."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on Saturday with my parents as they were visitng from out of town. My dad wanted a nice chill bar atmosphere with good food. Never been here before but thought of Lebowski's. That description describes them pefectly.   The inside is decorated very laid back with lights stringing across the ceiling. They had about 10 beers on tap, mostly local. I ordered one of Sycamore's IPAs.  My husband and I decided to split the Jerk Veggie Burger with garlic fries and 6 wings (Stingers sauce). I couldnt even tell that the veggie burg wasn't meat!! (great sign for veggie and black bean burg lovers like myself). The pineapple and jerk sauce on the burger were a perfect combo. Came with tons of fries! I only had one bite of the wings, but based on how fast my husband ate them, they had to have been amazing. I thought the bite I had was well sauced. My parents split the french dip sandwich and some chicken fingers.   Great night. My parents loved the food and we were excited to have checked out this great neighborhood-like bar!"}
{"text":"My husband loves this place because he is from buffalo and they have all the Buffalo food favorites. Walking distance to our house so our dog loves to sit on the patio and they bring her a bowl of water. BBQ Mac and wrap is so delicious!! Great little neighborhood hang out!"}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food (I recommend any of their burgers and their chicken fingers are awesome), big selection of beer. Only thing that I wish could be changed is the lack of parking. It's super hard to find a space here on busy nights. Guess that's a good thing, though...they're busy!! Super chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Don't let the 3 stars fool you. This place is actually pretty good just not 4 star worthy just yet.The place is very small and if you like a more intimate bar this is the place for you. They play some alternative music, which I have never heard in a bar before. The service is slow, even with there not being many people at the bar/ restaurant. I honestly expected there to be a whole lot more people there on a Football Sunday. The cool thing about this place is that they support local breweries and that is always a plus for me. That in itself almost brought them up to 4 stars. The food portion in my book was kinda small. I had what everyone recommends the \"Beef Weck\" it was really good and the Au Jus sauce was excellent but again too small and to pay an additional .45 cents for a dipping sauce to me is just crazy. Also, I guess that this place in a Buffalo Bills hangout spot with all of the memorabilia and the Flutie Flakes? I will be going back again when I am in the mood for a nice low key night with not too much going on. The food was ok and the drinks were fine. I believe that this is a everyday kinda bar for the normal type of person. Just like the name entails \"relax... man\""}
{"text":"Deliciolus food and hilarious Lebowski references, I love this place,  The mirror in the men's bathroom is one of the greatest things ever.  The burgers are some of the best in the city becasue you can get them medium rare.  The wings are some of the best I've ever had and they are a nice size also.  Love this joint.  (very proud of myself for not using any quotes from Lebowski in my review)"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, big portions...NC pints only $4 on a Friday! Nothing fancy but they really do it right. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lebowski's is consistently delcious.. The half price wings on Wednesday in combination with the $2 Mystery beers makes it the highlight of the week. The garlic fries are addictive, My husband and I always need at least two baskets of them. The beef on weck, the tuscan turkey burger, the haddock and the sweet potato tots with the cinnamon honey butter is like dessert!"}
{"text":"Great wings killer drinks if you like the movie than this is rite 4 u cool drink names and great people will definitely b back"}
{"text":"Ate with a few co-workers and we all were pleased with our meals.  Wings were fantastic and the roast beef on \"weck\" was excellent.  Gotta get a sandwich on the house made \"weck\" bread.  It was on point.  Mac N Cheese was good, actually pretty light with most of the cheese at the bottom.  Seemed like a decent neighborhood spot with average draft beer selection.  Only real drawback was the wait, but they were busy."}
{"text":"The more I come to Lebowski's the more I love it!  I been here at least 6 times in the past few months, both for lunch and dinner. Especially since they've been having Living Social coupons like crazy... man I love a good deal.   My boyfriend and I can't get over how a little dive bar like this has such outstanding quality food! As much as I still love the veggie burger and garlic fries here, I've totally fallen in love with their SALADS! My favorites? The Spinach (Organic baby spinach, feta cheese, red onion and dried cranberries) and The Mission Bay (Garden greens, tomato, roasted corn & black bean salsa, sliced avocado). I order both of these with a vegan patty on top and the CREAMY CILANTRO LIME dressing... best dressing ever!   My boyfriend is not a vegetarian like me, but doesn't eat as much meat as the average omnivore, he usually orders a veggie burger instead of a hamburger. But he's totally fallen in love with the quality of the Certified Angus Beef Burger here at Lebowski's.   This past Friday we came here with a Living Social coupon, so we wanted to try out an appetizer and we were particularly jonesin' for nachos, but the Niagara Street Nachos are the only ones on the menu and are centered around grilled chicken.  But no worries, I simply asked our waitress if they could make a vegetarian nacho plate... and MAN OH MAN the chef brought on an epic order I couldn't believe. Tri-color tortilla chips with queso, shredded cheddar, grilled spinach, zucchini, peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms and a side of salsa. WHAT? This blew my mind."}
{"text":"Not sure how many times I have been here..too many to count.   Never once was the food off or the service bad.   Amazing bar food in a relaxed atmosphere that I highly recommend.  The meatloaf dish is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Food is great, reasonable priced about $9-12 for many of the dishes. Everything is made their in the restaurant and you can taste the difference. Had their wings and fries. tastes so good. My only discontentment was the waitress. She wasn't very friendly or prompt. Don't sit on the side closest to the entrance door. I think she serves that area often. Everything else was great."}
{"text":"Back to Lebowskis for beef on weck. Have to get the au jus to make it authentic. Great place. Good service. Good food."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, tasty food. This is a fun place to grab a bite to eat and watch a game or two. Decent drink specials - they do a Wednesday night beer roulette."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant only because it was very nearby to an event we were to attend this night.  Wow were we ever pleased!  Great food, service and environment.  Friendly people; we later learned that our server was actually one of the co-owners!  Try the sliders assortment, ya can't go wrong!  Since our initial visit we've actually been back twice and continue to enjoy this fine little gem on East Blvd in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I'm not from Buffalo, nor have I ever been near that part of the world but can attest this place has the best Beef on Weck sandwich and wings I've had anywhere.  Can't comment on anything else as I never have anything other than the sandwich and wings.  Great stuff.  Friendly staff.  Can get crowded at peak times as its a small restaurant."}
{"text":"Wednesday wing specials. Big ol wangs! I ordered the 10 count and put away only 6. My eyes are bigger than belly. Local brews too."}
{"text":"Great place if you want a small tray or something home cooked, I highly suggest any of these writers or the macaroni and cheese dishes you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Great wings, tacos, beer choices and service. Would definitely recommend this place if you are from out of town and want some small bites at happy hour time with good beer and people."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fish tacos and fish & chips in town!!! Small restaurant/bar but surely a place to try : ) they will run a living social deal here and there $10.00 for $20.00 worth of food.   Parking is plentiful for the restaurant but can be tight at times.  Definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Really good wings. Buffalo bar with Beef on Weck, haddock fish fry and great wings."}
{"text":"I've been curious to try Lebowski's after I heard raves about their garlic fries. Being Italian and a carboholic, I had to try them ASAP. I've passed by there before and seen a good number of people on the patio but when I went was surprised by how little the inside was. I could see this being a good bar too that's not too loud and where you don't have to keep shouting \"What??!\" to someone when trying to have a convo. The menu had a lot but nothing was really screaming out to me so  I got the Jerk style Gardenburger with garlic fries (I love how you can sub meatless or turkey in the burgers) and it was pretty tasty with attentive service. The garlic fries could've been more garlic-y as I like enough to keep the vamps away.  I hear they have an awesome happy hour from 4 to 6P each day so I would love to check that out as I love anything cheap. Edit anything cheap involving the sauce. I had a good experience but it's not one of those places where I would tell people they have to try. I would like to check it out again to see if will be more memorable."}
{"text":"Quick recap: awesome environment, good food, amazing White Russians of course, great service. This is a spot everyone should come here at least once. And when you do, get the garlic fries. Amazing.   Place was a little dark but it kind of fits the mood. Posters and pictures of The Dude are everywhere so if for some strange reason you're not a fan of his, you might want to avoid this place.   I got a burger with garlic fries. While the burger was good, the garlic fries hit the spot like none other. It's an extra dollar if I remember right but it's worth so much more.   Of course I had a White Russian with my meal and it was on point. Not much to complain about at this place."}
{"text":"Outstanding wings!!!!!!!! A taste of home (Buffalo) wings mad right.  Great WNY atmosphere and awesome service. Also a great selection of brews on tap!!! If you want to know what REAL buffalo wings are like without going there? LEBOWSKI\"S. is the place!!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool little neighborhood bar, good food, great and varied beer selection, and cool friendly peeps working the place.    We're not really regulars here, but friends of ours basically live in here, so we do come in a good bit.  The patio has some TVs so you can enjoy the weather if it's nice outside without missing the game.  They also have karaoke several nights a week too, so if that's your kind of thing, then try to time your visit accordingly.  Oh yeah, the food! I really only get the wings, but I can say that they should be the only thing on the menu.  They're awesome flavors and perfectly cooked, get them and forget the rest!"}
{"text":"Omg.. Did someone say French fries! Yum!!  Ordered some to go.. Thrilled.. hot and crunchy!!! The Ranch is fantastic also!!!    As for the.. sweet potato tots. I'd tread carefully here. If you like a slight crispy outside with sweet potato mush, this is for you. It comes with a sweet dip. I had zero affinity for it or the tots  If anything, stick with the fries!!"}
{"text":"Not a place you expect to find great food...but you do. Good selection of local beers as well."}
{"text":"I have been there many times and I can say it has a very nice \"neighborhood bar\" feel to the place. The beers are usually reasonably priced but the specialty drinks tend to run at a bit of a premium. The menu has a good variety to choose from and while it does amount to pretty much just your run of the mill bar food it is priced very well and makes eating there affordable. Good beer selection as well.  Don't expect a sprawling restaurant when you go there. It probably only comfortably seats around 60 on the inside and 20 on the patio. However, this adds to the neighborhood bar feel and along with the friendly staff the patrons themselves tend to be on the friendly side as well which is a nice change.  The service at Lebowski's is really top notch and the servers are very attentive. You can tell all of the staff enjoys working there and that in itself can really add to the quality of any restaurant.   I would recommend it to anyone looking for a laid back place to enjoy a affordable meal, play some trivia on tuesday nights or just want to sit back and enjoy a pint."}
{"text":"My boss takes our team out to lunch once a month and this month I suggested Lebowski's. The menu seemed to have a good variety of food for everyone to enjoy. Also, I was a tad selfish and wanted to come here because the reviews of the wings are A++.   The parking lot is small, so if you drive a large vehicle I would suggest going somewhere else for parking during high peak times. The building is small but the inside was very clean for a pub like restaurant!  First I ordered fried pickles. And oh my goodness were they tasty!! They came out super hot and I couldn't help but eat them up because they were so good! Definitely recommend them! A guy who isn't a big fan of pickles tried them and he liked them, with ranch though.   I ordered the 6 buffalo wings and garlic fries. If you get regular fries your doing it wrong. Other people got the gold rush sauce.. I tried one.. and I really wish I would've gotten that sauce! It is described as tangy-sweet but it wasn't super tangy. Oh how tasty it was!! Can't go wrong with classic buffalo though.   The other guys got the Lebowski burger and said it was amazing. I didn't try it but they said they would be back to get it again. Finally, a guy got the chocolate cake. Wow! I had two bites and it was very satisfying!!   I didn't catch our waiters name but he was bald and a really great waiter! Other waitress help with refilling our drinks. So ultimately all of the staff was nice, patient, and always ready to help!   All in all, I was thoroughly satisfied with my experience for lunch today! I can't wait to go back! Also all the other guys (8 of them) said the food was very delicious and even they would come back on their own!! And some of them live a good distance away! I recommend it for sure!!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place? This place is outstanding the staff is great the food is awesome and the atmosphere is just like being back home in Buffalo. The best is on Sundays when the bills are playing and if you wear some bills a tire you are automatically entered into the raffle that they have but get there early because the seats go quick."}
{"text":"Good food can take a restaurant a long way.  Not much to say about the atmosphere, but this place has great bar food.  The patio is a great place to people watch on East Blvd while drinking a cold beverage."}
{"text":"Nice place located in the heart of Dilworth and the East Blvd corridor. Stopped by for lunch recently and sat outside on the nice patio. Waitress was nice, but a little slow considering the amount of tables that day. Not a big deal because the weather was beautiful outside and I had PBR in hand.   Ordered the chicken wings and the roast beef sandwich. I was told the chicken wings would take a little long (20 minutes) so I appreciated the heads up. That said; I love me some wings and have ordered them at several locations around town, both chain and non-chain. They've never taken that long, so I was curious. Needless to say, wen they arrived they were typical wings so I wondered why the 20 minutes was necessary. However, they were good and I went with the special sauce, which I can't remember at this time, but the waitress recommended it and it was flavorful. The roast beef sandwich was pretty good. My only complaint was the extra salt on top of the bun. Added a little too much salt as the au jus hand more than enough.   This is the first restaurant that has a chance to make it in this spot as the former ones kept changing every year. I'll be back to try some other items soon."}
{"text":"I've been to Lebowski's only one time since I moved to Charlotte. It was GREAT.   We were looking around the ole internets for some good trivia in the area and we found Lebowski's consistently making people's lists towards the top of the ranks. We decided to give it a shot.  We called ahead to get a reservation on Tuesday night with no trouble at all. As soon as we got there, they cleared a table for our group and sat us no problem! The menu had a bunch of things that looked tasty, which is always nice because you can get something and still want to come back to try some other things! There were a few specials on drinks (beer under $3, $4 white Russians) and some on food, too.  I opted to go with the *award winning* wings and was not disappointed! They were great. Not too spicy, but sauced up enough and crunchy. I got a side of pasta salad and although I'm not a huge fan of olives, the pasta and peppers part was delicious.   On to the trivia! My friends and I from DC played a lot of trivia up there, and really wanted to find a good spot in Charlotte. We nailed it on our first try. I forgot the dude's name who does the questions and answers there, but he was fantastic. It went at a good pace, and didn't last way too long like I've seen some trivias before.   Bottom line, if you're looking for a good trivia outing and some good food to accompany, Lebowski's is your place!"}
{"text":"We ended up at this place unplanned and we were pleasantly surprised. Our waitress was super sweet and answered all of our questions. The burgers we got were actually really good! We would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a Friday night staple for us.  Absolutely love going here.  The wings are the best I have found in Charlotte!  And the Fredonia dip, wecked, has to be the best roast beef au jus sandwich I've ever had.  And the garlic fries!!!!!!!!!!!  We always try to get Jen as our waitress because she knows our usual order, but really, the entire team is terrific.  I'm almost afraid to brag on them because I just don't want it to get too busy."}
{"text":"I had read about this place having good wings and I was not let down.  I just moved down here and they have the best wings I have had yet.  Awesome staff and great atmosphere.  Will definitely be back.  Might have to go again this weekend."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable!  I was immediately greeted by the manager upon entering, the bartender was extremely nice and friendly!  That's rare nowadays!   I followed a reviewers suggestion and tried the wings and roast beef.   Wings were really good - roast beef was incredible!  Thank you for a pleasant dining experience, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! I really wanted a fish fry like I grew up with in Buffalo and this was better. I had a junior size plate with garlic french fries. The haddock was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. Loved the garlic fries. The wait staff was attentive and friendly. Will definitely order this again. Truly a taste of Buffalo."}
{"text":"Lebowskis over the past couple years has turned into our local watering hole. The staff is awesome and really pleasant to talk to. All of the staff really knows there food and drink menu's. They always have awesome food and beer specials no matter what night you go there and the menu is always changing and getting better. I recommend trying the trio dip. There homemade pimento cheese dip is on point. They also have a nice little patio outside. If the weather ever gets below 90 in the summer it is the perfect place to have a few drinks with friends. They also have trivia on Tuesdays that is a lot of fun to go with some friends."}
{"text":"One of the better local bar/food combo places you'll find in Charlotte.  Not pretensions, just a good spot.  If you go for trivia on Tuesdays, be sure to reserve a table."}
{"text":"Lebowski's is a very small neighborhood bar but the bar itself is actually pretty tiny. I have heard many people rave about their wings and I've tried them but I never understood what the big deal was really. I am sort of a wing snob so maybe that is why I was not impressed but I was hoping for something more \"wow\" like when I tried my wings at Lebowski's. Overall, their food is better than your average bar food and they have a large menu with interesting food items.   They have a pretty good beer selection and most are in the bottle. There is also a decent sized patio that sits right on East Blvd so there is plenty to watch while hanging out with your friends. The atmosphere is definitely casual and I'm pretty sure it's a good spot for the service industry crew to come after work later at night. The decor inside is a little quirky and eclectic. The staff is very friendly and the bartenders are pretty well known in the area so they're good people to introduce yourself to!   Lebowski's is a great place to go by yourself just to grab a bite or a beer and meet new friends or bring your own and play trivia or mingle around on the patio outside."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere here when I visited. I didn't have any issues finding parking, the wait wasn't too bad and the wings were pretty good. Not my favorite spot for wings, but they're definitely very good. I plan on visiting again and trying something else."}
{"text":"The Buffalo wings are the best I have ever had. My wife really liked them ad she is normally a mild eater.  Thay have just the right amount of fire to them.  I thought the parking was crazy but the food and beer was great."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bar and The Big Lebowski themed which makes it that much better.  Cheap beers and good specials and a decent sized menu with something for everyone. In my opinion, the Beef on Weck is a little too plain for me. I like having cheese and sauce on it so I recommend the Fredonia Dip if you're like-minded.  Hadn't tried the wings until my most recent trip, and oh my gosh were they delicious. Screw the French Dips, the wings were much better, in my opinion.  Sampled the stingers and jerkiyaki which were both incredible. The wings themselves were on the small size but the flavors of both easily compensated. Great price, great food, great environment. I love this place. Shomer Shabbos."}
{"text":"I have now been here 3 times (coincidentally only on Tuesday) before painting at Wine and Design about a block down the street.   We usually park over at Wine and Design and walk in order to not have to deal with the traffic on East Blvd. It is an easy walk and on sunny days the King of Pops stand is out and he can be an excellent after dinner treat.   I digress a little. We (I say we because it can be between 2 and 4 ladies) usually walk in around 5-5:15 and the place is consistently empty, beating the after work crowd. We are seated immediately and check out the drink menu.   On Tuesdays they have $5 Stoli vodka specials and assorted beer specials (this past time it was Fat Tire drafts for $3). However, true to form I always get the same thing Stoli orange and Sprite. **They do list $5 martinis on their website on Tuesdays - wrong - it is Thursday.**  I also have always gotten the Fredonia dip with the horsey sauce on the side because the taste of horseradish is very prevalent in the sauce. It basically a roast beef sandwich with au jus. But way more than \"basic\". The sandwich is grilled on a delicious bread on a panini maker and comes out fresh and hot. I've also partaken in their spot tots ( sweet potato tater tots) and their garlic fries. I prefer the garlic fries which they make fresh from the fryer every time we go.   The waitress is always very nice and very quick. The staff help each other out so everything you might need (extra sauce, silverware, napkins, etc.) is always at your fingertips. I don't really see us going anywhere else for dinner before painting, despite there being other options like Cantina 1511 and JJs Red Hots, this place is just that good."}
{"text":"Great place. After our meeting @ C3-Lab we thought we'd check out some apps and a beer. We picked this place out and we're glad we did. They have a $3 \"mystery\" beers special and you can either go \"complete mystery\" or you can go for a \"style mystery\" - like \"lager.\" I scored with a Great Lakes Porter and Char got a Blue Moon Wheat Beer. Then we ordered the 10 piece wings with a side of regular fries (next time - garlic fries). We had the \"Stinger\" sauce on the wings and they were just the right balance of sweet and spicy for us and the fries were fabulous! All of this for $19.25 plus tip! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Perfect little neighborhood place to grab a beer and some wings. The food is great and the staff is super friendly. I will totally be back."}
{"text":"Lebowski's is known as being a true \"Buffalo\"/New York style restaurant.  It's not the biggest restaurant -- maybe 8 bar seats and 15-20 tables max? I've only had to wait a handful of times, though, so it works out. They are swamped on Sundays during football season as Buffalo Bills fans swarm the place.  Their wings are delicious, (Jeriyak is my favorite, following by gold rush and stringer sauce) they get 5 stars from me. All of their sides are also on point, including their garlic fries & their sweet potato tots.   Aside from their wings, I've had the Jerk Style Burger, fish tacos & buffalo chicken wrap. All are pretty decent, nothing out of this world. I definitely would recommend the wings over anything."}
{"text":"This neighborhood was in desperate need of a burger joint with reasonable prices and friendly atmosphere.  Lebowski's fits the bill.  I haven't found a $6 burger this good anywhere else.  Although getting fries will bump your tab up $2, it's not pretentious but not too low-brow either, like some other places across the street.    They have drink specials to boot.  On Wednesday's it's the only $4 Jack & Coke in the neighborhood.  The dirty rice was cooked perfectly and well-seasoned.  Burgers are juicy and even their pulled pork gives serious barbecue joints around town a run for their money.  Avoid the apple pie dessert, it's definitely pre-packaged/frozen, but maybe some of the other desserts are better.  Shocking really, how many trixies were in here on a Saturday night but I think that will cure itself eventually.  It doesn't present itself as that kind of a bar and should attract the right kind of people in no time.  I think I just found my new favorite place to eat in Dilworth."}
{"text":"We wanted to like this place. Liked the ambience, the outside sitting area and thought that it was quaint. Our server was horrible and that probably did not help. She would disappear for long stretches of time. The wings that we had as an appetizer were really good and they might be worth giving the restaurant a second chance!  We both had sandwiches and they were not good at all. Thought that the menu was typical, and honestly if the menu is so small then the items on it should be outstanding. Other than the wings that we had, that was not the case.  If you're in the mood for wings I think give it a shot! If you're in the mood for anything else... Look else where."}
{"text":"I went here for their wing special. I was not disappointed. I feel like usually for a wing special you can get the one that haven't sold all week and have been in the freezer. These tasted fresh and were a great size. I only did the 10 wings and a side of fried pickles  (to share) and I left full. I enjoy their mystery beer option for $3. It was great, the bartender ask what kind of beer that I liked and chose one based on that. I've gone to places where the mystery beer is usually a cheaper non craft beer or one that doesn't sell. I will be back."}
{"text":"Wings...AMAZING! If you don't order anything else here, get the wings! They are Award-winning and I see why. Just the right amount of crisp and the sauces we tried were both great. We also ordered the Fredonia sandwich. I wasn't a fan. It wasn't great in my opinion, but My Love loved it."}
{"text":"My husband'a favorite place to eat. Great bar food, fast and friendly service, and easy on the wallet. They always have a great selection of draft beers and rotate the taps often."}
{"text":"This place has our favorite fish & chips.  They serve a very large fillet of fish that has a thin, crisp batter.  It is accompanied by homemade fries & slaw, however you can substitute sides.  Other sides are garlic fries, side salad, Mac & cheese, as well as more.  I had a side salad with their Greek dressing.  The Greek salad dressing Was the best! It has feta cheese in it.  My other side was the slaw.  It has a strong horseradish taste which I didn't care for, but my husband loved it.  He ordered the fish as well, with garlic fries that he thoroughly enjoyed.  We are in the covered patio."}
{"text":"Constructive criticism: This place use to be \"True Buffalo food\" however, the owners  seem to have sold out to the south. It's a shame! They need to go back to Buffalo, eat true Buffalo food for a week, then come back to Charlotte and retrain their staff and find new food venders! If you claim to be a Buffalo Restaurant, then be one! This is a bad imitation. Rolls where \"fake\"  weck rolls, the Roast Beef was nothing but watery meat, chicken fingers where nothing more than Target bought strips and the sauce was nothing like true Buffalo wing sauce, and let's not go there with the fries! The Labatts was the best part of my meal."}
{"text":"Well, I was taking my wife to Jack in the Box as she had never eaten at one and when we arrived it was no longer in business. The first thing I did was rip out my iPhone and hop on Yelp. This place popped up and the reviews seemed good. We headed around the corner and we were very glad we did.   I ordered the VeraCruz style Turkey Burger with the Mac & Cheese. I will admit that the Mac & Cheese was good but nothing to scream and shout about. It was better than most that I have gotten while eating out though. The Turkey Burger on the other hand is awesome!   My wife ordered the Lebowski burger which was a HUGE beef burger with roast beef on top with queso. She loved it. I had a bite and I would have preferred just the burger and queso, not the roast beef but I am not a huge fan of roast beef to begin with. On the side she got garlic fries. Again, Awesome!   We also tried the Bloody Mary. This was the best Bloody Mary I have had in a while. We also tried a couple of the many beers they have and some shot... I believe it was a whip it. Not sure but it was incredible.   Last but not least... Lizzie. AWESOME server!!! She was very friendly, knowledgeable of the menu and good conversation.   This place is great. If I lived in Charlotte this would be one of my regular hang outs."}
{"text":"Wow. Where to begin. I guess I should probably state for the record that I'm an avid Big Lebowski fan. Been out to the Lebowski-fest, had myself a bowling league based around it, and simply can't get enough of watching it.  The movie really is a cult classic. I feel that it is a fantastic restaurant \"theme\" that this business pulls off very well. If you are a fan, you need to come and check out this place. Its not just the name of the restaurant that attracts, but the décor as well. Very nicely decorated interior with all sorts of related memorabilia.   The food options are broad, pretty generic, but overall VERY good (for what I've tried, to date). You won't find any fancy movie quotes/ names on the menu other than the Lebowski's Burger, which by the way, is also pretty damn good. Beer selection is also broad. The outdoor seating is great in the summer.  Overall, an absolute great restaurant/ bar, and would definitely be the dude's local hangout joint."}
{"text":"Now I must start this off by saying that the main reason I am writing this review is because they play Dispatch, and for that they have my heart! The place is small and very cozy, has a really friendly atmosphere. It's mixed with families, couples, and friends hanging out drinking beer and catching a game. I really like this kind of place over the typical overcrowded loud bars/restaurants around town. The food was pretty good nothing to write home about, but in all fairness I've only had a sandwich so I'm going to have to try some more food before I can say more. This is the spot for a week night with the hubby, can't wait to try more food! Cheers!"}
{"text":"...As some of you may know, I took a short hiatus from writing reviews.  This break was due to some negative feedback I had received from restaurant owners, but mostly because I was busy with work...  ANYWAYS, after much prodding (thanks Ben!) I'm BACK, and I'm back to close out 2013 with a slew of the best reviews from around the QC. What brought me back, you ask?  Simply put, THE DUDE, and the wings they serve up at Lebowski's...  Two buddies of mine had been encouraging me to give Lebowski's a try.  I was told Wednesday was the place to go because of their half-priced wing special on Wednesdays.  As I had this past Wednesday off from work, I decided this would be my virgin foray to Lebowski's.    Parking:  There is plenty of parking located behind Lebowski's.  I am not sure of the relationship between JJ's and Lebowski's, but you could also probably park on the JJ's side of the building as well.  No parking issues at all, which is always a plus.  Ambiance:  The first thing I noticed upon entering Lebowski's is the darkness.  Though I went there around lunch time this past Wednesday, the place felt dark and somewhat dreary to be honest.  One would think that with such connections to the Big Lebowski, it would be a bit more lively inside.    Service:  We were greeted by the one person that was working the entire bar.  She told my friend and I, we could seat ourselves where ever we wanted.  Our drink and food orders were taken fairly promptly.  Though our server probably had three to four other tables, her service was still very much on point.  Our drinks were refilled promptly, when we asked for an extra ranch, one was brought directly to us.  Food:  As I stated above, I came here on Wednesday, looking to sample the wings I had heard so much about.  So of course, I ordered a batch of 10 goldrush wings which did not disappoint.  The wings had that rare combination of being well-cooked yet still tender.  The meat on the bones was very tender, and fell off the bone with with every bite.  The wings were PERFECTLY sauced.  There's nothing worse than a dry wing!  The ranch was thick and cold, just as it should be.  My friend ordered the buffalo-style wings and was also satisfied with wings.   I've only been to Lebowski's once and I've only had one thing on the menu.  Nevertheless, the wings, and service were excellent and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Spent the Holidays in the 716 (Buffalo, NY) last month and for some strange reason had a taste for wings. Mind you, we likely enjoyed this Western New York delicacy at least 5 times during late December but still a lite spicy snack was in order.   We ordered a couple of drinks and a double order of wings medium with a side of hot sauce. The server was prompt, pleasant and recognized us from earlier visits. It's nice to enter an eatery and be made to feel like old friends. Being a slow Monday evening, our wings were served in short order exactly as ordered.    Our wings were as meaty, spicy and flavorful as any wing I've ever consumed in WNY. And the friendly atmosphere makes Lebowski's a great place to meet friends, enjoy an adult beverage or two and sample some great wings. You'll find a rather diverse menu to choose from but don't miss the opportunity to try some of the best wings in town!"}
{"text":"We love, love, love this place!  It is a hometown, laid-back kind of bar that just happens to have awesome food, but not pub food.  The menu is small enough to have options but not so large that they cannot maintain quality.  I had the beef on weck and my husband had the sliders. Both options were great, but I won hands down with the beef on weck.  The roast beef did not have any chewy (gross) bites and the bread was ahhh-mazing!  The garlic fries were perfect as well.  Now to the best part...the service.  Jen was our assigned server, but everyone seemed to check in and take responsibility for the customers.  Jen was truly outstanding!  She was so personable and gave us great recommendations for other restaurants to try in the neighborhood.  When the food is good, the atmosphere is good, and the server is GREAT.....we will be back time and time again.  I would give this place more stars if I could and I will have to pace myself so that I do not burn out on it!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the movie, the Lebowski Burger and Gold rush wings. Great place to grab lunch or dinner or late night snack. It is a sports bar and it can get boisterous but I like that atmosphere every now and then. The lighting in the evening is dim, which can make a night out with the hubs seem romantic until I get Gold sauce all over my fingers, but not so dark that you struggle to read the menu. Seating is sometimes limited for large parties, but we never had a problem with 2 or 3.    We come here once or twice a month and  I oscillate between the Lebowski Burger (Angus burger topped with roast beef and queso on a weck roll) and the Gold wings. Definetly a Yankee thing to have to pay extra to swap chips for fries or any other side but not a deal breaker. The garlic fries are good but I usually try to order a salad when I get the Lebowski Burger.   'Dat burger. Mmmm. 'Dat burger. So thick and juicy! I think the caraway seeds and salt on the Weck roll is what sets it above all other burgers. Or it could be the queso sauce. I keep saying I will try the beef on weck or some other entree but I haven't had the willpower yet. It calls to my soul and I give in almost every time.   Wings. Yup. They know what they're doing. Gold Wings are a sweet, spicy tangy sauce and the wings are perfectly crisp. I could eat 20 by myself. Okay, maybe 30 if I was starving and had no haters dining with me, but I usually split 10 with the hubs for an app.   They have daily specials (I always want to come here for the Monday Date Night special - 2 burgers for $12 - but we never seem to make it over there).  We've been for the Wednesday Wing special before (1/2 price wings) but I probably will never do that again. I have a lack of self control around chicken wings."}
{"text":"Not sure why I had never reviewed this place yet.  I've been going here for years.  It seems to be the place Dilworth area bartenders go to eat after their bars close for the night.   Even though I had lived in Upstate NY for a year I actually heard about Beef on Weck from here, not Buffalo.  Now I make sure to get it when I go back up there, but I like Lebowski's Beef on Weck and Lebowski Burger.   The place caters to the northern transplant crowd and is packed when the buffalo football and hockey teams are playing.   There is a full menu of white russian type drinks.  The daily specials are usually a good deal too.  My biggest issue is the parking lot is almost always a cluster."}
{"text":"I have been to Lebowski's a few times now and I've always had a good experience. The wings are by far the best thing on the menu. They also have many different daily specials. They have a great trivia night on Tuesdays. The host is pretty funny and the trivia questions are enjoyable. They also make a very good White Russian."}
{"text":"nice bar with a solid beer list. watching the Michigan and Louisvile championship game right now. lot's of tv's. I just had the chicken taco's and highly recommend them, especially durring their early or late happy hour.  Seems to be a total dude hangout, but I am here on a tuesday night, so that might explain the high percentage of sausage.  Louisville ended up winning if you didn't know."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Lebowski's for almost 10 years. Great atmosphere for a sporting event or just hanging out with friends.   Nice beer selection. Pretty much the whole menu from sandwiches to salads are tasty.  The outdoor patio is nice for some fresh air."}
{"text":"Service was quick! Food was just ok.  I had tacos which can with a great amount of meat. The flavor was bland."}
{"text":"What a fun place to enjoy lunch. The burgers are awesome and the service was excellent. We sat outside so we could enjoy watching the game. The patio is pet friendly. Reasonably priced and they had great beer specials the day we were there. Would love to go back!"}
{"text":"Really good food with ample portions! I was a little turned off by the $9 price on the pimento cheese app but I saw what I got and then understood. I was born and raised in Buffalo so chicken wings are a stand alone food group for me and I'm very critical! Usually I buy dry wings and make my own sauce (Franks Redhot and melted butter is all it is people!!). Let's be honest, the wings are blue cheese are not dead on like you get in Buffalo but they were still very good! I got the Buffalo style which were advertised as being medium (that's how I like my wings anyway) but they were too spicy, also they didn't taste like the classic Franks/melted butter sauce...maybe bc it was too spicy for me to get into them too much. I also tried the Gold Rush which were a tad spicy but very good but still not like the BBQ wings you get in Buffalo! But maybe that's what they weren't going for which is ok. Lastly, the blue cheese tasted home made and I really loved it, it just wasn't like Rooties or any other classic blue cheese you might get at many spots in Buffalo. I'm giving this place 5 stars because the food was really good all at reasonable prices and being from Buffalo I love the concept. Again, not dead on like you get in Buffalo but pretty darn close and very good!!"}
{"text":"There were 4 of us and we all got different things. The beef on weck was excellent, the fish was amazing, the burger was very good, and the wings/slider combo: bones were broke and small. Mac and cheese was great but we needed more cheese- they did add it without question! Fries were awesome and fried pickles were super, but a bit too salty!"}
{"text":"I went here quite a few times. Love their sliders and their wings. Especially Wednesday Wings night. I'm also addicted to their meatloaf. 3 patties with gravy potatoes and veggies. I'm very picky about other people's meatloaf because I make some awesome meatloaf. I mean that's all I know how to cook beside steaks. I enjoyed most of their sliders. Their cheeseburger, haddock and coleslaw and of course the meatloaf and gravy sliders are some of my favorites!! As for the wings. I like the Gold Rush and the Jerkiyaki are my go to.  Customer service is alway great. Can be a little off when it's crazy pack. The parking sucks at times. You can't make reservations. But other than that, I will continue to come back for those sliders and wings!"}
{"text":"If you wanna feel like a local, visit Lebowski's.  Not to say that this is a true \"locals\" spot, because it's really not, but it just feels that way. Some nights it feels like you're on an episode of Cheers, where everybody knows your name, although it may be your first time stopping in. Even with their lit up sign prominently displayed close to East Blvd., Lebowski's can be extremely easy to miss. It's not a big place, but it's got big heart and character.  The wings...don't miss out on these wings. I have had the wings here at least 20 times and they never mess them up. Their sauces are phenomenal and every wing is cooked to perfection. With all of the Buffalo, NY decor and considering they used to make the pilgrimage up to Buffalo to participate in their annual wing competition, Lebowski's knows wings.   Other notable items: burgers, any of the sandwiches, fries, and of course the infamous chili-mac. I have never dabbled with their entrees except for the smothered chicken, but I'm sure they offer some good dishes in this area. The drinks are pretty standard. If it's artfully crafted cocktails you're after, think again, but if you want a good moscow mule you're in luck. Their draft beer selection is limited, but is always made up of at least 2 or 3 solid choices.  The service is typically solid and would meet most people's standards. It's a small venue, so it's hard for your table to be forgotten. Prices are fair; nothing too crazy here. If you are in the mood to go somewhere casual for a damn good sandwich, visit Lebowski's. For everything that it is, it's done extremely well without trying too hard...a solid 4.5/5."}
{"text":"I transplanted here from Western NYS right after Bills went 0-4 in Superbowl attempts.  Yes, it still hurts.  Lebowski's understands this and provides their form of healing with booze, wings, beef-on-a-weck, and fried haddock (no, not Cod.  They understand).  When I'm feeling I need a little hug from home,  I drop in and rekindle my spirit with their's.    Service has always been spot on, the food hot and homey, and the price easy on the cash flow.  Go Bill's.  Go Lebowski's.  And, go Panther's, of course!"}
{"text":"The Best Buffalo Wings In Charlotte Period."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, especially the Haddock!  A friend took me there and I've taken many others there!  Great service, wonderful atmosphere, everything anyone has ordered has been excellent!"}
{"text":"Some of the best wings in town. It's always nice to get a bit of home (New York) down south. Great service, and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food on a nice, intimate patio!  The staff was super nice when we brought our puppy to eat with us. They even have her a bowl of water. Excellent, tasty food was much appreciated here!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out on a sunday after a wicked hangover.  The bartender was amazing.  She was very open to talk and answered our 9 million questions.  I ordered a burger with roast beef on the top.  I asked for medium rare and got rare.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing because I wouldn't want it to be overcooked.  My friend's fish and chips was massive.  The garlic fries are definitely what you need as your side in any dish here.  The beer selection is pretty good, but without the niceness of the bartender I wouldn't like this place as much.  I wish I could give this place a solid 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting an over-the-top themed homage to The Great Lebowski, although there are some pictures of Jeff Bridges on the walls and references to movie characters in the menu. Came here with friends fora fun, casual evening. Definitely better than bar food, and a great bar to boot. Three of us had The Nutty Walter, smooth and just enough kick."}
{"text":"I had the veggie burger and it was one of the best I have had since living in Charlotte. The garlic fries are delicious! I wish I could remember our waitresses name but she was amazing! Super friendly, fast and amazing service! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It definitely exceeded my expectations! From the outside it looks like a basic bar, not appealing to me, but once we entered it was very open with plenty of seating and didn't have a \"bar\" feel.   There are tvs on each wall so we were able to watch the March Madness basketball games very comfortably. We even chuckled to see an old arcade game. It looks like they may have Wii games too...since there was a Wii system hooked up to one of the tvs.   They have limited vegetarian options; however, the veggies nachos and the veggie burger were pretty good. The french fries had an extra layer of batter and nice and crisp.   Good experience overall!"}
{"text":"Great easy going neighborhood sports bar. Good local beer selection."}
{"text":"The staff was so friendly and nice. Also got to speak to the owner, you can tell by his character why they are so successful. The Gold Rush wings were to die for...just amazing. We also had the Lebowski burger which was just yummy...designed for meat lovers. The caraway seed bun was like none we had ever had. Also recommend the Mac and cheese with pecan bacon. We will be back on our next visit."}
{"text":"Just moved to Charlotte full time this summer and had Lebowski's on my list of places to try. Went to dinner here Saturday with a small group of friends and was in heaven! I first walked in and felt I was home (Cleveland, OH) up North with their Buffalo sings and the smell of sweet comfort food. Atmosphere, 10! Waitress, 10! Now onto the food. So much to pick from and only so much room in my belly. I split the chicken nachos and one their burgers. First off the chicken nachos were just average, as the waitress warned me. But the burger was so so delish!! The buttered bun added that north Home taste. Wings are my next must try on my next visit!!! Great place for food and fun!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in Charlotte. They have great specials and food. The staff is always very friendly and the bar has a very inviting feel to it."}
{"text":"I'm back again, I know I have reviewed this place before and given a five star review but it just keeps getting better and better every time that I come. I just ordered the three sliders and got one buffalo, one beef on weck and one meatloaf slider. They were all three so delicious! My favorite was the beef on the weck but the other two were close contenders. The service is always above and beyond. Everyone is so nice. I absolutely love the decor and the vibe of this place. The music is great and the drinks are better. Wide variety of local beers! Can't wait to come back so soon!"}
{"text":"My food was great! Ordered The Boss, it's a turkey club, it was awesome and garlic fries!!! Love, love, love! The service was pretty slow, but she was friendly. I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Great place!!!   Found it by yelping fish on the way to Florida.  We liked it so much we made a point of staying in Charlotte on way  back to Ohio.  Had the haddock and garlic fries, delicious, even junior size is plenty.  Husband had french dip  and really enjoyed it!  Service was great, only negative is the parking lot! Will hit it up every winter on journey south:)."}
{"text":"Just an update.  The wings are pretty good, but there are better in Charlotte.  I wish they had \"hot, medium, or mild\" like in WNY, but there is just \"Buffalo style\" plus three or four other flavors.  They didn't take 20 minutes, so that was good.  My guess is that they may have been baking them previously; it doesn't take more than 9 minute to deep fry chicken wings.  The fried pickles were awesome, as was the Sunday \"breakfast/lunch\" sandwich on Nova's bread.  Prices are very good too."}
{"text":"\"The best wings south of West Seneca.\" I couldn't agree more. Being born and raised in West Seneca, NY just represents the irony, but the food is honestly delicious and reminds me of home. My friend and I went on a weeknight and were quickly seated to the outside patio. We enjoyed some beers, wings, and sandwiches. All was great and delicious!"}
{"text":"Charlotte has a derth of independent restaurants with decent food for a good price; Lebowski's is an exception.  Their daily specials are a deal.  The portions are plentiful, the beef on wek is delicious, and I haven't found a better fried fish plate in town.  Try the garlic fries...thin and crunchy.  As far as ambiance goes it is definitely sports oriented with lots of TVs; and if you don't want to get caught in the loudness of Trivia night avoid Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Here from out of state and looking for something new this was a great treat ! Went in for a easy dinner and left very pleased. Had the trio dip to start it was excellent. Good drink specials and service."}
{"text":"Wings wings wings! I have to admit, Lebowski's has some of the best wings in Charlotte in my opinion. They are flash fried, but juicy and tender. A must order when you come here!   Also, order the Buffalo chicken wrap and you will be golden! Nothing special here, but they make some pretty good bar food, but beware (or not) this is a Buffalo Bills bar so don't plan on coming here to watch any other football games during the season. These fans are crazy fun so if you want a good time come to Lebowskis for a game- get a drink- and enjoy the show!!! And the food :-)"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place.  Great for during the week happy hour -  or a stop on a date night -  or weekend meal with our kids.  Place is very kid friendly.  Beer is cold - great selection of locals.  Wings are legit - get the gold rush (you're welcome).  Also get the fish fry or fish sammy both are good.  Hamburgers are solid.   Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"The wings were just ok. I've had better. I wouldn't go here if I was in search of the best wings!"}
{"text":"Despite the continual infusion/intrusion of trendy new restaurants all around it, Lebowski's Grill & Pub just continues to do what it does best, which is to serve up decent burgers and chicken wings. There's absolutely no pretense, inside or out, about this neighborhood favorite. Most people will either love or hate it. Its cramped interior defiantly shows its age and parking can be pain, which is why this suburbanite decided to go for an early lunch.  I tried the 10 count wings, half Buffalo style and half Stingers, for $10.79. They were tender, meaty and tasty as advertised. I followed those with their popular Jerk style burger, which was topped with pineapple and peppers. It only included chips but otherwise it was made with top quality Angus beef and served on an egg bun. It was tasty, but at $9, I would expect a little better side than slightly stale chips. My friend had the Supreme Burger, and although also good, we both agreed that we were biased after enjoying one of Charlotte's best burgers another historic bar and grill the day before.  Sanitation score was acceptable at 94.5 and the service was attentive and friendly. Fountain drinks at $2.29 each were filled regularly. Overall, we found the meal to be slightly better-than-average, but I admire it for what it is, a simple neighborhood bar that reflects pride of ownership. Although it's not on my Gotta Try list, I'd definitely stop by again if I were in the area for a burger or a brew."}
{"text":"Been here several times and my wife even more and I can't believe I have not gotten around to writing a review till today.  It's a great place with a western NY twist on things. Server told us the owner was from Buffalo which explains all of the Buffalo Bills flags and Western NY School pennants.  We drove down right after Church. We were originally looking for another restaurant and we could not find it, decided to go with what we knew was good.  Walked in about 11:30 and basically had the place to ourselves but that changed quickly.  Our server was very attentive. My wife ordered Unsweet tea which I questioned how sweet the sweet tea was. She brought me a sample and it was too sweet so she ended up mixing it half and half.and she did that throughout the lunch.  My wife order the Smothered Chicken which she has ordered before and she liked it.  I had the Fredonia.  Starts out as a French Dip but time you put it on a Weck Rolls with Caraway Seeds and horseradish it's closer to a kimmelweck which make since considering the Buffalo Connection.  Excellent choice since that is one of my favorites.  I actually glad we could not find that restaurant because lunch today was great and I finally got a changed to write a review of it."}
{"text":"This was a good spot. I came in right after they had trivia night. It was late. Hopefully I can go early next time and actually have some fun with that, but let me get to the point... The food was pretty damn good. Now granted I didn't step outside the box. All I got was some wings and burger & fries. But you'll be amazed at how hard it is for some spots to get that right. I like my burgers medium well and that's the way I got it. Fries were seasoned so if you got HBP you might wanna tell them to ease back on that. But they were good too. prices were affordable. And the service was good. Overall cool spot. I'll be going again."}
{"text":"We were missing home (western New York natives) and didn't realize how much we missed wings!  Excellent service and food! Can't wait to go back for fish fry and Bills games!"}
{"text":"Ate here again last night - best wings in charlotte for sure.  Also had the garlic fries which were super!  It was crowded, but we were able to eat at the bar without a wait - bartender was super friendly."}
{"text":"First time here was tonight and it was great! Very friendly and helpful staff and very fun environment! It's always nice to have a great night out spot that's not crazy expensive and has a good variety. I'm vegetarian so it's also nice to know that there are options here as well. FYI the buffalo cauliflower is wonderful! And the tacos are huge! Lol much better than I was prepared for!"}
{"text":"Try the \"Havana\" the best sandwich in Charlotte! Having a pickle allergy, I asked to remove the pickles. Their service was on point, and I was 100% satisfied! Amy, one of the ladies who took care of me, was welcoming and friendly!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings in Charlotte. Ask for the them extra crispy btw. I have been here twice now and both times I felt more at \"home\" than any other bar I have visited. The people working here and visiting could not be more friendly. I have visited at least 75 different places in the last year and this place has the best neighborhood feeling by a mile. I love good wings and no other place satisfied me like this place. I met the owner today and he bought me and the guy next to me a beer. Can't wait to go back and try the beef on weck (these guys are true New Yorker's and know how to cook. If you happen to be a Buffalo Bills fan (I'm sorry) this place is for you. I highly recommend giving this place a chance."}
{"text":"Once i heard there was a restaurant called Lebowski's, the next day my special lady friend and i made the trip. It's hard to give an objective review for two reasons. First, i've always loved \"The Big Lebowski\" and love a good (or even a cheaply made ones at home) White Russian. Second, just before we got our food, a parade of douschery took over the patio area.  You know the kind of people that are just annoying unless it is you and your friends, then they actually seem funny and fun.  The patio area is nice with a good amount of seating and cornhole and some bowling pin game i didn't get to check out. It seems like the cornhole cramped the area a little bit once the patio got the big crowd and maybe should be put up until after dinnertime.   The Lebowski Caucasian was pretty good, but i can't say i would pay $9 again for it. i believe i saw $2 Coronas for the months of April and May.   i can't say the food was outstanding, the wings were good, but not the best. The Buffalo beef on weck was better than the wings and would definitely be my recommendation. I had never had it before, It is really just a \"roast beef sandwich on a salty kummelweck roll.\" i do love pretzel salt and bbq so i would probably get that again with some beer.   We liked our server although we could have used him mid-meal for some additional bbq sauce."}
{"text":"Decent burgers and fries. We had a to go order so maybe not as good due to that but everything was average. The atmosphere looked good inside but obviously didn't stay.   Updated this to reflect 4, after a second visit. We decided to try it again because we were craving wings and they were said to have great wings and they were right. The wings were fantastic. We got the buffalo and gold rush and they were huge. If this was my first experience I would have said 5 stars but because if the take out order we had I split the difference."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Atmosphere and wait staff are top notch.  The best part is, they are open late and the nighttime menu is excellent.  Try the spinach artichoke dip, and of course the garlic fries!"}
{"text":"Lebowski's is a great neighborhood bar/grill with food that stands far above what these places normally serve.  The standout: Beef on Weck.  This Buffalo-based sandwich has yet to go national on a large scale, but, if this is a typical version, a French dip will never be the same.  Basically this is a warm roast beef sandwich whose highlight is the roll:  a salted kaiser roll with caraway seeds.  Possible toppings include traditional dip sauce, pure horseradish, creamy horseradish, mustard sauce etc.  They have many other interesting sandwiches but our short trip to Charlotte meant we couldn't sample them all.  However, we were able to order \"slider\" versions of their sandwiches which is basically 2 or 3 mini versions of their popular sandwiches.  All were excellent but the beef on weck make this a destination."}
{"text":"I love the food here, I am a huge fan.  Their wings are usually my go to choice of food here they are among my favorite wings in Charlotte. I got some sweet potato tots with them that had a delicious dipping  sauce. I have also had some of the sliders as well as a couple roast beef sandwiches all delicious.  If in the mood to sit outside they also have a great patio on which I sat the last time I came here on Wednesday which you get 10 wings for $6 and also $3 mystery beer night. I had the gold rush and the stingers for the wing flavors and I believe I like the gold rush a tad more. But a friend told me recently to try the Blackened wings add buffalo, so pumped for that on my next visit.  Their white russians here are also very tasty and better yet this place is named after and themed to one fantastic movie: The Big Lebowski.   \"Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man.\" -- The Dude"}
{"text":"Came for the wings...duh. Fantastic! My family is from Rochester MY, so I have definitely gone and had real Buffalo wings from the source. It's been impossible to replicate down south...but these. These are damn close. Good prices, great service. We brought our dog who we also usually order food for (I know. it's absurd. We are those people.)...and I was going to pay for an entire kids meal or something and they offered a better solution since I guess we aren't the only crazy customers who do this. The food was even served in a dog bowl!! I did not request that but she loved it! I hope the chef doesn't get offended by cooking for a dog because we thought every thing was fantastic and it just added to our experience. Thank you Lebowskis!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! I feel like I am at home here, such a cozy little spot! Food is GREAT! I have never ordered anything I didn't like - I enjoy the fact that many of the dishes have a home style flare to them. BEST WINGS IN CHARLOTTE! Hands down - try the Carolina Gold - you will LOVE Them.   I work for a nonprofit organization and Lebowskis has been very helpful to us, allowing us to host events there and providing apps for our clients. This is a family run business and this family is TOP NOTCH. Good people.   My husband and I love this place so much we had our rehearsal dinner on the patio this spring.   Check them out - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite cheat meal ~ a good old fashioned #cheeseburger & fries!  This is my first time Lebowski's Grill & their burger did not disappoint! And thx to Yelp, I got free garlic fries, just for checking in!"}
{"text":"If you're going for a Buffalo experience it's a 5-star. If your just out and about CLT it's a 3-star. We were a mix of people so we gave it 4-stars."}
{"text":"As the name says, it is indeed your neighborhood grill. The wait time wasn't long on a Friday evening and the place even though looks small has enough tables for a lot of people. Stepping inside you already get a feeling of a friendly make-yourself-at-home atmosphere and not like a chain restaurant. It is one of those places where you could order a drink and a meal, get nostalgic and talk for hours with your friends. Our waitress was friendly but did seem a bit anxious about getting orders right. I got the burger with a side of homemade chilli. The turn around time was quick and the burger tasted okay but not the best. I may have to come back here and try out a different dish. The restaurant is laid back and friendly, yes I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Being a Buffalo native, I love Lebowski's! The food is good and well priced and the atmosphere is awesome. One of my favorite movies is the Big Lebowski!"}
{"text":"Lebowski's is my favorite bar in the Dilworth area. It's what I like to call a \"feel good\" bar. They have really good bar food - you can't go wrong with the apps, wraps, sandwiches, or wings and they also have a solid beer selection. I've always had great service here. There are plenty of tv's to watch the game and they have a nice dog friendly patio. This place has a great atmosphere for all."}
{"text":"Decent food. I went here with a few friends the other night and ordered their world famous wings and fried fish. It was good but not world famous..."}
{"text":"Charlotte has some very heavy competition when it comes to wings.  Go ahead and Google \"Best wings in Charlotte\", and most every site will have Lebowski's listed towards the top.   In my quest to hit every wing joint in CLT, I finally found myself on that side of town.   I wanted to see if the hype was real, I wanted to confirm what other Yelp reviewers had confirmed, that this was one of the Wing Mecca's of CLT.     So 3 star is for service, both my wife and my orders came out wrong and getting the server back to rectify the issue was a chore.  They were not that busy, so I am a little confused as to where the server vanished too.    My wife ordered the Buffalo Chicken wrap, but  instead of Buffalo sauce, she asked for the Stinger sauce (sweet heat) - the dish came out with neither sauces.  Also, why is there an up charge on this dish for fries?   Chips suck.  $1.29 up-charge is ridiculous.   Kudos to them for having a Yelp check-in offer that covers the cost.   But really, chips?    My gripe is I ordered wings with blue cheese and it was served with no blue cheese.   I know right?  Come on......I also ordered my fries tossed in the Garlic-Parm dry rub, that was missed too.     I went with the Buffalo Trifecta.......  But I really was here for Wings!!!!!  Okay, better than average.   Are they top ten, possible.   Are they top five, I could make a pretty strong argument that there are better wing spots.   But, in my view, as a true wing connoisseur, I find it baffling that they only offer six flavors.  Maybe they feel they have \"dialed in\" the basic flavors?   I dunno.  I went with the Garlic-Parm.   The dry rub was excellent, the wings perfectly cooked, not over crispy.     Just to confirm, the WINGS ARE EXCELLENT.   It was just not as earth shattering, to die for - I gotta drive all the way back to this spot to get my wing-on perfection.  A few other random comments for you, if you even read this far down:  The Haddock fish is fabulous, I would go there again and get this as a main dish.   Many reviewers have Yelped about the Haddock, my stamp of approval, white flaky with a perfectly lightly battered breading that is not fishy tasting one bit.   As of matter of fact, I was just in London for a week, and Lebowski's can hang with any of the Brits Fish n Chips.  Again, as many of the Yelpers commented, the Beef on Weck was tasteless.   I found it ultra bland.  There are better choices on the menu, just saying.  French fries are very good.  Ultra crispy.   Yum...   Great choice of local craft beers, six taps with two rotating.  It is definitely a cool, really great place to relax with friends."}
{"text":"Interesting place, they have a whole section of the menu dedicated to speciality white russians. I had the Lebowski burger with garlic fries. Burger was fine overall with the exception of the grainy and somewhat off-putting  \"queso sauce\". Fries were really good, had that nice double fried crunch. Overall pretty standard fare from this neighborhood Buffalo bar."}
{"text":"Lebowski s...... I have been visiting this place for more than 5 years now, is a local neighborhood place, that can beat any of the american food chain in Charlotte. The hamburgers and chicken wings are amazingly well prepared, don t despite other items in their menu. The crew is very friendly and they will make your eating experience a pleasant one. Totally recommended, if you want to  experience the local american flavors"}
{"text":"Lebowski's is one of those restaurants where I always think about switching up my order and not getting the same thing every time.  But then I remember how good the beef on weck sandwich is, and I order it again and again and again.    They piled your weck roll high with thin sliced, already dipped in au jus roast beef.  (They'll give you more au jus for .49 cents extra, you don't reallllly need it, but I always get it anyway).  The employees are usually very friendly.  Last night we were seated inside, but right next to the patio door.  Every time the door opened you could smell someone's cigarette, when we asked to move the hostess was happy to accommodate us, and we slid over a few tables.  This place is a great neighborhood stop for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The only reason they don't have 5 stars is because I'm a hard core dolphins fan and didn't realize how serious of a bills fan stop this was.   First off, the Chilli Mac n Cheese alone makes it worth stopping here. Unique local beer options at a pretty reasonable price.   The roast beef sandwich dipped in the au jus sauce and horsey sauce was amazing! So tender and the wek bun soft and warm.   The haddock has such a good flavor to it and the perfect amount of crispy."}
{"text":"Lebowskis is known for there wings but I like their burgers. I ordered a medium burger and got a medium well burger. Ok. I can handle that. It was also a little salty, but I can handle that too. My biggest beef with lebowskis is this. We chose to sit outside, because inside didn't have room for a table for 5. They don't have a sctrict enough policy on dogs. There where 3 dogs in this area and all of them where  barking and being very Annoying. They offered water bowls so there was a dog 2 feet away from us sloppily drinking water and shaking water everywhere. It is pretty gross. I mean this doesn't change my rating. They are still really good. But the dogs where a nuisance to everybody who didn't have the dog. And then parking. ABHORENT parking. There are about 15 spaces and only one exit/entrance that has parallel parking where another lane would go. So it is just one lane in and out. The service was great and the food was pretty good too. Im not saying I wouldn't return, but I would return more often if these things where fixed eventually."}
{"text":"After a few more trips to Lebowski's, I've gotta up my stars to five. The atmosphere is cozy and fun, the food is way better than typical bar food, and the service is pretty much on-point. Throw in some crazy cheap prices, and Lebowksi's is knocking it out of the park."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Charlotte!  Absolutely obsessed with this place.  Best wings ever (buffalo, extra crispy) and garlic fries - my order every time.  I won't order wings anywhere else.  I've had bites of other items and they're amazing too.  The Lebowski Caucasian is my favorite white russian on the menu.  I can't believe more people don't know about this place."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game, grab some grub, hang with friends and play trivia. The wings are solid and the garlic fries are great. Make sure to ask them about their daily drink specials. This is considered the Charlotte Buffalo Bills bar for any Bills fans out there."}
{"text":"I don't know why I've never written a review expressing our love for this restaurant!  We've been coming here since they opened, and, although we don't go out to eat very often, this is our go-to place for special events when we want to have a good time, eat good food, get great service and relax.  I usually get a fish plate, or the chicken wings, which are some of the BEST in Charlotte!  The Burgers are of course delicious, and the plates are plentiful.  They have a good selection of draft beers and a full bar with a variety of signature drinks.  It's just a great place all the way around and we hope it sticks around for a long time."}
{"text":"The Jerk Burger never disappoints, it's my go-to here!  Fries fresh and fried to perfect crispness. The wings, salads and haddock fish plate also on point .  What I love about this place is it's unpretentious neighborhood hangout vibe and awesome service   What more could you ask for ? *****"}
{"text":"Love this place..just had fish tacos for lunch. I should have written this review a long time ago, as it's become quite a regular spot for me.   While many assume it's a pun on the movie, it's really a Buffalonian's Hot Spot at heart. Featuring wings, beef on wecks, and haddock fish fry, you would most likely get the same response from anyone that's from upstate NY, Lebowski's is where it's at! I'm not from Buffalo, so I speak only on hear say from other folks I've met around CLT. Growing up here in Charlotte, I must say they rank among the top of my favorite Chicken Wing spots. That Jerkiyaki is off the charts. For the vegetarians out there, they actually have some great veggie options as well, and their Mission Bay Salad (I add haddock) is ridiculous.   Yes the Dude Abides! They do play a little off of the movie featuring The Dude, for all you Big Lebowski lovers. You'll find several movie references mixed in with the Buffalo decor and fan fare. With several specialty White Russians, this place a must if you like a good Caucasion to sip on. Great beer options as well, both local and national craft options, along with all your standards.  Staff is laid back, but personable and helpful if you need any suggestions. There is a lot to choose from on the menu."}
{"text":"I went here on Monday, Jan. 6, 2014 with my Groupon deal.  It was kind of slow and not as spacious.  I tried Sicilian wings, a salad and a sandwich.  The Sicilian chicken wings were different but the taste was not as I pictured.  I will give them 5 points for the salad and presentation.  The sandwich will be an acquired taste.  Overall, I would go back again to watch the game."}
{"text":"Good food , horrible service, and it's freezing inside!!! Super excited about grabbing a bite to eat at the local tavern and waited forever after asking a minute to look over the menu.......worse mistake ever. Hopefully won't have to be an option anymore on east Blvd."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy neighborhood restaurant in downtown Charlotte. I loved the atmosphere, and the fried pickles were great. I had high expectations for the fried haddock based on previous reviews and marked as a house favorite-it was good, not amazing. Maybe the breading wasn't my favorite? I couldn't really put my finger on it. The garlic fries were also pretty good, and the boneless medium wings were spicier than expected (but still tasty). The coleslaw however, I hated. The vinegar was really strong in it, and to be fair, I'm hard to please with coleslaw to begin with. Overall I would still come back to try other foods. The staff was friendly and attentive. Wish there were half stars to bump up this rating a little more."}
{"text":"Several visits here. A solid beer selection and 1/2 price wings on Wed. They also do a mystery beer thing on Wed. You pick the genre and they bring you a surprise."}
{"text":"As my dukedom would indicate, I'm a fan of this place.   I'll try to get through this entire review without dropping any cheesy Big Lebowski references....Well, okay, maybe a couple.   My favorite night to come here is on Wednesday night, as they have half priced wings & a \"mystery\" craft beer special. It's a great way to inexpensively sample your way through the wing combos, and taste a few unique brews along the way; I've definitely stumbled upon some really great beers this way. I wouldn't think that you MUST order a White Russian while you're here, but if you do--they are on special for a reduced price as well . Personally, I'm not much of a fan of the caucasian...but you know, that's just like, my opinion man.   As for the other menu items besides the (oh so delicious) wings, Lebowski's serves up an array of bar food from the Upstate NY region. I'm talkin' Beef on Weck, White Hots, Fish Fry...you get my drift. I'm sure you can definitely come in here on Sunday, watch the Bills lose, drown your sorrows in massive amounts of Blue Light & Genny Cream Ale, and talk about where you were when Frank Reich led the comeback against the Oilers.   So, if this all sounds like fun (and it should), you should definitely check them out. FYI, the parking lot can fill up in a hurry, so just be prepared to find a spot down the street if you can't get in their actual lot."}
{"text":"As a born and raised upstate New York girl, and a recent transplant to Charlotte, I was overjoyed when I heard about this place!  I went with my roommate, and introduced her to some of the food I grew up on!  I chose the \"Taste of Buffalo\" to get a taste of it all.  It included wings, a haddock fish fry (the only fish to fry in my opinion) and a beef on weck slider as well as french fries.  As an extremely picky wing eater, I have to say that the wings reminded me of home...I opted for just \"hot\" which is classic for Buffalo.  The fish was on the smaller side, but was tasty, and they have it every night, unlike at home (usually Fridays only).  The beef on weck was also delish.  Only downfall- we had a coupon but found out it was only valid on certain nights.  Lots of Buffalo Bills stuff inside....felt like home!    My rommate got some sort of sandwich, and also really enjoyed it.  There was a dip on the menu called \"The Fredonia.\"  My sister went to school at Fredonia, so I took a picture of it on the menu and sent it to her!  She got a kick out of it for sure!  If you are an upstater, as a lot of we are in Charlotte, check it out, I don't think you will be disspointed!"}
{"text":"Lebowski's has earned another star :-)  When you walk in, the decor is so basic and homey. There are certainly no frills at this place, but the food is great. Staff is cool and the whole vibe is just so laid back. It is all table seating (+ of course the small bar) & the dining area is very open.  ...This time I had a Greek salad w/ grilled chicken. It was humongous and sooo good. Sometimes when a place throws some chicken on a salad, the chicken is so bland, as if just for the sake of having it on there. Here though, the chicken actually had flavor.  I also had some of the Trio Dip Platter and it was equally de-lish. (And) very well could have served as the entree.  This is the type of place where you wanna get what you had the last time because it was so good, but then again wanna try something else because it all looks so appetizing.  Here, I would say it is pretty safe to experiment a bit. They seem to know what they are doing and aren't stingy about it either!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff!  Excellent service and a great meal!  Who could ask for more?  My favorite meal is beef on weck w au jus...always tasty!"}
{"text":"Went during prime dinner time hour on a Saturday evening and was pleasantly surprised at the lack of wait. We were seated immediately in the patio area, which was lovely because the weather was very agreeable, i.e. not ridic humid and hot. Our drink orders were taken immediately, but the waitress took forever getting back to us for our meal orders. Had to wait another eternity (or what felt like eternity because I was starving) for the food to come. Had the garden burger veracruz style with a side of mac n cheese. Burger was not bad but not super memorable because I was already on the verge of forgetting I had eaten it the moment I finished devouring it. Mac n cheese was nothing special either, but plus points for using curly macaroni that held in more cheese than elbow mac. My friend got their \"Legendary Wings\" and thought they were delicious, but not legendary. Not a place I'd have cravings for, but still a solid neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"We love take- out at Lebowski since we have kids. We love the Kenmore special on Fri nights with haddock, wings, fries for 12.95 We love mild, stinger, and gold rush flavored wings. Nice people!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Seems a bit over rated as I think 3 stars is deserved. If you've never been then certainly pay them a visit. Decent beer selection and varied menu in a pretty laid back setting. We had the beef on weck, beef and provolone sandwich, and BBQ sandwich --- nothing special but not bad. Fries were not to our liking, tater tots were yummy, Mac n cheese was OK. 3 solid stars."}
{"text":"UYE @Lebowski's 10/18/2009;      If you look at the name Lebowski's \" Grill and Pub \" its very deceiving....   I bet within a 1 mile radius  there is( Dave help me out) 30 or more places that  A)Serve Food B) Serve drinks and or combination of both so I guess it comes down to this.        If your going out to have a meal why settle for food that is not cooked  basically reheated ?  Diners want quality not something that was driven or flown half way across the county  just so it can make it to your plate! If you haven't been to Lebowski's for a meal or appetizers the last time you \" Go\" to where ever you \"Go\" just ask as I did and the taste tells \" what is actually cooked?\" .Then they will be glad to have you as a \" regular\" at Lebowsk'is!         If it's Spirits that your out for when was the last time you visited your \" Favorite Place\" and did not have something to eat? So we are back at square one.Why lower your expectations of the food just because, your having Drinks?You should not have too!!         When you go to Lebowski's you will learn very  very quickly as did our group of YELPERS  that this is a place that we will return to..."}
{"text":"We got to restaurant at a busy time and was seated promptly outside. The atmosphere was cozy, we came with 2 children and our table was too small. We received our drinks quickly but had to wait 15 min to place our order but it was 8 on a Saturday evening so that was fine. After receiving someone else's food from a food runner we finally received our wings and the our meal. The wings were very good, the side salad was good, and all of our meals were delicious actually. My husband and I alone may return here due to the food being very good and they had a good beer selection but we will not be taking our children again. My sons kid meal was $10.25 2 sliders and apples. My daughters grilled cheese and fries was $7.75 that's including their $2.25 charge for drinks. My 7 year old could have eaten at Capital Grill for a lower price. There again great Grill restaurant but not affordable to take children."}
{"text":"We both had the Angus burger patty with salad and it was great.  The burgers were cooked well and very tasty.   Had the charbroiled taste...excellent."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife of Friday and I was blown away by their wings, food is great, turkey slider I recomend. Definitely  going back soon."}
{"text":"We went with a group of 8. It was trivia night (score!) which is always a good time. However, the only cheery staff member there seemed to be the guy running the Trivia night... the rest of the servers acted like being at Lebowskis was the last thing they wanted to do, were incredibly slow, and ... just didn't smile. I mean, a smile goes a LONG way is all I'm saying.  On to the food!  I'm a wing junkie so naturally we ordered some wings for appetizers. And of course, a round of drinks. Our drinks arrived much later than they should have considering we were right next to the bar and everyone was focused on the trivia... We were really hungry and really looking forward to those carolina gold and hot wings that... never arrived. Our burgers showed up first.   I ordered the Jerk Style Burger with onions, very very tastey! I had never tried anything like it and there wasn't a crumb left. This burger has won awards, you should try it!  Back to the wings--we were told there was a \"communication error\" with the computers and the kitchen never got our wing order. They would be \"right out.\" We informed our server (again) that those were appetizers and our meal was already here. We weren't impressed and let him know. Our wings came out, and were comped. They were delicious and ended up being dessert for the crew.  In short--the food was great but the service was... not enthusiastic or speedy by any means. I'll definitely go back, but I expect better service, Lebowskis!"}
{"text":"Like the movie from which this bar takes it's nominal inspiration, Lebowski's is fun, quirky and surprisingly substantial. It's a neighborhood bar, where you can easily feel like a regular on your first visit. The staff is friendly and attentive, even when the small dining area is packed.  The menu consists of typical bar fair.  They don't try to elevate it, or reinterpret it.. Just do it really well. The wings are said to be the best in Charlotte, which I can't argue.. They are really good wings. I enjoy the Carolina Gold Rush, a mustard-based sauce.    There seems to be drink specials every day.. At least there have been every time I visit. My favorite is Mystery Beer Monday: you tell the bartender what you like and he/she will pick something for you. What a great way to try new brews?!  The Lebowski inspired artwork livens the environment. If only there was a bowling alley!"}
{"text":"THE DUDE is in town!  I love going to this place.  The décor is amazing if you like The Big Lebowski.  I try to buy the John Goodman pixel painting but it's a staple to the restaurant.  They have many different varieties of things to order whether for lunch or dinner.  I usually go with the three sliders so I can have a different taste of multiple things.  My wife usually gets the fish and fries and douses them in vinegar.  They are excellent!  It's not a very big place but if you go at the right times you shouldn't have that long of a wait."}
{"text":"Amazing Bar & Grill with incredible food for a bar atmosphere. This is one of my favorite places to go in Charlotte on any night of the week there are specials to be had. Trivia on Tuesday is always fun and is an ideal spot for both a low key dinner but also an excellent nightlife location! I highly recommend Lebowski's!"}
{"text":"Lebowski or should I say Lee- average?  Service here is like an old, coal freight train, at first wasn't getting any traction.  We weren't even noticed, we sat in the corner like an neglected red headed step child.  But, once we were noticed, the service started rolling at a steady pace.  The atmosphere was comfortable like any basic neighborhood bar.  The outside patio, is outside.  The place needs more TVs and although regulars and locals go here, it felt a little bit congested inside.  It had a nice rug that tied the room together.    All of the food were spin offs from the movie for the most part.  However, I chose the Jerk style burger and like honest Abe, I can't tell a lie.  It was wicked good.  The jerkiyaki glaze, pineapple and pepper- jack was more on point than a German Short-hair.  I don't know if it's because I ask for a medium cooked burger or if it was from all of the sauce but the bun was a little soggy like a Cherri-o left in a cereal bowl.  But I ate every bite. Take note, the chips are from a bag you'd find in a pantry and not housemade.  Lastly the White Russian.  Oh the White Russian.  Like a keystone in an arch, without the White Russian to lean on, this place would crumble.  But my God, the White Russian here are something out of a dream.  The Dude would be impressed and proud.  Best White Russian I have ever had and best in Charlotte.  I recommend going here strictly to try it.  Overall, Lebowski's is a very chill, easy- going, laid back, average, neighborhood bar.  Probably won't change ever and everyone is happy the way it is.  I recommend going there with the boys for a burger and of course a While Russian.  But if you are trying to watch a game, not the best option.   Once the service gets started, it's not half bad.  Thanks for the White Russians Lebowski's."}
{"text":"Note to people that have expense reports!!!  They PRINT THE DETAIL OF THE CHECK ON EVERY CREDIT CARD RECEIPT COPY.  If you travel for work, you need to know this, AND I WISH I KNEW THIS BEFORE I ORDERED. I have never had this problem in any other restaurant, anywhere, and I travel weekly.   The place is cozy, and the menu selections are numerous.   Lots of TV's = good views from every seat in the place.   I had a beef on weck with added cheese and horseradish. I think it was called a Franciscan. I was pretty good, but I think I would order something else next time.   The Mac and Cheese with bacon was really good!  Beer selection is extensive, and red wine by the glass is 8 bucks, with several good choices.   The service was friendly, but it was pretty relaxed. If it was lunchtime, I would have dinged them for it, but it was just fine with me as I wanted to watch a few sporting events.   Next time I will try their wings, as other reviewers said they were great."}
{"text":"Swung in for a Saturday night dinner and the host had us seated in less than 10 mins. Quick peruse of the menu and decided to go with the \"Buffalo Trifecta\" and was not disappointed by the platter of 6 wings, a beef slider, and two pieces of white fish along with fries was more than enough to get my fill (and in reality could probs be split for two). The entire plate was good but will say the buffalo wings stood out as being exceptional to the rest.  2¢- Saturday is $2 BL bottles  which paired perfectly with the setting and dinner"}
{"text":"Cool little neighborhood bar.  Went there to watch part of a football game.  We were quickly greeted and sat on the patio.   We were offered water but that was the last we saw of our server for a while.  We decided on our food but she never came back.  We placed the menus on the table- maybe she thought we were still deciding.  We stacked the menus on top of each other- never saw her.  Eventually, we had to grab someone, anyone, to take our order. I had a burger (jerk style I think).  It was great.  I could have eaten 2 or 3 of them.  Someone else had the wings- they looked great and I'll be ordering them next time.  Other than waiting for what seemed like forever to place my order, I had a good experience here.  The food was good and they had a nice selection.  I will return to this place in the future."}
{"text":"I met my friend for lunch here with a Creative Loafing Deal and was pleasantly surprised to see that it was quite crowded! The menu had a variety of yumminess and I opted for a side salad and the French dip.  Oh wow! Again, happily surprised! My friend ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and it was also delicious.  The CLT deal cost $7.50 and paid for our whole meal (worth $25) so it was one of the least expensive and best lunches I've had in Dilworth!  The service was prompt and attentive..... A definite Keeper for a speedy and filling lunch!"}
{"text":"Always good food and service.  Excellent fish and chips."}
{"text":"Where have I been? I Lebowski's is now one of my favorite places to grab a bite! I've heard a lot about them and seen them on east blvd but this is my 1st time eating there and I must say the wings are amazing and my chicken sandwich was a pleasant surprise and my wife fell in love with the cilantro lime salad dressing! I'm telling everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my staples in Charlotte.  Their weekly specials are a hit! I love getting the haddock taco and the jerkiyaki wings.  All of their food is really delicious.  I come here pretty frequently, and we even went for new years eve.  It was perfect! Not a huge crowd, everyone was out partying the night away. I think they were gonna close early, but it was nice to still be able to go out and enjoy a quick bite to eat.  The fact that they are open later than most food spots in the area is perfect.  My go to for late night snacks. They also carry options from local breweries which is always nice."}
{"text":"Not my favorite.  I've been in twice now and each time I was really uninspired with the food I ordered.  It's pretty standard bar food but there was no wow factor.  The second time I went in was a total bummer.  I was strugglin' that day and just needed something delicious.  I ordered the nachos which arrived cold, as in the artificial cheese (like snack booth style) was COLD.  The server didn't really seem to care which didn't really help make matters any better.  Weak Sauce."}
{"text":"Lebowskis is my new favorite comfort place. I only wish I lived in walking distance. Very fresh vegetables can always be found in the salads. This last time I ordered the vegetable pita and it was fresh and just right. Lebowskis is perfect for late night food. Kyle is an excellent bartender, he made me feel welcome the first time I visited and recognized me the next visit. I feel very comfortable at Lebowskis."}
{"text":"Incredible. Service was on point. Prices are perfect. Food was amazing. I can't be more impressed with a small business in a big city. Hand on heart, new favorite place."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place on East Blvd (walking distance from my place) to grab great food and drinks with friends. The only bad thing I would say is, don't expect them to be able to accommodate large crowds without a reservation. But that's it! Best chicken wings and fries!"}
{"text":"Servers were nice and attentive, the draft beer was tasty, and the trivia fun. Will return. I didn't eat anything this time, but i have in the past. I had the Beef on Weck and it was tasty. I would return again and try something different."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful day in Charlotte and I decided to take a walk up to East Blvd. and grab a bite to eat...so it was between Lebowski and its neighbor, they won... I ordered the Memphis with garlic fries. The sandwich was okay, perfectly grilled bread but the pulled pork was not as tender as I'd like, but the BBQ sauce was delicious, sweet with just enough tang to it, that and the garlic French fries were what earned them a 4 star! The fries were served fresh and hot and with a just right crunch and the perfect amount of seasoning."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant while on business.  The folks I went with spoke very highly of the restaurant and said the best time to get there is before 12.  I tried their sliders and had the Beef on Weck; meatloaf sandwich; and honey butter chicken.  They were all very good and my favorites were the roast beef and honey butter chicken.  The roast beef was very moist and the honey butter chicken is just awesome!  I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"So good! I live in Dilworth but today was my first time at Lebowskis. I had the sliders and they were amazing! The turkey was my favorite though the chicken parm was delightful. Service was great.. Attentive and polite. Great place!"}
{"text":"Food is always great, Thomas the bartender awesome, I come here often and don't plan on stopping anywhere else on east Blvd."}
{"text":"Went to lunch on New Year's Eve which likely was our hundredth time here.  Good as usual - beer is always good and we enjoy the turkey burger or Greek pita.  While the owners haven't said boo to us over the last couple of years, ever, Lizzy is our usual server and  we appreciate her remembering us and her wanting to be our server.  We come in to see her.  Unfortunately, she wasn't here this day.  Menu options are getting old and with new competition, we may not be as frequent dinners as we have in the past."}
{"text":"This place is a total neighborhood joint. A diehard buffalo bills bar, this place serves some of the best wings I've ever had in my life. The Gold rush and garlic parm wings are good but the Jerkiyaki are AMAZING."}
{"text":"Gave it another shot after receiving poor service one day and I'm thinking it was just a bad day. Service was much better. The food was good as always.   Love their garlic fries and beef in a Weck. Their buffalo chicken wrap is also great.  The atmosphere is family friend with a neighborhood appeal. Great place for lunch or casual  dinner."}
{"text":"Great food & a decent beer menu. My only complaint would be they need more room but again that is part of the charm of the place."}
{"text":"OMG the roast beef sandwich is amazing and the wings I think are the best in CLT. Be mindful this is a whole in the wall place, but really good food. Open late"}
{"text":"Great food, low key vibe. Love this place. Great place for any Upstate New Yorker who resides in the Charlotte area to get some home style wings and bar food. Also, who can beat $2 Labatt's anytime down South?"}
{"text":"Heard about this place recently, and seeing as how the owners are from my hometown - Buffalo, NY! - I had to try it! I was so excited to see familiar things on the menu like beef on weck , haddock fish fry and hot Buffalo wings! Let's just say I had all three. With a side of awesome fries.  SO good! The hot wings were really hot but good, not too salty. Just like we do in B-Lo! The fish was perfectly flaky and crispy. We visited on a Thursday night at about 10:00 and they were still going strong, not crowded, but not empty either.  I loved it and will definitely return."}
{"text":"We're from Buffalo. Not impressed at all with food. Wings just OK. Fish fry not up to par with original \"Friday Fish Fry\" found in Buffalo. Weck slider just OK. Garlic fries good. Biggest disappointment was that wings were ordered \"extra extra\" crispy and they were. not even crispy.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Since the reviews of this place was all great, my husband and I decided to check it out. We almost missed it! The restaurant was EMPTY when we got there. At first when we passed, it seemed like they were closed. We walk in and they were eager to see us since we were their 1st customers of the night.....at 7pm.  The restaurant was is pretty small, but it felt comfortable. We get seated and put in our drink orders (and my drink was never empty! It would get down to about 3/4 full and our waitress would bring me a new one). We order the hummus dip as a starter and despite the fridge taste, it was pretty good. I like the flat bread better than the chips they serve.   I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap in a tortilla and blue cheese. As a side, I get the mac n cheese which was outstanding. My husband ordered the Beef on Weck. He didn't like the amount of salt that was on the bun, but he said overall it was very good. He also got the mac n cheese and that's all he would talk about. We split a spinach salad that had red onions and cranberries. This was a refreshing addition to our meal.  The only thing I didn't like is they didn't have the NFL network, instead they had NHL because the owners were from Buffalo, NY. I highly recommend anybody to stop by here, it's a great place to eat and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"I've been to Lebowski's a couple of times now. I've always had a nice meal here and sitting on the patio during warmer months is a great treat!  I've had a salad, their trio (had to try the famous beef on weck!), but the veggie panini is my favorite.  Beer selection is good, and the bartender let me try a new flavor before ordering a full glass (good thing, because I wasn't a fan and ordered my usual OMB Copper!).  Service is sometimes slow but the staff is friendly, and I'm happy to support this local, family-owned place."}
{"text":"You know, it's a great hangout with great tv's & a friendly (if somewhat, slow) staff.  Our server was good initially with some great beer recommendations (Long Board & Oberon).  We ordered and our beers came quickly enough, but we were more than halfway through our beers before we got our order, which was 1/2 an hour or more.  They weren't busy and we were turning around in our seats looking for a waitress for awhile.  Other servers noticed us looking around for her, but didn't say anything.    When she came past our table, she kind of stared at the table top... as if she realized she hadn't brought our food, or had forgotten to put it in.  They weren't busy at all.  We only ordered a Halibut Taco for me & a Chicken Taco for him.  The side that comes with it is nacho chips w/salsa, so it shouldn't have taken that long.  We got our second beers before we got our food.  That being said, she was friendly & apologized for the wait.  The tacos were really good.  Especially the Halibut one.  Big chunks of white fish, lightly, lightly crisped... it was almost like eating chunks of crab.  I really liked the chili-lime aioli...not too spicy or citrusy.  I'd definitely go back for that.  Oh, the food we were craving was hot dogs, which is why we chose Lebowski's.  They don't sell them anymore :(  The server said they were \"Severs\" (?) brand & Food Lion has them.  Ah well."}
{"text":"I'm a buffalonian so of course I cannot rate this place any less than a 5! Makes me feel right at home from the atmosphere to the food. Wings were pretty good for the south. I am very picky and could've been a little more crispy but the best I've had in Charlotte so far! I also had the beef on week slider. This was pretty good again for being in the south I'm just amazed at all they have it and obviously have had better in buffalo but I will take what I can get. For those that haven't had buffalo food this comes in a pretty good second! The service was also fantastic. I will say one bartender for a completely packed out place makes you worried but she was super attentive and did not make you wait for anything! Will 100% be back to this place!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on a whim yesterday after my sons music class and boy am I glad we did!  Lebowski's would certainly make \"The Dude\" proud.  Laid back atmosphere with killer food.  Next time I'm wearing my robe...  Loved the Christmas lights lining the ceiling and carpet throughout the restaurant.  I ended up getting the Dixie Style burger adding Pimento cheese and a side of Mac and Cheese with Pecan Bacon.  Even though the burger wasn't the best I've had in Charlotte it was still really good.  The Pimento Cheese worked really well with the chili (how could it not?).  The Mac and Cheese was also really good - some of the best I've had.  The noodles were cooked just right (al dente) and the bacon to cheese ratio was just right."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood bar with decent food. We started with the wings. They were good but not amazing. I was disappointed that they did not allow me to order all flats. Craving more buffalo action, I ordered the buffalo wrap. Skip the lettuce and add the fries. It was delicious and loaded with breaded chicken breast chunks and tomatoes and buffalo sauce. My friends enjoyed their dinners also and ordered the mystery beer special where the bartender selects the beer. It worked because they enjoyed the selection. I will be back to try other entrees."}
{"text":"We discovered Lebowski's Grill about 2 months ago and started becoming a regular to hear Jeff Brown, a talented local musician who plays here on Thursdays with an eclectic music selection, as well as his own stuff.  This definitely fits the bill for a neighborhood bar.  It's quite a cozy and friendly place.  The food here is excellent and they have quite a bit to offer for vegetarians.  I love the pimento & cheese burger which, like all of their burgers, can be made vegetarian.  The outdoor seating area is shaded and covered and a great spot to be on cooler evenings.  They have quite a few micro brews on tap, including the Charlotte-brewed OMB (Olde Mecklenburg Brewery), Two-Hearted Ale, and Fat Tire among others.  The owner is a music fan and you can see some of his extensive album collections on the walls.  The only addition is that they need a bike rack in the front."}
{"text":"Hmm maybe I'm just not used to a SUPER casual place, because this place has pretty decent reviews but for my opinion was a little disappointing. My husband though it was ok, the food and service was good.   This is what bothers me, cleanliness and upkeep. As we walked through their parking lot the smell of garbage was palpable and walking in is just clutter all around, the place is pretty small, brooms and cleaning items where at plain view of the clients  We decided to sit outside and it was not appealing at all  the owners should invest some money here, this a pretty decent area by Dilworth. Anyhow please try the place you may like it."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar, the beef on weck is solid and the wings are as good as any I have ever had. Very happy with the customer service and will definitely be back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"I have now been to Lebowski's twice for trivia on Tuesday night and I've become a huge fan. It is really a great neighborhood bar and doesn't disappoint on food or drink specials. First time around I ordered the Haddock Fish Fry and was impressed at how delicious it was. The seasoned fries were delicious, the fried haddock was crunchy and flaky, and the homemade tartar sauce was just outstanding.  Big shout-out to the wings, which I got on my second visit. They really sauce them up and they are fried to perfection. The drink specials are great too, with $4 white russians every single day (and they are damn tasty) and $3 Fat Tire pints on Tuesdays.  This is a great establishment. Don't miss out on the awesome food and drink specials!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was really good! It was my first time and I called in my order and Stephanie answered and I had no idea what I was getting but she was so patient and nice ! The food was amazing also! I will be eating there again!! The goldrush sauce is absolutely amazing and the customer service was awesome also! This is a great place to eat !"}
{"text":"Lebowski's is the perfect local neighborhood joint if you want simple american food that is always delicious. This place has a nice atmosphere and felt very cozy. Our waitress was great and was very attentive. I got the wings since i had heard a lot about them and being from the north i was craving simple buffalo wings. They were perfect. Sometimes with buffalo wings they can end up being slimy but these had the perfect amount of the Mild Buffalo sauce to give them a kick but to not overwhelm me. While i was perfectly happy with the basket of 6 wings my dad opted for 10 and finished them all off. I guess it depends on how hungry you are and what you get for a side. While my dad got the garlic fries, which are DELICIOUS, i got the mac & cheese with pecan bacon, because bacon is everything. My mom went for the junior Haddock Fish fry which was amazing as well. Lebowski's is definitely on the top of my list now when i want some great all american food for a great price! YUM!"}
{"text":"A very solid 3.5 ...  Atmosphere- My mom would hate it because it is a bit older and has a mildew(y)  scent. I on the other hand see it as eclectic...they had some Bob Marley playing and of course The Dude plastered just about everywhere. The Sabres banner didn't hurt either (I'm a UB grad ).  The bathroom was clean and overall the restaurant was tidy.   Food- I loved the B-lo touches. Franks, Sahlen's, Weber's...they've got it covered. I went with the Fredonia; a beef on weck of sorts served with horsey, melted provolone, au jus, pressed like a panini in a hoagie (sprinkled with caraway and coarse salt). I loved the au jus but I like my horsey straight on horseradish(y) aka much spicier. I will say their garlic fries were some of the best I've ever tasted. I splashed those suckers with malt vinegar and I was in heaven. My other half got a fish fry, he didn't seem too thrilled about it and he is pretty easy to please. He mistook the  beer bottle for the malt vinegar and still ate the fries though,that's how good they were!   Drinks- They had a special running that day, Monday $3 bartender bottles choice (meaning the bartender chooses a new beer each time). They weren't Miller Lite's and we were able to give a little direction on our choice (We were given Pilsner Urquell and a Ranger IPA). No complaints in that department : )   Service- We had a younger gentleman serve us, and he did a great job. He was very upbeat and friendly. The food came out super-fast (like how'd they do that ? fast)   Just a tip, they have another Monday deal two burgers for $10, I'm sure we'll return to get some of those with plenty of the delicious garlic fries."}
{"text":"I visited here for the first time today. I was veeery  impressed with the taste of the food but disappointed with the small amount of fries they offered for free with the  Yelp coupon .  The meal was still a little pricy. I only ordered a Haddock fish sandwich w/ garlic fries and the total was  $9 and remember the fries were free. I'll definitely visit again but for dinner instead of lunch."}
{"text":"First... Let me just clear it up and say... the BEST Buffalo Wings in Charlotte, NC.  This is a great place to go for dinner, lunch, a quick bite, for bar setting, and for us... football.  This is owned by Buffalo NY natives and keeps true to the tradition of Buffalo.  I don't now of a better Beef on Weck in NC than at Lebowski's.    We were lucky last season when our Chicago Bears played a ton of 4pm games after the Bills.  If you are a Bills fan, there is no better place to be on a Sunday.    We also would recommend the Veggie Pita (which we get in a wrap vs the pita) and the burgers.  Monday is 2 burgers for $10 and 1/2 off wine.  Killer deal.  I believe Wednesday is 1/2 off wings.  Salads are also very good.  Becoming one of our very favorite bars in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is no frills for sure. In a good way. We were looking for somewhere to watch some March Madness and decided we should go to the place that claims to have the best wings in Charlotte. Crowded on a Friday night and we had to wait a little for a table. They have a good bottle/can selection and a whole menu of white russians (of course).   I could have thrown a dart at the menu and been happy with whatever the outcome was. Everything sounded good.   Being there for the duration of the game, we started with wings. Yep, they are good. I loved the hot buffalo sauce, thought the garlic parm dry rub was a little boring. The blue cheese dressing is very good, you can tell its homemade. We also got a small order of the buffalo chicken nachos. Not my favorite since there wasn't any melty cheese to keep the toppings on the chips.   But the crispy haddock. Wow. I would never think to order fish and chips in a restaurant, but I kept seeing everyone's plates come out and it looked amazing. Definitely the best fried fish I have ever had. The tarter sauce it comes with is great and the garlic fries are a must-get! Also split the roast beef on weck. It was really good, I loaded mine up with the horsey sauce.   My only regret is not saving room for a white russian. We enjoyed our meal so much we went back to watch the Sunday game too!   They have great daily food specials and a lot of combination plates when you cant decide what you want. You can even get a combo with fish, a beef on weck slider and 6 wings! Best of everything."}
{"text":"Lebowski's isn't really the type of place that I'd normally stop at, for a couple of reasons.  First and foremost, because I don't get down East Boulevard very often (though I should - more and more places are cropping up that make it interesting).  Secondly, because it's a smallish place that looks a bit more like a pub than a grill, and in my advancing years it's just not where I'd stop for a bite to eat, which is what I'm more after these days than a drink.  That out of the way, when we had an unofficial Yelp gathering the other evening, I'm glad that it was chosen to be at Lebowski's, or we might have missed this hidden gem.  The night started off right with the service.  Amy greeted us right away (well, after Dave S. and Joseph L, but they don't really count, as they aren't employees), introducing herself, asking our names and perhaps most impressively, using our names throughout the time we were there.  Not often that you see that happen these days.  Nicely done!  That was followed up by a creative menu, serving the aforementioned sliders so that you aren't cornered into a single choice that you might not like.  I chose the beef on weck, burger and pulled pork.  They arrived with an impressive array of condiments, but those were scarcely needed - the sliders stood well on their own.  The weck roll doesn't seem to be quite an authentic weck roll, but I'm not an expert, and it serves the purpose well enough.  I probably could have done with another order of sliders, but I saved the extra room for one of the several varieties of White Russians (hey - a place called Lebowski's, and you aren't going to order a White Russian?).  Altogether a pleasant experience, and I'm glad we made the choice.  Parking was also ample, which can be an issue in this area of town.  The only downside is that it's not a larger space (that, and for some I could see it being more bar-like may be an issue).  For our group neither was a problem, but I could see where one might be for others.  I also wish that I had ordered the garlic fries instead of the mac and cheese as a side.  Very tasty (I sampled someone else's)..."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while! We decided to go one night and got sat right away. Restaurant isn't huge or fancy but that's ok because it's locally owned and operated. Our server was awesome! She answered all our questions and she was super friendly!!  I got the 6 wing meal with garlic fries and a weck slider. Wings were awesome. I got it in hot buffalo with a side of ranch. Garlic fries were awesome! Super crispy and not greasy at all! Weck slider was good. Perfect amount! My husband got the grilled chicken sandwich and rice and he really liked it but he really loved my wings. We had no leftovers! I can't wait to go back! I'm gonna get the same thing but try a different slider!"}
{"text":"The sweet potato tots are a must have when choosing a side, thanks in part to the delicious creamy cinnamon dip that accompany them. Pulled pork BBQ sandwich and stingers wings were also delicious! Great, relaxed atmosphere and extensive drink menu."}
{"text":"Don't come on Tuesdays. They reserve the whole restaurant for trivia with only reservations."}
{"text":"If your hands are showing their age and you want that smoothness back, order the fried pickles. They are delicious and so salty, my hands still look like a teenagers' again (#cheatdayperk).  We were regulars at the old Township Grill in Matthews so we're already biased to like this place. Plus, I'm married to a Yankee from around Buffalo so we are always up for wings and weck!  Kids came with us this time, they're finally getting into wings (#parentingdoneright) and we needed some weck.  Sunday at 615p, it was busy but not crazy, we had a table in just a few minutes.  Love the decor, because i love The Dude.  DH and I had the wings and weck, which was good. The weck was not piled high like it used to be, maybe they sensed that portion control is not one of my strong suits? Still tender and amazing. I had the Spots (sweet potato tots, yes i had to ask) which were fine but a small portion.  Kiddos had wings and fries.  It was health food at its finest.  We'll come back on date night for White Russians and that awesome beer menu.  They run specials all week so check it out.  Plus, it's not a chain. #extracredit."}
{"text":"WE loved this place.  The food was great and the service was brisk and friendly.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Always awesome! Kiel, Lizzy and Thomas treat you like family, even if it's your first time at Lebowskis!   Best wings and drinks in Charlotte!   Become a regular after one visit and you'll understand.   SERIOUSLY!!!"}
{"text":"Determined to shake up our Saturday lunch routine, hubs and I stopped by Lebowski's to try their famous wings and take in a bit of college football in the mean time.   The first impression is a bit nondescript - Lebowski's looks like many other sports bars in Charlotte and has a nice little patio facing East Blvd. Because Mother Nature gave us a break from the 90s, we chose to sit outside and enjoy a relaxing lunch (hubs was especially happy as there are TVs outside, too!). Both the hostess and our server weren't the cheeriest of individuals...it seemed like they both had a long night out. Regardless, hubs went with the Carolina Gold wings and the Beef on Weck, I choose a side salad and the small version of the Chili & Mac 'n Cheese.   Upon ordering our server informs us that the wings take about 15-20 minutes to cook. Um...ok...that's a little odd, but we would still like them. This was noon on a Saturday in a not-so-busy restaurants. Now, I'm not a wing eater but even hubs said that that's a long time to wait for six wings. So, basically the entire time we were joking with each other that the cook had to go fetch the chickens and take care of them so he could have his wings in less than 20 minutes.   And yes, it did take 20 minutes for these wings to reach our table. I'll let hubs review his own food. As for mine...the salad was fresh but not too much to report. Their side salad included bits of iceberg and romaine, a flat crostini and a few other veggies.   As for my Chili Mac 'n Cheese, it was pretty tasty albeit the chili was a bit sweet. I had a different expectation...when I saw a cup of chili mac 'n cheese I expected a cup of chili with a bit of mac 'n cheese at the bottom. I was a bit suprised when I saw a flat dish of mac 'n cheese with a small scoop of chili on top. No worries, though, I ate it up - it was a nice little serving.   Will I be back to Lebowski's? Sure...for a few beers and maybe a snack, but I don't think it's going to make it into my trusty lunch spot list."}
{"text":"Only been once, before moving to Alabama for school.   It took awhile for us it get a table, and when did, it was on the patio, which was crammed up feeling since we had 3 people sitting at a 2 person table.    The food was really good, I think I ordered the E-Street as my memory serves me right. Had that with OMB Copper. Love the location, besides finding a parking spot, but that can be anywhere on East blvd."}
{"text":"I LOVE the wings here, unfortunately, I don't love the pricing structure and enforcement of it.  I had first visited a few years back when searching for a great wing restaurant (ECW has some delicious and interesting flavours but doesn't always deliver on quality and doesn't hit the basic Buffalo flavour too well) in the Charlotte area. I entered the establishment on a crowded weekend night, and saw that it was full, so I approached the hostess. I told her that I wanted place an order for two 10 pieces to go and she offered that the 25 wing order that was cheaper than two-ten pieces.  I took her up on the offer and in the meantime decided to eat my wings there (minimal service, which was to be expected on a carry-out changed dine-in).  All was well said and done.  I have ordered take-out on several other occasions and everything has been great.  This past Sunday I had promised to take my Mom to experience her best \"Buffalo Wings\" experience yet; Stateside outside of Buffalo. We arrived, navigated the difficult and misleading parking lot, and walked in, to be greeted by the typical [upfront] friendly service and seated within minutes.  We were quickly seated but then after 10 minutes, several employees started to look concerned and started asking if our drink order had been taken yet (it hadn't), and going off to find other employees to rectify it.  Finally someone offered to take our drink order at the outside patio (a water and an unsweet tea) and said that if she had to, she could take our food order.  I was introducing my Mother to the \"deliciousness of the wings from Lebowskis\" as I had learned to love them which meant I needed a 25 wing order to fulfill the duty of my eating them along with my Mom (we ended up eating 7/7 of a 10/10 order).  She loved them but the fact that a wing restaurant can't cater to special wing orders (such as the 25 wings for $20 for a middle aged lady and her son) speaks volumes about the mindset of the owner.  i started this review as five-stars, briefly dropped it to four, and then got angry about how the establishment doesn't exercise discretion amongst its patrons (aka a Mom and Son couple is different than 12 frat 'bros' when ordering wings)...  Discretion is key and it lacks here, but the food is delicious..."}
{"text":"So, on most days I have to fight myself not to drive here and get wings. Great, now I want wings. *forces self to stay in chair and write review*  This is such a great neighborhood bar. Completely laid back. And if you're from Buffalo, you'll fall even more love with this place. You'll find things like Beef on 'Weck and chicken finger subs on the menu. They're a Bills backer bar.   Lebowski's has a ton of daily specials. Lunch, dinner, drinks. They even do a twice a day happy hour. On Wednesdays, wings are half price all day. My favorites are the gold rush and good ole buffalo style sauces. Ton of burger and chicken sandwich options on the menu. I love that there's a slider nation section with a combi-nation: six wings, one slider, and fries for $11.95. The garlic fries are delicious.   Other odds and ends: Trivia on Tuesday nights. The patio is dog-friendly. House White Russians are four bucks every day. The parking lot is a little awkward and can get crowded.  So, who wants to go eat wings now?"}
{"text":"\"You're not wrong Walter...\"  Tonight was my group's second trip to Lebowski's for trivia and we had sort of a... weird night.  I can't really be angry.  The buffalo wings were excellent.  The staff was friendly.  But man...  Trivia starts at 8, we get there at 7:45.  There were several groups milling around and the hostess looked a little frazzled.  She took our name, maybe a few groups ahead of us.  As we're waiting more and more people are showing up and being seated from a reservation book.  Did you know Lebowski's took reservations?  I wouldn't even think about it but I can accept that trivia is popular.  One of the reasons I was interested in the place is my brother has been to trivia dozens of times - never heard of the reservation book.  Well we waited, and waited.  We were offered a table outside but my friends turned it down.  The thing that irritated me, and I'm sure this is something you fixate on when you're waiting to be seated but - For nearly an hour a group sat with their check on their table.  As near as I could tell, and I was staring them down like a complete weirdo, no staff came by to hurry them along.  They weren't playing trivia and it was a packed house.  We were standing up playing.  We finally snagged a table, not the one I was obsessing over.  Those folks stayed over an hour after having finished.  We decided to go ahead and leave after eating.  We missed getting our question sheet for the second round amidst the hubbub of getting seated.  So a lot of this isn't Lebowski's fault but I really felt like whoever is behind restaurant karma wasn't on our side tonight.  If I was with someone lingering that bad at the table I'd just leave them there."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The food is always good and they had a load of options. My favorite things on the menu were the Tuscan Turkey Burger and the Spot Tots. The Tuscan style is no longer on the menu but you are still able to order it. There were no complaints from me but my friends said they would pass on the Mac and Cheese next time."}
{"text":"Never knew I would like a sandwich so much! Food Tasted super fresh and the place has a simple and elegant ambience!"}
{"text":"I have yet to have bad food here...Beef on Kimmewick, Mac and Cheese, Garlic Fries (but I like Mac and Cheese better).    They serve Becks and have trivia.  Pretty easy parking and great staff.  Nick is great.  Decent beer collection.  Want to catch trivia.    This is the kind of place that if I lived closer to it...I would be like Norm form Cheers...they would all know my name."}
{"text":"Probably the best buffalo bar in Charlotte...didn't know there were so many. Had the Lebowski burger and the food, like buffalo sport teams, was mediocre."}
{"text":"Went to Lebowski's for the first time last Friday. We were on the hunt for some good wings. We arrived a bit before the dinner rush (just after happy hour ended) and did not wait long for a table. The atmosphere inside Lebowski's reminds of my favorite neighborhood bar from Ft. Lauderdale; it looked to be filled with local regulars enjoying the end of their week.   Ordered the medium buffalo wings for an appetizer and they were the best part of our meal! I would like to try some of their other flavors next time. I ordered the two slider meal with the buffalo chicken sandwich and the cheeseburger, garlic fries as my side. The fries were amazing.   The sliders were much smaller than the waitress made them out to be (I had asked her how big they were). Normally a slider meal will come with 3-4 sliders at that size, but this one only had 2. For $3 more I could have ordered another slider, but still $10 for 3 small mediocre-tasting sliders is a bit much.   Our waitress was attentive and our beers were refilled in a timely manner. I would go back to try other wing flavors and for the fries."}
{"text":"Lebowski's is definitely a neighborhood place to grab a bite to eat and wash it down with alcohol. Thankfully it's walking distance from the hospital so my brother and I made our way there several times, one for lunch and another for dinner. It's one of his favorite places in the area.   Parking can be a challenge since the lot is small and parking hard to come by in the immediate vicinity on East Blvd. it also gets very crowded here. We opted to sit in the outdoor patio out front even when it was a little chilly since the inside is pretty cramped. Even though they have heat lamps outside we were told they can't use them since it's some sort of fire hazard. No biggie, I'm from Chicago so it didn't bother me. I preferred sitting outside since the inside smells a little like a wet damp cloth.  Both the hostess and staff are so friendly. Our server was kind enough to card us, which happened to be a few days after my birthday, bless her soul. Obviously I had to have a White Russian from their drink menu dedicated just to The Dude's quintessential drink. Both The Stranger and The Lebowski Caucasian hit the spot.  We tried the Trio Dip Platter which came with Spinach-Artichoke, Pimento Cheese, and Hummus, along with a good portion of pita points, crostini, and tortilla chips for dipping. It's a great way to start a meal and perfect for sharing since it can appeal to a variety of tastes. For entrees I had The Fredonia with the 'Weck (Kosher salt and caraway seeds) added to the grilled panini bread. It was so good. The roast beef and provolone with the accompany au ju was au so juicy. The 'Weck elevated it to the next level. Just the taste and crunch from the seeds added to the flavor land. texture profile. Also upped my side order to the garlic fries. They were good but not as crispy as I'd hoped. Brother had the Maude's Meatloaf which he's had before and said was great.  We went back for wing night during the week. The Garlic-Parm wings were great. The garlic fries were better this time around. Looking forward to the next visit when I'm back in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We go here a lot with our office staff. The fish is so yummy! The service is usually slow but they are super nice and accommodating. Parking is a little weird but since we normally walk here, it isn't that big of a deal for me."}
{"text":"My first time here and I heard the wings were amazing so I tried them along with a burger. Shockingly I finished both! Food was amazing and the service was great. I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Lots of beer selections and great bar food. Wings are crispy, good char, and tasty sauces. Also comes with good portion of celery, which is rare. And beef on a weck is stacked and my #1 get on the menu (with au jus)!"}
{"text":"Great late-night option, or dinner!  Always our go to when we can't decide on dinner and it's 8 pm... the staff are friendly and attentive and all of the food is good.  Highly recommend the sweet potato tots as your side!  And they run great daily specials at the bar.   Also a great place to sit and watch a game!"}
{"text":"We used to be big fans of Township Grill where the family started in Charlotte but don't get to East Blvd all that often. We happened to be in the area last night and stopped in and are we glad that we did.  There was plenty of parking and easy access from the road.  We were greeted warmly like they really cared that we were there. The atmosphere was just right for a neighborhood bar and grill.   Our server was super.  Just the right mix of efficient professionalism and friendly helpfulness.  She helped us select a couple of our favorites from the old days; The beef on a weck and the fish fry.  They are every bit as good as they ever were and maybe even a bit better. The portions were perfect for an evening meal.  The price was very reasonable. It took us a while to find our old friends but we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Just not a good experience. It's too bad. This is our second time trying this restaurant. With so much competition the food and service really needs to improve"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in Charlotte, almost a dive bar but not really... The food here is great, and the service top notch. Good craft beer specials from the local breweries.  Lebowski's  has great wings and sandwiches alike. We are really fond of the Dilworth area.  Be sure to stop by."}
{"text":"Great Food! Period! The White Fish amazing and always fresh! Friends who have eaten here all have had a great experience."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great. Husband had the bacon cheeseburger and it was cooked perfectly. Salad was fresh and green. My cheeseburger sliders were a bit dry, no extras (lettuce, tomato, onion, sauce, etc) - forgettable. Sweet potato tator tots were cooked correctly, but not much additional flavor to them to make them stand out. Service was excellent, hostess efficient and friendly. Restaurant was cold, so a bit uncomfortable. To be fair, the hostess tried to seat us at a high top table further in due to the cold, but we didn't want to \"be on display\" and asked to sit at a regular table. Pictures of other dishes on Yelp look good, so maybe I picked the outlier."}
{"text":"We've gone here twice, but each time it's so hot in there it's just too miserable to stay. How about getting that air conditioning fixed???"}
{"text":"Lebowski's is ok, but not great.  The outdoor patio is nice and service was really good, but the food was uninspired.  The chili nachos had very little cheese - and it was that runny cheese-whizzy stuff.  The chili was also on the sweet side, and not to my taste. The burger was decently priced but overcooked.  The pulled pork dinner was a small pile of shredded pork on top of a huge pile of mac 'n cheese.  Unfortunately, the mac 'n cheese was also made with that runny cheese.  Portion sizes were decent, but when the food is not that great, what's the point?"}
{"text":"I really like this place! I don't know why I don't stop by more. First time I headed over my friend and I sat on the patio and sipped on beers. Not a huge beer menu but think I've been spoiled by the places with 40 or so beers on tap. You can always take your chances with a 'mystery beer', which is really just whatever random beer they pull and charge you $2 for haha.   Last time I headed over was for lunch. Parking in the back can get tight and can be a challenge getting out as well so be prepared. But anywho, ended up getting a half-priced deal so headed over to meet a friend. I order the buffalo chicken wrap and my friend opted for the French dip and we both had side salads - it was all very delicious! Gotta say, I was happily surprised... I underestimated the quality of food at Lebowski's. And the service was prompt and friendly as well. A great spot in Dilworth to chill out at night and a speedy place to go for lunch as well - props to Lebowski's."}
{"text":"First time visit was yesterday for lunch. It was relaxing and tasty. I had the fried haddock and garlic fries (junior portion - generous serving) and it was incredibly tasty. Some if the best best fried fish I've eaten!  The garlic fries were divine. Substituted cinnamon apples for the slaw. Also tasty. My mother had the Angus beef burger and declared it delicious and perfectly cooked. Wait staff attentive and knowledgeable. Will return!"}
{"text":"I am a wing fan of the most particular kind and these wings did not disappoint! Best wings ever! I had the house special sandwich, their version of the French Dip. The bread was to die for, horsey sauce was over the top! I got the side salad and I am telling you it was fresh, crisp and the freshly made dressing was perfect.  Patio seating, bar or table seating."}
{"text":"This tiny little eatery makes up in taste what it lacks in service. The food is worth the trip folks. I got a trio platter and tried the haddock, beef on weck, and the wings. The beef on weck is the clear winner here. What awesome flavor! They have great outdoor seating and allow dogs on the patio. The menu looks great, so I'm sure to be back to try something else (or just eat another beef on weck)."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for lunch. Lebowski burger and Wooden Robot Overachiever pale ale are an awesome combination."}
{"text":"The food here is good. The service is quick.  The prices are reasonable. I like the environment because it is just comfortable and casual. I will definitely be back for a second try!"}
{"text":"This place is a typical neighborhood pub however they have good food fully stocked bar and beers on tap. Usually a good crowd on weeknights and on weekends. They also have bar games. It's in a good location in Dilworth. This is not my favorite spot however good to revisit every now and then."}
{"text":"The E-Street pita is very tasty. The spot tots and the cinnamon butter is awesome. They are just very stingy with how many they give you compared to other restaurants . It was freezing and would not seat us outside . The fans were blowing my hair while I ate. Staff is friendly ."}
{"text":"This has kind of become my boyfriend's and my after church stop! This unassuming place is not only delicious, but has something for everyone on the menu. Their haddock fish fry is out of this world, and it's the same fish they throw on their soft tacos, which is usually my go-to.   The beef on weck is also a popular choice and is served with a generous amount of fries (or any side for that matter). They also have \"spot tots\" which are sweet potato tater tots! Such an amazing taste!   I would highly recommend checking out this dude loving, buffalo supporting bar/restaurant in Dilworth if you have the chance, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great Neighborhood spot!  The chili is my favorite along with the great sandwiches.  Also, the Time magazine cover mirror in the ladies bathroom is hilarious.  The Dude Abides!"}
{"text":"Pros: Great wings Great beef on Weck (best in Charlotte)  Cons: Bad parking The restaurant really needs to be updated, but I guess that's some of its charm.  Awful service. We waited almost 45 minutes before we got our sandwiches. They charge extra for au jus, which is just weird to me!  For Buffalo food, this place is great."}
{"text":"Awesome!  This is a great neighborhood restaurant/bar with patio seating and good service.  I typically order something new at places so I can try everything, but it is incredibly difficult to not order the wings, or at least the beef on weck.  I love the hot or jerkiyaki wings.  I try not to say that somewhere has the best anything, unless it is true... Lebowski's has the best wings you will get anywhere.  The owner, Kirk, is from Buffalo and he knows his stuff.  They cook the wings the right way, using fresh chicken wings and he puts them on the flat top to help crisp them up.  You won't be able to eat BW3 or any other crap wings ever again without comparing them to Lebowski's."}
{"text":"This place has arguably the best casual/bar food in the city. The wings are absolutely fantastic (medium buffalo ordered extra-crispy are our favorite), and the other items are always consistent. The beef on weck (with \"horsey\" sauce) and haddock fish fry will not disappoint. Try the signature Lebowski Caucasian White Russian from the bar as a nice change-up from your typical bar drinks."}
{"text":"With a Buffalo theme, you know the wings should be good. The wings are as good as advertised, game days are fun, kids have fun options and the staff is always friendly and helpful.   This is one of a our favorite places to take the whole family, and even the dogs can hang out on the outdoor patio.   If you are in the mood for beer, wings and a Beef on 'Weck, you need to take your crew here..."}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant! It's one of my regular spots now. All the servers I've had so far have all been GREAT!! They have some kind of fish dinner that is to-die-for. Big portions for the price you pay. I usually can't finish all of my fish, but I can't avoid stuffing myself from trying! I also usually get the \"Bunny Toes\" drink. It's like a mint-chocolate White Russian (has Bailey's mint chocolate in it). It's delicious!!"}
{"text":"I wanted wings, that's the main reason we came here and it did not disappoint. They where perfectly cooked and the flavors where on point! Garlic parm & buffalo where our favorite. The hostess and waitress where very nice and attentive. The garlic fries where also great. Can't wait to come back and eat more wings!"}
{"text":"I found this place while searching for a good wing place. I must say I'm impressed! The wings were really good they were hot just like I like them! The waitress was extremely nice and even gave me a free brew on the house. For 10 wings and fries came up to $13.95 and that's not bad. I don't stay far from the dilworth area and have seen this place on Yelp but never tried it. I'm so glad I did! I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu. Thanks Lebowskis for making my day after a long hard work day!"}
{"text":"Tuesday night is always hopping with trivia. If you want to bring a group for trivia you may want to call ahead so you can make sure to get a table big enough. First place is $30 and the winners of each round get 4 beers.  My favorite is the chicken tenders tossed in \"stingers\" sauce but pretty much anything on the eclectic menu is great. Haven't found anything that I've been remotely disappointed in after coming almost once a week for a year."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch with my Shmoopy. Meatloaf:Outstanding Beef weck:Yummo Return soon: Yea Dude"}
{"text":"I wasn't really sure about this place at first.  With a Big Lebowski theme, you would expect more of a west coast vibe.  This place is all New York east coast atmosphere.  I had the Beef on weck, and it just didn't hit the spot.  The true star of my meal was the garlic fries.  I rarely eat fries anymore, but I'm pretty sure I get these guys every time I come here.  My hetero life mate had the Buffalo Trifecta.  The blackened wings were really bland.  We each tried one, and then never touched them again.  The fish was amazing.  That's what I'll be ordering next time I'm there."}
{"text":"Where do I start...friendly service from the moment the phone is answered and to me that's important. The food, OMGoodness the food, is beyond AMAZING! I can honestly say it's the best food I've had in a very long time (and my family orders takeout a lot) each time better than the time before. For anyone who loves pulled pork, their Memphis Style sandwich is nothing short of spectacular!!! Tender and juicy on grilled sourdough bread with pepper jack cheese, I didn't even know I liked pepper jack cheese, it's easily become my new favorite meal. Sandwiches come with chips but I spend the extra 99¢ for the cinnamon apples (the best I've ever tasted). My son loves the Lebowski burger which comes with roast beef and queso, quite the combination and not one I ever would've thought of but delicious! Definitely a place worth trying, repeatedly"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try a different sports bar in town, mainly because it  was Game 4 of the NBA Finals... we chose this bar because we'd heard people talk about it and we passed it frequently. Parking was \"interesting\", but we figured it out and the wait time for a Friday evening was pretty good (about 15 minutes). But from that point on, it was a DISASTER; we waited close to 20 minutes before anyone came by to even give us water or utensils (while every table around us was clearly being served appropriately). Once someone actually took our drink order, the wait staff FINALLY came over and attempted to take our order; the server was very fake and aloof and came off with the \"why are you here?\" attitude (we did notice that we were the ONLY people of color in the bar at the time) To give some credit, the food order did arrive quickly and the food itself was fair overall, but the service and the experience was the worst I've experienced in quite some time and we will don't be going back ever again!! I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE OF COLOR... the disrespect was blatant and unapologetic..."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday and had their dinner special (Crispy Haddock Filet and homemade Crab Cake with Chili-Lime Aioli, fries and coleslaw) with a Stranger White Russian... Both were great choices, but the crab cake on the special could use a little something... Not sure what, but it didn't really blow me away...  The White Russian was insane... I haven't stopped thinking about it since... lol I'm kind of mad it took me this long to go here since I'm actually from Charlotte! lol"}
{"text":"Best around for a friendly low key night out.  Great service, very solid bar food, and reasonable prices.  Great wings, fried fish and nachos.   Decent selection and a late night menu after 10pm."}
{"text":"Not just excellent bar food. Sure, the wings, nachos, fries, fried pickles are ALL excellent, but we go here just as much for the SUPERB fried haddock or the DELICIOUS, FRESH, & ORIGINAL SALADS!  Beyond that Lebowski's is family run & EVERY employee treats you like family.  Great weekly lunch and dinner specials, one of my favs is Wednesdays when wings are 1/2 off and bartenders pick of beer is just $3 (you give them yvour preference and they pick something in that wheelhouse ... FUN!).  You also can't beat a place that celebrates the classic The Big Lewbowski! Top it off, the white Russians and specialty white Russians are AWESOME (bunny toes and nutty Walter being my 2 favs)  Lebowski's gets my highest recommendation for the WHOLE PACKAGE ... the menu, the drinks, the atmosphere, the staff, and the attentiveness to bar fare done excellent!"}
{"text":"Everything you could imagine bar wise in the menu food-wise especially a solid atmosphere without a hassle. Remember, it's called lebowskis named after a movie who featured a stoner who took it easy and drank white Russians. If you're in a hurry or want fast food, go someplace else. Excellent mid to high end bar food and solid meals. No steaks or anything but great in a pinch when you want specials and drinks with friendly service. An old lady is bitching about her family for the last half hour at the bar right now which drives me nuts but this place takes all types. Roll the dice, order a house Caucasian after you smoke a bowl in the parking lot, and get some wings or a roast beef sandwich with a free side bc of the help app.  You're welcome.  I can listen to this retard crab about her shitty family to some guy with a \"fupa\" because this place is so cool."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Lebowski's on a Saturday.  I got there around 11:30 am and the place wasn't too full yet.  I had this on my list to try and the recent burger battle in the Observer had gotten me in the mood to try out some of the best burger spots.  I ordered a cheeseburger with pepper jack and the standard setup.  It comes with chips, but I opted for the fries for an extra $0.99.  The had a nice list of beers and I went with and OMB Copper.  My food & beer made it out pretty quickly.  When the server brought my food he also brought ketchup & mustard.  The ketchup was cold from the fridge, which I like, but that is unusual.  So a plus for cold ketchup.  The burger was done medium and was juicy.  The lettuce and tomato were fresh.  The fries were crisp on the outside and creamy soft on the inside.  Overall a very nice burger an fries.  The best in Charlotte?  This was my first stop at a burger place so that remains to be seen.  The servers did a good job of helping each other.  Which was good because my server was \"getting her butt kicked,\" as she put it when she checked back on me once.  I had to wait quite a while for my check and for her to run my credit card.   It was busy, but no where near being swamped.  That was unfortunate and I hope she was having a bad day.  The food was a 4 the service was a 2 so I have to give them 3 stars.  I will try Lebowski's again just to see if that was a bad day or par for the course."}
{"text":"Found this spot on yelp, Lebowski's didn't disappoint. Everything was good and fresh. The service was friendly and fast. I would recommend and definitely return."}
{"text":"We were at Lebowski's a few months back for a few beers and we were impressed with the sincerity of the bartender, so now we live in Charlotte and we had to go back for food and we were not disappointed. Wings with sweet honey chili sauce were nice and crispy, needed no Blue Cheese or any other sauce. PLT sandwich (Pimiento, Lettuce and Cheese) was great. I had the burger with Pimiento and onion rings, it was phenomenal, as were the garlic fries.  My only concern was that it seemed that the bathroom walls and ads behind the urinal hadn't been cleaned in a long time, they looked very dusty. Overall, I will be back often!"}
{"text":"Went to Lebowskis last week for dinner. The food and service were outstanding! I had the Haddock fish fry which was crisp on the outside and seasoned just right. My companion had the roast beef panini which he liked very much and my other friend's burger was cooked to perfection. Great beer selection. We didn't try the White Russians but they sounded delicious.  We lingered after dinner to talk and made to feel right at home. A real Buffalo treat in the heart of the south!"}
{"text":"I would have to say dining here was a mediocre food and service experience.  Staff seemed friendly enough but they often disappeared for extended periods of time. We ordered hot buffalo wings for an appetizer which would be the best part of the dining experience at Lebowski's. Not overly spicy to where you cannot eat them but delivered a little kick with nice flavor.   Following the wings I ordered Durango Chicken. This dish was cooked well but left something to be desired in flavor. My other half ordered the Boss Grilled Turkey Club with side of mac and cheese. He states it was a mediocre sandwich, nothing that impressed him. Mac and cheese not as cheesy or creamy as one would want, but flavor is \"alright\".  Tables are exceptionally close to each other, so if you want any privacy or are trying to choose a place that welcomes long stays and good conversation, look on to other places to better fit your needs.   If you need a little positive note to end the review on, Lebowski's has a nice beer selection and they come out ice cold which is always appreciated."}
{"text":"Being from Buffalo, this felt like home.   When I go to the grocery store and ask for au jous at the deli counter they think I am nuts, but here they make that beef on weck.    They also have a real fish fry!     All nostalgia aside, food is good, but it is also kind of a typical bar.    Good place to have some fun and a casual meal."}
{"text":"Me: Wellp. It's getting too late to run to the store to get stuff to grill, want to go out? Lady: Everything is going to have a long wait by now! 7:30 on a Saturday?  Me: Can we at least try something? I have a place bookmarked. Casual place, shouldn't be any problem getting in.   And we didn't. And it was a really good Saturday night dinner. This was our first time here and sure as hell won't be our last. First of all, I can't commend the staff enough. The friendliest bunch of people will do anything to give you recommendations or suggestions. The food was great as well! I got their pimento burger with garlic fries (which I really really recommend), and the lady ordered the Mission Bay Salad (with the added haddock and dressing), not to be missed. I can't wait to go back and try out more of their offerings, especially their wings and Beef on 'Weck. (I know, I should've ordered this the first time I came, but that's what second chances are for, right?)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an upscale dining experience, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a comfortable neighborhood bar that focuses on the food and a unique atmosphere go here.  I've been searching for great wings in Charlotte for years and I've found them.  They do them the buffalo way and they are delicious.  The beers were cold and the staff was friendly.  The owner and his daughter were behind the bar and were very friendly and conversational, if you like that kind of thing.  I got french fries with my wings and they were on point.  The blue cheese was over seasoned and not enough crumbles for my liking, but still enjoyable.  I would give this place 5 stars, but the only thing they're lacking is their TV situation for sports.  I scratched my head when I heard that it's the biggest Bills bar in the Carolinas when I saw they only have two small out dated TV's behind the bar.  Nevertheless, next time I have friends in town and we're in the mood for wings, I'm taking them to Lebowski's  The owner told me the meatloaf is worth coming back as well so I'll try that next time."}
{"text":"I don't know why I wasn't expecting much considering the raving reviews, but this place really made an impression on me! It's definitely a cozy neighborhood bar type of place. The waitress was very friendly as was everyone on the staff.   We started with the wings for an appetizer and our waitress suggested getting the \"gold rush\" flavor. It was like a mustard based sauce with some heat to it. They were delicious! I would recommend the gold rush wings to anyone. For dinner I had the meatloaf and it was very tasty. The gravy had lots of great flavor and it was a ton of food. My only negative was that the veggies were too oily. My lips were coated in oil. Other than that very good. My husband got the beef of weck sandwich and it was ok. I didn't prefer it because the bun was covered in rye, but the beef was ok. Overall, I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We had originally planned to go the the Cheesecake Factory, we waited about two hours and still didn't get a table then; we went to bad daddy's burger bar. It was crazy they told us It would be about an hour so we decided to try this place. This was by far one of my favorite restaurants of all time! I can say the blew bad daddy's out of the water!!!! I've been a vegetarian for almost 16 years and really the only thing I can find out to eat is veggie burgers. You could substitute about any chicken or meat on the menu for hot Buffalo Cauliflower Bites. I had a buffalo cauliflower wrap and It was my favorite food of all time! My husband loved the wrap and he's a meat eater. Our waitress was so nice and It was a very relaxing spot. We ate outside and It was quiet and we could actually talk and enjoy ourselves! I can't wait to go back. We live about an hour away but It worth the drive and the prices are great too. I am so glad we found this place."}
{"text":"My go-to late night spot! They have great drink specials (try the White Russians!!) consistently good food, and the atmosphere is relaxed and friendly. The late night menu has options for meat eaters and vegetarians, so I find something for every mood. Plus, it's a local business and the waitstaff are efficient and always ready with a recommendation! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yay Friday!  After a long haul, my man and I wanted to celebrate the best night of the week.  We put our name in for a table and approached the bar.  The bartender immediately acknowledged, even though she was mixing a drink.  Talk about multitasking! We were seated fairly soon after getting drinks from the bar.  I ordered the veggie burger with pimento cheese and onion rings, no bun.  With fries.  Very pleased with the delightful tastes.  My honey  got haddock sliders and Mac and cheese.  He also liked his meal, although he prefers his Mac to have baked on cheese instead of mere creaminess. The really outstanding feature of Lebowski's is the staff.  Nobody acts \"too cool\" like some of the young, hipster hosts and servers at other establishments.  Everyone projected a sincere attitude of happy and upbeat.  They were on it with their service. TGIF indeed!"}
{"text":"Once again Yelp comes through!!!  Lebowski's is GREAT. Small and cozy with good games on the TV. The wigs are where it's at. I had the Jerkiyaki and there were perfect. The Blue Cheese is on point and the Yuengling was nice and cold. I would have given 5 stars but the Yuengling wasn't on top!!! 10 wings and a beer for $16.00."}
{"text":"If you love roast beef, you must have the beef on weck! What a great sandwich. I thought about giving this place 3 stars but I thought harder and I feel it deserves 4. The wings are probably my favorite in the Charlotte area, in fact, this is the only place that I crave wings from.  The beef on weck was amazing.  I wanted to try something different so I had the chicken sandwich, jerk style because the waitress confirmed that it was really good and my husband had the Fredonia Dip.  I did not enjoy the \"jerk style\" on my chicken sandwich, although the chicken was fine.  My husband said his Fredonia dip was good but not as good as the Beef of Weck.  Overall, the food is great.  Oh...did I mention the garlic fries?  Those are yummy too!  A great place to hang out for lunch, everyone is friendly and it has a great patio with a TV to watch football!  I think I might stop by for a beer one night too since it has a cute little bar - but be warned, it's not big and doesn't have a lot of stools."}
{"text":"It is pretty hard not to be a fan of Lebowski's.  I mean it really is the perfect \"neighborhood\" grill.  Great atmosphere, low key, lots of options, affordable prices, great location, etc.  You really can't go wrong.  We had a party of 10 on a Saturday night and we were seated quickly, served promptly and efficiently.  We started with the fried pickles which were okay but a little too salty.  The ranch dressing was yummy though.  Everyone got something different...some burgers, some wraps, some salad, some wings, etc.  I tried the veggie burger in a pita wrap and it was great!  The sweet potato tots with honey butter dip were amazing.  It is pretty hard to go wrong with that but they really were excellent.  We weren't offered dessert so I have no idea if they have a good dessert menu but everything else hit the spot.  The pimento cheeseburger was a crowd favorite as well.  Truly there is something for everyone, healthy or greasy.  Great spot to catch a game, have a low key date night or to bring a group of friends.  I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Great selection of sandwiches we haven't had since moving down from Buffalo, NY. Waitress was great and made it a great experience"}
{"text":"Dudes, Without a doubt, this is one of the best bar and grills I have ever been to. I should say I came here while in town for a conference and because I am a fan of the movie. However, it could have been a niche/theme restaurant only if it weren't for the great food and excellent service. The wings are great-I like them extra hot and these are not but they taste great. Sliders were wonderful. Beer selection proud and reasonably priced. A variety of White Russian specials (Caucasians) that were tasty too. The place is decorated with some original TBL themes art-some of which they were willing to sell. Amy was our server on both visits and she was one of the best servers I've ever had in a restaurant and went above and beyond for us. I would go back as a fan of the Dude if it wasn't good-but if they completely dropped the theme i would still be back any chance I got for the food and service. I just wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"I am embarrassed to admit I have never been to Lebwoski's...but, that is about to change. Last night we decided to check it out for dinner. After walking in all I could think about was the seafood/sushi restaurant that was in this same locations YEARS ago. So, with that in mind I was surprised how dark the restaurant was, and a lot more casual.  There are several TVs, a bar along the back wall and several tables throughout. But, the highlight is the outdoor patio. Have never been and heard great things about so many menu options we ordered a varity of items, including, wings, haddock, beef on weck, mashed potatoes and gravy and salad.  First off, the salad was simple, but very fresh. As for the wings, the best I have had in Charlotte. We got medium heat and it was perfect for my liking.  The haddock, OMG, loved it!  Great white fish with a light batter and a flavorful tartar sauce. My least favor item was the weck on beef. That may be because I am not a huge beef eater, but I thought it was just okay. And, they forgot our au jus so that may have helped. Overall great service, food and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The place could use an update, but I guess it has character. Best margaritas ever, and you can't beat their BBQ platter, or burgers. I've honestly never had a bad experience here. Staff is super friendly and I like that they take the time to talk to you. Never feel rushed, and patio seating is perfect for summer time weather, because it's in the shade!"}
{"text":"It is what it looks like - a great place of beer, (excellent) bar/pub food, and hanging with fun, neighborhood people. I have been a number of times at all times of day - but mostly for lunch or evening during the week. Always excellent fare - especially the wings and burgers. I loved sitting outside recently - something I usually don't get to do. It is not pretentious and just does the simple things very well. Always kind and courteous and willing to give some great suggestions for drinks. Go and give it a try."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places in Charlotte. Been here about 10 times.  My wife loves the Weck - and has never been disappointed. She loves it. I've gotten the burgers and fish and they've always been good. We always pay a little extra to get the fries (worth it). The service has always been top notch.  Nice neighborhood feel with older and younger couples; families and folks just hanging out.  The parking lot is small and a little tricky. But that's the worst thing I can say. Everyone should try Lebowski's at least once."}
{"text":"I've never written a review before but I had to here. Although the entrees were good, the fried pickles were sooo salty!! It was like eating a salt lick. I wouldn't have been upset but after mentioning it to the waiter, who was nice but not very attentive, said he would let the kitchen know but never refunded me!! We didn't even eat them so it was obvious!!! Not to mention, they charge you for sides, the price on the sandwiches are expensive, then add an additional charge for a side. They ask you what side you want without mentioning it will be extra, you would assume the sandwiches would come with a side since the prices are high. I also waited 15 minutes to ask for ketchup so I got some myself from another table. I feel the owners are greedy. Not coming back"}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere and very nice staff but neither the wings nor the Beef on Weck were anywhere near the true Buffalo standards."}
{"text":"Good local spot for a quick bite & drinks. Solid good food. This place was semi-forgotten by me until recently, once on a \"snow\" day and another time on a late Sunday night. For the most part, you can always count on this place being open and serving food.   I'm a fan of the $4 house white russian - it's like dessert first, dinner later. For meal, both times I had their sliders combo - good meatloaf (next time I will ask for more gravy), great fried fish & okay chicken parm. Only downside is their side - only chips comes with sandwiches. Or you can pay extra for other side options (even fries). BUT - when you check in on Yelp, it has a Yelp offer for side order. They let me have the chili mac and it was delish and HUGE. I know everyone loves their wings here - they are ok in my book, small in size, pretty hot for mild buffalo, and generally speaking I think their other food offerings are more satisfying.  Limited parking behind the building. so good luck.  Way to go Lebowski for keeping up the good work all these years!"}
{"text":"Returning to this classic after entirely too long, I met a friend here for lunch today. Wow, it hasn't changed much since then. Perhaps a few more \"Big Lebowsky\" trinkets from the movie (I liked the Lego \"picture\") and updated furniture.  I went right to the \"The Lebowski Burger\" which comes topped with sliced roast beef and queso on a 'Weck roll'. Swapping out the chips for fries, it was excellent. Lots of meat, of course. Drippy cheese. Fries were \"steak fries\" variety and seasoned. Tasty and firm for scooping ketchup.  Good selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I like to sample different things on the menu if it's my first time going to a place. The ambiance is cool! I took the little ones with me as well so it is definitely kid friendly. I had the large haddock platter and this fish is huge!!! So come hungry. I also ordered the haddock slider, honey butter chicken slider, and 1 buffalo cauliflower taco. Everything was amazing! No complaints! My daughter had the burger sliders and my son had the grill cheese..."}
{"text":"I came to Lebowski's randomly with a friend. Parking (as with most of Dilworth) can be quite a bear. They have a parking lot, but it's really tight. I like that there is a patio, so that is nice to sit outside. Overall, the food was okay. I really enjoyed the sweet potato tater tots. Other than that, I wasn't super impressed with the food. It's a nice place to hang out with a lot of TVs, so good for watching games.  Another big perk was they allowed my dog to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"This place is chill. The service is fast and  courteous. The wings are good. The fried pickles are great. The weck is delicious."}
{"text":"3.5 stars   We stopped by Lebowski's for the first time yesterday for HH. I love the fact that Lebowski's have daily lunch and dinner specials on top of daily drink specials and HH two times a day from 4-6p and 10p-12a. There is also a fabulous Groupon deal right now, get on it! I don't like the fact that the parking lot is kind of a mess, very inconvenient that there isn't a second or larger exit. (Docked half a star.) We parked in the back but luckily were able to back out before running into trouble. There was Bills stuff everywhere! I'd love to watch a game here sometime, I'm sure they would have great specials.   Luckily, we were able to find a couple of bar seats right away as it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be at 5:45p. We ordered a couple of the $4 house White Russians which were $1 off...it was really strong at first but it tasted great..very comparable to melted Thrifty's ice cream..yum, my childhood. But beware, there is a TON of half and half in them, not diet friendly at all. We also ordered the spinach artichoke dip and tacos (1 chicken and 1 haddock). I enjoyed the spinach artichoke dip, tasted better than the dip offered at Crave. It also came with fresh tortilla chips and mini garlic toasts. I didn't like the tacos as much, there was way too much cabbage slaw that had a overpowering horseradishy/vinegary after taste. (Docked a star)The salsa was also on the sweet side but I didn't mind, I thought it went well with the fish. The chicken was well seasoned and juicy, I'd order this again and tell the server to have the kitchen go easy on the slaw.   Don't worry, I'm sure this rating will go up after I get my hands on the wings or battered fish plate. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"Great bar food, has it's own parking (although tight), which is a plus in this neighborhood.  My son had the Burger (Medium!) 4 Stars and Garlic fries (rockin!) 8 Stars :)  I had the Beef on Weck...which was probably the best I've had outside of Buffalo. 5 Stars  Wings were cooked great...not a big fan of their Hot Sauce...but could be a personal preference....would rate them 3.5 stars  Look forward to going back when I get to have a beer or two"}
{"text":"Cool restaurant, especially if you are from western NY or a Big Lebowski fan. Good sandwiches and appetizer selection. Tues is trivia and 1/2 price specialty drinks."}
{"text":"I have to say I love gong to Lebowski's.  In fact I think I would love going to any place that was written up as having one of the best sandwiches in Charlotte, but this one really comes through.  A nice place, very inviting, small bar where I think everyone really could know your name.  but on to more urgent matters.  There are three words I am thrilled to hear upon walking into this place, besides \"pick a table\" and that is \"BEEF ON WECK.\"  It in itself is worth the trip.  Roast beef sliced thin and piled high on a weck roll, fresh made roll with course salt and rye seeds, it is out of this world.  Before going to Buffalo way too often in the past I had never heard of Beef on Weck and once my wife and I decided to move to Charlotte I thought I would never hear of it again.  But I have to say Lebowski's offered it, I loved it and the rest is history.  I'll be back many times I'm sure and I would say everyone needs to try it at least once."}
{"text":"Been here a few times since moving to charlotte. Great food and service. Beer list is perfect for the restaurant. Very easy and layed back. The Beef on weck is a great choice. Wings also a good choice. Trivia on certin nights."}
{"text":"I came here for the sweet potato tots. Good wings and Meatloaf too! Nice place to hang out and good size parking lot for this location!"}
{"text":"I was a little let down based on the great reviews I had read before going. I had the Fredonia dip since the regular Weck sounded kinda plain. I thought it was a decent sandwich but definitely nothing special. My husband had The Boss sandwich and was totally not impressed. Also, the people who were seated next to us after we had been there for 20 minutes got their food 5 minutes before us. We waited a long time for mediocre food. Meh."}
{"text":"Delicious meal at Lebowski's tonight! We had the fish fry and the beef on weck. Fish fry, great as usual. First time for the famous Beef on weck and not disappointed. Beef, bun, and horsey sauce were sublime. Good review for side house salad, blue cheese dressing, service, and tartar sauce ."}
{"text":"Needed a quick meal before going to nursing school clinical's and boy did we get a delicious one!    I had the Beef on Weck.  Tender roast beef, piled high on a bun that's covered in salt, spices, and herbs.  It comes with a very rich flavorful au jus that you can't stop dipping into.  My side item was the Mac and Cheese with Pecan Bacon...absolutely scrumptious.  Like I said we were in a hurry and had to get over to the hospital but they were super fast with our order and everybody's was cooked perfectly.  Will be back and soon!!"}
{"text":"Bland neighborhood joint.  Redeeming value:  some Lebowski art prints on the wall.  Otherwise burgerish joint with poor ambience.   Needs to be either classier or divier to be interesting."}
{"text":"I like Lebowski's.  A casual venue with a neighborhood feel to it.  I have never had a bad meal in the 10+ times I have been there.  Service is pleasant and courteous.  Food is a little better than what you would expect.  What is not to like?  But where is the kielbasa?"}
{"text":"OMG I am embarrassed about my 2011 self that gave this place a 3-star review?!?  Usually now-a-days when I am thinking of what to go eat, Lebowski's is at the top of my list.  I apologize... maybe I gave it a lower star rating so that I would keep this place as my own little secret.  Just as a \"downer\" note, the parking lot in back does tend to get a bit crowded, but if you can walk to this spot, its ideal and you don't have to play bumper cars with the folks out back.  Everything else about this place is great!  Servers are super nice and top-notch.  Even when this place is super busy and they are running around like crazy, they make sure you got everything you need and are enjoying your experience.  Must-do's in this place:  garlic fries, beef on weck sandwhich (if you are into meat), WINGS!, and checking out the cool Lebowski artwork adoring the walls."}
{"text":"I had a Dealsaver coupon that was about to expire at the end of the month and I have lived near this place for several years and it's about time I checked it out.  I sat at the bar and this was one of the best bar experiences I've ever had.  The bartender explained the draft beer selection and their specials on Carolina Craft brews.  Yay!  4 of the locals were represented including Triple C.  :)    Anyway, i had seen the pictures of the food on Yelp and pretty much decided on what I was ordering from those - Fried Pickles and Beef on Weck.  The pickles were advertised as the \"Best on the Blvd\" and that's probably true.  I don't know of any other places on East Blvd that even serve them.  But the slices were big and they were decent.  I like Alexander Michael's better though.   The Beef on Weck was amazing.  The weck itself was the best sandwich bread I have ever tasted.   I ordered the garlic fries with it and they were tasty with a subtle garlic flavor.     As for the venue, it's not very big and I can see this as a great neighborhood bar.  Service really shines here too.  This place is definitely worth coming back to!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the best! If you want the best wings in town, then this is the place for you. My husband and I were in the mood for chicken wings, so we decided to try Lebowski's. The place was crowded, so we sat in the parking lot and placed an order to go. We ordered 25 wings. They only allow you to get 3 type. We ordered the mild original, jerkiaki, and the carolina gold. The wings were cooked to perfection. The carolina gold were my favorite. I encourage any and all to try Lebowski's...you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wings wings wings! Don't come here without trying the wings and I highly recommend the Gold Rush sauce. In addition to the wings we had the Beef on 'Weck, which was great but definitely need the au jus to go with it, and the tacos, which were plenty big for lunch. As a side item, try the Spot Tots which are sweet potato tots with a side of icing. Lastly, you can't go wrong with a wide array of beer. Our waitress was Brandy and she was the poster child for southern hospitality. Thanks Brandy!"}
{"text":"My family had the BBQ wings and the On Weck Roast Beef. I had the pulled pork sandwich. Everyone enjoyed their meal. I didn't like the fries (garlic or plain). We sat outside and the atmosphere was great. Watched some football and relaxed!"}
{"text":"I'm from Buffalo so I know wings and I have to say these are just like I would get back home- they are excellent!  The Beef on Weck is soooo good.  Has a relaxing chilled out atmosphere, never been disappointed here."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday night and was glad to see an almost packed restaurant. There were several TV's playing football games. We were seated and helped right away.  I ordered the Jerk burger, while my husband ordered a burger that had roast beef on top. The jerk burger had a really great taste and I enjoyed the toppings on it. I paid extra for fries instead of chips and noticed right away they were cooked to order. Some places serve fries that even though come out hot you can tell they have been sitting under a warmer. This was not the case at Lebowskis. My husband enjoyed his burger. First time having roast beef on top. He did say he wished there was more roast beef but the burger itself was pretty large. We also had a grilled cheese kids meal and a slider meal on our menu. I really loved how there was an option to mix and match sliders giving the option to try more than one kind. My children seldom finish their food and we always have left overs, this didn't happen dining at Lebowskis. Restaurant was kid friendly especially with the football game going on. The inside is slightly small so the tables are close together but my kids were really well behaved ( thank goodness) so this wasn't necessarily a problem.  Service was great, food was made  quickly and our drinks always remained full. Price was average for a family of four especially since the food was great. Will definitely return when in the area!"}
{"text":"Should probably get your parking situation in order. There are 4 marked spaces behind the building. All others unmarked. Waitress kept coming out yelling at everyone trying to park in the unmarked spaces. Annoyed already and will never come to Lebowskis now."}
