{"text":"Lady taking order was not very friendly. Standoffish. Did not speak much English, but I spoke to her in Spanish which did not improve her friendliness toward me . Very busy menu on wall and no offering of assistance in understanding menu. When asking questions about food items, again she was not very cordial and short in whatever answers she gave.

Ordered tacos of three different meat, they were out of one the selections, birria. Ordered lengua( tongue) &  carne asada(steak). Received order in about 5 minutes.
Tacos were tasty.  Cost was $9.00 which included a medium Pineapple drink. Not the best value. No side dishes include, just the three corn tortilla filled tacos. 
There was salsa bar which was tasty and had several salsas.  

Won't come back. Many other fast food mMexican Restaurants where you feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Shredded chicken tacos are fire . I prefer extra onion with a side of green sauce. Also this is my first time here, I didn't plan to go there I just wanted to pop up cause I was high as hell. Haha Im still high typing this."}
{"text":"On my way to airport to get a flight back to Dallas and I stopped at this place. Shredded beef burrito - awesome!  Very beefy, no skimping, and mammoth for $4.00. I knew It would be good when I unwrapped it and the saw the ultra-fresh  flour tortilla.  Also got a shredded beef taco. Only $1.50 and it was very fresh with freshly fried shell. 

If this place only rates 3 or 4 stars by the locals - they must be getting some great food elsewhere.  I'm goo through the drive thru again next time I'm in town. BTW: the drive thru service was faster than I expected."}
{"text":"I don't know how they pass their health inspection. This place is pretty bad in my opinion. I may be wrong about it but I'll stick with my experiences on this one. Find another Mexican Food Restaurant in the area if you're really craving."}
{"text":"Im a bit of a food freak,well who isn't we all love food. Not much of us can thrown down and make some famous mom's tacos. Speaking only from quick fix dinner nights, I crave moslty for good tacos or burritos. I've been a huge fan of the original fili-b's and I think I always will be. Customers are universal without love in this food, we'll never taste it! Continuing from there...they automatically assumed I was of Mexican descen, which I'm not. I politely said I don't speak Spanish. Sorry. Well I just heard giggles on the Mic and didn't accommodate any customer needs. Do they assume everyone who order to speak and understand Spanish. Well I simply shifted to reverse and I was gone after she blew up on her mic Lol till now I dunno what she said"}
{"text":"I came here looking for the usual- California Burrito and some Jamaica.  I did not get either.  I went through drive-thru and the person taking my order didnt understand my English, so I had to come to the window to ask about their menu.  I could barely understand her English, so I just opted for some quesadilla.  It was okay and I cant compare it to the usual Mexican food I have at Vaqueros on 19th and Southern.  The food was just okay and I was disappointed mostly because I did not have someone who spoke clear English- customer service was okay otherwise."}
{"text":"Best shrimp burro's. If it wasn't in the hood & make me cringe @ the thought of going in at night alone, I maybe would have given it 5 stars. 
The staff is as friendly as any other Mexican spot. The place is kept decently clean. Don't let the outside totally deter you from at least stepping foot in the place. There's a couple TV's playing Mexican music video's to get your mind off of waiting for your order, which is surprisingly fast. Call in orders are necessary when your trying to beat the lunch rush. But any other time, you could be out the door in 10 minutes. 
This place has been here for a while now. There is other La Salsita spots to go to in the valley. Some tweaked their spelling but all in all, best shrimp burro on this side of Van Buren!"}
{"text":"Definitely a late night only spot. With a couple drinks in your system the food is great but not so much sober."}
{"text":"Came by to give them another try since our first visit with their customer service was horrible but we figure new management they might have improved but we were wrong! we waited in the drive thru for 25 minutes for pozole! They didn't even come to check in and say hey it'll be a few more or have any decency instead they were rude and ignored us, I would of left if they didn't have my debit card. Their customer service is garbage even under new management. They didn't even greet us they just said the total and stuck their hand out for payment. Do no recommend this place to anyone their food isn't worth the disrespect."}
{"text":"Great, great, great!!!!  My wife and I got hooked on this place when there used ot be one up in North Central Pho (7th AVe and Camelback). They hand make their tortillas, all the meats are good and seem pretty authentic. Salsita is the bomb (and I'm sure I gained close to 20 pounds during the year or so I was living in the house i own nearby). Their carnitas is the best I've ever had. They have a great salsa bar with super good somewhat runny guacamole, yum. The Torta Cubana is the real jewel on the menu, all though I never had anything there I didn't like. Top off your meal with a Horchata and your in So Pho food heaven. Don't forget to try the super nachos (best with carnitas, IMHO)"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years. They used to set up a grill outside on Friday and Saturday nights and sell tacos. There would be a huge line and I would go every week but they said the city made them stop doing it. 
Still one of the best places in Phoenix for authentic Mexican tacos. I love the tacos, try them all! Shrimp burritos are good also and try the ceviche tostadas. 

They have Salcitas all over the valley but for some reason I would drive a bit further to go to this one as they were better. I think it was one of the first ones they built.

This place is \"in da hood\" and most people you will see here speak better spanish than english but if you love authentic Mexican tacos like I do this is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Fianc√© and I have been here two times for take out and always been satisfied with our visit. The lady at the drive thru is very friendly and always gives us extra condiments. This place is pretty far from us, but because of her we will be coming back here more when we are craving Mexican take out food."}
{"text":"If only I could give zero stars I would. This is beyond horrible customer service. The employees and manager are very and I mean very, very rude.  I'm never going back to this location."}
{"text":"One of the employees took my cell phone thanks to find my iphone app i found my cell phone  inside their kitchen one of the employees as soon as she heard the cell phone ring (ping) she took off the restaurant. Very disappointed with this location."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly nice on the inside and has a wide array of menu options.

This is not just another ***bertos it is a hybrid seat down place.

You sit, get a menu that's not on the wall, and then order to a person at your table.  The menu if full of great options from traditional plates and Mexican fare like burritos and tacos, to less seen in the gringo world real gorditas.

Your meal will start with chips that come with some salsa bean mix on top.  I am not sure if it is veg so be sure to ask them to leave it off if you care. There is a salsa bar with one of the best red salsas I have had in a long time, green salsa, avocado dip, carrots, pico and a crock pot of beans again probably not veg.

Prices are pretty good my chillie rellno plate was on special for $6 a huge plate with rice beans tortillas (corn or flour) and a great large chillie rellno.

Sure this may be a bit west of the trendy down town but it's worth a try."}
{"text":"super rudeee drive thru employe !!!! do something about it managers !!! little short chub lady!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love salsitas. I do. Gone through alot of of my lunch at the one near Thomas and 69nth avenue. But this one-oh Lord, let me tell you how I much I regretted coming here. I'll enumerate the things that makes this place unhygienic and very unsafe to eat to. Just a disclaimer I had to eat something at the moment when we choice this place. Its for medications and  due to experience we had on the other place, we stop by and grabbed something to eat. So here's the list of what's wrong with this place:

1. The burritos we ordered were smothered with oil. Just oil. 
2. The flavor? nowhere to be found, I had to pour some salt- Yes! Salt, when was the last time you had to put salt on your burrito!?
3. The Pina colada which brought me to try salsitas in the first place (in the 69th avenue spot) had a weird taste, if Iam betting with my money it's the taste of a spoiled milk or something. Needless to say I didn't finished that drink.
4. The cook was lazy, I watched as he cooked our food and to my surprise he seems less interested making food- more like toss food and be done with it. 
5. The spot where you get hot sauce, it was dirty. The lettuce they have lying there looked like it's been  there for days. 
6. The restroom is the worst restroom I have ever seen, the stop restrooms along the route 66 are way better kept than this. Lights flickering, no tissue, doesn't flush, human waste in the bowl!?! smh.
7. The burrito was hallow, I mean if you go buy a 8 dollar burrito you would expect something that is packed with meat and everything they advertised i.e, but for some reason the burritos we had, felt very empty.

As I said if only I didn't have to eat something for my medication at that time I wouldnt take more than 1 bite with the food... My Gf finished half of her food, she said that the food didn't sit well on her - just like me we both agreed were not coming back to this place. If not for the meds I just took, right after eating I would go to the restroom and force myself to puke the food I just ate. Sorry for the word but I really felt like I just ate something that was not cooked well, rushed, and very unhealthy. 

For a place that is situated right next to a ranch market and food city, they seem to have a weird way of showing freshness with their food. Also there's tons of Mexican food restaurants nearby, for a place that is surrounded by them, they seem to have no will to compete at all.

Sorry if my review is too long and too much info, but wanted to show where Iam coming from. We end up getting different food elsewhere. For almost 30 dollars, I felt a ripped off. Please dont be like me- don't go here."}
{"text":"Fresh beans and rice everyday ingredients are cooked daily ! I'm a regular when I'm near!"}
{"text":"great food clean ,comfortable atmosphere,  great service, great hugos. Fresh salsa, Fresh food. It's an old building, that's nice on the inside. Try it I'm sure you'll love it too."}
{"text":"Lunchtime in Phoenix is too saturated by mid-level Mexican restaurants to try a random place and risk the possibility of it being 'just average'.  Luckily, I am your voice on the streets, who will do exactly this kind of thing, especially since I work in So Pho and most of the restaurants down south are mama-y-papa variations of similar Sonoran fare.  

La Salsitas used to be a Taco Bell before they wrapped up shop and moved in with their unlikely bed-mate, Long John Silvers.  Good thing, because this restaurant is a large promotion over steam-pressed quesadillas and oily heat-lamp chips ... though I digress.

I walked up to the counter, greeted by a friendly attendant, and waited for her to shoot first; was this gonna be a Spanish dialogue or did she recognize my American Apparel gear?

\"Hola!\"

\"Hola.\"

\"Bregueareareaopoaludlauoposadaeaopoaludlauoposadaadaeaopoa ...\"

\"Oh.  Can I have a Pollo Asado Burrito, and does that come with rice and beans?\"

\"Ah, yes, it does.\"

\"Bueno.\"

I make my way over to their salsa bar, which is impressive.  Very cool.  They had pico, salsa verde, and the benchmark of any proud Mexican joint, salsa rojo.  I grab a mini-Dixie cup of all three.  Score.  I also notice that as is typical of genuine Mexican dives, they have the assortment of random veggies and peppers.  One of the tins had a jalapeno, serrano, and carrot mix and another tin had sliced radishes.  For what the purpose this served was, I don't know, but it totally reassured my choice of lunch this day.

La Salsitas tortillas are hand-made, though I found them slightly too flaky.  I usually prefer my tortillas a bit chewier.  Still, they were fresh and complimented my polla asada beautifully.  The chicken was charred 'just right', and they filled the burrito with plenty of guac.  Yum.  Something worth mentioning is their inclusion of sour cream as a side on your plate.  This is becoming more and more of a rarity in Mexican restaurants, for whatever reason, so it was a welcome sight.

The beans were perfect.  Refried and goo'ed up with white cheese.  The rice was tasty too, but had a mass-produced rigidity to the grains.  The flavor was tip-top tho.

Coincidentally, La Salsitas salsa's were very fresh and delicious.  I preferred the pico and the verde to the rojo, as it was a little too pasty and not fiery enough, but still pretty good.

Also of note, La Salsitas serves the most insane looking licuados, which had me clutching myself for fear of asking for a quick keg-stand or maybe even making a 'licuado run'.  Their strawberry looked frothy and delicious (and as mentioned in another review, Mexis LOOOVE their fresa), as did the melon.  They also had horchata.  It was hard not to get one as my drink, but, for me, its too difficult to drink something akin to a dessert as my gullet cleanser.  I stuck with a Dr Pepper instead.

They also had an impressive dessert display with pies, flan, and other pastry.  

If you like most of the average Mexican food in the Valley, there is a good chance you will enjoy La Salsitas."}
{"text":"Food was tasty but customer service and policies are terrible. I went through the drive thru to order my food and asked for the salsa and guacamole sauce. They told it's free if I come in but they charge you for it in the drive thru, huh? I explained that I was handicapped and showed proof with the handicapped placard and asked if they would make the exception and get it for me. They said no. I even asked the manager and the answer was still no. Without the sauce my food was a little dry. They already increased their prices and now they've come up with another way to get more money.  Needless to say, I will not go this establishment ever again!"}
{"text":"Nothing as Mexican food two hard tacos that tasted crap!!! Not too happy with my order and rude customer service in the drive Thur. It looks like the lady  was in a bad mood unable to explain the menu... sorry I wouldn't go back..I will rather go to McDonald's... that's how bad experience was...the lady charge extra cause I paid with debit card but my receipt said I paid cash!?!?!"}
{"text":"Best burritos I've had in a while 
Made to order food was nice and hot off the grill kind of hot, I don't mind that at all 
Good service and atmosphere 
They have a drive thru which is convenient
California burrito isn't on the menu, but I definitely recommend it!!! 
Thank you to the kind woman in the drive thru for helping with my order 

Damaris (nice woman in drive thru)
Much√≠simas gracias"}
{"text":"Food is decent, ordered carne asada fries. I received a plate of soft under cooked fries topped with a plain cheese sauce that made my fries more like a carne asada fries goulash."}
{"text":"My family and I went this afternoon for lunch since we were in the area.  My husband, who is Colombian, had what we call Mexican food in the valley and was not impressed as everything had the same taste.  He liked the food here, which wasn't topped with the regular cheddar cheese that a lot of Mexican restaurants have for Americans.

We ordered a chicken burrito, something that was a carne asada over fries with everything on it, and a three rolled taco plate that included beans and rice.  Oh, we ordered a large Pepsi and a large horchata.  All that came to $27, which I thought was a bit steep and don't understand how it came out to be that much, but, anyway.

The portions were large, as my husband and I shared the carne asada papas fritas.  Our daughter only ate half the burrito, as it was huge.  Our son only ate half of his plate.  The next time we will just get two large sodas between the 4 of us.  And, we only need to get 2 plates of food and split it, because 3 plates is really too much for 4 people.

The people that worked there barely spoke English, but they knew enough to take my order, which I did in English, with some clarification.  My husband speaks fluent Spanish, but he didn't need to help me out, so that was good.

He was a little leery of stopping by anywhere to eat in the area because it didn't look nice compared to where we lived, but I said it was fine in the daytime and the food is probably much better than the area where we live, at least catered more towards Mexicans rather than Americans.  

We liked the salsa bar, which had a slightly spicy creamy avocado sauce that was so yummy and a host of other spicy sauces.  It also had a variety of veggies that you can add to compliment your meal.

Their soda fountain doesn't work, the one that's in the eating area, so if you want a refill on your large soda, you'll have to ask them to refill.  No charge for that, but if you want to refill the large horchata, it'll be another $1.50.

I wish we had a place that had good food like this near where we lived, but alas, we don't know any place.  We'll be back next week as we have business in the area, but after that, dunno.

We are happy with the tasty food.  Price was a bit more than we thought, but, it's all right."}
{"text":"Tacos alpastor and carnitas were great!  The grilled onions and jalape√±os were a plus!  Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Okay, it looks like the other guy holding a beer in his picture already wrote an elaborate review.  So I'll keep mine short.

2:00am, headed home from downtown Phoenix with a friend craving carne asada.....  BINGO!  Great burritos 24 hours a day and a fantastic salsa bar, including marinated carrots.  That is all I have to say."}
{"text":"Omggggg so so so good. I have a theory that the best Mexican is from the west side of the 17...this place upholds that theory. 
I was admittedly sketched out about the exterior of the place, but the interior is super super clean! 
I had a guava and mango liquado... Made fresh with REAL fruit! So amazing! 
Had the three taco plate. I liked the table salsa that came with the chips and the guacamole salsa... Not a fan of the other salsas. The lengua was amazing... So much more flavorful than everywhere else I've been getting lengua lately. The asada was great and so was the AL pastor. 
Seriously... Come here. Have REAL Mexican. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Carne Asada burrito to go. The goods: properly seasoned, good flavor, and an adequate amount of meat. The bads: I specifically requested no pico and they put it on anyway (not an ingredient you can really take out once the mistake is made). Also every bite of my burrito, I hit a pocket of gristly meat forcing me to dig into my mouth to pull out chunks of fat/cartilage. I ate a little over half of the burrito before I just got sick of all the gristle so I threw the burrito and pile of gristle away. I don't expect pieces of tenderloin in my burrito but for over seven dollars, the quality is completely unacceptable. I won't be back and could not recommend this restaurant to a friend."}
{"text":"Great lunch. We all had Liquados, and they were great. All of the food we ordered tasted great. The service was quick and friendly. You get chips and salsa right away and they have a salsa bar with avocado salsa too. They make fresh juices and Liquados an they have desserts. It's clean and they have an A health rating. Plus the health inspector came in and inspected while we were here and they left as if it were all good. So even better."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the service here. Very clean and well attended by all staff. The food was delicious and quick to receive. Kid friendly."}
