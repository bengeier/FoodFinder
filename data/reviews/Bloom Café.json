{"text":"I tried their specialty - blooming teas!  It's a teaball that opens into a flower!  Watch in awe!  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  April 10,2010 I walked by this place and it is now closed and a different business/restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner the other night and had the rice balls (onigiri). I had spicy tuna (regular) and bulgogi (grilled) and both were great. The spicy tuna had a real kick to it which I enjoyed. But the I really preferred was the grilled (yaki) bulgogi.   Prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is great as well."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best chai lattes I've ever had.   I mean it. It had a spicy zing to it and you could tell it was hand seasoned and prepared with care. Incredibly tasty.   Bloom also has a full breakfast and lunch menu including scrambled tofu and soups - I ordered the butternut squash soup and it came in a beautiful teardrop-shaped bowl and was garnished with hulled sunflower seeds and a few slices of bread. I scooped up every last drop of the soup with the bread and marvelled at how awesomely flavourful it was.  Service a bit slow - one of those places that takes a long time to get the bill, to the point that you wonder if maybe it's counter pay service only."}
