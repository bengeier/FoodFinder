{"text":"My first experience at Calton's was excellent. It was Chinese New Year and the food we ordered was so fresh and delicious. The second experience of ordering takeout was less than great. The food I ordered was a bit dry, over cooked and stale tasting. I'll have to try it a third time to decide if they just had an off day when I ordered takeout. They offer a dim sum as well so I'm looking forward to trying that."}
{"text":"Love this place. Free soup everyday when you dine in. Big portion and tasty. Go back almost every week."}
{"text":"Caltons is in the space that Tango used to occupy.  The inside looks a little different from before.  I think they got rid of the bar and the some booth seating in the middle of the space.  We were here for dim sum on a Sunday.  They seated us right away at the awkward seating area towards the southeast corner of the restaurant.  It is a little tight in there but there weren't that many people in that area when we were there.    The service was not bad either, but due to where we were seating the waitresses only came around when they were coming by to drop off food.  Dim Sum dishes are $4.95 to $6.95... which is pretty much in line for dim sum nowadays with inflation and the higher minimum wage.  The food was okay I thought.  While certainly not the best dim sum in the city, having one more dim sum place in the city is definitely not a bad thing. I will return for dim sum or even dinner if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Caltons is located in a strip mall with free parking, corner of McKnight Blvd and Edmonton Trail.  We walked into a nice, clean restaurant with red and black furniture.  The lady who waited on us is really nice and pleasant.  She speaks good English and so we communicated well.    We asked if there was free soup.  The waitress said it was a bit early yet but if it's ready, she will bring out the soup.  We ordered the following: - Pan Fried Shrimp with Dragon Fruit - love this sweet dish with the dragon fruit.  The shrimp is lightly battered in a sweet reddish sauce. - XO fried beans with strips of pork - love this dish!  The XO beans were nicely fried and that pork was so tender. - Chef's Special: Oyster Omelette - \"Chinese Pizza\" is what the waitress called it!  LOL  Liked the fish sauce to dip the oyster omelette in.    We had finished dinner and the waitress came out with 3 bowls of free soup!  It was such a good broth with pork, pork bones, bok choy.  It was after we ate but who cares, it's good soup and it's free!  Then, we were served free dessert - taro, lentils sweet milky soup.  Deilsh!   Excellent service!  Will definitely come back again!"}
