{"text":"Wow.

I may very well have eaten the best meal of 2012 and January isn't even over.

Yours Truly is a welcomed addition to Toronto's restaurant landscape. Chef Jeff Claudio has been heralded in a lot of reviews for his impressive resume that includes stints at Per Se and Noma. This isn't undeserved hype, this kid knows how to cook.

I ordered an Old Raj off the signature cocktail menu to start. It was a mixture of rum, ginger, and masala bitters--yes, masala--and it was FANTASTIC.

My girlfriend and I opted to go for the tasting menu. She got veg, I got meat. Standout on the menu had to be the Trout. It was cooked to perfection with black radish and brown sugar (or was it butter) emulsion to complement it.

Everyone around us was ordering off the small plates menu and me and my girlfriend began debating whether or not we had made the right choice going with the  prix fixe. Still hungry after our prix fixe, our server suggested we try the SALTED COD saying that it was \"the best thing that ever happened to him\". That was enough of an endorsement. As others have said before me, the salted cod is prepared like a maki roll with homemade horseradish mayo to dip and it is AMAZING. Wow, just wow. I could've eaten 20 of these things.

Finally, our dessert came: a cake topped with muesli and foamed yogurt. It all went together, bite by bite. I ended up eating my girlfriend's.

Welcome to Toronto, Yours Truly."}
{"text":"I've dined here twice: once for the 20-something course Carte Blanche menu, and again for the 4-course Yours Truly menu. Had a bit of an issue with my vegetarian options the first time around, but I raised it with the manager/owner and he (and his staff) really spoiled us when we came back. If you're a foodie, you'll be in heaven... especially if you're a vegetarian who has a hard time finding something out of the ordinary! The dishes are well explained, and so creatively put together - both in terms of flavour, and presentation - definitely a unique dining experience."}
{"text":"Finally made it here after making reservation two weeks in advance! Love the ambiance of the place, dark & intimate yet relaxed and unpretentious. Went for the $55 four course tasting menu where we got to choose either meat or vegetarian for each course. The theme of the night was Italian but it the dishes were surprisingly unique combining unexpected ingredients and texture. Overall a great place for a late night cozy dinner with small group of friends. I took off one star only because I found the food to be a little on the salty side. 

Love: ambiance, simple yet innovative menu, yummy free snacks in between each courses (oysters, olives, bread, dips)!

Hate: hard to get reservation, average cocktails nothing too exciting."}
{"text":"Nice meal with the hubby on a Friday night. We opted for the 4 course meal. By the end of the meal, we were stuffed and happy to have chosen the lighter tasting menu.

Creativity was visible in the dishes that came out, but nothing that really stood out as spectacular in my mind. 

The ambiance was quite nice. The servers were attentive and helpful with explaining the dishes."}
{"text":"I've visited this great new spot twice in the past two weeks. My first experience was so wonderful, that I was left waiting for an excuse to go back. I had been in great company, the drinks were delicious, and I found myself thinking about what I had eaten as I was crawling into bed later that night. I've never thought about a meal hours later, I have typically forgotten what I actually ate altogether. But the delicious, eclectic and thoughtful dishes on the YT menu are not to be forgotten. 

An old friend happened to be visiting Toronto last night, my wish granted, I could go back for more.  Wednesday night YT offers their small plate menu, prices ranging from $5-$9, it is great for sharing and trying a variety of different things. But trust me, you will leave with a full belly. The meal is perfectly timed, be it by accident or divine intention, servers bring out dishes at precisely the right moment.  The service is simply outstanding, no one sounds pretentious as they explain the culinary genius of what you are about to enjoy. Nothing is rushed. The atmosphere is laid-back and trendy; you can tell the owners are all from beautiful BC (I'll admit my bias as I am also an ex-Vancouverite). 

I am in awe of the creativity and talent of chef Jeff Claudio. Our group (of 5) debated at length our favourite dish. Unanimously we enjoyed everything. Picking between the Pork Ssam, Salt Cod, and feature salmon wrap proved impossible. We had thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, and I know you will too. You might want to call ahead and make a reservation, as this hot spot fills up!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner recently. Me and wifey got there early, so we had a drink at the bar. She ordered the \"super whisky\" or something along those lines, but the bartender warned her that it was a really boozy drink and she changed her order to something else. Naturally, I immediately ordered said boozy drink. It was a good drink, but I've had boozier. 

Then we were seated. One person at our table showed up wasted, asked the server when the \"Elk\" was coming (there was no mention of Elk on the menu), then left to go pass out. Another person is a super picky eater and only ate like 1 out of 10 things, leaving me with essentially 2 of each main course and 3 deserts, which I easily ate. 

Pros:

- Great tasting and well-presented food
- Very unique concept
- Cool drink menu 
- Good staff

Cons:

- Expensive
- Small portions
- Limited seating"}
{"text":"The first bites are fun but they all feel half-baked (garlic knots have good taste, but don't excel etc.) The potato cakes were undercooked. Oyster wasn't memorable (I forgot about it til my friend reminded me).

The first course--veal over cream sauce and brussel sprouts-- was probably my favourite. It was chewy and fun. The orata--or...fish--was over salty with olives. Not my cup of tea. Suckling pig is over done (had it as the main at Toqu√©! last night...)

Dessert was nice, loved the icecream. 

3 stars because it was overpriced for what it was. The seating was miserable and they didn't regulate the heating very well. I was super uncomfortable for all 80 courses. This probably influenced my review."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst ever!!! The flavors were off, the portions were tiny (we left hungry and had to go someplace to eat again), the service was bad even though it was 1/2 empty, it took 50 minutes for us to get a bread basket with numerous requests. The bread basket was small, and greasy. Every course had this same yogurt/sour cream base that was just bad and yet they included in nearly dish...I cant say anything good about the place and yet they even knew we were a dining group, and we communicated we were hungry and it didn't matter. This was the first time in my dining groups' history that we actually left a restaraunt hungry and had to go someplace else to eat...don't waste your money. The concept of the restaraunt is very 80's with small portions and a nasty sauce accompanying each course and in each one the sauce covered up the taste of the food, so you never got the full flavors...save your money and try Union down the block instead."}
{"text":"It's sincere what they want to do, ya know, provide an exp, controlled, sequenced, always a bit surprising, understated, but ... yeah, of course, there is a but ... if feels put-on, a show, a dazzle, razmejaz (what does that mean?), just unsubstantial and not centred on the pleasure of food, it has the feeling of being an imitation of fine dining at more reasonable prices (45 for tasting, darn good, right?).

Think it was 7 - 8 courses, came quick, should, I guess, only two sets to cook, service, easy, efficient, smiley (not so easy is this?  not the grim reaper?  not the preten-snob?  not the over-bubbly, just affable and competent, is that so much to ask?), wait, plates were brought out by sous-chefs or chefs, I think I recall now, that was fun.

In general, the plates didn't make me want to .. um .. eat them ... I just thought they were interesting, and this is sth different ... but flavours and texture ... well, yeah, focus on making that mouth exp to take precedent over the visual or intellectual aspects of cooking.  You can dress it up and funk with the ingred, mix it up, but it's gotta work together, magically.

I felt I was tasting experiments as opposed to refined, well-rounded, closed to perfected ideas, sth that took time and exp to get right.  Instead, I felt like they're having a lark or are not stringent enough on what works, everyone is too nice, and no one wants to say your dish, uh, needs work.

Love the spirit of trying out new, but try it out a lot more on yerselves and be far more exacting, demanding, then, eureka, when it works, bring it out.

Work on a few master-pieces, keep them in rotation, get them perfect, as you're constantly exploring and finding something that excites you.

I hate to eat rough drafts."}
{"text":"My brother recommended \"Your Truly\" having heard rave reviews. The food was actually a joke. The menu consists of a prix fixe list of eight items of which you choose four options from. Our menu that night looked something like this:

Carrot         Mackerel
Egg             Herring
Mushroom  Chicken
Chocolate   Cheese

The idea is to choose four items total - one from each of the rows - to make up your meal. I chose carrot, egg, chicken and chocolate. My brother and I (joined by our mother) chose opposing dishes so that we could try everything. I started with the carrot. It was literally a freaking carrot... as in one measly carrot on a plate. It was a smoked carrot with smoked carrot cream on the side. We should have gotten up and left after that. It tasted so awful I could barely finish it. My mother and I just had to laugh at it and hope for the best with the rest of the meal. 

Let me add in here that the kitchen provides \"snacks\" - little amuse bouches before and after the first course. Little garlic bread knots, prosciutto slices, a kimchi grapefruit palate cleanser and oysters. These snacks were actually the best part of the meal. 

Next came the egg dish. The presentation was neat - with an interesting oval dish with a circular  bowl centre set to look like a hard boiled egg cut in half. This dish was a take on eggs benny. It included a very lightly poached egg (unappetizingly raw), prosciutto, and croutons covered in hollandaise sauce. Nothing special. I've had a million times better and could make a better eggs benny myself. 

Also to note here, the waitress informed us at the beginning of the meal that the left-hand column  was supposed to be vegetarian options. This dish, however, had prosciutto in it? something's off there...

The chicken was nasty chicken thigh meat, practically inedible, and the chocolate dessert was OK. But there was some sort of chocolate piece still frozen on the plate. We literally couldn't eat it because it was rock solid. Maybe the chef was trying to insult us? Not sure. My brother had the cheese plate dessert. It was so sad. I watched him trying to enjoy it, because he stil hadn't given up hope on this place, being the hipster, foodie enthusiast that he is. He had to nibble at the three measly slices of cheese on his plate in order to make them last more than the ten seconds it should have taken to gobble them up. 

Then the bill... including two cocktails, it was so effing expensive! Mind you, we knew that it was going to be $55.00 per person for the prix fixe menu... it was still such a sad feeling to know we just paid almost $250.00 for a meal that probably costed $3.00 to make. 

Overall, it was not good. Not good at all."}
{"text":"Service was great and food is deeeeeeeelicious.  If there are 2 of you, I would highly recommend getting only one tasting menu (either veg or meat) and get yourself alllllll the starters to share!"}
{"text":"Came here on a random Wednesday night, luckily my boyfriend and I were able to get seated at the bar right away. 

All the better to enjoy the nice ambiance of the place and watch drinks get mixed! Definitely has a great atmosphere, from just the calm lighting, beautiful walls and counters, and the little pickled jars sitting on the shelves. 

But.... not too hot about the food itself. Maybe we just so happened to order the not-so-great things off the menu, but then again, it was based off our server's recommendations. 

From the daily small plates menu: 

1) Pork belly tacos: the pork belly had a good flavour and I loved the cactus inside, but oil kept dripping out everywhere and the tortilla tasted really bland. 

2) Doubles: I was intrigued by this because I've wanted to try West Indian food.. but this wasn't great. Two pitas sandwiching chickpeas, with tahini yogurt sauce on top. It tasted alright, but it was really too heavy for a \"small plate\" and got boring to eat after a few bites. 

3) Salt cod: This was probably the best of the 3. Really good flavour to the sushi rice and the salt cod, and the inari was a perfect vessel. Yummm. But again with the carbs! 

I didn't like the fact that each plate seemed particularly heavy on the carbs, but maybe we just happened to choose those ones. Compared to Guu, I much prefer their more sensible portion-sizes though. 

My friend says I'd better off trying the tasting menu though -- I will be back for that!"}
{"text":"After all the positive reviews was looking forward to trying this new 'hotspot'. 
Way too overrated!!! 
The food wasn't anything to write home about, could have found better food from a grocery prepared meals."}
{"text":"I've more or less given up on Yelp reviews, but I need to give this place another 5-star rating. 

We showed up 15 minutes after opening and got a seat at the bar. The room filled up quickly. It's a nicely decorated, small room. We order the vegetarian tasting menu and some snacks: the bread with duck fat, and the salt cod. Some amuses arrive: a compressed romaine leaf with sour cream and panko, a vichysoisse with pickled beets, and a spoonful of compressed apple, apple reduction and some kind of coffee powder (I don't remember exactly what this was). The romaine was revelatory for something so simple, the vichysoisse was good and pickled beets are my favorite food item, and the apple spoon was good but not my thing (my girlfriend loved it). Out come the snacks - bread in a bag with whipped duck fat and crispy shallots. The bread is good, and there's a few different varieties in there. The salt cod inari, as others have said, is seriously amazing. One of the best things I've ever eaten. 

On to the tasting menu. A potato salad arrives, with potato chips, greens and dots of various things around it. The portion size is good (I think the kitchen was overall very generous with us since we were sharing - kudos). One of the \"polka dots\" is an egg yolk gel that I loved - this may be a high-end dining/modernist cuisine standby for all I know, but I am a student and can't normally afford this kind of food. A carrot dish comes out, with (if I recall) pickled carrots, raw carrots, carrot in brown butter (dark, rich and very sweet), more carrot of unidentifiable cooking technique, and a powder- more of the coffee/caramel one I think. It was interesting to see such worship of a single ingredient. The third course was a onion bouillon with ricotta gnocchi, foam (creme fraiche?), and crispy leeks. The leeks are weird - crispy but tough, but everything else is extremely good. The dessert was impressive: an almond panna cotta, with lychee on top of that, and meringue on top of that. There was tapioca pearls, rice pudding and rice foam to the side, with sichuan pepper on top. While I would have preferred just the rice pudding/foam/sichuan combo, everything was still good. 

I chat with the bartender a bit (who I think is one of the owners) and he has information on any technique/any part of the dishes we are eating. The cooks serve the food and are very intense and enthusiastic about what they are putting in front of you. 

I am so glad that food like this exists at a price point that isn't too high. I'll definitely be back for snacks, and  to try a meat tasting menu."}
{"text":"If your company's paying or you have an expense account, by all means go. We just got back from our vacation, ate so well in miami and vegas. Anthony Bourdain style.
Just to name a few memorable places, sage, bar masa at Cosmo, prime 112 , joe's stone crab at sobe...

Yours truly is lame. No cohesiveness or maybe I don't get the chef's creation at all. My son said my homemade king prawn pasta is way better than the lobster kale pasta - whopping 35$ for 5 bites. It is bland and unimaginative. We had the 4 course option. No wonder their menu changes everyday, because there is no signature dish or something memorable. The duck with lapcheong sticky rice is a joke. It reminds us of dimsum, lotus wrapped sticky rice which has a piece of roast duck n lapcheong (Chinese sausage). At least it is only 2.30$ compared to 55$.

Why pay that kind of price to taste various version of carrots. Smoked, marinated, pickled???  how can one go so wrong with one tiny piece of grilled white fish, I can't even remember the random ingredients surrounding the fish. I sum up the style as okay, we grilled, poached, fry the main ingredient, put a bit of kale here for coloring, drizzle with truffle oil to make it sound expensive...but the taste is random without any wow effect.

Like I said, if coming from my own hard earned money, I would rather go to Morimoto omikase in NYC and pay a little bit more to be amused deliciously by chef Morimoto.  

Good luck Yours Truly."}
{"text":"Wow, Yours Truly is like few other restaurants in Toronto. Come here if you are looking for a unique and exciting dining experience. 

I'm sure you've read by now that you choose a dish ingredient/element for each course and the rest is a surprise. I enjoyed everything they served me. There were many dishes that were unusual either in preparation, ingredients and/or presentation. While the meal is four courses, know that there will many other small dishes served to you throughout the meal. The servers explained every dish they presented to us. Talk about a lot of ingredients to memorize!

The drinks were pretty good. We sat at the bar and the bartender told us that he just redid the cocktail menu and suggested this cocktail that was sort of like a root beer float. It had a whipped cream topping, which I thought looked cool but the cocktail ended up tasting too sweet and the whipped cream didn't mix well into the drink. Oh well. You can always stick with a classic cocktail but sometimes you've got to mix it up and try something new.

I would definitely come back here because I know the menu will be completely different!

If you really liked this restaurant, want to try another place like it and are going to New York City, check out Aquavit! It's much fancier and is Swedish cuisine but it's the same amuse-bouche idea."}
{"text":"Incredible Carte Blanche menu and wonderful selection of cocktails and wine. (Wine pairing available)
Each course is an experience in itself, and full of surprise on the palate. An incredible experience if you bring an open mind!"}
{"text":"We had the four-course tasting menu and loved it.  Aside from the items in the menu, there were at least 4 snacks offered during the first two courses.  It's $55 well-spent for a great meal.

Oh, and the restaurant is casual, which is a huge plus since you can be as comfortable as you can be while sampling the delicious food."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday, with 9 friends. Warning: the largest amount of people they can accommodate at one table is 10. 

So I'm vegetarian. The food was delicious, and very filling. It wouldn't have been worth it if it weren't for the amuse bouches. They really filled us up. Sriracha devilled egg? Um, godly. It was like a super creamy dynamite roll. I liked being surprised, and I also liked that the servers explained the food in detail. Everything was meticulously layered to create masterpieces. I had a glass of 2008 Barbera. Delicious.

The atmosphere was great; perfect noise level and music.

This place is really expensive for my friends and I. They all enjoyed the food too, but it's appreciated it as an \"experience\", not really a go-to place for university students. That said, we all tipped so our main server needed to stop looking down her nose at us."}
{"text":"I will have to go back for the food but if the precision, presentation, and overall taste of the cocktails is any indication of what will come out of the kitchen, I'm sure my review will remain much the same.

This is a lovely new spot - kind of a wake up to the Ossington scene.  I appreciate that there is a snack menu and affordable glasses of wine (starting at $6) and pints of beer (starting at $5) in addition to the cocktails.  The vibe is relaxed but the design makes you feel like you're some place special, unpretentious but aware. 

After talking to the bartender a while, he gave me a sample of the ginger liquer made in-house (brandy, cognac, ginger and sugar cane).  It was superb.  I also had a pint of Steigl for $5.  

I will certainly be back to try the food and in the meantime, I can't big up the service in the place enough - they were all attentive and on point without being intrusive.

REALLY GOOD for having just opened too."}
{"text":"We were there for the carte blanche. The food was good...it was 10-15 courses meal....I would say 3-4 course was quite impressive...the rest was ok...was it worth $140/person? hmmm....still debating.. And, I only give it a 3 stars because the waitress has a bit of an attitude. Not impress. given that it wasn't a cheap meal, I would expect the service to be almost perfect. It wasn't....fail on service."}
{"text":"Save your time and money and take a pass on this place. The one star is for the nice room.  Did the 4 course tasting menu with friends Saturday night. We accept the very minuscule portion sizes- cauliflower three ways was made with three cauliflower florets each smaller than a pinky nail. The dishes although very creatively presented, were cold or Luke warm and very dull tasting. Not one dish stood out as exceptional."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here a few months ago and we're generally happy with our meal.  There were a couple of issues  with our dietary requirements,  after expressing this to the owners they were kind enough to make it up on our next visit. The exemplify VIP treatment and followed up with excellent food and customer service. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"For all the reviews, hype and the wait to get in, not my favourite place on the block. Service was good and the drinks served well, but the food average.  

A nice night and worth a visit, but there's better value on the block based on my one and maybe only visit."}
{"text":"The server was excellent.  The food was great.   And we were having a fantastic date.  And then out of nowhere, the manager told us we had to leave because the 9:30 seating had arrived (it was also only 9:20 at the time).  We had bought a bottle of wine, ordered the full menu, and then got the bum's rush before our after dinner teas arrived.  I would never go back and would never recommend it.  I asked to speak to the manager and the guy who was kicking us out was the manager.  We're both foodies, we're easy customers and don't ask for much,  But for god's sake, don't tell me I have to leave before I can drink the tea that you offered me. Never again."}
{"text":"I had been very much looking forward to my visit to Yours Truly. It turned out be just okay to look forward to.

There were a couple moments of delight, but more often, there were moments of being underwhelmed. Foam. Many types of foam. As one of my dining companions put it, \"Foam is the new parsley. They seem to top everything with foam these days.\"

Our group of four all got the 4-course tasting menu, but my favourite parts were the snacks. Little bites were served between the courses, and most of them tickled me pink. Devilled eggs, oysters, gougeres with fishy cream, garlic knots. There was a palate cleanser of pistachio, tapioca, and cardamom.

The main events were sadly underwhelming. My favourite was the smoked carrot, and those crunchy little barley bites (and foam). Grouper, mushroom (including foam) and cheese plate were just good. Complex flavours, but nothing really hitting it off in my mouth. 

Service was actually completely disappointing. Our main server seemed completely disinterested in our table, and couldn't answer a question when I asked about some black, ash-like crumbs sprinkled on my plate. She told me it was barley. It was most definitely not. 

For our group of four, our bill was $400 + tip, including the wine pairings. For more than $100 per person, I will not be returning in a hurry. Despite a lovely time with lovely company, more enjoyable food and service can be had elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  Or at least it was last night.  All the ingredients of a great restaurant - amazing food, fabulous service, excellent recommendations - without any pretension.

The menu is a prix fixe of four courses, with two options for each course ($55) - you can also add a supplemental course ($20).  You're told nothing but the main ingredient of each course, which makes each course a nice surprise, and in between you get a number of samplers - four or five throughout the meal.

All in all, the meal was fabulous.  Each dish was creative and well presented, and most importantly tasted amazing.  They didn't cut corners on the samplers in between, which included oyster, crab cakes, and fresh bannock bread.  Dessert was incredible - peanut butter sorbet with a chocolate ganache, cranberry jelly, and the most amazing melt-in-your-mouth sponge toffee I've ever had.  Even their home brewed tea (Toasty Walnut) was incredibly good.

Slight criticism was the supplement - pasta was way too salty.  Especially given that you pay extra for the supplement, I thought this was pretty disappointing.  For how amazing the rest of the meal was, though (and because I can't give half stars, but it's better than a four) I'm willing to go out on a limb and give this 5 stars.  All in all, great experience."}
{"text":"Three times is a good number of times to visit a place and really know whether they are good or bad. And this place is on the top side of good - it's fantastic. We went with friends a month or so ago and just ordered the entire menu - that's the kind of place this is. The chefs are often bringing out your food and telling you the fun things that you get with each dish.  There are also great cocktails and drinks."}
{"text":"Great tasting food like Tapas but unique gastronomy.  We tried the vegetarian and it was unique taste.  I don't know how others are but this was great.  Worth trying it once."}
{"text":"After all I heard about Yours Truly, maybe I went in with very high expectations. Had the 4 course tasting menu with a group of 3, and tried every single option on the menu. Out of the 12 dishes offered, maybe 1 was outstanding and the rest was either good or nothing special(The deviled eggs with Sriracha was as good as the reviews said it was).
Overall, the food was good but not great. Definitely not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Dear Yours Truly,

I had my doubts because of your cheesy love-letter name.
However, I heard from a friend of a friend and other Yelpers that I should give you a shot.

I'm so glad I did!  I had a wonderful time! 

This place was packed on a Thursday night.  We didn't have a reservation and were seated at the communal table.  It's cramped and the nearest coat and purse rack is the wall heater.  Even though our seating was less than ideal, we didn't mind, we just wanted eat!

We started off with drinks.  The wine list was small but their cocktails were excellent   The Shake-That-Pear ($11) was light and sweet, and refreshing.  Pear nectar and gin is a magical combination.

The food list was creative and I wish we had tried everything!

They had a rotating tasting menu (meat $45 and veggie option $35).
We decided to share small plate items, 5 items and a drink each only cost us about $70 bucks for two.

San Choi Bao: Simple Asian style lettuce wraps.  We weren't sure how to eat them without making mess.  Ripping the lettuce into small pieces and spooning in the pork and vermicelli worked perfectly.  Simple but tasty.

Salt Cod Inari: Tofu shells stuffed with sweetened rice and cod.  Sweeter than expected and filling.

Thuet Bread: Mmmm whipped duck fat:  
The bread arrived in a closed paper bag that said \"rip me open\".  It was a very fun presentation!  The duck fat was fluffy and deliciously salty and greasy.  Why can't we have duck fat and toast for breakfast instead of buttered English muffins?

Deviled eggs: Soft, creamy, and tasty.  Yep, deviled eggs.

Dessert: The yogurt-muesli dessert was good but not really one of my favourites.  The yogurt was light but I found the cake a bit hard and well, this dish was a whole lot like the breakfast I had this morning.

We enjoyed all the items we ordered.
Also, I thought the service here was spectacular.  
Friendly and chatty, the servers were busy but happy to serve you.

I had a great time here. =)
Your's Truly, I like you.

Let's see each other again soon.

- Steph L."}
{"text":"Over rated place. Food was okay, and would say good. But, there weren't any \"wow\". We tried the Chef experience menu with wine pairing.... Way too expensive for what you get. Positive: Bartender (John) was cool."}
{"text":"Went here randomly for their tasting menu and was impressed they have a pretty good vegetarian tasting menu. Each item was well crafted and tasty and overall for a tasting menu it was fairly priced (the vegetarian menu was cheaper than the regular tasting menu too)."}
{"text":"I have to say I was impressed.  I had heard some good things about Yours Truly but I really had no expectations for what dinner would consist of.  We didn't make a reservation but went a little earlier than we would normally have dinner (it was around 6:00pm).  We were seated at the communal table which has never bothered me.  I actually kind of like it, most of the time.  Feels like you are at a big dinner party.  

Anyways, as Vegetarians we normally don't have a hard time with options at most of the restaurants in Toronto.  I have to commend Yours Truly for stepping it up a notch.  Of course we got the tasting menu; a 4 course meal for $35 seemed like a great idea to me.  They have two menus every night.  A meat and a Veg.  I can't speak for the Meat but the Veg tasting menu was excellent.  It did have eggs, so some Vegetarians should be aware.  

Fantastic.  That is all.

We started with some cocktails, which were amazing and followed with a bottle of wine.  The meal was perfectly paced.  Not rushed in anyway.  One course, a few minutes to digest and have some wine, then the next course would arrive.  Exactly how a meal should be.

Highly recommend for both the food and the drinks."}
{"text":"Another in my personal tour of \"Toronto's Top New Restaurants\" 
Reservation- tough to snag, and they have two official seatings, at 6/6:30 and then 8:30/9pm (ish). Anyone walking in the door was turned away on this busy Thursday night. 
Arrival- My first impression is cool! Although it is a bit hipstery, the table and chairs are comfy. The bar area is gorgeous and I want one of those at home. There is a communal table at the front. We were seated near the front, but comfortable and not cold. 
Bar/Drinks- there is a short wine list by the glass and bottles and beers. But the cocktails are where it's at! I started with the John Candy, a big, fat glass full of bourbon, orange twist and flavour. The smaller cocktails are strong and classy. I managed to have a glass of wine during dinner, which was great as well. 
Food-Two menus are placed before you. The tapas style small plates menu and then the Chef's menu of either veg or regular.  Our table of four shared 2 small plates and then moved on to the 5 course menu. The chef sent over two or three small bites of food before our menu items even started to come out. Food restrictions and allergies can be accomodated for. My favorite item- the mousse of squash and yogurt with quinoa.  Mushrooms played prominently based on the season. They came out in a few different styles of dishes and I loved all of them. Some people who don't love mushrooms also enjoyed them. Dessert was pretty cool, but very light and I still had 'room left' for somehting a bit more heavy. 
Service- Even though this isn't a white table cloth kind of place, I was awed that there were so many servers who brought the food for 4 people all at the same time. The chef came out himself to describe one of the courses. The waitress was not intrusive and very cool. 
This place is new, like nothing else. Small food, so order plenty of small plates before the fixed price menu. I'd totally love to come back and hope they will add some wine pairings with each course."}
{"text":"I found Yours Truly on my way home one day from Beaconsfiled Village. I was really impressed and couldn't be any more pleased. This eatery and bar has something for everyone. It is the perfect spot to bring family and friends that are coming from out of town as it is sure not to disappoint! Reservations are accepted, but on the particular evening that we went, we did not make a reservation. Their service was amazing, and not having a reservation did not delay my friends and I from getting a table. 

Little fact:  They get their honey from Osprey Bluffs Honey Company, which is a personal favorite of mine :)"}
{"text":"I cannot speak highly enough of this place.  The menu options are great.  The ideology of the menu and how foods are served is brilliant.  A daily rotating tasting menu?  Buh Rilliant!  Each dish was full of flavor, thought, and gorgeous presentation.  The entire staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and into the experience.  A mocktail menu did not exist, however the bartender made a point of making me non alcoholic drinks throughout the night.  This is not a quick experience, nor should it be. Plan on being there for a couple of hours.  The chef came out to meet us, again that's just great service."}
{"text":"$30 for two dishes:

- 8 random leafs and dressing and finger tip sized cheese  
- a highlighter sized squash with a single mushroom

what a waste of time"}
{"text":"Ordered all eight options for the 4-course tasting menu. With a buzzing Toronto Life review, unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations (perhaps the standard was better before Jeff Claudio left). 

Pros:
- Plenty of complementary dishes (4-5)
- Some dishes took big risks and were admirably creative
- Ingredients were indeed fresh
- Relatively inexpensive when compared to other tasting menus (e.g. Canoe, Splendido, Auberge)

Cons:
- None of the dishes were particularly memorable or outstanding
- Dishes were inconsistent (the table next to us ordered the same menu but their dishes were plated completely differently (even the plates were different) and they even had some extra elements on their dishes that we did not have (e.g. they had a foam on one of their dishes while ours didn't have it)
- Free dishes were not the same for every table (different tables received different free courses, and they seemed to favour tables that ordered alcoholic beverages), which created a sense of resentment when we saw that other tables received far more and better free dishes than us
- Inconsistent wait times in between dishes -- sometimes they would bring the next dish before we had even finished our dish and sometimes we had to wait 15-30 minutes for the next dish to come
- The cutlery was not changed after every dish (only changed once or twice throughout the entire meal)
- Cutlery was largely inconsistent (my girlfriend and I's cutlery were often shaped differently, and sometimes spoons were silver while others were unintentionally steel)
- No complementary bread
- Restrooms were disappointingly unclean (by fine dining standards) -- this is usually a good indicator of the cleanliness of a restaurant's kitchen"}
{"text":"one of everything

You hear it, and it's an eye-roller.  But you see it, and it's quite the eye-pleaser.  Yours Truly has one of the nicest bars I've seen in a while.  The concrete tables and copper drop lights are urban accents you would expect to find at a hip resto-bar.  And at about 9, the lights turn down low, and music goes up.

I find Yours Truly's story endearing.  It was going to be a \"snack bar\" until Jeff Claudio was hired - off of Craigs List by the way.  Claudio has worked at some of the world's most notable restaurants, one of which (Rockpool) I will be trying in a few months (can't wait!).

Their menus are ever-changing, but there are only three.  Two set (veggie and not) and one snack.

Of all the things I loved about Yours Truly, the most notable was who brought us our food.  Their chefs.  That's right.  They make it and then bring it to your table to walk you through it.  Love that.

Last Sunday my sister and I met up with The Scotsman and Venus to grab a drink and sample the snacks.  A lot of that menu is more preparation than cooking, but either way, food boils down to concept.  The chef has an idea and then he brings it to fruition.  I would describe it as a gastronimcal pub with classic charm.  Some of Yours Truly's ideas weren't innovative, others were, but all of them were presented beautifully, and tasted near perfect.

The four of us joked that we should just get one of everything.  But then you know, that's exactly what we did.  

Deviled Eggs - sriracha , furikake, sesame.  The srirachi was a dollop of genius.
Salt Cod - inari, kewpie, nori, rice.  My favourite things in one bite.
Thuet Bread with whipped duck fat and crispy shallots.  Cutest presentation ever. Duck. Fat. OMG.  Although we agreed there could have been more shallots.  
Monforte Cheese with osprey bluffs honey.  A well thought out pairing.
Salmon Sashimi - sour apple, white soy mustard, shaved foie gras.  I would like to squirt white soy mustard on everything.
Rice Pudding - usually not a fan, but this one was really delicious.

I just checked their menu today.  They have a chinese pork rice bowl and a behirir moroccan pancake.  They're calling us.  You free tonight?"}
{"text":"Maybe the problem was that I have wanted to go here for so long that I built it up too much in my mind?

I had an impromptu friend-dinner-date last night and basically strong-armed him into coming here, after I called and heard they had some open tables. The menu format seems to have changed a bit. As another reviewer noted, they have a sort of 3x4 matrix where you pick one option from each row, ending up with 4 dishes for $45. I had the \"vert\", the trout, the terroir and the berries. 

As almost everyone has noted, the portions are small. Like, seriously small. These truly cannot be meant for sharing. However, they are certainly tasty. The vert was a composed salad which used milk as the main liquid for the dressing. It was very tasty, and went with my incredible, just incredible...did I mention it was incredible? Ontario chardonnay. My trout was cooked perfectly (i.e. not overdone) and the terroir was a surprisingly tasty plate of basically just undressed vegetables, some cooked, some raw, and some pickled with sauces on the side.

The highlight was definitely the dessert. My berries came with frozen, almost freeze-dried elderflower ice cream crumbled on top. My friend had the spruce, which was spruce ice cream under a pyramid of meringue, surrounded by what can best be described as salty hazelnut sugar dust. The salty-sweet-creamy-crunchy contrast was heavenly. 

Would I come back? For sure, eventually. It's a great date spot. But let's just say the waiter wasn't surprised when my friend mentioned he was ready for some pho...in fact, he recommended a good Malaysian place down the street!"}
{"text":"Well payed Yours Truly. Well played. I called on Friday morning, to see if there was a reservation available, and I lucked out! Someone had just cancelled, and so I had a seat at 6:30 that very same night. There was no more than a moments wait when we arrived, and the service was excellent through the night. I do wish there had been somewhere to hang our coats, as I was wearing a long white dress coat, and it ended up slung over the back of my chair dragging on the ground.

We ordered a $45 meat tasting menu, and four of the tasting dishes to share ($6-$12 each dish I believe). The stand outs were the duck which came with the meat menu, the salmon sashimi and the Thuet bread with whipped duck fat. (Ever since this meal I have been envisioning way to include more duck fat in my life...)

It wasn't until after we were done our dinner that I remembered having read an article about a new resto in Toronto where the chef has an impressive resume. Noma, Alinea, Thomas Keller? I pulled out my phone at the table (a major no-no in almost all circumstances), and checked it out. It WAS this place. And I have to say, I'm not surprised. The chef had a sophistication that I found very impressive. There was a nice mix of flavours, and styles, but everything just worked.

Also, I had the John Candy cocktail ($12), and it was FANTASTIC. Rye, maple, ginger and bitters. Just order it. 

$160 for dinner for two with 2 drinks each (no coffee or dessert, other than the one included in the tasting menu)"}
{"text":"If you've ever wondered what it might be like to lick the floor of a tasty, tasty forest, like maybe you were on some weird culinary foraging tour led by Willy Wonka, then you just might get your wish by taking part in this restaurant's Carte Blanche 20-course tasting menu in which endless magical bites are delivered to your table and that tasty forest to which I'm referring materialized as delicately fried lichen balls that arrived perched atop a single branch, and as I popped the delightfully crunchy hybrid of fungus and algae with a tiny dollop of cream into my mouth I began to wonder whether or not Yoko Ono dressed as a faerie nymph would emerge in a flourish from the kitchen to serve me a thimble of absinthe to pair it with."}
{"text":"I was finally able to get a reservation at Yours Truly after hearing so much about it. Unfortunately, they got rid of their snack menu, so I was dissappointed that I didn't have the chance to try their infamous duck fat bread. The space is not overtly complicated looking--I would say pretty minimalist with the bar being focal point of the room. The drinks were really good so they're a must-try.

We got the $45 tasting menu, and the courses are designed after a specific ingredient.  I chose beef, egg, chicken and berries. Do not expect big portions. I typically hate people that complain about portions at fine dining restaurants, but do expect really small portions.  You're not going to leave Yours Truly being satisfied, but you will acknowledge that it was a good tasting meal. The food was great, I just wish there had been more.

The beef was a tartar.  What I liked was that it had chunkier pieces of beef which gave the texture an extra kick, as opposed to other tartars. The egg dish was the star of the whole course. It was served in a concave dish and truly undescribeable in taste.  Truly genius. The chicken was not memorable, but the dessert, which were liquid nitrogen berries was delicious--i just wish there were more berries.

Overall, it is a great spot to come and grab a great drink. Unfortunately, my bill exceeded my level of satisfaction."}
{"text":"I have a dairy allergy, however the food was prepared taking that into consideration. Every morsel was delicious. I thought the portions looked small, but left feeling quite satisfied. No need to go big or go home here. It's not a fastfood joint. Especially enjoyed my ginger cocktail. It was heavenly."}
{"text":"Have you ever wondered where to dine if you're a midget with an eating disorder?  This is the place.

I am from New York and I have had my fair share of interesting or even weird and/or hip dining experiences.  Unfortunately, the only thing 'Yours Truly' provided was a disgusting taste in my mouth and hunger in my belly.

The portions were laughable.  If the kitchen used haute cuisine ingredients, I would completely understand and would commend them for wanting their dishes to boast with taste, not quantity.  However, our first course was a selection of wilted greens?  I'm not sure exactly what it was....in a petri dish sized plate with thousand island dressing that looked watery and tasted underwhelming to say the least.

The highlight of the evening, ( I ordered the veg option ) was a poached egg that was under-cooked and bordered by potato chips.  

The dessert was a tasteless pudding that looked like it came from the planet 'WTFisthisandwhyamIeatingit'

Maybe I'm just not hip enough to \"get it\".

This is definitely not a place you want to go to if you have a food allergy......they make no substitutions and just serve you whatever they feel like serving regardless of whether or not a certain ingredient will cause your throat to close and go into anaphylactic shock.  


I think if I had been drunk ( their beer and wine selection is pretty decent ) I would have been able to tolerate my meal, but that's not saying much.

Yours Truly,
Someone with actual taste

P.S.  Now I understand why hipsters are so skinny."}
{"text":"This is a great date place or a double date place.  - intimate small tables- top notch service.
Tasting menu is great- it is supplemented by other items

I would definitely come back- great intimate setting.  Perhaps higher priced than you would normally want to spend but by no means do I feel like it is poor value or do I ever feel ripped off."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that it was not bad, it was just ok.  For the amount I paid, I expected a lot more from the food.  The flavours were just ok, and the portions were extremely small.  They are going for a small taste of everything, but if it is going to be that small, it has to be more than just 5 dishes.  I was still hungry after our meal and went to another restaurant for \"drinks\" and the 5 of us ended up having drinks plus 5 medium sized appetizers and 3 desserts. 

I went with the carnivore side.  It started with a small soup that was probably the most flavourful dish all night.  It was layered and delicious.  It also came with a warm piece of homemade bread.  I can't remember the second dish, but it had I think a duck pate, raw tuna, and something in a spinach wrap.  It was just ok.  Then there was a shrimp dish which was raw, and I do enjoy sushi so the rawness did not bother me.  It just wasn't that flavourful.  The next dish was cod which was tasty but very small.  The next dish was a tiny little piece of brisket which was delicious but so small that it was just a taste.  There was popcorn on it, but it didn't really add to the dish.  The next dish was pork neck, which was not bad, just a little dry, and once again a small portion.  Then for dessert, I'm not sure what it was, but it was just ok.  It had some sort of crunchy meringue thing, that was probably the highlight of the dish.  I tried a little of the soy ice cream and I really really really really did not like it.  The consistency reminded me of phlegm, but hey, I'm not a soy fan.

Overall, portions too small, price too high, flavours not memorable.  I really wanted to like this place because of all the good things that I have heard, but I will not return and I will also be burning my \"best restaurant\" issue of Toronto Life as I feel that their reviews are not accurate and possibly biased."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the creative and delish dishes.  We each ordered the $55 prix fixe and the black truffle fettucini to share.  We were stuffed after the four courses plus the fettucini (and the amuse bouches they offered).  I really enjoyed the mushroom, and the eel and elk were pretty good too.  The ambience of the restaurant was also nice, and the service was excellent - I was extremely thirsty that day and my glass was never empty."}
{"text":"It is actually a 3.5 for me, but when i was there on their small plate menu day (Wednesday), so that this might be under rated.

Okay, I admit it might not be a good idea to order EVERY SINGLE THING on the small plate menu...... Can I say I had a tough day ??

It is hard to book a table, so my friend and I sitting at the bar, which didn't bother us at all. I took a quick look at the menu, found that the menu is very strong Asian based. (like bim bim bap, sushi , soba and satay).  Like some of the yelpers, I read about Yours Truly on Toronto life, best new restaurant, so I think I try as much as possible, so i ordered everything on the menu, except for the dessert.

Soba came first, taste okay, not surprisingly good. 

Bim bim bap came next, raw beef on top. Looks to me that it combined with the raw beef dish in Korea and bim bim bap together (i could be wrong). It taste okay, just two cold dish altogether, I start to feel a bit wired. 

And everything else came up very fast, which is a good thing most of the time. However, for us that night, it was not as good since we could eat that fast and keep on combing the sweet and savory taste, hot and cold. It created a mix in the taste bud and the stomach, not in a good way.  I don't think i could blame the restaurant at all for this. I am sure they didn't assume anyone would order everything on that menu. 

Anyways, Thuet bread was amazing, with that duck fat spread over. Say no more.

Thai Satay is okay. Although I think since it is called Thai Satay, instead of pork, maybe it should be switched back to chcken,which will have better texture. 

I like Tokyo dog the best. Best the Jap dog I had.

Pork taco.. I will still say Black Hoof is better. 

Overall, everything is good but not amazingly good plus the mix of taste, I really couldn't say I enjoyed it as much, but as I said, really don't think I should blame the restaurant. 

I really look forward to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a birthday meal after hearing good reviews. The idea of picking ingredients for surprise courses sounded fun. Sadly out of eight courses maybe one was memorable. Definite points for creativity, presentation and service. However, for this price the food should be tasty.

Cheese derived ice cream tasted like cold creamy foot. Forced to seek out out supplemental dessert to cleanse palate elsewhere.

(I had finished the review here giving it two stars on my phone. You need to log in online to complete a review. After checking in with my dining companion the next morning it turns out both of us felt ill following the meal. Not impressed. This is down to one star.)"}
{"text":"Most of the dishes were good, one was outstanding. Wonderful technique however the flavours aren't there. Dessert was an epic fail, and the quality of service did not match the price point. It failed to be gracious or inviting. While it is a casual atmosphere, it does qualify as fine dining and the service did not rise to the the calling.

I've had the good fortune of dining at Per Se a number of times, and while I can see the influences of that famous kitchen in the offerings of Yours Truly it did not match the quality. The dishes were unique and beautifully presented, but it did not provide the flavour bombs we expected.

The dessert and how it was handled was the most disappointing. We had ordered an apple crumble, which contained buckwheat. We are big fans of buckwheat noodles, but buckwheat with apple crumble made for a disgusting flavour clash. The table beside us was just as horrified as we were. While we understand that in trying to be adventures sometimes kitchens miss, it was handled poorly. We mentioned our strong dislike to the waitress, and she said \"Well, you must not like buckwheat.\" Her attitude was most distasteful. She did NOT remove the dish, nor did the kitchen offer a replacement. At other fine dining experiences where we have run into this problem, they would have at least provided a sorbet and the kitchen would have sought further feedback. This lacked professionalism and elegance.

There are many fine dining experiences in Toronto that surpass what we had that night, and we will not be returning. That being said, we do hope they succeed, and they will if they work out the kinks in their service and make more careful selections for the menu."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their tasting menu A LOT. You also have to have their cocktails, definitely one of the best in the city. The bartender will also create  something on the spot for you if you tell him what you like."}
{"text":"HELLO TORONTO!!! I am impressed! I just attended my FIRST Toronto Yelp UYE last night and what a way to kick-start the NEW YEAR with a BANG!  Feeling like a Yelp virgin, all over again, I walked into the venue with my sidekick, Mark T., and met some fabulous Toronto Yelp Elites! As always, super friendly, and loads of fun, THIS is why they are \"Elite\" status! Made me feel like I'd been hanging with them for eons! First of all - a shout out to SUSAN G. and DISHAN W. - THANKS for organizing it! I was all smiles, all night!

Located just at the corner of Dundas St. W & Ossington, this new baby is only a couple of months old! I feel so COOL to be in-the-know! Upon entering, I was immediately impressed by the trendy space, with funky pendent lights hanging amidst the dimly lit interior. Very cozy, and a reasonably quiet atmosphere for an appetizer-slash- drinking spot! 

PLEASE NOTE: This is an American SNACK bar. Dishes are meant to be small tasting dishes, so be prepared to order more than 1 dish to fill up! We were a table of 8, and it was a challenge to determine how to go about ordering food! Dishes ranged from $5 - $30. The average dish was around $6, and you will receive 2-3 small pieces on each dish. As a large group, we opted for ordering 3 of every single item on the menu (minus the $14 lobster roll and $30 steak and eggs dish). It was enough to make all 8 of us feel full without falling into a food coma!

THE HIT LIST:

SALT COD - like a tofu rice baggie, but stuffed with moist steamed rice, mixed with sesame seeds, inari, nori kewpie, and tiny pieces of cod - MY FAVE! 

DEVILED EGGS - soft boiled eggs, topped with nori flakes, sesame, and a hint of hot sauce? Creative! 

PORK SSAM - large bitter lettuce wraps topped with grilled juicy pork & marinated corriander. Simple & Light!

PORK ADOBO - soft tacos with marinated veggies and soft chewy pork meat drizzled with pork fat and oils. Finger-licking goodness! (Oh! Ask for a hand towel in advance - you'll thank me later)

It was like have an innovative/creative party in your mouth all night long! WELCOME BACK INDEED!!!  

Yours Truly is SINCERELY an awesome place to drink & eat & have a gabfest!"}
{"text":"Unique dining experience - I enjoyed everything on the menu but the portions (although setup in several courses) were on the verge of almost being a bit too small. Really enjoyed the unique amuse bouche offered."}
{"text":"One of the best meals ever - and I've eaten here twice!

The best thing about going here with three other people? We ordered everything on the menu! Both the meat and the veg tasting menus, and the snacks! AMAZING!

Service is good, food is even better. Loved it.

This is the kind of place where they elevate the simplest ingredients. Pickled celery can rock your world at Yours Truly."}
{"text":"Lots of hype for this hipster spot - boarding on overrated.  I was not in agreement with Toronto Life at all.  The buzz won't last, but is deffinitely worth checking out.  Prix Fix - pretty pricy with limited choices.  Cocktails were cool, though we sent one back - a bit too creativem, if you know what i mean (a la mixologist)!  Hard to get reservations, but the staff is friendly and we waited across the street for 4 seats at the communal table.  1-2 hours wait is normal I think.  We had 3 separate waiters over our meal - which is always a bit annoying...though all were nice - felt a bit scattered.  Food took forever, which is annoying after waiting for a table and seemed weird given the WHOLE RESTAURANT is eating the same stuff...when it came it was extremely interesting - well executed and delicious...though a bit over contrived - popcorn salad?  really - best thing was the Perogee and the Rice pudding.  We also has a really nice chesse...
Crowd is a young who's who - lots of groups of girls and guys likely heading to the bars after - we saw one hook up at the communal table - kinda funny.  The staff looked like they didn't give a sh*t about what they wore - too hipster for me...

Bill was expensive - likely because of how much wine / beer was ordered while we waited for our food.  Deffinitely not a cheap night out..."}
{"text":"It was good, a little too hyped up for my taste. Some of the dishes had a lot of Japanese influence in them (furikake and inari...). Great value with a 3 course meal."}
{"text":"Very dark and intimate. Service was good. Some cocktail I had with grapefruit was really good. I liked the granville winter ale too. 

Portions are small, had the tasting menu which was 55. Lots of little snacks in between.
Oysters were delicious, so were the deviled eggs even though I have made better. 
Had some kind of root vegetable/grain medley which was surprisingly delicious, since I usually prefer a little umami in my dishes. 
Some el potito truffled egg dish with a crispy potato wafer was amazing and I have been craving this dish since I got back from Spain. 
Chicken breast dish was moist and flavourful but tiny.
Don't remember the rest, but in general the food was solid (not mind-blowing).

Concept is fun, you don't know what you're getting beforehand so my boyfriend and I just decided to use all the ingredients and share whatever we got so we could try everything. Tasting menu is good to try once, but I don't think I'll be back for it because of the portions. Might try their a la carte menu next time. 

Would I return? Possibly, for the a la carte."}
{"text":"Went here with 5 others for my bday dinner. I felt bad because we sat at the communal table and two people from our party were late (like really late...30 min and 1 hour) and it was a Saturday night so it was crazy busy. Normally I'd expect the staff to hate us for this, but they were still nice. The decor is minimal but cozy - they even have the old Galaxy donuts sign downstairs. The food is also really simple but good, made with quality ingredients and done in interesting ways. The only thing I'd say about the tasting menu is that it's not a lot of food. I thought $45 was reasonable for a salad course, two mains, and dessert, but normally that many courses would leave me stuffed. This was just fine for me (my boyfriend said he was still hungry though, so be warned if you normally eat a lot). 

Probably not worth reviewing the actual food we had since the menu changes, but I will say that the trout, whatever they did to it, was amazing. So was the gnocchi. The dessert was cake topped with (allegedly) whipped yogurt (& honey), but honestly it tasted exactly like whipped cream. If it was really yogurt then I'm impressed. My friend who ordered bar snacks had the cook bring them out to her, and he was really cute & explained everything.

Good deal on Steigl and good cocktails. I'd definitely come back, but would recommend making reservations (or show up early for the communal table)."}
{"text":"great food. getting a seat is tough especially for the weekend but worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"I hate myself for doing this, but I can only give this place 3.5 stars based on my visit here last week..... I have said this time and time again, it is the luck of the draw what type of meal you get and what type of snack offerings are available the nite you are there. I frequently check their daily menu, seeing when it will change, what is new etc.... Sigh I'm such a food addict.

Coming on a Monday night for the 9pm dinner service, the place was packed.... And Loud! Our server was courteous and patient with our ever ending questions. Being told that the rare earth cocktail was a pretty solid staple on their menu, I went with that for my drink of the night. Bourbon based, it lived my to my expectations. Booze and very earthy, so to speak.

We were presented with pistachios and longan to start our nite. By fresh and juicy fruit, I was very happy with how things started. Then the amuse Bouches came out, more than I expected to receive. We were given a dashi seaweed broth with seed oil that was flavourful and warmed my lungs, a sushi type roll with carrot and beets, topped with a dollop of spicy mayo... Very in textures with a nice kick to to finish off, and a cheese bread with truffle oil - I thought the puff was dry, With the cheese to be extremely overpowering and lack of truffle essence.

It was quite some time before our first course fame out. It was a potato salad in the form of a round dish, with lots of compliments including different herbs, seeds, pea pur√©e, creme fresh.. The sky was the limit. While I liked the additions that created different flavours and textures, I found the potato salad to be every regular, a little mushy and a little disappointing. It had to get better from here.

Second course was a sea bream with scallions, and snake bean (cool) in a soy based broth. It was beautifully cooked, the fish tasted fresh and overall very refreshing...however...being Asian, it's really hard for me to be completely satisfied when I consistently eat steamed fish at Chinese restaurants and this reminded me of just that. May have been plated and cooked more elegantly but I was hoping for something else here.

Third course was chicken chantecler with crispies on top over potato pur√©e. This was by far the best dish of the night. The chicken was succulent and juicy, flavours just bursting with each bite. I wish there was more mash at the bottom as it was creamy and thinking about this dish makes me salivate. Even after I finished the meal I was longing for more.

Our last courses was the rice pudding with taro, raisins, apple foam and brittle. The foam was refreshing and I like how there were different ingredients to add more flavours and texture. The foam was refreshing and light, while the brittle added a solid crunch with a a bit of saltiness. It was a nice way to end the meal.

I really want to come back to try their snacks menu because it is often changing. I wish I had the chance to meet chef claudio because he follows the same philosophy as chef Blaine at lummi island in Washington and they may have worked together in denmark together.... 

There is always next time.... And yes I will come back.....I will...."}
{"text":"Excellent place. It's deserving a 4.5-5 stars. 

Service was great (it was the girl with the nose piercing).
They have a number of interesting/old school drinks such as \"the Aviation\".
The drinks are nice and strong and the snack menu is great as well.
Loved the cod \"sushi\". 

Ill definitely come back to this place and probably try their pre-fix menu. 

Great place for some food and drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. The setting of the restaurant is warm and cozy.
The plating of the food was very weird... I felt as if my food was randomly placed on a plate.. so I'm not really into the creativity of it.. :(

I ordered the saba - could be better."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I can already tell this is going to be a popular addition to the Dundas and Ossington zone. Especially given the fact the kitchen is open until 2am!

Came later in the night with some friends so we tackled the late-night menu in grand style: by ordering one-of-everything on the menu. I wish I could remember all the items we had because some of them were quite stellar, but because I am a little bit of a slowpoke when it comes to ingredients I don't know what I was tasting half the time. I do remember enjoying some picked radish though, and possibly some duck and tofu snacks?

Only two beers on tap unfortunately: Stiegl (which I'm not a fan of) and Erdinger Dunkle, which is definitely more my steez as I love dark malty beverages. They have a couple more in bottle as well (including Guinness) so you should be set on the beer tip.

I really liked the atmosphere. Just a classic look with perfect lighting, lots of seating and just an overall great vibe. Our waitress was beyond nice and efficient, and the chef even came out with our food directly and told us all about it. But I think that's because he was friends with the people I was rolling with -- I know nothing about cooking so it all went over my head, but sounded great at least.

Will definitely be coming back to this place soon."}
{"text":"God. I love this place so much I feel hesitant about writing a sparkling review about it! I want this place to myself!

I went on a Saturday night around 1030pm with my good friend. The house was almost full (with one table empty, but prepped for a reservation). We got seated at the communal table at the front of the house. We were seated at the corner of the table, so we were able to (almost) face each other and chat. 

I ordered the CRIMSON FLIP ($12) cocktail. It was a warm blend of flavours, perfect for the winter. 

Between my friend and I, we ordered three of the snack items. And goddamn, every single one was fantastic. 

The THUET BREAD WITH WHIPPED DUCK FAT ($5) was so delightful. I mean, everyone knows you can't go wrong with duck fat. Put it on everything and everyone is happy. The crispy fried shallots that garnished the whipped duck fat added a nice flavour as well. 

The SALT COD inari ($6) was also lovely. The wasabi kewpie sauce was delicious. I shamelessly wiped the plate down with my finger and ate it right off of it. Don't expect the cod to be very salty, as a lot of salt fish tend to be. It was a slight taste that I found balanced all of the flavours equally. 

The PORK SSAM ($7). THE PORK SSSSSAM!!! That night, the pork was garnished with a ranch sauce and topped with crispy fried onion. The pork was so fatty and tender, and that slightly tart ranch sauce cut the heaviness of the fat perfectly. Wrapped in lettuce, the snack went down lightly. I could have had a dozen more of those. 

This place is my new favourite west end hang out. You know how the five stars on Yelp means \"as good as it gets?\" Well, that is exactly how I feel about this snack bar. They do it right, man. (They also serve prix fixe meals, but I am really only looking to it for late night snacks and drinks.)

I really liked the atmosphere at Yours Truly. Nice interior decor. I was a big fan of the huuuuge windows at the front of the house. The place felt laid back and non-pretentious. It felt like people were really just out for a nice relaxed evening. I hope it stays that way. BECAUSE I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK. I AM ALREADY PLANNING MY NEXT TRIP."}
{"text":"$150 per person w a glass of wine. Set menu 15-20 courses. I loved the ash crackers. The menu was innovative, every dish had a unique twist. Decor was very restoration hardware like most trendy restos TO. I definitely enjoyed my meal. :)"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Toronto and have been visiting some of the more highly rated restaurants. Thus far, nothing has been overly impressive on the nicer restaurant side. I saw Yours Truly noted in a local magazine and decided to give it a try. The fact that the chef had worked at Noma, Per Se, etc. made me fear overpriced bad service as much as anticipate great food.

My party was seated at the bar, where the bartender served up a mix of familiar cocktails and his own creations. Here are the high points....

1. The four course menu features 12 words. Three words per row. you choose your course based on one word. The rest is a surprise. One row might contain \"chicken\", \"carrot\", and \"corn\", etc. It cost 45$ the night I went. Everything was somewhat surprising and delicious.
2. The service was friendly and attentive. Each course was carefully described as it was presented.
3. The bar featured 10-12 cocktails, each around 12$. Half were classics, while the other half were original to the bar. For 15$, you could let the bartender surprise you with a creation designed to match your course. There was also beer on tap and a reasonable wine list.

Yours Truly is so much more inventive and tasty than many other places in town awarded the same number of stars by reviewers. It is not Alinea, but for 45$ for four courses, it easily stacks up against anyone else in town."}
{"text":"Monday night dinner - it was packed.

My friend had a two or three glasses of scotch. I had a glass of Malbec. They kept forgetting our drinks =(

Carte Blanche that night with the 4 drinks came to about $300

My eyes are bigger than my stomach. Even though majority of the dishes are light, we were pretty full by the time the snack portions were finished. 

There were a few items that just fascinated you but it was more of the presentation and the aroma .. it wasn't the taste, and the the opposit of course. 

When I was talking to another friend about it, he reminded me that the restaurant has the feel of Chateaubriand in Paris. I agreed. Just way to dim in there ... at some point i had a hard time figuring out what i was looking at. Good disguise to hide poor presentation? 

It was delicious. I think I can come here 2x a year ... Kaji ... i feel once a year is enough. Or at least i can come here and order a la carte!

A la carte that evening:
Oysters -  yum!
Geoduck - alright!
Beet - with goat cheese i think, okay
inari - ok
nori - yum, needed more nori to go with their paste
devil'd egg - yum
mussel - double yum
salmon - yay! and we couldn't tell where the food ended and which was just for display
lobster roll - yum but could be so much better
shishito - easy dish not that special, but shishito peppers are one of my favs anywhere
falafel  - special hummus that came with it. .. okay 
potato with seaweed butter? I devoured the butter
freezie - quality grape freezie yum ... if only i were a kid again
bread ... uhmmm nut bread, warm ... was okay, it wasn't one of those warm bread that you want to ask for more ... 
yam - soup ///// getting into the heavy main dishes ... yummy but getting full!!
beet/hamachi - can't remember 
egg - egg, egg foam, truffle  ... i was getting full so i didn't devour the egg yolk when i found it
trout/cauliflower ... you had to have it with the skin because the peanut brittle only went well with that skin on the trout
Chicken/carrot - yum, but we only ate one of two pieces
parsnip ... it was a light sweet dish. It didn't taste like parsnip
pocky - i really wanted more dessert but my stomach knew this was a perfect ending, homemade pocky is all it could fit by then.


It took us 3.5hrs to finish that meal. It was one of those meals you have to have good companion who enjoys food to make it even more enjoyable."}
{"text":"OoooOOOoooo..... I was doing a happy dance all the way down Dundas in anticipation of eating at Yours Truly.  I've made 3 reservations at this hot spot and each time I had to cancel due to extenuating circumstances... Well, not this time!

I giddily sat with my dining companion and looked over the menu, basically a 3x4 matrix of single ingredients; each row representing a course, each column a choice within that course.  There's an air of mystery about this and I like it.  I chose the asparagus salad, the seared trout, the gnocchi in onion broth and the savoury cheese and tomato dessert.  Our amuse bouche of papardums, cool pea soup and a rice and seaweed dumping was surprisingly filling.  Portions were small but not  unreasonably so.  Everything was beautifully plated, seasoned perfectly and all the serving staff were friendly and enthusiastic about the food.  

Wine and cocktail lists looked divine but I opted for a pint of Stiegel.  Our four course dinner ($45) dinner lasted  a leisurely two hours... I was stuffed, maybe it was the beer?  Anyway, the ten course meal ($85) was ever so tempting but I really think it's something one would want to embark upon during the 6pm and not 9pm seating... 

The menu always changes so going back will always offer something new and exciting.  A+ gang!"}
{"text":"Horrendous experience. Arrived for an 8:30 pm reservation with five other diners and we did not end up leaving until 11:30. Several drink orders and our dessert were forgotten by our server (woman with thick Scottish accent). After waiting half an hour for my second drink which I had ordered from the manager, I joked to our server that perhaps I should order my third drink from her now, so that when I finally do end up receiving and finishing my second drink, I won't have to wait so long for the next one. She snapped at me, telling me that what I said had been incredibly insulting, and walked off without taking any other orders . Everyone was absolutely shocked. She returned 10 minutes later with my drink and apologized for the wait. Apparently the manager had forgotten to submit my drink order. I received no apology for the attitude that I had received earlier, however. 

The server told us it was the last night for the tasting menu and that in future the menu would be a la carte. When asked her opinion on the different menu options, she said she hadn't tried any of them because they were new and wouldn't be of much help. Ok. When food finally started coming out at 9:15 we were starving. The portions were small, which is expected of this style of menu, and the food was only average at best. The other diners and I all agreed that the albacore tuna (first course) was the best of the evening, as it was a very interesting and balanced dish. The wait time in between courses was unbearably long. We ended up paying the bill in between the fourth course and dessert so that we could leave directly after we finished eating. Then we waited. And waited. after half an hour of sitting there waiting for dessert, we were finally able to catch the attention of the server who looked surprised to see us still sitting there. When asked about dessert she replied \"oh, I must have forgotten to put the order in when you paid the bill\". Then she wandered off and dessert (some small chocolate cube with the consistency of jello) arrived 10 minutes later. 

The service at this restaurant is abysmal. In terms of both service and food, I expect a lot more at this price point. I will not be returning and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone who values their time and/or money."}
{"text":"I won't go on and on about the specificities of my meal, but I will say that the food was very good, if a little eggy. 

I was disappointed to see that they had moved away from the special, separate vegetarian menu (a-la-woodlot) and just put everything on one card. It was fine, but it left me having to ask the server to point out everything that was vegetarian which would be impossible to figure out on my own otherwise since most of the items are just one word (such as \"egg\" or \"terroir\"). 

The atmosphere could have used a bit more polishing. The design seemed a little too DIY for the kind of place that it is. Perhaps it's not fair to compare to URSA who charges possibly double, but the kind of food they serve deserves a similar setting. 

I was there with someone who doesn't eat eggs or meat. It's difficult to eat from their menu if you don't eat eggs or meat, so the kitchen made an exception and brought out both vegetarian entrees instead of an egg app/entree.

I would say that if you go to all the new Toronto restaurants, then this place is worth a try. If you're here for a few nights, there are more interesting places to visit."}
{"text":"Wow.  Just... wow.  If you're in Toronto right now, get your butt to Yours Truly.

Then order an East End.  I'm one of the pickiest people when it comes to cocktails.  I hate sweet, girly drinks.  This knockout was the most delightful, nuanced mix of vodka, mint and cilantro.  Love, love, love!  In the top three best drinks of my life.

Then I had the Carte Blanche tasting menu.  One of the top three meals of my life.

No freaking clue what people are talking about with regards to the pricing and the portions here.  Yeah, yeah, I come from San Francisco where we pay an arm and a leg for everything but our dry cleaning and mani/pedis.  However, hear me out here.  The meal I had at Yours Truly consisted of give or take 20 courses, lasted over three hours, and I was completely stuffed at the end.  And the food was amazing.  And it's only $99 per person.

I ate at some of the other fancy, tasting menu places in Toronto.  This place not only has, hands down, the best food, but it is the best value too!

Not to mention, you can wear JEANS!  Come on, people!  It doesn't get any better than this!

Food:

I can't remember everything I ate.  I'm listing the best things below.  But I loved every bite that went in my mouth.

Potato daikon soup - hot, shot glass, pureed potato, good Asian fusion thing going on.

Trio of oyster, peas with cream fraiche, saba (mackerel) - light, tasty, continued the Asian fusion theme.

Garlic knots - holy heck, it was all I could do to stop eating this buttery, pretzel-like concoction.  But I knew that I couldn't waste too much room on bread products.  I wish I could have them send me some of these so I could pop one in the oven at dinner time.

There was another trio, it had the most amazing salmon tartare with cream fraiche on it, also had squid ink chips, and soba noodle soup.  It was all delicious.

Duck on cream puff bread - imagine a cream puff.  Then imagine the cream is replaced by melt in your mouth duck.  Then imagine that it's cute and mini and you can pop it your mouth in one bite.

There was a radish dish - all sorts of preparations.  Also good.

Little chicken drumsticks... eating with your fingers!  They were so good I wanted a few more.

One of the main entrees was duck breast.  I don't even like duck.  But I LOVED this dish.  And I was pretty full at this point, so that's saying a lot.

The finish was strong.  There was a crazy panna cotta with currants and oats (again, I don't normally like panna cotta but this was amazing).  Then there was a mango ice cream / salad dessert (I saw it as a take on a thai papaya salad) and it was such a pleasant mix of flavors and textures.  I loved the red jalapenos in the dish - they really set it off.  And when I thought I was going to have a \"dinner mint\" moment, they brought out the cutest little merengues and truffles. An excellent end to the meal.

I'm going to say it again - I like every bite I took.

What the heck are you waiting for?  Get yourself to Yours Truly!"}
{"text":"Good food but tiny portions.
To add to the evening, I chipped a tooth on an over glazed cherry that was hard as rock. Don't bother with the place."}
{"text":"Boyfriend took me here on a date and I was so impressed with his decision! Right along the Ossington Strip, lots of good restaurants around and places for drinks afterwards.

We got the prix fixe option - 4 courses with around another 4 complementary dishes. They go to the market everyday and pick the ingredients fresh to make their menu's. The server was extremely helpful - I don't eat meat but I love fish, but I'm allergic to shellfish (pescetarian allergic to shellfish) :( Make sure you tell your server of any dietary restrictions, they can offer alternative dishes that are just as tasty!

The dishes were small but so fun and creative! Super tasty too. They came out every 5-10 minutes so that gave you time to fill up a little before getting the next dish. We walked out full but also had drinks which helped fill us up I guess.

I wish I remembered everything we got but that alchy didn't help me with trying to memorize the dishes - the cocktails are strongggg! 

Definitely recommend for a splurge date :)"}
{"text":"Extremely small portions and poor wine list makes Yours Truly just an average restaurant. Although somewhat creative, the dishes were not overly engaging and lacked presence. Also, I am increasingly disappointed with how small tapas portions have become. The economics to the restaurant must be so favorable at this point, but at what expense to the dining experience? The wine list was OK, but you could have done as well ordering wine by the glass. The best dish was the brisket, but be prepared for just a three inch piece (yes, just one piece!). 

Sorry, not the greatest experience.

Good luck!"}
{"text":"Glad I went, but won't be rushing back.

Yours Truly gets an \"A\" for effort but I'd grade the execution at more of a \"B-\".

I dined at Yours Truly with a group of four girl friends on a Friday night. We didn't go overboard on drinks but had cocktails to start ($15 each, and very tasty) and then replenished with another round about mid-way through our meal. The four of us chose to have the 4-course menu ($55) in which the guest is to choose one of two nightly options for each course. This night the choices were:

Course 1: carrot or beef
Course 2: egg or grouper
Course 3: mushroom or chicken
Course 4: chocolate or cheese

I had: beef, grouper, chicken and chocolate, but of my friends, a couple chose the carrot, egg and mushroom.

The meal began with a \"complimentary\" amuse-bouche of oysters and charred mackerel (my most-hated fish) with a fruity, textured sauce, and garlic bread knots. In between the 2nd and 3rd courses, we were served Sriracha deviled-eggs (blah) and smoked trout cheese puff-kinda things (I can't remember what they were called but they were delicious). 

In general, the food was OK, but nothing to rush back for. My friend did not enjoy the smoked carrot she was served and the beef tartar appetizer was average.The grouper served on a bed of spatzle was rather salty (probably because of the black olive oil used), the chicken was very bland and my friends didn't have much to say about the egg or mushroom dishes. We all selected the chocolate desert option which was very good but nothing outstanding.

I do like the concept and the idea that every dish is unexpected, but the flavour combinations and seasonings just did not impress me.I Maybe the emphasis was on pairing textures, which I did notice and enjoy.  All-in-all, I was a little disappointed after hearing so much about this place.

The service was OK. Although we had a number of different staff bringing dishes to our table, our main server who took our orders and performed quality-checks, was unenthusiastic and after bringing out first round of drinks to the table said in a very blaze tone,  \"So have you guys been here before?\" When answered, \"no\" she replied, \"Well then I guess I should tell you how this is gonna go.\" Anyway, we were only subjected to her lifeless and insipid service for a couple of hours. She did manage a smile when performing the final quality-check but I noticed it quickly disappear as she turned around. I privately noted her attitude early on but didn't say anything until one of my friend's made a comment to which we all agreed.  Anyway, I suspect that having to explain every dish repetitively throughout the night to a number of tables gets tiresome, so perhaps she'd be better-suited to a job at Applebee's. That said, the other staff who brought dishes to our table throughout the night were pleasant. 

Anyway, I don't think any of us will be dreaming about our meal at Yours Truly or too excited to return any time soon.  The food was very pretty and presented nicely but the flavours were just not there. The portion sizes were small-ish but the meal is paced well so it ended-up being just-right and you won't leave too full or too hungry after the 4 courses. The service was just average, at best.

Our meal was an even $400 for the four of us (4x the 4-course menu, 5 cocktails, a glass of beer and a glass of wine), and included tax and just short of a 16% tip. I know that 20% is somewhat considered the new standard but Yours Truly didn't really go out of their way to make us feel too welcome and the main server was pretty disinterested so I was comfortable with leaving a basic amount.

I don't think this restaurant is a write-off and am sure (and have heard and read) of people loving it just wasn't there for me. It's fun to be unaware of what you'll be served it's just too bad I didn't find it very innovative or flavourful.

My advice is \"don't believe the hype\" and perhaps go with lowered expectations."}
{"text":"went here for dinner on a chilly winter night when most other restaurants in town were closed for family day holiday. The place has a cosy vibe and can get very loud. We were seated at a corner table as requested in our reservation. The best part was that there was no printed menu, eh! To make things simple, they only offered 2 choices - meat and vegetarian. For the slightly more ambitious they have a carte blanche menu (20 courses) and a 3 hour extravaganza :) We wanted to taste all their offerings so ended up ordering both the menus. How many restaurants offer not one but 4 or 5 different amuses before dinner? I also ordered a bourbon cocktail that hit the right notes on the alcohol level.. The food is presented beautifully with foams, creams, powders, the dehydrated and the crisped and the entire works.The snacks added to the party in the mouth. The menu is seasonal and our server informed us that in the summer they offer 3 variations. I am definitely excited to go back and try this out in a few months... I have immense respect for chefs who are ambitious and stretch the limits of creativity. I don't remember what our salad course was comprised of but all the flavors worked like a charm and harmonized all the textures on the plate.  The only disappointing course was the carrot dish with saag, it was quite boring and did not speak to us. Overall, our service was top notch and unpretentious. I definitely recommend this place to all the foodies out there, go for it !!!"}
{"text":"4 for food and plus one for service and experience.

Got a same day reservation to host a birthday/holiday treat meal.  Online reservation service was easy to use.

We arrived with a large case in tow and the service started well with an offer to lock up the case in the basement.  Everything stayed smooth the rest of the evening.  Other reviewers have pointed out well enough how the restaurant works.  Let me add that different staff, including from the kitchen, often had a real sense of joy about them as they introduced each plate and responded to the oohs and ahs.

Foodwise from the 4-course menus, some major hits, a couple dishes that were good but not my all time faves, but overall one of the very best meals I've had as a vegetarian.  3 of 4 of us didn't eat meat and \"best meal I've ever had\" was one of the comments.  

Highlights included a poached egg under potato foam with crispy shallots and a course of autumn flavours with a lot of great sauces and emulsions.  Desserts were all great including a wonderfull buttermilk custard.  The only dish that didn't blow me away was a spelt pasta with hand foraged mushrooms (I'd give it a 3 so not bad food) which probably needed some salt or acid to jump it up.  My gf ordered halibut and was told the supplier thought it was the best fish in Toronto that day, and she was pleased so we'll trust the restaurant that they stand by what the serve.

The atmosphere was a little loud.  My knowlegable companion was highly complimentary of the music.  Someone was always jumping in to pour wine and water.  Overall though after months of waiting to go and as far as treating two other vegetarians, I was more than pleased and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went to Yours Truly for dinner one night while visiting Toronto, and overall I would say that while the restaurant has a unique way of has a new way of preparing its menu, but the portion sizes are too small to justify the price. 

We heard a lot of buzz regarding this restaurant, and with it being new, we wanted to check it out during our visit.  The menu is a set of eight ingredients, which are divided into two ingredients for four courses. Since there were two of us, we decided to just split them up and get all eight different dishes. Some of the dishes were inventive, like the carrot two ways, which was a new twist on carrots. (I think was the first time I have like a carrot-only dish.) But some of the dishes, whileI could see what they are trying to do, they plated it very oddly. The meat dish was basically some type of beef tartare over sushi rice with huge lotus leaves on top, ...on a plate that was five times bigger than it needed to be, resulting in the dish seeming too small. 

Luckily, we didn't come to Yours Truly hungry, because we probably would have left hungry even after their four-course meal. The size of the courses more portended to a 10-course meal and not a four-course meal, in my opinion.

The service was nothing special. Our waitress was kind of in and out, and somewhat condescending when we were talking about the dishes. I did like that the kitchen staff brought out their own creations, but I understand that in a busy restaurant, that's not always possible with every dish. It also took quite a while for us to get our cocktails, and while I asusme that the bar must be slammed during dinner, that's just a failure of management if you don't know how many bartenders should have for a full restaurant. (I hate when servers and bartenders use that a bar is \"busy\" as an excuse for slow service, because it's not our fault for coming when you have open reservations.)

Overall, I don't think I would recommend Yours Truly, mostly because there are so many quaint and charming restaurants up and down Ossington Avenue, the competition is rough.  Plus, the Toronto food scene is really good, so I definitely think that this restaurant is relying more on buzz and the style of its menu than providing an actually filling prix-fixe option."}
{"text":"4.8 stars 
-.2 points for our bartender. She was a bit off. 

What I love about this place is that it's a mix of a bar, a restaurant and a casual place to get a snack. It just ...works. The tasting menu is highly underrated. 

APPETIZERS 
We waited for 40 minutes for our table but the wait on a Friday night was worth it! 
We split a tasting menu for one and some appetizers and were fully satiated. 
What a cool touch that the cooks come out to serve you your food. Pretty cool stuff. 

The deviled eggs were pretty solid but not my all time favourite. I think they were also shadowed by other appetizers. Mainly the Salt Cod. OMG. Hot Damn. The saltiness on the fish and rice was perfect! 

TASTING MENU 

WINE: Tempranillo from Valencia. A great red that went down really really smooth. Lovely tannins and tastes. Not too sweet but sweet enough! Perfect with the duck. Yum Yum Yum. 

They all were a progressions of tastes. The standout was the duck.

Parsnip - I've never had parsnip (or I don't remember it); it's like carrot with a crunchy texture; the whipped honey was the star of this dish and it was light and fresh. 

Trout - perfectly cooked; my dining companion loved it. So I let him eat the rest of the dish! Paired with hazelnuts, cranberry and yam. Again loving the flavours and textures. For one person, this is a very good portion. There was some bok choy on the side and it was delicious. 

Duck - I LOVE LOVE LOVED this dish. I could have had another one to be honest! The duck was moist, juicy and full of flavour paired with sunchoke and garlic emulsion. 

Yogurt was a unique spin on a dessert that was healthy for you. It was tart and a bit sour. The anise was the coating on top of the jar that you crack through with your spoon and again, gives the dessert a great texture like a creme brulee. The raspberry flavour of the hisbiscus was spot-on. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Really really happy I had the tasting menu. The chefs really know what they're doing and I love that they're doing it in a casual atmosphere. It's like this really great secret. A great date place. 
It's not cheap though: the meal with wine came out to $120 for two."}
{"text":"Excellent service, mostly great food . I loved their gnocchi with sorrel, hazelnut and mushrooms! Also their poached egg with onion, garlic, chickweed and ash....who knew, a poached egg can be this delicious?!  I liked this place a lot, and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've been here once before only for cocktails but I came back to try the food. It was absolutely delicious! The 4 course tasting menu was about $45.  They have an extensive cocktail list but the best part is telling the bartender the kind of stuff you like and then having him or her make it for you. I mentioned I liked bourbon and dark liquors and he made something super amazing that wasn't on the menu. They call it \"Dealer's Choice\" on the menu. The drinks here are amazing and there's something for everyone. 

The food was amazing. There were 4 courses but every now and then there was an amuse bouche or a snack of some sort. So many snacks, at one point I said \"I don't think we ordered this\" but he assured us it came with our food order. Ok, fine by me! The food was delicious and perfect in every way. It was the right amount of food for us. We ordered different options and split it all. 

Our bartender was very knowledgeable about the fancy liquor they had. I learned some things about different types of rare alcohols, which is very rare at many places. 

I love the decor. The wood, wrought iron, copper, metals, perfectly dimmed lighting... Everything looked awesome. When I'm rich and have a loft-style apartment, I want all my exposed wood and metal to look similar to this place. 

I highly recommend this place. Customer service at the bar is top notch. The food is amazingly delicious. The drinks are spectacular. Everything about this place was perfect. Do it, you won't regret it. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"[Yours] Truly, I'm in LOVE. 

I love this place! 

I visited on a Wednesday with fellow Yelpers to try out their \"small plate\" menu specifically, as I'm a huge fan of tapas, and have heard amazing things. Their menu had a great variety - including two tapas items, steak and eggs ($30) and lobster rolls ($14) which we decided to skip because of price, we ordered two of everything else in the $5-$7 range. 

The best were:

- Deviled Eggs: I've never had them before, and I'm pretty sure that nothing else could ever compare EVER. I couldn't shut up about the eggs. They were a dream in my mouth! 

- Toast w/ Duck Fat: While that definitely wasn't the actual name of the dish, that just about sums it up. After experiencing this, I wouldn't hesitate to spread fat on my toast in the future (ok, maybe I would)

- Pork Adobo Tacos: So good we ended up ordering 4 plates. AH-MAZING

- Pork Lettuce Wraps: Charred perfection, SO delicious! 

There were about 4 other dishes, but these were by far my favorites. 

They also have a variety of interesting unique cocktails in the $10 - $14 range. 

It wasn't just the food and drinks that made me love this place though - the service was really great, our waitress was extremely friendly, prompt and informative. Also, the decor is perfect - even the washrooms were so nicely designed, and everything was clean and modern, yet almost rustic. The \"tin\" light fixtures and exposed light bulbs over the bar definitely were right up my alley. 

I WILL SO BE BACK ASAP. 

Yours Truly,

{"text":"Definitely worth the visit, but we won't be returning soon. 

On the plus side, where else can you get a 20ish course meal?  

On the minus side, unfortunately the service was a bit rushed, the dishes not well explained and to be honest, unless you're a foodie that loves odd combinations, too weird."}
{"text":"I like the idea. It was quite interesting to pick the theme of the dishes and not knowing what to get until they served it.

Nice atmosphere, really casual and cozy.

Honestly would give it a 2.5 but won't be too much of a bummer and let people decide on their own. There isn't much to pick from in terms of the set meals. A or B and B needed to have made reservations ahead (not that I would pay 85 unless I knew what I was getting).

Anyways the concept was nice. They gave us a complementary starter meal which gave the meal off to a good start as I found it quite interesting with their cold soup, deviled egg and a salmon on a cracker thing?

I picked asparagus, bream, chicken, and spruce. Trying to be more adventurous.

After the good start the asparagus was really nothing special. Grilled asparagus with , from what I remember, milk and olive oil? was really light but honestly nothing special and sub par for a tasting menu like meal.

My favorite was the next dish the sea bream. First time having bream and it was a nice textured fish. With the skin. Only thing I wish was it wasn't as small as it was. 

After that was the something chicken. Was pretty good but again really small. 

The dessert was a nice sherbert with merguine peice I believe. Looks really nice and tasted pretty good to finish the meal off.

Only main problems was the portions and the lack of choices other than the set \"choose your own\" theme 4 course meal. I guess that is the specialty but I would suggest at least having another small menu to choose from for others?

Actually if I picked the beef for the first incredient I think I would have given it a 4 :)"}
{"text":"You don't dine at Yours Truly, you experience it. This was one of the most interesting meals I've ever had. My suggestion? Get the tasting menu with the assorted wine. Tell the wait staff if you have any allergies or foods that you don't eat. Use the information they give you make your selection and then don't ask anymore questions. Let the meal surprise you."}
{"text":"Yours Truly is a great new addition to the ossington strip. Formerly a Galaxy Donuts, they have transformed it into an uber cool and modern space with faux wood walls, copper light fixtures and edison light bulbs. The old Galaxy Donuts sign can be found in the basement on the way to the bathroom - a cute touch, indeed. The menu is something different for Ossington, and the city of Toronto in general.

The food is sourced from the best local resources (Kolapore Springs, Montforte Cheeses Cumbraes...etc) and is creative, playful and fun semi-asian-semi-molecular gastronomy at a fantastic price point.  Our group of six tried everything on the snacks menu and was happy with each course. Highlights included the outrageously delicious pickled celery, radish and green beans as well as the xi'an lamb skewer with housemade flatbread. The atmosphere is relaxed, the prices reasonable for downtown, and the kitchen doesn't close until 2am - what more could one ask for?"}
{"text":"Important notes:
- services is fantastic
- small plates are no longer: only a price fixed menu of $45 per person that includes a couple of courses."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for her birthday tonight and I would say the overall experience was ok. We had a great waitress and she was fantastic throughout the night.

As for the food.... I would confidently tell everyone the food is a solid 7 out of 10.  However, its good if you are not hungry.  The portion sizes are creative.  Everyone that has posted great reviews obviously doesn't eat much because we were so hungry after dinner that we went two doors down for some real food.  
I get the feeling that there are great chef's behind this place and a suit holding them back.  

Toronto Life rated this place number 1.  I have concern around  how restaurants are rated as this is definitely NOT number 1 in Toronto.  
I have wondered about the credibility of Toronto life since it rated pho restaurants and didn't mention Pho Linh.  That place is lined up all day.  They are obviously out of the loop.  

I would say the wine was fantastic, we had 3 Girls.  

Too much hype and too little food...This place will not last if the portion sizes remain.  Honestly there are so many great restaurants in this city.  

Great place if you plan on losing weight and want to spend money and act cool.  Also if you wear a plaid dinner jacket."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Their dishes are ambitious and delicious with an infusion of molecular gastronomy, but their pacing and portioning needs work.

Let's this out of the way: I'm a huge fan of YT - their food, cocktails (try the AMPERSAND or the ELDERBERRY FIZZ), service and vibe are all top notch. They stand out as original and fun, and really ups the standard of the Toronto resto landscape. 

This review is for the 4-course Prix Fixe and 19-course Carte Blanche (requires reservation and you're limited to a table of 4 or less). Both tasting menus end up feeding you way more when you include the amuse bouches. :)

Because YT's menu frequently changes, I won't focus on specific dishes. Suffice to say, their ingredients are fresh and thematic, and the presentation is fantastic. Some of their dishes delve into a bit of molecular gastronomy with their use of foams and liquid nitrogen.  The pictures section does a great job showcasing what these guys can do. One knock, however, is that the menu is, at times, too much of an \"experiment in motion\"; that is, some of their dishes appear more as \"drafts\" rather than fully realized creations.

PRIX FIXE $45
Personally, I was very satisfied and full with their offerings but I've heard mixed reviews from friends who have attended - some had similarly great experiences, while others had to go grab something else afterwards.

CARTE BLANCHE $95
At nearly 4 times the amount of food at just twice the price, the Carte Blanche is something truly special to treat yourself to. The pacing and portioning, however, could really use some work. Me and my DC's ended up sitting for 5 hours for their Carte Blanche, which is way too long, not to mention fatiguing. We arrived on time but the food didn't come out until an hour later. There were lulls between certain dishes. And finally, I actually think there was TOO MUCH food - I was uncomfortably full afterwards. This is in contrast to the tasting menus at Sushi Kaji, Ruby Watchco and even the 25-course Momofuku Ko lunch which I've comfortably completed in less than 2.5 hours. Given that their Carte Blanche is a relatively recent offering, I'm hopeful they'll sort it out.

All in all, despite these issues, I really love what YT is doing. I would come here for a bite, a drink, or to gorge myself. Stay hungry my friends."}
{"text":"Yours Truly is reputed for two different tasting menus: the once-nightly 20-25 course Carte Blanche option at a $99 price point, and a smaller four-course offering for $55.  We made our reservation just a day in advance, and thus couldn't secure a booking for the Carte Blanche.  

When we arrived we perused the four-course tasting menu, which consists of a choice between two options - one vegetarian and one omnivorous - for each course, each named solely for their key ingredient.  Those options were: Celery/Scallops, Beets/Sturgeon, Fall/Chicken, and Pear/Apple.  

Intrigued, and wondering what one would do with celery that would tempt a diner to trade scallops to find out, we were offered an additional option: a $75 tasting menu with \"a few more courses,\" served Carte Blanche style in which the kitchen team would serve us whatever they felt like creating that evening.  At $55 for four courses, we figured the $75 option would be six, maybe seven courses.

And oh god were we wrong.  Oh... oh god.

What proceeded to emanate from the kitchen was an unrelenting litany of sixteen courses, ranging from small bites and intermezzos to mid-sized mains.  We were served six of the four-course tasting menu items, including the mysterious Celery, but also a number of items that escaped mention on the menu.  Everything we ate was creative, most of it was wonderful, and in the rare couple of instances where something was simplistic and unexciting it was followed with something brilliant anyways.  The value was spectacular, and the level of range and breadth on display was remarkable.  To the best of our recollection here's what we had, in approximate order:

-Dashi Stock Potato Shooter
-Malpeque Oyster with Horseradish Veil
-Octopus
-Salmon Crudo
-Garlic Knots
-Celery and Black Olive Mousse
-Beef Grugere
-Compressed Spinach with Puffed Grains
-Stuffed Tokyo Turnip
-Korean Rice Cakes
-Scallop with Shellfish Congee
-Roasted Beets with Potato Vinaigrette 
-Roasted Sturgeon with Almond Foam and Lemon
-Gooseberry Ginger Freezie Intermezzo
-Roast Chicken with White Bean
-Moon Apple Sorbet

The Celery and Black Olive Mousse was the first tremendous standout.  A small cube of gelatinous celery-flavored mousse, topped with a layer of black olive mousse, it was served in a little pond of celery water and what appeared to be black olive oil.  Surrounding the pond was freeze-dried black olive \"dirt\" of a fashion that would be familiar to veterans of Bar Chef, and small pieces of compressed, highly flavorful celery leaves garnishing the dish.  Shattered and sprinkled over everything were shards of celery brittle, a thin pane of candy glass with a vibrant celery bite. This dish was like nothing I've ever tasted.  Brilliant.

The Roast Chicken with White Bean came in two components, one a perfectly poached loin and the other a cut of shoulder, which appeared to have been de-boned, de-skinned, formed into a cylinder, and then re-wrapped in skin before being broiled.  The latter was like eating a piece of chicken that doesn't actually exist, it was so convincing in its assembly.  \"Leg or breast?\" someone would ask you.  And you'd reply, \"I'll have the cylinder, please.\"  That.  Both pieces were delicious and contrasted in flavor, pairing well with the white bean.

The garlic knots were tasty.  The beef grugere was a single-bite standout.  The compressed spinach was explosive in its intensity, and the scallop with shellfish congee melted in the mouth.  The intermezzo Gooseberry Ginger freezies were remarkably simple, but functionally pleasant, and presented in a giant bowl filled with dry ice, and a frozen puck of water studded with fistfuls of hibiscus and wildflowers.  It was, as the staff described it, \"The most remarkable presentation of anything tonight for the simplest item on the menu.\"  This is culinary whimsy done right.

The only real miss was the tiny Stuffed Tokyo Turnip, which drew a general response, of \"Yup.  Yup that's a turnip.  In my mouth.  Swallowing it now.\"  Unremarkable, but at least enjoyable in its presentation.  Everything else was enlightening and elevating.

I'm not in any rush to return to Yours Truly, nor was there anything I ate that I felt I simply must eat again.  I think that would fly in the face of the intent, really.  This place is about discovery, invention, and incredible execution, and while I usually shy away from the cliche of referring to anything as \"an experience\" as far as food goes, that's what this is.  To go back and eat the same thing again would be a waste of opportunity.  You kick back for a couple hours and just plunge into this world where you have no idea what's going to happen, but trust that everything will work out to be not just delicious, but remarkable, playful, and thought provoking. And in return the team delivers on their sterling reputation.  

Dining here is a true culinary adventure, and Yours Truly stands apart as one of Toronto's most unique and brilliant restaurants."}
{"text":"An overall solid experience that lived up to the hype--the bf and I shared the salmon sashimi and the salt cod to start.  Both were great, but the sashimi really stood out.  We shared the vegetarian tasting menu, which featured a lot of really interesting combinations and preparation methods of which I can't do justice by attempting to describe properly.  It was a very creative menu that also included a few amuse bouches--a cute and very tasty truffle falafel was among them.  

Presentation was also delightful; the falafels came in a jar of rice and other diners at our table received dishes packaged in brown paper bags.  The whole meal really reflected an artful approach to vegetarian food.

Outside of that, the service was great despite it being busy, the ambience found that sweet spot between casual and gourmet-y, and when the bill is squared up, you're just a hop away from Sauceington Row to fulfill your imbibing needs :D."}
{"text":"Terribly overrated. I'm convinced the only people who think this place is exceptional are either a) lucky or b) not well-traveled. Only 4-5 of the 20-odd courses we ate were excellent and another 4-5 were downright terrible. I can't remember eating somewhere that put out a tasting menu where a quarter of it was almost inedible (a dry falafel dish; burnt, bitter mushrooms, etc...). The rest were pretty average. Focus seemed to be more on presentation than taste -- lots of dishes simply didn't work. Ambition was high but execution was poor.

Service was okay. Pacing was awful -- on more than a few occasions, 2 or even 3 dishes came within a matter of minutes.

Cocktails were pretty good. Wine list was spotty (almost nothing in the $90-150/bottle range) and the staff wasn't very helpful with suggestions.

At $100/head for the Carte Blanche, Yours Truly is terribly overpriced for the quality. I'd rather spend $50 more and get a great meal somewhere like Momofuku, Splendido or George. Or spend $50 less and get an equally great meal at Edulis or Black Hoof.

I'm glad I came and I probably won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Gotta jack up the star power after my second visit here. A night at Yours Truly really is as good as it gets. I attended a UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) helmed by yelper Susan G and it was a heckuva night. Great drinks, amazing convivial atmosphere and unforgettable eats.

We ended up getting two of almost everything on the sharing menu (avoiding the higher priced items). These dishes come three to four items on a plate and were between $5 to $7 each. Highlights for me:

Pork Ssam - The extra S is for \"sofreakinggood\". These are lettuce wraps of charred pork belly and crispy onion. As a Hater of Lettuce, it's rare to hear me rave about anything related to the Green Devil.

Salt Cod Inari - Served with creamy wasabi sauce. More sweet than salty, it was an interesting mix of flavours.

Pork Adobo Tacos - just order these.

Bread with whipped duck fat - I shouldn't have to explain this further. 

There were other great options too (actually there wasn't anything I ate that I didn't like) but these were the standouts for me. I also tried two more cocktails on this visit. The Winter Batida is a nice and light gin-based beverage served with a slice of dragonfruit. The Crimson Flip was the ultimate winter drink. Sherry and frangelico heavy with cream, cloves and egg. I had two of these before I started to pass out, sated and happy.

So much fun. And confidential to the servers: I shall return, candy in hand."}
{"text":"What to get:
Egg
Rice

The concept of this restaurant is to choose your main ingredient off the list for each course. There is no menu besides that and the cocktail menu. The idea is fresh and very fun to try out. The food was good to decent depending on the course. My favorites were the egg and rice. There are also snacks and appetizers that come in between courses. The service here is amazing. The server was attentive and friendly. To top of our experience, we saw Peter Gallagher. My girlfriend and I were in awe to even say anything."}
{"text":"pros: really nice ambiance, the place has a cool feel. great lighting. service was friendly. good drinks.

cons: small menu, overpriced, food was nothing special - kind of a waste of time. 

overall i think this place is SO over hyped. there's less than 20 things on the menu in kind of an asian fusion type style. the items are small (YES, V SMALL) and meant to be shared. when ordering i asked the waitress about the ramen noodles everyone was slurping, when i asked if they were made in house, she said no, they were from a package. sorry, i'm not paying $15 for instant ramen.
on her recc, we had sashami (6 small pieces, nothing special), pork shouldar (kind of like pulled pork, served cold, with a bowl of rice).  we had another app, i can't remember what it was. anyways, it was obv  unremarkable. after we paid, we went to libretto for some real food. 
in summary, Too expensive for the size and quality of food."}
{"text":"I've always been impressed by the creativity in the dishes at Yours Truly. Prices are a bit steep but the culinary experience is memorable."}
{"text":"We were the first customer there on a Saturday evening. The first thing that we noticed is the minimalist yet modern and cool decors. Very good music but it wasn't too loud. The atmosphere was trendy and chic.
The menu is simple, and it's always evolving. There are two daily four-course prix fixe menu ($45 for meat, $35 for vegetarian) and a snack menu ($5 - 13) to sop up the cocktails.
Chef Claudio sends out a few amuse-bouche including Creamy Cauliflower Soup, Truffle-infused Falafel Balls with Yogurt and Spinach Leafs topped with whipped buttermilk, salt and rye breadcrumbs! 
Love love love the Truffle-infused Falafal Balls! And I also adore the way it's presented; to have them come out in a tight seal jar that's filled with rice made them so much more enticing. The amazing aroma just fills your nostril the moment the lid is opened. I can have 10 more of these!
A lot of the snacks were Asian-inspired. Thumbs up to chef Claudio for successfully adding twists to the familiar comfort food that we grew up with. Each dish is a fun discovery. Being vegetarian, I especially appreciate the Veg tasting menu that they offer.
Over all, we love the decor, the vibe and the creativity of the dishes. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Not only do the chefs cook in the kitchen, they also bus the tables. They bring out the dishes and introduce them to the customers, acting as \"ambassadors and translators between the kitchen and dining room.\" (Toronto.com) However, the service was extremely slow, there was at least 20 minutes wait between each course. I definitely feel that's something they have to work on immediately."}
{"text":"The portions are small, the price is steep but the quality and originality of the food and the presentation is spectacular. Its matched with a warm, intimate atmosphere.

I thoroughly enjoyed every item on the tasting menu on the two occasions I've been.  The lesser priced ($35) 4 course option was sufficient.  I wouldn't feel the need to pay the premium for 5 courses.   They do allow you to pick an item or two off the tasting menu to accompany drinks if you are not having the full meal."}
{"text":"I called on a Tuesday for a Friday night reservation and I was told that they were fully booked.  I was so excited when the restaurant called me on Friday to tell me that a space had opened up for us.

And so we showed up for our 9pm reservation.  The restaurant had a very...San Francisco or West LA feel to it (sexy and organic hipster).  Since there aren't many choices to be made, we ordered right away.  The bf got the Meat menu and I tried the Veg menu. Honestly, the Veg is a much better deal - two of the four courses are the same for both menus and the Veg still included egg.

We started with the Deviled Eggs, which were creamy and fabulous.  Next, we got a amuse that was ok.  I definitely thought that the food was 4.5* (or maybe even 5* if you factor in creativity).

Yours Truly is the type of place to go if you have two to three hours to spare so you can eat at a leisurely pace. Unfortunately, we wanted to get out of there quickly so we could go to a club.  We asked the waitress if they could speed up the meal a bit (20 min gaps between each item was getting to me) and although she asked the kitchen, there was no improvement. We contemplated abandoning the meal after the 2nd course because we had already been there 80 minutes at that point despite ordering the minute we sat down. At the very end, we got the 3rd and 4th courses and paid almost simultaneously and darted out as fast as we could. We left so quickly that I dropped my scarf on the floor on the way out and a waiter ran two blocks to chase us down. That was nice of him.

It was really a delicious meal. Perhaps it wasn't the right day for us to experience such a drawn out dinner."}
{"text":"The food here is spot on. It's a really fun menu, with some incredibly creative dishes such as pinenut sorbet between arugula madelines. This chef is solid. The place itself is fun too: loud, young servers, nice look and decor, and excellent bartender. 

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the whole meal was insanely long. Normally, I'm ok with a really long meal, but the dishes came out in weird spurts and then there was a really long time between the next dish. The timing needs to be adjusted a bit."}
