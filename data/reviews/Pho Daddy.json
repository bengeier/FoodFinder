{"text":"Finally a Pho place where you can have your meal totally customizable! I had the beef Pho, it was delicious! Their soup base is so addicting! Cant wait too see more menu or filling options!"}
{"text":"Ordered the noodle bowl for the first time here. So delicious. The Thai peanut sauce was fresh a little spicy and so delicious. We also ordered a beef satay Pho and it was stellar. Great music friendly staff quick and fresh food. It's Pho good !"}
{"text":"I wanna say it's good. I wanted to be a fan. But the sincere lack of meat and products is silly. The guy making the soup might wanna quit acting like some kind of big shot with the women in line. Focus dude.  Jimmy should maybe spend some time or send in a mystery shopper to see what's going on. I hope they change it around but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Another reviewer said it first, but I'll second it - this place is like Chipotle where you can pick and customize your toppings. They only have one type of beef (I saw some chicken but didn't try it) but the one that they have cooks perfectly in the hot broth.   The service was friendly, broth hot and noodles well cooked. I will def be back for more. The spring rolls were just decent, so whether or not I get those again will be a game time decision.   One of my favorite parts was the actually restaurant itself and how the entire front was open. I'm glad I checked this place out before it got too cold and when I assume they'll close the front door."}
{"text":"Excellent fast Pho. This was the ideal dining situation for a chilly evening. Spicy (but only as spicy as you ask for) soup and sweet coffee."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and have become a regular. The fresh made broth is amazing and what keeps bringing me back, but what brought me in originally is what makes me a regular. I had heard of Pho Daddy from friends, but didn't decide to check it out until I was waiting in line at the bank and Jimmy, the owner, came into this random bank and started talking up his shop, Pho Daddy, quite loud... I was amused by his tactic, so I check it out and now I am a Pho Daddy lifer, pho-sho."}
{"text":"Really bad pho place!!! No stars! $10 for Nothing! Meat amount was so little. I am not a pho person but the one pho restaurant I have been in edmonton called King Noodle house is the best pho I have ever had. But don't waste your $10on photo daddy. They are better in their shawarma only!!!"}
{"text":"Great space up a half-spiral staircase above 4th Street- very unique for Calgary or really anywhere. It's their soft opening and I got everything on the menu, which for now is to say spicy pho tai (rare beef, you don't have to get it spicy but I recommend it- FYI this isn't pho sate with ground peanuts but rather standard pho tai with some chili condiment added to the broth) and two veggie fried spring rolls. The spring rolls were fair but a sort of oddly fluffy wrapper- I prefer the crispier type. Also they were served with that sweet chili sauce you see all over the place, not a fish sauce based dipping sauce that I think is better for this item. On the plus side the rols weren't burning hot and, again, were not bad tasting, just not outstanding. The pho on the other hand was excellent! I love this concept- a sort of Chipotle style approach to pho where the soup is assembled in front of you and you add or omit what you want to. The flavour was very good, in fact I drank the entire large portion's broth, and the noodles in particular were just perfect, as good as the best in town. $12 for a large is a massive portion.  Hours are 11-8 M-Sat and 11-7 Sundays if I recall our conversation completely."}
{"text":"We were told about this place by someone from Edmonton. All their meats are halal. Seriously wow. You make your own and I had chicken. It was super delicious. This was my first time having pho so I have nothing to compare it with but omg I loved it. And they make their own broth right there. So healthy. I was so impressed. And I liked the sitting area too. It's not a formal restaurant, but more like subway. Overall, great food and great experience."}
{"text":"I LOVE pho! I've eaten it for years and I've had it made many different ways. For me, pho is like pizza in that when it's not very good, it's still pretty good. I've never had pho I didn't like and this place was just ok. Service was great, but the broth seemed like it's lacking flavor and the beef (while tender and of good quality) isn't very traditional. Great concept to be able to pick out how much and what to put into your bowl, but I've just had a lot better."}
{"text":"When we walked by the place looked cool, but when we went inside & ate here we realized how amazing it is. A regular in line said it was the best pho in the city, and he might just be right about that. Thanks friend.   The broth was the right temperature, very tasty and the noodles fresh, great consistency and toppings were fresh.  Each bowl is made to order, and she asks you exactly what you want. The best part was that you can ask for a spicy range all the way from one till 10 and nine is not even that hot. So next time I might go for a 10. The hot sauce was amazing, not just sriracha and red chili but also a really amazing tasty freshly made chili oil.  We ordered vegetable eggrolls which were good, But we will definitely be back for the pho."}
{"text":"Love the beef pho and the smell of their broth made the whole street smell amazing in the summer. The concept is really cool. I haven't been there in a while because I'm hoping they will add more menu items soon."}
{"text":"The broth is delicious - the owner says it's artisanal and may not be the same every time. It may not have the same flavour as I've had at other Pho restaurants but still delicious. What I love most is the customization of the Pho. They start you off with a custom line of building your pho, noodles cooked as soon as you order, with a choice of green onion, white onion, bean sprouts, chili oil, cilantro, a chili pepper (or more), basil, fresh lime, then your meat and topped with hoisin, hot sauce....super tasty!"}
