{"text":"Went here for brunch and was quite disappointed. I got chorizo benedict and my wife got farmhouse omelet.  My eggs whites were somewhat underdone, which doesn't bother me too much but even these were really on the undercooked side, my wife's omelet was good but somewhat small, however, our potatoes were terrible... over salted deep fried hash brown pieces.  Waiter looked and acted like he's just been dragged out of bed and wanted to be just about anywhere else but there - and ambiance/music was kind of noisy too."}
{"text":"This is one of my best friend's favorite places to go to happy hour. Went there for the first time this week for reverse happy hour. Our server, Daniel, was very attentive and cheerful. The food we had was very good (brie sandwich and chicken fettuccini) and the ambiance was really nice. I liked it so much that I went back the next day with my boyfriend. I had the most delicious lavender fizz cocktail. My boyfriend was a big fan of his burger. Our service was definitely not as great though. I liked this place and I will probably go back, but I wasn't a big fan of the inconsistent service and the prices were a bit steep even during happy hour."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Wish they wouldn't blast 80's music at teeth rattling volumes on the patio."}
{"text":"I was embarrassed to bring my out of town guest here last night for dinner, especially after going on and on about how delicious this place was.   Service was GREAT but something was really off last night; perhaps it was the cook that night.   Me: Chicken panini with Salut fries. Too much oil was used in grilling it, because it came out greasy, leaving an oily residue on my fingers. Fries were good, but I liked the way they used to serve it with the crumbled feta not shaved/dry feta.   Guest: Malbec burger with regular fries. Ground meat used for burger had chewy nerve endings and her fries were too salty to eat.   I'm just disappointed. Our meals certainly weren't worth what we spent on them. After this experience, I don't think I'll be back. Maybe this is a sign of things to come for this restaurant."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately it gets one star for the food alone. Maybe other things on the menu are better, but definitely steer away from the egg paninis. Maybe they ran out of ingredients? The vegetable one, which was supposed to have vegetables on it, had what seemed like less than an egg, one slice of tomato, 3 leaves of wilted spinach and some red onion. It was ALL greasy bread with no flavor (nothing really was inside of it). All that for $10. The service was good, but with so many other options in the area, why waste your hunger?"}
{"text":"Went here for a New Years Eve dinner. Service was absolutely amazing!! The food was great too. It was a preset menu for a 3 course dinner. The Hummus Nachos are to die for!!! Will certainly be back when I come back in town. Reservations are really recommended here."}
{"text":"New in town and found this place on Yelp. So glad I did! Staff are friendly and engaging, the vibe is casual and fun. And the sriracha hummus is fabulous!"}
{"text":"This place was ok for Tempe. A friend of mine and I decided to try a new brunch place in Tempe. I like the style of the restaurant. The food was decent, but are ya'll CRAZY! $18 for the first glass of mimosa and then 1 penny for a refill. I don't think so. I will spend $8 to go down town and get a whole bottle of champagne for $10.  That's not a deal."}
{"text":"Lovely establishment! Great wine and great atmosphere. $5 drink deals all day everyday with my favorite being the pitcher of rolling rock.  Recommend Greg as your waiter. He's the best and almost too nice. Salut!"}
{"text":"Really awesome menu & the food is consistently good. Cozy chill atmosphere & nice staff. Definitely try the hummus nachos!!!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are amazing. The hummus nachos are by far my favorite. It is also a very cute restaurant/bar. They have great food and drink specials during happy hour. Definitely worth a trip if you are in Tempe."}
{"text":"We come here pretty often and love love love the food, especially of course the hummus nachos. Amazing. Bring your out of town guests and wow them. I've had a couple mixed drinks here and liked their uniquness. The patio is so cozy at night. I prefer sitting outside here because of the atmosphere. The kabobs have a very well rounded spice and everything is incredibly fresh. The brie hive sandwich made my visiting guest deleruosuly happy. There are also many healthy options, which I truly appreciate. More recently we got to talk to David the manager who was entertaining, genuine and friendly. This is one of the places where I can take family or friends and know everyone will find something they are excited to try."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Delicious food. Great beer selection and an amazing staff. The bartenders Lindsay and Brian are very attentive and knowledgeable. Both of them took good care of me. The food is absolutely amazing, my recommendation for dinner is the malbec burger, if you make it in for brunch, try the hangover fries, or the chorizo and beer eggs benedict. Overall, I would definitely come back, but even if the food wasn't as good, the staff is enough to make me want to come back, everyone greeted me, and continually stopped in the make sure I was doing okay. The back and forth(banter) between the wait staff and the bartenders (Lindsay and Brian) was very entertaining and overall this place seems like the perfect \"after-work watering hole\" I'll definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing dinner as part of Arizona Restaurant Week! A friend and I stopped by and were not disappointed! The service was phenomenal, and our waitress Lindsey was great. For just $33 dollars each, we were able to have a three-course meal and a house glass of wine. For any interested, the hummus nachos, pesto alfredo, and \"make your own smores\" dessert were incredible. Do yourself a favor and make sure you stop by!"}
{"text":"Loved coming here a few times for happy hour so I really wanted to love Sunday Brunch, alas, was not to be.  After making a reservation a month in advance for a group of eight, we arrived at Salut and were relegated to what I refer to as an overflow table.  You know, the worst table in the restaurant that's usually given to last minute walk ins.  Directly next to the speakers for the band playing that morning.  Any chance of conversing with my friends, disappeared with the first set.    Granted, if you were across the room or even a few tables away, the music was fantastic.  But, I expect to have to shout to friends at a nightclub in order to be heard, not at a Sunday Brunch.  The manager was anything but apologetic or accomodating, his only comment was that it says there's music on the website.  And no, couldn't get another table even though when I asked, there was plenty of tables open.  Food was lukewarm at best and nothing special.  However, I do have to give a shout out to our waiter, Chief, he really worked hard and was very friendly, although he too had to yell.  C'mon, if someone makes a reservation, don't give them the worst table in the house.  Have to wonder if it had something to do with us not being part of the college set."}
{"text":"Simon was a great server and we enjoyed the brunch music, lots of Odesza! Food was good but the big let down was our drinks. A few of my group were having the bottomless mimosas which were mostly OJ; I told them to use straws to drink faster THEY'RE BOTTOMLESS! That's how it goes. I was drinking cocktails. As a bartender myself, I could tell that they were underpooring and by the second it wasn't much better. We will come back just for get great service again."}
{"text":"I went here after seeing a picture of their oreo pancakes on the flyer. (Menu description said cocoa based pancakes with white chocolate butter creme filling, and the photo actually looked like a big oreo) Sounds amazing right!? Well what i got was a normal buttermilk pancake with crumbled oreos and hersheys syrup on it... Not cool.   Eggs benedict? More like eggs beneDONT! The yolk was hard and not runny at all, Hollandaise sauce was overly lemony, and the ham was probably oscar meyer.   Fresh squeezed orange juice was luke warm.  Even after comping the oreo pancakes due to false advertisement, the bill was still 84 dollars for 4 people's brunch. Not worth it.  We were expecting great food based on their advertisements and pictures and this was just not the case. Ill be having brunch at crepe bar on weekends from now on."}
{"text":"I came in a large group and they weren't prepared for us, even though we had a reservation. Poor guy was running around to take care of all of us! I had the grilled chicken panini with a fried egg. Yum. I was such a fan that I came back that following weekend for brunch. The brunch portions were definitely smaller, but the breakfast potatoes are delicious!"}
{"text":"Great dining experience. Adorable rustic atmosphere. The Mediterranean tacos and the hummus nachos are wonderful. The service is friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Incredibly creative menu with fresh ingredients. If you're tired of the same ol' places, look no further. The food is amazing and the staff make you feel like family. David always makes sure the food is perfect and Simon never misses a beat as our server. There is no place in the valley that is going to give you the quality of food and service for the price. Truly a hidden gem. Best burger we've had in that price range. The bruschetta are beautifully crafted. The hardest decision is which to eat. Best part is, no matter what you chose it's guaranteed to make your heart smile. If you order the cheesecake you'll never be able to eat anyone else's again. Make sure you order two because you'll want to take one home. We absolutely love the food, ambience and staff."}
{"text":"Salut is in a nondescript strip mall close to ASU.  The owners have made the space into a cool, industrial vibe with a spacious patio.  We had a table outside next to some odds pillars which actually need up turning an otherwise expansive area into a quaint little dinner for two.  We started with some delicious mushroom ravioli.  The sauce was creamy and flavorful but not too rich and filling.  I went with a skinny mojito which turned out to be one of the better mojitos I've ever had the pleasure of consuming.  My beautiful fiancé ordered a champagne and chambord drink, following the deft recommendation by our waiter.  She loved it. It wasn't too sweet and definitely had some alcohol in there.  We ordered a Malbec burger and their chicken panini on a French toast bread. Both items were ridiculously tasty.  The wine and carmelized onions on the Malbec burger were the highlights of this perfectly cooked beef delight.  The chicken while not as spectacular as the burger was destroyed just as quickly.  It had a delicious melted cheesy and slightly spicy peppers that gave it a great flavor.  They have excellent drink specials throughout the week that we've already planned on going back for. I would definitely suggest that you check out this Tempe gem especially if your around the ASU/Tempe marketplace area.  Oh yes the server was awesome too."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Salut Kitchen Bar.  First, we went on a wednesday night (not the busiest for restaurants) However, the staff at Salut was so friendly and welcoming when we arrived.  We had a dog with us that recently had surgery (cone of shame status) all of the staff at Salut was so nice to dog! Even took his picture to put up on their dog wall.  We sat out on the patio on a rather chilly night. The staff was so quick to put on the heater and make sure we were comfortable.  Our server, Gabby, was very friendly--loved that she gave her suggestions without being pushy :) much appreciated! The hummus was as good as she said! Delicious. We also got the chicken pita...so good. those fries with the lemon and parm was perfect. Flavor all the way here...and friendly staff to match!"}
{"text":"Love the ambience and the service.  My favs are the humus nachos, skinny Bitch and piquillo pepper ravioli. .. Yum!! A must try for any occasion!! salut :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, staff and drinks! My first visit was for an ASU Alumni Mixer, and there was a delicious buffet, but it's still a buffet. My 2nd and 3rd visit confirmed this place is in my top 5! Love it."}
{"text":"Must try the hummus nachos! Out of this world yummy. Ordered the roasted corn salad and wasn't too impressed. The menu is great and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Meh, there are better places to get your Sunday brunch on.   I went here (for the first time) with a group of girl friend's for the Sunday Brunch that they serve, and as a group, we left disappointed. We were informed that they were completely out of their benedicts because something was wrong with their \"egg poacher\". I'm still left wondering how their pot of boiling water was broken in the kitchen. Between the seven of us we ordered the hummus nachos, the bacon grilled cheese, the skillet, the grilled chicken pita, one of the burgers and the salmon avocado. The hummus nachos arrived first, and even though every where online, on the menu, and on giant posters on their walls the nachos were depicted with five pieces, ours arrived with only four. The Salmon also arrived completely different than pictured or described on the menu. On the menu it says it's on a bed of seasoned arugula, mine arrived on a huge spinach and arugula salad that was mostly greenery. I tried the salmon and it was WAY over done and completely dry, it had the consistency of what I imagine cat food would have. I called the server over and asked for it to be remade, she told me that the salmon was all precooked and that the wait for a fresh piece would be way to long. I've cooked salmon many times and if they actually have fresh salmon in the kitchen it shouldn't take more than about 7 minutes to make a fresh piece that's done correctly. But I didn't want to play around with a kitchen that clearly couldn't cook salmon and was unable to poach an egg so I switched my order to the bacon grilled cheese because it seemed simple enough and hard to mess up, plus two of my friends were already eating it and said that it was pretty good. My sandwich finally arrived and was actually delicious! I was commenting on it and the two friend's that had the same sandwich asked if there was a tomato on my sandwich. There was, and it was delicious. Turns out their sandwich was delivered not only without tomato but also without the garlic aioli that mine came with. They tried mine, called the server over, pointed out the mistake with their sandwich and got it taken off the bill. That's three kitchen mistakes so far if you're counting, plus the disappointment in their inability to simply poach an egg. Service was slow, it was hard to order drinks. The one saving grace was that our server was able to split the bill correctly and did correct the mistakes by removing the one sandwich from the bill and getting my replacement order in quickly.   All though the bacon grilled cheese (when made correctly) and the bloody mary were both delicious, I would go else where for my dining options in the future. If you're going to pay for service and a meal out, it might as well be a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"I love this place and love the service. The Sunday morning brunch was lively and amazing! Our Server was sweet and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I am so in love with this place!!!!  There are many reasons to love Salut. First of all, the decor is done with recycled components, mixing old and new, makes for a very beautiful setting. The minute you walk in you can feel the friendliness of the staff. Salut is perfect for lunch with your friends or a hot date. :) The food is inventive and delicious and the wine/cocktails are amazing. If you haven't checked this gem out you must! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Magnifique! First time here.. Came with a girlfriend and her dog. Hummus, mushroom risotto, s'mores Moscato and a fabulous atmosphere ... who could ask for anything more!  Except an excellent waiter by the name of Glen!  Thank you Salu lfor a first to be many visits! K.C."}
{"text":"Went there twice. Both times I was disappointed because in oversight the drinks are weak and the food is average and everything is overpriced for what you're getting. In general I'm not a fan of places that don't offer good food or good people. It reminded me of a French restaurant very cold and uppity. Both times the service was not worthy of congratulating. The manager circled a few times but never came to the table to ask how everything was which was disappointing because a few things were bothering me. The first time I went our waitress was nice and after we paid, two girls from our table left and a new one joined, but the waitress never checked back on us so we had to flag her down. I asked her for a menu because i was going to order something to eat and when she came back with my friend's drink she didn't bring a menu. The drink was wrong which happens but just added to the disappointment. I never got a menu from the waitress so I asked for one From the table next to ours but the waitress didn't come back for 30 minutes and when she did it was only to drop off the bill for my friend s drink and she never even asked if we had wanted another round, which we did. I decided to go back a second time and got better service as far as check -backs, but the drink still came out wrong twice. Then what will keep me from ever going back was my salad. I ordered the strawberry fields salad and was so sad when it came because I was hungry and although I eat in tiny bites I finished it in 10 bites!! And it cost 11 dollars and looked like crap with only one piece of feta. Just not a fan for paying for nothing and that's how I felt there."}
{"text":"My experience here was awful.  The staff acted like we were lepers due to a Groupon and nobody seemed to be able to figure out what the Groupon was offering us....even though it was in black and white.  The manager was there but completely refused to come out to assist the clueless staff in any way.  There was an obvious training issue as the staff stood around like zombies trying to figure out what was going on.....one after another.  I decided to continue through and try the food.  Another complete disaster, a beautiful looking piece of salmon completely overcooked and ruined.  The chicken also resembled a hockey puck.  Returned the food barely eaten and did not even want to give the \"chef\" another opportunity to ruin more food on my behalf.  Even after all of this, the poor bartender.....nice guy despite being put in a terrible position by his obviously incompetent manager....told me that the manager was just too busy to come out and address the situation.  Good effort to right a wrong by the bartender, weak managing.  Maybe the manager was simply worn out from addressing complaints.  Never, ever again."}
{"text":"Came here to enjoy Easter Sunday and had some of the best service we have had in a really long time at a restaurant. Dylan not only made awesome wine recommendations but helped us navigate the menu and was attentive and friendly. We will definitely be back and will recommend this place! Being in the service industry it's hard to impress this group but Dylan definitely impressed us!"}
{"text":"Am I in Tempe?  I was told to come here by one of my coworkers because apparently it was so great that I just HAD to come eat here...well I did, and I was surprised. I expected this place to be ok because it's in a tucked away plaza on University, but let me tell you, the food was pretty darn good. Tried the Hummus nachos and haven't had anything like it, the drinks were dangerous because you couldn't really taste the alcohol and the food was well worth the price. TRY IT!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the staff was very attentive. Loved the absinthe mojito! We would come back here if we lived in Tempe."}
{"text":"Salut is an amazing place! The food is delicious with a menu to please all and the craft cocktails are out of this world. The ambiance is perfect for a classy relaxing evening with friends or a significant other.The price point is perfect and the type of crowd it is attracting is just what the Tempe area needed!!"}
{"text":"Truly a great spot. Good wine list and great food options.   I had the hummus platter that had an incredible Sriracha hummus and great pita bread. My wife had the Pistachio glazed Salmon and I had the Quinoa Chicken bowl.   Great service and fun music. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is really great. Me and my roommate found this place over a month ago on a Saturday morning and we've been going back almost weekly for brunch and drinks.  The menu is very creative, it has things (for brunch) such as \"cinnamon toast crunch chicken and waffles\" and \"hummus nachos\". After trying about half the menu i'm pretty much at the conclusion that everything is really good.  The bar staff is excellent. Brandon and Iuila have been fantastic in recommending foods and drinks.  If anything, make sure you drop by for brunch. They do penny mimosas ($18 all you can drink) and live music on Sundays. Overall awesome experience."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriends and OMG! Hummus nachos are to die for. So much flavor just explodes in your mouth. They also have half off bottles of wine every Sunday. Wish there was a place like this in Dallas where I live now. Great food and service will be back"}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times now, and each time the food and service is on point. I love all of the different bruschetta options, and my favorite thing to get is the Malbec burger. It's SOOO good. And of course the Salut fries are delicious. The last time I went I got a margarita and it was made perfectly and it came out quickly. Happy returning customer :)"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful and the service from our server Tyler was phenomenal! He was very engaging and attentive. He was able to give us suggestions on the menu and our beverages (which is very important).  He was probably one of the best servers I have had in a very long time.  Keep up the great work Tyler and don't change for anyone!  I enjoyed my visit to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Granted, it was the Groupon that brought me in...and brought me back!  Was there Friday night (it was quite busy), and went again today (not so busy).    Everyone is still learning the ropes, but is very happy to try and make your experience the best you could have.  My husband and I sat at the bar and had the pleasure of speaking to Dustin, the sommelier of the establishment.  This \"kid\" is only 27, but has the knowledge of wine, beer, and \"specialty drinks\" (even Mr. Harry Mitchell who was sitting next to me was impressed), along with the pairing of food and drink.  My husband and I learned SO MUCH from Dustin this evening.    Finding out that Salut was dreamed up with every customer in mind (great happy hour prices on food and drink for the \"pop in and go\" kind of folks, to the folks that want to sit, eat, drink, and talk for HOURS about their experience) was a refreshing change from the \"norm.\"    I love the fact that this is a dog friendly establishment, which is something that I've only seen in Scottsdale.  Seeing so many items \"recycled/reused\" was definitely a plus in my eyes as well.  OH!  And I LOVED the hooks for hanging purses at the bar... simple wine bottle openers that had been \"turned into the wood\" leaving just the handle for a \"hook,\" VERY CLEVER!  As my husband and I were leaving, we kept talking about who we would like to bring to Salut, how we hope that they decide to offer \"wine courses\" as part of their experiences, and we wish them the absolute best!  We also look forward to making this establishment a \"regular\" date night location for us.    Lastly...things we've tried and LOVE: -Greek Fries -Peppadew Peppers -Hummus \"Nachos\" -Chef's Board -Wild Mushroom Bruschetta -The WIne Flight -Kentucky Rose -Lavender Lemon Fizz Thumbs up on EVERYTHING!  Can't wait to come back and try something different!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing and service was smooth and professional, especially for such a new business.  The staff couldn't be better - everyone is extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  As far as the food - huge portions at a great price.  I recommend the Sun Devil turkey burger and a glass of pinot grigio :) Salut is exactly what Tempe needed!"}
{"text":"Food was really fantastic and the Sunday atmosphere very chill.   The musician they had was brilliant (Taylor?) and our server was very pleasant.   First time here and have already recommended to two friends before we have even left the restaurant.   Oh and they are dog friendly on the patio apparently... I thought that was a nice touch  Def Wil come back."}
{"text":"This is such an incredible place - awesome ambiance as well as food; however, this company is relying too largely on sales. The last time I visited I sat with my boyfriend at the bar. Although our bartender was friendly and knowledgable, he was too much. I was there on a date to enjoy the company I went with. Instead, I was interrupted constantly to be told about all the great things Salut was doing and has done. I understand restaurants have to make themselves relevant, but this was truly over the top. I hate giving a bad rating, but I really hope they change their ways. This place could be so much more. My thoughts are just that I don't want to spend my night talking more to the bartender than my date. Unfortunately it's unlikely I'll go back based on this experience, because we both like this spot a lot. This really left a bad impression. Please read your guests more accurately and let the establishment speak for itself."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend...  It was great food,  sew a tentative service, Sunday night was half off bottle of wine.    We split the Mediterranean Tacos,  and the Caprese Salad. The shrimp on the tacos were cooked perfectly,  the tomatoes for the salad were also perfect.   Service was above average,  the waiter explained their specials and the favorites which was highly talked about something with hummus.    I would recommend this for a healthy option or a lighter dinner.  I will be back sometime."}
{"text":"Tried this place for dinner a few nights ago. Was greeted by friendly staff and a nice, cozy atmosphere. The waitress was super patient as we couldn't decide what to order...everything sounded delicious!  We started with the hummus nachos. In my opinion, it's an absolute must!! The pita bread was perfectly toasted. The balsamic gave the perfect balance. Topped with a pomegranate seed to bring it all together. I ordered a burger and requested it to be prepared medium. It was more on the medium well side. Not a deal breaker. It was still very juicy! I do wish there were low carb options. Maybe lettuce wrapped? Still, this is definitely a restaurant that has earned a return visit."}
{"text":"Good go to place to eat and drink. I went just for dinner but I would recommend as a place to go pre-bar hopping. Food tastes awesome, good selection of food and drinks. The bacon grilled cheese is the perfect combination of sweet and salty. Also if you don't get your fries, make them Salut fries. Plus the waiters are awesome. I ate alone and Will was very happy to chat with me. Overall, definitely a place I would recommend going if you find yourself in Tempe. Super laid back, so doing go expecting the meal of a life time but a place to eat, drink, chill and chat with your homies."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. Went on a groupon and even with that discount it was still terrible. Food is more in line with Zipps not a nice restaurant. only difference is I would give Zipps 3 stars as I expect Bar what I get there."}
{"text":"Worst food we've had in awhile.  Horrid.  Salad with honey salmon had maybe 2 ounces of salmon.  My husband's salad had no taste.  My daughter's burger was actually soggy.  Our first glass of Chard was room temp.  OK, but then we order a glass of Rose' which should be ice cold...and room temp again.  Bad business.  AND we were there at 12:00 noon, with maybe 5 other tables in the entire place and the waitress is telling us how busy she is!!   We waited 40 minutes for our food.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour on a Tuesday with a friend. The server was new and suggested we get the hummus nachos (which sounded very weird and we weren't sure exactly what hummus nachos would come out like) but we reluctantly ordered them. I was pleasantly surprised. They are SOOOO good. I wish I could remember the servers name but he was super nice and attentive. Wine was obviously tasty. Atmosphere was trendy and fun. I love this place. Tempe needed a new wine bar that wasn't on Mill. :)"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great ambiance. Can seem like a very hip, very happening yet at the same time very intimate place to have dinner or a drink. I do feel as though the pricing is a little on the high side, but the food we had (burgers) was quite delicious. We also had the s'more which was overpriced $10 for a few pieces of Hershey's chocolate and graham crackers. The presentation was nice but not worth the $10. I thought there could've at least been some better chocolate for the price."}
{"text":"Right before I moved to Chandler, I got to try Salut!  We started off with the Chef's board-5/5  but we did find out they switch thigns out due to availability so you never know what you are going to get. We have had all the Panini's. All delicious. Try anything with Halluomi cheese it's so tasty.  My own main issue with this place is that  as a college student that used all of the social media, they marketed to me via instagram. Telling me to get wine. I am not a fan of alcohol (okay I am but I no longer drink).  So as long as their media coordinator isn't working it is all good."}
{"text":"(Cross-posted and slightly edited Facebook review; people need to know how great this place is!)  I've been here so often that I think it's time to write a proper review!  I've been a loyal customer of Oliveo Grill ever since I moved here in 2008. Being a night owl, I have ordered many a hummus starter or gyro platter to my door at 2AM many times. One night when I was picking up a to-go order, I saw a flier for their new restaurant, Salut Kitchen Bar. It advertised penny refills on mimosas, so naturally I filed it away in my brain. Then, some friends from out of town flew into Phoenix, and I knew just where to take them for brunch. It was phenomenal! From the food to the cocktails to the impeccable service, it was truly a brunch to remember.   I proceeded to come back for booze and yummy food even after that memorable brunch. And every single time, I've been met with both great service and fantastic food/drink. The hummus nachos are so good they should be illegal, their craft cocktails are delicious (especially the Lavender Lemon Fizz, OMG!), their beer list is fantastic, and basically everything else on the menu is yummy. Not only that, but the owners, managers, and bartenders have all personally introduced themselves to me and remembered me when I come in. Whenever I come by for a visit, there's always wonderful music playing - live music on Wednesday nights! - wine flowing, and wonderful people to visit with.   I can't tell you how happy I am to see this fantastic place thrive. It's by far my favorite place in Tempe.  My favorite menu items: Hummus nachos, Quinoa fritters, Quinoa bowl, Caprese salad, Malbec burger, hummus-stuffed avocado. Favorite cocktails/general booze: Lavender Lemon Fizz, Dirty Gin Martini, basically any of their Mules, and the House Pinot Grigio. I sampled one of their Absinthes tonight and that was great, too."}
{"text":"The happy hour specials and groupons lured me and my friends here on a weekday evening, but I was quite disappointed. First of all, about half the \"tapas\" (which are actually just appetizers) on the happy hour menu were the same price as they are on the regular menu ($5 or more) . Also, the food was alright. The peppy dew peppers were yummy, but the other \"tapas\" we tried were pretty mediocre, at best. They said they were out of one appetizer when we were ordering, but we saw another table order and receive it about 30 minutes later. They were short on menus, despite being far less than 25% capacity at the time. Some of these may just be growing pains of a new restaurant. There were also tons of flies around, which was pretty annoying. We didn't get any entrees so I can't speak to that, and the wines in the wine flight seemed reasonably good. Another drawback: if you get seated in the back section, there are no windows and very limited lighting (the waiter couldn't even see the water glasses well enough to know whether he needed to fill them up or not)."}
{"text":"Love listening to Taylor Ouellette play!!! Great ambiance and vibes! He is an awesome live performer and plays a huge variety of songs. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"One word. Penny mimosas! And they let you drink them ALL DAY Saturday and Sunday. While you're getting wasted on yummy orange juice goodness you might as well get the amazing food they have! I've never had a siracha panini but boy does salut do it right. The service is friendly and personable, and the bar tender is the funniest nicest guy. The service I get at this establishment, wow I like this place I'm gonna keep coming back here."}
{"text":"Very dog friendly patio and nice ambiance.  Brought water for both our doggies. My salad was good.  Ordered a Manhattan, what I got was not that, but still ok, and I drank it all. Server inquired about it so I told him it definitely wasn't a Manhattan, ingredients weren't right, but it was fine. When he came back with the check, he said the bartender had mixed up the recipe (\"the highball recipe was on the opposite page\") so they comped the drink, which was much appreciated."}
{"text":"You know it's a good spot when u come 2 times in 3 days!!!   Candace was on point on Friday night with our table. Very attentive! So good I am back today for brunch!!   Today I had an awesome Bloody Mary watching football on the patio. Gabby did a great job with our table and gave my friend the special treatment for her birthday!"}
{"text":"Darren greets you very well at this joint. There's no waiting around for a beverage. Their owner takes their spirit knowledge personally. Just ask him. Go here, it's a solid place."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere!  Loved the light food... especially the hummus nachos! I would highly recommend! Our server, Tyler, was amazing and took great care of us.  We'll be back.... maybe even tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Perfect little spot to bring a date in! Our server Brittany was attentive & friendly & spot on about her beer recommendations! We asked her what her favorite food items were & she picked the two items we had been eyeing! Great service & great atmosphere! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Malbec Burger was delicious!! Sangria was so refreshing!! Only problem was the super slow service for how few people there were seated at the time. Regardless, our waiter was super personable. Will definitely be back. Especially for happy hour"}
{"text":"I decided to give this restaurant another shot after hearing they had new management. We were with a big group and 4 of us had a bad experience. When the food came out (Salut Florentine Benedict, Beer & Chorizo) it was cold. When we told the waiter he took our food and 10 minutes later brought us a new plates of food. It was still cold! The eggs were supposed to be poached but they were overcooked, the biscuits were cold, and the hollandaise wasn't creamy and too sour. When we mentioned the hollandaise sauce they said they ran out of the store bought hollandaise sauce and had to make their own. Overall just another bad experience. The drinks and customer service were good though!"}
{"text":"Came back here again once for dinner before a show at Gammage with my mother and once with my husband for Valentine's Day. Still as great as ever! The S'mores were awesome! I made it for happy hour with my mom and the happy hour apetizes and wine were super yummy and for a great price!   The owners here really do know how to cater to the customers. When I was making reservations for Valentine's Day, I actually messaged them on Facebook and they got back to me right away. I think it's great when businesses actually have someone manning their social media regularly. I'm looking forward to a Monday where we can get s'mores and a bottle of wine for $20 after 8pm! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here. Food was so good. Really hit all my taste buds. We had the sampler, grilled cheese and caprese. So delicious. Food flavoring was perfect and fresh. Tyler did fantastic job. His knowledge of the menu and recommendations were on point. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to Salut a few times thanks to Groupon.  The first time we had a Groupon for 2 burgers and 2 craft drinks.  Burgers were good and juicy drinks were also very tasty.  Servers were very friendly."}
{"text":"Server Greg was great and the food was amazing! First time here and we sat on patio which was very comfortable with padded seats and backs. Had the hummus nachos which were delicious! Then the malbec burger that we shared. Tons of flavor! I am not a big burger fan but i would come back for that! Half price wine sunday too which you cant beat."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the service and the food.  Heard so many good things, but I  was dissatisfied.  Will not be going back here again on my next trip to Scottsdale.    Waited a long time for the hostess to greet us.  My husband ordered the hamburger and said it was fine.  I had the hummus and pita triangles. Really nothing special."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my friends and I had a terrible experience! My friend had made a reservation on open table for 8 of us. A couple of us got there a little early to get in for happy hour. They only had a table for 4 for our party. They told us we could wait at the bar while a table was set up for us. Another reservation of 5 came in with the same problem about a half hour later. Our table still hadn't been set up and they brought in another table from outside for this other reservation while we were still waiting. A ton of tables opened up but they kept giving them away to customers who just walked in. An hour had gone by before they actually had a table ready for us by which point we were done our food and decided to leave. Paying was even more of a nightmare. We ate on happy hour specials, but for three of us splitting a check they decided to charge us an already included 20% gratuity on what the whole bill would have been if it wasn't happy hour! (There also ended up only being 4 of us there so it was not a big party). So basically giving themselves about a 60% tip! So when we asked about it, it took almost half an hour to get our bill figured out with the bar staff. I originally paid with one of those Visa gift cards. I knew it wouldn't work to void it but gave it back to him anyway. I ended up putting it on my debit card. It took 6 days for them to fix the double charges on my checking account and 8 days to work out the void on the gift card. The owner was so nice and the food was alright, but so not worth the miscommunication between the staff and our wait time!"}
{"text":"Took forever for me to try this place, but when there was no parking at Four Peaks, we came here. We were really impressed with the food! Well prepared, flavorful stuff! I had heard about their brunch & really want to try it (&the bottomless mimosas). The Salut fries (greek fries) were the best I've had-very well balanced in dressing and cheese. The Sriracha burger was great. Not too spicy, caramelized onions, wonderful bread & tender, well prepared burger. The waitress was very sweet & helpful. She mentioned this is a new menu & I have to say I'm all for it. The prices are a little steep, but for something so well done, how can you haggle?! We can't wait to go back and try the tapas too. Other tables ordered them & they looked amazing. Overall, it was awesome. I can't wait to go again & recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Great service! I hosted my sister's bridal shower here in their back room and had an awesome experience.  Communication with management couldn't have been easier while I was planning.  The staff during the bridal shower were all very kind, accommodating,  and the service was excellent.  I would definitely plan another event here."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous dinner tonight . Brian was amazing. We started with the bacon wrapped chestnuts and ended with a fabulous Malbec. Every part of the evening was wonderful. We were there the night before for an event and they remembered us by name . We will be back !"}
{"text":"Two words sum up Salut Kitchen, fun and flavor! My boyfriend and I had an exceptional experience enjoying the service, food and music. Our server was Hannah, a genuinely kind person who was easy to talk with and had an ease about her that made for a great dining experience. Thanks Hannah! First, we enjoyed an appetizer of Hummus Nachos...yum!!! A small plate that packs a ton of flavor, and fresh flavor at that. Thanks to the outgoing and personable manager David, we found out the recipe for the hummus dates back into the history of owner's family. It is fantastic! For entrees I had the Beet Salad with goat cheese, golden beets, fresh greens, sliced apple, and walnuts. My boyfriend had the Pesto Alfredo garnished with a grilled lemon slice (so good squeezed on the pasta), and lightly toasted bread that as he stated \"perfectly complimented the pasta\". It all tasted fresh & delicious. Salut Kitchen knows how to pair flavors and they choose high quality ingredients. As vegetarians we were pleased with the options available on the menu. Of course more options are always welcome! If you do like eating meat, there is a good size menu for that too! To top off our dining experience we opted for the campfire S'mores! It was so much fun, we definitely felt childlike and playful. And needless to say it was a terrific dessert! Now, I have to give props to David as he chose the music for the night and honestly that is what got my boyfriend and I in the doors. It was old school, upbeat and fun. It totally gave off a great vibe! Thanks David! Last but not least my boyfriend and I took notice of the repurposed materials used to decorate and frame Salut Kitchen. Nicely done!  Thanks Salut Kitchen, Hannah, David and the talented chefs; you made our first visit to Tempe awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Servers do not bother you but are there when needed. This place hires well. Food is excellent and a bit different than what all the restaurants are doing. Best happy hour and great patio. Second time here and now my favorite place."}
{"text":"Today was my first time to Salut Kitchen Bar. I was amazed at the great selection of food for vegetarians. Everything looked delicious on the menu but I settled for the Quinoa Bowl. I am glad that I did since it was excellent. Even with the dressing on the side this salad was outstanding, very flavorful, and down right yummy.   Tyler, our waiter, was not only funny, sweet and caring he was very attentive to our table and the ones around us. I normally have to bug the waiter or waitress for water refills but not Tyler... He was on top of everything making sure we were well cared for. He also when the extra mile to interact with us and make us feel at home...   I will be back again as everything from the food, the location and the staff is well worth the drive from the other side of the valley. Hopefully, next time I am in he will be my waiter again.    Thanks Salut and Tyler!"}
{"text":"Driving by on University drive the exterior of Salut Kitchen Bar prompted me to do a U-turn and circle back. I am so grateful I did. This was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had.  Ask to sit in Simon's section. He is phenomenal. All of the wait staff came by my table at least once to check-in or assist in some way. My meal was amazing!! Cucumber water, desert iced tea, hummus stuffed avocado, quinoa bowl with chicken and lemon drop cheesecake for dessert. Everything I had was spot on!  I left feeling completely satisfied."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight with friends and were not disappointed in our food or with the service.  Since we bought the groupon, the two person deal included two craft drinks, two entrees (any of the burgers or entrees under $17) and one dessert to share.  Our friends had their own groupon, so it was nice to sample several different drinks and entrees.    The drinks we sampled included the cucumber mule, the lavender and lemon fizz, the peach fuzz fizz, and the prohibition manhattan.  The lavender and lemon fizz was definitely the lightest of all the drinks; the manhattan was the strongest.  My husband liked the manhattan but couldn't finish his peach fuzz.  Our friend and I were a fan of the lavender and lemon fizz (i particularly enjoyed how similar it is to real lavendar lemonade) but she especially liked the cucumber mule because it came in a copper mug that made it just that more authentic in taste.  Overall the drinks seemed well made with quality spirits.   We really liked the glasses and our waiter told us most of the restaurant's decor and furniture was made of reclaimed products.  All of our glasses were made from old alcohol bottles, which I really liked.  The atmosphere was intimate, the lighting was low, and the music was chill.  I fell like the booth we were in was a little tight and cramped - I would ask for a table next time.   Our friends order an appetizer while we waited for our entrees: the prosciutto bruschetta was good but our friends felt the drizzled honey was a little overpowering.  Personally I liked the little sweetness to balance out the salty prosciutto and tart granny smith apples.  I barely tasted the blue cheese smear and didn't even notice the almond - both which are pluses for me because I'm not a fan of blue cheese.  Our entrees came out and we were pretty happy with our individual choices.  My husband ordered the Italian panini with the greek fries - not sure what special spices they put in the fries, but those were very addicting.  Next time I'm ordering a plate of those for myself - no sharing!  The panini was very good - just the right amount of saltiness.   On the recommendation of our waiter I had the piquillo ravioli with chicken. I think it was a very good choice - it wasn't too spicy and the ravioli is stuffed with herbs, roasted corn, and parmesan.  The sauce was made of the piquillo peppers, wild mushrooms, and toasted pine nuts - similar to a chunky, roasted pepper sauce.  They placed grilled chicken on top of the ravioli, but I think I would consider it a win even without extra protein.  It came with two crostini that I thoroughly enjoyed sopping up the sauce with.   Our friends had the pistachio encrusted salmon and the grilled chicken panini - according to them they both enjoyed their dishes.  The salmon came on a bed of lemony orzo and brocolini - I enjoyed orzo but felt the brocolini was a little bland and lacked flavor.    We all finished with two orders of the s'mores - thoroughly entertaining as we caught our marshmallows on fire!  S'mores are a little too sweet for me, but it's campy fun (see what I did there)?  All in all a good time.  Our waiter was even nice enough to give us a free appetizer coupon on the way out - yay!  We look forward to stopping by soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service; loved the way the waitress introduced the menu!!! Out door seating needs an upgrade; cushions dirty and frayed!!!"}
{"text":"We were in Phx for the big game this weekend and had the an amazing experience at Salut!  We enjoyed the hummus nachos, Salut bison burger and the bacon grilled cheese! We also enjoyed some wonderful drinks in beautiful glasses!  Servers, Ro and Aaron took wonderful care of our Patriots group! Special thank you to owner, David for rolling out the red carpet for us!  Salut is a hidden gem in Tempe, everyone should know about!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. I like the laid back, quite atmosphere and attentive staff. The Mediterranean tacos, humus nachos, and salute fries are yummy. My favorite menu item so far is the Rustic Cobb. I love all the rich and bright flavors. The Florentine was OK, a little over sauced, but still tasty. I've never eaten the burgers but my friends rave."}
{"text":"Had one of my best dinners and experiences ever at Salut. The service was amazing. Hanna did a great job as our server, Jesse, the executive chef came to our table to explain the dishes and gave us recommendations, and the manager David truly cares. It is nice to know how much you are appreciated as a customer. And the food...delicious! We started the the hummus nachos (highly recommend) and quinoa fritters. The hubby had the Malbec burger, which he raved about, and I had the Siracha burger. Honestly two of the best burgers I have ever tasted. The ambiance is cool, the mules are tasty, and they had a fun classic rock station on to top off the vibe. Overall, great night and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hit up Salut on a Saturday afternoon and it turned out to be happy hour which was perfect! Half off a bottle of wine and discount appetizers. Tyler was our server and he was awesome - very friendly and helpful with the menu. The food was great, Mac and cheese bites, quinoa fritters, bacon wrapped water chestnuts.... The only criticism I have is portion sizes. The appetizers were very small- had I paid full price I would have been very disappointed."}
{"text":"I like to stop by time to time on their patio for lunch. The chicken skewers and Malbec burger are very good. A little bit pricey but they had a good wine list :)."}
{"text":"Came in a while ago and it was great came in again this past weekend and looked like all new staff. Our waitress took 30 min to get our drink order. Meanwhile she took two tables who sat down after us their drinks and food order before our drink order. We were her only three tables. After that it took her another 30 min to get our food order then never came to check on us we had to ask three times for the check and a box. After this past experience I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Having worked in the restaurant industry for the last 8+ plus, I have developed pretty high standards. Higher standards regarding the food and drinks, the timing, the atmosphere and to me the most important....the service.  I'm in town visiting from Denver and will definitely be telling everyone what a great place Salut was when I get home. My sister and I went for brunch, and started with some bottomless mimosas.....best mimosas I have ever had. I wouldn't go into more detail but my sister would mock me seeing as I haven't stopped telling everyone how great they are. Perfect balance of sweet from the Prosecco and acidity from the orange juice. We then (upon our servers recommendation) ordered the \"hangover fries\" which were wonderful to start out with while we got to catch up.  I could go on and on about the food, and the mimosas but what TRULY made it an amazing dining experience was the service.  Forgive me for the spelling.... but Jean-Paul was incredible. Like I said, I have high standards when it comes to service and I am not easily impressed but he went above and beyond. He was knowledgeable on each and everything we asked, had great recommendations, was attentive without being over bearing, he truly made our brunch a better experience. If you do head over to Salut I HIGHLY suggest siting in the gentleman's section."}
{"text":"I went here with couple of my classmates to discover a new place to eat. I was glad there was easy access with parking because I didn't want to pay for parking to eat. We sat outside with enough light and shade and it was a cute place. There were only 3 groups at the restaurant so it wasn't too loud.  It had lights and nice decor. It was happy hour (3-6:30) so The entree and Tapas was 2$ off. They also have happy hour on the selected drinks as well. I ordered the Mac & Cheese Bites ($9-$2= $7). I was surprised when the food came because the portion was small in a big saucer plate. There were 4 mac and cheese bites with spinach on the bottom with chipotle sauce to dip in. It was delicious. The outside was crispy while the inside was soft and well cooked mac and cheese. It wasn't too salty or bland. The sauce made a nice kick to the taste. The spinach was just spinach. Nothing special there. My friend ordered the Salut Fries($6-$2=$4) and it comes in a cylindrical can and this was very special. It had the perfect blend of Parmesan cheese, herbs, and citrus vinaigrette. I would come again just for these fries. Our food did come earlier than the utensils but the server was nice. The shoestring fries were crispy and perfectly drenched in the vinaigrette and the toppings. Overall the food, presentation, feel of the place, and service was good. For a first time at this place, I was pleased with my experience here."}
{"text":"A special thanks to Gabbie for making our meal fun. Service was superfast and the food was fantastic. Well done."}
{"text":"Service was great and patio are is very chill. There was live music on Sunday which was cool. Downside is food is nothing special. Pretty mediocre and way over priced. Looks cheap until they add the extra few dollars for any protein. Menu was dirty too which is gross. I would only go back for the outside are and great greek fries. Salads are pretty bland and corn salad was about two bites. So small! Lots of other places I would rather go to. Need to work on the kitchen."}
{"text":"The excellence continues...   Having returned more than ten times since my first review, Salut just keeps getting better. It's great for groups, intimate dinners or casual double dates."}
{"text":"After reading the glowing reviews here, I decided to go there for happy hour and I now find myself wondering if I was in the same restaurant that got those excellent reviews.  The atmosphere is nice and the service was good.  The food was not good.  I ordered the appetizer sampler plate.  The caprese tomatoes were hard and not ripe.  The mozzarella was not fresh.  The prosciutto was wrapped around cantaloupe that was not ripe and hard as a rock.  The fries were cold.  I will say the hummus nachos were very good, but since that was only 25% of the dish, it did not redeem that food.  I mentioned all this to the server as I think feedback is important, but she just gave me a blank stare.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Love'd the Quinoa bowl salad.  That dish was A+ ... after all, where do  you get a dish like that.  Since our night started at the bar, I also want to acknowledge bar tender Carissa and her apprentice Paul for making the start of out evening a blast. They had us autographing corks to be hung on the wall.  It was a fun night."}
{"text":"Brand new wine bar. Tried this place cause of Groupon, 3wines and an appetizer was a nice brunch. Met the owner great guy checked on us to see how we enjoyed everything"}
{"text":"Loved it! Best Bloody Mary ever, and Nathan is an awesome server. Hummus nachos are excellent, as well!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a go again.   Pesto Alfredo was good!  Mac and cheese bites not my taste.  Salads were salads with solid flavor.  Hate the oval bowl though.  Service was okay.  All in all... it was fun to try for the first time even if it's a tad overpriced.   Will have to try brunch next time!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Sunday. I had a veggie benedict sort of thing, which was very tasty, and I loved the tiny crisp potatoes. Portions were smaller than in most places. It was packed, but with our reservation we were seated immediately. It was a bit too loud with a live performer but I'd totally visit Salut again."}
{"text":"Thanks for spamming my phone with text messages. There's better ways to advertise your restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some co-workers. Nice outside patio, waitress was awesome. Had the Melbec Burger it was good. Asked for medium rare, cook was a little uneven and overdone but still great. The Salut fries were addicting!! Also had four bruschetta's: fig, pesto, caprese, and some apple honey one. All pretty good. Price was decent. $13 for the burger, $2 extra for the salut fries. Bruschetta was $4 for $13. Overall pretty good, Would come here again!"}
{"text":"Simply put, the food is solid (fresh and creative menu options) but the service is a work in progress.  We've tried Salut twice now, once for dinner and the other time for brunch. Both times we were very happy with our orders. For dinner definitely try the hummus nachos! Depending on your morning appetite, my bf liked the breakfast panini while I loved the fig parfait.  Word to the wise- DON'T order coffee here. We were initially impressed that our coffee came in a French press, however, being that we also have a French press at home, we could quickly tell by the taste that the press filter hadn't been cleaned in some time.  Finally, the service is in need of some coaching. I say coaching because while every server was extremely kind, they made too many mistakes. Dirty cups? No offer for cream or sugar with coffee? Wrong items on our bill? Again, nice people- they just need some help."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite brunch spots in Tempe. They recently changed their menu around a bit, and I think for the better! The hangover fries are amazeballs and are perfect with the morning burger, and the merlot burger is hard to beat as well. If you're looking for something more on the healthy side, I'd reccommend the salmon and avocado special, as that's really tasty as well.  Don't forget the mimosas!"}
{"text":"Love Salut! I've been here about 3 times now, and each time the food has always been delicious. Their hummus nachos definitely live up to their name, they really are amazing! The main thing I like about this place is the unique dishes, along with the nice atmosphere. Overall great restaurant and I'll for sure be back."}
{"text":"Love this bar!  Peppadew peppers are amazing!  Solid tap selection, and great service. The owner, David, is always walking around chatting with everyone. Great atmosphere.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I did not expect this at a wine bar, but the cocktails were excellent! I sampled the lavender lemon fizz with Bombay sapphire gin, Death in the Afternoon, and Dark and Stormy. Death in the Afternoon is one of my favorites and rather unusual, but they also serve absinthe by the glass ($5), which is a lovely surprise. We met friends for dinner; I had a panini with brie, apples, arugula, prosciutto and honey butter and Greek fries (shoestring fries with lemon balsamic dressing and feta). It's similar to another pricey favorite, the Citizen Public House gastro-pub, but much more reasonable and relaxed. There was a family at the next table toasting s'mores! They repurpose wine and liquor bottles for decor, and there's a big outdoor patio with lights and tables. Our server was attentive and helpful with suggestions, and had no problems handling our table's separate checks. I will definitely be heading back for happy hour (all cocktails $5)."}
{"text":"Amazing food and Service. The owner actually spends lots of time at your table. Very cool place. Amazing food.   Very unique craft beer. Awesome. Had a blast."}
{"text":"it's a decent place. food is OKAY... honestly, the location and patio is what keeps us coming back. they could definitley step it up a notch or two when it comes to menu items."}
{"text":"This place is worth trying! GO! we pasted by it several times then finally we went! Happy we did! Young crowed a lot like 4 peaks but older mature couples also. We like going here bc you do not have to wait for a table 30-45 min you can sit very quickly and the staff is extremely friendly *keep up the good work*. The Hamas nachos  are amazing so make sure you try them!  We love the music but then some time the music goes off track and can kill the vibe. Soooo.... Try and work on the music and we would pro stay longer! But going back soon."}
{"text":"Best tasting hummus I've ever had -   Ordered the burger and wasn't disappointed - finished off meal with s'mores! Can't go wrong here -- will be back for more"}
{"text":"I had the Grilled Cheese w/applewood smoked bacon accompanied by feta and vinagrette topped fries. The sandwich was excellent! The bacon was nice and crispy, without being burned, cheese was nice, hot & melty. The bread was good and crispy...i hate soggy bread on my grilled cheese. The fries were very tasty! They definitely take plain fries to the next level. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Service was slow. It was chilly outside and asked for a heater. Was told they would get to it when they get to it. Never got a heater. Not even worth the $38 groupon."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous this service was outstanding particularly Sierra our server, couldn't ask for anything better it was a wonderful afternoon and our doggie Dolly absolutely loved it! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm traveling on business and took a co-worker here. It was my first visit to this restaurant and it was awesome. It is hip, the service was excellent - friendly and knowledgeable, and the guy who I think was the owner was exceptionally gracious. Great small restaurant atmosphere and the food was unique and delicious. Really worth checking out."}
{"text":"I had a good time at salut. My server was great I think he was Greek or somesort? I had the watermelon salad it was great the halo mi cheese was delicious. I also had a bite of the salmon with borocolini it was average, I ordered a wrap made with quinoa and hummus the idea was good behind the wrap, the warp itself was pretty unexciting. One thing that I didn't like is that I was told that the second Bittle of wine would be offered at 5 cent buy when I looked at my bill I was charged 15 dollars still for it."}
{"text":"Very nice lunch spot. Our server was very friendly and the food was really good and has nice presentation as well. Loved the chicken kabob."}
{"text":"Great service! They loved our dogs and really made an effort to make them and us feel welcomed, even brought our babies water bowls. Not to mention the vibe is awesome and the food is more on the healthy side, which we love! It was a great experience! :) highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Overall, I would probably go back to Salut, but I feel it could be much better.  The design is pretty nice overall, but it was a little chilly inside.  The drink menu isn't super easy to follow and the beers don't even describe what style the beer is. For instance, Magic Hat was listed as a beer, but that's just a beer company with different beers. Also, they have several five dollar drink specials, but no $5 wines.  Since it's a wine bar, it would be nice to have a cheap wine option instead of a vodka red bull.    We had a bruschetta with apples, prosciutto, and goat cheese, along with some other stuff. Bread wasn't crisp and the ingredients were kinda boring. Would have been nice to see them chopped and mixed together instead of just being laid on top like an open face sandwich.  We got two salads. Girlfriends, bacon Caesar had a ridiculous amount of celery. It was pretty much a celery salad. My Cobb was good but the chicken wasn't cut into small enough pieces to eat.  I guess I should have cut up the entire salad cuz the spinach pieces were huge too. My mouth is gigantic and it was hard to eat. Good flavor though.  Prices were reasonable and service was good.  Sucks that it's a one person bathroom."}
{"text":"Friendly upbeat service! Who recommend food to try! Give great back stories on the owners and what to expect from the food and on point with steps of service. We tried the hummus nachos, and those were so great! The balsamic glaze is sooooooo yummy and the feta is just strong enough! The bruschetta was great too! The goat cheese and mushroom was my favorite!!! And then I ordered the butternut squash! It was rich and delicious! I would recommend they add some texture to the dish, some flash fried Kale, some Apple, maybe some walnuts, or pumpkin seeds...... it just needs a lil something!!! And the Habanero vodka sauce pasta with goat cheese was full of flavor! The sauce had some heat and it was nicely balanced! We will be back!!!! Also try the Cucumber Mule! It's refreshing and goes down smooth!!!"}
{"text":"Back in AZ for a weekend to visit friends and came here with a group for dinner. Great selection of wines and beers too if wine isn't your thing.  I had their burger which was good, though the fries were a little lackluster. The hummus nacho appetizer was amazing though, don't miss that!   Overall, a good spot for groups big or small. Seems it would be a good happy hour spot."}
{"text":"Great brunch menu, really good bloody's! The patio is a good vibe for a casual brunch date on the weekend! My husband and I really liked it!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of brunch and Salut does it right. We've been back several times. I love the Beer and chorizo and their bacon Bloody Mary. We bring our pup and sit outside on the patio. Very zen vibe. We choose this place over the old town brunch spots most weekends."}
{"text":"Salut has had a great start, and has a lot of potential, it just needs to be tweaked a bit for me to rate higher.  I have been there four times now and been seated inside and on the patio.  The service all four times was great!  Friendly, attentive staff.  I like the house-made cocktails, especially the cucumber mule (but you gotta like ginger beer for this one).    The drawback is the inconsistency with the food. Although I love the creativity of the dishes, I can't count on it being cooked the same way every time.  Case in point:  Hummus Nachos.  Amazing the first time; warm, slightly crisp pita with the hummus, balsamic drizzle, pomegrante, feta and red onion.  What a tasty surprise!    The second time the pita was overcooked, crunchy and quite greasy.  The third time it was undercooked, soft and not holding the weight of the topping well.  I think Salut is great in concept, the patio is nice and the staff is pleasant.  They just need to get their footing with the food.  The good outweighs the not-so-good though, and I'll continue to visit."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local wine bars in town! Excellent food, wine and atmosphere!  The staff is friendly, plenty of parking and fabulous patio! Be sure to save room for the smores dessert."}
{"text":"My mom first introduced me to this place over a year ago and I am glad she did.  Its a nice sized place and has a great atmosphere and friendly staff.  We started out with their hummus nachos which is what they are known for.  You get some pita with a good lump of hummus, topped with red onion, feta, pomegranate.  This is a must have while your there, you wont be disappointed.  Afterwards we had their wild mushroom ravioli followed by quinoa fritters.  To pair with this we had a wonderful white wine selected from the reserve list.  This place is great for watching the game, casual meet up or first date. Additionally they have a rewards program you can sign up for to receive additional discounts.  http://www.salutkitchenbar.com"}
{"text":"We loved this place! Everything we had was amazing. Our server was great! She was really helpful, honest and her enthusiasm about how great certain items were, really helped steer us in the right direction and and made me really excited to try everything.   Appetizers: pita nachos- loved how crispy and chewy the pita was.  fig bruschetta - my favorite appetizer. Perfect balance of flavor. Creamy, salty and a little sweet. mushroom bruschetta- really good, but the fig was so amazing I would rather get all fig next time.   Entrees: Filet with chimichurri and avocado horseradish aioli- this was amazing. The filet was grilled perfectly medium rare with great smoked grill flavor. The sauces were both amazing too.  Chicken Kabob- I didn't try it but heard it was great.  Kids mac and cheese- loved this. My favorite mac and cheese I've had in a long time.   Dessert:  limoncello with berries- I loved this too! The berry mix had perfectly sweet blackberries and blueberries. S'mores- so much fun for our 6 year old to make that we had to join in too :)  Wine- bought 2 bottles: Calina Carmenere- I usually drink Pinot noir, but I am glad I tried this. Smooth, not bitter and a little lighter than Pinot.  We also got a bottle of Moscato. I'm not a huge fan of Moscato, but this one was not sickly syrupy sweet and I could drink it."}
{"text":"Must try the cinnamon toast crunch chicken and waffles... They are awesome!! Had the salmon bruschetta as well, pretty good, the potatoes were a little undercooked though."}
{"text":"Salut is awesome!! I love coming here. Had one of the best experiences on behalf of my server Tanner! I work in the industry so I understand how much talent and personality it takes to be attentive, polite and awesome when serving a table. We'll be back to see him again!"}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week. Food is swing and a miss. Service is excellent hence the three stars. I feel bad saying this but for the price - there are far better, more entertaining, and much tastier places to eat in Tempe."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with some friends. The food is okay, not great. The brunch sandwiches have nothing to them and they are mostly bread. The eggs benedict was nothing special but it was still good.. The only real problem that I had with this place was that their mimosas's have very little champagne in them. They have a bottomless mimosa special on the weekends and it would be worth the money if the right amount of champagne was in the glass."}
{"text":"The food is pretty darn good. I am a fan of the breakfast, especially the Cinnamon Toast Crunch Chicken and Waffles.  My only complaint would be that the it's a bit overpriced (especially for dinner) for the serving size and what you're getting."}
{"text":"We had a patio table and had an excellent evening.  The atmosphere was warm and friendly, and the waiter accommodated our 2 kids without any problems.  The hummus nachos were incredible- I'd have to have this again.  I wasn't crazy about the gouda proscuitto bruschetta, mainly due to the jam on the bread, but it wasn't bad.  The chicken chasseur was excellent, as was my husband's piquillo ravioli.  We've heard a rumor that there may be another Salut kitchen opening in Phoenix and we look forward to that as it would be closer.  Definitely a great meal!"}
{"text":"Went here with a Groupon for 2 craft cocktails and 2 burgers with Salut fries or Greek salad.  The craft cocktails were far too sweet for our taste and pretty small for the price - next time I'll stick with wine or beer.  The burgers were large and excellent with homemade buns.  My turkey burger  was meaty, juicy and full of flavor.  The burgers were so big we both took half home.  The Salut fries are regular fries with Parmesan and feta cheese plus a lemon vinaigrette which I felt made them somewhat soggy- I would have preferred plain fries.  The Greek salad was a Greek salad, enough said.  Parking was easy since the restaurant is in a strip mall on the edge of Tempe, unlike going to Mill Ave. I'd go back to try some of the nachos or a chef's platter with wine.  Definitely steer clear of the craft cocktails if sickly sweet isn't your thing."}
{"text":"So impressed by this new Tempe gem.  My friend and I came in for dinner last weekend, and were immediately pleased with the decor as well as the service.  The recycled palet wood used both decoratively and functionally was SO well done, and the lighting is beautiful!  Our service was perfectly timed and friendly.   That said, I am not a person who enjoys a restaurant simply for the scene and good service. Your food must match (or at least approach) your ambience, and Salut's menu absolutely did :)  We began our meal with an order of Ciprian Salsa bruschetta, which was lovely and fresh.  I enjoyed the roasted corn salad as an entree, and my friend had the brie hive.  Both were fresh, seasoned well, and portioned perfectly (especially for a health-conscious preggo; not too little, but not so much that I left feeling overly full!) Can't wait to bring my husband back here for one of their signature drinks or a glass off of their wine list (see you in a few months, Salut!)"}
{"text":"Great find! We left Four Peaks Brewery because we didn't want to wait 45 minutes for a table & came here. Cobb salad & applewood chicken sand were delicious. Great happy hour, too."}
{"text":"We are here in town for the very first time enjoying our honeymoon ! We decided to uber to Salut on a whim and absolutely loved the service. We sat at the bar and met Will. He was fantastic. Will shared lots of information about the menu and specials including half priced bottles for happy hour. We were also served by Raven who was also amazing. They were both warm and welcoming and gave the best service on our honeymoon. We ordered the Mediterranean tacos and fries they were absolutely delicious. We will definitely be back like tomorrow !"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Great salmon and kebobs, salads and drinks.  Not a big fan of the ambiance, but the service was solid and the food was very well executed."}
{"text":"We went to Salut last night on a recommendation from a co-worker. I'm glad he likes it, but our experience was sub-par. First, it was not anywhere near as busy as I was led to believe it would be. We made a rez for 6 (because I was told it was super busy later in the evening), but even by 7:15, only a few others had come in. Service was poor. Our waiter was nice, but after I told him a needed a few minutes to choose my entree, but that our app could get started, he never came back! We had been finished with our app for awhile before I finally flagged him down and told him we wanted to order. He also didn't come back to refill our drinks until after we were done with our meals.  As for the food...our app (fried mac-n-cheese balls) were just ok. Frankly, they were clearly overfried and were way too crunchy. My husband got a simple chicken wrap, which was ok, but my butternut squash ravioli were terrible. The menu description stated they were in an alfredo \"sauce.\" More like and alfredo pudding. It was so thick, you couldn't even see the ravioli and the sauce overpowered the pasta taste. Both of our meals were also lukewarm, which based on how not busy they were, they should have come out perfect. I didn't even eat half of my meal.  Perhaps we just hit a bad night in the kitchen, but that's really no excuse, and certainly no excuse for the service. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Salut is amazing! The food is delicious and very unique. Its nice because it is not right in the middle of the craziest part of town, but is still very accessible. The staff is so friendly and it is a relaxed environment. I would highly recommend it to people who have not been there!"}
{"text":"I came here with a small bachelorette party, and this restaurant was exactly what we needed.  First of all, due to a humorous run of events, we were about an hour late for our reservation, with just one of our party there to hold down the fort.  The hostess and waitress were super understanding and friendly about what was surely frustrating for them to accommodate.  Other good news about the behind-the-scenes action: some friends of the bride-to-be who couldn't make it in, called ahead of time to buy a bottle of champagne, a first round of drinks, etc and (at least to our knowledge) this went off without a hitch.   We sat on the patio, which I should mention is dog-friendly.  There are heaters if the whether requires it, but it was a lovely night out.  All those who were drinking really enjoyed their champagne and various mule concoctions, and we got a kick out of the water glasses made from recycled wine bottles.  We had the Prosciutto Wrapped Melon and Hummus Nachos as starters, which were both really good.  I went for the Bacon Grilled Cheese Sandwich (hold the bacon) and was very pleased... I'm sure bacon lovers would enjoy it just as much served as described!  One side of the toast was slightly burnt, but the flavors of the cheese and tomato made up for it.  I upgraded to the Salut Fries, which is a must-do.  I would definitely order this sandwich again!  The Brie Hive looked super great too, which I would like to try someday.  This is a good spot for a bite to eat with a small group of friends or for a date.  The atmosphere is a little hipster, and the service was accommodating.  Their happy hour looks great too, but we were (way) too late to enjoy it this time... maybe next time!"}
{"text":"My new favorite wine bar in the valley! The food is unique and absolutely delicious!   The service is fantastic. They are attentive, fun and very personable to all who come in.   You can definitely tell the owner is very passionate about his restaurant and it shows.   I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, food is delicious and service is great. Happy Hour is so worth it and I'm in love with the brunch food and mimosas here. Not once have I come here and not enjoyed it, the hummus nachos and brushetta are a must try!"}
{"text":"Great service & great atmosphere (every time for me), excellent menus and a great brunch! And the bar's Bloody Mary is delicious... horseradish, olive(s) and a strip of crispy bacon! Ask for a little spicier and a salted rim!"}
{"text":"Figured I would give this place a try even though the food is a bit pricey. Atmosphere is very nice and the bartenders are great! I ordered the chicken sandwich with a side salad. Salad was great but the sandwich itself lacked real flavor. I was all set to give out more stars but I noticed the big guy in the glasses (manager?) giving multiple drinks out for free to ONLY women at the bar. Nice, dude. Classy move. Also, I saw the bruschetta, don't order it if you expect it to be like Postinos..."}
{"text":"Came to Salut with high hopes.  The ambience is nice.  Service and food were terrible though.  Ordered the salmon avocado and it was awful.  Cold chopped up salmon that tasted like it came out of a bag served over raw arugula, warm potatoes and a bit of underripe avocado.  I ate 3 bites and couldn't eat anymore.  The rest of the food ordered was under seasoned but not terrible.  When taking my plate the bartender asks how it was.  I reply that it was pretty awful and he shrugs and walks away.  We ask for the check to go to a different restaurant to get edible food and, after paying, I comment that the dish was really bad and the bartender says, \"can't win them all.\"  Shitty, shitty service and shitty, shitty food."}
{"text":"I live right down the street and this has become our favorite happy hour spot. Great patio, really great atmosphere. Most important, great wine (white on draft!) and the appetizers are delicious. I definitely recommend the bruschetta! Very friendly staff, great service."}
{"text":"Like the ambiance and decor.  Food was great, had the strawberry salad and the grilled cheese with bacon."}
{"text":"Great brunch.  Enjoyed the service, bottomless mimosas, friendly crowd and dog friendly patio.  Everyone on the staff was very friendly and they food choices were very good and there were interesting selections.  My friend got a hummus platter which was really good while I stuck with the Florentine Benedict and Hangover Fries - both really good, the hangover fries can be a meal in itself.  Although it's not close to me, I will definitely plan to return and maybe bring my Scottish Deerhound along."}
{"text":"Tried to like this place and have given it numerous chances. I've been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and have always had a bad experience. Service is poor, food is not good and overall the place is overpriced for what you get. There are small, basic things that could be changed to help this place out. Tempe could use a great wine bar with dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"Favorite of mine when in PHX. Great wine, great staff and great for our big family dinners on the patio!"}
{"text":"Good drinks and atmosphere. Food was decent. Stay away from the chicken kabob though!"}
{"text":"I love a wine bar. This one is in an unfortunate place on University across from that plant so it's not the best location IMO. However the door and drinks are good! A bit pricey for what you get, but there are great deals and coupons online all the time so I won't complain."}
{"text":"Super chill spot. They have a nice patio with a fan and A/C. The drinks where 50% off on Sunday!!! I plan to go again and try the s'more."}
{"text":"Can't wait to get back to Tempe next week and get my fill of all that I love at Salut!  Can't decide which of my favorites I will have first, Hummus Nachos, Quinoa Salad or the Salut Burger, but one thing is for sure, I will enjoy some of my favorite wines and cocktails and some of the greatest service!"}
{"text":"This is the best Happy Hour spot in Tempe.  The service is good and the food is farm-to-table fresh, with vegetarian options.  Prices are reasonable, especially considering the HH wine discounts.  The burgers are outstanding, but my favorite is the hummus nachos.  There is rarely a wait, and it's a good place to bring work colleagues -- not too loud, not too many TV's."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and they have a dog friendly patio even a wine that helps shelter!"}
{"text":"Overall, good.  I just had small plates and looked around.  The bruschetta looked just ok.  Good wine list/ok beer list.  The Greek fries, hummus nachos, and stuffed peppers were good, but not amazing.  $8 does seem a little steep for four small sweet cherry stuffed peppers.    If I go again, I'd try the chef's board, quinoa, or corn salad.  Bruschetta looked light the preparation may have been rushed.  Service was good in the beginning, but very slow toward the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and drinks with a friend. We sat at the bar with Matt. He was very attentive and personable. All around great atmosphere. The food was great. The Absinthe set up was pretty cool and fun. Again the service was our favorite part. Matt was awesome! He only works Sunday nights and is moving away so get in here before you miss him and his awesome service!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  We happened upon this place after Four Peaks was packed and we didn't want to wait an hour for a table, and so incredibly glad we did!  Walked right in and were seated right away.  It has a love ambiance, warm, dark and inviting.  The service was fabulous, loved the gal helping us, she was friendly, helpful and just a solid human being.  The happy hour runs through the weekend, so we were able to snag some great deals on food - the shoe string fires (Salut Fries) with lemon and cheese was UNBELIEVABLE!  I am fairly sure it took us roughly 2.6 minutes to clean up the whole thing.  Fresh ingredients, homemade balsamic reduction, and deliciously and plentiful beer and wine options makes this place a totally win!  They have a cool array of absinthe drinks too, which we didn't try but they looked intriguing.  We loved everything about this spot and will totally be back when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Friday night, place was not busy. Waiter forgot to bring drinks. Ordered appetizer only to be told 15min later they are out of said appetizer. Also out of a wine that a friend ordered.  Place is a renovated spot in a strip mall.  Atmosphere is ok but location is not desirable.  Good luck staying open thru the summer!"}
{"text":"We have gone to Salut on several occasions.  The bartenders are always friendly and attentive.  We love the food, especially the hummus nachos!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Lots of choices, great variety. Delicious food, wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"New Year's Day, morning after food, with a little hair of the dog, was exactly what we were looking for. And I don't mean the dog-friendly patio, however, if we are ever up here with our dogs, we will be sure to bring them. The Skillet was delicious, and they did the egg exactly to my liking, the Bloody Mary was a little mild for our taste, but was good. The Cowboy Omelet also hit the spot after a night of indulgence, and of course, you can't end a New Year's brunch without tableside s'mores with your own fire pit. Delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome service and desserts! The GM made it his personal mission to make sure we were happy. Great experience."}
{"text":"This place is sort of a hidden gem. Tucked away in an unassuming strip mall, Salut has a creative selection of cocktails and fun fried hipster apps. The service is usually on the slow side as the mixologists take far too long with their craft. But still a great spot nonetheless."}
{"text":"Came her for brunch. We were sat immediately in a dark back corner. Our server was very sweet but seemed overwhelmed. Apparently their computer system went down and we sat for 20 minutes before our drinks came. $18 for bottomless mimosas with penny refills, way too juice heavy. We both ordered the florentine Benedict and for $3 extra we ordered the hangover fries. We were both pretty disappointed. Not much flavor in either. I will try again for dinner since the patio is pet friendly."}
{"text":"We came here when a friend from out of town was visiting. As we have been here already, we knew it offered a good selection and different options for everyone. She's gluten free as well, so it worked out well for everyone. We got drinks, appetizers, and dinner. The lavender fizz was great, so was the house pinot noir and the pitcher price is great for those drinking beer. We got the Salut Fries for the table and they were heavily doused in their dressing which got a bit soggy when we got to the bottom ones. I got the BLT and it was really good, enough for two. The burgers were great as well.  Overall pretty good for a decent price."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences we've had at a restaurant. We were greeted outside, which really set the tone for our entire visit. The decor is nice, the service was excellent, and the food was amazing!! There were 3 fantastic beards in the building, which made everyone feel safe. The absinthe was a really cool thing to try and the happy hour prices are fantastic. You must have the Hummus Nachos!!!"}
{"text":"For four years, when it was only a 10 minute walk away from me, I obviously never went. My coworker suggested Salut, there was an app on Hooked for BOGO burger, and a break from work was desperately needed so off we went.    My friend and I ordered the Malbec burger, medium-rare, sans onions. I appreciated the pretty interior while waiting for our food. The lights were interesting to look at and there were bottles of wine stored in a glass showcase on the back wall. There are high chairs to sit at the bar, or tables, or booths inside and plenty of seating outside as well if you're in the mood for some sun and breeze. Our burgers arrived with heaping fries on the side. Delicious! The burger was cooked to perfection and tasted impeccable with the Malbec sauce and mushrooms. I think my favorite part of the burger was the bun. Brioche buns toasted slightly with butter. MHMMMM.   Just the burger alone was quite filling. I couldn't eat the fries. I'm glad we decided to forgo an appetizer because I can't even imagine how full I would have been. The restaurant was relatively empty as we were there, but it wasn't ghost town. The only downside is that they have only 3 burgers (if you want to use the Hooked deal) and the sandwiches on the menu don't count. There was a large sign that advertised 50% off wine by the bottle during happy hours. Not bad at all!   Give it a try if you're looking for a juicy flavorful burger and some good wine :)"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. Their chicken panini had a three inch piece of bone in it so I had been carefully picking through the meal when I saw a blood vessel (looked like an artery). I was totally done with the sandwich at that point. The fries were tasty though."}
{"text":"Very glad I tried salut! I got the oh honey--pistachio salmon and to finish s'mores :) loved it. The boyfriend loved it as well he has the steak. Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"1 star for atmosphere. Zero stars for food and service. Food has absolutely no flavor. Eggs came out dry and cold, bacon is all curled up and chewy and the potatoes didn't have any seasoning. Service started out okay but quickly dwindled. Not impressed."}
{"text":"The Skillet plate was so amazing. Fresh ingredients and so much flavor. My husband ordered the chorizo beer fries and they were pretty dang awesome too! This place was not what we expected in Tempe. We were very surprised and pleased! We kind of felt like we were having brunch in Scottsdale! Great place to come for mimosas as well. 50% off bottles of wine and champagne on Sunday's! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch. Nice atmosphere, waiter was very personable and the prices were fair.  I had the quinoa salad and it was so yummy! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great brunch place (they offer brunch on Saturday and Sunday).  I opted for the breakfast nachos, which were great.  My husband ordered the Oreo pancakes.  Bottomless mimosas are on the menu as well as bacon Bloody Mary's.  Food and service was great.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love Salute!  Been going here since it opened, for dinner and lunch.  Went on Sunday to watch football with friends, and had the veggie sandwich and the chocolate cake.  Everything was great as always!  Love that the patio is dog friendly!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. I was so ready. Maybe I walked in with my expectations too high but... I don't know.  I came in with a Groupon for 2 drinks, 2 entrees and the S'mores. So let's start with the good. The food was very good, we had the italian panini and the piquillo ravioli, drinks were also good (if a bit overpriced), Death in the Afternoon and the Prohibition Manhattan. The S'mores were a cute touch but flavor-wise... meh. Just regular bland s'mores. The bar is very nice. I love the steampunk style decor and the layout flows really well.  The bad. It was sooooo hot. My date and I were both uncomfortable and it just kept getting warmer. When the s'mores came were both laughed because the little hot pot made it even hotter. The music was really bad reggae which seriously clashed with the ambiance of the the bar. I don't know why a business that obviously put so much effort into establishing a specific ambiance would overlook something as important as the music. The server brought the check without asking us and we weren't done, which is so irritating, We had planned on ordering another round of drinks but when that happened we decided to just leave because it was too hot.  Finally, we were charged for all 4 of our drinks even though the Groupon should have covered 2. I noticed our tab was higher than it should have been, but I didn't want to split hairs over 21$ on a second date.  Good food and drinks, but it's a bit too expensive for the all the problems. I don't think I'll be returning and I'm kinda bummed."}
{"text":"I went to Salut again, and as the novelty of this place is starting to wear off I still really enjoy this place. They have a genuine feel to this place, that I really like. I enjoy the food, the selection of wine and beer.. but mostly I do enjoy the service.   I started off by trying the Odell 90 Shilling Ale from Colorado, which I might have had before but I enjoyed it. After mingled a while with an empty glass I wanted to try the pumpkin ale they have, but they ran out. Instead I tried a strange beer with a name like magic hat - the awesome transylvanian behind the counter wanted me to go for a super hopy number, but I wouldn't let myself be persuaded.    After Happy Hour I was, however, talked in to stay for dinner.. and I had the Chicken Panini, and also a half of the Brie Hive (so good) with the greek fries. Very tasty I must say.   This was my third visit, and I am still just as pleased with this place. The food is good, but the service is personable and knowledgeable, and the ambiance intimate and mellow, and these are the true selling points here."}
{"text":"Had a less than desirable experience so am not recommending this place, plenty of great restaurants around.  Ordered a simple omelet and came out missing most of the ingredients.  Not a big deal.  Took it back into the kitchen and sprinkled the missing cold cheese, cold mushrooms, and everything else that was missing.  Waitress said she personally looked inside the omelet after the cook said it was not missing anything and the same omelet came back out, YIKES!  When confronting the manager, he didn't seem to really care and just said \"okay.\"  That is where the issue is, poor management.  Don't recommend."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan, especially of their hummus nachos and wonderful quinoa salad!  Love the casual atmosphere and service has always been good.   My only criticism is that the music is always too loud(not normal as it states in the description).  So, if you want a place to have a quality conversation, this might not be it!   But food, wine and service may outweigh all that for you."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and flavorful. I had the bruschetta of my choosing and they all had a unique flavor. The apple brie sandwich was absolutely delicious along with a Greek side salad. The service was good and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. The bartenders were so nice and made me a phenomenal martini to end my evening."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when it first opened. My friend and I haven't been there in a year and we wanted to give it another try due to the food taking at least 30 minutes to come out.   I ordered the chicken skewers it comes ( 40 min later)  with veggies of course and hummus..   My order was burnt, and the hummus was crusty..I took a few bites and told our server that I did not like it, all he said was okay he did not ask me if I wanted something else or why.   Thankfully we had the salut fries as an appetizer which is the only thing that came out right.   It was time for the check and another server came up to us along with our server and again nothing was done.  They both walk up to the bar and I'm assuming the guy behind the bar was the manager they kept on looking at me, clearly talking about me. Our server brings over our check and tells me that he gave me 10% off.. What a joke!  I am really disappointed and I surely will not go there again it's over priced for the quality of food they are serving."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, loved the mimosas...but our waitress was rude! Don't remember her name, she wore really dark lipstick and a hat. Might be enough to deter us from coming back."}
{"text":"Meh. Bottomless mimosas were 98% orange juice. I actually had 6 and felt NOTHING. Bloody Mary had less than a regular shot of vodka. Bacon was chewy and undercooked. Ordered benedicts with chorizo gravy - the gravy was excellent, but the eggs were undercooked. I really wanted to like this place, but $100 for 3 people and we didn't even get a buzz... It's off our brunch list. No good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Bloody Mary but I ordered a waffle and it was god awful. Also they sat my party of 8 outside where it was hot and gross. The misters were not even blowing in our direction. The service was not great and they hardly checked on us. What a waste of money! I am never coming back!"}
{"text":"For drinks, not a bad spot.  It's a decent atmosphere a good selection of beer, wines.  For food, based on the one item I have ordered, I will not return.  I ordered an appetizer of hummus with veggies.  The plate arrived with a small bowl of hummus, carrots, celery, cucumber and pita.  The carrots were cut into nickel and quarter size slices (and about as thin).  They were dry...as in when you leave them in a fridge all night uncovered.  The celery was bruised, dried and even a bit decaying on one side.  The cuc's were sliced too thin to even dip them in the hummus.  I didn't even bother trying the pita or hummus and sent the dish back.  I was surprised anyone would have the poor judgment to serve the poor quality of food that was on this plate.  This speaks to a poorly operated kitchen and chefs/cooks that just do not care, IMHO.  I suppose my expectations were too high.  A college town just cannot support more than one or two decent wine bars and this one is suffering from an identity crisis.  Cater to adults that expect good drink AND good food or cater to 20-somethings looking for cheap drinks?  I admit, I'm quick to judge and loathe to give second chances, but seriously, if you can't pass an appetizer test, why would I drop even more cash on dinners there?"}
{"text":"Love this place, have for years. Today was terrible. We were sitting right by the wait  station and had empty wine glasses surrounded by a wait staff of 8 talking to each other with no acknowledgment. This was HH and it wasn't busy. Super disappointing and we left."}
{"text":"Very disappointing!   I was told there was a 10-15 minute wait to order food due to the kitchen being backed up. I decided to wait because it was like waiting to be seated when a restaurant is crowded. While I was waiting I was given a glass of water but the bartender did not ask if I wanted another beverage. So after what seemed like 10 minutes and eye contact he asked how I was doing. I said I would like a drink. He apologized for the wait for my drink. So after awhile he said another 5 minutes then I could order food. Long after 5 minutes I asked if I could order. He said he wasn't sure because the kitchen wasn't telling him anything. So he goes to investigate and reported another 20 minutes! Now I'm highly upset. He gave me a coupon for free hummus nachos that do not sound appealing. And I told him they do not. So I told him that the situation is ridiculous and I'm not paying for my lemonade. And I left.   I understand things happen that are beyond our control. I understand dealing with the public isn't easy. And the bartender was the messenger. That is why I waited for so long.  However the service was highly disappointing. Waiting nearly a hour to order food! I wonder what would've happened if I ordered food? Another hour? I hope Salut's management reads this review and informs staff this was unacceptable. I do not want heads rolling. This can be teachable moment of proper communication between the kitchen and wait staff. I'm giving one star because the host was friendly."}
{"text":"First time.   Went with my wife, vegan daughter, and veggie daughter.  Customer service was outstanding.  GM was great.  Food was really good.  The Sun Devil Burger is one of the best burgers I've had.  My wife sampled the bruschetta and loved here 4 choices.   Vegan had a modified hummus stuffed avocado (make sure you say you're vegan).  Veggie had a tasty, simple grilled cheese.  We were treated to s'mores at the table.  Outstanding experience.  Can't wait to try brunch."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great! Love the Decor. Best Happy hour spot! not what you would expect from a Tempe bar. The staff is always friendly. My Favorite hands down"}
{"text":"This place is great! Hard to find because it's a little off the beaten path in a strip mall, but we are so glad to have found it. The service from Gabbie was stellar. The servers, and manager Dave, were all friendly and very fun to talk to. Great selection of craft beers, bourbon, and whiskey. I suggest sitting in the patio, there is shade for the summer and heaters for the winter. Food is all very high quality and classic but with an unusual twist. Most definitely try the hummus nachos."}
{"text":"We had gone to Salut Kitchen Bar in a group and the evening started off fairly well. It was pretty much empty in the restaurant and we were seated immediately at the table that was reserved for us. After most of our party had arrived, our waitress came by to get our order for drinks and appetizers. We weren't initially going to order anything for starters but we ended up getting the Fried Mac & Cheese balls. They were pretty tasty but not worth the price. I think I probably would not get them again, but they were really crispy as I think they should have been and it was a good portion size; the sauce they came with wasn't anything special. We figured they were sufficient to hold us over since our waitress wasn't to be seen again for a while. We were also left without refills on drinks for quite some time.  Finally, when we flagged waitress over again, we put our entree orders in. I got the Brie Hive Sandwich with the Salut fries and my date got the Stuffed Bell Peppers, others in our party got a variety of different things. It took a really long time to get everything so we dug in as soon as the food hit our table! The sandwich was just okay, it was a grilled somewhat panini style but it wasn't browned on the outside so it was greasy. Salut fries weren't worth the extra cost either. They tasted a bit sour with the vinaigrette and they were also very soggy. I think my food might have sat for a little bit before it got brought out because it was on the lukewarm-cold side. The bell peppers on the other hand were pretty tasty. I'd say these are worth the order although again, when we got them, they weren't piping hot like we would have liked them.  Quite a few people at our table were hesitating but decided to put in an order for dessert. We were all trying to wait for everyone to finish up before leaving but after waiting for over half an hour, some of us had to take off to make it to our next destination. The desserts still hadn't arrived! I'm not sure how the restaurant justified bringing out everything so slowly, but we were just happy to get our checks and head out. Our server was nice and tried to keep up with the big group throughout the night. Because the food wasn't that great and there were such long wait times, I'm not sure I'd recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"We went on a Groupon but will definitely be back. Everyone at our table (a party of 4)was happy with their food. Admittedly, I started with the chicken and waffles. Th waffle was really good, however the chicken had no flavor so I sent it back and got the Malbec burger. And it was delicious. It's probably now my go to burger.  The mimosas were good, I've had better and I've had worse. I think it was the orange juice that made them not great, because they definitely did the job.  Our first server Riley was very pleasant, knowledgeable, and friendly. We were there so long that it was time for him to leave so we cashed out with him and welcomed Tyler. Tyler was AMAZING! We laughed so much and so hard. He was able to build a lasting report with us so that will most likely be calling to make sure he's working before we go. When you go, ask for his section he made an enjoyable meal memorable. The manager was also very accommodating with changing to the games that we wanted since of course we didn't all like the same teams. I honestly cannot say enough nice things about Tyler and how lucky Salut it to have him. Probably because as a said, the mimosas get the job done."}
{"text":"Service was friendly but pretty slow.  The hostess and servers were very friendly, but it took them 10 minutes to set up a table on the patio for 8 of us, even though the patio was pretty much empty at the time.  The food and drinks were good, but the appetizers specifically were a bit small.  I'll likely return for a Happy Hour, and hopefully when I do, it will be better."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service. DO NOT GO! came here for girlfriends birthday tonight and had to wait over hour for food and once it was brought out to everyone I was left without a meal until everyone had already finished their meals. I therefore didn't get to eat and received no compensation for my meal. On top of that my girlfriend ordered a salad side and never received it even though we were charged for it and had to refute it. The owner was present and still Offered no resolution. Will be telling friends and family to steer clear of this place!!!!"}
{"text":"This will be the second time that I have been in, the first time I had waited for ~5 minutes for a host/ess. I ventured in and found a server who had some free time and we talked about the restaurant, menu, and if I could do homework at this location. He was really nice and said it was encouraged. I went to the library and planned to come back another day.  So, today I came in. Luckily I'm a smart guy and learned from my previous experience and sought out the host/ess (I also saw a few other people waiting). It took an unusually long time for any kind of attention and I was contemplating going to Joe's crab shack for some Nachos but they don't have wi-fi so I waited for a while longer.  The server came after he greeted a table that came in a few minutes after I did. I don't think the hostess told our server we were here. Anyway, he got us our food and tended to a few tables. Checked up a few times. Jason (our server) and the busser were really good. The food was good but I wouldn't come back for it. The overall experience felt stressful, the staff were seemingly just running around to look busy. While walking in one of the staff was outside talking on the phone in another language and kept going back and forth for the entirety of our stay. He was constantly on his phone and almost caused a few collisions with the wait staff and bussers. The kitchen is loudly playing music that interrupts the vibe and music of the restaurant. Someone keeps skipping songs on the restaurants sound system (who even has time to deal with that?) It seems like a shit show that management should be on top of. Especially because it looks and feels like a nice place. It was probably meant to be, too bad."}
{"text":"Love the bottomless mimosas at this place on the weekend. Went there with some girlfriends and we had a blast. The skillet breakfast was also AMAZING, and I crave it all the time."}
{"text":"I met a former colleague of mine for drinks here. I loved the atmosphere. Very laid back and super friendly. Wine bottles were half off - score! I had the avocado hummus bowl and it was delish! The staff was very friendly. I would recommend this place for drinks or easy dining. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour, delicious burgers (I like the Malbec Burger), amazing Salut fries (with feta, herbs, citrus vinaigrette), lots of tasty small plate options and entrees, good service and a lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of friends on a Saturday night following an ASU game. The food was delicious and their craft cocktails are out of this world. I'm a firm believer that you can always judge a restaurant by the condition of their bathroom. Not only was the bathroom well kept, but it was one of cooler bathrooms in Scottsdale. The decor of the place was warm and they had a huge outdoor patio area. If you're in and around Tempe and looking for a laid back place to grab great cocktails, wine, beer or delicious food, look no further. I'll be back for their brunch next weekend."}
{"text":"We tried Salut this past Saturday for dinner. I have heard good things and all of them were true! We had the hummus nachos, bruschetta, and I got their butternut squash ravioli as my entree. The nachos came on crispy delicious pita chips, the bruschetta had great favors, and my ravioli was fantastic! Their drink menu is awesome too!  Our server (I wish I remembered his name) was fun and made the experience even better. I would definitely recommend Salut if you are ever in Tempe!"}
{"text":"This place is a a great gastropub right next to ASU. Excellent food and great service have made the place a regular stop for me. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Another great dinner! Took my sweetie for Valentines dinner and ate on the patio with perfect weather. The bacon bloody mary was awesome as well as the hummus appetizers.   Cheese sandwich, chicken shish ka bob, and Smores made for a beautiful evening. Attentive service, great ambiance - this is an oasis in the city and we can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great place to pop in for a small bite, smooth wine with a friend and your 4 legged best friend. The menu on Saturday was only brunch items which was not what I was needed after a night out with the girls and bf. However, it is not advertised for their food as much as the atmosphere and wine are so with that being said we had a good time. What really made up for it in my eyes is it's pet friendly! That alone sold me. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and made sure to place my to-go order when we got our food and not at the same time our food was delivered which is awesome! I hate when it comes out with our food and just sits there getting soggy and stale or when they don't even put it in at all! Kudos to you mister! Def coming back!"}
{"text":"We found out about this place with the elite restaurant dining app. My husband and I enjoyed lunch outside on the patio. I got the Malbec burger--so good! We also tried some of the house wine which was very nice as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Salut is one of my favorite spots! We went last night, walking in you feel welcomed. We were seated outside on the patio. We had a very well informed waiter. I had the pesto pasta and it was fantastic!  Great prices and even better service! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I reserved the patio for a Christmas Happy Hour Gathering on Friday December 2, 2016.  The event was such a blast!  Our servers Morgan and Tyler dedicated to our group were amazing, The servers were \"Johnny on the spot\" awesome! Also ensuring everyone had what they needed!  I must mention the food was excellent, prepared fresh, with a great assortment for the different pallets.  Tyler recommended the S'mores, which was such a hit, many of our Engineers had never had such a dessert. With great directions they were even successful in roasting the perfect marshmallow.   Employees are still talking about the great choice.  I highly recommend.    Chris"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Sunday. I was not very impressed with the food. The service was good unfortunately the food was not. There were six of us and only one person enjoyed their meal (quinoa pancakes). All of the eggs were undercooked and runny, yuck. The chicken and waffles was no good, chicken very dry.  The only plus was the bloody marys, they were pretty good. Overall, I would not recommend eating here for brunch."}
{"text":"I like how they have different drink specials every night and good food for fair prices with a hip atmosphere."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch and it was so good!  We ordered the hummus nachos and the Salut fries and WOW were they ever good!  I really enjoyed the hummus nachos - not what I was expecting but they were amazing.  We finished our meal with the pazookie cookie and it was better than the one you get at Oreganos.  We sampled a couple of their cocktails and they did not disappoint either.    I liked that they offered food for everyone as there were vegan/vegetarian options on the menu too - something for everyone who comes here."}
{"text":"Super cute atmosphere, awesome mules, great brushetta. Erin, our bartender, was super friendly and offered recommendations since it was our first time here. We had the chicken kabob and salad. The kabob came with some amazing hummus and fresh pita."}
{"text":"This place is great!! The happy hour menu is my favorite, you can get any one of their craft cocktails for $6!! Definitely a good place to take a date and get some drinks with friends!!"}
{"text":"There have been a few restaurants in and out of this location, and Salut is by far the best one! They have a great patio where you can bring your dog and enjoy the fresh air. The hummus nachos are amazing and could easily be the main course, because I want to eat 50 of them. The pistachio crusted salmon was wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone! I will definitely be back on a Sunday because they have 50% off bottles of wine. Otherwise, weekend mornings are best spent here enjoying brunch and BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS!!!"}
{"text":"This is a definitely a place that isn't on most people's radar but it should be. The hummus nachos is what they are known for and is a must. The salmon and the filet mignon were very tasty and their happy hour is great. Their servers are pretty attentive and charming too."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my wife. We both had just lost some weight so we want a celebration meal. We had the hummus nachos, she had the chicken sandwich a I had the Italian panini. Everything was delicious!  I'm not a huge hummus fan but thoroughly enjoyed the nachos. The staff was awesome as well. The waitress kept refilling our water and the bartender was very friendly. Highly recommended and we will return."}
{"text":"Great spot! Great Patio! Diverse and Delicious menu options! Great Service! The drinks were very good and average priced. The $18 bottomless mimosa is a great way to pass Sunday morning away. Booths were generous and comfy. The misting system and vine-hidden patio made busy University Drive virtually disappear. Tyler and Corey were attentive and entertaining servers. I highly recommend the Parmesan Lemon fries and the make-at-ur table s'mores were a perfect sweet ending."}
{"text":"Great service, diverse menu, good vibe and endless brunch mimosas...what more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is fantastic.   The atmosphere is incredible, the wait & bar staff are warm and friendly, they have a great mix of music playing, hell they even serve delicious cucumber water.   The food itself is incredible. Excellently prepared, creative entrees, and moderately priced.   I can't say enough good things about Salut. Stop thinking and go!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were looking for a dog friendly patio to have dinner with our friends when we came across Salut.  We decided to give it a try based on the reviews we read. This place gets two stars for the outdoor ambience only.  A table of 4 took 3hrs to move through dinner service with only 3 other tables in the entire bar on a Saturday night. the wine is way overpriced even for restaurant markup.  I looked up most of the wine on Vivino and they are selling $6.99 for more the 4x markup and is of the lowest rated wines on vivino averaging 3 stars.  The food was cold when received, wine pours will small at best, the vodka soda was flat and sent back and to top it off please look at the photo for their second try at making truffle fries.  They dumped the entire bottle of seasoning ruining the already room temperature fries. With so many more options in tempe marketplace steer clear of Salut."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here.  I've actually been here once before, for a larger 'holiday event' I organized for my company a few years back. It's been so long now that I can't review any of the specifics, but we had 12-15 people and received excellent service.  Fast forward to a few weeks ago and I wanted to have a farewell dinner with a co-worker and it needed to be near campus. I remembered Salut and she agreed with the menu. We arrived too late to enjoy the happy hour, but our waiter was really helpful in suggesting which wines to try and brought me samples of a few.  I had the grilled chicken pita with the mediterranean side salad. They were both delicious although the pita wasn't as healthy as I originally thought (a little on the greasy side due to the roasted/grilled vegetables), but it tasted great and was a large portion.  It wasn't busy when we were there (~7:30 on a Wednesday night), but even  still I thought the service was exceptional.  Icing on the cake? I was in Phoenix on business and my company requires receipts for expenses over $25 in order to be reimbursed. Well, I spent $34 that evening (with tip and one of the more expensive wines) and neglected to take a copy of the receipt. On a long shot, I contacted them through the generic form on their website and received a copy of the receipt within a few hours. Amazing customer service! Especially considering my visit was 2 weeks ago.  The patio looks great and I can't wait to go back to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, atmosphere, and service.  I've been to Salut several times and am always happy when I leave.  One improvement that could be made is the addition of entrees to the food menu.  The salads, sandwiches, and burgers are great but sometimes you want an entree instead."}
{"text":"First time here and was very impressed.  The bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly.  I mentioned my phone was going dead and he gave me a cord to plug in where there was a station for it.  I ordered a skinny Margareta which he didn't make before and was amazingly good.  The hummus nachos were extremely tasty.  We never really knew what this place was all about but after reading the menu we are going back for the smores and since its a dog friendly place we are bringing him to.  Its now our favorite bar and eatery."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were delicious, and Ravyn was an awesome server! We stopped in for a quick happy hour drink and appetizer befe heading out to another event. We said we were a bit limited on time, and Ravyn made sure our drinks and food came out immediately. Loved the Lavender Gin cocktail and the Hummus Nachos. I really want to come back for dinner because everything sounded amazing, an there were so many vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! My best friend and I met up for some post work drinks and had never been here. She ordered me the house wine that was on happy hour and delicious! We got there and everyone was super friendly and attentive. We started with the salut fries, which are AMAZING! Garlic fries with like parm on there. I had the salut burger and added a fried egg! It was to die for! To top off the visit one of the owners came out to greet us and asked about our experience. He ended sharing a but about his background from Greece. GREAT FOOD, DRINKS, and COMPANY!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and definitely will not be my last. A great place to go especially on a Wednesday late afternoon - night. I was very impressed with the food, the live music, and our wait staff Mariah was very attentive. The drinks were impressive. I had a Whiskey Smash and an Old Fashion (which knocked me off my chair). Their Nacho Hummus was just as good!"}
{"text":"In town for Spring Training and we like to avoid chain restaurants.  Found this place. Atmosphere was awesome, friendly quick service.  Food was incredible.  The Hummus Nachos and the Mac & Cheese balls are a must have!  Will be back next year!"}
{"text":"Was here for my first time in Phoenix and now again for my second time as I definitely wanted to come back here. David, the general manager, saw me at the table and remembered what table we were at and that I was with my mom (this was from this past CHRISTMAS!!). The bartender, Chief, was fast, friendly and very attentive. We are yet again very VERY happy with our experience here. Well done everyone. See youth is fall when it's not 120!! :)"}
{"text":"Salut is a fantastic restaurant. I have been there a few times and hosted a company party back in January. Craig, the Catering Manager, is a delight to work with. He's friendly, very accommodating, great with communication, and has an incredible staff. Every person there seems happy to work there and the services is top notch! The food is delicious, I have always enjoyed everything I have tried/eaten there. When we hosted our party, it was raining non-stop and we had booked the patio outside, however, it was covered so wasn't too bad of an evening being outside (plus who doesn't love the rain in Arizona), and Craig and his staff went above and beyond to accommodate our group (there were about 50 of us). He also gave us complimentary dessert for putting up with the rain. Highly recommend and I know a lot of ASU staff members who either get Salut to cater or hold parties there. Love this place and thank you, Craig, for taking such great care of my team!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Tyler was our server & gave the best friendly professional service ever! Loved the food n atmosphere too!!!"}
{"text":"Finding new places to eat when you are gluten free can be challenging.  The food was great.  The melon wrapped in prosciutto and the bruschetta I had was amazing.  I would definitely go back.    Would have been even better if I could have had a gluten free sandwich, but there were several options."}
{"text":"Bruschetta was good. Nice selection of wines, which is kinda important for a wine bar. Burger was tasty. Greek salad was disappointing. Music is hipster but pleasant. Decor is rugged + industrial; whatever it works.  Would absolutely swing by for some wine and an appetizer on a lazy evening. But would not pay more than happy hour prices. Portions are a little small and food is overpriced."}
{"text":"Came here because I had a gift certificate.  It is in a location that you would normally pass right  by while driving but dont! This place has a great patio, it is dog friendly too, the staff was nice and they have great specials. Monday night was a bottle of wine and Smores for $20 which is a great deal.  We had a bruschetta board and while it's kind of annoying that EVERYONE is doing these boards now, I have to say it was very good.  We also had a Madera Burger and this was NOT just a burger, it was cooked perfectly, the toppings all delicious and even the bun was good.  This is a place we will definitely come back to with the dog for brunch on the weekend."}
{"text":"I drove by this place once and thought it looked like a great place. And yes it was. The burger was excellent, a good recommendation from Alex. I will be back to try the fillet."}
{"text":"Really good food, it's a bit pricey for the gluten free bruschetta because it comes on little sand dollar sized crostini. I had to order something else to eat. They also had s'mores that you could make at your table which was super cool, but I would have like the option of a better chocolate than Hershey's. I get that they are probably trying to resurrect childhood memories but if you are paying top dollar, might as well class it up a bit.   I LOVE the cucumber water and the decor. And all the food tastes really fresh. My friend got a drink (grapefruit martini) and said it was tasty and strong."}
{"text":"The food is fine, the portions are a little on the small side for the price tag, the atmosphere is fine, but the service stinks. Period.   It took what felt like an eternity to get water, it took even longer to get an order going. It took even longer for the waitstaff to get our drinks right. We got appetizers AFTER entrees, and all we heard about these constant mixups and screws ups were excuses...\"ohh, the drink mix must've been out\", or \"ohh I'm sorry we didn't get that yet.\" But the best line we heard from our server about our MARGARITAS not showing up when we ordered them was \"ohh we had to make a new mixture of vodka stuff\", interesting, seeing as how a margarita is made with TEQUILA and not VODKA, but hey, who am I to question such things? Don't lie to guests, just make it right.   This place is so overstaffed with lingering staff doing nothing it's amazing that anything went wrong. With that many people around doing absolutely nothing you'd think it'd be smooth and our orders would come out right, but nope, orders came out at odd times, drinks were wrong, things were forgotten, and the service experience overall was a mess. Really crumby performance, sorry guys, it was weak. Tell your waitstaff that they have a job to do and doing it right matters, otherwise people get rubbed the wrong way. Shape up guys, your food is decent, just fix your service!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour should go until 7pm, but in this place it doesn't really matter. The prices of beer are in most cases lower for non-happy hour items. They charge $4 for a draft beer during happy Hour (unless you get Rolling Rock) and the domestic bottles are only $3 normally, so basically happy Hour pricing is useless. Another place that also picks and chooses what they want us to eat during happy Hour. They only decided to put four items on the HH menu. Most other dishes seem overpriced for a College area like Tempe. The patio is decent enough and one waitress should clearly be modeling something rather than slinging food to tables of college kids using daddy's money to buy expensive entrees."}
{"text":"Christie is such a great bartender and waitress.  Always takes care of us and does an amazing job.  My wife has celiacs and their kitchen is so great to separate our food.   Daytime is quiet and that's when we go most often but happy hour is great as well."}
{"text":"The food and service  here is bomb. Com. Very healthy,  plated nicely,  wonderful options. Came here for brunch also,  and was amazed,  Especially by the quinoa pancakes.  All of the servers are great.  Most of all, David the manager,  really goes the extra mile and cares about his customers and mashes sure they are happy!!"}
{"text":"Over priced! Had the grilled cheese sandwich and the maple syrup on it was disgusting, the wine was the best part!"}
{"text":"The brunch specials are awesome and the food is good. The wait time and the service leaves room for improvement but you can't beat penny refill mimosas! And their patio is dog friendly which is awesome for when the weather is nice!"}
{"text":"One of the best experiences I have had. I called and made a reservation for a party of 13 two days before for my birthday. I was first to arrive and was welcomed by all of the staff. They were so nice and the ambience of this restaurant was perfect to share with so many close friends. We had our own private area and our server did the PERFECT job of making sure we were all happy. I believe the general manager was there and he went above and beyond to make sure it was a great birthday experience. The drinks at this place are strong and delicious! And the food was super yummy. Every time we go to Karaoke right around the corner, we will definitely be at Salut Kitchen first. Thanks for such a great evening and making my birthday special."}
{"text":"I love this place. Staff is great, food is delicious and the bottomless mimosas on Sundays were great! I will definitely be returning. I had the Breakfast Pita and it was delightful. Can't wait to check it out during happy hour!"}
{"text":"A comedy of errors MADE RIGHT by management and staff  First the errors 1) missed reservation time by 20 minutes; 2) Waited 50 minutes for food to arrive after order; 3) served beef burger instead of turkey burger. Now for what this restaurant did right; 1) got apology from no less than 3 different people and a drink comp for missed reservation time; 2) apology from waiter and the owner for long food wait; 3) burger comp, price cut on rest of food, free appetizers on next visit, more sincere apologies; 4) Another free appetizer and apology from hostess on the way out the door. This is a textbook example of how a restaurant should handle customers when things go awry, and yes, at ALL restaurants things do happen, but it is how staff and management correct them that makes all the difference. I think the problems we experienced were due mostly the unexpected popularity of this restaurant and a crush of people at the time we visited. We will definitely be back to this restaurant for sure, they took a few bad things and turned them around and made the best of it. As for the food, well it was wonderful; the pistachio salmon was well prepared on a bed of orzo (barley) and the burger was prepared just right, the Greek fries could have used a tad more time in the fryer, but they had a great flavor with the feta and herbs on top. Keep up the good work Salut, this review would have been very different had you and your staff not stepped up to the plate."}
{"text":"Gotta love weekend happy hour...  The quinoa bites were delish was the lemon lavender fizz.  Service was great and on a Sunday night, we had pretty much had the inside to ourselves.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Try the hummus nachos. Friendly service and they have a dog patio."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! We were looking for a fun new place to try after a late night out on the town. I yelped bottomless mimosas, as they tend to help after a late night, and found this gem - only a hop, skip and a leap from where we live. Our server was phenomenal with menu suggestions, kept our coffee hot, our drinks full. The biscuits and gravy, as well as the the avocado and salmon were beyond delicious. Definitely suggest this place to anyone looking to have brunch/lunch. We will be back   Side note: They have a dog friendly patio!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and well presented. We came in with an expired coupon, not realizing the date was for a year ago lol, and the owner was more than happy to take care of us letting us use the coupon regardless. It was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This has to be the most inefficient place I've been.  After waiting 35 minutes for our order tonight we were told our order didn't print for the kitchen and it would be another 25 to 30 for dinner to arrive.  No they weren't busy!  This was our first visit and obviously our last."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have an awesome Irish Mule, to die for hummus nachos, and yummy hummus stuffed avocado. The staff is incredibly friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This is a perfect location to sit outside and enjoy Arizona's beautiful winter weather. Of course, you cannot sit outside without a delicious cocktail and they have plenty of them including the delightfully refreshing Lavender Lemon Fizz. Their craft cocktails are a bit pricey so go for happy hour when you get $2.00 off. In addition to cocktails, I believe all of their adult beverages were on happy hour. My colleague ordered the Cool Mule which he enjoyed and for a nonalcoholic option, my other colleague ordered a Strawberry, Raspberry Lemonade which was served in a tall, robust glass.   For food, we only ordered an appetizer but it was delicious! We ordered the smaller which came with Salut Fries, 3 Mac & Cheese Balls, 3 Hummus & Pita chips and the Caprese Salad (2 tomatoes and 2 pieces of mozzarella).   Lastly, the staff were super friendly and helpful with recommendations. The only bit of criticism is that our drinks were slow to come to the table, regardless of alcoholic or not.   Overall, great place! I would like to go again."}
{"text":"Love the people here and owners as well. Great to see non chain restaurants thrive. Perfect for business happy hours too. The hummus nachos are to die for! Oh and they are dog friendly which is like the icing on the cake :)"}
{"text":"The mixed drinks are fantastic. My husband won't stop talking about the drinks and it's been a couple weeks since we were here. The food is also very good. Outdoor seating was very enjoyable before it reached 115!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Salut.  I'd really like to make it my go-to dinner, or brunch spot, but every time I've been there I leave having had a mediocre experience.  The food has been hit or miss each time.  The only consistent dish has been the hummus nachos, which are fantastic.  I also really enjoyed their s'mores and wine special.  It's something fun, and different; great thing to do on a date night.  However, the main courses have always left something to be desired.  My best advice would be to make this your first stop during a night out with friends.  Order one of their unique cocktails, hummus nachos to share, then on to the next stop."}
{"text":"I love this place! Love the people! Love the food! David is amazing, be ready to sing along to the tunes-he knows them all!!"}
{"text":"One of the nicer places Tempe has to offer. They have a nice outside patio where you can bring your dogs. Food is good and unique. Nice vibe throughout the place."}
{"text":"Used Dealchicken for 2 wine flights and an appetizer. The mushroom ravioli was pretty good but the wines in the flight were pretty unspectacular for being a wine bar. There was a hair in one of our dishes. They comped the dish and gave more Salut Fries to compensate. The fries were actually pretty tasty with an interesting citrus sauce. Eat 'em before they're soggy! Their bruschetta is not Postino's and I'll leave it at that. Cocktail drinks weren't very strong. Overall, friendly service but food was nothing to write home about. Probably not worth a return visit for me."}
{"text":"I've just moved to Tempe from Arcadia, which has in my honest opinion THE BEST restaurants in the Valley.  So I've been trying to find my new favorites in my new neighborhood and Salut is really good.  The quinoa fritters were excellent as was the hummus stuffed avocado.  I'd like to go back and try some entrees as I only ordered a sandwich with fries.  That was good, but a sandwich is good in a lot of restaurants. Definitely going back for more!"}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend for lunch. It was DELICIOUS. I got the cocktail that had sprite and lavender and it was seriously amazing. For an appetizer we shared the hummus nachos and the mushroom ravioli. It was tasty!! For lunch we shared a sandwich (the one with Brie and something else) and got their salut fries, OMG!!!  EVERYTHING we ordered was delicious. This is our new fave spot. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Seriously deceiving groupon.  The service was good. The food was good. The place was cool.  I liked everything about it.  What I don't like is the deceptive groupon:  \"$32 for dinner for two (up to $59 total value)      Two craft cocktails     Two gourmet burgers or hot sandwiches with choice of Salut fries or greek salad\"  We ordered two cocktails $9 and $10 a piece, we ordered 2 paninis, one with the \"Salut\" fries\", $10 and $9 each. Plus an extra $1.50 for the unknown upgrade to Salut Fries (server didn't mention this or that the groupon would only cover the cheapest sandwich and cheapest drink option)  Being good grouponers we ordered extra: hummus nachos as a starter and an additional beer.  When it came time to pay we got $32.50 off our bill because of the groupon.  This is deceptive because wasn't my groupon for \"$32 for dinner for two (up to $59 total value)      Two craft cocktails     Two gourmet burgers or hot sandwiches with choice of Salut fries or greek salad\"  ??  *note that Salut fries are mentioned on the groupon!  I really liked the place. The hummus nachos were amazing and I'd like to go back. But this was just shady.  **also note the photo of their hummus nachos shows 6 triangles, we only received 5. At $9 it's delicious but I'd warn it wouldn't be a filling meal."}
{"text":"Went to have dinner here for the first time and was very, very happy we did. The food was so delicious and so satisfied. Our server Keary was awesome and extremely helpful and gave great recommendations. We will definitely be going back. Going to to try the brunch on the weekend!"}
{"text":"The Women Who Wine visited Salut Kitchen Bar yesterday. We had a lovely experience from start to finish.   Sunday's special is half-priced bottles, so the 6 of us shared a couple of bottles of one of my favorite Lodi, CA, Zinfandels, Klinker Brick, which is not all that common in wine bars.   Our server, Chris, an adorable cutie from Cypress, was attentive and helpful, even arranging for an extra portion of their signature appetizer, the hummus nachos. The nachos come in 5 portions, and there were six of us, so Chris went back to the kitchen and got us the extra at no charge. The appetizer was delicious too, with tasty hummus on toasty pita bread with pomegranate seeds, and some yummy balsamic reduction drizzle.  The prices were very reasonable, and for 6 of us sharing 3 bottles of wine, a very nice cheese platter and two of the Hummus Nachos, with a 20% tip cost us a mere $23 each.   The place is not far from ASU, and is obviously aimed at a younger crowd, but the manager was accommodating enough to turn down the music upon request. My only complaint would be the un-cushioned metal chairs, which were not all that comfortable for older lady bottoms and backs.   I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came to this place for some bottomless mimosas. Great atmosphere and the service was amazing. I think our servers name was Lainie and she was just a ball of fun! Great personality and top notch service. Must try the hummus nachos if you go they were delish. You should try this place if you haven't and be sure to ask for Lainie."}
{"text":"I've come here twice, once for brunch and once for dinner and both were pretty average experiences. The first time I came here was with my husband for brunch, I ordered the breakfast nachos which were quite tasty, but my husband's cinnamon toast crunch chicken & waffles fell flat. The chicken was pretty bland, and there was nothing really memorable about the waffle. Save the calories for Lolo's because it wasn't worth wasting on this dish.   The second time I came here was with some friends for dinner, we shared the hummus nachos, which like the breakfast nachos were delicious. For my main course I ordered the Summer salad which sounded way better on paper than it was. It was a spinach salad that included mostly spinach with a few measly toppings. Most of the bites I had were just spinach since the toppings were so chintzy. I also tasted my friend's brie and prosciutto panini, which was oddly bland considering those ingredients are typically full of flavor.  Can't say I will choose this place again, as there are plenty of other more tasty options in the area."}
{"text":"We had a great Sunday brunch here.  They took our reservation for 15 and had the table ready when we arrived.  Our waiter, Sam, was excellent.  We loved the food and had such a good time.  Definately will go back"}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal!!! The service was outstanding and the food to die for!! We picked it because I wanted a Bloody Mary! It was a great pick! David came to our table to check on us and when we expressed our delight with the food he promptly sent out the chef!  I had the grilled cheese and my man had the chorizo gravy and biscuits. I got not one but two fantastic bacon bloody Mary's and the skinny mojitos were yummy and refreshing!! Can't wait to do Sunday brunch here again!! If you haven't gone you gotta go!!"}
{"text":"I had a really great experience here and the menu was literally made just for me.  I had such a hard time deciding what I wanted because there were at least 6 entrees that caught my eye. I settled on the habanero vodka bolognese. It tastes amazing and has just enough heat. The bread that came with it was amazing.  We got the Yelp deal which was a $2 glass of wine to accompany our meal. And we got the amores for dessert. It was a great experience having what seemed like an eternal flame at our table. It was romantic and we sat on the patio because the ambiance was perfect. I highly recommend.  Our server was Kona and that guy was awesome. Give that man a raise! He is one of the most personable servers I've ever had."}
{"text":"Patio is extremely cozy, the staff was very accommodating to bring us a heater when we need it! Shrimp tacos and the hummus nachos and beet salad were fabulous great flavor perfectly prepared and presented.  Cocktail selection was a very good wide variety, and server Sierra was awesome. They even take a picture of your dog for the doggie wall! Warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"John P. Is great! Great food and wine. They have lots of different things on their menu and the salmon and amazing! They have lots of different wines and other drinks."}
{"text":"This might be Tempes best kept secret. Came here for brunch on a Sunday and we absolutely loved it.   Atmosphere: large patio with large opening to the inside. The inside has some seating as well of course. This is a dog friendly patio so feel free to bring your little friend along. For those of you concerned about that - it's very clean.  Drinks: Bottomless mimosas of course. I couldn't seem to find the price of it anywhere on the menu but just so you know, it's $18 per person. Our server was on point with filling them though. We got our money's worth.  The food. Amazing. Get the hangover fries. Holy hell they're bomb. She got chicken and waffles I got a burger. Both were very satisfied and left full!  The bill: $80 including tip. A little pricey for brunch for two people but worth it. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is MY favorite wine bar. My friend Hannah and I come in every 3-4 weeks and have for the past 3 years. Fantastic food and service. Definitely come in!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this great little restaurant. Food was outstanding. So was our server, Anna. Happy Hour prices are the best. Can't wait to try their brunch."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. This was our first time here,  visiting friends from Mesa, and they the staff was very accommodating for our party of 6. All the food was fantastic. I'd highly recommend the chicken and waffles and bacon bloody mary."}
{"text":"It is almost patio weather and it is safe to say that we'll probably be regulars here! Their patio is dog friendly, they have sports on the TVs, delicious food, great ambiance, lovely service, and pretty much everything that you could ask for! It has similar vibes to OHSO's patio but definitely not as crazy and packed with dogs.   We ordered the restaurant week menu on Friday and it was delicious! For $33 per person, you got a 3 course meal + a glass of house wine. It is hard to beat that! I ordered their strawberry spinach salad, the filet kebabs with chimichurri sauce, and their dessert was an orange-sicle cheesecake with raspberry sorbet on top and fresh strawberries. I also loved their house cab! My fiance got the hummus nachos topped with pomegranate seeds, balsamic, and feta - HOLY HEAVEN, so good! These are a must! ...and the salmon entree which he loved!   Thank you so much for an incredible date night, Salut! We'll absolutely be back again soon! Harvey {our sheepie} loved it too!"}
{"text":"Salut is great.  Really great.  I've had it bookmarked forever, and finally when a friend was visiting from St. Louis I suggested stopping here for dinner on Thursday night before we drove on up to the art walk in Scottsdale.    We had the hummus nachos to start, a delicious Old Fashioned for me, and a couple of glasses of house pinot grig for her.  She had something healthy like the quinoa bowl or something for her entrée...I don't know...I wasn't really paying attention because I had the malbec burger and that was perfect.  The burger was full of flavor and I think they must grind them up fresh because it was so moist and tender.  The bun holds up well, and with the shrooms, caramelized onions, and provolone, that was a fantastic burger!    Chris was our server, and when we were trying to guess where he was from due to his accent, I finally just asked him.  He said, \"Cyprus\", and oh my God, my dining companion then just started talking to him in Greek and they had a whole back and forth thing.  I had no idea what they were saying, but it was pretty cool to witness.  He said he rarely runs into someone he can converse with like that.  I didn't want to tell him she only learned Greek to meet men on her vacations!  BAHAHAHA!  I'm just kidding.    No I'm not.  She has a boyfriend on every island.  So then I had to take my Mr. back this morning for brunch.  It just doesn't get much better than this for sure.  We started with the hummus nachos, because you should, you really should.  He then had the Morning burger and I ordered the chicken & waffles.  We went halvsies on everything and it was a great brunch.  I think their burgers might be the best I've had in this city so far.  It's a close contest between them and Fibber Magees/Skeptical Chymist's rasher burger.    A medium rare juicy burger with cheese, bacon, AND an egg?  Yep.  Heaven!  The waffle was so nice and light, perfectly fried chicken, and the cinnamon butter with the syrup is a nice touch.    He had a tripel and I had their coffee, which was fantastic as well.  Lovely, rich flavor.  That brunch is leaving me fat and happy for the entire day.  I can't wait to go back.  Chris was our server again today and he is really wonderful.  Attentive and funny without hovering over us too much.    The only thing I don't like is the music tends to have a lot of thumping bass, and I just don't care for that.  Especially at the end of a long day, after dealing with my high maintenance boss, I really don't want dance music thumping in my brain.  And the music was a little aggressive at brunch.  I think that belongs after 9:00 p.m. when the youngsters are all coming out, and the old men who like to hit on youngsters, and they are looking for someone to rub up against for the night.  Not really the right music for brunch or happy hour in my opinion, BUT that won't keep me away.  Stellar place!  Now that we've been, we'll be back many more times."}
{"text":"My first visit here all I had was the bruchetta and it was average. My second visit was for New Years. For being extremely busy, the servers were really on top of everything and made the experience pleasant. We started with the Bacon Brussel Sprouts and the Caprese Salad. Both were good but we prefered the brussel sprouts. For dinner I had the seafood pasta and my husband had the short ribs. The pasta was great but the ribs were dry and had a weird after taste. We ended with the tiramisu. All it was lady fingers dipped in coffee, covered with cool whip for about  $60 a person they could have put a little more effort into it.  Overall the experience was average."}
{"text":"Lauren and I love this place. Super dog/pet friendly patio. Excellent environment and the staff is amazing. We sat inside at a table close to the bar.   We were greeted by Will who turned out to be the Manager and Raven was our server. Will made us feel incredibly welcomed. Raven was very personable and took care of us very well. She did an outstanding job. The absolute best service anyone can ask for. We had a delightful evening.  We got a Hummus Nachos accompanied with a bottle of Chateau La Paws Red Blend to split. Lauren got a Salmon cooked to her specifications and I got the Habanero Vodka Bolognese. The food was so amazing. I still say my dish was better than hers . We are coming back for another date night for sure."}
{"text":"The Malbec burger is a game changer! So flavorful and cooked to perfection! This place is a hidden gem. Taso, one of the owners came over and made sure we enjoyed our experience! I highly recommend this establishment if you are on a first date or if you have been married for 20 years! Very friendly atmosphere and even has a dog-friendly patio. Ask for Katie, she will definitely make sure you have amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group for dinner. Ordered the appetizer sampler, quinoa/spinach salad, and a burger.  The sampler for $19 was woefully overpriced as was the quinoa salad which very blah and had a bit too much onion.  They get good stars for a lot of vegetarian/vegan options, good service, and a dog friendly patio.  Our server (female) was very patient and sweet. She happily rang up our bill based on what we had instead of giving us one bill for 16 people.  Good in concept but overall, I would not go back based on the food (taste/quality/value)."}
{"text":"Dog-friendly outdoor patio! Need I say more?!   This place was super cute! Visited on a Sunday night and the ambiance was nice and pleasant and service was excellent. Loved their mood music too! Visiting on a business trip from Las Vegas, and I found this little gem on Yelp through the locator. Very pleased with the results! I had their hummus nachos and Salut burger (beef). Both were great! Hummus nachos, basically a small mound of hummus on a quarter slice of pita bread, and very tasty might I add. Heard a lot about this place since, and glad I got to visit on my trip here to Phoenix! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Salut -- aka \"greetings\" or as I like to think of it, \"cheers!\" This place will definitely have you clinking glasses together and saying \"salut!\"   The place is not where you'd expect it to be, but definitely a gem. I, for one, absolutely LOVED it here! The ambiance is very relaxed yet friendly and welcoming. (I hate to name drop/compare it to another restaurant, but walking in definitely reminded me a bit of OHSO or The Vig -- although being compared to two great places isn't a bad thing, right?) I love that it has a dog-friendly patio with plenty of comfy seating (if you're lucky enough to get a booth), and if you can't rip yourself away from the game for a few hours (or coming in to watch a game), there are TVs both inside and on the patio.   Started off the evening with the Lavender Lemon Fizz -- oh.em.gee! I've had Lavender added to coffee before which was divine, but this just took me to a whole 'nother level. It was perfectly sweet with a subtle hint of lavender and refreshing lemony flavor. (side note: you cannot taste the alcohol in this drink, so pace yourself -- 'cause you'll be drinking and then all of a sudden, BAM! Gotta call an Uber).   As far as food, we ordered Truffle Fries to start (recommended by our amazing server, whose name started with a \"C\" but I can't remember it. *sorry*). They were extremely flavorful and seasoned just right, with the right amount of \"crisp\" to them. I recommend ordering some, for real though. And then for my main course, I opted for the Quinoa Bowl with chicken -- mouthwateringly delicious, satisfying and filling; but not that \"omg I ate too much\" feeling, it was just right. My friend got the Salut Burger, which, honestly, it took every ounce of strength in my body to not jump across the table and devour that burger... it looked and smelled so good. Next time I'll get a burger, for sure. Yes, there will definitely be a next time... and probably many more times after that. All in all, it was a great evening! Thanks, Salut! Oh, and p.s. please open more locations across the valley."}
{"text":"We had our company's holiday party here, and the service was AMAZING! The ladies were always there to help us and refill our drinks! We had a group of about 30 and they gave us the entire patio! So nice.   The food was a little lack luster though. The Mac & Cheese Balls needed flavor and the pita \"nachos\" were good, but had way too much humus on them.   We didn't order any enters, so I can't really give an all around review, but from what I experienced I would definitely come back by myself, or schedule another event there."}
{"text":"We loved the bottomless mimosas and the gluten-free options made it very easy for our group. Glen, our server (who was working on Easter), was beyond helpful and so engaging. We would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I came for the $5 grilled cheese and rolling rock special. It was definitely worth the money. Additionally, we had a coupon for free hummus nachos. The nachos were okay but not what we expected.  I probably wouldn't order them again. The grilled cheese was good and really big for being so inexpensive.   The most impressive thing about the restaurant was the atmosphere. Even though it is on a busy road, you feel like you're in a secluded area. It has a trendy feel that I really liked.   The service was good but the waiter was slow with the check. This wasn't an issue because I wasn't in a hurry, but if I were it would have been frustrating.   I'm looking forward to returning for happy hour and to try the s'mores!"}
{"text":"I visited Salut again last Friday with a group of friends. It was my first time back since a previous bad experience. The atmosphere did feel different, better, and the food was fantastic. I got the stuffed bell pepper. The salad that came with that was absolutely fantastic. I've found myself craving that salad multiple times since then. The service was just right. Not intrusive, but there right when you needed her.  You have done an excellent job under the new management ."}
{"text":"Fun celebration dinner with family. Glen was a great server. He helped make the evening perfect. Loved the Salut fries, wine and grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Yummy food and fun servers! The patio is a cool place to hang out. Happy hour is pretty rockin, 1/2 off bottle of wine, bucks off starters, and 2 off beer, Until 6:30."}
{"text":"Salut has a nice Happy hour and makes good cocktails. However, my review is more for the brunch. They have a dog friendly patio and 1 cent additional mimosas as the brunch special. Not only that but the breakfast food was good quality and came out in a timely manner, I haven't had to wait in a ridiculous breakfast line to get food, and the patio is just so nice to enjoy with some sprinkles of sunlight and gentle murmur of the fellow patrons enjoying brunch there. The service took a little bit of time and has been hit or miss the 2 times we have been, but all in all quite a nice experience and will be back!"}
{"text":"Fresh and fabulous food at Salut. A fun atmosphere, good music, big screen tv fir sports, plus a dog friendly patio. Creative appetizer menu. Deep fried mac and cheese bites, yum. Pistachio crusted wild salmon,  lemon orzo, grilled asparagus, oh, so good! One of our favorite restaurants. Our waiter, Kona, took good care of us. Excellent."}
{"text":"Enjoyed having Tyler as our server today for Brunch.  Not only did he make great food suggestions but he was not short of keeping our bottomless mimosas re-filled. Our dining experience was topped off with his pleasant sense of humor ! PS the breakfast pita was excellent too"}
{"text":"Always on the quest to look for a great bottomless mimosa deal, so last Saturday my husband and I decided to give this place a shot.  Very dog friendly as I noted on the wall of photos of patron's dogs, I should bring my pug here at some point.  Small-ish inside dining, ample patio dining.  Our bartender (Cheif?  Can't remember his name :-() was excellent.  Engaged in conversation with us much of the time spent there - less than 2 hours.  If he reads this, we're the ones that told you about the Death Star ice cube mold that you can buy on Amazon :-)  Food was good, shared the hangover fries and the deep fried mac n cheese balls.  Was actually enough food for us.  Okay, so mimosa time - it was $18 bottomless mimosas with penny refills.  They pour OJ from the gun into a pitcher and top off with Andre/Wycliff champagne.  I would prefer to add my own OJ to my mimosa as I'm very champagne heavy on my drinks.  Downside really was that, and the drinks just weren't cold enough, thus us only sticking around for a couple of hours.  Staff - please make the mimosas COLDER and let us have a carafe of OJ to add our own?  If so, we'll definitely be regulars!"}
{"text":"We wanted to use a Groupon that included 2 flights of wine and a shared plate.  They refused to honor the Groupon because it was during their happy hour.  The Groupon isn't for a dollar amount so why does it matter??  I actually made the trip out there before learning of this since they didn't put this restriction on the deal so I was very unhappy.  The food was actually decent, and I wish I could have had some wine with it.  I could see how it could have went well together.  However, I was not going to pay a cent more than I needed to satiate my hunger at this point.    I will say though that there was a piece of lint/animal hair in the hummus nacho plate and there were a couple of flies that we couldn't get rid of so I have to say that I'm not sure about the cleanliness of the establishment.  The service was great, but its such a shame that the manager in charge at the time was so unreasonable about the Groupon deal.  Their hours are so limited during the week so really you have about an hour window to use this for dinner unless you want to eat late.  I try not to eat past 7pm so this Groupon is pretty much dead to me."}
{"text":"Kori and Will amazing hosts.they were tentative and made sure we had what we needed.the food was amazing and the service even better. I'm glad we came here"}
{"text":"I'm in town from Denver and came here with my cousin for lunch and drinks. The place was virtually empty, and I'm not sure why! The good was pretty good, drinks were on par with most bars/restaurants, and the service was friendly. I'm bummed we missed the weekend brunch - seems like a great deal!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regulars here! For brunch, I usually get the Chorizo Eggs Benedict or the hangover fries. Delicious! If I'm feeling less breakfast-y, I'll get the beet salad or the chicken sandwich (I always ask for extra sauce). My boyfriend loves the Bacon Bloody Mary's.The patio is dog friendly and a great place to spend a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Such nice staff!!  Brought my mom here and they opened the patio for us and my dog. Great menu, light stuff and also nice hearty stuff as well! Had the salut burger with truffle fries and the salut fries (YUM)!! Love the vibe of the place and everything they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Chief was my bartender tonight and he surpassed all expectations tonight as he muddled those drinks with such passion! I was especially impressed with his soon to come signature drink called the lonely island. He Is extremely charismatic and you can tell that he loves his job. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Inside ambiance was lovely with tables and upscale type bar but seating was a bit tight.  Outside patio accommodated larger parties and was comfortable with heaters for cooler nights and shade for hotter temperatures.  Even though very close to ASU campus it felt more of a date night or ladies night out wine bar then a college hangout.  Food was good and service friendly.   Generous happy hour every day until 6:30pm.   Nice alternative to the busy Culinary Dropout or Mill Ave spots.  Would recommend to friends and look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Byanka is amaze balls. She knew exactly what to recommend, given our sharing needs. We split the bacon grilled cheese and truffle fries. Killer aioli! Bacon was thick cut and delicious. Lavender Fizz was worth every penny- large and in charge, not too sweet with a subtle finish."}
{"text":"5 stars for the atmosphere, the people, the drinks, and the food. I sat at the bar during happy hour and asked the bartender for a recommendation.  The white wine Todd suggested was crispppp. The salad was fresh and delicious! Yummy. The atmosphere here is relaxing and everyone is so friendly. I am coming back!! LOVE IT HERE!"}
{"text":"Great local place! Stopped in here for Sunday dinner because we were traveling with our dog. Very dog friendly, spacious fun patio with TVs. Our server was incredibly nice and helpful. He recommended the hummus nachos, which were so different and delicious. Not very big, though, so get two orders. We also enjoyed the variety of Moscow mules.   I wish we lived there because I would have taken a tub of hummus to go.   Would definitely go back. We felt like family."}
{"text":"Service was very good. Super friendly server. The mac n cheese bites aren't very good at all. Everyone else at the table really enjoyed their food. Pitas looked delicous. Dog friendly patio accompanies the cute wall of dog Polaroids. Very sharp wooden shelf in the bathroom actually cut my arm a little. Cocktails are good as well. I would come back here, but I would be cautious when going to sit down in the ladies room."}
{"text":"I am torn on this one.  Food wise it is THE BEST restaurant I have been to in quite a long time.  I loved the ambiance of the couch booths outside and the food and even the wine was delish.  The part I am torn on is it felt sleezy in the used car lot vibe.  First off there are chalkboards out front advertising happy hour $1 bottles of wine.  Same thing on the front of the menu.  (Actually it is also listed that way on the front page of their website.) I actually asked as soon as I sat down if that was a joke.  I was informed you buy a bottle at regular price and the second is $1.  You have to ask or turn over your menu to see that detail.  No asterisk, no small print, nothing.  Is that even legal advertising?!  Second we had a groupon for 4 flights of wine and 2 tapas or bruschetta plates.  The wine was the first to come out.  We were told they were a chardonnay, a merlot and a cabernet sauvignon all from a vineyard in California.  We first tried the white wine and enjoyed it.  Surprised that it tasted like no chardonnay we had ever had we asked with the menu which chardonnay from CA it was.  The waiter left and came back and told us that actually he was wrong and the flight wines are all tap wines from a barrel made in Tuscon?!?!  What is tap wine?  Third when we got our bill only one appetizer was taken off.  When the waiter was informed of the mistake he argued a bit that the groupon was only for one appetizer.  He had to take the coupon out of his pocket to inspect it again.  Then he left and came back having taken off the $4 fries we added on later instead of the $7 Hummus nachos that we had originally ordered as part of the deal.  I pointed it out again and he gave some excuse about timing and the computer taking off least expensive items.  Whatever!  Now onto the food... I had: Hummus Nachos - HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Greek Fries - VERY GOOD! Halloumi Bruschetta - Tasty with a relish/pickled flavoring Grilled Filet Mignon - AMAZING! Wilted Greens with Bacon - Good.  Parmesan French Toast with Tomato Basil Relish - MMMMM... the tomato basil relish was spicy in a sriracha flavored way  My friends tried the Bee Hive sandwich.  One really liked it and one liked everything except the thick sliced prosciutto.    I'm hesitant to go back.... but the food is calling to me... what to do... what to do..."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment!  We stopped in for brunch a week ago and sat on the pet friendly patio with our furry friend.  The service was quick, but the website and menu are very misleading!    I was craving the Oreo Pancakes after seeing them on their website and reading their description on the menu.  When they arrived, they were regular pancakes with Oreo cookie crumbles in them with a side of syrup...what???  The description says cocoa based pancakes with butter cream filling, white chocolate and caramel with Oreo crumbles...how does what I was served come even close to the picture on their website or this description?  EPIC FAIL!  Just a tip...please update your menu and your website to represent what you are actually serving!"}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosas for Sunday brunch. $18 for the glass with penny refills. Mimosas were served in a wine glass.First round our glasses were less than half full. On the refill they filled the glass. We got the mimosas right away but waited over fifteen minutes for the waitress to take our order. Service could have been a little better."}
{"text":"Aside from the great food was even greater service. From the moment we walked in we were greeted by 3-4 members of the staff. Made to feel very welcome and the bar tender was incredible. Asked us if we'd ever been there which we said no, so she proceeded to buy us their famous hummus appetizer! Yes I said BUY it for us! Then was super attentive and brought us things we didn't even realized we needed! Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! Prices are super reasonable, if not super cheap. They have an amazing happy hour, which lasts forever. Not really, but, you get my drift. I had a salad and a couple of drinks and was treated like a normal human being, which was a first while I was in Arizona. They have fantastic specials on PBR as well, and from what it looked like, stumbling distance from the dorms. We came the morning before a Spring Training game and  it wasn't super slammed either. It was about a 6 minute drive to the Cubs ballpark as well, so, I couldn't find a single bad thing to say about the place. Definitely coming back next year for Spring Training."}
{"text":"We went here because I had bought a Groupon.  I am so glad that we did.  The food and service were great!  We started with a couple of cocktails and the Humus Nachos (based on other reviews).  Yum!  My wife had a grilled sandwich and I went with a burger.  We each enjoyed our choices.  One thing that we did not care for was upgrading our fries to \"Salut Style\"    We finished things off with Smores for two.  All and all it was a great dinner and we look forward to coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Perfect little place for Sunday Fun-day! Great staff, bruschetta, and rescued wine bottles transformed by a local company into water glasses!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. Not a kid friendly place but great for group of friends. The fries are amazing so was the burger. The cucumber water was great I've never had it before and am craving it all the time now."}
{"text":"My husband and I had visited once before when they first opened.  We were not particularly impressed but we wanted to return because they were new then and we wanted to give them time to figure things out.  We enjoy drinking and truly appreciate the talent behind a craft cocktail.  We were elated to see a craft cocktail and wine bar in Tempe.  I had the Lavender Lemon Fizz and it would have been a great drink with much less lavender syrup.  He had the Manhattan which specified on the menu that it came with Carpano Antica sweet vermouth.  It did not.  It also said it came with an Amarena Cherry but it was just a maraschino.  Craft cocktail descriptions and classic Mill bar execution.  Decorations and atmosphere are great and food has been good each time, but drinks are lacking.  Would return, but would have to switch to wine or beer."}
{"text":"First of all let me say that the staff there was very friendly. I think that the restaurant is great for people that are not gluten-free. Unless you just want salad and small portions of meat, that's pretty much the only gluten-free options they have. I got the steak it was actually very good. They have no gluten-free sides except greens and no substitutions for their sides that they had. There potatoes had gluten and everything else was regular pasta. So they offered spinach. I got my steak one side was mixed greens the other side was raw spinach. So basically a small 4 ounce steak with a bunch of greens. I sent the spinach back to have it sautéed because that many greens is not appetizing to me. The spinach was OK and I did not touch the greens because the waitress had suggested I get a salad on top of my entrée because of the substitutions. So basically I had a bunch of salad. Again not for the gluten free. Very limited options. My husband got the burger and of course they have no gluten-free bun. Disappointing that it is listed as gluten-free options. I guess they did offer gluten-free graham crackers as substitution for their Smore's dessert. But that's it. I should've went to Picazzos"}
{"text":"Salut is a pleasant surprise on the corner of an unassuming complex in Tempe.   The patio is spacious and welcoming, especially for those who dine with their dogs. Any restaurant that asks to meet my pup and take a picture to put on the wall instantly gets my seal of approval! I will warn you though that if you have a sound-sensitive pet, the traffic noise from University can be a little frightening for them.  The interior of the restaurant is modern and clean, pairing well with their menu of fresh options. I'm a big fan of their creative and filling bruschetta boards.  If you're looking for something a little more mature than the typical college town joints, don't overlook this spot!"}
{"text":"I come here regularly for brunch. Interesting brunch menu, with a mix of basics and more unusual fare - a great omelet with chorizo, quinoa pancakes, eggs benedict with spinach and prosciutto. It's the bottomless mimosas that lure me here. We've had Jean Pierre as our server a couple of times, he's very friendly, attentive, and keeps the mimosas coming. A cute bar and booths inside, and a nice covered patio that is pretty pleasant even when the temperatures warm up. Televisions inside and out, but not obtrusive. Relaxed setting, just a great place to waste a Sunday morning. They used to have live music but haven't lately - hopefully, they bring it back. It added nicely to the ambiance."}
{"text":"I love this place! This is a hidden gem in Tempe! Finally a place w class and good taste!! Amazing cocktails, ammaaaaazing burgers, and amazing service!!! I moved to Tempe from Scottsdale and have found it very difficult to eat out here but this place has everything I'm looking for in a culinary experience. Highly recommend it!   Edit: I found after I went home that this place sells a $15 Pinot noir for $38!!! And their fresh squeezed orange juice which is $12 a carafe is actually minute maid poured into an unnamed container. Food is good but now that I've explored more wine bars, I'd say this one is really falling behind."}
{"text":"I've got to say I absolutely LOVE this place. The service, and food are amazing on their own, but the drinks? Oh good lord. The bartenders here blow these other chumps I'm Tempe out of the friggin water. They are all beyond friendly and happy to hold a long chat with you, and their mixing skills are definitely on point. This is definitely my go to place if I don't feel like lowering my standards for a drink."}
{"text":"This place keeps me coming back for the deliciously inventive food creations and exciting cocktails.  Not to mention their extensive list of wine and cold beer. I've been there with large groups and small parties and every time we are attended to in the utmost hospitable manner. Plus, having a dog friendly patio makes it easy to grab a cold beverage after a nice long walk. When I'm in town it's my go to spot. Thanks to management and staff for always accommodating us and making us feel so special."}
{"text":"interesting menu, pretty eclectic.  there for lunch and it was pretty quiet but I expect it rocks out with the college crowd in the evening.  had the cobb salad which was pretty good, blue cheese was tasty.  friends had their special fries with their burgers and didn't care for them."}
{"text":"Great place!  Loved the atmosphere and the staff was great!  The GM even cane up abs asked how everything was and then sent us over their #1 dessert (fire side smores), at no charge. Can not wait to return to this establishment!"}
{"text":"I checked out Salut at the suggestion of a friend, inviting several coworkers along for happy hour. We came in at a time that wasn't overly busy and were very pleased, given the heat, to be seated inside. They had some wonderful specials, and the casual atmosphere was just what we were looking for. One of their specials, buy a bottle of wine, get another for $5, turned out to be perfect for the group of us to share! They also offered a variety of \"bites\", which serve about 2-4, for $2 off. We ordered 4-5 of them and shared them around... I loved them all, but was an especially big fan of the Mac N Cheese bites and hummus nachos. (Don't expect the servings to be large - they're like tapas.) The service was very helpful and kind, and we also enjoyed the music that came in around 6! We'll certainly be back for more happy hour adventures here, and I'm excited to check out the \"1-penny refill mimosa brunch\" they advertise on Sundays! Yum :)"}
{"text":"Really bummed!! Yelp reviews made me want to try everything! We were staying at a nearby hotel and had our shuttle give us a ride to this place to find out they weren't serving food even though the hours posted were until 12:00 am on Saturdays & we arrived at 11:20 pm. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Oh wow!  Glad we chose!  Initially came for the dog friendly patio, stayed for great happy hour from 3 - 6:30.  Definitely try Salut fries and hummus nachos!  Mules are tasty.  Tony, the dog, loved the atmosphere and the ability to come in with us."}
{"text":"Have driven by this place multiple times and finally decided to go in with my girlfriend for happy hour. Todd was are bartender and he was amazing! He was crazy busy and was still pumping out amazing drinks!! The lavender lemon fizz and whiskey smash are to die for!! Also you have to get the hummus stuffed avocado it will change your life."}
{"text":"They have an excellent happy hour with 1/2 off bottles of wine. This is our 'go to' place on Friday night. The lovely patio setting is great for large groups or parties. Inside it's smaller but still they have a large bar area with great mixologists. The service is great too! Love this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the Malbec burger, Salut frys, and an Arnold Palmer.  Cons:  -Super soggy burger bun -A half nickel-sized (what seemed to be a) piece of cardboard in my fries..see pic I posted. I would have normally asked for a manager but I just got done packing and didn't feel like dealing with that. -Questionable sanitary conditions after seeing the piece of cardboard(?)  Pros: -good tasting burger..without the soggy bun -good tasting fries..errr, sans cardboard -gorgeous patio with this weather, surrounded by pomegranate trees  Service? Asi asi. Friendly, although stack of plates was never bussed."}
{"text":"Had the lavender lemon fizz and beer and chorizo (with fries instead of potatoes). Both on point! Service is super friendly and timely! Super dog friendly gave my puppers a few treats!"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour (1/2 off bottle of wine daily) and great atmosphere. I love this place and come here regularly.. like once a week. I usually only sit at the bar or occasionally the outside patio. The owner Tassos is so genuinely friendly and will remember you each time you come in if you talk with him once. He is always there too.   The employees are all truly happy to be there. Nicole, kona, chief, Riley, and Will are absolutely incredible. They are the \"above and beyond\" type that are the reason I have become a regular. I'm sure the others are great but I haven't interacted with them. I had Ashley as my bartender once and she was a dud. Totally ignored me and I had to have someone else (an assistant manager) offer to get my drinks as she helped others who sat down after me. Whatever, one poor bartender won't spoil this place and it's other amazing employees for me.   As a side note the giant patio is dog friendly! I love me some doggies."}
{"text":"My fourth visit at salut and as always-excellent.  The bartender, Nathan,  served up an amazing bacon Bloody Mary and a strawberry jalapeño margarita.  Both of them were so flavorful and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Every time I have been here the food and drinks were amazing, noise level is really loud, never impressed with any of our servers, until we got Cole, he was amazing!"}
{"text":"Lovely gem tucked away in a strip mall with an amazing dog-friendly patio! All of their food is delicious has a unique twist that won't disappoint. If you plan ahead, join their email list and they'll send you a coupon for a free hummus nachos appetizer- so good! They have great prices on drinks during happy hour and offer bottomless mimosas for $18 on Saturdays and Sundays. The restaurant is decorated very cute and the service never disappoints."}
{"text":"My new favorite place in Tempe!  This place is unreal such a great vibe and amazing service.  I tried the hummus nachos which I recommend highly!  The salmon was cooked perfectly and the Lemmon fizz craft cocktail was the perfect finishing touch. Great patio as well will be back soon."}
{"text":"My fiancé and i have tried this place a couple times, but both times we've had our order delivered to us wrong and paid too much for a dissatisfying meal.  I ordered a burger, medium well without one ingredient that was listed on the menu and a side of ketchup. When my burger arrived it was rare,  missing the ketchup and with the peppers I'd asked them to leave out.   The waiter and rest of the staff i met were very kind and I watched as the waiter typed in my order so I don't think the blame was on him. But the kitchen obviously didn't care enough to get my order correct, kinda frustrating to go to a restaurant, pay $50 for a meal, and then leave hungry because your food was wrong.  Won't be returning, I've given them enough chances."}
{"text":"Love this place! Nice spacious patio seating and pet/kid friendly restaurant. Staff and manager were super nice. Thanks so much Chris and David!   Ordered the quinoa bowl, which was so delicious and highly recommended! The Mac and cheese balls that were deep fried were phenomenal!   Great place to meet up w friends or a date night w your better half!   Highly highly recommend! We'll be back!!!!  Safe travels back home to Greece, Chris!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we will definitely be back.  The food was delicious.  The quinoa salad was super fresh and every bite was tasty.  The cowboy omelette was filled with chorizo and bacon, so yummy.   The hangover fries were awesome.  Definitely order them.   The service was on point.  Alley even got a piece of bacon, on the dog friendly patio, that also had the NFL ticket.  Tyler was our waiter and he was very helpful and nice.  He recommended the quinoa bowl and it was flavorful and delicious.  Alley gives him 5 out of 5 stars for friendliness and puppy talk.  We used a groupon and got $59 value from it.  Groupon is a great way to try out this restaurant.  It has something for everyone."}
{"text":"*Review based on initial experience/service and not food.  I came here last night (Monday) to celebrate my roommates birthday. We took a look at the menu/reviews prior to coming and thought we would try it out. Came in around 7pm and there were two customers at the bar and no one else seated. We were greeted right away and told to sit anywhere. We chose a booth and were served waters right away. The man who sat us and brought the water said our server would be right with us. The server was to be the bartender. The bartender was on the phone so we sat and waited.  About 10 min went by, we had our orders in mind and he was still on the phone and hadn't been to the table yet. The initial man was just kind of hanging out by the bar area. We were starving at this point we just decided to go somewhere else.   I still want to try this place out one day because the reviews are pretty good but last night didn't work out because we were hungry and kind of bummed about the service."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Salut: amazing food, drinks, atmosphere, service, AND a dog friendly patio. The hummus nachos are delicious and the bruschetta is incredible as well. I loved literally everything about this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We loved this place!! We will for sure be returning soon. Raven treated us amazing. Check it out you won't regret it. Don't forget to check in and get you $2 glass of wine."}
{"text":"Suffering from a late night craving for something sweet, S'mores in particular. I found a article that said this was one of the top 5 places for S'mores in Phoenix. I haven't tried the other 4 places. But so far this one gets my vote for the best. What makes it so good is you, you actually get to make the S'mores right at your table. The server brings you a plate with Hershey's chocolate, marshmallows, and graham cracker. And a little tiny flame burning stove to roast the marshmallows on! The only problem I see is if a couple a drunk people act all crazy once they order that dessert. I could easily see a drunk person throwing a burning marshmallow on another person.  We didn't get a chance to try any of the entrees there. We ate somewhere else earlier but we was craving something sweet and this did not disappoint. I will for sure go there again just for the dessert. The menu also looked like they had some good food as well."}
{"text":"Slooooow service and no one is hardly even here.  Weird menu.  Couldn't find anything that I recognized so I ordered a dessert. Would not come back here Again. Terrible music also.   Still waiting for our food ,,.."}
{"text":"My first time here was Valentine's Day, and surprisingly, it wasn't very busy. The hostess kept disappearing and it took us nearly 20 minutes to be seated (when they told us the wait was barely 10). The server took their time taking our order, however; the food definitely made up for the poor service. Everything my boyfriend and I tried was amazing! We came back about a month later (hoping that the hostess incident was a flook), but the same thing happened again! I recommend this place for the food, for sure! I've tried something different every time, and continue to love it."}
{"text":"This spot used to be a not-so-yummy, poorly-prepared sushi bar. I'm happy to see that someone recognized and tapped the potential of this location and its layout--so happy that i'm sad to be leavin Tempe. Anywho, the decor is rem. of The Vig, the food is good, and the vibe...well let's just say that it's a place you wanna be. Im thinking about during a dept HH here.  Also, this place made the best manhattan I've had in Tempe yet. Cudos to bartender who didnt introduce himself but made my 2manhattans drink-worthy each time :-)"}
{"text":"It breaks my heart that it took me so long to try this place, because I love it oh so much!   My friend and I were craving something new and exciting for girls night this weekend and stumbled upon Salut, and it was seriously the best!   The atmosphere is adorable, and the service was wicked friendly. The cucumber water we were served was delicious as was my red sangria and my friend's house wine. We split the hummus nachos to start, which were out of this world.... SO GOOD!   I had a bruschetta sampler for my meal which was awesome, and my friend had a burger and Greek fries (which were the bomb).   Our server was Haley and she was super sweet and totally on her game.   What an awesome experience and delicious food, we will totally be back!"}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict was half raw. Obviously the yolk should be runny, but the whites were almost completely transparent and very runny. The waitress apologized and asked if I wanted more potatoes. Eh, not really. They make a big deal about being dog friendly but the waitresses seemed a little afraid of my extremely friendly, mellow, well behaved pit bull. They were not afraid however, of the other dog on the patio, who got a lot of attention from the staff. Hmm. They did supply ice water and treats for the dogs which was thoughtful. After getting our check it took forever for the waitress to come get our credit cards, even though there was only one other table of customers on the patio. The place had promise, but our experience was pretty underwhelming."}
{"text":"Absolutely blown away by the wonderful service I received with my friends and I last Sunday! I'd never visited before, despite living at Gateway Apartments nearby in the past, so I found it somewhat funny and ironic that I visited only when I lived elsewhere. But I digress. I arrived with my friends and we were promptly seated. I was pleased to note that the patio was dog-friendly and noticed some furry little cuties sitting quietly under tables. Our server, Brian (or Bryan? I think it was Brian) was very attentive to us and really knew how to provide good service. He was patient with us and knew how to answer all our queries.  I ordered a Cowboy Omelette, I found the egg a little bit thick for my taste, but otherwise, the dish was wonderful. The Mexican chorizo omelette with mushrooms, tomatoes, cheese, bits of bacon was filling and full of flavor! And don't even get me started on the ranch-dusted potatoes--mmmm!!! My friends' dishes were also pleasing to them as well. We ordered a pitcher of PBR as their promotion, and one of my friends had a cocktail and it was delicious perfection! Their bottomless mimosas was quite a good deal as well. Brian was alert and kept our water glasses filled whenever they were empty, which I really appreciated as it was quite a hot day that day. I had a wonderful, memorable experience here and hope to visit here often with friends--perhaps next time for Happy Hour? My other friends who did not join me that day have always spoken highly of this place, and after my visit, I'm inclined to see why. Delicious food, yummy drinks and attentive service--what more can one ask for??"}
{"text":"Come here on a Groupon and had no issues. I was there late but called ahead and made reservations for a Wednesday night at 9pm. Normally they stop serving from the full menu but they told me they would honor it and they did!  I ordered the Peach Puzz Fizz, delicious! My date ordered Death in the Afternoon. Phew It was strong, but he really liked it.  For entrees we ordered the Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignon which was cooked to perfection and was melt in your mouth delicious. The Spicy Beer Braised Shrimp was unlike anything I have had before. Spicy but not overpowering, the sauce tasted amazing when the bread that accompanied the dish was dunked in it.  Just fantastic.  Then the best part came, the smores. Who doesn't love them?  It was the prefect ending to an almost perfect restaurant experience.   I say almost because the only minor incident I had was when the waitress saw my drink at half full, she asked if I wanted another one. I said no and she walked off with my class! Maybe she thought I was done? Anyways when she came back i explained to her I wasn't done and she quickly apologized and brought me another one on her.  She was very kind and gracious. This is my new favorite place! Can't wait to come back Groupon or not"}
{"text":"Would not recommend for breakfast, though some things done well: 1) great bacon 2) nice portion of fresh fruit instead of potatoes (if you ask - not printed on menu) 3) potatoes have a lot of surface area so pretty crispy 4) salmon/avocado breakfast is pretty good  Negatives: 1) very very dark inside - depressing and not conducive to waking up in the AM 2) patio has no sprayer system 3) orange juice is not juice -- it is an orange drink -- served with ice (what's up with that?) 4) mimosa made with orange drink rather than real orange juice (but not priced accordingly) 5) eggs are fried in bacon grease"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great happy hour(half off all wine bottles,) $2 off apps, and half off cocktails! Everything I've had I delicious- my favorite is the hummus nachos! This is a must-see location!"}
{"text":"Really good food but it was disgustingly hot out on the patio it was hard to enjoy any food."}
{"text":"Just had a super brunch with CCM. Our server, Chief kept our mimosas full - attentive and entertaining. The meals were delicious and the perfect atmosphere for Sunday with friends. Eager to come back again and try something new."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 4 or 5 stars but I cannot. The place has great atmosphere with attention to details including a nice, clean restroom. The staff was nice and attentive. The Moscow Mule was good.  My problem was that I am gluten free and specifically chose this place for their advertised gluten free options. I ordered the Bruschetta as did a few people with me (theirs was regular).  I should start by saying it tasted good. My problem was the size. Unless you saw the stark contrast between what they got and what I got, I guess you would not realize how much of a difference it was. My portions were less that an 8th of what they got ( my bread was cocktail size bread and since the space is less, the contents on top were an 8th less too) and yet I was charged $3 more for it being gluten free. I felt cheated and gouged. I did not complain while I was there because I was with a group and did not want to cause trouble, but in my humble  opinion, they should measure the toppings from the regular size plate and use extra pieces of the tiny bread if they want to make up for the value of charging $3 more for the gluten free. As it stands, I ended up getting a lot less food for $3 more.   If you go there for gluten free, either don't get that (stick with a salad) or know that you are going to feel a little cheated when it is all said and done."}
{"text":"This place has great food, we tried the hummus nachos which were awesome!! The bruschetta was good and the salut fries were super delicious and garlicky. Of course we tried the s'mores which they bring to you with a mini pit to toast your marshmallows! Soo cool! The place is very nicely decorated, but it was sure hot in there!!!!"}
{"text":"The pistachio salmon great. Service not so good. Never got my avocado hummus.  Asked another waiter for some ketchup etc waitress came back to bring the bill. So disappointed. First visit here was great second not so much and it's only a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Salut twice now with some of our friends and we have really enjoyed our experiences!   The staff is really friendly and knowledgeable, the selection of drinks and food is solid, and the overall feel of the place is really fun.   The bottomless mimosas are great - pre-mixed but served in a real wine glass so you don't have to worry about having an empty glass after 2 sips like most bottomless mimosas places.   I really like the Breakfast Pita - the bacon is awesome and the side of fruit is some of the best fruit I've had at a restaurant.   I've only sat inside, but I really want to try out the patio next time because it looks like a really fun place to be with music and lots of vegetation.   The location is great for us - a good in between place if you're meeting someone from Mesa and Tempe, so we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Salut Kitchen Bar is now on my list of favorite places to dine. The menu is unique and there is something for everyone from hummus to yummy salads.   I've been to Salute about 5 times in the last year including happy hour and a special occasion birthday dinner. Every time service has been impeccable. I joined the club and I get emails with special offers often. I like that!    The quinoa salad is awesome as is their chicken skewer. It was HUGE! The strawberry feta salad is equally as tasty. The toasted walnuts give is a delicious crunch. During a lunch visit, I had the caprese salad -- fresh tomatoes with mozzarella balsamic dressing on a beautiful afternoon on the patio was perfect. Once, I met friends for drinks there and we ended up having the s'mores fondue too. OMG. Chocolate heaven. Try it!   Last night I noticed the TVs on the patio. Totally missed those before. The World Series was on and the patio was lively with chatter and cheers for the Cubs. Really fun environment. The only tiny issue with the patio, which can't be helped is the vehicle noise from McClintock Drive. Loud cars driving too fast can be annoying. Good thing it ends quickly!  Noise doesn't deter me from patio seating though. It's a great place to relax. Bring your pup too! The patio is dog friendly which is special. Love that.   Salut, keep it up!  I'm bringing friends!"}
{"text":"I was really excited when I saw the menu for this place, but it was a total letdown!  I ordered from Postmates, and the food showed up cold. I ordered the salut sampler, which was $19 pre-tax, and it was a joke! It only had one mac and cheese bite, two small quinoa fritters, less than a handful of fries, and the half of a caprese salad. The fries were stale and cold.  The caprese salad was soggy and gross.  Not even worth $9, much less $19!  It is seriously outrageous that they charge that much for almost no food!  The salad barely had anything in it. Their menu definitely over sells their food. I was seriously disappointed and if I had ordered this at the restaurant myself, I would have demanded a refund!  Save your money and time and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place at the Mac-n-cheese festival, they had by far the best Mac-n-cheese there. When we went to the restaurant they didn't have that or any other Mac-n-cheese on the menu or the short ribs. Very disappointing since that's what we came for. The server was speed talking, there were too many specials she recited to us the we all tuned out. The drinks weren't good and the food boring. I won't go back. They could do so much better... add the Mac-n- cheese it was phenomenal."}
{"text":"I've been there twice in a month.  It's good to know that Tempe has a chic little spot for folks like me who like those kind of places.  The place is small on the inside with a large patio on the  outside, which will be perfect during the cooler months. Just don't let them sit you in the back corner because you will feel \"walled-in\"...I had to ask to be moved one time because I couldn't stand being back there.  I felt banished! So, upon walking in, if they don't make a left or right from the main entrance, you're going straight for the wall. If you are with a group you may not mind it, but a table for two just wont' cut it.  I do have to say although the food is good, I am not impressed by the menu.  It was just so limited for someone who has a colorful palette.  The waitstaff is efficient and friendly.  I'll go back but more for the drinks at happy hour!"}
{"text":"Food was great and decently priced. Sangria isn't bad but I imagine their other cocktails are better. They had a little patio area where their were people painting which I thought was really neat. Staff was really nice and their portions weren't crazy but but filling food with some healthy options.   The quinoa bowl was really good. The dried fruit was just right   Their signature burger with poblano pepper was delish."}
{"text":"Very nice spot. Nice patio and inside a very large inviting bar and a great happy hour. I think happy hour is 3:30 to 6:30 and bottles of wine are 50% off, and the list is pretty big. I had lunch, the quinoa and spinach salad with wild salmon. Very good, very filling with onions carrots feta avocado and a light balsamic dressing. Service was good, my next visit will be for some discounted wine and dinner."}
{"text":"Met some friends for happy hour and was really impressed with the service. They were super attentive and ensured we had everything we needed. They recommend the chicken kabobs and hands down the best kabobs I've ever had! Definitely will be going here again."}
{"text":"Halloumi bruschetta. Halloumi bruschetta. Oh my God, eat the halloumi bruschetta."}
{"text":"Atmosphere great!  Grilled cheese with bacon, ok.   And honestly, how does a grilled cheese with bacon not kick ass?"}
{"text":"Great food selection, and decent prices.  Has small portions, so make sure you order enough if super hungry.  Good atmosphere for date night!"}
{"text":"It would appear that this restaurant isn't a hidden gem, but Heather certainly is. If the wine and cocktail list isn't convincing enough, perhaps the menu will draw you in.   The 4 varieties of bruschetta I tried were quite good. The (reasonably priced) bottle of wine, wonderful. The service, exceptional!   If you're not sold on the food and booze, I insist you go just to meet Heather. She gets five stars and two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"When my waiter said \"I'm not much of a soda guy\" I knew this was gonna be special. Well, I am a soda guy so stop making me ask for refills!  The food was good and that's why I'm giving this 2 stars. Our server was MIA most the night, like I said, refills were slow and only upon request, they ran out of gluten free bread, my fries were cold and it took FOREVER to get our food. The last strike was that the suggested gratuity started at 18%!  I'm usually a good tipper (about 20%) but asking for it?!  A little presumptuous. I won't go back and wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Great customer service and had a quality conversation with the gm David and he took very good care of us. Food is amazing and great variety of drinks."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Salut Kitchen Bar in Tempe since it opened two and a half years ago. The restaurant has a great central location in the Valley, it serves up delicious food and cocktails, it has an expansive wine selection and great deals on bottles, it has a huge dog-friendly patio with sports televisions, the servers always seem like they actually care about you, and the bar and indoor service is friendly and relaxed. I headed there to check out some of their new fall menu items, and like always, I left with a fully, happy stomach.  My friend and I started with their Salut Sampler ($19), which gave us a taste of some of the restaurant's most popular appetizers - and they're all vegetarian! The hummus nachos were tasty, as always, with crispy pita chips topped with homemade hummus, red onion, feta, pomegranate seeds and a balsamic reduction. They're innovative bites that have remained a restaurant favorite.  The caprese salad in the sampler came with thick chunks of mozzarella and tomato slices, while the salut fries are coated with a seasoned herb blend and topped with a feta parmesan mix - an elevated fry option.  My favorite part of the sampler was a new menu item, the quinoa fritters. These balls of heaven are filled with quinoa, dill Havarti and red onion, fried to perfection and topped with crimini mushrooms. Our server told us he wasn't a fan of quinoa until he tried this dish, and I'm sure it could make anyone a quiona super-fan.  The sampler also comes with mac and cheese bites, another new menu item that I got for my meal as a full portion ($9). The cheddar mac and cheese is fried and served with chipotle aioli dipping sauce. After digging into the sampler, it was hard to finish the full appetizer as my meal, and every bit was delicious.  My pal got the Malbec burger ($13), made with melted provolone, carmelized onion, wild mushroom, malbec caramel sauce, lettuce and tomato on a brioche bun with red wine aioli. The burgers here are serious, and she said her meal was delicious.  Besides the tasty food, I loved that on the night we went, a paint-and-wine night was taking place, similar to ones I've participated in at studios and galleries. Salut's manager David said they'll be hosting more, and with all the top-notch menu items and vast array of wines and cocktails, I think hosting them at Salut is a stellar idea."}
{"text":"Salut is in an entirely unassuming part of Tempe, but it's a happy surprise! Once inside this little restaurant in a newer strip mall, it's a delightful eatery filled with character and personality. Once inside, you'd never know what was around you on the outside. The atmosphere is intimate and charming with dark wooden and metal features, dining table spread throughout the restaurant and a large bar taking up a lot of the space. They also have a small patio that is dog friendly!  First off, the happy hour here is amazing. They do $5 bottles of house wine and you don't even have to open it there. You could just simply take it home with you!   I recently dined here before seeing a show at ASU Gammage and found it to be a perfect restaurant before a show. It's just east of Rural on University but only about a 5-7 minute drive to the theater. My friend and I shared the bruschetta and the corn and goat cheese salad. You get to choose four bruschettas for $12 and each one is cut into two. The salad was on the smaller side. After eating the meal, I think we could have gotten one more item to share in order to leave completely full, but the food was excellent! I think I could have easily enjoyed the order of bruschetta to myself. We got four different kinds: Chicken & Hummus, Wild Mushroom, Fig, and Prosciutto with Apple. I really enjoyed all three but my two favorites were the Fig and Proscuitto. The bread was very soft and delicious.   The salad was flavorful complete with corn, goat cheese, chicken and avocado. It was a delicious salad but I wouldn't suggest splitting it if you're really hungry. Save it for yourself!   The food, environment and price was all very delightful and I will definitely return again for another visit!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, the food and staff are very polite and attentive. We had a birthday party of about 18 and Candice was great dealing with the big party. Everyone enjoyed their food and the service was great.   We also came back for brunch and football on Sunday. Gabby was great and the unlimited mimosas are amazing! I love the fact that they allow dogs on the patio! My dog had a great time. Strongly encourage you to try this place."}
{"text":"Did you know there is a such thing as happy hour on a Saturday? I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I had good things from friends but driving past I wasn't quite sure what to expect. The server (Amanda) was great, food was excellent, and the drinks were delicious. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting the Tempe area, and I came to see a friend. Conviently, my friend's cousin is the owner of Salut. As we talked and chatted throughout the night, I could smell all of the different dishes coming out from the kitchen. Everything was absolutely amazing!  I drank the Old Fashioned and a Arizona Sour, and ate spicy seasoned fries with the Sun Devil Burger.  Everything was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh so yummy.   My boyfriend and I came in with our two dogs after hiking around Papago Park. We had the patio to ourselves when we first arrived, and this gave my dogs time to get used to the atmosphere. We happened to get there during happy hour and got caprese salad and humus nachos off of the happy hour menu. The humus was really flavorful but I expected something different with the name \"nachos.\" It was essentially humus scoops on pita wedges drizzled with balsamic vinegar with a few pomegranate seeds and diced red onion for decoration. It was delicious, but not so much \"nachos.\" I expected more toppings. The mozzarella in the caprese salad was also tasty, it seemed very fresh possibly even locally made. For the main event I ordered the brie hive and my boo got the sriracha burger. My Brie hive was exactly what I was looking for. The combination of toasted sourdough bread, warm brie, crisp apples, prosciutto, and arugula(?) was spectacular. I would definitely come back for that sandwich. My love really enjoyed his burger and it smelled great and looked so very juicy from where I sat. For our sides I got the regular fries and he got the greek salad. Both sides were good enough but the sandwiches were really the stars of the show.  I also want to say that they were very welcoming to our two dogs. The chef brought them pepperoni dog treats to munch on and our waiter brought them a bowl of water. I thought that was very thoughtful of them and showed that they truly love animals. I really appreciated that added kindness.  When the restaurant started to get busy around 6pm we decided to leave. Our dogs were getting skittish with all of the people. I would definitely come back and next time try out some of their craft cocktails and their smores.  Just one small negative, they are right on University and that can give off some traffic sounds. There is also a low hum coming from the big power grid across the street, but you can only hear these clearly if no music is playing and you are sitting outside on the patio."}
{"text":"Nice patio it's cool that they offer roadrunners running event to come in. They offer great coupon deals occasionally. Bruschetta is pretty good beer selection is also nice."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner. I was there with my wife to celebrate our 12 year wedding anniversary. David the GM, Chris our server, the chef and the rest of the crew, all made this night memorable. I will be back for sure, and next time I'm bringing more people. Again, thank you. My 12 year anniversary was amazing and it was possible because the best service, amazing food and above all, genuine care from ALL who work there."}
{"text":"Just found myself a new wine bar in Tempe!  Love this place - good wine, looks awesome inside, and the hummus nachos rock.  Staff is really friendly too, so I'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Ok look I know I might sound a little pretentious here but this place .... Look I love what they are trying to do but the whole thing felt forced.  The wait staff while friendly could not take a hint and just let us eat, but more about that later.  The food, we ordered the sriracha blt bruschetta and it was 2 pieces of un-toasted bland french loaf with some lettuce and BACON BITS!!! It is listed as bacon but trust me it's bac'os, additionally not spicy at all and you could not taste sriracha.  Drinks were expensive which i am ok with IF they are good, moscow mule they served, meh. Sandwiches for main course again nothing to write home about and the \"famous\" salut fries were just too much.  Back to the wait staff, initially the girl who was serving us was friendly but then took forever to come back. Then towards the end there was another guy that just would not shut up and kept going on and on about the smores.  I was there with my coworker ... we don't want smores, as we went to prom about 20 years ago.The wait staff was either really overly nice or non attentive, we had 2 or 3 servers that evening and no explanation as to why this was happening.  We were seated near the back area by the bar and entrance to the kitchen, we saw some fries drop on the ground. One of the employees said something about it then proceed to pick them up off the ground with his hands.  Now highly unlikely that he was preparing or even touching my food but, get a broom.  It was just one thing after another.  Not a bad place just off the mark.  Please get rid of the bacon bits and please don't try and reply to say that was real bacon.  I would not come back here."}
{"text":"Can't say I'd come back other than for maybe a happy hour.  First I ordered a cheese board for the table. At $13 I expected a better selection of cheeses but we got a few chunks of 3 different cheeses, a handful of grapes, 3 big scoops of hummus and a few slices of green apple. *shrug* like that was it.  The waiter just dropped it off and bailed. I'm used to being asked if I'd like an explanation of the cheeses on the board or told w/o asking... nope. just dropped on the table. Later I asked him what type of cheese the marbled purplish one was... I got a confused look and a mumbled answer; to which he then disappeared again. My history with cheeses says it's a wine-soaked cheese of some sort but I guess I wasn't finding out.   Entre... I had the Chicken Chasseur. Presentation was grand. Taste left a lot to be desired. It seems the chicken had some seasoning on it... pepper it seemed but I couldn't taste it and it was boring and bland. I had two others try it to confirm my opinion and they agreed. There was just no life to the dish. Looked good at first but it's just a plain frozen chicken breast on a plate with warm mushroom sauce and a slight smattering of mushrooms around the plate laid on top of farro.   Stella pitcher was $20. That's fine but reminds me it's more of an ASU budlight kind of bar.   The girl said her burger was good. and I did very much enjoy her fries. The girls said their drinks were good but I wasn't in the mood to try mixed drinks. They had a groupon and there seemed to be an over-abundance of limitations on said groupons but the girls got out fine, were happy with their meals and even got a couple desserts thrown in too.  I'm not hating on the place but I don't find anything unique about it food-wise. I'd have givin it only 2 stars if the girls didn't enjoy their food like they did."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and drinks here. I made reservations 30 minutes prior to going and they were able to accommodate our group of 10. The interior was nice and clean and they let you bring your pets if you eat out in the patio area! Happy hour lasts till 7 and it's $2 off their appetizers. I ordered the Brie Hive which has shaved prosciutto, Granny Smith apples, arugula, melted Brie on honey butter sourdough with garlic aoli . The bread was a bit hard but I still enjoyed the sandwich. It tasted like a Bruchetta but sandwich style. I also got the Oh Honey Moscow mule. Although it wasn't served in a copper mug, the drink tasted good. Light and refreshing ;) Overall the servers were awesome , the service was great, food was good and the bartender made me some delicious birthday shots! Ill definitely be back to try brunch"}
{"text":"Cafe Boa finally has a competitor in Tempe!  For date night I know that some college folks will never abandon House of Tricks, but for a new urban wine bar you have to check out Salut.  Went on their opening night and it was packed with families and pretty people.  The price points are very reasonable and they have both beers on draft and wine on draft.  (Perfect for when you might need to down a few...err one quickly)  Ambiance:  Similar to the Garage in Phoenix mixed in with the original Postinos.  Big patio area which is nice.  Try to sit on that side, admittedly there is one side that faces right into a parking lot, (but in Az, what restaurant doesn't) They have great music without becoming too loud.  Food is mediterranean inspired.  Think olives, pomegranate, feta etc.  The salads are delicious and do not miss the mushroom ravioli which I could have devoured all by myself but was forced the share.  I was full from two appetizers and a salad and the aforementioned wine so I didn't get to the main entrees which looked tasty.  Clearly I will have to come back.  The staff is pretty, but more importantly, very nice and considering how new the restaurant is, they ran a very smooth ship.  I am really hoping that this restaurant inspires more eateries to open up in Tempe.  (I might have a reason to leave my 10 mile Phoenix bubble more often)"}
{"text":"They have happy hour on Sunday's from 3-6pm. We came here for brunch first the first time. The place is very chill and good drinks. We ordered their salmon advocate for $13 amazing! Also had two bottles of wine because they had a half off sale going on so we took advantage of it. Their service is on point, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is a jewel in the middle of the desert.   Best salmon I've ever had!  Great cocktails, and delicious desserts.   We found then thru the Tempe Chamber but we will be back with our friends!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. I first saw on groupon. I purchased it and but then ended up going earlier instead for my birthday happy hour. Food is a good and Happy hour pricing on wine is great. I ordered brushetta for HH and salut fries.  So yum. Went back a few weeks later to use my groupon for brunch. So excited we did. We got chicken/waffles and qinoa pancakes. By the way they have bottomless mimosas. Wow. I think they use Wycliff champagne which I like. Anyway our server was great. KYLE. He was very attentive and never let our cups get empty. This was important more so for the water because we had just come in from a 2 hour photo shoot in the AZ sun. Thanks again Kyle. Also he was new and we didnt even know until his trainer asked how he was doing at the end. I think he will do well here because he knew the menu and was quick to serve.   Try this place. Wont be disappointed. Did I mention I got tableside S'mores for my birthday. Thats why I choose the place and so happy. Will be back once a month for sure."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and Salut was absolutely phenomenal.  You gotta save room for the s'mores... if you can."}
{"text":"My wife, father, daughter and I came here for the first time today. I am a meat and potatoes kinda guy but was willing to try something different. This food is amazing. We tried a few things; hummus, bacon wrapped chestnuts (awesome), bruschetta, and oh my, the pesto is beyond amazing. Asked for a side of pesto with pita chips and that was the bomb. Chief was our server and he took fantastic care of us and the manager, Dave, is a breath of fresh air. This will definitely be a place we try again."}
{"text":"Keeping my 4 stars here.  Just wanted to add that I have had a couple of Sunday brunches here.  You can do bottomless mimosas for $18 and they open at 9:30am!  Everything I've had is tasty and the staff is always very nice.  I'll keep heading back here."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Train - Hey, Soul Sister)  Heeeyy, Heeeyy, Heeeyy!  Your wine bar sings on the patio of my Sunday brunch I knew I wouldn't forget you And so I went and let you blow my mind  Your sweet pancakes The smell of your food in every single bite I bite I knew when we tried it you're the one I have decided Who's one of the kind  Hey Salut Kitchen, ain't that Bo Bites Bo Bites on the patio, reviewing The way you cook ain't fair you know Hey Salut Kitchen, I don't wanna miss a single thing you serve.....tonight!  Heeeyy, Heeeyy, Heeeyy!   We came to Salut for brunch after a long run.  Needless to say, we needed some food bad!  The place itself was quite spacious and open with a large patio for outdoor seating and a full bar.  There was a one man band this lovely Sunday we attended.  Couple of us ordered the Bacon Bloody Mary while I stuck with the basic beer.  For food we went for the Chicken and Waffles, Quinoa Pancakes, and the Benedict Florentine.  I didn't have the chance to try the Florentine, but the Chicken and Waffles were delicious.  Extra crispy chicken breast atop a hearty belgium waffle with a side of cinnamon butter and honey maple syrup; so wrong, but so right at the time!  The Quinoa pancakes was made with cinnamon and honey giving it a spicy and sweet bite and topped with thick whip cream and strawberries.  Perfect start to my Sunday eating experience.  Foodies and runners alike should enjoy this spot as a must go!  Service was on top of things and the ambiance was semi-wine and semi-sports bar in my opinion.  They had a large screen projector showing the playoff game so that was nice. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was another place that my friends have brought me! It's always good to have friends who know the area, have tried it already, and want to share good places with you!   To be honest, we came here for the drinks but they have some awesome food too!   We'll start with the food....  There were three of us and we got different things and shared it all. So we ended up getting the hummus nachos (I'm told it was something thy're known for?), it came out in pita triangles, with a mix of hummus, red onions, pomegranate seeds, balsamic reduction, and feta cheese. I gotta say though between the pomegranate and balsamic reduction it was sweet, which I wasn't expecting at all but I should have after reading those two items on it. It was delicious!! I'm not a fan of crispy pita but it all worked out very well and complimented the whole dish. And you could always substitute the pita for cucumbers for an additional charge, but if you do do that, make sure you have already tried it with the pita first!!   Chicken panini with salut fries. I had a bite of the chicken panini and completely stole the fries (I love good fries!). The chicken panini wasn't too special to me, I mean it's pretty good but I'd rather have the fries honestly! Between the vinaigrette they use and the feta cheese it was good!  And the bruschetta was a choose 3 for $13, so I ended up with the garlic, caprese, and pesto. Out of the three I think my favorite was the caprese mostly because of the mozzerella and balsamic reduction made it the best of the three, but they were all good.   Next time though I think we'll just stick with the hummus nachos because that was the most delicious out of all of them!   Now, onto the drinks!   I first got the mi amor, which was stronger then I expected, always a good thing! It was actually pretty good, between all the craft cocktails this one sounded like it was the most delicious only because of the chambord and pineapple juice really, but the belvedere and champagne helped.   Got a oh honey mule which had honey vodka, cucumbers, strawberries, ginger beer, and lime juice. I'm not sure between the mi amor or the honey mule which was better. Maybe the mule? It was definitely stronger but it was delicious, I could down the whole cup without thinking anything of it but don't be fooled if you did do that, you'd definitely be feeling it pretty quickly!!   I can't wait for the next time I'm in the area, friends, good food, and good drinks are always what someone needs after any day!   Also they're pet friendly!! You can bring your pups out to their outdoor patio which is always great! Why leave them at home when you can bring them to hang out?"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem. Happy hour here is easily the best in the valley. We got the humus nachos, bruschetta, salmon & an added fillet mignon, 2 bottles of wine and smores. Really really excellent all around. Our server Jessica was outstanding as well. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Salut Kitchen Bar is around the corner from my work, so I come here occasionally for lunch. Great little restaurant with some unique dishes like hummus nachos (delicious) and fried quinoa fritters (also nomz). My favorite dish so far is the mushroom ravioli on the appetizer menu. It's big enough to count as lunch, very creamy and flavorful. (I am always full after eating it, but a big man might not consider it enough food.) The bruchettas are amazing - best one is the mushroom bruchetta. I've also tried their chicken sandwich, grilled cheese, chopped salad, and pesto pasta. Everything is high-quality and tasty.      Given that I'm usually here at 11am during the week, it's pretty quiet inside. The music selection is always great - a mix of house music and electronic music! Nice Spotify playlist! I imagine that things can get loud on the weekends when you've got drunk ASU students on the patio. I like that the patio is dog-friendly and I may bring my dogs here one day.  Salut has a mailing list you can get on, where they send you text messages with coupons for free appetizers and discounts on meals.  5 stars for food and staff, 4 stars for ambiance, 4 stars for prices (can be a little expensive for lunch). They have good happy hour deals. Nice spot to take your significant other on a classy, affordable date!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place just like this. I like the ambiance here. The service was top notch & they have a solid drink menu. Great happy hour specials! I had the Oh Honey! Mule & the Salut Sampler.. both fantastic! I will definitely be coming back for brunch."}
{"text":"I was in here a couple weeks ago for happy hour.  Sitting at the bar the service was fast and friendly.  The bartender was very informative about the drink and food menu.  Prices on wine and beer are quite good for happy hour.  The hummus nachos were also very tasty and $2 off during happy hour."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing!!!  The salmon plate with lemon risotto is anything anyone could ever want, and the surprise me cocktail was a delightful surprise indeed!  Hannah was fantastic!  Even though we got there pretty close to closing time, she was hospitable, and never made us feel rushed!!  The aesthetic of industrial chic was also quite a nice touch!!  Kudos to you all!!!"}
{"text":"Sat down at noon. Ordered shortly after. Over 65min and still no food... food comes out and it's horrible. Will never come back"}
{"text":"I am a food enthusiast, so when I read its reviews on good ol' yelp I thought it would be a great idea to by a groupon and check it out. The decour of the place is beautiful and very well maintained, but as I walked in my boyfriend and I kinda didn't know what to do so we stood around waited to be greeted. We were sat by a super polite host who told us our server would be with us shortly. The place was not busy at all, we were 1 of 3 couples in the whole area, and you can bet it took the server SEVENTEEN (17) minutes to come greet us and offer us water and suggestions. I did time it because my boyfriend and I were about to walk out of the locale.   I ordered the specialty salmon and my boyfriend a burger. The salmon was lacking flavor and the side rice was nothing out of the ordinary. My boyfriend enjoyed the burger but he said it was nothing special.   I have to give it to them on the drinks. We had the specialty drink with absinthe in it and it was quite tasty! I would still recommend this place because the atmosphere is quite nice and their specialty drinks are delicious.   If they stepped up their customer service they would be amazing. Maybe it was because I was using a groupon? Regardless you should never treat potential guests poorly, it drives service away. I tipped 100% ($20) and even with the groupon my tab was $40. I promise you if the customer service was better and prompt I would a regular there. The place is nice!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place! I came in for happy hour this past week with a few girlfriends and we had an awesome time. Our server was so sweet and charismatic. She let us know that she was still new and went above and beyond to make sure we had a great time. She went into great detail on their menu items and was supper helpful. The manager that evening even came by to check on us and brought us complimentary sangria. The food is delicious and a pretty good deal during happy hour ($2 off all appetizers). I want to come back for brunch and try their bottomless mimosas!"}
{"text":"Came back to use my groupon; the service was friendly but I wouldn't say it was speedy by any means.  The cocktail I ordered was sickening sweet and I ended up trading with my fiance for his moscow mule.  The mule wasn't overly sweet but there were muddled cucumbers that got stuck in your teeth every time you took a sip.  I had the brie sandwich that seemed pretty small and uninteresing.  My fiance had a burger and that was really tasty.  The reason I took this place down a star is because we both ended up feeling sick the next day from the food.  Bottom line, after trying this place out twice, is that I will only be back for the hh wine special.  This place has just missed the mark on the food."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. Awesome staff. Unique food. Ok taste."}
{"text":"We were looking for a Gluten free restaurants. I found Salut on Yelp. My wife had Roasted Corn Salad, my mother in-law and I had the Salmon... All were delicious. Service was great!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Brought my whole family here for a celebratory meal. It wasn't that busy, but we waited what seemed like forever for our food. Because of the wait, they brought our table free celebratory shots- pretty awesome! This alone redeemed them in my book, and when the food did arrive it was great. A few people at my table got the Brie Hive sandwich and it seemed to be a hit. Salut fries are also a must. I loved the decor, too. Look all around and you'll see so many unique re-purposed pieces!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Great date night restaurant. Service is always awesome and they have a fantastic menu."}
{"text":"Maybe you'll have better luck. I used ubereats to get their chicken kabobs. The delivery was fast and perfectly on time. The kabobs, however, were not that good. The chicken was rubbery and chewy. You know that type of chicken we all had before - where your jaw gets tired from excessive chewing. Maybe they just had a rough night, but there are way too many restaurants to have to give salut a second chance.  You can try your luck. The meals are large and very affordable. Plus, using my code you can get $10 off your next ubereats delivery: eats-mbdvx"}
{"text":"My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed the food, the decor, the wait staff of this small restaurant.  I would recommend Salute Kitchen Bar if you are in the Tempe area.  My friends all had different burgers and everyone really enjoyed their selection."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. A group went out after an evening meeting and it was great for the group (wasn't particularly crowded that night). They had live music that did pretty good covers of some great songs, but it was loud and made talking a little difficult.  Food was very good and they had a big selection of brews. I would recommend checking it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"First time here, awesome time!  Coming back soon!  Hannah provided us with great service."}
{"text":"Happy hour are awesome with great prices. I do recommend the hummus and the quinoa balls. The environment is very cosy and the staff is very friendly and polite. We love Haley because she is beautiful polite and always remember our drink."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken and waffles!!! Service was a bit slow but food was well worth the wait. Drinks were strong and tasty. Overall a great brunch spot"}
{"text":"The food was really good, nice ambiance, great customer service.  I liked all of the decor as well, I never considered making a lamp out of a wine bottle ;) my only recommendation, if you go for the mimosas, request to have your orange juice apostate from your champaign, the orange juice is pretty sweet."}
{"text":"I ordered several tapas and they were all great. The hummus nachos were the best. For drinks I had a Cucumber Mule and the Lavender. Both were fresh and well balanced. This is a great restaurant overall although the price remains a little high for the location. Almost a 5 star."}
{"text":"Went back with a friend and had Hummus Nachos, Salut's Fries and we ordered the smores for dessert! I wish the fries came with some sort of dipping sauce, but it was still delicious. The smores were so much fun to make. I would definitely recommend it for a date night."}
{"text":"I bought an Amazon local deal a while back, which expired...but I had the paid value to use, so the BF and I stopped in for lunch on our way back from the Botanical Gardens.  The decor was great!  Really loved the patio.  Lots of shade.  A+ service.  Granted, there weren't many customers since we got there right at 11am.  Still the guy that waited on us was very friendly and knowledgeable.  I had a glass of their house Cabernet which was $5.  Tasted great, but I had the worst....I mean, the WORST wine headache I've ever had in my entire life a couple hours later.  It lingered until after I woke the next morning.  Ugh.  I told our server I wanted the Hummus Nachos for my entree.  The server said \"They're actually pretty filling!\"  Hmmm.  That should have been a red flag.  I'll eat an appetizer for my meal quite often.  Anyway, I had also seen on the menu that you could get cucumber instead of Pita for a GF option.  Although I'm not GF, I do love cucumber with my hummus so I asked if I could have half cucumber, half pita.  \"No problem\" he said.  The BF ordered some burger with their Salut Fries.  So, 10 minutes later, out comes our food.  The BF's burger and fries looked great!  Best burger he's had in a really long time, he tells me later.  As for my hummus nachos.  3 pita triangles, 3 small, thin slices of cucumber, each with a scoop of hummus, some diced red onion, and crumbled feta, and pomegranate seeds sprinkled on top, with a balsamic drizzle.  Now his \"They're actually quite filling\" comment made a lot more sense.  So, they tasted great, don't get me wrong.  The ones made with pita were great.  I could smash the hummus down to cover the pita, and dip it into the additional balsamic drizzle on my plate.  Delish.  The ones made with cucumber, well, the cucumber was sliced so thin, I could hardly pick them up, as they could not support the weight of the the hummus.  It really just tasted like I was eating a big spoonful of hummus.  This was $9?  Well, now I know for next time.  What really surprised me was when I got the bill, I was charged and extra $1 for those 3 ridiculously small slices of cucumber.  Whaaat?  At Pita Jungle you get almost an entire sliced up cucumber for a dollar, and you still get your pita too!  I ended up eating half of the BF's fries, which were good, but soaked in oil and garlic.  As if fries aren't greasy enough to start.  I'll go again, since my BF loved his burger so much, but I won't get the house cab, and I won't was my money on those nachos."}
{"text":"Wow. Dissapponted. I walked in and ordered an armold palmer, they came back with an ice tea.   I ordered the chicken kale salad and got a bone in my boneless chicken. Not happy. How unattractive.  Wont be back. Super sad one of my friends owns this.  Also they need more than two mexican beers! Dos XX and Cornona dont count!!"}
{"text":"Salut has many options for those who enjoy a plant-based diet, which is a high compliment in my book.   Add to that their happy hour and creative pricing, their welcoming of dogs, and the ease of parking, and i am one happy customer."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great food. small portions and extremely expensive. Awesome patio, dog friendly.. Would recommend it for a night out but expect $55-65 dollar tab for two people to eat out.."}
{"text":"Great casual atmosphere. We ordered two appetizers. The hummus nachos and the quinoa fritters. I loved the hummus nachos but the fritters where not to my liking.I had the strawberry salad with goat cheese it was amazing. The bacon and cheese sandwich was good the french fries were just okay. My husband's hamburger was great. One of the best things on the menu is that banana waffle dessert it is small so I don't think you're going to share it. Great service too ."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and was looking for something reflective of local food and ambience. Great service. Gorgeous outdoor area with dog seating. Food was fantastic and the staff was very knowledgable. Made great suggestions for us. Definitely coming back on my next visit to AZ."}
{"text":"We had brunch there (chicken and waffles and eggs benedict), and it was excellent.  Good food and good service.  We didn't have cocktails because we were getting ready for a road trip, but it looked like they had a good menu."}
{"text":"Great experience! Delicious food! Fantastic live music!  The host Sarah worked well when our party of 3-5 turned into a party of 8. Thanks girl! We even switched tables (which can be annoying) and the staff didn't express any irritation. We decided on Salut because of their $5 Martinis (on Wednesdays) which were pineapple tonight! mmm tasty and not overly sweet.  Our server Adele took great care of us! I switched  to the house pino noir which was perfect with the hummus nachos! My friends got a couple of reasonably priced pitchers of Rolling Rock and the Salut fries. We shared a bruchetta board which was a hit! You get a choice of 4 different bruchettas for $12. We got the garlic & roasted red pepper, fig & goat cheese (FAV!), mushroom & sundried tomatoes (OH YUMM), and pesto & tomato.   It was free s'more night also. We got two platters of graham crackers w chocolate pieces, marshmallows, metal skewers,and a hot coal pot to roast the marshmallows! Super tasty!   We had the delight of meeting the manager and even got to meet the owner. They were fun and made our night amazing. Lots of laughs and great food & drinks! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Started off the evening with a refreshing Cucumber Mule over ice in a copper cup. Next were the Cucumber Hummus Nachos, from which their menu description does no justice. Creativity with this dish earns them much respect in my book. The hummus had, I believe, caramelized onion, balsamic, and chunks of nuts. What an original idea.  Then came the  Apple Brochette on sliced french bread along with feta.  This dish was made to be enjoyed while sipping a glass of wine.  Two more appetizers were quickly consumed including Mediterranean tacos, and feta french fries.    Desert was the \"piece de resistance.\"  S'mores!  Yep, s'mores.  They bring out this mini s'more roaster which I assumed contained Sterno, and graham crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows along with a fondue stick.  You then proceed to make s'mores on your table. How fun is that!  Service was fun, efficient, and non intrusive."}
{"text":"Very cute place! Patio is awesome. Hummus nachos were delicious! Balsamic glaze and feta were delicious with the hummus and pita chip nachos.  You can sign up for their eClub and they'll send you a coupon for a free order. Our table had the chicken pita, the bacon grilled cheese, and the habenero vodka bolognese. Everything was delicious, but the goat cheese blend on the pasta was my favorite."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Always have great coctails, and the service is great. Must try the hummus nachos, you wont find nachos like this anywhere else. If your not into the Nachos thing try the malbec burger.. SOOOO good!!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and it was AMAZING!!! I sat in the patio and brought my dogs. The food was amazing. I really want to come for brunch because ummm hello 1¢ mimosas!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've waited so long to try Salut. The food is incredible. My mom and I ordered the pistachio crusted salmon and the strawberry fields salad. The salmon was perfectly cooked, and the salad perfectly dressed. Both dishes executed very well. I came to try the chicken and waffles, but it's only served on the weekends. Go ahead and twist my arm...I guess I'll have to go back! Tyler was our waiter and he was hilarious. I hope we get seated in his section next time we visit. Overall, my first dining experience at Salut was very positive."}
{"text":"In searching for an ideal venue for a group celebration, I discovered many restaurants that were not eager for us to gather there. Not Salut! From my first call, the team was excited to assist with the special event, set aside a large area of the patio, and even called to confirm before the day.   Once we arrived, we enjoyed amazing food, attentive service and wonderful ambiance. The drink menu is creative and the bottomless mimosas are a must. I had an omelet with fresh veggies and breakfast potatoes that rocked.   The servers were on point- never missing an empty glass, offering to do split checks and comfy with fun banter.  I HIGHLY recommend this special place."}
{"text":"We used to love going here. The service has really taken an unexpected turn for the worse. You guys can't sit people without menus for 10 minutes in today's world. In addition as soon as we walked in the door we were ignored by two employees talking. It's used to be much better. We didn't stick around to order food. We didn't want to chance the food quality going downhill too.  Update - Manager reached out to me and tried to remedy the situation. I greatly appreciate the effort and perhaps we'll give it another shot soon."}
{"text":"On a beautiful Saturday afternoon, I decided to head to Salut after participating on the MS walk since it was close by.  We decided to seat outside on the patio and it was nice.  Being so close to the University, I expected the place to be a little more busy and more livelier, but it was slow, calm, and relaxing.  I ordered the Breakfast Nachos - pita chips with hummus, bacon, and egg whites.  My bf ordered the bacon beer & chorizo. We were pretty hungry so I expected a good portion of food.  It's practically commonplace to be served breakfast food in generous portions - enough for two people per entrée (or so I thought).    Our server starts heading over with two plates in her hand and they looked like appetizers for a table - Didn't expect that the plates were for us, she delivers the food at our table.  I look at my plate and there are FIVE (5) triangle shaped pita chips with a tablespoon of hummus, 2 bacon bits, and 3 scraps of egg whites per chip.  Is this for real?  I normally need a doggy bag and I normally share with my bf too.  To my bf, I pretty much said \"Sorry, I can't share with you this time.\"   His entrée was pretty sad looking too.  Two poached eggs, a small size of breakfast potatoes and where's the bacon?!  We had a water boy who was really prompt at making sure our cups were always refilled and plates were picked up.  He is so good that when I ate the last pita chip, I noticed there was small bacon bits that I wanted to pick up with my finger and eat from my plate, but he was in my face in 2 seconds picking it up.  He picked up my plate before I can get to it.    Right when he picked it up, he saw my one finger motioning to the plate, but it was too late.  Then he asked, \"Are you done with that plate?\"  By that time, I'm thinking, \"Well, obviously not because you saw my one finger move toward my plate - but it would be so embarrassing to tell him no for just two bacon bits!\" So I proceeded to say, \"Yes, I am done.\"    When we got our check, we spent more than I expected = $25.  Don't you hate it when you feel the last thing that will make you feel like you are done eating is eating that last piece of rice, piece of bread, piece of bacon bit was taken away from you??! I hate it.   Salut, you owe me 2 bacon bits!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience all around!  Our party of three visited for the first time for Mother's Day lunch, and can't wait to return. It was a perfect day to sit outside, and Salut has created a very cozy, comfortable, and inviting space on their patio.  Our service exceeded all expectations. Our server Keary was happy to help our indecisive group navigate both the food and cocktail menu, and her recommendations did not disappoint. We started with the wonderfully refreshing Skinny  Mojitos, and the Hummus Nachos, which were truly out of this world - a must try for anyone visiting this restaurant. We decided to share several of the appetizers and a salad vs. ordering entrees.  The menu is refreshing, offering a welcome break from the typical standard fare.  The Quinoa Fritters were phenomenal, and the Mediterranean Shrimp Tacos, Salut Fries, an Strawberry Salad were all delicious. We had to end with the S'mores, presented with a tiny tabletop grill- such a fun way to end our visit!! The owners and staff clearly have a passion for what they do and have created a happy, friendly environment. Pair that with the unique menu and flair for cool decor inside and out,  this spot will definitely keep us coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I was in town and went to brunch with friends. The food was wasn't very satisfying, and the service was very slow. The potatoes were crunchy like potato chips. When I asked the waiter if I may have some jelly for my toast, he replied, \"No...because we don't have any.\"  One friend arrived a little later and had to wait to order because they were \"transitioning from brunch to lunch\". I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you have to come here, get the Salut fries.   Came here with friends for happy hour on a weekday. They were not busy at all with only 4-5 other tables occupied. We sat outside and the atmosphere was nice-- felt like a legit happy hour kind of place if you know what I mean. Despite being mostly empty the service was surprisingly slow. The service was friendly and they offered me a couple of samples of beer since I was unsure about their offerings. I ordered the Applewood grilled chicken sandwich with the Salut fries (like Greek fries - feta cheese and oil). That took 20-30 minutes to come out. I asked for a place setting (I arrived after my friends) and that took another 5 minutes. Everything we asked for including the checks and take out boxes took much longer than it should have since there really wasn't much going on here. The chicken sandwich was overcooked, dry, and pretty much tasteless, but the fries were seriously awesome. I mean, I might even put up with the bad service again just for the fries. Nah, I'll probably order take out and order an hour ahead..."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, and the food was even better. Probably my new favorite place to get fehttuchini. A++."}
{"text":"Love this place! The Hummas Nachos are amazing and the bottomless Mimosa's cant be beat! The staff is a ton of fun and it's a great place to take guests."}
{"text":"I was happily surprised by Salut. Last week my friend won their instagram prize and asked me to come hang out for bottomless mimosas and NFL game-watching. Because I am me, I immediately peeked at the menu and was very excited by the variety of good they had to offer. In my head, I was already deciding on what to eat. However, once I got to Salut, my mind changed and I decided on the Chicken Pita. This was delicious. The pita was soft, and the fillings were super good. Extra garlic aioli was definitely a good decision. The fries on the side were seasoned well with rosemary and sea salt. We of course took advantage of bottomless mimosas. We told our server we liked the balance of champagne to orange juice, and she was happy we told her because other guests I guess had complained about the ratio. Whatever - they were just the right mix to be a little dangerous. When we were done with our meal I was craving some desert, and lo-and-behold THEY HAVE SMORES. Seriously the BEST idea ever and I was so so so happy with them. They totally hit the spot. All the people who served us through the day, including the manager (David) were great, helpful, and very fun. I will DEFINITELY be coming back to Salut for Sunday football and mimosas and I am looking forward to testing out other yummy dishes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend I came here with a Groupon one day after work. The place is very dimly lit and I wouldn't recommend sitting by the door which is where we were seated even though we had a reservation and the restaurant was not at all busy when I arrived there.   There is a dining room with more space but the bar area is a very tight space and our waiter was constantly having to step out of the way of people so that they could walk by our table.   So the food:  We both ordered the sriracha burger and that was probably a mistake on both our parts. I love spicy and my boyfriend can't handle as much spicy as I can but neither of us could really enjoy the burger because it was just way too spicy. When we took the sauce off though it was really good.   The fries were VERY good. We both preferred the regular fries to the Salut fries though. The Salut fries have an interesting sauce on them that I wasn't a fan of for two reasons: 1) They made the fries soggy and 2) They also had a real tangy greek flavor that I just couldn't enjoy with the fries.   We each ordered a drink because it came with our Groupon. My boyfriend got this delicious cocktail called the Lavender Lemon Fizz which was really good, the waiter said it was one of the more popular drinks and I can see why. I got the Peach Fuzz Fizz and it was pretty good but I definitely liked the Lavender drink better.   Overall I think I would got back but only with Groupon because their prices are a little steep for what they offer, I think you pay more for the Wine Bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Salut is one of my favorite restaurants! I love going there and bringing my friends visiting from out of town there. I highly recommend the hummus nachos, although everything is amazing! The staff is also always friendly and accommodating, and they allow dogs in the patio!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. They have gluten free options for sandwiches and burgers and good deals on drinks all the time. You can get a discount on wines through yelp. Service is regularly pretty good too. The gluten free bread they use for the burgers doesn't really stay together but the flavor of the burger makes up for it."}
{"text":"Having a great time at Whit's going away ; but it wouldn't be as successful without the help of Tyler !!!"}
{"text":"Great food and extremely allergen friendly. Have a great drink menu and will make you something if not on menu. Recommend the stuffed avocado and any of the burgers. Also have live music frequently."}
{"text":"Simply wonderful. The mushroom ravioli starter is by far the best ravioli I have ever eaten (this coming from a person who won't eat mushrooms!). There were three of us and the only mediocre meal was the quinoa salad, which was very blah. On to the next mouth blowing experience, the beer braised shrimp pasta. I can't even explain how fabulous this dish is; who would have thought beer makes a delicious pasta sauce?!? The decor is very interesting; we found ourselves searching for the next cool thing to look at. Staff was very accommodating and friendly. We will definitely return on our next visit to AZ, or maybe again before we leave tomorrow!"}
{"text":"First time here at Salut, granted I used a chicken deal: 2 wine flights and appetizer. This should feed 2?? We ordered the caprese kabobs, we received 3 kabobs, very small kabobs. When we received our wine flights we didn't get the name, place or any information mentioned about the wine. The atmosphere was very nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Salut a few years ago and didn't have a good experience, but recently returned to give it another try. So glad we did - we had a great experience! Food was delicious (new menu) and service was fantastic. My husband had the Merlot burger and loved it. Tyler took care of us that night and he did a great job."}
{"text":"This may be my 1st Yelp review, but it's warranted.  I checked this place out for lunch today & the food was great, atmosphere was trendy and staff was very friendly.  The GM even introduced himself and comped one of our dishes for mentioning Yelp!  Really fantastic experience.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I came in tonight with some girlfriends from work and I was honored to be served by the bartender named chief. He was such an illusion on the eyes it was so stunning the drinks he placed in front of us were  mesmerizing unbelievable. I never wanted to leave the place.. Chief is now my guilty pleasure and you have to pay me to stop coming to the place"}
{"text":"So, I've been here before and it was really good. But this time... Our waitress was so slow (Raven). It took forever for my friend to get her prosecco. How hard is it to pour a drink in a glass? I ordered the avocado salmon and the white part of the egg was stringy and looked like snot. I made them make it again. And the waitress argued with me saying that that's how it was supposed to look. The second time it looked significantly different! The avocado was sliced. And the egg was cooked normal. However! They forgot the hollandaise sauce :/ lame... Yeah 1 big fat star. Where's my check at? They charged me full price btw...and! It's hot as fuck in here. 110 degrees in Arizona heat baby!"}
{"text":"Got a pickup order for our team's Friday lunch from Salut. The bartender helped me with my order, but even the manager came out to shake my hand personally and thank us for our large order. We'll be coming back again, everyone loved the food!"}
{"text":"Great new neighborhood place. The staff aims to please.  Nice wine and food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place... Been drooling over their Instagram for some time now. Did not disappoint one bit.  Went for a Sunday brunch and put down a few items:  - Oreo Pancakes were amazing... Def recommend. Not too sweet either, great balance.   - Cinnamon Toast Crusted Chicken & Waffles were the star of the meal. Juicy chicken with crispy crunch in eat bite and the waffle was the perfect texture and sweetness.   - Bacon Beer Chorizo was our least favorite which was surprising. Sauce felt a little thick and wasn't very hot. Still a good dish, might have just been off that morning.   - French Press Coffee was pretty solid too.   Overall, great experience and will be back. Oh and that morning there was some live music which made the whole experience even better."}
{"text":"What a surprise - never realized this place was a few minutes down the way from ASU, and so good. The wait staff was awesome - friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. All the cocktails we ordered were good (and came to the table fast!). By far the best was the Spicy Berry Margarita with muddled strawberries and jalapeno. Divine.   This place is family owned and operated so you are actually eating Mom's homemade food when you dine here. The star of the show is the Hummus Nachos. I'm not a big hummus person, but this appetizer is yummy! Homemade hummus on a crispy pita chip, topped with red onion, feta, and pomegranate seeds... and then drizzled with a balsamic reduction. One of the tastiest appetizers I've had - it's melt-in-your-mouth good. Will be coming back again... a new favorite in Tempe."}
{"text":"Breakfast was amazing! They have a dog friendly patio which is a plus! Bottomless mimosas which are delicious and large. Had the Cowboy Omelet with Hangover Fries! It was so good, I ate every bite! The staff was very friendly and attentive. I would definitely visit there again. Next time I'm in Arizona. Could be soon, I'm craving Hangover Fries!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! I love the decor and the bar staff is really friendly. You need to come in and try the food. If I could I would eat their everyday. They have a great line up of different beers and wine. Its somewhere you want to go when you don't want to deal with the mill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner on the patio.  We were accommodated nicely and not super packed in.  Checked in to get the discount with yelp on the wine.  It was a fantastic red house that was semi sweet. Unfortunately I can't remember exactly what it was.    Anyways I ordered a chicken panini that was good,  but not spectacular.  I wish I had ordered plain fries though,  because I was not a fan of the toppings.  Definitely a selected taste. I loved the atmosphere so I'll definitely come back,  but will try something else.  Service was good as well,  always had full water and a happy server.  We even ran into corporate which gave us a discount on shots!  (We were here for a 21st bday)."}
{"text":"Ordered the biscuits and 'beer chorizo' gravy which tasted EXACTLY like the chili you would put on a hotdog. Not good.   Ordered a side of skillet potatoes... got about 3 tablespoons of the tiniest chopped potatoes ever that were SUPER overcooked. They were *literally* less than a cubic centimeter. For $3.   Friend ordered the sriracha panini and said it sucked too.   The kitschy handmade tables are interesting and the location next to the yarn store is ok, but man the food suuuuucks."}
{"text":"I stopped in yesterday for a drink and dinner and had a wonderful meal. The Malbec burger was to die for!!! I was a bit disappointed in the service as it was quite slow but maybe it was an off night for them. I'd go back for a second try and there's a groupon too, so why not!"}
{"text":"Very below average. Food took forever to come. Drinks average at best. Burger so so and lack of flavor. Salad average at best. Only thing that kept it from one start was pita hummus nacho appetizer. That was good. I would have to imagine postinos bus boy has absorbed enough knowledge to open up a \"wine bar\" equally as good."}
{"text":"-Price and Quantity: Overall, all menu are pretty pricer than what I expected. Salut Kitchen Bar provides right amount of portion size for customers. You have to plan least $13.00 with tax and tip, and average I would say $16.00.   -Dish 1 Review: BACON GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH -- $9.00 --   3.0/5 stars The sandwich and fries were delicious. However, nothing really special about the dish.  Re-order: NO  -Dish 2 Review: SALUT BURGER -- $11.00 --   3.0/5 stars The Burger was good but nothing special about it. For this price, I would expected special recipe but I could not taste it.  Re-order: NO  -Comparison with other restaurant: Salut Kitchen Bar Vs. Four Peaks Brewing Co  If you want to drink and have a good food, I would suggest Four Peaks Brewing Co. Salut Kitchen Bar has good view and food, too. However, I was not satisfy with that price for that food. Definitely, Salut Kitchen Bar is a good place to date and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and mimosas and loved the place! It's a super cute vibe, food was delicious, and server was great."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and had an awesome experience. Tyler was very friendly and took care of our needs! Will definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Salut with two girlfriends for happy hour. We were promptly greeted by Keary who made food and drink recommendations. We started with the hummus nachos, which we were told are the specialty, and we got them half on pita, half on cucumber. Yumz!! Next were the quinoa fritters. Oh em gee. Next time we might just get three orders of those!! We were still a little hungry, so we ordered four pieces of bruschetta which David, the fabulous manager, asked the chef to cut into thirds. The bruschetta was also very good but if we're being honest, I'm still dreaming about the quinoa fritters.  As it was happy hour, we could order one bottle of wine (at a very reasonable price) and get a bottle of one of their house wines for $5. Keary told us we could take the 2nd bottle home unopened, or she would cork it for us if we didn't finish it. Fabulous!   Keary was friendly and informative, and even stopped to chat a little with us about an upcoming weekend trip we were taking. We also had the pleasure of meeting the charming Chris, who made sure our glasses were never empty. Many thanks to Keary, Chris and David for the awesome service! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the service was great. Barbara is an attentive and caring server who works hard to please the customer. That being said...  My boyfriend and I came to Salut after recommendations from a mutual friend. In addition Yelp stated their happy hour was till 7pm. We arrived at 6:30 and ordered two glasses of Cab. It was good and looking over the menu I was excited. The food seemed promising and reasonably priced. When I asked if the bruschetta was on happy hour Barbara informed us that they changed their happy hour till 6:30. Everything was full price. We were fine with that.   I ordered the piquillo bruschetta. My boyfriend the Pepperonata sandwich. The bruschetta had a pepper spread, green bell peppers, onion, bacon and smoked Gouda. When it came out I was already disappointed. When I order bruschetta I expect the bread to be crunchy (I know what is bruschetta...I'm Italian). The bread wasn't even close to toasted. The \"pepper\" spread tasted like it was BBQ sauce out of a bottle mixed with ketchup and some pepper for a kick. The bell peppers, onion, and Gouda were diced. The bacon was diced as well and cold. It's as if the chef cut bread slapped BBQ sauce on it cut the veggies and let the bacon thaw out before placing it on the top. I'm not confident the bacon was anymore then thawed out. Cooked? Not sure. The piquillo bruschetta can beat described as a Red Baron frozen pizza, left outside of the freezer, thawed and served.   My boyfriends sandwich wasn't much better. He ate maybe a quarter of it and gave up. We both focused on the fries (the only saving grace to the meal).   While their wine and beer selection is appealing, their food is disappointing.  I could make it at home for even cheaper then 9 bucks.   Barbara needs to get picked up by a place like Postino. Her work ethic and eagerness to please the customer is better served in a place that puts effort into their food. This Postino wannabe has a pretty appealing menu with a disappointing end result.   Salut!!!!  UPDATE  I got food poisoning.  This was the last meal I ate.  I'm about 95% sure it is what caused me to get sick."}
{"text":"Just an extra update they never responded to resolve the issue. *sigh Will never go to the restaurant again"}
{"text":"Salut has good ideas for a cool modern approach on fine dining and drinking. However, their execution on this approach seemed to produce food that was pretty and cute, but did not taste good. They have a cute environment with a nice dog friendly patio and nice staff. I went to Salut for a valentine's day deal, so maybe their kitchen was just overwhelmed, but their food was overcooked, oily, and unimpressive. I look forward to the next time I go, so I can see if it has improved, but I am not enthusiastic based on my last experience."}
{"text":"If my visit had stopped with the drinks and appetizers, this would have been a 4 or 5 star review. The hummus nachos and goat cheese filled peppers are really delicious. The cocktails were good as well.  I had a skinny mojito which was spunky and refreshing.  A short while after ordering our meal we had someone tell us our food was 12 minutes out. That 12 minutes turned into over an hour. We were then told the food was put on rush, but it came out lukewarm at best. My husband's burger was tasty but was well done and he wanted it to be medium rare. I had a brie sandwich and my friend had a grilled cheese that we split. Neither were that amazing. Maybe if they have been hotter they could have been.  Our other friends got a chicken pasta dish, which they said was actually really amazing. To his credit, the manager did offer us dessert to make it right and it was good, so it shows he cares. The server was good, and nice. The main issue was just how backed up the food was. The atmosphere was really cute and charming. On a less busy night this may be a place to visit again, but most likely just for drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour, what everyone says is true! They have an amazing happy hour and nice patio. We were celebrating a birthday so we're a larger than average table. Service was great, I had the Brie sandwich with salut fries and don't know if I'll every stray from ordering that every time I come here. The s'mores dessert was very fun. Overall great experience. Only downside is parking in the shopping center isn't the best."}
{"text":"Great place for appetizers, small bites to eat with friends. I didn't try the burgers but I've heard they're great. I received great service, however, the food is a little bit more on the pricy side. I shared three appetizers with a friend and we were satisfied! Live music and a really cool ambient. We got the ravioli's, the stuffed avocado and the hummus nachos. Great for any foodie wanting to try new foods."}
{"text":"Very cool vibe!  Ashley delivered awesome service and joked around with us a bunch.  GreatIPA selection too!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch in Tempe and as a first timer was not disappointed. We went for the $5 Beer and Grilled Cheese special on Friday, which we paired with a free hummus nachos. The sandwich was basic, but tasty, and the beer was Rolling Rock. The nachos were okay, not what we were expecting, but they were free with our coupon.   Patio feels like Scottsdale and you can't even notice the busy University Drive. Well definitely be back another time for wine and smores."}
{"text":"Great place. Went there before the official opening, I think. I happened to talk to the owner while sitting at the bar who told me that they were just open for ten days. It felt like an awesome place to hang out - great atmosphere, super nice people. Really nice service - I got to try a few different wines before deciding on a glass, great cheese plate and amazing filet mignon. I had a wonderful time while in Tempe  just for work - definitely go and enjoy great drinks, fun atmosphere and people, and some good food!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch. I was kind of disappointed as I had higher expectations for the restaurant giving it was 5 stars . I had the BLT sandwich which had little bacon and the bacon was not crispy. I have the grapefruit basil martini which was pretty good. I went on a Sunday and was expecting to be able to watch my football game but they had only one game on and when I asked them to put the Steelers game on they said that they could not do it. I suppose it's because they do not have the NFL ticket so that would have been nice if they had it. I am willing to try the place again and maybe go for dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Keary was our server and was delightful! All our food was so good! Love the atmosphere here too. Dave the manager went above and beyond to make sure we were having a great time. Be sure to get the S'mores!"}
{"text":"Salut is super good! Fresh, well-made food, yummy drinks, and a pleasant ambiance. Their lemon lavender fizz drink is quite good. I can't wait to go back and try more of their food! I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The restaurant is innovative, but the food is not nearly as good as the menu appears.  Wine not to my taste. I've given the place a few tries and each time I'm just disappointed.  The service is decent and the ambiance nice.  Just wish the wine & food were more interesting."}
{"text":"I\"m in love with this place.  It was discovered by a friend who lives nearby and it's now a go to.  They have a great happy hour that lasts longer than most and offer great food deals as well as half price wine.   the hummus nachoes are outstanding, the smores desert is ridiculously fun as well as delish.  You get to roast your own smores on a little fire!    Do not get me started on that Malbec burger.  Holy.crap.  It is outstanding.  Yes, a burger infused/cooked with wine.  It's everything you'd think it would be. I\"ve never had a bad meal here at all.  The patio is fantastic as well."}
{"text":"This place has a ton of potential, think they just have to figure out who they are. When you look at website/menu, you get a real \"Mediterranean restaurant\" vibe, sign sit down tables, fresh entrees, and reasonable prices. However, when you get there, it had much more of a a bar/bbq set/up. Felt dark and tavern-like.  Having said that, the service was outstanding. We were there on a Friday night, the bartender was incredibly attentive to how we were doing and what we needed. Our server (kona, I think?) was excellent and we lacked for nothing, Our good was also extremely fresh and delicious. A few of us had one of the salads w walnuts and strawberries etc, and I split the salmon - dish was awesome, though definitely not a super generous portion.  Good place w potential to be amaaaaazing"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for breakfast, lunch or dinner! Very trendy and fun place. They have a great patio that is dog friendly. Food and drinks were really good, great customer service."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight and everything was amazing!!! Highly recommend their bruschetta. Raven was an amazing server who took great care of us and recommended a great wine. Would go back and order their tiramisus... splitting with the boyfriend was tough. A+!!!!"}
{"text":"Salut bar has been consistent with good food and great restaurant ideas like the dog friendly patio Their food is modern spin on American and Mediterranean cuisine Greek nachos are fun And their bar is pretty on point"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I've been for brunch, happy hour and dinner and I've enjoyed each meal, app and drink(s).  The staff is friendly and have made great suggestions when needed.  Have to get the Hummus nachos when you go, that's a given.  Also, they text coupons often with good deals (free hummus nachos, bogo meals, etc).  If you haven't been, you need to."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting and it was really good. The menu choice isn't huge but there's variety and a little something for everyone. The service was really good, constantly kept our waters filled and we happened to drink a lot today. I got the Mediterranean Chicken Kabab and it was cooked perfectly. The chicken was tender and juicy. It was paired well with the peppers, onions, and pita bread. We got the hummus stuffed avocado plate to share, it was like a small salad but it was it was excellent. The desserts looked good, but didn't have a chance to try them this time. Will be back for sure you try it. It is a little bit on the pricier side, but not bad overall."}
{"text":"Stopped here because the sign said burgers and we pass it everyday. We tried the hummus nachos and they were divine! I ordered the Brie Hive, based on the hostesses suggestion. I would return just for that. It was the best sandwich I have ever had. The sourdough was perfectly toasted,  the apple sliced just thick enough,  and the brie warm and soft but not runny. It was an amazing play of flavors. Husband had the Malbec burger and it was perfectly cooked, well seasoned, all around great flavors. Now as amazing as the food was Greg our server was just as amazing! I love finding new places close to home and this is definitely my new favorite!"}
{"text":"Met up with good friends over the weekend and have been past here a few times - never been in - until now!  This lace is nice - the outside area is awesome - nice views of the bar and surroundings and the environment not too noisy (which some outside bars can get)..  We started off with just wine and made our way to shared appetizers. They were really nice. However, the wines we started with were what we came for. An afternoon wine session relaxing and chatting with friends. Our friends require a gluten-free option, and this place had it pretty sorted. Nice GF options, which is always good.  We ended up drinking 3 bottles of wine over several hours and they were all great..  Definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday and enjoyed the bottomless mimosas, garlic fries and hummus nachos. Can I just say that the inventor of the hummus nacho is brilliant! Garlicky hummus on warm lightly toasted pita, with feta and pomegranate seeds...I died, so good! The garlic fries were good too, just a little greasy."}
{"text":"Five stars for service alone. And nostalgia. Boyfriend and I had our first date here last summer - I'm pretty sure our 'dinner' lasted almost five hours and even when our original server clocked out and transferred the table to the bartender, the staff was still friendly and never implied they were tired of us (I've worked in the restaurant industry for almost ten years, trust me, I know they were excited to see us go, but they never let that on!).  The food is also delicious! This is a very underrated restaurant. They have HUMMUS NACHOS. Like, come on. And the bruschetta is on point. This is truly a perfect date night spot because you can sit and sip wine and snack while enjoying the patio or inside ambiance.   I think this will be in our date night restaurant rotation for a long time, but I have also filed Salut away in my head as a good place to order food from for a party. When I reach the stage of adulthood where I actually need to hire a caterer, this place is on my radar!"}
{"text":"So my husband and I decided to try thus place out, since we found a great deal on Groupon and the yelp reviews were good. The groupon deal was $32 for an alcohol beverage, a choice of burger or sandwich,  with fries or a salad. This is really a good deal and the food was super yummy.  I definitely plan on coming back here in the near future.  They have daily happy hour deals & reverse happy hour too. Awsome atmosphere to take a group of friends or family or even date night.  The servers are fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Came here at 2pm on a Wednesday and had an amazing experience! Great drinks, good food, and extremely personable service. Erin is da bomb!"}
{"text":"First off, solid choice for date night.  Good beers and they have good wines for a good price.  They always have some sort of special going on. Location is easy to get to and is far enough away from the ASU chaos.  Staff was very polite and on their game.  For an appetizer, we had the gluten free bruschetta.  Pretty tough to come by and I'm thankful they unlike so many other places have it.  I ordered the panini and very good flavor.  The Salut fries are hate them or love them and I so happen to love them. Overall, I was very pleased with my choice to come here and I happily go every other week or so when I want a nice chill place to have some good food and a glass of wine.  Cheers"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this small family owned restaurant.  They provide Gluten Free options for my wife as she has celiacs.  Katie is the best server and bar tender.  Try the salut fries and the bruschetta- it is amazing.   Still think the need get 4peaks on tap - other than that everything is great!"}
{"text":"So good amazing drinks. Great service. I had dinner on the dog friendly patio and the atmosphere was relaxing and romantic cozy and warm. My food was delicious, I would definitely consider this good prices fine dining. After dinner I had a drink at their inside bar and the drink was outstanding. Ask for the mixologist, Will Brazil. Ask him to make you something tasty!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last weekend and hit it on restaurant week.  The food and wine were good, and service was good...solid, but not fabulous.  We ordered off of the restaurant week menu; the salad I had with strawberries and goat cheese was very good and a generous portion.  My dining partner had bruschetta and enjoyed both pieces, also a generous portion.  In fact, all portion sizes were generous.  We both opted for pistachio crusted salmon, which was tasty.  Loved the asparagus as well.  Dessert was good, though they did run out of the dessert that was on the restaurant week menu (I didn't want to make a deal out of it, but that was a big part of the menu attraction, and I'm not big on many desserts).  They did give us our choice of other desserts and what we had (s'mores and cheesecake) were good.  The wine was also good.  The meal was good, don't get me wrong.  I just wasn't quite \"wowed\" though I'd likely come back and give it another go."}
{"text":"Meant to stop in for happy hour apps and cocktail, but instead tried their Restaurant Week $30 three-course menu (app, entree, and dessert) and a glass of house wine (cabernet or pinot grigio), or draft.  I decided to try the Goat cheese-stuffed Peppadews, the Malbec burger (comes with Salut fries), and Chocolate cake, with a glass of cabernet to compliment the burger.  I've had peppadews stuffed with goat cheese before (at Fez), so I knew these would be tasty.  The peppers were raw (as opposed to the roasted peppadews at Fez, or that's how I recall them to be, anyway), so they added crunch to the experience, and were stuffed with a sweetened goat cheese filling, then sprinkled with herbs and drizzled with a very mild-tasting vegetable oil.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=H7ExguXj2xipVp4CTDxM4Q#H7ExguXj2xipVp4CTDxM4Q  I ate two of the four peppadews (to pace myself for the coming burger and dessert...).  I ordered the Malbec burger without mushrooms and tomatoes (allergies), and while Maham forgot to ask how I liked the temperature, she said she asked for medium (\"red in the center\"), but the burger arrived without any hints of pinkness at all.  However, it was still juicy and tender.  The bun was good- looked and tasted like it may be supplied from a local bakery.  Without the mushrooms and tomatoes to temper the sweetness from the caramelized onions, this burger tasted almost too sweet.  No matter- I just took a few Salut fries, shoestring fries topped with feta and parmesan, which leant the saltiness to counter the sweet onions.  Loved the citrus vinaigrette drizzle on the fries- YUM!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=AiLPBPynnsej5zssNM6x1g#AiLPBPynnsej5zssNM6x1g  For dessert, I had my choice of S'mores, cheesecake, or chocolate cake, and I almost can never say no to chocolate cake, especially when the description mentions a drizzle of both chocolate and white chocolate sauces, but as you can see, my dessert only came with a dark chocolate drizzle.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=58Yym4133_Nrx9H61x2M4A#58Yym4133_Nrx9H61x2M4A  My sadness was only fleeting, as I tasted my first bite... oh, this cake tasted definitely of homemade dark chocolate batter, sauce, and ganache filling and frosting!  (No use of powdered sugar, cornstarch, or corn syrup- I asked!)  One of the best-tasting chocolate layered cakes I've tasted in a long time, complete with semi-sweet mini-chocolate chips on the outside edge...  Not very sweet, so I ate about half of it- oops!  :)  I hadn't planned on participating in Restaurant Week this season, but I'm glad to be able to recommend Salut's participation.  Thank you, Salut and Maham, for making RW fun again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service on a Saturday morning brunch! I had the biscuits and beer chorizo gravy. It had a nice kick and tasted delicious. My friend got a panini with a side of potatoes which were  also pretty amazing. Toss in some fresh squeezed orange juice and I'm a happy customer. Ambiance is nice. Outdoor patio is well shaded, but beware sitting by the flowers, there are lots of flies."}
{"text":"Honestly I am shocked by all the good reviews for this restaurant, my experience here was one of the worst I've ever had. Maybe we just came on an incredibly bad day, but it was so bad I would never ever return.   We came for brunch on a Sunday, it wasn't crowded but we still had to wait for a table on the patio. We waited about 10 minutes just for a table to be cleared. While we were waiting, literally next to the hostess stand, another couple walked in and the hostess seated them immediately at the table we were promised and waiting on. It was incredibly awkward pointing that out to the hostess then having to watch her make the people leave the table. Just the beginning of a horrible experience.   Our server, I never caught his name, provided the worst service I've ever received at a restaurant. It took him over 20 minutes just to bring us waters. By that time we were ready to order. We ordered 3 coffees and 3 of us got omelettes and 1 got a skillet.   There must have been something wrong with the coffee maker or it was just old coffee because when it arrived it was not even hot, it was cold and filled with coffee grounds. We never even got the opportunity to let the server know since he then disappeared for 45 minutes! The people around us also looked extremely angry, if I hadn't already ordered we would have left.   After waiting over an hour the food arrived. My vegetable omelette was the driest, saddest excuse for an omelette I've ever eaten. The vegetables inside were 100% raw, raw spinach, raw onion, that's not an omelette. The eggs were chalky and there's no way that omelette was made with real eggs. They tasted like powdered eggs. It was disgusting. I ate literally 1 bite. But once again I couldn't send it back because our server was NO WHERE in sight. Never checked on us to see if the food was okay, no coffee refills, just dropped the check off another 45 minutes later. It ended up being almost a 3 hour brunch and not by choice, that's how slow this service was.   Also the flys on the patio were unbearable which was just the cherry on top of this horrendous experience. I don't know how the food is for dinner, but skip the brunch it's disgusting and slow."}
{"text":"Close to Mill without the parking hassle & with a slightly older crowd. The food is decent, fresh, & reasonably priced. The mixed drinks are dangerously good - we could've sipped the one with Peach whisky all day. The patio is dog-friendly & good for small or large groups. I like the hand-made feel with the pallet furniture."}
{"text":"Service is always amazing. Food is one of a kind. The dining experience you get when you eat at a place like Salut is like no other. 100% recommend. If you're lucky you'll get Tyler as your server. Without a doubt you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Was searching for somewhere new to check out before our matinee show at Gammage. This place popped up on yelp so we decided to give it a shot. First off, they have bottomless mimosas which was awesome! The brunch menu had a ton of yummy items on it, but we settled on the farmhouse omelette and chicken pita. The chicken pita was quite delicious, but wasn't in love with the french fries. Would love to come back to partake in some day drinking on the patio and try one of the other delicious items on the menu.   I also love the woodwork and design of this restaurant. It is very unique and adds quite a bit to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is always a great place for brunch! Bottomless penny mimosas and excellent service! Hannah was a great server! She let us move to avoid the air vents and kept our glasses full. I'm definitely returning!"}
{"text":"Salut   We had breakfast here on a Sunday. We sat inside. It was a little chilly outside but there was already a crowd enjoying the patio. The food items on the menu are limited but this is a restaurant with multiple drink menus. The decor is trendy and inviting. This is a very cute wine bar. They have these amazing mirrors framed in cut wine bottles. I loved the mirrors.   For breakfast I just had coffee and water but the brunch cocktails were very tempting. The water they serve is infused with cucumbers and very refreshing. I love the cut wine bottle drinking glasses. I ordered the Florentine Benedict to share. I usually find eggs Benedict so heavy that I can only eat half of a two egg portion. At Salut the portions are fancy and small. I could have eaten the whole meal and then some. Good thing we ordered an extra side of fruit and that we were trying not to overeat.    The funny thing is that we did order a breakfast dessert. It is fun to be on vacation. For dessert we had the chef's special dessert it was a French toast with banana ice cream. It was tasty but I could have gone without it.   This is a great spot to go for a drink and a fancy snack. Just don't go to Salut expecting or wanting big food portions.   If I lived in the area I would definitely come back to Salut. It looks like they have some great wine specials. They also have a nice patio and bar. Salut has a lot going for it. I am glad I got the chance to have a meal here."}
{"text":"A must try for great food and service. Good happy hour and great service. We are looking forward to going back to try other items."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to review this place for ages and just remembered on the chance that I couldn't sleep! My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE this place - we have even found a favorite server, Raven, who remembered us on our second visit. The staff we have encountered have ALL been absolutely incredible especially management. I am vegetarian and they are always super accommodating and actually want to make sure I leave happy even though their menu has a lot of meat on it. The manager on shift has checked every  time to make absolutely certain that I got my order the way it was supposed to be. ((My favorite is the Malbec Burger sub the burger for avocado.)) We are also very partial to the mac and cheese bites as well as the hummus nachos and salut fries. I can't stand sitting outside (not just here, pretty much anywhere) but the patio is beautiful and dog friendly, which is awesome! The whole restaurant has a very good vibe and is an easy place to relax and eat a good meal for a good price for what you get. I also absolutely can't stand waiting and I think the longest I've waited here was about 5 minutes because their restaurant is so large! I have only come during dinner hours so I intend to visit for lunch to see if I see the same amazing results! (I'm sure I will). Nothing bad to say about this place ever. Keep doing exactly what you are doing, Salut!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. Food was great! Hummus nachos, yum. Italian panini sandwich was great too, but the fries on the side were loaded in pepper. That was the only bad thing.  We used a Groupon and had no problems using it.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Salut definitely deserves a 5 start review! The service (Will the bartender) was outstanding with recommendations. The Hummus Nachos were delicious - we had to get a 2nd order! My group and I ordered a little of everything and enjoyed it all. The General Manager, Bill, stopped by to see how we were and what we thought of the food and the service with sincere interest. I highly recommend Salut! I look forward to coming back and enjoy their patio - looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Great reverse happy hour spot.  It was a little warm outside but we opted to dine on the patio since it was a bit busy inside. There was only one other table outside so it was nice. We were going to have a glass of wine each, but the waiter persuaded to get a bottle since it was half off - plus he said we could take it home if we didn't finish it. Sold!  The waiter was great. He was fun to chat with, wasn't overbearing, but always there for refill our waters and make sure everything was good.   It took a little while for the food to come out, but we were enjoying the weather and our bottle of wine. We ordered hummus nachos & bruschetta to start. For our entrees, we ordered the quinoa bowl and roasted corn bowl. Everything was really good so it made the wait worth while."}
{"text":"Great place!  We loved the patio!  Julia was an amazing hostess/server and took great care of us!  This is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"We had a pleasant New Year's Day brunch at Salut. The patio is large and dog-friendly so we sat outside on a spacious table with Grace O.'s super cute pug and company :).  After browsing through the menu I decided on the farmhouse omelet with ranch dusted potatoes. The omelet was filled with well seasoned and tender vegetables but the scrambled egg was overcooked and thus a little tough. I loved the potatoes. They were lightly crisp, perfectly tender on the inside and the ranch \"dust\" gave the potatoes a whole new dimension of flavor. I also had some of the hummus nachos which had smooth creamy hummus with crisp, slightly chewy pita triangles. The balsamic vinegar drizzle on top was a great touch.  Service was friendly and warm. Our server was spot on with refilling coffee and water.  It was chilly and a little rainy outside and while there are heaters outside they still weren't powerful enough to keep me feeling comfortable sitting outside. By the time we were finished with our meals my feet felt frozen.  I definitely want to come back with my pups but on a warmer day. Until next time, Salut!"}
{"text":"My experience here was wonderful. Second time customer. What a great gastro pub! The bartender Nathan was very knowledgeable about wine and gave great food recommendations! A friend and I ordered off of happy hour and left full and happy. They were out of the ricotta ravioli so the manager came to ask what we would like instead. The chef improvised an amazing pasta dish for us to share the was rich and full of flavor.  We will be back! Great service and this place was very welcoming!"}
{"text":"Kori and Will were Amazing today! They were there before we knew we needed service. We are out here for spring training and we were pampered. We started out at another brunch place but decided to come here.  Not only was the staff amazing, but the food was unforgettable. I recommend this place x200"}
{"text":"I came here on a work trip and enjoyed the experience.  It was pretty busy, but I was seated and served right away.  My server was pleasant and attentive.  I didn't have to wait long for my food or drink.  I had a moscow mule, it was done well and was refreshing.  I wasn't feeling an entree so I had the salut sampler appetizer plate.  Everything on it was fairly tasty.  The salut fries and quinoa fritters were the stand outs.  The hummus nachos and mac and cheese balls were okay.   I'd revisit this place."}
{"text":"Wait staff were funny, polite, and did a great job answering all our questions.  We did unfortunately order the Bruschetta and was very disappointed.  it was bread, like sandwich bread!  Lightly toasted bread,.  I'm not Italian but was expecting toasted bread with some taste with a little oil and salt maybe.  Anyway, a bit disappointed.  Waiters --- Brandon and Tyler represented Salut Kitchen very well."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for dinner last night and it was AMAZING! The salmon with pistachios was unreal!!! Don't get me started on the S'mores! #heaven! We will definitely be back soon...oh and great music too!"}
{"text":"Salut Kitchen and Bar is my new favorite place! Not only do they have the best bottomless mimosas but the best staff! Tyler was outstanding and I will be requesting his section next time I go."}
{"text":"The servers here need better training. The resultant was not busy and we sat there for 40 minutes after she took our plates away and she never came back. Called someone else over for our bill. We wanted to split the bill between two people and he ended up ringing the same card two times..."}
{"text":"Not a good showing of food for Restaurant Week last week.  Sounded good but execution was not good. We had 3 people and tried all 9 items (3 appetizers, 3 entree, and 3 deserts).    Appetizers - 2 misses Pork wings were the best but nothing to write home about or order a second time.  Humus bland and nothing special. Worth $3 on a regular menu Mac bites = blah and not worthy of being on a $44 menu  Entree - 2 misses Salmon meal was over cooked  Gnocchi was the best offering by far.  Filet mignon was ok but the served it with a really bad sauce.  Desert - 2 misses S'mores I saw another table call the manager over to complain and we did not order it.  The peach sorbet - it home made, but lacked pizzazz of a restaurant week three course meal finisher.  The other desert was their best, but was still a $4-5 desert.   While good I can not remember what it was really so enough said there.   They were not busy but the food was backed up. 75% empty building with no one at the bar.   Maybe 1 person.   While the restaurant was not busy the manager on duty could still not find time to stop and ask how the food was even during restaurant week.  There were 2 prices for restaurant week in the valley ($33 and $44). Their food was almost worthy of the $33 price, but they went with $44.   I had heard good things of this place but food did not pan out very well. The drinks were good. I had a thyme fig  Martini that was good and I do recommend it. That is why there are 2 stars on my visit.   Drinks = 4 star. Food  = 1-2 stars. Service = 2"}
{"text":"I always go there for food, and never tried their drinks. The food was a little slow, but they are good! Worth the wait."}
{"text":"First time visiting..The service was horrible! Our waitress was not personable & very awkward.. We even had to chase her down for our tab after waiting 15-20 minutes. We also ordered bruschetta which had a hair in it. They did get us a \"new one\" which came out 2 minutes later. Very unimpressed! I will not be returning or referring this restaurant to anybody!"}
{"text":"Perhaps it was a bad night but Salut underwhelmed me. The menu was pricy and I expected so much more. The wine pour was not generous. I assumed a $14 salad to have freshly made ingredients. Instead, the chicken was cold. The egg was clearly over-cooked, and so was the replacement they brought me. My date's food was tasty, but portion was small and the chicken was very dry. Overall: patio was pretty nice, service was decent, food was overpriced and not very tasty. Drink prices were high too. This may be a place worth visiting during happy hour, but not dinner time."}
{"text":"I moved here from Texas less than three weeks ago and have to say that this has become one of my favorite places! Incredible food and great atmosphere! Great place for those needing gluten-free options and its dog friendly!! The menu has a great mix, whether you're craving a healthy salad with a nice glass of wine or a bacon grilled cheese with a beer. Jean Pierre is wonderful! Very personable, attentive and helpful! The management always stops by to check in, but no one hovers around your table."}
{"text":"Amazing bar ever!!! The decor, the lighting, but especially the service. Brian the bartender was excellent, very knowledgable, very suggestive on drinks and a great personality. This is a must place to visit."}
{"text":"So I am officially obsessed, considering I have been here two more times since my last review. My only two complaints after a total of 3 visits are that the booths are very small and if you sit outside there is a slight fly problem. But otherwise the food and service has always been on point.   As far as drinks go, I've had The Salut, Oh Honey!, and Bird Call, all of which I enjoyed.   Bruschetta I've had the pesto, chicken & hummus, sriracha blt, and roasted garlic. My favorites so far are the chicken & hummus and the pesto.   Food wise I've had the Malbec and Sriracha burger. The Malbec burger is SO.GOOD. Like stop what you're doing, drive to Salut and get it good. Last night I had the sriracha which was good, don't get me wrong, but the combination of flavors in the Malbec is so bomb. I also prefer the regular fries to the salut fries because I like to dip in ketchup but to each their own."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since I live really close to it and it has yet to disappoint me. I usually go in for their great drink specials and their happy hour but recently I went in and had some food. Their food is great! I recommend the \"Hummus Nachos\". The staff is super friendly and the owners are great guys.   The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly and a big difference from other Tempe area bars and eateries.  If you want the quality and service of Scottsdale but with a more laid back down to earth atmosphere then Salut is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Salut is my favorite place to go on the weekends. Their bottomless mimosas are amazing, and Will has always kept ours full while working. So worth the $18!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been here a few times for brunch, lunch, and dinner. I would highly recommend being adventurous during brunch time here! The chicken and waffles are awesome and the sandwiches are great. The whole place has a great vibe, and it's never too busy.  I've been here for a birthday brunch, too, and the staff has always been very attentive and responsive. The staff is a ton of fun and even played a game of Heads Up with us after we finished up brunch.  As many have said before, the hummus nachos are to die for. Seriously though, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. It's definitely a favorite joint of mine in Tempe, and the patio area is the perfect place to spend recovering from a hangover on a late Sunday afternoon if you feel like being a little classier than normal."}
{"text":"Found this place when I was looking for happy hours around my corporate office that is located near Sky Harbor airport and this is now going to be my go to spot for after our quarterly meetings !    I always hate going places around Tempe for the parking and too many college kids but this place is fantastic ! Parking is so easy and there was a good variety of different age groups there. They have a cute patio that is pet friendly !   My friend and I sat at the bar and the bartender ( I didn't catch his name) was very friendly and attentive. He was helpful when we were picking out cocktails . She got the spicy berry margarita and I got the fig and thyme. We both said our drinks were very different , unlike something we have ever ordered , but we liked that ! They were tasty ! we also ordered the hummus nachos with cucumber; delish and light. We also couldn't help ourselves and ordered the Fudge lava divine and it was divine. This is definitely for a chocolate lover! It is very rich but was just what we needed .   My co workers and I will ABSOLUTELY be back and I can't wait to try out more on the menu, all looked delicious and I know their service will always be great !"}
{"text":"Wow, what an incredible addition to Tempe! First time here and within about 20 min it was obvious Salut has captured the perfect combination of amazing atmosphere (sophisticated yet relaxed!), amazing service (they work as a team that's impossibly attentive, yet not overbearing!), amazing food (creative, well-crafted, fresh, tasty and inexpensive), and amazing cocktails (creative, well-crafted, fresh, tasty and inexpensive).  If you are getting the impression that we were totally impressed, you're wrong. We were blown away.  Manager Brandon is fantastic. Charismatic,  friendly, generous, genuine (yet humble and not full-of-himself or his bar)! Where else does this happen?!?  Bartenders Zac, David and Taso were equally awesome and accommodating.  We had the Malbec Turkey Burger with bacon and Greek salad, and the Grilled Chicken Panini with Bacon and Regular Fries.  Believe it or not, they offer to sell (and actually do! - someone bought one of their cool glasses when we were here) everything in the bar. Why? Because everything in there super unique and creative.  They even have wine cork hangers under the bar for purses -- and more importantly (to me), a USB strip all along the bottom side of the bar - and they have every phone charger cord behind the bar to loan you too!  They have a decent amount of indoor and outdoor HDTVs. If you're cool, they may even ask you to autograph a wine cork for their wall!!  Happy Hour 7 days a week 3pm-6:30pm. $3.50 wells, $5 wine, $4 beers, $5 cocktails as well as food specials. Reverse happy hour Sun-Thur 9-11pm. PLUS daily specials (I.e., $5 martinis on Wed).   Patio is great and huge. Hostesses are friendly too. Heck, at this point in the review you'd expect nothing less.  Do yourself a favor. Come here. Sit at the bar. You'll be blown-away by what happens next.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Okay, a few months later, and I'm still a Salut regular- but I feel the need to update my review.  My biggest issue with Salut at this point is the lack of consistency - which has basically been a problem since they opened. I used to give them the benefit of the doubt as a \"new restaurant,\" but by now they've been around for almost 2 years, and I expect the same experience every time I go. Don't get me wrong, it's usually still good - but sometimes it's not, and that's an issue.   First - this restaurant has more waitstaff turnover then I've ever seen. Like I said, my boyfriend and I are definitely regulars, and maybe 2 servers recognize us. We have a new server nearly every time we go. Next - STOP CHANGING THE MENU. I get that some things are less popular, but honestly it's so frustrating. I used to be able to get a turkey burger, and now my option is bison - for a few bucks more? Meh. Last but not least, I stand by my opinion that the food is overpriced for the portion size. You're not a 5-star restaurant, so when I pay $13 for a salad I expect it to be pretty big, or $9 for the hummus nachos appetizer, I expect more than 5 smallish pita slices.   Honestly, I want Salut to be great. I want to keep loving it. But it's almost to the point where I'll drive the 10 extra minutes to Postino when I feel like wine & light eats - I know everything there is the same, every time."}
{"text":"My girlfriend suggested Salut for lunch the other day and while it was a charming place (located in the old ichi ban), I think I would reserve it for happy hour and pass on lunch. It was pretty pricey and not very busy so a group happy hour with cheaper prices may be the way to go.   I started with the quinoa fritters - basically fried balls of heaven. Take quinoa and mix it with havarti and red onion and top with a red pepper emulsion and fried, sliced crimini mushrooms. They were delicious!  We split the burger and while it was good it was nothing spectacular. The side of fries was not friendly to my taste buds, they were covered in feta and lemon juice... Not tasty.   While I was there I noticed the daily drink specials on the wall along with some awesome happy hour specials. They have free wifi and a dog friendly patio. May not be in my go to lunch spot but I would put it in rotation for happy hour in Tempe."}
{"text":"I met some friends here on a Saturday morning. We sat outside and it was lovely. I got the Farmhouse omelette and loved every bite. They each got the Eggs Benedict and seemed to enjoy them. The omelette was fresh and flavorful. The hashbrown were just the kind I like, thinly sliced and had a great brown crisp on the top. Our server was a bit bummed we didn't order bottomless mimosas, so he didn't pay too good of attention to us. Plus, every time we got our coffee refilled, it was only warm. We brought it to their attention and they seemed surprised, but took forever to brew a new pot and get our cups refilled. Stars for the food and ambiance."}
{"text":"Darin was by far one of the best servers we have ever had. Such a positive attitude and loved talking to him! Would definitely go back just to have him serve us again...and we got the s'mores which were amazing :) Thank you Darin!"}
{"text":"Came here on a date and it was cute. Don't always frequent that way but it was cute. Are server was amazing and has a great personality which is always a plus: they also allow dogs on the patio which is a great perk/ and what I find more cute is that they take a pic of your pup and put it up on the doggie wall! I recommend for a casual HH or a date .   Enjoy"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The atmosphere is trendy and fun and the food is good. They have buy a bottle of wine and get one for $1...which is AMAZING for happy hour. You can make your own smores for dessert which is always fun. Everyone and I mean EVERYONE that works there was super friendly! This is my new hangout spot."}
{"text":"Salut has its ups and downs. I actually do recomend this place for some drinks and appetizers. Its also good if you have some people who are vegetarian they have many options for them while still having a good variety of burgers and sandwiches. I unfortunately have not been thrilled with the entres I got the last few times ive come including the chicken sandwich which I got this last time which was a bit dry. But I would still come for their apps and happy hour."}
{"text":"Great dinner. Hummus nachos were amazing as well as everything we ordered. Would drive from Gilbert to Tempe for the truffle fries any time.."}
{"text":"A wonderful find and great beginning to our vacation. Kona was our server and was extremely pleased to have us as his guests. It was obvious that he takes pride in his service and the delicious food that Salut has to offer.   He was generous in his suggestions and very knowledgeable about the menu and food allergies.   Lavender Fizz is my new favorite drink!   Hummus Nachos were a surprising delight and the Truffle Fries were delish. My husband was thrilled with his Salmon Fettuccine Alfredo. I found the Quinoa Bowl with chicken to be very satisfying.   All-in-all, the best dining experience we've had in a long time! Go dine/drink and have a great experience. Ask for Kona!"}
{"text":"The food is good. Not worth as much as the prices. The happy hour is mediocre, taking two dollars off of appetizers and drinks isn't really that great of a happy hour. The drinks were also mediocre."}
{"text":"Extremely dog friendly, good food, and strong mimosas! Will be back with my pup, for sure."}
{"text":"Had such a great time here! Came in for my friends birthday dinner and they accommodated our large group and got us seated right away. We arrived cut off time to their happy hour which was $2 off tapas and beer/wine. I got the caprese salad to start which is always a great choice! the waitress and her shadow were awesome! They were able to redeem the Yelp check in deal for $2 glass of wine and made excellent suggestions on drinks and shots for the birthday girl! She loved everything the bartender came up with :) the food came out quick and tasted delicious! I got the Brie Hive which is like a bruschetta sandwich and their Salut fries were bomb.com my girlfriend got the Cobb salad which was delicious! Everyone loved what they ordered and I just truly enjoyed how attentive the staff was to check on our table :) they diy smores treat was a great way to end the evening and they were nice enough to hold the door on the way out! Love love love it. Will absolutely be coming back and recommending to my friends! Thanks a lot ! :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I came to Salut for her birthday and enjoyed brunch with bottomless mimosas.  The server Tyler recommended the Chorizo Beer Fries and they were amazing!  This restaurant has a unique ambiance and I would definitely recommend it to family/friends."}
{"text":"This place is more for a younger hipster crowd, however the drink selection is a bit off the beaten path and quite varied. My personal favorite are the hummus bites with pomegranate. Delicious. I've always had outstanding service here as well."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new in Tempe and was extremely happy with this place! The food is awesome, the ambiance is cool and the staff is very helpful and friendly! I think I just found my new favorite spot in tempe!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Nice atmosphere, great menu, patio is nice and casual-bonus that its dog friendly, even though I don't bring my dogs. Hummus nachos are great. Chicken kabobs soooo good. This is a great place for any occasion."}
{"text":"Salut is a modern, American twist with Italian eatery. They have a brunch special on the weekend which I recommend. And daily specials for whichever you stop by on the day of the week. I've had two dishes so far and been here almost 5 times? Okay? Maybe 3 but it's still wanting me to come more and more. They have unique special items of course. I've specifically had the chicken pita, which is grilled chicken breast onions and well let's not get into details but it was good and for 2 dollars more why not add salute fries which is their special side of fries not any normal thin cut fries they are seasoned with parmesan and other goodie seasoning! But Definitely check this place out they have a dog friendly patio, nice decor and pleasant service."}
{"text":"Went here because it seems that everyone said it was a great place for Happy Hour.  So we showed up at 5pm. ( Thursday) no one on the patio. Maybe 15 people total inside.  Water was served. Looking at the Happy Hour menu..... really nothing great. $11 dollars a drink... with $2 off? Really? Okay the 1/2 off bottle of wine is a good deal.... but if you don't drink wine... it's not.  Had the Bruschetta.. choose 4 for $16. They were good. ( not great).  Service was spotty. So 4 drinks and one appetizer later... and a $54 bill... we went to Bar Louie! Happy Hour awesome! $5.50 martinis! Huge glasses.. not the small teeny martini glasses at Salut. ( for $9) Oh and I got the same thing from server..... the kitchen is backed up.. do you want to put an order in. Really? Place was empty!"}
{"text":"Foods okay but could be better for the price. When you pay $15 for a Cobb salad I expect the avocado to be ripe and $11 for a weak mixed drink is disappointing."}
{"text":"Definitely if I ever come back to Arizona this is the spot. Food was amazing! And the presentation as well as our server Kaitlin was the sweetest and the best. Overall great experience :)"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Tempe for lunch and happy hour. Incredible food and incredible people which leads to an incredible atmosphere. Doesn't get any better"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great atmosphere, great food, great beers, and cool drinks.  They seem to have some great happy hour specials but brunch is where it's at.  We'll be back for the grill cheese and beer thingie too."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for dinner.  We went and had drinks and a large selection of appetizers and their bruschetta. I loved about 90% of it. Flute cocktails were fantastic and the lavender lemon drink is a must try.  The pizookie dessert was not up to par compared to the rest of the meal."}
{"text":"We came by on a Sunday, 430 pm ish.   There was a painting class going on in the outdoor patio area.  I prefer eating inside, so that was great!  Our server Dylan was super friendly and attentive and helpful.  Since we were there during happy hour, all the starters were $2 off.  And the Yelp app was great because I was able to get a glass of wine for $2!   (Mind you, it was a small amount in a too big glass, but for $2!)  The muscato was nice.  I don't usually drink but I couldn't pass on the price.        We had the 4 bruschetta for $13 and the choices I made were 2 \"Caprese Bruschetta\", a Sriracha BLT Bruschetta and a Fig Bruschetta.  The bruschetta bread did not seem grilled at all.  I think if they'd been lightly toasted it would have been better.  I didn't care for the Sriracha BLT one, and loved the flavors of the Fig one.  And Caprese, in any form is always a bit of heaven.  (and it being an appetizer, it was $2 off during the Happy Hour).    We also had the Bacon Chestnuts with honey!  Could have eaten a couple of dozen of those!       Betty got the BACON GRILLED CHEESE sandwich...(Apple wood smoked bacon and tomato between melted cheddar and provolone on honey butter toasted sourdough with garlic aioli.)   To my partner this was GREAT!  I had a taste and it reminded me of having a honey mustard flavor... not bad, but not what I was thinking for the description.  The SALUT fries that came with it were pretty darn good.  We always prefer shoestring fries and this was a wonderful twist on seasoning them.      My main meal was the bruschetta, but we and we also got a hummus platter that had pita bread, two kinds of hummus, carrots, celery and cucumber.  Even though the waiter said the garlic hummus was an old family recipe of the cook / or owner... it wasn't my style of hummus.  The other hummus was spicy and depending on what bite the heat varied.  Really, it could be me!      I would definitely check them out after looking at the online menu to see if it looks good to you.   We were really glad to have tried it and most likely go back!"}
{"text":"As a first timer- how could I decide when the menu was a list of to-dos? I picked the sampler to start, of course! The Salut Sampler included a tease of caprese salad, hummus nachos, quinoa fritters, mac & cheese bites and salut fries. The hummus nachos served on a pita with balsamic and a bite of red onion were a close winner, but the battered mac and cheese bites took the crown.  The masterpiece was actually the Bacon Grilled Cheese sandwich with applewood smoked bacon- whatever I write will be understated. The server- Glenn- added to the ambience.  He was relaxed, polite and appropriately attentive.  I like the implementation of technology:  I was impressed that my order was placed at the table on the server's tablet, leaving no doubt the expediency of the kitchen's service. My card was run in front of me at the time I presented it- saving my time and no doubt Glenn's. David, the manager, popped by to meet and greet, solidifying a comfortable and authentic experience. I look forward to many returns - I hope you also enjoy your dining experience too."}
{"text":"Tried Salut Kitchen Bar during restaurant week, and loved it! The menu is creative, classy, somewhat health-conscious, and delicious. Had the bruschetta, salmon, then a mascarpone berry thing for dessert. The serving staff were also friendly and helpful. I would definitely go back. Great meal."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the menu... Closer to overpriced bar food. Was not at all what I expected. Service was good and I was able to make reservations online."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times, this place started out strong when it first opened.  Very stylish look with reclaimed wood accents, a nice bar and a large covered patio.  The menu offers a wide selection of wines/beers and well crafted food dishes to match.  However the last few times I've been the quality of the food and focus/atmosphere has really deteriorated.  You get the feeling it's trying to be everything to everyone(ie: Oreo pancakes for brunch?!?) instead of focusing on the strengths.    Too bad cause this place is biking distance from my house and it could have been my goto spot."}
{"text":"We chose Salut for a Book Club get- together and it was great.  My only complaint was that we didn't have a ton of room and it was a little loud to hear everyone in our group. The food was great and so were the drinks.  I especially loved the smores! The decor is great as well."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with friends last night (party of 7) and enjoyed a nice evening out.  The service was a little slow, had to wait a while to get our drink order in although they did bring water out right away.  We started out with the hummus nachos and they were very tasty.  My husband who doesn't like hummus had two.    He had the Malbec Burger and upgraded the patty to bison.  He said it was delicious.  He also got the Salut Fries which were very tasty.  I had the Sun Devil Turkey Burger w/out the bun.  The turkey had a little bit of a kick to it which i liked a lot.  The only minus was that I asked for no onion and there was on hidden underneath the lettuce and wrapped up.  I almost took a bite of it.  Close call but my keen senses helped me to avoid disaster.  Also, a note about auto-gratuity...if you have a party of 6 or more they add 18% gratuity but for some reason it is noted on the receipt by the server and not added into the total.  So I calculated the split check amounts including the gratuity and noted on the receipt which card to charge which amount.  The server let me know that we couldn't do it that way - we had to charge the amount without the tip and then add the tip.  Which he let me know 3 times, was merely a suggestion and that we could tip more if we'd like.  I get it dude, this is not my first rodeo.  Repeatedly asking for a bigger tip has never inspired me to dig into my wallet.  Not once.    Other than the snafu with the check at the end a very pleasant evening and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a cool place.  They allow dogs on the patio and while I don't own a dog, I love meeting dogs, so I like this.  The drinks are not cheap, but a bottomless Mimosa is a little under $20.  On this particular visit I was disappointed in the slow service and the cold food.  That is a bad combo.  I don't mind waiting for my food, but it better be because they are waiting for it to be made, not made waiting for the server.  Hard to make a positive review with cold food.  The drinks took a long time too so it was not isolated.  Past visits were better in this regard though.  I give 3 stars instead of 2 because of past positive visits, and for the cool patio dog policy."}
{"text":"Had a really good first visit here. The wife and I each got a burger and a cocktail based on having a Groupon. She got the Sun Devil burger with fries and I got the Malbec burger off a recommendation of the waitress - mine was pretty amazing. Both drinks, mi amor specifically were great. Desert of s'mores to top it off were a perfect ended for the evening. Fun vibe, good food, awesome."}
{"text":"3 for the food, 5 for the wonderful service and awesome atmosphere. You can even bring your pups here! Check in for a $2 glass of wine. I had the rustic Cobb. Drenched in dressing, but a good and tasty salad. I'll just get the dressing on the side next time."}
{"text":"Met a friend here on the way from Austin to CA.  Holy crap.  The salmon egg salad thing with mind blowing potatoes was to die for.  Kind of wish I lived closer.  The service was so friendly.  Really fun dog friendly place.  My frenchie loved it!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with Salut. I don't often go to restaurants in Tempe, but I was happy I gave this one a try. My date and I started off with drinks and the hummus nachos. We both loved the nachos, they were served on a very tasty pita with a lot of flavor. We also split a burger and fries that was cooked perfectly. For dessert we had the s'mores, which I thought was very interesting, everyone has had s'mores, but rarely do you have the chance to order them when eating out. Overall, I liked the decor of the restaurant and thought the service was on point. Even though it's right near ASU, it wasn't your typical college hang out, which was nice when you're going on a date. I'd definitely go back to try some of the other dishes I saw at different tables."}
{"text":"Came here for my sisters last minute birthday get together.. They had very friendly staff that checked up on us often .. And we made just in time for happy hour which ends at 6:30.. The food was pretty good, I just ordered a Cobb salad with wine and the orange blossom beer.. And I got a chicken sandwich to go for my boyfriend which he enjoyed.. Everyone at the table were satisfied with their meals.. We ordered my sister a few shots on recommendations from our waiter .. They were nice enough to put one of the shots on their tab for my sister since it was her birthday.. They also brought out a DIY smores dessert for a birthday treat.. I'll defin will be back.."}
{"text":"I have been on the hunt for a decent breakfast/brunch place in the greater Phoenix area ever since moving to this megalopolis. Unfortunately, most places serve the standard fare that never excites or inspires. For mediocre omelettes, eggs, and potatoes, I can cook at home (ashamedly, I still haven't mastered the nuances of the American breakfast to my liking). But now that Salut is serving brunch (and this is a recent development), I consider dining here for that late lazy Sunday calorie-bomb a real treat!  I sniffed out this joint through New Times' Chow Bella blog and couldn't get the imagery of its menu items out of my head. Oreo pancakes? For reals? Cinnamon Toast Crunch chicken and waffles? Strange and subtle twists on the traditional breakfast appear to be afoot. With a pumped up notion of myself, I finally trotted this place out to my broheimers after failing miserably in the past to provide impressive local brunchy options. Salut did not disappoint! We had a wonderful dining experience that is sure to repeat itself the next time we return.  Amongst our samplings at the table we had: 1) the aforementioned Cinnamon Toast Crunch chicken and waffles; 2) the chorizo gravy eggs benedict; and 3) the salami, cheddar, bacon and egg panini. I couldn't taste the Cinnamon Toast Crunch that prominently in my precious shared bite of my dining neighbor's dish, but he was apparently a big fan. I love this concept, however, so I will order it one of these days. My one bite of the chorizo eggs benedict seemed appropriately creamy and I noted some Southwestern spice notes, but I considered it a tad undersalted/underseasoned. My breakfast panini with salami and cheddar was pretty much spot on, though, so I was a happy camper.  A few more notes, however. I'm a big hot sauce fan (especially with eggs) and was disappointed in their selection here when I asked. I was told they only had sriracha and Frank's available. Any restaurant that serves eggs oughta have an appropriate pepper sauce available (since they serve Bloody Marys here amongst the other fancy cocktails, one would hope that have Tabasco behind the bar). Admittedly, I'm so much of a hot sauce snob that I think for eggy dishes, green (jalapeño) Tabasco should be de rigueur.  At any rate, the inventive brunch menu, the ambience, the reasonable price range and the attentive service compel me to give this place five stars. There's alwas some room for improvement, but this is an original, contemporary restaurant/bar concept that I will happily introduce to other friends as I work my way through their other menu items and meal selections. Oh, and cocktails, there's always the cocktails."}
{"text":"Tyler was amazing, took care of us all day. You should try the hummus nachos! Brunch menu is amazing with so many options."}
{"text":"Coming here hung over after new years eve I decided to get the Salut Florentine. Welp, that was a mistake, the egg was small and tasteless and the sliced prosciutto was thinner than paper. It was probably the worst eggs benedict I've ever had. However, the service was great and the orange juice was the best!"}
{"text":"We had wonderful service! There was 14 of us that had never been there and we left full and happy! The good was amazing, great appetizers.We had 8 different kinds of brushetta and the hummus nachos which were so amazing! Great wine list and mixed drinks.the only negative thing I could say is that it was very hot in the restaurant.So much that we complained 3 times to 3 people and they all said the manager was aware that it was uncomfortably hot but would not do anything about it. Never the less we will be back!  I would recommend this to a friend."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on Father's Day, and we had a great experience! We called ahead because we had a large party, and when we got there 20minutes early, they were ready for us. Unlimited mimosas were such a great idea, and their bloody Mary's were on point. The mac and cheese bites appetizer only had four, but they were large and super good, especially with the spicy chipotle dipping sauce they came with. Everyone seemed to love their bacon and chorizo egg Benedict plates (similar to the outrageous hangover fries!) and I loved my Salmon Avocado plate with arugula and potatoes. (A little fancy for the kids, but they enjoyed the chicken and waffles, grilled cheese, and side of scrambled eggs.)"}
{"text":"I am not one quick to judge or complain... but I'm writing this review in hopes that the service here will improve. The food was tasty I have no complaints in that area. We ordered burgers, a chicken pita and pasta. I'd hope the $4 up charge for chicken would be worth but it was a very small portion. Regardless, it all came out great. Compliments to the chef. However our server Tyler is a little inexperienced and needs more training . We had a group of 6. We sat on the patio and weren't greeted for about 15-20 minutes. It didnt seem too busy inside or outside. It took one of us having to go inside to get a waiter.. We decided to check this place out because their restaurant was listed as a buy one get one entrée on our Elite Restaurant App. We ask Tyler to confirm that this was in fact valid and he said \"No it is not\". We explained the restaurant is listed and he said okay I'll check for you. Didn't have the greatest attitude about it and returned with our drinks with no answer. We ask again. (Guess he forgot) He then comes back and confirms that we can use it here he said he just never heard about it before.. Well please explain why you would tell a customer NO, right off the bat if you're unsure.  We were glad we were able to use the offer. We didn't just come to be cheap and just order entrées. We ordered alcoholic beverages and an appetizer. The drinks were good but the margaritas were mostly ice, filled all the way up to the top. The appetizer did not come out before our food, they brought it out with all our entrées. Kind of defeats the purpose.. and at that point we didn't want it anymore. I wish everything was good after that but we had to ask for straws 3 times, waited 30 minutes for a 2nd Margarita, and when we received our bill instead of taking the 2nd entrée off he took off a beverage. Goodness.. We felt bad having to keep correcting this kid but it's imperative to pay attention to details when working with paying customers. I'm very disappointed with our first impression. Like I said the food was great, we all enjoyed our meals, but the poor service really stuck out, and left us dissatisfied."}
{"text":"We went to Salut Kitchen Bar to celebrate my 25th birthday. It was important for me to find a space where my family and friends could hang out comfortably, and Salut exceeded all expectations of the entire afternoon. We called a week in advance to reserve a table for 28 on their patio. I was nervous the wait staff might not be able to split up multiple checks so we confirmed this wouldn't be a problem over the phone. Upon arrival, they had cute little flowers in jars as centerpieces and the 2 waiters assigned to our table were SO great. They were extremely attentive and patient with such a large group.   Also, they have bottomless mimosas. Overall I would absolutely recommend the patio for a large group."}
{"text":"This supposed to be a wine bar, yet they cater to the Bud Light crowd.  A few craft beers and the rest are your typical Bud, Miller Lite, Coors lights...Also, not a single AZ wine on the list.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"This is one of the best dining experiences we have had in Tempe. The menu offers a great variety. Really there is something for everyone. The cocktails are also top notch. The service is prompt and friendly, and the decor is great. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Love our bar tender Lindsay, she was a great server! Come on down as they have great drink specials. They do Monday poker nights which looks fun!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the malbec burger which was so good I almost wanted another. We then finished off the meal with the tableside smores which made me extremely happy. Tyler was a doll and very pleasant.  I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times  but I always forget to check in but today I'm going to finally write the review this place deserves! I love Salut! I love the drinks, the food, the atmosphere and the staff! Me and my dog probably have a couple of photos on the board! Sometimes the music does tend to be loud but with a polite request it can be fixed! It's best for brunch. I love the bruschetta and the bottomless mimosas. I always bring my friends who are visiting from other states and I've never had anyone complain. There decor is recycled stuff and it adds a different charm to the place. Another thing that I love is that this place is never swarmed with rowdy asu students like other brunch places on Mill. I will definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was a little excited to try this place when I saw it for the first time and had a gift card given to me for it, but in hindsight I should not have been so excited.  The venue is nice and I like the feel of the patio and openness of the layout, but besides that, this place was lacking.  I tried a few of the red wines and some bruschetta, but nothing overwhelmed me with flavor and I actually didn't love the options of ingredients for toppings (I am a fan of Postino's Bruschetta, which may have ruined me).    On top of the food choices and tastes not impressing me, the service was strange to say the least.  It was a weekday night and the place was empty and when a group of us walked in, they asked us if we had a reservation like it was expected even though the entire restaurant was nearly empty.  Our waiter was friendly, but not totally attentive.  I wouldn't slam the place (maybe I went on a bad night), it seems like it is trying, but I just couldn't give it a raving review in good conscience, but it seems to have some upside.  Maybe I will give it another try sometime and hopefully update my review!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the atmosphere-casual but clean. The music in the background was not imposing on conversation. The cucumber mule was deliciously refreshing. The staff was pleasant and efficient. Tasty sampler platter but portions were a bit small and the s'mores were fun. Will definitely return here."}
{"text":"I wish my first time at Salut was as good as I'd hoped. I part of a group of 10 who had a reservation on a Saturday night. Salut was still carrying Restaurant Week options as a few in the party chose that. The restaurant was not busy at all during our dinner, perhaps 5-10 tables total were occupied including ours.  My best guess is since not everyone arrived at the same time, it threw our server for a loop. She never introduced herself to us (I think her name was Hannah?), skipped some of the party who wanted to order drinks and mixed up some of our dinner plates. The dinner plates were not known to be mixed until the girl next to me was a few bites in to her salmon and told that \"the plate wasn't meant for you\". It was better than the other salmon option she'd ordered anyway, thankfully they didn't up-charge for our server's error. My pasta dish was superb despite a little extra lemon zest in the sauce. Beers are well-priced. Those who ordered RW never received their dessert because we waited forever for our checks and didn't want to risk getting another salty glare from our server (following the plate mixup). Overall, it just seemed like a big uncomfortable hot mess, surprising since the place wasn't that busy! Not sure if I'd return, the entire dinner was just MEH."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I never knew it was so close to my house! My band and I went there last night and everyone was pleased. We all loved the recycled mentality of the decor and vision of the owners.  I had the Brie-Hive sandwich on sourdough with the Salut fries (I could live off of those fries, they were so good!) And then we got the s'mores. We shall be back!"}
{"text":"Went for a mixer event tonight and loved it! I tried 3 appetizers and thought they were all delicious: hummus nachos, quinoa fritters, and the mac and cheese balls.   The owners and staff were all extremely nice and accommodating! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Their food tasted so good and unique. We had the hummus stuffed avocado and it was one of the best dishes we've had in while because of the distinct flavors. Gabby was our wonderful server who knew everything about the menu and answered all of our questions. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Salut has the best, most unique menu! Love the environment and people! Great location!"}
{"text":"Salut Rocks they have 1 dollar bottle of wine for happy hour! I had the Italian Panini it was so good and we also shared the Smores dessert OMG so wonderful! I would eat here again in a heart beat.  The atmosphere is comfortable and crowd is a friendly one.  Tempe has a little gem with this place!"}
{"text":"They have some of the best vegetarian options I've come across. They fantasy humans dishes and would recommend to anyone to try their combination starter  The only reason I gave it a 4 was because the wait was ridiculous.  It took over an hour to get our food and we kept getting updates every 5 minutes that \"your food will be here shortly\"."}
{"text":"Great place to go in town. Get the s'mores you get to roast them in from of you which is pretty cool!"}
{"text":"On a whim, my friends and I bought a Groupon for here for 4 people, and we went to celebrate my birthday.  We got there in time for happy hour and enjoyed some great drink specials and shared the chef's plate (really delicious!)   Our service was fantastic!  It was quite warm in the restaurant, but in all fairness it was 113 outside, and the restaurant has all windows with western exposure.  A manager quickly found a fan and pointed it in our direction, which helped immensely.  The selection of craft cocktails is fabulous, I tried the Lavender Lemon Fizz... wow, so good!  For dinner, I enjoyed the pistachio crusted salmon with orzo.  Again, it was delicious.   Everything was really great!  I can't wait to go back and make this our go-to spot to meet up with the girls!  My only tiny complaint is that the booths are really crammed in the space and not the most comfortable place to sit, especially when it's warm.  I think next time we go back, we'll request a table for sure!"}
{"text":"The food was good and a manager recommended an excellent wine. However, the service left something to be desired. We had ordered a starter and shared it with our friends. Then the server came back to take our order and when our friends ordered another starter to share, he took the order and left without taking our order for entrees. By the time we could get his attention and place an order for our entrees, enough time had passed that our friends' food came out long before ours did. And after it did, the server was pretty much AWOL. We had to find the water pitcher to refill our glasses ourselves. We are from out of town, but our friends are locals and we all agreed that we don't need to go back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was great, Riley was a fantastic server. However, multiple items on the menu that I had asked for were out and it would have been nice to receive some sort of deal for that, especially since the drink I wanted was much cheaper than the one I had to get. But overall, loved the ambience and the fact that it's dog friendly!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Bottomless mimosas!!  Need I say more.I went on a Sunday and they had live music."}
{"text":"This is a great place to bring a date, have a drink or just a good time with friends. The food and drinks are great. Had a Mango Texas Mule with a burger. Burgers with fries are super yummy. The service was great and he checked on us every few minutes to make sure we got everything we needed."}
{"text":"Really really good!  Fresh food, relaxed and modern atmosphere, cool employees, amazing ingredients and flavors.  The prices are reasonable as well.  Can't really knock this place for anything. Good appetizers and amazing entrees. We had the Hummus Nachos and Chicken Pita. Add bacon!  Delicious!"}
{"text":"I read about this restaurant opening in the East Valley Tribune when it popped up on my Google News feed about  new restaurant opening in Tempe.  Coming from Phoenix where there's no lack of awesome places to go, I was very eager to try this new place close by to where we live now.  We finally had a chance to try it and I was not disappointed.  The happy hour menu lasts till 7 so it actually gives you a chance to get home, get refreshed and head out.  The draft wine was really good;  I had the Pinot Grigio and the boyfriend had the Malbec.  Both very smooth.  The server, Steve, was very informative and told us about how they're trying some more \"sustainable\" options which was unique.  And the wine list is extensive so I'm looking forward to trying more.  I'm also wanting to have the Cartel Brown Ale.  We had a couple appetizers: the caprese kabobs, two of the bruschetta, the ravioli, the fries and the grilled halloumi cheese.  All were very good and had a unique twist.  (I also used the Yelp check in discount and they were very nice)  The ambiance is nice, and I feel everyone would feel comfortable going.    This is only a few weeks old and am looking forward to it growing and them editing, little things like adding more bruschetta flavors, or more lighting outside and misters.  All and all, I know my go to place now for a good glass of wine and awesome service.  And it's a dog friendly patio"}
{"text":"Had a couple craft cocktails, the hummus nachos, turkey burger & chicken panini...all tasty! Great service & love the tv's for watching games!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but the food prices were a little high for what you get. Good deal on wine during happy hour: buy one bottle get another bottle for $1. I was in a large party for a birthday and service was prompt she was kind enough to grab some candles for the birthday girl. We ordered appetizers and my salad which I ordered as an entree was very tasty. I ordered the s'mores for dessert as well. It looked neat at first but the heat was very overwhelming for the table. I would try this place again."}
{"text":"This place sucks. No idea how the stats match the quality. This is a 2 Star place. Slow slow service while nobody is here on a Saturday evening. Drinks are fine but the food was awful. Had the brie sandwich which had no Brie. Also had the diablo burger that was cooked well done when asked for medium. Bland and crispy burger. Would not come back. Might be nice for college kids hence the 4 star rating. This is literally one of the worst places I've been for the price."}
{"text":"Another place in Tempe/Phx that aims to have creative dishes in small portions to make them affordable.  Eh, its ok.    Just wanted to try this place out before diving in for a full experience.  Had an array of bruschetta's, drinks, & appetizers.  The prosciutto melon was a let down since they really skimp on the ham.    After that was an array of bruschetta (apple, sriracha, pesto).  Not bad, not great, nothing to really make this place memorable.    Drinks were decent, we had a manhattan & a lavender fizz (upgraded from bombay ti hendricks).  Again, decent, no complaints, no heaps of praise either..."}
{"text":"Not really sure what all the hype surrounding this place was about. We went for apps and drinks... our waiter came by and asked what he could get started for us, and then walked away for almost ten minutes... that was weird. He was a nice kid, but a little off with his serving skills. We ordered the friend macaroni balls, the presentation was nice but they were super bland. My first glass of Prosecco was just about luke warm, that was disappointing. Then we moved on to the truffle fries... they were very tasty and presented nicely. We tried four different bruschetta and were underwhelmed by them all. The atmosphere on the patio is great and it's a nice place but overall wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was for an event. The event was all day, the service was amazing! I have never felt so fabulous. Did I mention the food was AMAZING?????!!!!!! Try the truffle fries and any mule. The outside patio is gorgeous, but please take an antihistamine because the pollen can cover the table. So all my allergies heads beware. Can't wait to come every month for my event #blackgirlsbrunchphx  Not to mention 1/2 off all wine during happy hour! What a steal! Bring a friend and have an blast!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I wish there was one closer to where I live currently, but when I get my chance I come here. My boyfriend is GF and this was a great place to come and enjoy good food, good atmosphere. Prices are amazing during HH :)"}
{"text":"came here for a belated bday brunch. We both had the chicken and waffles and I loved the waffle very big and crispy. Now the chicken was tasty but for some reason  it was missing seasoning and because it is fried chicken it was unexpectedly bland. I also had a Bloody Mary too and very weak and I'm not a big drinker either but I'm giving 4 stars because I still liked the restaurant and I'm sure they have other yummy stuff on the menu that I want to try and they have potential bc of location and staff."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cool.  Food good if you can get it.    Cannot handle a large group.  Go here if you have time to wait."}
{"text":"My friend and i sat on the patio, it was so nice outside. :) cute beach vibe with the bench chairs and all. Love all the lightings too.   The hummus nacho was delicious. Its a musttt. :)) My friend got the bruschetta pesto. That was tasty, kind over kill with the tomatoes,  but it was good.  Drinks. Pheewwww Grapefruit basil martini was sooooo friendly. One was enough for me. Haha :) The peach fuzz.. ehhh.. all I taste was juice. So negative on that.  Haha.  I want to go back and try their entrees :)"}
{"text":"So I'll start by saying the food here is very good, I enjoyed it very much and will probably eat here again. The reason for the los review is more about how annoying my two visits were. So I'm going to assume this may be some offshoot of a place like Olive Garden or chilis. Because for one they have some of the same nonalcoholic drinks as Olive Garden. (Strawberry passionfruit lemonade) ect. Or at least the look and sound the same. And when you go it the attitude is very corporate. The berate you with questions, and try to push a bunch of signup promotions ect. Even after I loathed from the wifi I had to use my email and now receive spam from them. Now at least for me I don't like siting at a place and being asked 3 times in 5 min how I'm doing and trying to proceed with fake  conversation. The reason I go to small places is because of quality and because they treat you like a person. Not like when you walk in to a car dealership. But again this is probably an offshoot of a corporate place facading as a small craft business"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food.  Habenero Bolgenese and Brie sandwich are fantastic.  Truffle fries are good.  Food takes a while and it is a bit pricey.  Overall, it's a great place and we will be back."}
{"text":"I would have given 4 stars, because the bruschetta board that my friend and I shared as a late-evening supper was really quite good, but the staffing was a mess!  When we arrived there was no one at the host stand outside the front door, but when I popped my head in a server seated us on the near-empty patio at our request.  My friend went to use the restroom, and  the server asked if I'd like to start with waters, and even if we wanted lemon or cucumber in it.  But then the trouble started.  He came back with one water for me.  After my friend had been back at the table for a while and we'd decided what to order, a woman who appeared to be the manager stopped by and had the idea that we'd ordered drinks that were on the way.  I explained that we needed another water, and that we were ready to order the bruschetta board.  She said she'd put it in for us, and went on her way.  After quite a while a different server came up and introduced himself and said he'd be helping us.  We said that we'd ordered already and he said that he knew about the bruschetta and just wanted to know if we needed more drinks or anything else.  So we again said that we needed another water, and he asked if my friend wanted lemon, and she indicated that she did.  He shortly plopped down a glass of ice water with no lemon (or straw, as mine had).    In the meantime two other parties had been seated on the patio and had received their drinks.  After the second water was delivered we sat for quite a while and watched those parties receive their food.  We did receive one reassurance that our order would be out soon, but it was long enough later when our server reappeared that he sent someone else to check on it.  I think it took 45-50 minutes from when we sat down to when we received our food.    At first I thought that since we're at the start of a new academic year there was a lot of new staff.   But now I wonder if there were so many staff on duty that we got lost in the shuffle (I believe I saw all of the servers (4 or 5) come out to the patio at least twice, and there were only 4 tables with patrons.  Anyhow, after reading all of the reviews here, I'm inclined to give them another chance, because the bruschetta offerings were very delicious."}
{"text":"From the music to the food to the trendy (but non-pretentious) atmosphere, there isn't a place I would recommend more highly. What was a minor inconvenience of having to move seats (a large party came in and needed our table) led to the GM David offering free dessert (Make Your Own S'mores) to my friend and I - an unnecessary but generous and professional gesture. Our server Chief was awesome as well - Salut is the perfect spot for a date, a family brunch outing, or for an awesome meal/drink out with friends. Highly, highly recommend - there is no way you'll be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service was great, awesome atmosphere outside. Food was pretty decent. And bottomless mimosas are always good too. Would go again"}
{"text":"Came in the other day looking to try something new. Our server was great (I believe his name was Zach) and the food was delicious. The place was cool too!"}
{"text":"Not happy was really craving this brunch menu and the gentleman at the door said that we couldn't be served good due to the fact he didn't have an hostess to help serve food! I don't know if I will be a back"}
{"text":"Food was great, but the service was atrocious.  Argumentative server that didn't follow any requests."}
{"text":"Dog friendly!!!! That would be enough for a five star rating. The patio is cozy, dog friendly, with tvs to watch the game. There is always some sort of drink specials as well. Simon was my server and he was very friendly and attentive, also brought my pup bacon. The food is very good, very similar to Postino's. Overall, enjoyable place to hangout."}
{"text":"Came here for Easter brunch. It was super yummy, service was good, and a really nice atmosphere. We will be back. We got the breakfast burger and chorizo Benedict.  Everything was great."}
{"text":"So yummy! Everything is good here. Great service and the menu is totally to die for. Cute hostesses too! Awesome patio and really cool vibe inside :)"}
{"text":"Cool music. Atmosphere is causal and laid back. Almost like being in a friends garage.   Great selection of mules. Interesting beers on tap. Tapas menus with salads sandwiches and beef and burgers.   Wild mushroom tapas add shrimp was intensely flavored and perfectly portioned for one. I really like this dish.   They do need to sort out their tap issues. Half weren't working and mass confusion ensued the night i was there.   Worth a try. The also seem to be dog friendly as well. They run booze specials every day."}
{"text":"Went here for diner with my girlfriend the other night. We really liked it, she had a hummus wrap and I had a brie-hive sandwich. The food was good and they have these fries called \"salut style\" which comes with some sort of garlic sauce and crumbled cheese, sounds weird but tastes pretty good. also the food has a wine pairing suggestion next to it on the menu which is cool"}
{"text":"Okay, let me start by saying that we absolutely loved the atmosphere of this place. When we arrived my husband was ecstatic because he thought we had found our new spot. We also loved the staff, great people. However, we were super disappointed after that. My sister ordered the $18 bottomless mimosa, pricey, but she was willing to pay it for a great bottomless mimosa. Unfortunately, it was heavy on the orange juice, light on the champagne, and worst of all, it was warm. No bueno. She switched to the bacon Bloody Mary and was also quite disappointed with it. So was my hubby. Moving on to the food, it was good. But for the price we were paying we wanted great. They have no children's menu so I ended up ordering my 6 year old son a $13 meal which really irks me. But thankfully my husband enjoyed my son's meal more than his own. My sister had an ok benedict with the worst potatoes ever served alongside a meal. They were cold and hard tiny pieces of potato with no seasoning or love in them at all. I had the chicken pita which was good, but I could have gone to my neighborhood pita spot and had an ahhhmazing chicken pita for half the price. So that was our experience. Terrible over priced bar and so-so food WITH great people and potential."}
{"text":"Had such a great time at our holiday party! The servers were very attentive, food was fantastic, and I loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great dog friendly patio, decent food and price. Service was a little slow but the patio was nice enough that I didn't mind."}
{"text":"Love that I stumbled upon this restaurant with a friend. The service was excellent and the food was out of bounds for a brunch menu. I have back here several times with other friends and they enjoy the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went to Salut because we had never been there before and it was close to the venue where we had tickets for a 7:30 show.  We arrived at the restaurant at 6:15 and immediately placed our orders.  We were a group of 6 so we were enjoying our conversations and not paying attention to the time.  Well, when we did look at the time, it was 7:10 and we had not yet received our food!  Imagine, sitting 50 minutes and having great conversation and not noticing that your food had not yet arrived.  The atmosphere is conducive to socializing.  Needless to say, we had to demand our food ASAP or walk out without dinner.  Our food arrived within seconds of notifying the staff of our urgent need (was it sitting under a warming lamp all that time?   Hmmmm).  We all had to stuff the food into our mouths and rush out so we could make our 7:30 reservations.  I hope the food was worth the time, but I really couldn't say since I didn't have time to taste it.  We may give Salut another try when we don't have a time constraint but no promises."}
{"text":"Food was good, but service was questionable.  I ordered late and had to wait because the online menu needs to be updated.  Making my choice was a little frustrating because I didn't know what to order because of the changes to my order.  The kitchen closes at 10:30pm, but they were nice enough to complete my order after hours.  The dressing that came with the salmon salad was amazing, but it was not enough.  I will try them again, just earlier in the evening."}
{"text":"Ok, I have given Salut another try (and another....and another....) and they definitely have come up in my opinion. They have a nice happy hour, 2$ off all specialty cocktails and apps.... the cocktails are fairly tasty, especially the mules. The hummus nachos are fabulously tasty (and they give them away like water...sign up for email club, get free hummus nachos, free hummus nacho coups at many events.....it's awesome!). I really want to try their dinner items, which look fantastic! Why still 3 stars? The service. Without fail, I end up ordering one drink and waiting....and waiting.... and waiting.... and end up getting my tab and going elsewhere because it takes forever to get a second drink. I usually sit at the bar and this has happened with 3 different bartenders...a bit odd. Regardless, I'll be back for HH."}
{"text":"Reservations were made through Open Table on Friday for brunch on Mother's Day, Sunday. I tried updating my reservation on Saturday, but it said the restaurant wasn't taking reservations for the day. It didn't even say there was no availability for the time. I was a little worried that my reservation would not stand, but the host was able to seat me right away. He even thanked me for making a reservation so I'm still a little confused about their reservation process.   Tip: Make reservations for holidays a few days in advance in case they decide to stop taking them (at least through Open Table). Yelp coupon: As of 5/14/17, the house wines are the Vista Point (and I believe Rock Brook). According to Kaylan, the house wines change so double check with your server.  Kaylan our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about the popular menu items such as the Skillet. She was so sweet and came by frequently to make sure we didn't need anything else.   Hummus Nachos - You can taste that the hummus is homemade with its consistency and unique taste. Very delicious! My only comment would be that I couldn't taste the very few pomegranate seeds. If you're trying to decide an appetizer, you can't go wrong with this!  Salmon Avocado (gluten-free) - The dish came with PLENTY of salmon pieces. For me, the salmon tasted and felt almost tuna-like because it was dry. I just re-read the description for this meal and noticed it was supposed to be honey-glazed... I wish the avocado was a bit more ripe because I couldn't really taste it. The egg was perfectly prepared though! However, the main ingredients didn't provide the flavor the dish needed.  There is a nice selection of other brunch entrees that I would want to come back and try."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends for happy hour this past weekend. Loved it!!!  They have happy hour 3-6:30pm everyday and also certain drink specials that run everyday. For drinks I got a Mojito. It was ok. I've been drinking all day so I wanted something on the lighter side. For food we got the sampler which comes with the hummus nachos, caprese salad, salut fries, and prosciutto wrapped melon. The hummus nachos were amazinggggg!!! I wanted to keep getting more! There were three of us so it didn't fill us enough so we ended up also ordering the Paquillo Ravioli with shrimp. I really loved the sauce that they had on this. I thought that the entree was a bit small, especially for $17.   The service was really great here. The place has only been open for about a year but everyone was really friendly and accommodating. When we ordered the pasta they forgot the shrimp so they brought it out on the side after and took it off our bill. At the end, they forgot to bring us our check so my friend went to the bar to ask them for it. The manager came over and apologized and ended up giving us free shots to make up for it! Wow. I don't know about you guys but I don't know a restaurant that would give you free shots for that. I eventually want to come back to try their brunch and they also have bottomless mimosas on Sunday! I'll definitely be back for happy hour or brunch soon. Not to mention the workers are not bad to look at.FYI ladies.. =P"}
{"text":"Cute place hidden away in a strip mall on University. Love the look and feel, and the ambiance is nice but casual - great patio as well. Service was awesome - they leave green glass bottles filled with cucumber water at your table. Everyone we interacted with was helpful, accommodating and super friendly. Amazing happy hour deals on food and drinks - healthy pours on the wine were appreciated as well. They serve terrific Moscow mules in copper mugs also. Acoustic entertainment was phenomenal, not overbearing or loud and really nice to listen too. Hummus nachos, quinoa fritters, salut burger and stuffed avocado were all tasty. Too much good stuff to try for just one visit. A return trip is needed for sure!"}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles in town !!!!  Way better than lolo's ! The service was phenomenal. I will be back to try some other dishes . So much to choice from !!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Grilled chicken panini is amazing! I also love the bruschetta choices! Can't wait to go back and try the hummus nachos! Their wine specials and happy hour are great for a relaxing date night or wine tasting with the girls. Definitely recommend this place and plan on becoming a regular!"}
{"text":"This place has a positive vibe and good ambiance....would be a good place to bring a date. All of the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. Shoutout to Nicole, our server, who was very friendly and attentive. Also, kudos to the general manager, Will Brazil, who aside from having one of the most bada$$ names...also provided excellent service and great hospitality.  Recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Took my wife here for date night. One word........  AWESOME!!!!!  Great vibe in the place. Everyone seemed genuine in their efforts at providing excellent service (mission accomplished by the way).  The hummus nachos are awesome and the salmon my wife ordered was so good I ended up having to fight her for it. Tried a few of their specialty drinks and I must say that the lemon fizz drink thing is also AWESOME. I saw them installing TV's on the patio, can't wait to come back and have a few beers out there."}
{"text":"I will keep this short and sweet. We had amazing service, really tasty drinks and food and I liked the vibe of this place. We will definitely be back! We came for brunch and plan to try dinner next."}
{"text":"So many great things going on at Salut! My only qualm was that it took me FOREVER to get there due to construction, but obviously that's temporary and I'll be back when it's over (plus - it was worth sitting in traffic!).   I didn't have an actual meal but I my friend and I had a few items off the happy hour menu. We had Hummus Nachos, Peppy Dew Peppers and the Caprese Kabobs. All of the food was delicious and came out quickly. There's a lot more on the menu I want to try next time!   They have great happy hour drink specials, both of us had wine, it was a nice Malbec. We also sampled the Cab on tap that was yummy. We were hesitant to try wines out of a tap/draft (it makes me think of boxed wine - ew)... but I/we were very pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was and continued on for a second glass.   The restaurant is super cute and word is that you can bring your dogs and sit on the patio so I'll have to bring the fur baby next time. :)   Quite possibly one of my favorite parts of all of it was the service. I think customer service is a lost art but these guys got it spot on. Our server was attentive but not overbearing and offered up suggestions when we needed it. We sat at the end of the bar so we chatted a bit as well and he was very informative about the restaurant itself as well as the wine selection.   Can't wait to go back! Thanks for an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Super cool atmosphere inside and fun patio outside. The menu selection is fantastic, so much hummus and avocado it made me so happy. The hummus nachos are to die for. And all the drinks sound delicious. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Salut is one of my favorite places ever! Delicious food, relaxed atmosphere, great specials and usually good service. When it's cooler the patio is perfect and it's dog friendly. I love this place and I'm always bringing people here"}
{"text":"Great for a weekday night out... The atmosphere are relaxing and Monday's you get a bottle of house wine and smores for $20 after 7. The staff is helpful and very attentive."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  Fantastic food and service!  The wine selection is outstanding!  The prices are reasonable for the quality for food and drink!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I went to Salut Kitchen Bar with my boyfriend since he was in town, and I happened to have found a deal off Groupon for it. We made a reservation for 7pm on a Monday night since we wanted a quieter atmosphere. Upon entering the restaurant we were immediately greeted by a host at the front door who led us to our seats. The server came out to get our orders and was very nice and helpful. He helped me choose my entree. We started out with cocktails which were served in crazy looking glass dishes and tasted awesome! I got the Lavender Lemon Fizz and my boyfriend ordered the Dark & Stormy. For entrees, we ordered the Pistachio Crusted Salmon and Chicken Chasseur. Once we tried our dishes, we were put in our happy places! The salmon was very moist and served on a bed of orzo pasta cooked in wine while the pistachio gave it that added crunchy texture. My boyfriend enjoyed the chicken chasseur as well. I would highly recommend coming back to this place, and the dark/quiet atmosphere is great for a date night on the weekdays!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  The service was excellent (thank you Raven) and the food was delicious.  We really enjoyed the atmosphere, and the s'mores!   Yummy!!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I went to HH with a girlfriend....I will be back!  Great drinks and food.  I ordered a grapefruit and basil infused martini.  It was too sweet and lacked alcohol.  I ordered a pineapple infused martini next and it was much better...ended up ordering a second.  We shared 4 appetizers.  Salut Fries-DELISH.  Hummus Nachos-DELISH.  Quinoa Fritters-DELISH.  Hummus Stuffed Avocado-meh....it needed something else, not sure what, something crunchy...maybe plantain, sweet potato chips, bacon...anything crunchy!  Service was great and manager brought us free sorbet at the end.  I can't wait for the weather to cool down so I can sit on their great patio!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Sat at the bar Sunday AM and the bartender and his barback killed it. Being a bartender and knowing how overwhelming stuff can get when you have a full bar and servers are needing their drinks they did a great job. Fun to watch and awesome product knowledge. The 2 ppl I went with got bottomless mimosas for $18 (and you didn't have to buy and entree like most places) and they were on top of refilling them... Even when they were extremely busy. Definitely will come back for the service alone! Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Driving by and saw the lights. Remarked that place looks nice. Quickly scanned Yelp and saw good reviews so we went in. Discovered an inviting space with a great patio and a good vibe. Like going to a friends backyard for dinner. We were thrilled to find that bottles of wine are half-price on Sunday. Our waiter Tanner was friendly and attentive and made our first experience at Salut wonderful. Had the crushed honey salmon salad and the quinoa bowl and both were delicious. We will definitely come back here next time we are in Tempe."}
{"text":"People were really nice. My husband was supposed to be looking for a brunch spot. But they only serve it Saturday and Sunday. They were accommodating and gave us mimosas anyway to make us feel as though we were at brunch. Nice outdoor atmosphere. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Every time I have been here, the food is fantastic, the service is spot on, and the bottomless mimosas never run dry.  This is a great place for an amazing brunch!"}
{"text":"Great brunch!   Dog friendly non-smoking patio.  Really good service and excellent food.   We had the bacon beer chorizo benedict, really great.   Can't wait to come back for mimosas."}
{"text":"Came to Salut with two girlfriends for brunch.  We ordered a few dishes to share.  The quinoa pancakes were interesting.  I'm not a fan of quinoa typically, but I enjoyed these pancakes.  They were fluffy yet filling.  The farmhouse omelette was typical, what'd you want and expect in an omelette.  The potatoes served on the side were not my favorite.  The potato was cut up into suuuper tiny chunks that was difficult to eat.  I would have preferred bigger pieces.  The chicken and waffles was good also.  I loved the waffle!  I don't know if chicken + waffle is my favorite pairing though.  Definitely a large portion and extremely filling.  We came at around 10:15 and the patio was pretty empty.  However, when we were leaving around 11:30 it was filled up quite a bit."}
{"text":"I'm not a five star junkie but this place is my favorite place to get brunch hands down! I have been here a couple times now and both dishes I have had have been wonderful! The beer chorizo gravy they put on the hangover fries and biskuts and gravy is a amazing spin on a southern classic. The service was awesome. My server was up beat and engaging. He made my genuinely laugh. I will be coming back any Sunday I don't have to work. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time and had a great experience! Tried the Veggie Merlot burger and Veggie panini and both were very good, but would definitely recommend the panini!"}
{"text":"Great service, dog friendly patio and good food! Perfect spot for drinks and casual dining."}
{"text":"Such an amazing lunch!  Great company, delicious food, a fun waitress with a spot of green hair, and a deliciously smooth mule --- what more could a girl possibly want?  As soon as we walked in, we were seated by the charismatic and ever-patient Keary.  This girl is amazebeans!  She was sass and class and had great recommendations for food and booze.  Since everybody's favorite ginger couldn't make it, I love you Melodie C., I got myself an Oh Honey Mule [as per Keary's suggestion] in a shiny copper mug/  After that, it was a whirlwind of laughter, cheer, and a lot of foodie pictures being taken.  Those Hummus Nachos though... oh man!  The deliciously crisp pita with a soft chewy middle with a generous scoop of hummus, a splash of balsamic sauce, and topped with red onions, pomegranate seeds, and feta was a delicious bite!  I could just order two of those platters myself and eat it as a meal.  But hey, we're sensible adults so we're going to have a sensible lunch!  I had The Brie Hive and that sandwich was keeping my tastebuds happy.  The Brie Hive was salty-sweet goodness with prosciutto ham, brie [duh], granny smith apple slices, arugula, garlic aioli, and honey butter in between two grilled pieces of sourdough.  Eating that in between bites of the Salut Fries where the citrus vinaigrette helped cut through the occasional bites of too much saltiness from the ham or too much honey butter richness made for a perfectly balanced meal.  It was a rich sandwich though so I had to box it for later.  It strikes me as something that will be just as amazing right out of the fridge.  Overall I had an extremely satisfying lunch where we were introduced to the assistant manager Nicholas and one of the owners David.  This place really has it all:  Excellent service [thanks again, Keary!], higher-ups that really care about their customers, delicious food, and a great ambiance and vibe.  It's all dark wood, metal accents, and sleek lines. Will definitely be back [especially with the coupon cards for free Hummus Nachos]!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food, but best of all... Service! Thank you Darin for the best post audition celebratory meal! You're awesome!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are in town for the pro bowl and needed our Sunday brunch fix. So I went to my handy groupon and did a quick search. I stumbled upon a Groupon for SaluT. As we arrived the awesome smell of the food let us know we had made a great choice. The ambiance was nice. They had a live cover band that played their own rendition of today top hits. The service was slow but it was expected because they were swamped. Our waitress apologized several time for the longer than normal wait. Several other staff members stopped as asked us if we needed anything. The food was great. I had the biscuits and gravy, my husband had the cowboy omelet. The mimosa were also as well. If we lived here this would surely be a regular hangout for us"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable of the menu. Ambiance was perfect! Lighting and music were on point! And the food was phenomenal. I ordered the crushed honey salmon salad as well as a bruschetta board. The food presentation was not only beautiful, but the dishes they were served in were very eye-catching and unique! I was extremely impressed, as opposed to just satisfied, and will definitely be returning and referring Salut!"}
{"text":"The girls dropped in for a late dinner after massages... Everything was wonderful.. The atmosphere is fun, love the wine bottle mirror in the ladies room and the wine bottle lights in the hallway... Could not have had a better evening for patio dining and their patio is great. And best part is that they are dog friendly.. I did not have mine but enjoyed the babies that were there.. Service was top notch...  Now the the food... I had the chicken kabobs... Delish cooked perfectly... the chicken was still moist and the veggies were perfectly charred and the hummas was the best I have ever had...  my friends split the chicken pita and strawberry fields salad and raved about both.  we had friendly conversation with the lovely couple and 4 legged baby at the  table next to us and then we were surprised with tabletop s'mores courtesy of the same couple. Upon leaving found out he was the owner.. Thank you again...  We thoroughly enjoyed everything we had and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"This place is great! Awesome decor! Great lineup of draft beer and wine. A menu that is exotic yet delicious. Great location in Tempe!"}
{"text":"We had Salut on our 'to do' list since watching it on Check Please, and we were able to check it off the list last night. We came straight from the airport after picking up my two aunts who are visiting for the week, there were four adults and our two kids (ages 5 and 3). I had made a reservation, but it wasn't super busy so we probably didn't need one, at least not last night (a Friday). We sat out on the beautiful patio and were served by Tyler who was just wonderful, and really hit it off with my 5 year old in particular, as he listened intently to her never ending conversation. He also busted out a few good one liners throughout our time and he was just incredibly friendly and helpful. The general manager also paid us a few visits and chatted up with everyone, paying extra attention to our kids and striking up conversation. It is just a really nice and friendly, laid back atmosphere (but not laid back service!). As for the food, the mules were phenomenal and a nice spin from a traditional Moscow Mule (between us we had 3 different ones) and the food was perfect. We ordered several apps/tapas and bruschetta. My very picky, Macaroni and cheese only, daughter went through two rounds of the mushroom ravioli, and my other daughter favored the pesto bruschetta and macaroni and cheese bites (also one of my favorites). If we had more room we would have ordered more hummus nachos for sure, but we were full between the food, drinks and dessert (self toasted s'mores and dreamsicle cheesecake - yum!). We will be back on a Tuesday for the $20 deal for hummus nachos and a flight - I really want more of those 'nachos'!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch today and was totally impressed! I walked in and the bartender greeted me, told me to sit wherever I want and he'd be right behind me. I chose a seat outside on the patio which was really cute, a little dirty and tables were bowed, probably because of the weather but otherwise,  I thought it was decorated nice and is dog friendly as well. There's a sign up that says \"bottomless mimosas\" on Sunday from 930-2. Nice! I ordered an iced-t (hibiscus) and a hummus platter while I waited. Another man came by and brought me water and asked if I'd been taken care of, (love that) and I told him I had. Our server was Nathan and he was awesome! We never needed anything and everything was fantastic. We shared the golden beet salad and the brie hive sandwich and they were both delicious. The sandwich was on toasted bread with arugula, brie, apples and prosciutto and came with their specialty fries in some kind of sauce but remained crispy. The salad had almonds,raisins, beets and an arugula spinach mix. Nathan split them both for us, too. We really enjoyed the service and food and definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The attention to detail is sadly over-looked in this place. We were hoping this would have worked out better but it didn't.  The atmosphere is very nice, wait staff attentive. But the first thing we noticed was the seating wasn't comfortable for my husband who is average height but felt the booths were so narrow he didn't fit comfortable. We then asked about the 1 cent bottomless mimosas but you have to buy 3 full priced (total of $18.00) mimosas before you can start getting the penny ones, when asked if they used fresh squeezed OJ we were told it was from concentrate, yuck! Not worth it at that price. Next we asked if they had any specialty coffees, the waiter said no and he didn't know what kind of coffee they use. And, FYI the coffee was bitter. My husband and I shared the chicken and waffles; the waffle was cool when it was brought out and we were given 2 hard lumps of butter to spread on it. The cinnamon butter would have been a nice touch if it was soft. The waffle didn't taste bad it just didn't have that nice  crispiness on the outside edges.  The fried chicken was just 2 uneventful chicken fingers.  Too many other places to go that do a better job, won't be back."}
{"text":"Please don't order the panini- any of them. We met some friends for brunch this past Sunday and the three girls each got different paninis while the guys got omelets. I got the veggie which was supposed to have egg, spinach, onion, tomato, and a garlic aioli.  It did, but barely. When it arrived, I opened it up on my plate and everybody gasped- there was about a teaspoon sized dollop of egg, 3 spinach sprigs, a couple of pieces of diced tomato and onion. Zero garlic aioli. There was a little more egg on the other half, but the rest of the ingredients were the same level of barely there. I showed our server when he came back and he was mortified and brought me a huge plate of scrambled eggs to add to the sandwich. In the meantime, the other girls had realized the same thing was happening on their paninis so we ended up sharing the extra egg to try and build some kind of substance.  The boys said their omelets were decent, but nothing to rave about. Also, they charge $1.50 extra for a tiny bowl of fruit- seriously, about 3 grapes and a couple pieces of melon. The bill for my husband and I, including a bacon bloody mary and one of their Mules was $47.50...pretty ridiculous considering there couldn't have been more than $3 worth of ingredients on my sandwich.  In the restaurants defense, we saw dishes go past that looked really good. Maybe go for the waffles or another big breakfast dish because those all seemed legit. I don't know why they even have paninis on the menu since they clearly don't want to make any kind of effort with them."}
{"text":"Do NOT eat here if you have a gluten allergy.  I went there for brunch today. It took longer than usual for our waitress to come to us. However, they were fairly busy. I   There were a handful of options which were GF. I decided to go with the Salmon option. I specifically stated to my waitress I needed the GF option. She confirmed our orders and that mine was GF. When the food was delivered, I asked again- this is GF, correct? I was assured the dish was GF. It was absolutely delicious. The mixture of favors was perfect.   However, not long after we paid our bill and left I realized - that was not GF. I have been sick the rest of the day. Not the way I wanted to spend my weekend."}
{"text":"I love this very magical atmosphere creative and delicious my favorite stuffed advocados there all yummy though ! Best place in Tempe to bring date or talk business"}
{"text":"I can't even begin to express how amazing the food is here. I found Salut on Yelp and decided to give it a try, and I am so happy I did. The hummus nachos were insanely good, the quinoa fritters were extremely unique, and the pesto Alfredo was hands down the best pasta I have ever had. My only complaint is that I was too full to get dessert haha. Seriously, Tempe is lacking on restaurants with good quality food and I can't believe it took me this long to find Salut. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here with three of my girlfriends on Sunday for brunch as we've heard many good things. Our server was sweet, and efficient.  Overall: The food was wonderful and they had really good drinks Cons: It's small, and the patio is right off of a major road. I suppose you can trick yourself into imagining it's an ocean wave ebbing and flowing, but it is a little loud.  B-"}
{"text":"Epic happy hour menu 3-7pm, every day. Great environment, food is unique and delicious, staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the drink and wine menu is spectacular (ask their Sommelier for a wine recommendation) and if you need a recharge check the USB ports under the bar!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came to Salut Kitchen and Bar to use a Groupon, but we ended up coming on a Sunday during brunch time.  Even though I had my eyes set on hummus and wine, we had a great brunch option.  My friend got chicken and waffles, but the chicken was crusted with Cinnamon.  It was exceptional from the one piece that I tried.  I usually am not a big fan of chicken and waffles.  I got Eggs Benedict, and it was the best Eggs Benedict that I have ever had.  The key ingredient is some sort of tartiness with lime or lemon that gave a zesty flavor.  I wanted more, and I will have to make a trip back here to use my expiring Groupon."}
{"text":"I have been to Salut two different times.  The first time was for happy hour with a group of girlfriends and the second for mimosas.  Happy hour was great as far as drinks and the munchies.  They have a great outdoor patio that opens up into the dining room AND it's pet friendly - always a plus!  The service was great both times I went.  Absenthe is their \"thing\" however, I did NOT care for it.  But it is an awesome experience to share with friends and it's only $5...deal.  As far as the mimosas...eh.  I've had better.  They were made with some kind of concentrate and it was much more O.J. than it was champagne.  That will make for quite the harsh heart burn...yikes.  Again service was KILLER so I was still pleasantly surprised.  I also had the 'meaty' omelet....it was d'lish!  They do not let your mimosa even begin to get low before they're back filling it up again...although, I attribute that to the fact that they're primarily O.J.  Eh, oh well!  I'll stick to the happy hour ! =)"}
{"text":"My expectations were not quite met with my experience at Salut. I hate rating anything a 2 or 1, but I can't bring myself to give it a 3. I wish I could give it a 2.5! My $13 bruschetta certainly was not bad. The toppings were actually quite delicious, but the bread tasted as though they picked it up from Fry's a few days ago. Pictured here are the fig, apple, wild mushroom, and pesto options, with a couple pieces missing ;). My white wine was served at room temp, which I was not thrilled about, but it was still drinkable. The service was below average, although our server was nice. All in all, I've experienced better. But I'd come back and give it a second shot if a friend suggested it- I just wouldn't do the suggesting."}
{"text":"I remember this place being a Thai restaurant but that was definitely a long time ago. We came here with a group of 10 to celebrate my friend's birthday and when we got there our table was already ready for us. The servers were great and very attentive and also very personable and helpful. We had to split the check 5-6 ways and they were more than accommodating to that. The alcohol was great and we got my friend a handful of shots that were recommended by the server and my friend said they all tasted great. I got the JJ chicken sandwich and I must say that was probably one of the better chicken sandwiches I've had in awhile. The chicken was crispy and juicy, the sauce they put in the sandwich was really tasty and the texture and combination of everything was just really good! I got an order of friends which were really good, crispy, and well seasoned. I tasted the Salut fries that my friend ordered and they were also really good! if you like that vinegary, tarty flavor, you'll definitely like those fries. Service was great and atmosphere was also very welcoming and the restaurant was clean. My friend got a smores plate for her birthday treat which was awesome because it was enough to share with the whole table. The drinks sometimes did take a little longer and they forgot a few of our drinks, but it's ok, it happens. Everything that evening went pretty well except for when it came time to paying. The checks were not split correctly and drinks were on the wrong checks. The server had to take some of the checks back to correct them and when they were brought back to us, they were still wrong. It took a good while for the server to go back to the computer and update the checks and still drinks were missing from the checks. So we paid the checks \"as is\" because we were getting a bit annoyed. Then they later came back with separate checks for the missing drinks that they forgot to put on the initial tabs so that was also pretty annoying. Aside from the paying, everything else was pretty good and I would recommend this place and would want to come back to try their brunch."}
{"text":"This place is great, their specials are awesome. One of the few good wine bars of Tempe. The patio is nice and puppy friendly! Not to mention the food is amazing, I had the Malbec burger w/ the truffle fries and wow was it good. I used to live right next door and frequent the place for the drink specials and not usually to eat, what a mistake I was making! I hope to visit more often and show this place to people."}
{"text":"Thanks so much for a lovely experience. So nice to sit outside under the misters on a warm afternoon. Hummus nachos went well with the delicious and unusual cocktails. The lavender gin fizz was terrific. Our salads were so freshly prepared with spinach, avocado, and a lovely bit of salmon. Great ambience outdoors, and a nice wine list to boot."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome Mimosa deal for brunch, and I love being able to take my george there. The staff is friendly and the food never disappoints, always a great time and same consistency for service. Just wished the seats and tables were more comfy."}
{"text":"This place has some amazing Hummus... but the food, unfortunately, is hit or miss, even when ordering the same meal on different days.  I did come here for brunch once and the chicken and waffles were literally still raw - they did comp that dish and offered a replacement.  Just be careful :)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with co-workers--very nice place to go after work! They have great happy hour specials on cocktails (TRY the lavender cocktail!!) and good appetizers to share with friends. We love the 4-for-$12 bruschetta deal, and the S'Mores is fun for dessert.  They have a good menu of salads, burgers, sandwiches, and tapas-style options. Also check out their specials, one for every day!   We most recently sat on the patio, which was a great atmosphere. You can also sit indoors or at the bar. A friend is coming in this week and I plan to take her there.  Highly recommend this cool new place for intimate time for two, or a small group of friends."}
{"text":"The first time I came here it was AMAZING! Second time not so much. I was in love with the hummus nachos but the second time I had them they weren't as amazing. Went for happy hour and tried all the appetizers and they were all just OK. Little disappointing because I was so excited about this place after coming here last fall."}
{"text":"We went there with a Groupon and were pleasantly surprised at how good the food and drinks were. Definitely will return. Ordered the shriracho burger and lavender lemon fizz. So delicious."}
{"text":"I came here last Friday with friends and a Living Social deal. The deal on the living social website clearly said it included two cocktails, one appetizer and an entree of my choice. When I brought up the deal on my phone, it showed it was only valid for the two drinks and one appetizer, NO entree. While that probably isn't the restaurant's fault, it was pretty annoying but didn't try and prove the error and just decided to enjoy myself. It's also important to note that you can't use a LS deal before 6 or 6:30 (can't remember which now). Hence the reason for the tiny print at the bottom that said 'Reservations Required'. Luckily they kept me hydrated with water while we waited the 20 minutes for my deal to be good. It's a cute spot and initially I was sat outside because the Happy Hour was hoping inside and no tables were available. I could see this patio as a really nice spot to come hang out once the weather cools off and enjoy their happy hour special of buy one bottle of wine, get the next one for $1. Unfortunately I had a big group of smokers join me on the patio and that mixed with the misters was pretty gross. Being a former smoker, I appreciate my clean air! It would be nice if they could go somewhere else beside the patio.  Having said that, the server was friendly, sat us inside after about a 10 minute wait and she had no issues using the LS deal. I ordered the grapefruit martini and the Peach Fuzz Fizz as drinks and both were delicious! For an appetizer I chose the Peppy Dew Peppers. I wasn't sure what I was going to get but a new love of goat cheese prompted me to give them a try. When 4 little peppers were brought out on a wooden board (for $8), I was a bit surprised at the small portions. That was until I had my first bite. They were incredible! I loved them! Definitely crave worthy! Each pepper was two bites, which equals about a $1 a bite. Worth every penny in my opinion! We also shared the Salut Fries, which were pretty good. A nice dipping sauce would have really set them off though. All entrees were pretty good (Roasted Corn Salad with Chicken) and while their salad plates were oddly proportioned and it looked like you didn't get much, the salad filled me up and was really good. The server was great, attentive and friendly the whole night so I came out of there a happy camper that night.  Fast forward to the next Friday and I'd been thinking about those peppers every day! I decided this time to take advantage of the LocalDines deal and head back for more of that pepper heaven and introduce my fiance to the best thing I've eaten in awhile. He agreed they were great! This time we opted for beers (hooray! They have Papago Orange Blossom!!) and shared a Sun Devil sandwich and the Italian Panini. Neither one was really great but I did eat more of the panini than the turkey burger and almost left my whole portion on my plate. The poblano pepper on the burger was super hot and I had to take it off and the turkey was dry. The panini was good, just nothing extraordinary. Our waitress was quite a bit slower this visit and never checked in with us so while it wasn't quite as great as an overall experience as the first time, I still be back for those peppers!"}
{"text":"I honestly have nothing but good things to say about Salut! The drinks were innovative and delicious! The whole place is decorated beautifully and is a nice change of pace from the usual Tempe hangouts! I could see this place becoming a chain someday because it is so marketable! The food was SO GOOD! I swear, I almost want to move back to Arizona just for Salut and their restaurant Oliveo Grill. Amazing, amazing, amazing"}
