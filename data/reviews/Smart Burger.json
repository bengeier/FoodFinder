{"text":"Service was disappointing. Girl at counter had attitude, didn't want to serve us and said it was closed 40 minutes before closing. Although the cook was great and offered to serve us, it did not make up for the rudeness of the front of the house. Burger's  good.  Owner may want to check who s(he)'s hiring."}
{"text":"For me, it's five guys or Smart burger. No other burger place comes close. Five guys is juicier, but smart burger has some delicious burger combo flavours that the basic patty+cheese at five guys can't beat -- no matter how many other free toppings you add to it. My personal fave is the bourbon street burger (Carmalized onions, mushrooms, cheese, BBQ) with a side of onion scoops. If you're going with a friend, do yourself a favour and have one person order onion scoops, and another order fries. The onion scoops are delicious!! The fries are decent -- nothing to write home about -- but you get so few onion scoops you'll be longingly looking at other people's meals with a full container of fries that it's better to get one of each."}
{"text":"Great burgers and even better fries. They have the best fries in downtown Montreal. Everything that they make is fresh and delicious even their salads!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I'm the first to review this on yelp.  This is a top contender for best burger in Montreal.  I've tried uniburger and five guys, but this is my fave.  Go when it's busy and you will see them prepare the ground beef. The meat has flavor and the toppings don't overwhelm or clash with each other (like five guys).  They have 5-6 kinds of burgers,  you can choose to have chicken breast instead of beef. And you can have a second patty for $3 and eat it separately as a steak.  A couple of letdowns and minor gripes   Not a fan of the bread.  When it's quiet, the chicken and fries were barely warm, they should make it fresh instead of letting it sit there.  Aside from that, it's great,  nice decor and good location."}
{"text":"My first time in Montreal and my first time eating here. The chili burger is phenomenal!!! The fries are delicious as well!   Staff was attentive and friendly and patient with me and my English/horrible French  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Le meilleur burger au poulet que j'aie mangé en chaîne rapide. Santé et très goûteux avec des ingrédients frais et de qualité. À essayer!"}
{"text":"This fast food joint is well known among McGill students because there just isn't a lot of good food around the downtown campus.  I've been a frequent customer of Smart Burger ever since my undergraduate years, and saw their prices slowly raise from cheap to not-so-student-friendly.  The food has always been good. The meat used for the burgers is of surprisingly great quality, and the patties are generous, juicy and flavorful. Everything is very fresh.  Their poutines used to be pretty decent too. They would serve those potato churros covered with a lot of gravy and cheese curds. The portions were huuuuuuge. That, topped with a generous serving of chili con carne, was enough to fuel the most intense exam review sessions. One time, I ordered a regular size poutine and was asked (twice!) if I was sure about it. I told her it was ok, I'd ordered it many times before, etc. She then directly questioned my ability to finish the food. It was a bit strange. Anyhow, perhaps due to a change in ownership, they have since switched to regular fries and regular-sized portions.   Still a great place to grab an above-average burger without unnecessary fanciness (e.g. m:brgr)."}
{"text":"To call Smart Burger a 'disappointment' would be the politically correct word to use. So, I guess I'll go with that.  I fully understand that this location is located within the Carrefour Laval foot court and to expect the same results from a culinary experience point of view to a stand alone location would be pretty difficult.... but let's be honest here.... our order of their version of a cheeseburger was a pretty sad presentation.  The unexpectedly thin meat patty was overcooked, the bun didn't feel or taste right and the condiments were on the spare size. Comparing our burger to the stock photo within this gallery was night and day though one shouldn't expect remotely the same type of presentation... but the taste... or lack thereof... was insulting to at least this connoisseur experience of a cheeseburger. Do you truly think you can fool me with this burger after my countless experiences elsewhere? True, you may be food court grub but that's no excuse for what was received. Fix that.  The side order of fries were good and the only reason this review didn't nail the 1 star rating. They were thicker type of cut and crunchy and was the best part of their trio presentation.  Needless to state our experiences here left much to be desired. We should have known better as the line-up here during peak lunch hour in the food court was oddly the shortest of most of the food court line-up. My wife thought she got lucky, didn't feel as much as we left this food court."}
{"text":"Yum. Filling, juicy burgers and fries that will make every McGill skinny girl thick af. Quick bite around McGill, although its been closed for renovation fo a while now. Can't wait for it to reopen though, great if you wanna grab a bite close to campus."}
{"text":"Bland burger doesn't taste like much for $8 Wasn't impressed at all. Should of went to A&W. On top of it got my order wrong. I was the only one waiting and they get it wrong huh?!?"}
{"text":"I am a little disappointed since they raised their prices for great-OK to OK-Pricey. We used to eat here a lot since it is very close to McGill and the quality of the food is great and also was the price. For about 9-10$  you got a great burger+drink +brew fries/chili/yam fries NOW they raised the prices a meal is 12-13$ (about 20-25% more) and for the good side dish like their amazing brew fries you pay an extra 1$ so you pay more for lesser product or much more for the old deal. Why do I still go there? Their Teriyaki Veggie burger is the Superb and the Brew fries with their chili ketchup( you need to ask for it) is a great meal and sometimes tour just in a mood for that. I used to go at least once a week I guess now it will be once every 2 weeks. The make a long story short: Pricey but teal good."}
{"text":"The burgers here are really good, prepared with fresh toppings right in front of you. The prices are also reasonable considering that you wouldn't be saving much by getting the junk that McD or similar are offering.  What I really want to highlight here though, are the fries. Sometimes I come here just to get a serving of the fries.... That's all :-)"}
{"text":"If you are in Montreal search this place out. There isn't another fast burger joint on the planet that freshly grinds their beef on a daily basis. I was blown away by the concept. You can actually see the staff putting the whole beef into the grinder. Great buns which are always an important ingredient and a wide variety of toppings makes this place a winner. Five guys doesn't even come close!"}
