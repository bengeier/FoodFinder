{"text":"Called in to ask if they do delivery and the women just said no and hung up. Pretty rude if you ask me"}
{"text":"I come here for Saturday dinner with the family almost every week. The food is amazing thats why we come back all the time. Their bbq pork slice, bbq ribs, chicken balls & wings, beef and broccoli and more are making my mouth just happy. It helps alot that they added a menu of what the food looks like so you can choice what looks good. The people are very nice (been coming here a long time) since they do know us always asking about everyone. Everytime I have friends I always show them this place and they get hooked on it. So please give it a shot."}
