{"text":"We went there Saturday Dec 26 .we ordered fried calamari. Portion were half what was posted on food gallery.they were horrible Chewy hard like leather.other items were higher in price than other Italian restaurants, portions are smaller as well. Difinetly not a 4stars.may be they are a 2 star not more"}
{"text":"JENN SAYS -  MARCOS SAYS - Pretty good. The only problem is that it can be quite pricey..  JENN'S REVIEW:  MARCOS' REVIEW: I have to confess that I have been there quite a few times, because Jenn loves it here, and it is close to our place. Each visit has been a pretty satisfying experience, I'd say around 4 stars solid each time. The restaurant is very consistent and my only complains are the price (it can be pricey at times, depending how much we order) and sometimes on Fridays or Saturdays there is a line-up (that obviously is not the restaurant's fault, it is just an indicator of how good it is). Also, sometimes it feels like regular customers are acknowledged by the staff and get the best service, and new people or first-timers get not-as-good-service, and I particularly dislike it when it happens.   http://www.farroristorante.com/  The following starters are excellent: Steamed Mussels with White Wine, Tomato Sauce  Steamed Clams with mushrooms Calamari Fritti  Caprese Salad  Marinated Beef Carpaccio with Arugula, Truffle Oil and Parmigiano-Reggiano Slivers  The pizza and the pasta are pretty damned good. The specials are usually excellent.  If you are driving from Toronto, I'd suggest to make reservations, just in case it's one of those busy days."}
{"text":"Excellent kitchen and service and wine choices are always excellent. Best Italian place in Maple."}
{"text":"Food was excellent but bottled water was quite the ripoff and we had to wait for our table for about half an hour PAST our reservation time! Plenty of Italian restaurants in Vaughan, probably won't rush back."}
{"text":"6 of us recently returning from a trip to Tuscany celebrated my birthday  The meal was beautifully presented and our server Shawn was a delight!  Entertaining, helpful, a pure delight.  The chef and Shawn are a killer combination.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Great dining atmosphere, wouldn't hesitate to return. One of my favourite Italian restaurants!"}
{"text":"They have great food..They have delicious entrees, (salmon and  a pasta dish with sun dried tomatoes..I can't remember the name it was a few weeks ago..) Their bread and olive oil /vinegrette was suburb and great salads and appetizers. Fab atmosphere and rustic decor ..super cozy and comfortable."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times and ive always had a very good experience. The food is consistently good and the service is excellent. Our waiter was very personable and made the experience very enjoyable. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting an Italian restaurant around the area in a week. I went with my friend and the restaurant was not difficult to spot at all. They do have ample parking in the back which is perfect and its free.   However, they have two \"entrances\" into the restaurant. Usually you have clients entering into a restaurant from the front. However in this restaurant, you have to enter from the back. There is not a clear sign saying \"entrance\" or \"welcome\", or any indication to let you know that you have to enter from the back. The entrance from the front, is the exact. My friend and I entered from the front, and lo and behold, we had an awkward moment when walking to the back of the restaurant to give our reservation information.   That being aside, it did not take long for the waiter to come to our table and take our orders. FYI we are both vegetarians. We ordered Bruschetta for the appetizer to share, and its 6 pieces which is average in terms of portion for two people to share. I've had my fair share of Bruschetta and this place makes it just right. For the entrees, my friend ordered the Mediterraneo pizza and I ordered the Fettuccine alla Greca pasta. Total wait time to get our entrees was roughly around 30 minutes, which I guess was normal as it was a Friday night, and it was busy inside. However the waiter did come to our table to apologize and said it wouldn't take longer. As soon as he did, it only took 5 minutes and we got our entrees.   My friend said it was worth the wait as he enjoyed his pizza. As for my pasta, the portion size was perfect and the taste was good. However, the only one drawback was that for the first few minutes it was nice and hot. Then, after those few minutes, the pasta became warm, to the point it was almost cold. Rather, it did not retain its heat as per my expectations.   Overall I'd still come back here, but it definitely loses a star for those two things that I mentioned above: 1) No clear signage indicating the entrance is in the back of the restaurant, and 2) The pasta became almost cold after 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Amazing food but a touch on the pricey side.  But well worth the dining experience. Nice decor."}
{"text":"We had a dinner on Sunday eve at Farro. We ordered fried calamari for appetizer, osso bucco and some gelato for desert. Why 2 stars ? Even though the food was  ok ,and the overall ambiance in the restaurant was nice , I was a bit disappointed with the way dishes were served and table was set . Also, the service was a bit ... annoying. I have been asked more then 3 times during 10 mins if my plate can be taken. It looked like they really wanted us to be done with the meal as soon as possible. Main course and appetizers : the way that portions were laid on the plate looked like their chef didn't have enough time and patience to make it more appealing and clean. Example , osso bucco plate had traces of sauce all over the borders of the plate - it kinda killed the overall impression of otherwise tasty dish.  Bottom line - I would expect more work on details and serving for the price this place charges."}
{"text":"Glad that I called ahead to make a reservation. This restaurant is a little gem in the neighbourhood. Very busy since the food and service is great.   Food: Lots of choices on their menu. They provide complimentary bread with a homemade hummus after you order. I ordered a lamb stew which was very good. Tender and flavourful, it made you want more. My husband who is not a big fan of lamb also liked it and wished had ordered one for himself. We finished off with tiramisu for dessert. Homemade and very authentic, it was very enjoyable.   Service: Service was good. I liked how they checked in periodically to see if everything was okay."}
{"text":"This restaurant is well designed and has a nice atmosphere but the food is mediocre, kids meals are awful, the fries are dry and soaked with oil. The kids' pizza was way too salty so no one could eat it. The adults had tasteless tortellini and spaghetti with clams that some of them were bitter. The bill for 2 adults and 2 children was $100 Go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"Have been living in the area for over 10 yrs now and didn't know this restaurant was there  Initial impression was good, place was clean and was about 3/4 full  Our server was great right off the hop and was really kid friendly  For starters we ordered the calamari fritti and they were cooked well, no problems there  The kids had one pasta with butter and one pasta red sauce, me and the wife split the seafood linguine for a starter and she had the salmon and I had the lamb  The pasta was good, wasn't the best I've had  but a little under seasoned, but not bad   The salmon, very bland and some of the vegetables on the plate did not look fresh and even maybe slightly over cooked   The lamb chops were a nice thick cut and the presentation was nice, but if only the lamb was as good as it looked, very gamey strong taste, obviously not Ontario lamb and was very under seasoned    We all split a tiramisu and there were no complaints in the department, it was house made and you could tell it was fresh   Overall because our server was so good I gave the rating a 3, this could have very easily been a 2 to 2 1/2 rating"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the restaurant is beautifully decorated.  Very spacious which makes it excellent for groups.  We had a group of then and it was more than enough space.  The waiters and servers were very polite.   When you walk in you will notice their stone oven.  Obviously I had to try their pizza. Excellent stone baked oven pizzas. I didn't order desert but some of the others ordered tarimasu. I had a taste and it was delicious.  I have to get that next time.  Overall I had a great experience and will definitely go again if I'm up for Italian."}
{"text":"Terrific find! Lovely Italian restaurant. Very pleasing decor and refined but relaxed atmosphere. The food is top notch. Grilled calamari perfectly cooked. Farro Risotto was delicious and the veal pizzaiola was tender and tasty. Great service. Thanks for the prosecco for our 25th anniversary! A delightful evening!"}
{"text":"I nice gem in the heart of Maple . Went with a group of 8 people and the service was excellent and the food came hot. Nobody was disappointed and there were some hard core older Italian men that loved the food.  I would recommend any of the pasta."}
{"text":"I ordered the mushroom risotto. Rice was a lil too hard but it taste amazing.   Customer service is spectacular!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night expecting good service because it wasn't busy but we waited almost 30 mins to get our order taken. Our waitress walked by our table many times but always seemed place higher priority on her other tables. That was a huge annoyance for me and definitely contributes to why I won't return.  The Calamari Fritti is disappointing. It wasn't crispy and to quote my friend, \"the dipping sauce is better than the calamari\". I also had the Penne Salscicce which I liked better than the Calamari but it wasn't very impressive either. The portion was big but I've had better tasting pasta.  In the end, they were way quicker to clear our table and give us the bill than they were to take our order so thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"Food: great Service: OK Price: high Gluten free: yes  We've dropped inn for a few dinners here in the past year. We were always happy with the quality of their food. Always taste good and very fresh. One con is that their portions are not consistent. It is evident in the pictures, especially if looked at carefully and compared side by side; for example  my grilled calamari to others' ..  The service is a hit or miss, depending on how busy they are, if busy you might feel rushed, as they want to sit the next table, and that will pretty much determine the quality of service, weather the staff will be likeable and professional, depends on the night....  We're not huge fans of the interior, although it's clean, and the decor is not bad, except it's way too open concept to our liking, loud voices and lots of background chatter, could use some music.  It's hidden inside a little plaza, and the entrance is from the back of the restaurant, however there is one at the front, and we've seen people enter from that door, only to be ignored and awkwardly left standing in the middle of the dining room.... And You will mostly find regulars here.  ... P.s I really enjoy their gluten free options, but wish they could cater more towards families with children, a little kids option or menu couldn't hurt. ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent food. We visited them when in Canada during thanksgiving. I had risotto. Everybody in the fsmily likdd thor dishes too. Will visit again"}
{"text":"All show no go. Beautiful inside. Unfortunately we had a condescending waiter who spoiled our mood. We are foodies and this was a big disappointment. Veal was spongey,  mussels were smelly and shrimp in pasta was boiled not grilled.  Lacking authenticity.major dissapointment"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now with my kids and each time, their food and service qualities have been notable.  I am on a restricted diet, needing gluten free meal options.  This is a hard ask at an Italian restaurant because the risks of contamination and cross contamination are very high.  Farro does a very good job to limit those risks and I am pleased that so far each of the meals I've had have been without incident and delicious.  Knowledgeable wait staff makes ordering a breeze.  There is an up charge for the gluten free pasta substitution, but, it is also certified organic content, which is my preference anyway.  They also have a GF pizza but have not tried it as that is very difficult for kitchen to manage in prep area and baking in same oven as other pies."}
{"text":"A large group of us came in on a whim hoping the could accommodate us for Saturday night dinner with kids at 515pm. They were able to with the caveat we could give them their table back by 7pm.  So, while we did feel like we were being rushed to order etc, to be fair, they did mention that in the beginning.   The atmosphere was lovely and the service was ok, although they kept asking to take our plates away before we finished eating them (we get they need the table back, but the food should have arrived much sooner then!)  The Good: pizzas were amazing. Crispy, but softer in the middle, thin and light. The kids loved them.  It was 13.50 for a kids pizza, but the size was fair. The grilled calamari was cooked and seasoned to perfection. My husband enjoyed his sausage penne. Again the price was high for pasta,  the portion was big enough for him to take some home for a late night snack.The truffle gnocchi was very tasty and the Fresh bread basket was also a crowd pleaser.   The Not so Great: The muscles in my seafood linguini had sand. I hate that. They didn't soak them in salt water long enough, so while the shrimp and sauce was alright, that really ruined the meal for me and I left most of the muscles on the plate. Waste. My friend had the seafood linguini special (not the tomatoe sauce one) but it was very bland. She also left most of the pasta on her plate.   We finished our meals as promised by 645 which didn't leave much time for dessert...so no reports there.   All in all, nice place. 3.5 stars. Pricey for pasta.  And with so many other well rated Italian places in the area, we'll be giving the others a try before considering coming back."}
{"text":"This is the best gourmet Italian restaurant North of Toronto. We've dinner here couple of times and it was an amazing experience. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Had the Napolitano pizza. - was good!  Prices were expensive which is why I gave 3 stars. Service was slow."}
{"text":"We have had pizza here before which was pretty good but other than that the food is not very good for the price. The bruschetta is plain and simple (basically tomatoes and basil no seasoning or flavour). Tomato sauce tastes like it came from a can. They also brought the wrong food (messed up order) and didn't provide any compensation."}
{"text":"First, I found the staff to be VERY friendly and attentive. Could not have asked for better service. Second, the Apple & Radicchio salad was amazing - a delight. The main dishes were disappointing, though. The Mediterraneo with Eggplant pizza was dry, tasteless crust and not much flavour overall (and I truly eat almost anything). My friend's Mushroom Risotto was flavourful, although she had to add salt and it was VERY mushy. Probably worth a try - I'm sure there are other items that are tasty."}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem. I usually come here for lunch. The restaurant has a modern rustic italian design, I felt very warm and at peace.   Dishes to order: -Fried calamari -Grilled calamari with mango salsa -Scallops (my favourite)   -The mushroom rissto is a must. I liked it that the rice was not as squishy as other italian restaurants. I believe they use wild rice. It was amazing and you won't get sick of it.  - My friend ordered the Gnocchi with basic tomato and boccochini cheese.  The best part was the cheese, definitely doesnt takes cheap. The gnocchi was good but very basic.   Our waiter was amazing, always refilling our waters and topping up our wine. We also ordered dessert, the vanilla creme brulee and tiramisu. I like tiramisu because it isnt made with lady fingers. It was a prefect end to our meal."}
{"text":"So I booked a reservation for 6:30 and the waiter at the front told me no it's booked for 7 when clearly my confirmation e-mail says 6:30 but anyways we got a table. The restaurant is SO cute. I love the Italian vibes. Very classy! The food was also good! I loved the private parking lot too!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant in a pleasant setting. Decent service and okay prices (other than the pop, which they sell my the micro bottle). Had a mushroom risotto and lentil soup, both were very tasty. Humus and bread is a nice table touch. Would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Went here for my anniversary last night, fantastic experience.  Called ahead to let them know it was my anniversary and they had two complimentary glasses of champagne ready.  Waiter was professional.  Had the chef special gnocchi and truffle and it was great and plentiful.  Only disappointment was the topsy turvey cheesecake.  Recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"It was a freezing rain day and we came here for my birthday dinner since it's not too far away.  The owner came to our table and thank us for coming even thought the weather was bad.  The restaurant is very spacious with lots of parking spot at the back.  We ordered seafood pasta and lamb.  The food is cooked to perfection.  We really like the lamb.  The sauce is very tasty.  The taramiu cake is good and original too. Now that we have discovered this little gem, we will come back again next time."}
{"text":"Bit of a loss how to rate this one. Started with our reservation being lost. They did find us a table, but it was freezing cold. Coldest day of the winter and table was near a door that kept opening.  The restaurant is nice inside and the service was excellent. We started with bruschetta and charcuterie which was good, but nothing extraordinary. The chicken parmigiana was lukewarm, but the kid's pasta was fine. The special heart shaped cheese stuffed pasta with rose sauce, shrimp, scallops and spinach was massive and quite delicious but also not hot.  To end the homemade tiramisu was outstanding. I would go back again for it. Bacio chocolates with the bill were a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great Italian food!  Went with co-workers and we all enjoy our meals.  The entire experience was positive from food quality, ambience, to service.  This is my favorite Italian Restaurant in the Toronto suburb area.  There was a large variety of options and not too noisy of a place.  We went during the weeknight, but was still pretty busy."}
{"text":"I took my mother to Farro, which is Italian for 'wheat'. This is a fine restaurant, but I also realized further that Italian food is not one of my favourites.  The restaurant is in the typical suburban plaza, but they have done a fine job of creating an atmosphere, giving it a 'wheat' coloured atmosphere, placing vinegar, olive oil and other jars and bottles on shelves and have an oven behind the counter for that perfect Italian vibe. There was a TV on a shelf, but we were happy that is was off. On certain nights they have a live band, but that was not the case when we went. The restaurant is larger than I had imagined. There were no customers there at 6 PM, but the restaurant was half full an hour later. The restaurant was clean and well-designed, which is important. I was told the hand dryer in the washroom did not work however.  We entered through the back door, were greeted, taken to a nice table and served bread, vinegar, olive oil and hummus... wait, what? Hummus? Isn't that Arabic food? The menu did not feature shawarma, falafel or arayes however. That is a good thing in this case obviously. This is an 'Italian area' supposedly, but there surprisingly are not many Italian restaurants around that I know of, unless Pizza Nova across the street counts. The menu had a number of meat, fish and pasta options. The centrepiece was a  special's menu with items like swordfish on it. There is a small kids' menu section as well, but there were no children destroying the ambiance. The calamari appetizer was clean and delicious,. lemon juice and calamari are truly a match. They conveniently had divided the calamari into two on two plates. The veal Parmigiano for 421 was heavy, but certainly tasty. They had just the right amount of cheese and pepper on it. The quantity was right and I was full. I liked its tenderness. What I found strange again was the bok choy on the side. Was that to match the hummus from earlier?  Farro is a good choice for Italian cuisine in Vaughan. The waitress was nice and not pushy. They are also open all day and do not shut down in the afternoon. Enjoy."}
{"text":"After having a few friends say this place as really good, I was excited to try it. Had 3 people in from our US office that neither me, my boss or my local counterpart had ever met before. Food was decent.  Nothing that blew our socks off but it was good...Pizza looked exceptionally good but I ordered the lamb shank on the recommendation from another table.  However, the waiter was NOT good.  Bald guy likely around 40ish.  He seemed to get the completely wrong read off of our table.  I think he thought we were all best buddies who had just come from the bar or something.  All 6 of us were stone sober and most of us didn't know each other.  Seems like he was trying to be funny and throw jabs at us, but it was kind of awkward.  I'm all for having fun with the waiter but if he's going to make somewhat cocky jokes toward the table, he needs to get a better read on the table first.  While not a 'formal' business dinner...it definitely wasn't the right place or time.   To jokingly embarrass me, he brought my desert out and had our table sing happy birthday to me as a joke.  Again, 3 of the 5 people I was with I had known for 10 minutes prior to walking into the restaurant.  Very very odd.  Cookies in the shape of a women's legs with heels were poking out of my cheese cake.  Again, very awkward.  Surprisingly, I will give this place another chance.  In my opinion, good food should rule everything out and I'm dying for a good pizza place in the Richmond Hill/Woodbridge area.  That is what I'll order next time and we'll see if I get the same guy. Fingers crossed...I will not."}
{"text":"Busy and hoping place. Very good food and a warm ambiance. Nice selection of wines.....reasonably priced for a restaurant.  We had Caesar salads for appetizers......it was superb and the romaine lettuce was crisp and tender.....the way it is meant to be.  Also had a grilled calamari appetizer......comes drizzled in balsamic vinegar and with a small mango chutney.....exquisite taste (although it could have been served warmer......maybe a packed restaurant caused a delay in serving the dish).   Our table of 4 had 4 different dishes and each person said there's was excellent. Pictures are attached. Mine was the angel hair pasta with mixed seafood (class,mussels,shrimp and scallops). Really very nice tasting.   The service was very good and fast.....our waiter was delightful and attentive .  Overall....a very nice evening abs or first try of this restaurant.  Warning!  Make reservations.....the place is packed solid on weekends. Also.....the tables are close to each other so don't expect privacy.....and of course, it trattoria style so the place is noisy.   Last comment.....we'd go back and are planning to do so soon."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant with incredibly friendly and attentive staff. The food is always prepared to perfection and delivered in a timely manner. Prices are average. Atmosphere is lovely :)"}
{"text":"Went for dinner after visiting Canada's Wonderland.  They were able to accommodate us without a reservation.  We ordered the duck, grilled snapper, grilled calamari and they were all very good.  The staff was amazing. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"So disappointing after having several amazing meals at this place. Dinner time and it's emptying service was a shadow of what it used to be. Menu has changed and don't bother asking if they would make an exception to bring back a favourite like Linguine with Clams. Not on the menu and they don't want to talk about it.  Will likely never go again. Not when York Region has so much choice for authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"We had a really great time at this restaurant!   The restaurant is beautiful and they serve up some traditional Italian food that tastes fresh and homemade.   Parking is behind the restaurant and is ample.   The first thing you notice when you enter this restaurant is how warm and inviting it is. It's a large space but it's decorated beautifully and it has a romantic feel to it. The servers welcome you and everyone working there acts as if they are the owner of the restaurant, the service was over the top great.   The food was really good as well, everyone enjoyed their dishes. I got the Gnocchi Gorgonzola which was delicious and rich. The portions are really good for an upscale restaurant, I was expecting 10 pieces of pasta but was pleasantly surprised to have enough for leftovers for lunch the next day. The food arrived piping hot and fresh. The other members of the party got the pollo pasta and the veal parmesan which were both great. They are accommodating to changes as well, if you'd prefer a cream sauce, adding pasta to the veal parmesan, etc...   They have an extensive list of wines and drinks as well as some in-house as well as brought-in desserts. We tried the tiramisu and chocolate centre creme brulee, both of which are made in house and they were delicious.  The price is average for the area and caliber of dining, however the portion sizes are really generous.   The only reason it's not a 5 star as I don't think the menu was exceedingly exciting in my opinion but it's definitely authentic, traditional and tasty, so if you're looking for that, it's great and better than an average Italian restaurant serving similar dishes.   Would definitely come back for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"I was sold on this place as soon as I found out they use a wood-burning oven for pizza. It did not disappoint. I had the Quattro Stagionni and it was very tasty. The staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We had a gift card from our cousin and so we decided to give this place a try! Carmen was really nice to greet us and promptly sat us down. The decor is fantastic and the food was excellent.  We had pizza and pasta and they were both really good! We would definitely go back to try out more dishes in the near future!"}
{"text":"I ate here recently with a party of six. Reservations were easily made, and we were given a lovely table. While this isn't a huge restaurant, it is clear that they take pride in their food, service and setting. Food was top-notch (I had the 16 oz. veal chop, which was melt in your mouth tender and cooked exactly to the temperature I ordered), service was great (our server was attentive and friendly) and the ambiance was very nice (not too much music / noise, nicely decorated). While slightly toward the expensive side (a dinner for four cost us about $400 with appetizers, drinks and tip), the price is well worth it.   Pros: Food (house made pastas were also delicious), service, ambiance  Cons: None"}
{"text":"came across this place with my girlfriend and it is an excellent place for a date. the food is delicious and they have a fairly diverse menu. can't wait to go back and try something different . i had the grilled calamari and tortellini it was great."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect environment for a cute romantic date, a birthday, dinner with family/large group of friends or even privately (well kind of) discuss about ending a relationship! (2 of the above has happened to me, you can take a wild guess). I've also witnessed the waiter singing for the bday girl/boy, a suggestion if you want to make them feel special/embarrassed.    Italian is not my normal go-to so I'm not an expert but there seems to be a quite a few GenX and older Italians who frequent this place. The menu has the traditional Italian meal structure with antipasti, primi, secondi. This place serves large portions in general so you can just order a primi or secondi and be full. Overall good value and taste and would be back for special occasions if it wasn't so far for me.   Came here twice a while ago, so my memory is faint but the dishes that stood out: Risotto con Asparagi e Gamberi - Spelt Grain with Asparagus & Tiger Shrimps ($23.95) - If you like rosotto this is worth a try, very interesting grain texture and unique subtle flavour, some people will dig this but it's a bit bland for my taste. I like the mushroom rosotto below more more.   Linguine Pescatore- Mussels, Clams, Shrimps & Scallops in a Tomato Sauce ($20.95) - Very generous seafood and pasta portion and great flavour  Steamed Mussels with White Wine, Tomato Sauce & a hint of Pernod ($12.95) - Quite a large portion and I love the tomato-based sauce that comes with it  Other Items Ordered: Wood Oven Roasted Rack of Lamb with Zesty Mint & Red Wine Sauce ($32.95) - Not the best I've tried but it was perfectly cooked. Always love a good lamb chop  Risotto ai Funghi- Italian Rice with Wild Mushrooms, Parmigiano & Truffle Essence ($17.95) - Stronger flavour than the spelt rosotto  so I like it more but it's the typical rosotto texture you would expect  Shrimps in Love- sautéed Tiger prawns with white wine, garlic & herbs ($14.95) - I'm sure it was good but it was not really memorable   Smoked Salmon with Marinated Red Onions & Capers ($14.95) - Smoked salmon is just good but wouldn't say it's better than just buying the frozen packet from the grocery store"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Excellent food, service, and overall experience. If i could take off stars for not being closer to my home, I would, but of course that's not fair.   1) Decor and restaurant: the actual restaurant is HUGE. beautifully decorated and it feels very grand; modern, warm, and open. It's spacious, high ceilings that are grounded in huge dark wood beams. It feels like a luxury to dine here. This is definitely a place to celebrate mom's birthday (good for groups), or have a lunch with a girlfriend. The restaurant appears as if it can be separated into two areas, so they may do private events as well. They also have a rather large parking lot (you don't realize how nice it is to not have to look for parking when you go out to eat until there is a dedicated parking lot). 2) Food: the food was absolutely delicious. Real Italian food done well. We had the calamari which was tender and perfectly cooked. The caprese salad (always a winner, wonderfully seasoned and fresh) and the scallops (well balanced with a balsamic glaze, perfectly cooked dish). The gnocchi were like little puffs of heaven in my mouth in a tomato and basil sauce. My eating partner had a fresh pizza that she loved (Calabrese pizza). The waiter suggested a wine pairing which really elevated the meal to the next level for me. Prices were also really reasonable especially for the quality, freshness, portion, and excellent craftsmanship of the food. 3) service: the staff were friendly and SO nice! they were actually what you think a waiter should be: dressed professionally, clean cut, polite, attentive, and very hospitable. My water was always refilled! and he did it without interrupting myself and my friend or jumping in and joining the conversation. Not sure if it's the influence of being in Maple, but it was a quite a refreshing change from the hipster, pretentious, rude service that plagues some downtown Toronto restaurants. The chef, Robert, came out and greeted us as well to make sure everything was satisfactory. He was very friendly and warm, you can tell he takes great pride in offering top notch food and service. As a customer, that's something I really appreciated.   Overall, i'm happy i found this place. It's a blissfully classy restaurant that offers a very good meal and amazing service. I would definitely return with my entire Asian family so we can chow down Italian family style!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend, we had a reservation, our friends called as were eating our appetizers told our waitress that two other people will be joining us, right away she accommodated us. Noticed we were approached by many servers at our table but our server informed us that they work as a team there which was good the service was fabulous. The food was pretty good for apps we ordered calamari and beef carpaccio. When our friends arrived we ordered our mains. My pasta was ok nothing too special kind of bland, but my boyfriends ravioli was fantastic. I know what I'm getting next time I order. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went here for my husbands birthday. We got the salmon, pizza and veal. And they were all outstanding without exception. The waiter was very attentive and he didn't miss a detail. He came over at the exact right moment, and anticipated our needs. I love this place for both the food and the service! I will be back for sur"}
