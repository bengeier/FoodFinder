{"text":"Their chofi (Fried Turkey Tail) with fried yam is bomb! I love the sauce that goes with it too!! Other African Restaurants in the area need to take a lesson out of their book when it comes to garnishing their meat!.  Wet pepper sauce made with freshly ground hot peppers, tomatoes and onions make so much more sense! However, I can only speak on the food. This place turns into a club at night on special occasions never really go for their clubbing events but the food is good.  I look foward to trying the other items on the menu the next time I am in the area!"}
{"text":"This place you will have to come here at least 3 times to fully enjoy everything. If you're looking for Good Fufu and spicy peanut soup, turkey and Fish  this is the right place else the waakye and others could need de improvement"}
{"text":"This place is awesome with their tilapia and their tosfi, the fufu and peanut soup is wicked(just that is too spicy) the customer service wasn't that great but I think is Ghanaian style I recommend this if you want to enjoy good fufu, yam and tilapia. their waakye  and jollof is the only thing I didn't enjoy much I have had it twice and still the same that's the only setback for me"}
{"text":"Very good groundnut soup,  waachye,  rice balls and excellent flavorful baked Fish. Plenty of booths and tables for a nice sit-down meal. Full bar in the dining area.  Combo plates are generally $12 each. Recently,  I found that this restaurant turns into a dance bar after 10pm on weekends. Nice time to take a shot of aperteshie / roots and get wild. Service is decent which is to be expected at most lower-end afro-carribbean joints (im not stereotyping,  it's a cultural thing) . But nonetheless,  ask and you shall receive -  there is a very nice family running the business.  My only suggestion would be to stock more tiger malt,  offer spinach stew and maybe have day or lunch specials where certain traditional dishes are featured."}
{"text":"A came here with a friend (because we wanted to dance) to find an empty restaurant & dance floor (arrived minutes to midnight on a Saturday night). It made us feel slightly awkward so we left soon after. Would return if there were themed/special promotions going on or even if there was a regular DJ or crowd...maybe I should return to try the food"}
