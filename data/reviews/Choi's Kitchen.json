{"text":"We decided to try this new place out because it's much closer to us than our usual spot (The Fry).  We are so glad we did.  Awesome Korean fried chicken.  We had the spicy bbq chicken and it is spicy enough but not to a point that is punishing.  The chicken stays very crunchy with the sauce.  We'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions with coworkers.  Everyone always orders something different and enjoys their dishes.  I've tried the gimbap and spicy rice cakes, they've tried the kimchi ramen, terriyaki, and a couple of other ramens and bowls were always emptied and they raved about their enjoyment.  We are repeat diners because the food is good and the service is friendly and fast enough for us to return to work quickly."}
{"text":"I really like their fried chicken in source! One of the best Korean fried chicken I have ever ate, although other food are a little bit pricy, will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Rice was unavailable for dinner. The green onion filled pa-jun was undercooked and there was WAY too much sweet sauce slathered on the pork cutlet. Went on a recommendation from an Etobicoke resident. Was disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Simple yet delicious. Prices are reasonable for the portions."}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service by the owner and the server. Can't go wrong with their chicken and drink menu. Highly recommended."}
