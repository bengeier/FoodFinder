{"text":"The cannolis are to die for! Cozy and chill environment, perfect for hanging out with your dear friends."}
{"text":"The coffee! My goodness man! This is what espresso should taste like.  Aside from the coffee, they have a very short menu of very delicious food. Just had the Porchetta sandwich and the fried cheese-rice balls.  I hear the cannellonis are worth the trip as well.   I see alcohol as well so I guess you can also have a drink.  Really happy to have found this place."}
{"text":"Brand new little italian cafe opened in the  charming area of Sainte-Dorothee, just 2 minutes away from the \"Super Center\" shopping area next to autoroute 13, on Samson. Ferrari inspired decor owned by the same friendly italian  that owns the hair salon next door.  Great place to have in this area. Good place to watch the World Cup of soccer or just sip a coffee on their front terrace in the sun. Latte was good but not as strong as I wished... Will definitely be back for a double expresso latte. Very happy-go-lucky place."}
{"text":"A dear friend of mine invited me to an Italian bistro located on Samson at Ste-Doroth√©e in Laval. Of course I went to taste their coffee.  The barista was very sweet and engaging. She served us in a short time & suggested a taste of their freshly made canolli which is prepared on site. She was right the canolli tasted fresh & crisp after all it is one of my favorite deserts not to mention the great latte & Capuccino we had. The beans are freshly grinded for every cup. A real Italian experience before my trip to Italy. I totally recommend a stop you will not regret the visit."}
