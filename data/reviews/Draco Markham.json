{"text":"I've been doing this Yelp thing in the GTA for 6 years now, and I've resigned myself to the fact that craft cocktails may never show their face in a big way in the 905. Maybe it's the price, maybe it's the affinity for wine and beer, maybe it's that the understanding of the work cocktail has been confused with items like bellinis and/or blue lagoon passionfruit 17 sugar filled ingredient martinis - I mean they 'are' cocktails but then so is adding Crystal Light to vodka and water - blegh!

I got word that the new Marriott Hotel and Residences in Markham had opened and inside the belly of the beast lay a truly hidden gem just waiting for me to discover it - a classic cocktail bar and Can-Asian inspired restaurant. I was dubious but intrigued, so I sought them out.

If you're pulling their Yelp page up on the app and looking around, no it doesn't have a street facing sign or entrance (at this time), there are two Marriott towers, you'll want to either park under the LEFT tower, or park in one of the lots around Downtown Markham on Enterprise drive. Once you've parked, walk between the buildings (look for the sculpture of the bear) and turn LEFT into the main hotel lobby. Draco is the hotels lobby bar and restaurant but easily takes up 60-70% of the main lobby with a massive lengthwise bar and an abundance of seating.

If you're standing in shock because of how breathtaking this business is, don't worry so was I, but this is your excuse to find a seat (preferably at the bar if you're riding solo) and take it all in. You're in for some surprises.

Fun Fact: Draco, meaning Dragon in latin, is a constellation in the far northern sky and is one of the 88 modern constellations today... oh and if you're not into astronomy, you can simply visit Draco at night where their magnificent ceiling art installation, when adorned with lights, gives off a constellation itself. 

I could wax on about decor and design but to keep it short, it's modern, exquisite and for the younger readers - Bougie A.F. Get what I'm saying?

The real star here is the food and bar. They have an extensive cocktail list with standouts like their Draco Smoked Old Fashioned (which I ordered) a sparkling Sake Mojito, a Rosemary Pineapple Margarita AND a flaming Smores Martini (listed as a dessert cocktail - as it should be) amongst others.

You can also order Barrel Aged Flight boards with various assortments of Tequila, or whiskey.... wait what? Where AM I? Is this my personal heaven?

As mentioned I went with the Smoked Old Fashioned, and wow, what a production. A solid hunk of ice is placed in a heavy metal ice mold and slow pressed into a sphere. While that is happening the bartenders uses a Breville smoking gun to smoke your choice of wood chips into a decanter where it's stored while your cocktail is being made. Hands down, this is the best Old Fashioned in York Region, and in a close competition for best in the 905. True story. This is a must have.

The food menu, is equally impressive. Canadian comfort food staples with a slight nod to the Asian community around which they serve. Not so far as to claim Asian Fusion but a slight palate nod in some of their dishes. Stand outs in my opinion were the Holden County Burger, King Cole Duck Breast, Draco Poke Shrimp Bowl and my order the Lobster Grilled Cheese. 

I wanted some comfort food so a Lobster Grilled cheese with an upgraded side of Duck gravy poutine (gravy is made in-house with duck stock also made in house). If you want pieces of duck confit on your poutine order the King Cole Duck Confit poutine off the shareable portion of their menu.

My meal, while not my best calorie choices, was exceptional. The lobster in the grilled cheese was plentiful and the cheese perfectly married with it inside the egg bread. Then paired with the duck gravy poutine... wow! It was a creamy poutine with one of the richest gravies I've had, only a slight taste of duck so you know it's the real deal.

It's a hotel restaurant/bar so expect a slight premium on prices, but keep in mind you're paying for the prestige and ambiance of this venue as well as the high quality ingredients going into your cocktails and food. Total paid all in for a craft cocktail, lobster and duck infused meal with 20% tip was $50 approximately. You can just as easily come for coffee, dessert and free wifi if you're looking for somewhere to hang during the day.

Between places like Draco, Ruth's Chris (coming Dec 2018), Kiku, Lucullus and Terre Rouge, Downtown Markham is proving that it is steering away from value eats which has been the norm in Markham for ages and aiming for high quality trendy foods that attract a clientele looking to pay for that quality and experience. I personally welcome it and look forward to returning to Draco regularly - it's my new Markham hang.

{"text":"I will start with what I loved about Draco. The relaxed ambience, beautiful decor and open concept is what will bring me back. The booths are spacious and cozy. Normally I want to eat and get out of a place, but I lingered at Draco because of the mellow vibe. 

The staff were very polite and friendly, but we had to get up a few times to find a staff member. The restaurant wasn't busy when we went on a Sunday night, so servers were not easy to find and flag down. 

I wanted to love the food, but in all honesty, the 4 dishes I tried tasted like beautifully plated conference food. 

Duck Confit Poutine -  This was alright but not worth $14. The fries were limp and the gravy tasted flat. Bannock makes a much better duck poutine. 

King Cole Duck Breast - The duck breast itself was good, but I had to send my first plate back because it was tough and overcooked. The 2nd one, cooked medium, was delicious with a crispy skin. The accompanying 'toasted' quinoa was wet, soggy and oddly drippy - I left it on my plate. The broccolini was barely cooked. 

Grilled Flank Steak - My husband ordered this as it was recommended by our server. He asked for it medium rare, it came back overcooked. It also wasn't very flavorful. I would have asked for it to be redone, but he doesn't like to send his food back to the kitchen out of fear it will come back with a side of something else. 

Coconut Pineapple Brule - This was a 3/5, and probably the best dish we had out of the 4 we ordered. There was barely any caramelization or crust on the brule, but the base itself was yummy. The custard was soft and cooked perfectly (not too runny, not too firm). I liked the fruit chunks inside. 

Nonalcoholic Drinks - We ordered the cranberry lime moscow mule and the basil blood orange. Both were okay. They were refreshing but tasted surprisingly watery.

I really wish I had a better review to post... especially since the location is great and the atmosphere is relaxed/comfy, but the food was disappointing, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Excellent service but OK food! We went here around 2:30pm on Sunday and it was pretty much empty. It was a nice, quiet atmosphere and the waiter was very attentive.

We ordered the steak, lobster grilled cheese, sake PEI mussels, duck poutine and beavertail dessert. For appetizer we had the mussels and it was really flavourful but a little salty. It came with two pieces of bread but it was a bit burnt. 

I liked how the duck poutine had big pieces of duck in it and the duck gravy was delicious as well. Lobster grilled cheese was alright and pretty filling for what it was, but a little greasy. It also came with a side of fries but it was too bland alone so I ordered gravy. The steak was not bad, but nothing amazing either. The leek that came with the dish was a bit burnt. 

Lastly, we tried the beavertail dessert and it was pretty standard. Fried dough covered in sugar with chocolate sauce and ice cream. I would come back again for the atmosphere and service but I think the food can be better!"}
{"text":"How to feel like a fancy downtown dweller when you actually live in the 'burbs. 1) Have a swanky cocktail lounge open near you. 2) Go to said swanky cocktail lounge. That's what a bunch of us Yelpers decide to do on a Friday night, living out our Sex and the City moments right here in Markham. Colourful alcohol and gossip flowed liberally. 

While I think nice cocktails are wasted on me (lightweight), I am in love with the IDEA of a nice cocktail lounge. Beautiful open space inside the Marriott with comfortable chairs and inventive drinks. Your sweet tooth would be delighted by their dessert cocktails like the flaming s'mores martini. For the more sophisticated palette, they've got a signature cherry wood smoked Old Fashioned, which comes in a bottle swirling with smoke. It's quite mesmerizing.  

I can personally attest to how nice and strong their cocktails are. Ordered the Lychee Twist thinking I'll get something sweet and fruity. What a surprising kick! Good drink still. We also ordered the Duck Confit Poutine which was good, but not amazing. The first few bites tasted fantastic, but probably because I was hungry and cheese, gravy, and potatoes are the ultimate hunger satisfier. But really, the duck was not particularly flavourful. The fries, however, were nice and crisp. 

I feel like that's consistent with the rest of their food here. Decent, inoffensive, not great but okay. They've got dumplings that cater to the Asian population and a really nice looking Charcuterie board. Personally, I wouldn't come here just for their food, especially at marked-up lounge prices. Cocktails though, absolutely. Draco is setting itself up to be the ultimate happy hour hangout right in the middle of this new downtown.

{"text":"I'm so sad because I wanted to like this place!  I really did!  

(Location:)
This new restaurant is located right inside the new Marriott hotel they built by downtown Markham.  At first glance, it is a high-end place, with fancy drinks, and cool decor.  It also boasts a fusion menu (which is definitely one of my favourite cuisines).  So, of course, I was excited to try!

(Service:)
Although the service was fine, I think we waited around 45 minutes from the time we ordered to the time we got our food delivered.  There was nobody else in this restaurant, so I actually don't understand what took them so long.  I also think that the server wasn't dressed to promote the same vibe that the entire restaurant was trying to emanate.

(Food:)
I got the LOBSTER GRILLED CHEESE, which came with a side of fries that I upgraded to DUCK POUTINE.  The grilled cheese wasn't too bad, but left me feeling super gross and heavy afterwards (I guess I can't blame them for that, but I just didn't feel that great after eating it).

The DUCK POUTINE was very simple, the cheese and gravy was nothing to write home about, and the added duck didn't enhance any flavours.

(Price:)
LOBSTER GRILLED CHEESE: $18

DUCK POUTINE UPGRADE: $4

(Overall:)
Honestly, I wasn't really happy with this place at all.  I paid probably $30 after tax and tip and left feeling like I spent too much time there as well as feeling quite bloated.  I just had higher expectations because of the high rating (although based on 2 reviews) as well as the atmosphere."}
{"text":"When staying at the Marriott hotel for a few days, we stopped in this bar twice to enjoy a cocktail and their time we went, I ordered a Smoked Old Fashioned and my partner ordered an extra dirty vodka martini. Both our drinks were the best that either one of us have ever had! The old fashioned had a light smoky flavor and was the perfect balance of not being straight bourbon, but not being too sweet. As for the martini, I guess it tasted like olives (I don't like dirty martinis)? Either way both drinks just could not have been better. The second night we stopped by and there was a different bartender. We got the same thing and both drinks were just not that great. The old fashioned tasted like I was drinking in the inside of a grill...the only thing I could taste in it was the smoke flavor and it was WAAAAY too strong. The martini had no olive juice in it and tasted way watered down. Super disappointing considering our minds were blown the night before. We'd give them another chance, but would just hope for some consistency."}
{"text":"Wow! Never expected a place like this to land itself in markham! With the new fancy downtown markham, I guess it's found it's perfect home. 

This is inside the Marriott, right at the lobby. If I was staying at the hotel, I'd have an excellent time because I can just come down from my room and access A+ cocktails and delicious food. 

The service is on and off- sometimes it's excellent and sometimes you think it's the first time they ever served in their life (confusion splitting bills, bringing food to the right person etc) Most of the time it's been great for me.

I think everything here is super super unique- cucumber ice cubes?? Insane. All the drinks have a lot of alcohol. No watered down, cheap bar shit here. The food looks delectable - charcutierie board with high quality mustard, duck confit poutine + lobster grilled cheese.. ugh, I'll die getting fat if this is the kind of food I get to eat. Every bite of every food item I tried was deliciouso.

Definitely a recommend from me!"}
{"text":"Our first time here we sat at the bar and had a cocktail. Great place to hang out after seeing a movie across the street. I tried the tequila martini which was a very nice change from the traditional drink. The bartender was so nice to talk to. Can't wait to come back and try something on the menu for lunch or dinner. The decor is modern and classy. Beautifully done! It is nice to have a spot like this so close to home."}
{"text":"Went here last night. I loved the decor and cocktails but the food was just ok. The place is really quiet, I guess because it is still very new. I would love to if they can bring in some live music, kinda like the Shangri-la Hotel Lobby dt.  Fingers crossed"}
{"text":"Gorgeous space -- very classy-looking -- with great service; it really is an awesome spot to get drinks. Loved the refreshing taste of the Rosemary Pineapple Margarita."}
{"text":"Decor and food-wise this is a great hotel lounge/restaurant. Unfortunately, quite dead on a Saturday night. Located in Downtown Markham, not East Markham. The service is slow at times, but overall pretty good. We ordered meat and cheese boards, the duck and the steak. Everything tasted great, but the duck was overcooked. There is a kids menu. Can't comment on cocktails because I only ordered wine. Eventually, as Dontown Markham fills in this could potentially become a hot spot. For now you can have a nice quiet meal on date night, or an intimate evening with your girlfriends. They have a nice selection of desserts too. We'll be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a bit of a hard time finding the restaurant because we didn't realized it was inside the Marriott. I liked the decor of the restaurant and there's an interesting story behind how they designed the place so make sure you ask them for the story! We were seated in the dining area but I saw a cool sports bar area with individual TVs closer to the bar/washrooms.

We ordered the Atlantic Salmon Tartar (edamame, chunky avocado, ponzu cilantro vinaigrette - $15) and Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes (fresh avocado, microgreens + salsa fresca, herb oil - $17). I personally thought that the salmon tartar was better. I enjoyed the freshness of the dish but I wish there were several more pieces of \"toast\" and the ponzu flavour could've been intensified to add a little bit more flavour.

For our mains, we shared the Wild Boar Chop (barley, heirloom carrots, charred corn + scallions - $26) and Grilled Flank Steak (lentils & stewed wild leeks - $23). Between the two dishes, I thought that the boar chop was much more flavourful and tender. I'm not a steak person but my friend enjoyed the steak more.

I would definitely come back here to try their other dishes. It's a nice addition to downtown Markham, giving me more restaurant options near my house."}
{"text":"Perfect hangout spot for drinks after work in Downtown Markham. Finally I don't have to travel all the way downtown for quality cocktails. The drinks at Draco are a solid 5-star!

I had the Draco's Smoked Old Fashioned infused with the smoked Cherry wood, and I was instantly in love. The Cherry wood really brings out the sweetness of the cocktail. I'd definitely order this again! My friend also ordered one but infused with smoked Oak wood, and the smell and the taste was much stronger. I enjoyed both but I still prefer the Cherry wood :)

I also had (yes, I'm an alcoholic!) the Blueberry Moscow Mule, and it was really tasty. I especially enjoy cocktails with ginger beer ^^ It is served and kept cold in a brass mug. Only missing was a bit of (green) garnish.

The Sake-tini was actually quite interesting! This martini is very light and refreshing, made with sake, vodka, and cucumber ice cubes! The light green ice cubes definitely stole the show visually and flavour-wise! If you enjoy sake, this cocktail is made for you ;)

I seriously can't get enough of this place; I'm coming back again with my pals! Catch me here if you are free tonight :)

Food wise: I would highly recommend the Lobster Grilled Cheese but imo don't need to upgrade the fries to the duck confit poutine. Regular fries with ketchup are already tasty.

For improvement: I find the food items I ordered tend to be a bit salty. I would recommend requesting for light salt when ordering next time."}
{"text":"Good:
1. Decor - Located in the decked out, modern hotel lobby.  The restaurant was very trendy.

2. Service - Came for Mother's Day brunch buffet and it got pretty busy with large groups.  Wait staff was friendly and prompt in collecting plates and they seemed to be hustling around in general.

Neutral:
1. Food - Some good, some bad, overall pretty small buffet selection.  Prime rib carving station was great, especially with the grainy mustard.  The rest were just meh.  Bacon and eggs bene were cold, some of the romaine had redness in it.  Felt a little like a standard hotel breakfast but elevated.

Worth it?
Mother's day brunch for $40pp definitely not worth it.  Food quality and selection just wasn't there to justify the price.  Very slight chance we would return for the regular menu."}
{"text":"3.5

I am excited that a \"cocktail\" lounge finally opened in East Markham! I want to sip on fancy cocktails when is perfectly balanced just like I can enjoy one Downtown Toronto.

Draco Markham has a lot of potential. It is not perfect but since it is new, I hope they can and will improve down the road.

Love the drink menu, it does includes a lot of the classic and the bartender is happy to make anything for you, just ask. We tried 4 different drinks and I did notice they were a little water down. Probably from the ice melting too fast in the shakers. 

For a cocktail lounge vibe, they really need to tune down the spotlights during after hours. The main lounge area lighting is just way too bright and white! Perfect for taking photos but not for sipping cocktails.

Service was friendly and cheerful.

I have not try the food as yet, maybe I will be back for that and some more drinks."}
