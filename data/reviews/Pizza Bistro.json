{"text":"I do like the food here but the charge for using your card to pay makes my rating go down. I feel like the quality has declined in the past year as well."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner from here last night and was surprised at how big the wings are!! They are full wings. I ordered Cajun and garlic butter and both were ok but these wings deserve bbq sauce. The pizza was ok. I ordered sausage and felt like there could have been more on it. The cheese cake bites were very good. I ordered caramel with them and was only given 1/4 a little cup:( I don't think this will beat out my go to pizza place but I like the variety they have and the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find low ratings for Pizza Bistro; they're my go-to place! The pizza and hoagies are great and they have by far the best salad I've ever gotten from a pizza shop. I'd recommend."}
