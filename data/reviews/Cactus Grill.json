{"text":"The service is really great and the food is tasty.  I wouldn't give them the full 5 stars because the burritos are a little dry.  However - they do know how to make a fish taco and the fish they use is delicious!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant as it had good reviews and I liked the made-to-order aspect to it. I even drove out of my way to go there. However, I was incredibly disappointed. A veggie burrito is just lettuce, tomatoes, and onions along with the beans and rice. That is not a veggie burrito!! Other places have peppers, sauté onions, etc. and salsa and jalapeños are included in the price elsewhere. If you don't order ahead for pick up, be prepared for sub-par service. Also, make sure you tip or they become incredibly nasty!! I'll stick with chipotle, qdoba, and pancheros."}
{"text":"Really like this place.  Daily lunch specials are my regular choice, $4.99 each.  The burritos are tasty and a good size and everything is fresh."}
{"text":"Has one of the widest varieties of options for varieties for a burrito chain I've even been to. I love that they have tofu as an option but I also can get fish tacos if I'm feeling that. The daily special's are a plus, which made lunch here affordable. They also do free or $1 burrito day which is AWESOME. Good quality food, decent prices, and the management is fantastic. I keep going back when I'm in town. Love it."}
{"text":"I've tried this place a couple of times..  i could not stand how bland the food was. nothing tasted good. the food looked like it was at least a month old.  plus, the last two times I ordered, i didn't get a fork, napkin, and they didn't give me the correct order either. I can't believe I tipped the driver, too."}
{"text":"The chicken tasted like some real chicken. I was in and out, fast and easy. It's the off brand of Chipotle, but the quality is better. Great sized portion. Will be back again."}
{"text":"If I were rating the food only- 5 stars.  I LOVE cactus grill- the Honey Grilled Chicken Taco's are my favorite!    Delivery on the other hand- 0 stars.  Customer service when delivery is bad- also 0 stars.    Called in my lunch order today at 11:30 thinking at the latest they would have it to my by 12:30.  At 12:55 I called to see what was up (I work on campus and that can be hard).  I was told 2-3 minutes.  25 minutes later I called back.  The driver had forgot my coke, they were busy and had new drivers was what I was told.  I said new drivers aside, I placed my order an hour and 45 minutes ago.  He said to only pay $10 for my $20 order and they should be here soon.  Finally they showed up after over 2 hours of waiting.  Then the icing on the cake was that our food was cold (we pretty much expected that) and we were missing sour cream and got the wrong kind of beans in the burrito.    Like I said I LOVE the food at Cactus Grill (when you get it there and it's hot), but their delivery service has a little to be desired."}
{"text":"I love that Cactus Grill offers tofu as a filling in their tacos and burritos.  The quality of the vegetables is a plus."}
{"text":"Cactus Grill is a worthy substitute for Chipotle (I avoid campus if I can and the other location is out of the way). Their daily specials are a fair price and filling. I usually get the burritos in a bowl to save a little on carbs.  I do wish their fish tacos/burritos used something like grilled salmon or tilapia, instead of Gorton's-type fried fish mystery meat.  A big plus is they have Sriracha as a condiment! The Thai-Mexican twist makes me a happy camper!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to get a burrito in town.  The steak is the best, but I usually go with the daily special.  My only minor complaint is if you order delivery, it can take a long time for the food to arrive."}
{"text":"Oh Cactus Grill. I love your lunch specials, and the fact that you deliver. I'm pretty sure the average newborn is smaller than their burritos. I especially love that if you ask nicely on your online order they will draw a unicorn on your burrito wrapper. NOMZ."}
{"text":"Good tofu burritos are hard to come by in Champaign-Urbana. In fact, the Cactus Grill offers the only one I know of at a restaurant in town ... with some nicely grilled veggies. It's an independent, tasty burrito joint in Champaign, IL, so of course it's not quite what you might find in Arizona or California or whatever -- but the food is good and the folks behind the counter know how to use a tortilla."}
{"text":"I know there are a lot of negative reviews of this place, in mid December I stopped in and tried both chipotle and honey tacos. I only really remember the honey tacos being decent. Today I tried it again, this time however the steak burrito was the 5.25 special. A couple notes-  The special is not just lunch but all day.  Also the burrito wrap can be substituted for a bowl which they fill with your choice of  types of beans, rices, salsa and guac ( I presume they would put guac on it if you asked) tomatoes and onions sour cream.  I recommend going in to pick your favs before trying delivery, that being said I was there at 7:30 pm and they have two drivers so there is an attempt to make the delivery service better.  This is point where I have to say the steak bowl was very good! I chose Spanish rice, black beans and the standard veggies with cheese and sour cream, the portion was plenty and the ratios of components was well done,   I recommend going in for your first time to see the options first hand, for me giving it a second chance was worth while."}
{"text":"I started going to Cactus Grill as a student, then continued to make it a regular lunch stop after I stayed in Champaign for a couple years following graduation. I've missed it ever since I moved away. St. Louis has plenty of great food, including great Mexican, but I've never had anything quite like my regular order at Cactus Grill.  Their Honey Grilled Chicken is delicious. I get it on tacos with corn tortillas and all the toppings (mild salsa for me). I've been gone so long I can't remember what day, but on one day three of these tacos is their special.  I was back in town yesterday for the day, and had a full day of activity and eating, but I still made it a point to stop by and grab one of these tacos on my way back out of town. Wish I could get three more today. Come to St. Louis please!"}
{"text":"best burritos in Champaign! do yourself a favor and skip the chain places and enjoy this local treasure. great food, fast service, friendly staff. owner is always there making sure things are running smoothly. i don't think i've ever heard any music playing here. which is totally ok."}
{"text":"Just ordered the steak burrito. I thought the meat was good but on the whole a very simple meal..nothing special. Decent delivery time and decent prices makes this a decent place to order from."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, quick and good. Always order the item on special. Tuesdays are (3) Tacos, but I usually go for Thursday's Quesadilla Taco combo. Special prices have moved up to 5.70, but it's still worth it. Only challenge is the parking lot, as it's narrow... and people do not know how to park. Oh well... still worth it."}
{"text":"I've been going here at least once a week for the past year or so. The food is consistently great, the staff is very friendly, and they are able to make your meal quickly.  This is basically like a local version of Chipotle. The menu is very similar. But, in my opinion, Cactus Grill has much better food. The $5.25 daily specials are a steal as well!  I highly recommend the honey grilled chicken burrito or the fish burrito."}
{"text":"I had the honey grilled chicken burrito.  I thought it was good.  You can choose white rice, spanish rice, pinto beans, black beans to add to it.  You also have the choice of tomato, onion, lettuce, hot sauce or mild, sour cream.   The people working there were very helpful and let me try samples of the chicken before ordering.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't think it's there yet.  Also, the fish tacos are really awesome."}
{"text":"I always go on Thursdays but everyday has a good special for the budget conscious folks."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak burrito today and placed my order at 11:08.  12:55 rolls around and still no food so I called the store to see what the holdup was.  The guy on the other end says he'd get in touch with the delivery driver and see what was going on; this after telling me it should be 33 minutes because his driver was on my side of town.  I hung up expecting that he'd call and give me a new more accurate time to expect my food but 1:10 comes without a call and at this point I'm ready to cancel my order unless they're willing to take off some of the price for the long wait.  As I'm on the phone with him the second time my food finally came.   I shouldn't have tipped the driver but I did after he said that he'd gotten lost.    On to the food itself.  The flavor was good when I tasted it.  Very unevenly distributed throughout my lukewarm meal in what  should have been a satisfyingly large burrito.  The rice was very bland in many parts and the sauce was a far cry from what I consider spicy.  To be fair I grew up in Texas so they may have been catering to Midwestern spicy which isn't nearly spicy enough for a south/southwest pallet.  For the $12 I paid after the tip, I should have gotten much better for my money.    Oh and how they justify a $2 charge for delivery (which I found out after the driver was long gone) is beyond me.  It's too bad because I really wanted to like this place.  Maybe I'll have a better experience dining in but I might not have the stomach or wallet to give them a second chance.  A free or largely discounted meal would go a long way in chalking this up to a fluke."}
{"text":"Great food for carry out, do not order delivery unless you do not plan on being hungry for a couple of hours."}
{"text":"Best burritos in town for sure.  I won't even go to chipotle, moes, or poncheros because cactus grill shuts them down."}
{"text":"This D-I-V-E is delish!!  Cactus Grill was close to my hotel and it was taco Tuesday.  I ended up getting the Chipotle Chicken taco salad.  If we had this place in Atlanta, I would never get taco salad anywhere else.   The chicken was excellent, perfectly seasoned.  There was more chicken than lettuce! And the shell!  It was light and crispy, the perfect accompaniment to the spicy salsa!  I planned on leaving the shell, but I just couldn't.  I ate the whole thing.  I will definitely be back!  I do recommend take out.  There is very little seating."}
{"text":"This is a local establishment that serves hot fast delicious food. I tried the special of the day a chicken burrito and got the chipotle style chicken. It was awesome! The cilantro rice was tasty and the sauté peppers and onions gave it a good balance. If you haven't checked this place out, you really should."}
{"text":"Mediocre mexican. Priced awesome if you get the special and it's only about $5 for lunch and you have very low expectations. My fourth time trying this place,  I ordered a burrito for delivery. Nearly 2hrs later, it still had not arrived. Called to cancel my order and the manager answered. As soon as i requested to cancel my order, he said \"okay, I'll call the driver.\" and immediately hung up. I've been disappointed each time I've tried this place and this was my last time.  Absolutely would not recommend. Pancheros or Chipotle are a MUCH better option over Cactus Grill. McDonald's would be a better option. Barf."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Small business, similar to Chipotle but MUCH better in my personal opinion. Daily specials all for 5.25 everyday they're open. You cannot go wrong with honey grilled chicken  I also go in there often and purchase just chicken by the pound for meals I want to cook at home."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their lunch specials; cheap and taste good. I used to prefer bowls over burritos but this place changed my mind. I'd recommend their honey grilled chicken and spicy salsa."}
{"text":"In champaign for work and had tried this place due to the great reviews. Needless to say I was quite underwhelmed. I ordered the chipotle steak taco salad. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good. It had the potential to be good. However, the meat had so much gristle that it felt like I was chewing on rubber. I had also ordered chips and nacho cheese as it stated that it was a menu favorite. I wouldn't know how good it was because I never received it. I'll give it two stars as opposed to one because the black beans were actually tasty."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for a co worker and I . I ordered the honey grilled chicken burrito and nacho cheese and chips. The burrito itself was pretty good, next time I'll get the chipotle chicken, I felt the honey chicken was a bit overly sweet for a burrito, other than that it was great! Delivery was fast and food was hot!"}
{"text":"My dad's a regular here, the owner knows him and everything, and some weeks I join him for lunch (he's a professor at the u of I and I'm a student). Honestly I really enjoy the food here. I'm not very picky but I'm not a Neanderthal. By my judgment the food is great, it's fast if you just drive there and get your order to go, and the staff is amazingly friendly. I like not supporting an overpriced corporate chain. And you get a lot of food for your money."}
{"text":"First experience with this restaurant. I ordered the chicken quesadilla fajita style. I literally had to pick off maybe half of an onion chopped into tiny pieces. I love onions, but in moderation."}
{"text":"My wife and I are friends with the owners and they are good people that really like serving the community.  I'd recommend this place to anyone plus it is a better way to support Champaign small business owners not some big franchise like McDonald's or chipotle.  Oh yeah their honey grilled chicken burritos are glorious. Haha."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not impressive either. Too expensive unless you get the daily special. I'll stick to Maize next time."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian and tex- mex lover, I feel the need to rave about this place. I LOVE the tofu tacos! The hot suace is good and spicey, the tofu cooked just right, and the price is right!"}
{"text":"loved the daily specials, fish burrito is awesome.  chipotle sauce is awesome on anything there.  must try and fast delivery, thanks!"}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best quick meals that I really enjoy. I go there a lot. The same few guys are usually working and whip the food up quick. They have a $4.99 daily deal that always hits the spot and their honey grilled chicken oh honey don't get me started That and their steak quesadillas are my regular. Chips and guac is a must you get a monster guac thing so you don't run out I hate when I run out of guac. There fish burrito is good too load up on the special fishy sauce I like it. The tacos are good too. Man everything is good and you should just check this spot out. I don't really mess with the delivery cause it takes like 30 minutes and you can be in and out in 5. You can win a free burrito at the gumball machine but I'm currently 0 for like 100 so not likely. But yeah this place is better then waiting in that chipotle line plus I just like it more better bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"As someone who works in the Neil Street area, I am dismayed that most lunch times options are limited to typical restaurant chains.  Luckily, I can count on Cactus Grill when I want a fast lunch that is less corporate than a McBurger.  The quality of the food is near mediocre; some ingredients really shine, but others somehow always disappoint.  Many of the meats (chicken, steak) are chewy and dry, though they're left to soak in their juices before service (doesn't help, unfortunately).  For my meat option, I usually stick with the fish, which is deep-fried in a panko-like batter.  The fish dishes also usually come with a drizzle of creamy chipotle sauce, yum.  Recently I bought a burrito with cilantro-lime rice and black beans.  The rice is an unmistakable (but poor) imitation of the rice from Chipotle, with cilantro that is never mixed in evenly.  When I bit into the beans, I realized they were still...undercooked?  I was pretty surprised by this discovery as most places use pre-made, canned beans rather than beans cooked in-store...so compliments to homemade beans, but disappointment at undercooked beans.  Despite my criticisms, I still return to Cactus Grill every other week to pick up food.  It's not luxury, but I don't expect too much from lunch on a weekday."}
{"text":"I do love this place! I like the options, the specials, and the prices. I also like that it's not a super chain like Pancheros or Chipotle. The only down side is the lack of white meat chicken. I dislike that it's all dark meat. Otherwise I love Cactus Grill!"}
{"text":"I *really* wanted to at least add a star to my review of Cactus Grill on a return visit, but I'm very disappointed to say that I can't bring myself to do so.  It happens to be very convenient to my work to go, so I decided to go on a day when burritos were the special of the day.  Wednesday's special is  Steak Burrito for $4.99, so I went with that, even though everyone who DOES like this place says that the Honey Grilled Chicken is the way to go.   Since I was getting the special, I decided to get a side of chips and salsa, thinking that just in case the burrito was terrible, at least I could snack on the chips.  To their credit, the burrito was much better fare than my previous experience with the tacos.  I got the cilantro rice and black beans, but the steak just does not have that much flavor.   I got the spicy green salsa, and this salsa does carry some heat with it when you have quite a bit of it at once.  It had very little shredded cheese on it, which could have at least been a saving grace if there had been more -- they should think about going with a cheese sauce (ala Qdoba's Steak Queso burrito).  Overall, it was food and probably a decent deal for the $5 special, but I wasn't impressed on taste.  So...the chips.   These were not even close to the life preserver for which I was hoping.  The chips were cold, HARD, and downright inedible.  They were only barely salted, and honestly, I was afraid I might chip a tooth.  I ate about 4, and that's all I could bear.  I got the hot salsa with those as well, and even tried soaking them a bit, but I ended up throwing most of them away.  I'm sorry to those who do enjoy Cactus Grill and can't understand why I'm down on them.  Like I said before, I would like to see them succeed.  There is a severe lack of variety for lunch on south Neil near my work, and this would be a nice location if the food was more up to par.  I will give it one more shot with the chicken, just because i like burritos but refuse to fight the campus parking/traffic.  If it improves significantly, I will post an update."}
{"text":"I really do dislike writing bad reviews for anything, but I feel this experience merits a warning. I just moved here from south Texas, was really craving Mexican food, and felt too lazy to go sit in a restaurant, so delivery it was. I ordered a cheese quesadilla (with onion and tomato for a sad attempt at pico de gallo), and chips and salsa.  The quesadilla was incredibly greasy, the tomato chunks were quite large, and the onion was far too overpowering for my taste. The chips and salsa were another matter. The chips were edible, but they weren't my favorite. And warning with the salsa, if you order the spicy salsa, expect green salsa. I'm used to red, so the possibility of green didn't even cross my mind. I'm not a fan of green salsa, so my dislike is likely an artifact of my dislike of green salsa in general, not this specific salsa.  Plus side? The food was delivered about half an hour earlier than estimated.  Looking at the rest of the reviews, it doesn't appear that Cactus Grill is ALWAYS bad, so maybe mine was just a bad experience, but still...  TL;DR: greasy quesadilla, hard chips, green salsa, searching for another Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on a Saturday night and wanted to try something different.  I ordered a chicken burrito bowl with guacamole and a fish taco. The bowl was on special for $5.25.  I ordered through grubhub and delivery was kind of slow, a little over 1 hour and 10 minutes, which I guess is to be expected on a busy Saturday night. The ordering itself though was very easy and convenient on grub hub.  The fish taco was surprisingly good. The fish tasted fresh, and it was a fairly large size with all the toppings. I really liked the fish and the sauce it came with. My burrito bowl was also quite tasty. The honey grilled chicken was flavorful and appeared to be of good quality. There was no shortage of toppings, especially the guacamole I paid a ~$1.30 extra for, this was fresh and delicious. The portion was large enough to save half for later, too!  Overall for ~$15 delivered this was a pretty good deal. I'm not quite sure if it was better than Chipotle, but it was definitely cheaper for a comparable product. I would get Cactus Grill again for sure."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their chicken is good, but they have a tofu fajita burrito that is amazing! Great customer service, always fresh food, and good prices. Best Mexican place in Champaign (and that includes Maize!)"}
{"text":"So I'm back here to change my review. And they have really gotten better. Honey grilled chicken burritos on monday are the BOMB! I try to make it here once a week. Delivery has gotten much better and I tend to get my order in under an hour. Go Cactus Grill!"}
{"text":"This in an awesome spot, certainly one of the most under-appreciated places near UIUC campus. Extremely reasonably priced for consistently great food. I always do pick-up, but Cactus Grill is also one of the few (only?) Tex-Mex restaurants that do delivery."}
{"text":"Ordered for lunch at work yesterday and all of us agreed that for the price it was not worth it - it was just okay.  Steak Chipotle Burrito was big; but, like most places they are made in such a way that you just get large pockets of one thing in each bite.  Panchero's at least mixes theirs a bit.  The steak was gray with a  non-discript flavor; but at least was chopped small enough that it didn't seem chewy.  My spicy salsa was not apparent in the meal.  The jalapeños were all lumped together in one of those aforementioned pockets.  Chips were okay, tad greasy but good salt level. Guac tasted like it was the prepackaged stuff you can buy in plastic bags in the produce section of the grocery store - it had that weird citric acid aftertaste that you don't get with fresh made guac.    Did I still eat it?  Yes, I was hungry and I paid for it!  Was I disappointed? Yes, I had heard good things about the place... Live and Yelp, I mean learn!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review Inexpensive, fast, mexican food would be the four words to summarize your experience at Cactus Grill. This restaurant is located in a small strip mall that is adjacent to subway and Espresso Royale. Very limited parking spot and you may even miss the entrance when you come the first time. When you go order it is just like Chipotle, however the rice is not cilantro rice but spanish rice and the ingredients appear to be slightly lesser quality in terms of freshness and taste, however the daily special at 5.25 make up for this. Check out the pictures I scanned of the menu to determine which days you want to go. Otherwise the burrito is way better than the panchero burrito. So if you don't have to travel to prospect or on campus for chipotle, this can be your one stop shop.   Pros: cheap daily specials, quick, inexpensive  Cons: very small parking lot, hard to get in, lower quality than chipotle. The honey chicken reminds me of the chicken you get at the asian restaurants at the mall. Some poor health code violations which can make you leary, however that price still wins me over :)  Hidden deals:  Daily special 5.25 Monday- Chicken burrito Tuesday- 3 chicken taco Wednesday- Steak burrito Thursday- Chicken quesadilla and chicken taco Friday- Fish, tofu, or veggie burrito Saturday- Chicken burrito  Health code rating: D. There are some terrible food handling reviews. It was recently covered in the newspaper as well. \"The restaurant received an adjusted score of 30 and seven critical violations, including foods at preparation tables being improperly stored, a delivery from the morning still sitting out and raw meat being dispensed inside the undersized, walk-in cooler.\"   http://il.healthinspections.us/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=1361"}
{"text":"Ordered the steak burrito bowl via a food delivery app because I had zero desire to get up off the couch. Delivery was about an hour which is standard for the app/ordering system. Came about ten minutes before the latest predicted time so that was nice. Burrito bowl was delicious with LOTS of steak, good amount of rice and the cilantro lime rice actually tasted like it had lime in it without being overwhelming. I ordered the guacamole as well which was an awesome life choice. I'm a guac snob but it was flavorful without being overpowering. (Too much raw onion isn't fun for anyone even if you aren't locking lips later on tonight. :) Portion was large enough that I'll probably finish it for lunch tomorrow AND it was a very reasonable price. Props from this quasi Mexican food lover. :)"}
{"text":"Dude how could I not be a fan when my first experience with this place is that they hand me a gigantic, free chicken burrito??  I hope that they get some spillover traffic from the Subway next door, because I can tell the locals that own the franchise are workin' hard and I don't want them to get eaten by economy like so many other local businesses (i.e., papa george, sweet indulgence, pages for all ages)"}
