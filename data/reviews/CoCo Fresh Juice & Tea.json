{"text":"I was very surprised with my extreme disappointment on my experience with the Coco location on Yonge St on the early evening at 6pm on May 27. It is clear that they need to learn from their predecessors like the Scarborough location, who consistently executes fantastic customer service, constantly catering to the demands of all customers to the best of their abilities. Now, I know certain requests cannot be followed through such as asking for less ice in a slush. But I had a very simple request of asking for a little extra lemon juice in the lemon Yakult which was rudely turned down by the cashier, Ann. She said they cannot do that, and I responded by informing that all other Coco locations (Scarborough, Markham, North York and Richmond Hill) allowed it. Again, she said it cannot be done so I let it go and continued with my order for the promotion of buying two top 10 drinks for a free medium bubble tea. Before the transaction was complete, cashier Ann asked if all other locations really allowed that request and I said yes, but that this is the only location that refuses. She then complacently stated that those locations are doing things wrong and are not allowed to adhere to such requests, with a smug smile. At this point, I was getting annoyed but did not say anything. Finally, right before she handed me my drinks, she actually held onto them in the bag which she pulled closer and closer to herself, with a complacent smile and explaining that they have strict recipes they need to follow for audit and QC purposes and that the coming Monday, they will get audited. As she was explaining this, I was getting fed up, requesting to get my drinks, trying to reach for them, but cashier Ann continued her obviously smug smile, pulling the drinks away and refusing to give them to me. As a customer, I do not care the about the reasoning behind her refusal. Coco is one of the very few bubble tea locations that pride themselves on customer service. If this was Chatime, I would not be surprised as they have terrible service. If this was McDonald's,  I would not be surprised either. But even McDonald's cater to my customization without any conceitedness. I was already thinking about never coming back to this Coco Yonge location after the first few remarks by cashier Ann, but her last action and smug attitude has  made it so much easier for me to never return and inform all those I can to stay away from such horrible service. Furthermore, this location is the only one that does not warmly greet their customers as they walk in. The Scarborough location constantly welcomes all customers that walk in from the door, both in English and Mandarin, and from both the cashiers and bartenders! This crucial customer service step was completely omitted from this location, with the bartenders' long faces, backs to customers and condescending attitude from cashier Ann. This was by far, my worst experience ever at a Coco location and it was so not worth it to go for the promotion. Just an FYI for the readers, I know some people quite well who work at the other Coco locations and they confirmed that my extra lemon juice request was valid and do-able and will not be frowned upon from their inspection, as customer service is their #1 priority. I've also seen the Scarborough location allowing just a little extra bubbles for customers without charging extra. Now THAT is what I call defining great customer service! I would like to end off by warning everyone to stay away from the Yonge location and to go to the best Coco in Toronto - which is the Scarborough store! The managers and owners know what they are doing as they have the best team! They have the best taste, as they cater to your needs as best as they can and they do so, with a friendly attitude! There is one particular employee, Julia, at the Scarborough location that excels to perfection. She is hardworking, fast, accurate, friendly and professional when making drinks, taking orders and attending to kitchen work as it is all clearly visible. Julia truly deserves a raise and promotion! The store would be at an advantage with her as the manager! Everyone should learn from Julia at Coco Scarborough, especially Coco Yonge's cashier Ann. I do not know what was the matter with cashier Ann and her attitude. After all, she is just but a cashier and anyone can easily do that job."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Although it might look nice, but the quality is not as good as chatime.  Nothing is really special about this place. The service is slow. Only two people for the entire shop? My gf and I both had diarrhea after drinking the bubble tea. Won't recommend."}
{"text":"Always a great experience to go there, great consistency and great service. My favourite drinks are Babo Gaga and Two lady."}
{"text":"Recommend you to try red bean milk tea with 30% surge."}
{"text":"Coco is the place to go if you love Hokkaido milk tea cuz they definitely know how to please. 

2 Ladies & Baby Gaga (4.5/5): 2 ladies is short the grass jelly in 3 guys, but still a fantastic drink. I got the entire drink regular (sugar, ice, etc.) and the milk tea wasn't too sweet nor bitter, just right. I'd have to admit that the pudding is one giant piece so you've got to break it up with your straw somehow but overall would be back again to try the 3 guys lol. Got to take a couple sips of the Baby Gaga with 50% sugar and I'd recommend this drink to anyone looking for something super refreshing!

Cost (3/5): paid around $11 for both large drinks so it's pretty standard for good bbt in Toronto.

Service (4.5/5): Went on a Sunday afternoon and the line up was about 3 people in front of me, however it was fast and I was greeted by a rather chipper cashier. The drinks are all wiped down before they are handed to you, so what more can I ask for? Good service overall :)

Ambience (4/5): the place itself is really cute and something you could get cozy for some time, whether it's to catch up with a group of friends or spend sometime doing some work. I had take out, but I would come back to chill as well :)

Overall, would recommend!"}
{"text":"I tried their signature Milk Tea with bubbles. For some reason, my tapoica balls were all stuck together and the texture was overly chewy and a bit dry. I think the tapoica must have been sitting out for a long time. 

The milk tea itself was ok- not bad. I do much prefer Chatime's signature pearl milk tea."}
{"text":"Visited CoCo on a Tuesday night and it was quite busy. I've had CoCo in China before and I thought it was an okay bubble tea joint. I ordered the teas of the month - passion fruit black tea and caramel milk tea with sugar. 

Positives:
Lots of bubbles. I hate when bbt places skimp on the bubbles even when they are charging for them. Not here! They give plenty of bubbles and they are done right. Texture and taste are a-okay! 

Negatives:
Sugary. I got 30% sugar in the milk tea and 50% sugar in the passion fruit. I thought both were too sweet for my liking. If I went back I would just ask for no sugar in any of my drinks. It's possible they keep the bubbles in syrup so it's adding alot of sugar to the drink.

Overall I would say for the price point, I would rather go to a chatime or teashop 168 for my bubble tea. The bubble serving was generous but the tea itself wasn't that great. I prefer the more tea-heavy bubble tea places. 

Tip - they do vicinity loyalty cards so if you buy 10 drinks you get one free."}
{"text":"The bubble tea was pretty good here. Very comparable to chatime and their taro is way better than chatime's. 4 stars because the service however was super slow the one time my boyfriend and I went. Waited over 30 minutes for 2 regular sized bubble teas.. I know they just opened and they're busy because of their promotion but 30 minutes is just insane. Regardless, the bubble tea, and tapioca was very tasty"}
{"text":"They have special promotion of $3.88 for large bubble teas.
Coco is located not too far from either Yonge or Wellesley station.
I wish they have BRANDY MILK TEA, I had them in NYC branch, it was the best!
I asked the worker there, they don't even know about it.
Come on BBT + Brandy, who will say no?!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, one of the cashiers is so cute, and he speaks 5 languages.

The environment is wonderful, a perfect place for you to meet your high school friends and catching up with things you never knew back when you were in high school. Of course, this all happens companied by bubble tea. 


 :)"}
{"text":"Came here randomly and was a pleasant surprise.  Never heard of CoCo before but learnt they are pretty much worldwide and claims to be the largest BBT chain in the world.  Def got to try this out. Got the Sago Taro and the Mango Yakult.  Both were pretty good.  Will need to try the 3 guys as I heard that was their signature drink."}
{"text":"#First  

Bomb bubble tea. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Flexible with customizations. Drink flavours with every topping you could want for indecisive foodies like me. 3 guys is my drink of choice - milk tea with tapioca, pudding and grass jelly all in one joyous cup. 

Free wifi and sweet cubby benches for large groups. 

Drink here!"}
{"text":"There was this cashier that's shit rude, and ended up getting my drink wrong anyways. Lol why is she always there when I go."}
{"text":"I'm going LoKo for my CoCo!

3 GUYS:
3 Guys is my favorite drink here. Signature Pearl Milk Tea with Grass Jelly and Mango Pudding. The combination of toppings give such a unique experience: chewy from tapioca, slightly bitter from grass jelly, sweet from mango pudding and umami from the tea. That's almost all taste sensations in one drink!

This is probably the MOST VALUE bubble tea there is because you get 3 toppings for just $5 regular or $5.5 large. Where in other places like Chatime or Gong Cha, you'll need to pay for extra 2 or 3 toppings, which is $1-1.8, to match the same.


SAGO TARO MILK TEA:
Such a refreshing drink for Taro lovers. Coming from the Philippines where sago is popular, I just love the sago here. I haven't seen other places offering sago. What I would've liked more is if they have real taro bits like they do in Chatime.

My tip is to also add Tapioca. Then you'll have a really bubbly day :)


MATCHA MACCHIATO:
This was my least favorite out of what I've tried. I'm a big matcha lover - the stronger the better. I find the matcha to be too weak for my liking. I also prefer the Cream Foam at Gong Cha. The cream foam just didn't have that unique umami taste that Gong Cha has.


BLACK TEA MACCHIATO:
I tried this following a friend's recommendation since it's her favorite. I really liked. The tea taste is very strong and perfectly balanced by the Cream Foam.


Fun Fact:
I find it so interesting that CoCo Tea makes 100 Pearl Milk Teas every second across the globe."}
{"text":"They run good weekly specials but I can't deal with how SLOW the service is here. No matter what time of day you come, it's as if one employee is taking orders and also making the drinks. They don't take the next order until they finish making the previous drink. So inefficient and frustrating!

*and they refused to make my drink without tapioca even though they did it last time. Wtf? It's cheaper for them if I don't want tapioca. Now I get to spit out every single tapioca from my drink."}
{"text":"CoCo is usually busy. I love their pearl milk tea. The tapiocas are soft. I haven't tried any of the other drinks. There are plenty of bubble tea shops on yonge street around CoCo, but I've liked CoCo the best thus far."}
{"text":"??????coco? (: ???bubble tea?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????Lemon King?????????????????????????????... ???????????..."}
{"text":"This is my favourite bubble tea spot! I like the simplicity and the wide range of variety offered to customers. I love the mini tapioca that you're able to get here! It's rare I find it and for me it's the reason I'll pick this spot over any others. The service is always prompt and I never have any complaints on the flavour or taste of my drink! I reccomend"}
{"text":"What can I say?
The drinks here are standardized to the company's reputation, which, granted, have their own peculiar taste (sweeter milk?), but are still quite good. I've been a frequent customer to this franchise for a while now so I'm content to see that they've now expanded to a downtown Toronto location.

Though only a small bubbletea store, they have a seating area that was basically filled when I got there around 5pm on a Thursday. The noise level was considerably high so the cashier had trouble hearing me and my friends make our orders - but she was friendly and consistently checked with us for clarification. 

But really, I'm only here because of the grand opening BOGO promotion (that ends Feb 29, 2016). Sure, Coco's is good.. but for regular price, I would bargain that I could get better bbt from one of the many alternatives nearby."}
{"text":"As much as I love CoCo from Asia (the 3 Guys drink especially is still unique in the North American market), this new location simply disappointed in service.  While I understand that you're running a BOGO promotion for your grand opening, and there will be high demand, how can a bubble tea store have NEITHER BUBBLES NOR TEA?!

We visited on a Sunday afternoon, waited about 15 minutes in line while some issues were being dealt with from earlier orders.  That wouldn't normally be a problem but when we finally got to order, we were told there is no tea due to an \"electricity issue\", so that the only drinks available are Yakults and juice-based drinks...  Then my friend asked if at minimum, they have tapioca.  The answer to that was also \"unfortunately not right now\".  If a shop does not have more than half their menu avaialble, then I think it warrants letting your customers know through a sign on the door or at least as SOON as they walk into the store.  People in line should not have been waiting for those 15 minutes AND have to order drinks unsuccessfully before finding out nothing was available.  We promptly informed the rest of the line and everyone pretty much walked out.

Anyway, not worth the time or the hassle until they get their customer service act together."}
{"text":"Good bubble tea. One of the best in town. I love the variety and the flavor they have. Always have to queue up, all throughout the day, but they are managing it very well so you don't have to spend a lot of time in line."}
{"text":"Love this Boba tea shop!  Went in NYC everytime I go and visit I must stop by there for my boba Fix. I like that they have the option for Hot on the days that it is cold. :)"}
{"text":"Almost a four star. Oh so close. It's unfortunate the mango slush I ordered was not made with any fresh fruits. It was just flavouring and ice.

However, what kept them firmly out of two star territory was their milk tea. Although not as strong, flavourful and aromatic as what one would find in the Far East (or some others in Toronto), this would do."}
{"text":"Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Very cute place and love their milk tea. The cup for hot drinks is super cute! I hope they keep up the quality!"}
{"text":"Staff are always friendly and fast.  The drinks are always delicious and it's cheaper than most bubble tea shops around."}
{"text":"I've loved bubble tea since forever, and have tried many different brand myself. And gotta say, Coco has become my new favorite. The best drink I would recommend here is 3 guys (with 30% sugar)"}
{"text":"Best bubble tea place I've tried. Friendly staff, Great taste and usually very fast service. Get their number one Pearl Milk Tea."}
{"text":"Okay bubble tea place.  Selection was good, not as expansive as you might find elsewhere but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I liked the fact that the tapioca pearls are of the sweetened variety, and that you can adjust the overall sugar content of the drink.

Problem was that there was a giant line-up of young people from counter to door and it took forever (worked well for us since we were trying to kill some time when we visited), probably due to the fact that prices here are definitely on the cheaper side.

Flavour and quality, average.  Price, cheap."}
{"text":"I will always choose Coco's over Chatime. Just something about the milk tea that tastes better than other bubble tea shops. Prices are standard, a small cup with a topping will cost around $5. You also have the option to modify the amount of ice and sugar in your drink. 

I can get the milk tea here without any sugar and it'll still taste great. The tapioca is bouncy and is never under or over cooked. 

They accept vincinty cards here so make sure you bring yours or sign up for one to get free drinks! 

There's also some seating available inside, but it's not particularly pleasant in the winter months since it's cold from people walking in and all the snow/slush from outside melts into a watery mess."}
{"text":"Grand opening of the downtown locatoon today and they have a buy one get a free pearl milk tea special going on to celebrate that happens throughout February! (See the picture posted for more details)

I will probably be making a few visits to take advantage of the promotion. 

The environment is clean and inviting. It is small but that is nothing new for the downtown as space is a premium.  Just a nice place to grab a hot or cold drink and catch up with some friends. 

Definitely can't go wrong if you get something from their top 10 most popular list."}
{"text":"This is rare since I mostly like all bubble tea places but this one is quite lacklustre for being the largest franchise of bubble tea shops.  I'd say that the lemon king I tried up in North York was very tasty but at the end, it was just a lemonade.  I tried the chocolate red bean tea and it really had that fake chocolate taste from a cheap fudgesicle. I'd say that you should just walk down a bit to chatime instead. I find the bubble tea near yonge and bloor isn't the best including share tea and the now closed hitea.  Worth a try but don't expect magic."}
{"text":"I love the Coc, everyone knows it. \"The Coc\" is what Toronto locals call CoCo Fresh Juice & Tea by the way. I'm not sure what you were thinking I was saying but you were wrong. As usual. You have such a dirty mind.

Actually the Torontonononians don't say much about CoCo because it's as yet largely undiscovered, and definitely underrated. Which is sad, because as chains go and as bubble tea goes, it's utterly incredible.

What to get: Hot Milk Tea or Cold Milk Tea with Bubbles.
What not to get: Shingles, unless you're Terry Bradshaw.

I can only assume that rivals are writing reviews of Coco, because it's every bit as good as Gong Cha and Sharetea (the other international chains that are opening nearby), and perhaps in some ways, better.

This is an awesome little location of Coco, the place I first discovered and fell in love with in Queens (NYC) where they have several excellent locations. I first tried the hot version of their perfect, life-changing milk tea here in Toronto and it was utterly divine. My travel partner (not the cat) actually thinks it's better than my fave (Sharetea) and my 3rd fave (Gong Cha). I put Coco in 2nd place, but they're all very, very good and comparable. And the milk here is gentler and creamier somehow.

Awesome little place, ratings are inexplicable, delicious hot tea"}
{"text":"Tried CoCo tea for the first time. I ordered the 3 Guys Drink which has milk pudding and tapioca with 100% ice and sugar. I thought it was quite good and I love their brewed tea. I've always been curious how their bubble tea tastes like cause I have always been an avid Chatime fan. This location is small and has limited seating. It just opened not too long ago so its quite busy being the only location in the downtown core. I also used my vicinity card to collect the points here. This is the case with most bubble tea places these days."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend, and it was my first time at Coco. We had the large 3 guys (milk tea with tapioca, grass jelly and pudding). The cashier was not very helpful when I asked her how the vicinity card works and if my chatime card would work or not. She had no reaction and was just dry in answering to my questions. 
Secondly, we could see them making the drinks and we could see how inconsistent was the pudding that they put in it. Could be over in 1 or 2 sips. Moreover, I ordered mine with 50% sugar, and it was sweet as if it was regular sugar... 
Overall, the drink was not bad, but too sweet so I couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Hmm this place is addictive. But so unhealthy. 
So I'll start off by saying, I hate bubble tea. I tried it in high school and hated it. I avoided it for 10 years but when given a free sample, I explained to the lady how my tastes had changed, my palate was more refined, all while taking a sip and quickly spitting the bubbles back into the cup.
So much for a refined palate. 
I still hate bubble tea, but I do like tea.

On my way to yoga, CoCo was handing out some sweet looking, bubble-less, purple drank samples, which they informed me was \"milk tea\". I tried this groovy looking drink and I'm pretty sure my pupils instantaneously widened. I looked like Homer after he licked the frog (at least, that's how I felt). 
They gave me a coupon and I went and bought a large taro milk tea with no ice.

They give you an option of how sweet you want it and how much ice you'd like in it. I chose 60% sweet.
The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because they use fructose to sweeten their drinks. I thought it'd be something healthier. I wasn't a fan of that and it's the reason I haven't been back since.
The drink tasted good. If they had smaller straws so I didn't gulp it down in one sip, that'd be great."}
{"text":"This is my go-to bubble tea place apart from Chatime. Both the Mississauga location and this one have great service and the tea is ON POINT! Tasty :)"}
{"text":"I was driving around town last weekend with a friend and all of a sudden I had a craving for bubble tea. I'd heard of this place before but hadn't been yet, so I figured we'd give it a shot. 

I drove down a side street looking for a parking spot and lucked out about 2 blocks away. I paid $3.00 to park for an hour, which I suppose wasn't too bad for the area. I ordered the 3Guys, which happened to be on special for the month. Score! It was really good, and I regret not getting a second one before leaving. Downside was that the tables were filthy and the place was pretty busy, so I guess they had to focus on making drinks over cleaning up after messy guests."}
{"text":"Finally open! Coco in my opinion is better than Chatime. The lines are shorter and they have pudding milk tea. Get the Coco vicinity card to save points for a free drink. They have Buy one large get one free medium off their Top 10 most ordered drinks. Ends Feb 29."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong choosing their pearl milk tea. 

I always get it with large, less ice, and 30% sweet. The tapioca are fresh because they're so chewy. 
It's my favorite all time summer drink.

P.s, get a vicinity card and start collecting points. The 10th drink is free."}
{"text":"This location is close to Yonge and Wellesley which is perfect if you're looking to grab a drink nearby after dinner or just to hang out. I like how they designed the walls for this place with a black board displaying a cute diagram of how tapioca is made and a huge Coco logo on a green textured wall. The place can be quite busy but all the orders come out fast and made exactly to your likings. 

I ordered milk tea without tapioca/jellies with regular sugar and ice to share with my bf (too full to have my own). I loved the taste of the roasted milk tea and it wasn't overly sweet at all even with regular sugar. The flavours are more pronounced than other milk teas at different bbt stores which are often overpowered by the milky taste. I can't wait to try other bbt flavours such as the taro milk tea and black tea macchiato!"}
{"text":"Another BBT chain that has slowly been rising up from the multitudes of BBT options in GTA.  Drinks come in the typical see through plastic cup with a sealed top. You can customize the ice and sugar, which is always greatly appreciated. Standard BBT pricing of around $5, a little extra for bigger sizes. I had the matcha red bean milk tea with 30% sugar and less ice. It came out perfectly to my liking, without being too sweet. If you like your tapioca and jellies, I would recommend the 'three guys' milk tea. It comes with tapioca, grass jelly and pudding. When you are done the drink, it feels like you've eaten a meal because there is so much to eat in the cup. 

This location has some seating, around three round couch areas for larger groups and one two-ppl seater right by the cashier desk. However, a lot of patrons just stopped by to order and was out the door again. Maybe more smaller tables and seats would be a better setup for this tiny shop."}
{"text":"I've only been there about nine times, only because it's a bit of a walk or it'll be closed by the time I get off work. But whenever I did, the drinks always taste incredible as ordered.

However, I was there yesterday and the cashier was really nice, and told me how many points I have without me even asking. Nice! She used my name and had asked if I had been Boxing Day shopping while I waited for my drinks. I didn't have to ask for a bag, she simply gathered my two drinks and placed them into the bag. Afterward, I said my thanks and even got a \"have a good day, Amanda!\" which definitely lit up the mood of the upcoming pouring rain. I wish I had gotten her name because she was so nice to me and all the customers. 

I'll definitely be back sometime next week to get my last point before my free drink! Thank you again for such a wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Got two cold drinks and asked for a cup sleeve and was told that cup sleeves are only available for customers who order hot drinks. For $11 I think it's not unreasonable to ask for a piece of recycled paper that costs less than a cent."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and love it!!

I have tried the following:
- 3 guys (tapioca, grass jelly and pudding)
- grass jelly original milk tea

As the items placed in there is quite sweet, I would recommend going with 50% sweet or less. I had both at 70% sweet and felt like I could probably go less sweet.

The only complaint I do have is with the layout of the store, as it is long, you have to order at the back of the store, but the menus are also at the back of the store, so when there is a long line up, you can't look at the menu to decide while you are waiting. They need to have the menu posted up in the front too so everyone can look and decide what they want!"}
{"text":"This bubble tea place allows you to choose your sweetness/amount of ice for each drink.  I tried their pearl milk tea with 50% sugar and less ice.  My drink was still pretty sweet (would prefer it to be less sweet) and the tapioca was really good.  The tapioca was so fresh and chewy - yum!"}
{"text":"This location is pretty small with only a few places to sit and can get really cramped near the ordering counter when there's a couple people in the store. Service is great as the staff are really nice and welcoming. I've only been to this location twice, and they've messed up on my order twice, however, they were quick to apologize and fix my drinks which is all that I can ask for.
And of course, drinks from Coco Fresh are always delicious."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night maybe like 15 mins before they closed. The service was super slow and my friend and I waited like half an hour just for bubble tea...Maybe we just came at a bad time but it took way too long. I decided to try the mango smoothie for the first time. I got 30% sugar as I do with all my drinks. They don't even use real mango, I saw them pump in mango syrup lol. This drink also contains one of those little yakult drinks, then it's just a ton of ice and like a cup of milk. Taste is like artificial mango. Ya not getting this specific drink again. My go-to for coco is usually the regular milk tea with pearls since you can't really go wrong with that (unless they mess up the tapioca or add too much water). The black tea they use is nice and strong and the drink is quite rich."}
{"text":"Ahh!!! I'm so excited for CoCo! I usually take the TTC to Eglinton for some delicious bubble tea, but now that CoCo has arrived, I can just stroll down here instead!

It's so casual and trendy inside the store, and I really dig the orange-and-brown color scheme. Everything just looks so cheerful! When you enter, upbeat pop music plays at a louder-than-average volume so that a lull in conversation will not be too noticeable. You can customize your drinks here (sugar + ice level + size), and the drinks are made quite quickly.

I find the assortment of milk teas unique and fun! It's kind of expensive, but they have an awards system going on with a rather sketchy-looking app called Vicinity. Every tenth drink you buy is free!

CoCo is full of students, and I can imagine this milk tea chain to be a frequent hang-out spot in the future. I'm so glad it's open!"}
{"text":"A good quick spot for bubble tea. It does not have a ridiculous lineup like Chatime and it's 10x better."}
{"text":"Giving them 2 stars because they have made their cups smaller and I only get one drink from here which is the lemon king. It comes with a lemon and because the cups are now more taller and slender, the lemon is stuck and I cannot suck up my toppings. The cup also doesn't fit in my car holder cup because it's not standard and now the cup just falls back and forth and so I cannot drink my drink without it spilling over. I don't understand why they changed their cups when it obviously doesn't work for all their drinks. I had to open the plastic and pull the lemon out just to eat my tapioca. I would give them a 1 star but luckily their lemon king stilll tastes good. Just maybe next time I will ask them to leave it out."}
{"text":"Love CoCo! Definitely one of the better bubble tea shops that have opened up. I love the lemon king!"}
{"text":"Quick service. Line builds up right at 12 noon as store opens. The day that I swing by also happens to be anniversary store celebration. Order one top 10 drink and receive a medium bubble tea for free.

Coco fresh tea always have monthly promo. From the poster at cashier, this month is Japanese roasted milk tea. Throughout January and February, four strawberry drinks are also on sale. 

My favourite top 10 drink is always green tea matcha milk tea with red bean. Always get the large just because medium is never enough for me!"}
{"text":"Since designated bubble tea places are scarce where I'm from, I made sure to get my fill during my trip in Toronto. CoCo happened to be next to where we were having dinner, so I wanted to stop by afterwards as a sweet treat. 

I decided to go with the iced 3 Guys Milk Tea, since it seems to be what they're known for. I thought it was delicious and super filling. Granted I did order a large with light ice, but it would definitely be filling on an empty stomach as well. My boyfriend opted for a regular blank with pudding. He seemed to like his and finished it rather quickly.

My only gripe is that they use giant spoonfuls of pudding and grass jelly, instead of cutting it up a little to make it easier to slurp up through the straw. You have to do some fancy slicing with your straw to break it up, in order to be able to drink it.

This place was actually probably one of my top favorites, in all that I've had, in terms of bubble tea. CoCo is one of the few places I've been with a close resemblance to bubble tea places in Asian countries. The atmosphere, along the variety of options they have, are very similar to those in Asia. That's a really high-end compliment coming from me. 

It was rather busy while we were there, and they were apologetic for it. I didn't mind the wait, since we weren't in any hurry. But I could tell they were dealing with some difficult customers before and after us. Props to them for handling it so well. I didn't have much interaction with the employees, but they were working hard. 

If I were ever in the area again, I'd definitely make CoCo one of my stops.

Overall: 4/5
Food: 4/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"My friend told me to check this place out a while ago and I've bookmarked it in my phone. Today, I finally made my way to CoCo to try their bubble teas for the first time. 

Service: A friendly young lady at the counter, I loved how she greeted every customer with a smile. 

The line moved slowly- there were a few people waiting with their receipts (a receipt has your order number).


Drink: I ordered matcha milk tea with 50% sugar & tapioca. I'm glad that I asked the lady at the counter before ordering since even with 50% sugar, the drink was still a bit sweet. 

I love tapioca and I have a sweet tooth- but the tapioca from here were way too sweet. It felt like I was chewing sugar balls, so by the end, it was difficult to try to finish them.

Next time, I would order another bubble tea with 30% sugar & without tapioca. 


It seems that CoCo's bubble teas are on the sweet side. I would recommend people to order their drinks with 50% or less sugar, or, with more ice!"}
{"text":"I'm one of those Asian kid who don't crave for bubble tea all the time, i mean, I do drink it but it's just not my go to drink :). However after having Coco Tea, I have been craving it for the past few weeks so this must mean something!!! 

My favorite drinks are 3 Guys cuz it's a drink with the best value! For around $5 you can get a mixture of tapioca, grass jelly and pudding (I'm cheap lol). I like the strong black tea flavor in the drink and the pudding is smooth and velvety. Good grass jelly is hard to come by these days as most places just scoop out tasteless black jello now. I'm happy to say that the grass jelly here has a mellow herbal taste to it that I love.

My other fav drink is the lemon king when I don't want milk tea as it is super refreshing, and they even put an entire lemon in the drink! I recommend getting it half sweet so you will be able to taste the slight sourness from the lemon."}
{"text":"I always order Green Tea Yakult awwww its's always the best!! It's the healthiest as well!! Unlike other bubble tea stores use yogurt syrup for yogurt green tea,  Coco uses real Yakult to make yogurt green tea and they usually put 2 bottles of Yakult into the drink!! whoohooo!!I always ask for 30% sugar, since Yakult is already sweet. I love the way how Yakult and green blend with each other and create a fantastic taste together!"}
{"text":"Yum!  I got a coupon for this place so I checked it out yesterday.  Taro is one of my usual flavours, but it was my first time having sago pearls, and it was so good!  If you're not crazy about the traditional tapioca, you will like sago so much more.

In my time, the best places I've found to get bubble tea are indie shops, but for a chain, this place is still really good."}
{"text":"For the largest bubble tea company in the world, I expect more. The New York location I've been to was way better than this place. That being said, the product and the product quality was consistent. I'm just not a big fan of their offerings here in Toronto, very little in comparison to the NYC location. 

The service and the staff were great and informed me of other offerings they had.

I did enjoy my visit here, and I'll definitely stop by again. I just left with the feeling that it was missing something in the process."}
{"text":"Today I enjoyed a well-steeped, plain milk pearl tea, no sugar.

The tea has a deep taste.  Boba has the perfect amount of chewiness - and not too sweet, just right.  Texture is bang on.  Love.

Mmm mmm!"}
{"text":"Personally didn't enjoy the taste too much. It was way too overwhelming in sweetness n had a weird coconut taste."}
{"text":"Good deals of the month. Fresh tea, and chewy toppings. Mango yakult, green tea yakult are quite refreshing. Along with the lemon King! 

their popular 2 lady's and 3 guys, are OK.. But it's become my new bbt spot to go to downtown."}
{"text":"Went for the buy 1 get one free.

I got the Lemon Yakult, Less Ice and 30% Sugar. It wasn't too sweet or sour. I think the lemon complemented the yakult. Yakult is an asian yogurt drink that's good to drink after dinner for digestion. 

We got a milk tea pearl bubble tea as the free drink. I had a sip and it was decent. The pearl was better than general places. 

Great deal and would check this place out again for other flavours. The staff was very friendly so thumbs up for that!"}
{"text":"I got the lady Gaga but was a bit disappointed because the same drink I had from Coco in Taiwan had real passion fruit in the drink which was my favorite part and the drink I had here was just passion fruit syrup. Don't get me wrong it is still an incredibly refreshing and delicious drink I prefer over most desserts. Maybe it is a seasonal item but I'm definitely asking next time I go!"}
{"text":"Bought the pearl milk tea (#1) and I thought the Coco on finch was better, the drink tasted a bit watery for me even though I asked for less ice. Tapioca was delicious, I still enjoyed it though!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the drink and 3 stars for service. I like the milk tea from here more than any other places in the area. It tends to stay on sweeter milk side so I hope it could add more tea in it. The price is fair and comparable with other bubble tea chain. I always came here for milk tea for the milk tea instead of any other drinks because other drinks seem that it contains too much sugar in it.

Overall, I totally recommend this place, especially for milk tea."}
{"text":"Sometimes I feel like craving to fiveguys. Passion fruit with pearl topping is also amazing. Yummy !"}
{"text":"This is my favourite bubble tea chain in Toronto. I like to quickly stop by when there are no lineups, which unfortunately happens a lot. OPEN MORE CASH REGISTERS!

my favourite thing about this chain is that the tapioca is always lightly sweet and incredibly chewy throughout. completely unlike cheap chinese $2 imitations. Also, the tea itself is loaded with flavour.

my recommendations:
-3 Guys no ice 50% sugar (it's a pudding, jelly, and tapioca milk tea)
-taro bubble tea no ice 50% sugar (damn fine flavour)"}
{"text":"As you enter the store, you will notice the bright orange signs with Lady Gaga playlist. CoCo Fresh Juice & Tea is cheery and upbeat! 

There is usually a deal of a month where you can get a large drink for $3.88. Currently, the drink is 2 Lady (tapioca, pudding and milk tea). It is likely the best bubble tea store in downtown. Tapioca is fresh almost every hour, on the hour. It's chewy, the way tapioca should be. 

Drinks comes in 0%, 30%, 50% and 100% sugar, as with ice. My go-to drink is Milk Tea with 0% sugar and no ice. Since the tapioca is already soaked in sugar syrup, I find it has enough sweetness for my palate. It's a great balance between the creaminess of the milk and acidic black tea. My only concern (as with many typical bubble tea store) is that the milk is derived from powdered creamer."}
{"text":"It has been at least a month since I had bubbletea and I saw this CoCo location while walking to dinner. I had some time to kill, so I decided to drop in. The interior was pretty nice with seating for about 4 groups and 2 stools at the front. I ordered a grass jelly milk tea, which turned out to be on sale for the month of December! Although I ordered it with less sugar (30%), I thought it was still too syrupy. I think that Chatime's version of the grass jelly milk tea is far better.

There's free wifi at this location. The password is the location's phone number. However, I could not browse Yelp on my phone. Boo!

There are 2 bathrooms on the lower level. Two-ply, soft toilet paper. Nice!"}
{"text":"Nice staff, fast service, and good bbt. I'm a strong advocate of chatime, but this is way up there too. I ordered the 3 guys and I am not disappointed! I do like that I can use my vicinity card here :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bubble tea places. The quality is always consistent throughout the multiple chains in Toronto. I always order the Bubble Gaga since it has tapioca and coconut jelly in a passionfruit green tea. A large is $4.7 which is consider cheaper than most other bubble places where you need to get the toppings separate. Their 2 ladies is also very good and has a nice milk tea flavour. The service is always amazing and then make the drinks very fast!"}
{"text":"Now this place is at must to try, they got different flavours, very refreshing and very well packed to take home.  It is a very busy place but staff can get your order in 5 min so it's not a long wait."}
{"text":"This is a really great place for bubble tea! I've tried the pearl milk tea and matcha latte. Both were tasty. With sugar though, their regular is usually too sweet so I go with the 30% sugar.

The place isn't too big, but it seats around 15 people, and is usually crowded on weekends and weeknights.

They also have a loyalty program, where every 10 points gets you a free drink!"}
{"text":"The lure of getting a buy one get one free bubble tea was too great, so i gave in.  As expected, there was a line up into the street.  It took about 10 to 15 minutes to get to the counter to order our tea, and another 15 minutes wait to get them.  The area (near the counter) where we stood to wait for our tea was super crowded.  There weren't really other options because we had to be there to hear our orders being called out, and the girl calling out the order numbers, was quiet.
I had the regular milk tea with tapioca.  It was good and filling.  My friend ordered matcha green tea with red beans, and she liked hers.
I think today is the last day for this promotion.  Am tempted to go back again lol."}
{"text":"Love this place since it's very close to my work place! I usually come here once a week. The workers here are very nice! 

My favourite drink to get is the Bubble Gaga, which consists of passion fruit green tea, coconut jelly, and tapioca. Yum! I also get it with 0% sugar since the passion fruit syrup itself is sweet (I'm also not much of a sweet person ;))!

The price and quality of the drink (to me) is much better than other bubble tea places that I've tried. The bubbles are cooked just right! I think this is the best tapioca place I've tried - they also have a coat of sugar.. which make them less plain! Hence, get less sugar in your drink. They usually have monthly specials - large for $3.80. 

The reason why I'm giving it a 4* instead of a 5* is because I had a bad incident with one of their drinks. They had a special, which was their black tea latte. Black tea latte is literally 3/4 fresh milk, and 1/4 black tea. Much like a milk tea but... mostly milk! I guess the day I got it... the milk was not fresh - it tasted very off. 

Also, much like other places, I do not think they pay attention to the sugar levels if you ask for 30%, 50% or 70%. It's more like 100% or 0%. 

Anywho, I will not let one bad drink ruin my love for coco :)"}
{"text":"Very tasty bubble tea! The cashier is very friendly! I like the pearl milk tea, lemon yakult and strawberry latte."}
{"text":"I'm so happy Coco is now open downtown Toronto. I've tried their drinks a couple times and everytime I ordered something different cuz I want try all the selections they have in the top 10 list. 4 down and 6 more to go! Can't wait for my next visit to Coco! Btw, all 4 of the drinks I had were XXXcellent!"}
