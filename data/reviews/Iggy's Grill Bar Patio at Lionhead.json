{"text":"I had a fantastic burger with fries here. I Would definitely recommend the jalapeño burger. The service is fast, friendly and the scenery of the golf club is great!"}

Definitely will go back"}
{"text":"Dinner on a Friday night with the family, restaurant was fairly quiet (max 3 other tables). Waiters were friendly, service was good. Ordered steak sandwich with side Caesar salad, and would give the sandwich a B- but the salad an A. Steak sandwich would have been better if the bun had been toasted first. Sampled some fries, which were pretty fantastic for restaurant fries, although quite salty. Dessert and coffee at end of meal took forever to arrive (20 minutes). May give them another shot (Wednesday tapas night perhaps?) so hard to find a decent place in the Brampton area."}
{"text":"Very, VERY impressed with this place. I should've taken some pics, but I can assure that the pics presently on the site (at the time of writing), including the owner's photos, are fully accurate in depicting the presentation and quality of the food.

First off, if you couldn't tell already, it's situated at a golf course. About the only issue I had was a minor one, as you're directed to walk to the side and around to main building to get to it, but there's no path. You have to walk on the road briefly which can be a bit confusing on your first visit.

We came mid-day on a Sunday when they have a brunch menu. Some great brunch features, including a $36 option which serves 4 and has the favourites of toast, bacon, egg, sausage, and home fries. A helpful option they do with that is simply adding about $10 for each additional person. Naturally there's omelettes, benny's etc...

I had already eaten breakfast so I went with the jalapeño burger. Again, I really should've taken a pic as it was perfectly served, and even had a popper on top. A very large patty made with quality meat, and still had some very slight pink in the middle which I was was happy with. Love the pickled jalapeños and onions, and the veggies were perfectly fresh. Good side of fresh-cut fries.

My wife went with the California salad, which included walnuts, orange, strawberries and half an avocado. Without exaggerating, it was the best presentation of a salad in this price range I've seen by far. It was served with a mini wooden spoon and fork and a side mini mason jar of citrus dressing. I also can't overstate how perfectly fresh and ripe each component was, with nothing being slightly wilted or unripened.

Oddly, I was almost the most impressed by the kids menu. At first it seems like a pretty high price point for kids with most things starting at $11. However, the waitress said one pizza would be more than enough, and I kid you not (no pun intended) that it was a 10\" pizza. Very good quality and the cheese had a nice, slightly aged (but not too much) quality to it. They both received drink and for dessert went with funnel cake fries. It was essentially funnel cake, but just portioned in a way that they were in the shape of fries, and served in a mini fry basket with icing sugar and a side of chocolate sauce. $11 very well spent I'd say.

For this price point, with most items on the menu being under $20, it's fully deserving of a 5. It's easy to say that this is a must try for anyone in Brampton, and given its location, people in areas such as Meadowvale and Streetsville can make it here in 15-20 minutes too and should certainly give Iggy's a try."}
{"text":"Booked a reservation online for Father's Day lunch. After a few hours an individual called from the restaurant to tell me they don't accept reservations on Sundays and to not even bother showing up as it's their busiest day of the year. Was a little thrown back at how quick they were to turn me down and say not show up at all. If you do plan on visiting the restaurant I would suggest calling the restaurant directly to avoid and mishaps"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. My girlfriend and I were the only ones there so service was quick. I got the spaghetti and my gf got the turkey burger and a Caesar salad as her side. My spaghetti was good and meatballs are made fresh in house. My gf's salad was huge and the presentation was adorable! They give the dressing on the side in a little mason jar with a wooden spoon and fork to toss the salad yourself. Her burger looked delicious and she said it was pretty good. I think next time I'll try the turkey burger. Venue is lovely and the patio must be beautiful in the summer. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Sunday. The service was amazing. Our server was so friendly and tentative and directed us to food to our liking. I had pizza (can't rem the name of it now but not the margarita one) and I requested the meet on the side as I didn't want it on the pizza and there was no issue with that. This was actually the best pizza I ever had (no lie). My boyfriend had eggs and home fry potatoes and let me tell you the home fries were delicious. We were looking at the dessert menu and nothing really appealed to us much since im allergic to fruit but the waitress really pushed us to have to custurd pudding dessert with caramel sauce (i don't even know if that's what it was) but it was so cinnamon-y, sweet and good! Check out the pics if you want to try it out."}
{"text":"Delicious hamburgers are just the beginning at Iggy's restaurant at Lionhead golf course on Mississauga rd. The chef is very advanced in the art of making delicious entrees and he makes the meal look spectacular in the plate. I was impressed with creativity in the spinach salad - some fruit, nuts and red peppers are to be expected for sure but half an avocado ? and the tangy raspberry flavoured salad dressing on the side in a little mason jar - cute and effective. The burger was delicious cooked perfectly on a crisp yet fresh bun. On a nice day they cook outside at an outdoor kitchen - they have a terrific patio that's right beside a practice green which provides endless entertainment for the diners. Its a good set up and good food all around."}
