{"text":"Great experience. The ambiance was great and the music selection really complimented the vibe of the restaurant. We had a number of bites and the octopus appetizer before sharing the skirt steak, pork chops, and short ribs. Everything was cooked perfectly, including the octopus (which in a lot of restaurants there is a chance it will be overcooked and rubbery). Our server Melissa took care of our table and made sure that our wine and water glasses were never empty. I definitely plan on returning the next time I'm in Toronto, and would recommend Branca to all of my friends."}
{"text":"The food, cocktails and ambience were all outstanding. Service was good - our server took some time to warm up, but was professional and fine. The hostess and bartender were both really lovely and took time to make us feel well taken care of when we were waiting for our table.  Two of us shared the grilled romaine starter (which we loved), the pulpo (perfect) and the skirt steak (amazing) with a side of fries and the green salad. Sides were fine, but the stand-outs were the meats. We waited a bit for our main to come out  - if we had been in a rush it might have felt like too much, but we weren't and were happy to chat and have another cocktail. We were too stuffed to try a dessert, but the couple next to us got the panqueques and they looked great. The ambience is cosy and warm and loved that they had Aesop soap in the bathroom! Overall a fantastic dining experience."}
{"text":"Best steak I've had in Toronto at a fair price. I would recommend this restaurant for a date. If you have to come in a group - max. 4 people. Everything was delicious from the cocktails to the meat dishes, sides and dessert. Two of us made a reservation here on a Thursday night.  Cocktails: 4.5/5 - had the Pisco Sour and Earl Grey Cobler which were both good  Food: 4.5/5 - To start, we had Empanadas and Mollejas (sweet breads). Although both appetizers were small, they were quite heavy. They were both tasty but I preferred the empanadas over the mollejas. - Main dishes: Entrana (Skirt Steak) and Beef Short Rib - both were so tender and tasty. I highly recommend either dish, but if you prefer a fattier piece of meat, I recommend the short rib and if you prefer leaner, then the skirt steak. - Sides: I recommend the Crispy Potato Strings. We also had Caramelized Endives which were OK. We didn't really need 2 sides between the 2 of us (especially because there were enough potato strings for 2), but next time I would try the Roasted Cremini. -Dessert: Panqueques (crepes with dulce de leche) - recommended by our server and it was the perfect last bite to our meal.  Service: 5/5 - service was knowledgeable, friendly, attentive, and pleasant.  It's a small, intimate place. Some people were casual and others dressed up a bit more, but not formal at all. I highly recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"We went for a spontaneous anniversary dinner--reservations required. We were greeted by a friendly young woman and immediately seated. The restaurant is very, very cosy . Menu and suggestions of amount were very helpful. We ordered empanadas and the romaine salad to start --both were delicious but the orange vinaigrette on the salad was fantastic! Then we had the roast chicken --1/2 a chicken cooked exceptionally  well, and the steak was one of the best my husband had. Sides were outstanding too including the burnt carrots and the caramelized  endive. Everything was so authentic , flavourful and beautifully presented . We even sampled the lemon tart that was super  tangy . Overall an excellent meal!! . It's a bit small and the place was full. We were told they are enclosing they're patio to allow for more seating --great idea as it will be very popular."}
{"text":"Above average joint, some truly unique offerings but a few operational issues.   Came in for an 8.30 Friday night dinner -   The Great - Service: these folks are a rarity amongst their peers - courteous, hospitable and helpful. They look you in the eye, they're not awkward, they smile, they seem genuinely happy that you are dining with them, they're not brusque/\"too cool for school\" and they cheerfully offer a thorough but non-rambling overview when explaining the two asado prep styles for the uninitiated. Waiter + hostess both top-notch. Chapeau.  - Amuse: Branca's ode to Argentinian street food. Their riff on chip√° is a delightfully fluffy and buttery pocket of dough filled with cheddar. Wish there was more cheddar. Wish we could have more then two, could have easily put away a basket of these suckers. Heaven.  - Sepia: smoked cuttlefish app is perfection. Gives the infamous grilled octopus at Bar Isabel a run for its money in the cephalopod department. Great smoky flavor throughout, texture/hardness is just right, obviously skillfully prepared.  - Scampi: good size (roughly 4 fingers knuckle-to-joint), Icelandic origin offers comfort to those wary of faux-scampi from Asia but is a questionable value proposition at $34/four.   - Harissa sauce: small pot is deceiving, $1 buys a lot of sauce here. Nice mulchy texture, heat gathers rapidly and stays hot enough to make it interesting if you employ eyeball-sized chunks at a time. Not just \"white people hot\", this thing had a real nip to it. - Wine: Despite its Argentinian heritage, Branca's wine list is regionally diverse and well thought out. Snobbish oenophiles who are loathe to consume New World will be glad to know that Old World is over-represented and that the wine program has made some very clever choices from France, Italy and Spain. Also enjoyed a bone-dry, light, and capital E excellent value cava.  - Panqueques: three rolled crepes, each roughly the size of a gordo cigar, moderately spread with dulce de leche - this is the type of dessert you're still thinking about two or three days later. Only wish that the insides were FILLED with dulce de leche instead of the light-handed approach Branca is currently taking. Accompanied with a generous dollop of some curiously flavorless (did someone forget the vanilla bean paste?) and unsweet chantilly cream. This dessert is great but has the potential to be life-ruiningly decadent if only Branca was amenable to some tweaking.   - Interior: shout out to the whimsical flamingo bathroom wallpaper, wallpaper game on fleek. Fake Calcutta marble table game not as strong. Herringbone floor, unexpected and exquisite. Please adjust the lighting to better show off your luscious banquettes, the green is to die for.   The Average - Cocktails: online version won't necessarily tie to what you see day-of - Entrana: middle of the pack skirt steak, portion smaller then expected, nothing notable flavor-wise on a stand-alone basis, recommend ordering many sorts of their $1 sauce pots and to dab liberally  - Chimichurri: lacks flavor, thin and watery, dry ingredients not well-incorporated into the oil and vinegar leaving you with a mess of liquid pooling in the pot, inferior to Bar Isabel's - Collards: If your momma is like my momma and made collards the old-fashioned way with fat back, ham hocks, bacon drippings and neck bones, then Branca's version just won't do. Skip it.  - Golden Dome: this dessert is more about looks (some artfully plated petals and gold flakes and impressive enough that it will almost remind you of the time you saw Dome of the Rock during Taglit) then chocolaty deliciousness. Skip it.   The Heinous - This place turns into a madhouse close to 10PM when late night eaters/drinkers arrive. The interior is rectangular and tables are positioned lengthwise with a runway bisecting the restaurant for the staff. This leaves a modest amount of square footage at the front of the house to corral folks waiting for a table and most seem to lack the self-direction to gather around the bar and tend to cluster in heaps around the hostess stand. Unfortunately, diners seated on the banquettes lining the walls are then treated to a show of 12-15 folks frowning, hostile and accusatory glaring, aggressive rolling of the eyes, enough sulking to rival a besmirched tween girl, sharing one glass of cava among three, squatting on the ground like common vagrants, etc etc. Extremely repulsive to have to look at this cattle-like spectacle and detracts immensely from a dining room that otherwise maintains an overall sense of order and decorum. Branca needs to revisit their process design and must learn how to decouple these groups and create queue buffers along the bar or better yet, make them wait outside if they can't act like people."}
{"text":"Tried Branca out for dinner as I saw that it had just opened in my neighbourhood.   They do a sharing style menu which i love. The apps were delicious but more of a fusion than traditional argentine. The meats however are all very traditional and tasty! The only thing was that they did not ask how we wanted the meat done, so it was a little more cooked than we prefer. We had the flan and the panqueques for dessert and both were amazing. Overall the food was a major win!   Drink selection was not bad, only 2 beers on tap though and no bottles (but i think they will be getting more) and a decent wine and cocktail selection.   It's a very small place but has a nice vibe and atmosphere to it. Casual and classy at the same time. Service was also very good!  The bill was around 100 for 2 people and we had all courses and drinks, good value for the overall experience.  I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"The quality of the meat for the price was not worth it. We weren't impressed with anything in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Our favorite dishes were the lamb chops, empanadas, potato strings, roasted cremini and the dulce de leche crepe!  Also the cocktails were spot on.  Great little place and would go back!"}
{"text":"Great service from the hostess, bartender and waiter. My friend and I have been trying to get together for a catch up and this ended up being the perfect place. Great wine list, food and atmosphere. We started with the the salad and house made sausage,  and then skirt steak, short ribs plus fries..all amazing and delicious. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Steaks arrived cold. Staffs were very friendly but always MIA as we were dining inside. Was very tempted to leave 5% tip but ended up leaving 15%. Overall food was meh. My in-law cooks better asado in his back yard. Definitely not worth the price nor the drive."}
{"text":"An Argentinian BBQ joint near my 'hood? Yes PLEASE. The food and drinks are delicious. Some highlights: - the octopus (\"pulpo\"!)  - the skirt steak  - the short rib - the baby kale salad - THE CONDIMENTS  - the Caipirinha and the Bastard cocktails - just try them. The space is beautiful, from the neon pink sign to the gold ceiling to the green velvet banquettes to the mural of the ladies & the cowboy (the ladies are enough of a draw on their own).  Despite the sophistication of the menu + space, the staff are incredibly friendly (ask them for a tour of the \"casa del fuego\"), knowledgeable and fun.  I had an amazing time and plan to go back this week."}
{"text":"So glad I tried this place. Atmosphere has great ambiance and love that the place is small. I came here on Friday night and got seated promptly. Ordered the Lagostina (Shrimp) appetizer and it was amazing, shrimp was cooked perfectly. Got the beef ribs and skirt steak to follow and got all 4 sauces as recommended by our server. Left very full and satisfied - looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Delicious food and very cozy atmosphere. Went there last night for a bday dinner and we loved the veggie empanadas and all the proteins we had. The chicken was outstanding, it was smoked before it was roasted.  The Tomahawk was juicy and so big that it easily feeds a family."}
{"text":"Steak and frites were fire!!! And the homemade ricotta was from a magical dream cloud! The octopus was up there with some of the best I've had in the world and the empanadas were the perfect texture combined with scrumptious juiciness. The patio backed onto some construction that felt like you were entering a cool post apocalyptic garden that is temporary but really worked. The open patio kitchen added super fun flames and subtle el fresco enchantment. If you haven't been yet you're actually not living your best life."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 arrived on a Wednesday evening 12/07/16 for a birthday celebration. Immediately on entering the homey front entrance, we knew we were going to be in for a treat! A small but well stocked bar is stationed up front with smiling welcoming staff. The best part being they had several varieties of true bourbon on the shelf which I drink regularly!! Staff  took our coats and showed us directly to our table without any delay. I can honestly say that evening we tried almost everything on the menu which was a culinary wonderland. Here's what we ate:  Wild Mushroom Empanadas Grilled Romaine Pulpo  Tomahawk Brussel Sprouts Burnt Eggplant Potato Strings Panqueques Parmesan Poundcake  Do order the empanadas - they were crispy, light and with a flavor that lingers! Who knew you could cook lettuce? Try it, then do it at home! You won't regret it. (Good dining should introduce you to new experiences and this was for me). Pulpo is grilled octopus which was probably the best I've ever had - tender, flavourful and not one bite was rubbery! The tomahawk is steak like none other. This piece was the size of a racket! it was prepared just right!  I could go on and on... Go to this restaurant. Make friends with the staff. They will take care of you, feed you with style and make delicious memories for you!  P.S. Try the amare after dinner!"}
{"text":"What an awesome little spot!! Cocktails, delicious! Steak, perfect! Staff, so friendly and generous. And pricing is totally reasonable too. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Honestly we had pretty high expectations based on the reviews and the pics from the reviews.  We ordered the grilled octopus and beets and barreta for apps and skirt steak, short rib and Austrailian wagu for the mains accompanied with the fries and endives ending with the crepe for dessert.  Everyone ravs that the grilled octopus is amazing and to die for. I would say that it was good. Im not sure the yogurt with the octopus is a good match. As for the beets and barreta, the beets were delicious but being paired with the barreta made it bland.   For the mains, all of the meats kind of tasted the same. They were tender but if I were to be honest, they were heavily salted. Yes it was good but I've had better cuts of meat at other steakhouses, heck even the Keg filet was tastier. The oil in their fryer should be changed because and underneath the first layer of fries all you had left was tiny bits of fries which was pretty tacky. The endives were sweet and more watery in balsamic then caramelized.  The crepe dessert was pretty good. The crepe was kind of rubbery but the dulce de leche, chantilly lace and a touch of salt worked well together.  Overall I would say this place is standard, I wouldnt go back and I think the way they pair their ingredients is almost like they're pairing it together for the sake of being different as opposed to the pairing being a ingenuis idea. The flavour profiles just dont work.  I say pass unless you'd like to experience it for yourself but you've been warned."}
{"text":"Had birthday dinner with the fam tonight and it was wonderful. The staff were super accommodating especially considering we had our two year old with us. The food is outstanding and perfect for sharing. We had empanadas, yellowtail and an ancient grain salad to start. Then shared short rib, skirt steak and chicken with fries and asparagus. Truly delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner here.  Had decided only in the afternoon that we wanted to come here for dinner, but was still able to book a reservation for 2 online.  There were still a couple of tables free when we got seated, but it filled up quickly.  There was a wait at the door by the time we were done.  We ordered the grilled romaine ($14) and housemade ricotta ($16) as starters.  I've had charred cabbage at a restaurant before, so was intrigued about the taste of grilled romaine.  Equally delicious - I will definitely have to give this a try when I BBQ at home next time!  We found the housemade ricotta a little salty, and would likely forego this choice in future.  We were also given complimentary yucca cheese balls - they're like the texture of yorkshire pudding...a nice treat!  In fact, if they were on the menu, I might have ordered some more!  For our mains, we ordered the 8oz skirt steak ($24) and the beef short rib ($27), with a side of grilled asparagus ($8).  We asked for the skirt steak to be rare, and indeed that's what we got.  We always appreciate a restaurant meeting our \"rare\" request;  so many overcook our meats!  The meats were tasty and came with dips, although truly they were not needed.  We loved tasting the natural grilled flavour on the steak and ribs.  We saw many tables ordering the crispy potato strings as a side, but we were worried we'd get too filled up.  Maybe next time!  In fact, next time may call for the Tomahawk rib-eye.  Because our dinner was relatively early (630pm), we were a little hungry by late night.    Dinner with 2 glasses of wine came to $130 before tip.  Service was friendly yet professional.  We didn't order dessert, but our bill came with two tiny dulce de leche filled shortbread cookies!  A perfect way to end the meal."}
{"text":"Took my wife out for dinner. Great food, atmosphere. Best part is that we were not rushed at all, it felt like an old world dinner (in the best way possible). We were very pleased with the overall experience and will come back on a special occasion.  Our mains included the flank steak and lamb, both of which were very tasty and well done. Good choice of wines too."}
{"text":"Good spot if you're in the area. Went with a group of 5 and everything we quite tasty from the appetizers to the desert (dessert was maybe even the highlight). We didn't spring for the big ribeye, but would have said our skirt steak was the least impressive of the meats we got, but chicken and lamb were top notch.   My only complaint was the portion size. Everything was smaller that I thought, especially the sides. We ordered a side of asparagus and got 5 spears, so one each. We order a side of mushrooms and had to cut 4 mushrooms into 5 portions. They could have done a better job at guiding us with this, but otherwise would recommend the place."}
{"text":"There is street parking right outside the restaurant (I think $1.50 per hour...?) so, it was very convenient.  The place is quite cozy (small and intimate) so, would recommend making reservations during peak hours to ensure seating. The waiting staff was very pleasant and attentive (wipes the crumbs off your table after every course...ensures that your drinks are filled).   The general recommendation is to order an appetizer, main and side per person and I found this to be more than enough food. Left feeling very satiated but not grossly filled (e.g. japanese buffet level filled).  Appetizer Sweetbreads - 3.5/5 (this was ok...prefer the sweetbreads from Black Hoof) Blood sausage - 3.5/5 (was a tad salty and the portion was so tiny...a more accurate description would be a \"SLICE of blood sausage\"...would not recommend this one)  Main 1/2 Chicken - 4/5 (skin was crispy and I think it was cooked over a charcoal grill...very flavourful and moist...generous portion...looked like a baby pterodactyl) Short ribs - 5/5 (very generous portion...stripped the meat off the bone...best part of the meal IMO)  Sides Carrots - 4/5 (sweet,garnished with fried herbs) Greens - 4/5 (had a creamy orange balsamic dressing that was very \"fresh\")"}
{"text":"Love their menu, service is always great! Can't wait to try their patio this summer:)"}
{"text":"This place is something different in Toronto and absolutely delicious.  Waiters were very attentive and friendly.  Ordered 2 sides and 3 mains for two people and had some left overs to go.  Atmosphere is cozy and romantic."}
{"text":"Came to Branca to celebrate my birthday. I was surprised  how small the restaurant was. I expected to find an open concept kitchen in the back with lots of meats over the fire, instead we found a very sophisticated minimalistic room. Being from Peru I can not resist any Pisco based drink so of course I ordered myself a Pisco sour to start things of.  For appies we had the Langostinos (shrimp) and Mollejas ( sweet breads) these were both delicious but I have to  say the portions are small here.   For my main I had the beef short rib, this  was my favorite  part of my meal, it was cooked to perfection and I'm so glad I ordered the chimichurri to go with it. We also had a side of mushrooms that complemented the meat very well. I had a small taste of the lamb rack. If you ask me the short rib is far superior.  Overall great experience only thing that I though was a bit strange is that I didn't find many Argentinian reds on their wine list. I love me some Malbecs but wasn't able to find any on their list."}
{"text":"Excellent on all fronts. The cocktails were on point. The food was amazing; we had the choripan and the prawns as appetizers. The skirt stake and Cornish hen as mains, which were sublime. All recommended. The chimichurri is like something you would find at the best places in Argentina. The wine selection is perfect and somewhat affordable. Our waiter was friendly and professional. Great place to eat al fresco in an intimate setting. Overall, the food is slightly overpriced and the place is too off the beaten path if you're not feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"We had the Tostada appetizer which was good.  From there it went downhill. Service was extremely slow for a Wednesday evening. The skirt steak was well prepared, but was not anywhere near the 8 oz as advertized. The lamb scewer was ok. , But not exceptional.  With one glass of wine the bill came to just under $100 both of us felt the value for the money was just not there.  Both of us left feeling hungry and disappointed. Not a place I would visit again"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. What a hidden gem! Must try the flank steak and frites. Sipped on  South American vinos that were well balanced and suited the meal."}
{"text":"Food, ambiance, service, decor - all a major hit!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night.  The customer service was exceptional prior to me even getting to the restaurant.  I tried to make a reservation online, however there were no seating times that could accommodate my request for 7PM.  So I called and spoke with someone there and she mentioned she would call me the day of to let me know whether or not the patio was open and if it was, I would most certainly be able to reserve for 7PM.  Sure enough she called me back Friday morning and let me know that I would be able to come in for 7PM.  The food was great.  We had the skirt steak and cornish hen.  The chimichurri sauce was excellent.  The Harissa sauce could have been spicer (but it is made in house so that's a plus).  The potato shoe strings are a must try!  And the crepes are absolutely fantastic - so glad we ended up ordering them.  This place is amazing and I will definitely be back. Friendly wait staff, relaxed vibe, amazing food."}
{"text":"Overrall experience was good.   Branca was pleasant. When we had to enlarge our party size days prior to the dinner, they accomodated.  Our reservation was at 9 p.m. We arrived at 9:20 p.m. Still our reservation was not ready until 9:50 p.m. Branca apologized and gave us a free glass of champagne on the house, which was nice.   They ran out of short ribs and lamb. We all ended up getting steak (which was phenomenal). The roasted garlic condiment was lovely. The curly fries are good (ask for hot sauce on the side).   The flan as dessert was great.   But service was a bit slow. We were seated at 9:50 but didn't get water till 10:10 p.m. We were all dehydrated.  The dinner was for a bday celebration - so they accomodated with dessert.  Overall, I had a great time but service was a bit slow.  I would go back but maybe a weekday not a weekend."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a nice taste of Argentina in the Parkdale area.   The place is pretty small and convivial which makes a great private dinner or date.   We arrived pretty late and they were still serving food which we gladly appreciated.  The food was excellent and the wine too.  Try the Argentinian steak with all the sauces/dips! So good!"}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING!!!!!!! The lamb was so tender and flavourful - cooked perfect! it was the best lamb i've ever had. We also ordered the pig and the chicken and both were also perfect. The service was amazing, the drinks were great. I left a very full and happy person. HIGHLY recommended and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Solid dinner for my wife's birthday. We sat outside since it was such a nice evening. The service was pretty good, but a little weird the server wouldn't let us put in our app order first. Something about needing to keep everything on one paper on a busy night. Anyhow, we started with the empanadas and they were delicious, albeit small.  Next came the skirt steak, which was good, but not the best steak I've had. The beef short rib was very good. For sides, we went with the potato strings and sunchokes. The potato string order was HUGE! The sunchokes were good, but I saw many people order the asparagus and I wish we ordered that. They also brought out a lovely dessert since there was a birthday. It had a candle in it and we devoured it! Overall I thought the servings were big other than the empanadas. We couldn't finish the potato strings and took half the order home. We left stuffed and satisfied."}
{"text":"Went to Branca last night with a friend, was there on her recommendation never heard of the place before but she said the reviews were good.  Menu was very promising, atmosphere on the intimate side and service was friendly and helpful.  Sides were great, burnt carrots and shoestring fries with some amazing dips.   They also had a crab sandwich starter which was pretty good.  The disappointment came with the mains.   We got the beef ribs which were bland and somewhat dry,  we also got the lamb shank which had a nice sauce but the lamb was dry and boring.  Would have been a decent meal if not for the price point.    Try once if you have cash to burn."}
{"text":"So unless we wanted to have dinner at 5pm they couldnt save us a table. So we took our chances at 7.30pm and just turned up. They sat us at the bar, where we had a waitor (the bartender) all night to ourselves. He was always attentive and helpful. Branca was recommended to me by a friend in the food and beverage and wine industry. He was right! This argentinian restaurant gets the tenderness of all their meats down to a T. There were some light fresh options on the menu to break up the heavy amount of meats available. The beet salad was amazing! We also had the skirt steak, the pork... The flavours were so interesting, it was like opening presents eating it. Each bite was a suprise. i believe the pork was the special of the night. Unfortunately this is not something you can eat every night, it was so tasty, the seasoning and cooking times are spot on. But all that delicious meat knocked me out. I was sooo tired by 10pm, normally i can stay out till midnight with a few more drinks. But the heavy meat in my stomach made me want to curl up and sleep it off....   Not as much as Barque though! That place was far too much meat, no sophistication in its cooking of it either. No light options. It was more like an all-you-can-eat sports bar. I left there underwhelmed, tired, full to the point of pain with my jeans undone.  Branca does their meat very well, and has multi layered seasonings.... Im just confused as to why they have no argentinian wine on the menu....?"}
{"text":"Branca is a beautiful little restaurant...and it was quite unassuming. Situated in a little house, in a somewhat random areas, this 8-12 table restaurant has a lot to offer.   The ambience is what I may describe as hipster chic (I could also be completely wrong with that description). Funky music, gorgeous bar, neon light sign out the front window, comfortable big benches.   The food was quite unique and delicious. Everything is meant to be shared and or waitress had some great recommendations (and was dead on with how much we should be ordering for four people). The flavours were amazing and everything was yummy. There wasn't one thing I didn't enjoy (but if i had to pass on something it would probably be the empanadas).   The skirt steak was out of this world!!! So tender and juicy. The \"burnt carrots\" we're awesome...the goat cheese complimented that dish extremely well.   This place had a great vibe and I would definitely return and recommend it to friends. It was the perfect place to go with my family of four for my birthday."}
{"text":"Went to Branca on a Saturday night. Book a reservation here as it was very busy.   We loved everything: The ambience, the service, the food!  We had:   Starter: Wild mushroom empanadas - 5/5 YUMMY  Mains: Grilled marinated Lamb skewer- 5/5   Asado de tira - 4/5 could have been a bit more seasoned, but was a surprisingly large partion.   Sides: Brussels sprouts 5/5   Crispy potato- 5/5   Desert - Panquekes - 4/4 (we would have loved some ice cream with these, but they very very good.)  I would definitely return to Branca and highly recommend it for a party of 2-4."}
{"text":"I've been waiting a while to try Branca.  Who doesn't like Argentine BBQ?  I left impressed.  The restaurant is cozy inside.  Your butt will rub on someone else's table when squeezing in and out.  The cocktails were nice.  Pisco sour is authentic.  I had a tequila based one which was a tad on the limey side for me.  Mind you, I like cocktails that have more of a bite.  Center stage was the BBQ.  Started off the the sweet breads and Argentinian shrimp - delicious.  The sweet breads almost tastes like popcorn chicken.   You would not know you're eating the less desirable organs.  For meat we went with the rack of lamb and beef short rib.  They were both amazing.  Ridiculously flavourful and even better with the chimichurri.  The poblano remesco sauce is a great 2nd option.  In hindsight, I probably would have went with the skirt steak instead of the lamb, which was about half the price, but looked great on the table beside me. The roasted cremini was also a great choice for a side.  My only small complaint is that the price was a little steep for the amount of meat you're getting.  Other than that, this is a great change from all the southern BBQ hype in the past few years."}
{"text":"Small and quaint location. Inside seemed a little dark, so good for a romantic spot. The menu is small but had some options for everyone.  I ordered the Asado de Tira which is the short ribs. It was beautifully prepared; not charred whatsoever, the meat was very soft, which is great. The portion was normal.  I ordered a side of the Crispy Potato Strings which was also a good portion and came out nice and crispy.  I tried two of the three sauces served: Chimichurri and the salsa de tomate - a little too much on the oily side, but still a great addition to my dinner.  I did not order any cocktails, alcohol or dessert.   Pricing was a little bit more than what I expected, so it's not a place you will be dining at several times a week; but definitely a place to check out and return to periodically."}
{"text":"The portions are small and the dishes are expensive. If you do not accept this; you are likely to be disappointed. That being said, the quality and magnetism of everything is exceptional.   The octopus was excellent, with multiple different tastes, including pickled mustard seeds, mini tomatoes etc it was not at all chewy, but soft and tasteful. The ricotta starter, was unusual, with spicy oil, mushrooms, a good combination of textures, very rich.  The beef ribs were excellent both tender and full of taste. The lamb brochette/skewer was beautifully tender and rich in soft lamb tastes. Both of these were accompanied by small pots of different relish/sauces you could add - nothing out of the ordinary here.  We hand French fries which were small portions but well done, and the burnt eggplant, which is a particular taste but we enjoyed it.  Wines are quite expensive but nevertheless a good selection.  Service was very good, and informed.  We sat out on the patio which was lovely."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night, reservations are a must because it's very popular.   The meals are served family style, and everything was really delicious.  Burnt squash, green beans, chimmichuri sauce, empanadas, dulce de leche!  Alllll soooooo tasty!"}
{"text":"Located in a cozy townhouse in a pretty quiet neighbourhood, Branca on Dundas West is a quite a place. Its unique method of cooking meat is definitely something I've never heard of in Toronto.   I've been here three times so I'm going to combine my reviews together.  First Visit: We came here on a late Wed night for a drink. The ambience was great and we had a great time. We didn't get to try the food because we already had lots for dinner, but we got lucky and had the opportunity to tour the fire pit in the back where they roasted the meat every day. It's so cool. Gotta try the steaks and ribs next.   Second visit: I came here for my birthday on a Tuesday night with a group of 6 people in total. We arrived at 8pm and the restaurant was 75% full. So make sure to make reservations if you want to come, even on weekdays.   We had 4 apps in total, a 48oz 30day dry aged steak to share for everyone, 2 side dishes and 3 desserts plus the cake we brought. Everything was fabulous, especially the octopus appetizer and the dark chocolate with burned marshmallow dessert. Everybody was amazed by how well-flavoured the dishes were put together. You must try!  The service was on point too. There was never moment I ran out of wine or water in my glass!  Third visit - we sat at the bar and a few drinks and a dessert. The panqueques dessert was stellar!!! We ended up getting two more for the group Lol it's a stuffed small crepe, rolled up and with sugar torched on the surface. A little bit crunchy outside and soft inside. Dipped into whipped cream. So good."}
{"text":"loved this place. not cheap, but not expensive. Unique spot with great food"}
{"text":"Best skirt steak I've had period. Just go here why are you even reading this. There's really nothing I can say about this place that would deter you from going. Service and food is both top grade."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal at Branca. The restaurant has an exciting vibe and the servers are attentive and knowledgeable. If you like Argentinian-sytle grilled meat this is your kind of restaurant. We decided to take the share plate approach and started with the Empanadas -$6- and the Sepia (cuttlefish) -$15. Delicious. For the mains we had the Skirt Steak -$19-, Lamb -$28-, and Short Rib -$26-. The meat was all grilled perfectly but the short rib stood out as my favourite. The smoked collared greens were a perfect accompaniment to the meat. I was also pleasantly surprised by the 'Condinentos' (condiments) which didn't seem like an afterthought and really added t the meal. Try the chimichurri and poblano romesco - they're both extremely good.   You're going to leave this restaurant feeling satisfied and full so come hungry."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. The char on the meat was perfect, memories of summer. The sauce with the asparagus to die for.  We were stuffed and left some fries.   Love how they serve everything for sharing. We had the lamb and beef short ribs and both were absolutely delicious.   A trio of sauces complimented the meats without overpowering them. They were freshly made sauces and you can taste it. Great wines.   As it was my friend's birthday, they comped us a dessert with a candle and it was delicious too, perfect for sharing and the perfect ending to a great meal.   It's a great date night place. It seems loud at first but not overly loud as you don't hear other people's conversation and we weren't shouting at each other either. It's a place to have a leisurely dinner and celebration. A dinner to remember and I'll be back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Very solid Argentinean restaurant. I'm from Argentina, so I'll offer my critique from that perspective...  The dishes are all very good (we tried most everything.. favourite was the chicken, but of course the entrana (inside skirt steak) was solid, with nice chimichurri sauce to boot. Would have liked slightly larger portions on the starters (especially the provoleta) because the intent is to share the food.   Inventive, modern twist on everything, without losing the core ingredients and preparation style that make these classic Argentine comfort food dishes so great. Cocktails were also tasty.  Our only complaint was the salchicha (sausage) was a bit undercooked... but it didn't stop us from eating it all!  I would love to see an expanded menu, with some more cuts of meat that we don't see in Canada, such as bife de chorizo, vacio, and morcilla. Would also like to see full-sized empanadas, not just cocktail-sized, and more variety of fillings -- which is a great opportunity to be innovative. And of course, if their hallmark is the Parilla, they need to offer a Parilla Mixta for the table, where we can get a sampler of various meats (and chorizos please!) on a spectacular wooden cutting board to dig into! Not to mention way more substantial steak knives, please!  Overall, really pleased to see Argentine food done right, and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. The octopus was amazing and I'm usually not a fan. The chorizo was super tender. They make the best Pisco Sour I've had outside of Chile. An extremely pleasant and accommodating staff. Great music, good vibes and an unusually well-appointed space given the neighbourhood. It's a bit expensive but I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yum - cannot wait to go back. We did not have reservations but the staff made it happen and in no time we were sitting down at a table, sipping on cocktails and devouring a delicious skirt steak. The ambience and lighting was nice and romantic and the restaurant was popping for a week day night."}
{"text":"Branca is a tiny restaurant with a nice patio alongside the chefs cooking outside. We sat outside on a warm summer evening which we enjoyed but we weren't even given a choice which I thought was a little odd. Also, our reservation was for 9pm but I called to see if we could be accommodated earlier and were told \"No, we are very busy.\"  That's fine, except it really didn't look that busy when we got there.   We ordered 2 empanadas, octopus, skirt steak and roasted carrots. The food was good but not outstanding. With the exception of the octopus, I felt these were all standard flavours and textures I could easily create at home.   One big drawback was that the salsa and chimichurri came so late. We had already almost finished the steak when the sauces came. The steak was definitely enhanced with the sauces.   Finally, the wine list is limited and expensive. Also, there is only one beer on tap. Cocktails are fashioned well.   Overall, it was a good dining experience but not great. I can see that a few years ago, this restaurant was listed as one of the city's best but it can't hold that torch anymore."}
{"text":"My bf and I went whimsically on a Saturday night- Branca had been on my list of restaurants to check out for some time. Dim lighting, small restaurant, great place for date night. As we did not make a reservation, only the bar was available when we stopped in- small bar, only seats 4 ppl. We had a great time chatting with one of the bartenders, Donavan, he gave us the low down on all the food and accommodated our request to surprise us with different cocktails to try out- all was great! I would highly recommend the suckling pig and collard greens."}
{"text":"TLDR; fantastic food. Dishes are sweet and savoury. Wines are reasonable and tasty. Atmosphere is cozy but very dark.   Atmosphere:  Hostess and waitress were very friendly and attentive. Food came quickly but didn't feel rush. Room was cozy with banquettes. I thought the room was a bit too dimly lit. Good music! Plates were fabulous. Main dishes are served on a plank of wood with a large bone handle steak knife.  Food  We were told by the server that the recommended meal size was 2 appetizers, 2 mains, and 2 sides for 2 people.   Beets and Burrata: on the sweeter side, but nicely paired with the tartness of the beets and creamy cheese.  Octopus: a MUST order. Not even sure what I was eating (in a good way) also sweet and savoury. So fabulous.  Skirt Steak: very good. Well cooked   Lamb Shank: least favourite dish, nice texture and well cooked but too salty. Wouldn't order this again.  The main dishes were served with three condiments each for $1. Our favourite was the chimichurri, then eggplant. Our least favourite was the poblano romanesco. I didn't like the texture  As sides, we ordered the burnt carrots and the fries. Both were great. Fries are great for mopping up your plate at the end.   Dessert: we had the crepes with chantilly. The burnt caramel taste was wonderful.     Drinks  We don't know a lot about wine, but we had the Argentinian Malbec and it was lovely and paired well with the food"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. If you want to try a totally different palate than you're used to, this is where to go. The steakhouse description is a total misnomer. There's nothing Brazilian or Argentinian or whatever nationality steak houses came from here. The best things on the menu are the starters and the tastes are just.... Yeah, phenomenal. Top picks: the octopus. So succulent and flavorful and topped with a marinade that was almost as good as the shrimp. Seriously well balanced. The burrata. A cheese mound that looked like my shaving cream but tasted so much better, was salted, cheesy, moist. Wow. So much good happening with this restaurant. A definite up and comer in a venue that looks like it could be your really sweet grandmas house from the outside."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to legit Asado from an Argentinian friend - I have been obsessed ever since and Branca is where I get my fix when I can't wait on my friend's next BBQ. It is expensive and at first I was skeptical but after trying everything I was not disappointed. The pork was the best and we took inspiration from their \"grilled lettuce\"/ceasar and make it at home now. One time the beef was overcooked tho."}
{"text":"Food: Extremely small portions, generally underwhelming, exorbitantly priced.   Service: I've typed and retyped this a few times trying to figure out how to convey the absolute disappointment we felt with the service at Branca. After making a reservation and spending over $300 at Branca we were asked to vacate our table as \"there were other guests waiting\", despite the fact that we were still eating our dessert and finishing cocktails... cocktails the waitstaff recommended we order while waiting for our dessert since \"it might take a while\". We hadn't been there for an extraordinarily long time, in fact the table of 8 that had been seated before us were still there and seemingly enjoying their evening without being asked to move on out so someone else could be seated.   It was a very uncomfortable end to the evening and we were honestly appalled that we were asked to leave while still finishing our extremely expensive meal.   Not only are we not recommending Branca to friends, we're actively letting them know that the food certainly doesn't come close to making up for the awful customer service."}
{"text":"Branca is a tiny restaurant located in a small townhouse at the south east corner of Dundas and Lansdowne. The ambiance is dark but welcoming. The walls are covered with paper adorned with what look like palm leaves and natural light is let in through a wall of windows on the east side.   Seating is limited because it is a small space, but we didn't have trouble getting a table for 3 at 7pm. However, the tables did fill up quickly as the evening went on. The food comes out quickly so you're sitting around waiting for too long.   To start, we got the smoked beef and mushroom empandas. Both were smaller than I expected but delicious nonetheless. The beef came with a tomato salsa and a hot salsa that we loved so much we requested it again when the mushroom empanadas came out. I would highly recommend the empanadas!   Next came the baked ricotta accompanied with toasted bread slices. This dish was excellent as well, the cheese was creamy and the mushrooms on top added texture and flavour. My only complaint is that I wish there was more bread! Not everyone is on a low carb diet.   Our main was the short ribs with potato strings. We were torn between the strings or the eggplant so our waitress made the decision for us and recommended the strings. We were not disappointed! The short ribs dish was also smaller than I expected but again, delicious. I was afraid it wouldn't be enough to fill us up but it was just enough. The strings were curly and lightly sprinkled with a reddish seasoning and parsley.   I easily found green p street parking right outside. The service was friendly and attentive. Our server answered all the questions we had and gladly provided us with a hotter hot sauce and additional salsa when we asked. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Branca is a new spot by Dundas and Lansdowne.  Looks like they renovated the main floor of a house and made it into a resto with about 10-15 tables.  We got the skirt steak and short rib which were both amazing! the condiments were perfect and everything else was on point.  They cook all the meat al asador style in a room in the \"backyard\".   Definitely get the potato strings, they were my fave of all the sides (they were all good though).  The space is limited so get cozy with your neighbours but the staff is very knowledgeable and the food speaks for itself.  This is a great place for small groups (2-4) and I would recommend making reservations at least 4 days before just to be safe."}
{"text":"Overpriced tiny tiny portions (should be embarrassed to serve this really) The octopus appetizer gets you about 4\" worth of octopus, and it costs $23!  If you have ever actually had Argentinian food, you will know this is far from authentic.  They can't even get chimichuri right. It feels like you are being ripped off all along the way as the serving sizes are extremely small and should be called \"tapas\" style so you know what you are getting.  Servers were not very friendly and too many people were walking in and out of the kitchen-overall gave us an unprofessional vibe.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"We will not be back to branca. The food was good but over priced, our server was ok but a little odd in an awkward way but what set the tone was the first few minutes of our arrival. We had a 1 yr old baby with us and had let staff know the week before to ensure we would have what we needed. When we arrived we went to the host on the patio. As we approached I noticed a table outside of the patio area of which the main area was half full at 8pm and was indicated as our table. Not happy with this  I asked if we could have a corner table in the back when he indicated our table was the isolated table. He responded NO abruptly and when queried why he again abruptly and rudely said because the table I wanted to move to was reserved. I was not happy with this and my face showed this. He responded 1 minute later that we could move to the other table and walked away. In that moment, as I had made the reservation week prior, I questioned if we should stay because this place also required a 100$ hold in your credit card through OT to reserve and I was concerned about how the rest of the night would go. We did not feel welcome at all and we there to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. It was so disappointing that our experience with staff was negative having seen many great reviews  (with the exception of the staff in the red dress ) Lastly ... the patio nevered filled for the duration of our meal; something that was not lost on us."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining in Toronto. Coming from NY, I was weary and didn't know what to expect. This place BLEW ME AWAY.   Service: Excellent. Attentive, helpful, and timed delivery of appetizer and entrees perfectly.   Food: Incredible. Let me tell you, those short ribs are the BEST I've ever had. Cut through them like butter. Exceptionally seasoned. Simply out of this world.   Ambience: Very chill. Nothing but good vibes.   I highly recommend this place. Make a reservation just to be safe!"}
{"text":"Literally became one of my top 3 fav in Toronto.  Highlight:  Their 3 complimentary salsa that comes with your dishes. 5/5. Onion was my fav though.  App: Smoked Beef Empanadas: 4.8/5. Beef was marinated and smoked right, the wrap is perfectly fried/baked with right amount of greasiness and oily aroma (not in a negative way!) Reminds me of fried dumplings but so much better.  Lamb Merguez & roasted dates: 5.5. Words can't describe how perfectly this is marinated.   Main: Inside skirt steak: 4/5. Med rare is good. Not a big fan of beef but this one is good, with the herbs on top.  Heritage pork tomahawk: 5/5. The most tenderly roasted pork ever. They roast it maple-brined. Heaven on earth."}
{"text":"I was debating whether to give this place a 3 or 4. This is an intimate place.  Very dark, i actually found it difficult to read my menu.  The service was very friendly and somewhat helpful. The Morcilla and Pulpo were delicious to start with.  Then we had the Humita and Caramelized Endives as sides.  The Humitas were very good.  I was tempted to order a second round.  I found you can't go wrong here with the sides and appetizers here.  They are all reasonably priced and satisfying.  Full of flavour and wonderfully presented.  The Entrana a La Parrilla was delicious and well cooked.  We ordered it medium rare.  Sadly, it was served slightly cooler than I would have liked it.  What really disappointed me was the Pork dish, I forget what the waitress called it.  She kept raving over it.  In the end, that one pork dish was a $42 small thin piece of pork served even cooler than the beef.  For $42 i would have rather ordered another two beef dishes.  In the end, knowing I spent $42 for a palm sized thin slice of somewhat bland pork killed my experience.  For that price I could have had a tasty full size steak at any of Toronto's high end Steak houses."}
{"text":"A great little place hidden in a part of the city that's being reborn.  The service for the most part was excellent apart from one waitress that came off a little snobby. Nothing too bad but she did warm up later in the evening.  The food is delicious albeit a little pricey for the small portions you receive considering we were told things were meant to be shared.  Dinner for 2 with a bottle of wine was $230 (tax & tip included).  To start we had the corn and cheese empanadas which were the size of 3 little perogies.  The baby romaine salad which reminds you of a cesar salad but sweater with the orange honey vinaigrette.  And final the mollejas (sweetbreads) which I love and order every time I see them on a menu.  They were very tender but had a lovey crispy exterior. They may have even won over my partner as well who was always squeamish in the past when she tried them.  For our mains we enjoyed the skirt steak and grilled halibut.  Both perfectly cooked.  I'm not a fan of restaurants cutting my meat but I guess you kinda have to with skirt stake.  The halibut came topped with chimichurri which was nice and bright but not overpowering like some tend to be.  Mains come a la cart so we went with crispy potato strings and burnt carrots for our sides.  This is where your meal can start to add up as the mains are $20+ and the sides $6 each.  I do recommend the burnt carrots.  They were fantastic and I'd definitely order them again.  The waitress also recommended we order the condiments as well to go with our appetizers and main.  Seems a little silly to charge $1 each for these.  I'd kind of expect them to be given as part of your meal.  They all fall into the good/not great category.    We're both dessert people and recommend you try them as well.  The lemon tart was our favourite but the golden dome chocolate mousse was very nice a well.  A little rich and it could have used a little more sour cherry sauce.  All and all we're glad we tried Branca.  Food and service were great.  Decor (wallpaper) may not be everyone taste.  Would we go back?  Errr...probably not and that's only due to the price.  There are plenty of great places in the city where your money will go further for a meal that's just as good."}
{"text":"It's a nice place for hanging out with friends or have a romantic date. This is first time I try Argentina food. They have different menu for patio and inside. I came here with some friends before the Pan An Game. We had Langostinos for appetizer. It's a combination of crunch from tostones, sourness from crema, sea-freshness from the shrimp. I believe this is first time I try fried strings too.  Amazing presentation! We had lampchop, steak and also smoke hen. When it was served, you can smell the smoke right away. Now I can recognize the difference between American steak styles and Argentina style. The steak and lamb chop are pretty juicy, tender with rich flavour while American steak is more firmly. I tried their Pan Am game dessert too. it's pretty cool to me."}
{"text":"Tried the provoleta cheese and is delicious... And with the main plates u can't go wrong with ribs and the entra√±a."}
{"text":"This place is a gem!  Did a pre-fix with a group here recently and we were all really impressed. For $55 a head, the food - which included a variety of starters, mains, sides and dessert - was plentiful, so very worth the price. Everything tasted great! The empanadas and grilled romaine were a treat, and the fire roasted chicken had the most intense amazing flavour, as did the steak.  Our server was very attentive and friendly. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about my experience here.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husbands steak craving lead us to Branca.  They were able to fit us in for an early 6:30pm reservation which we appreciated.    I also appreciated that they were clear that the table needed to be flipped within 2 hours, without sounding like jerks.  All the other reviews are true.  Food is fantastic as is the service. They have the best olives I have ever had.   Only thing holding them back from 5 stars is that I felt the wine by the glass offering was too minimal."}
{"text":"Excellent grilled meat here! The short rib, lamb skewer, and sides were delicious and flavourful. The meat had a good amount of char on the outside, was cooked perfectly and still moist on the inside. The side dishes were great, but I found that the portions were small for the hefty price. Definitely a nice place to go to for a special occasion or on a date.  We also ordered the grilled octopus but the texture tasted overdone? It was the texture of pork and was a bit flaky, although the flavour was there.  Service was great. Very attentive and the atmosphere was quite trendy, yet dim and romantic. Great place to try some Argentinian food!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for great service... and that makes me a sucker for Branca. The staff was attentive, charming, and professional. Ambiance was romantic... will be even more so when the patio opens. We had the Smoked Beef Empanadas, and the Entrana a La Parrilla (Inside Skirt Steak) with a side of Brussel Sprouts. The steak came out warm, but it was medium rare as requested, well seasoned, and still delicious. Everything else was great."}
{"text":"Excellent! We went with another couple.  All four of us started with pisco sours. We ordered 2 skirt steaks (very tender, a perfect medium-rare), beef short rib and lamb skewer (both were good), and each of the sides.  The fries and sun chokes were highlights.  I highly recommend them.  All this plus 3 glasses of wine came to $240 after tax, which seems really reasonable for the amount of food (we couldn't finish it) and alcohol.  Our server seemed unhappy (she didn't smile all evening) but otherwise polite and provided good service.  The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the meat was good, but not amazing."}
{"text":"This is a nice, chill, relaxed spot to have a nice dinner. Great place for a nice date.  The food is authentic Argentinian barbecue, and it is very red-meat focused (although they did offer one  chicken and one fish option).   The food is fantastic, although pricey for the portion sizes.  We started with the house smoked salmon (classic, with creme fraiche & toast points), the burrata/beet salad, and split the roast chicken and an order of the \"burnt\" carrots.   It was plenty of food for two people.   The wines by the glass were not great; but they have a nice bottle list, so I would recommend picking from there.  Full bar, too!"}
{"text":"Located in a semi detached house, this unassuming restaurant really sticks to doing things right in the kitchen (or in the backyard when it comes to any of their smoked items). It has a lovely dark and moody vibe, and the staff is super friendly. Loved their octopus!"}
{"text":"The food is great but when you charge $50 for a piece of fish with extra salt, you must be joking.  This is the problem with Toronto, too many random small restaurants charging Michlen prices.  This is the second time we've been here and we will not go back, the amount of sodium intake makes your legs weak."}
{"text":"Came here for my fianc√©es early birthday celebration. He loves meat so this was definitely the place for him!! We enjoyed the pulpo (grilled octopus) to start and this was absolutely delicious!! We then ordered the beef short ribs and the suckling pig. I liked how it came out on a giant wooden board. 10 points for presentation. The pig was unique bc it was cuts from different parts of the big, and all of them were slightly different and tender. I liked the pork belly the best. The meat is made on the Al Asador BBQ, an Argentinian way of cooking, and minimally seasoned with just a touch of salt. That's where the condiments come into play, at a buck each you can try these deliciously flavoured condiments with the meat. We had roasted garlic, roasted eggplant and chimmichurri. All of these added soo much punch to the meat and took this to a while other level of experience!! We had caramalized endives and curly fries as sides which really made it a rounded meal. They were all good. For dessert, I had noted on their reservation system that it was my fianc√©es bday, they brought out their dulce de leche crepes with a candle on the side! They were divine - so light fluffy and a bit of burnt caramel. I could have had 2 of these dishes to myself! Ontop of this, they comp'd our dessert, which we didn't expect, it was a nice touch! We will def be coming back since we love so close to this area!"}
{"text":"Fantastic spot. Great grilled dishes. Wine menu is fantastic. We loved that they brought out an amouse bouche and some little shortbread cookies to start and end our meal. We had the empanadas, grilled romaine, chicken, and steak. All incredible!"}
{"text":"The general manager emailed me 48 hours before our dinner reservation to confirm it after failing to send out a confirmation when I made the reservation.  It stated a $25 would be charged for any guest who doesn't attend the reservation as noted 48 hours out. So basically giving us no time to make any changes.  I would look elsewhere in Toronto."}
{"text":"We came for flavour and a memorable night out. Branca did not disappoint. We had the great pleasure of being served by the manager during our visit, and when we asked for a post dinner behind the scenes tour to see just how the amazing food was cooked - she was gracious enough to give us the grand tour. Nothing but hard lump charcoal is used to Bbq and/or grill the meats. Amazing. The cocktails were special, and well prepared. Dessert - the burnt marshmallow, wow - this is a do not miss. The atmosphere is dimly lit and very sexy while still being welcoming. A great date night or evening with friends."}
{"text":"My partner and I came here to celebrate his birthday. We both had an expetional time at Branca. The service was great, the waiters were extremely attentive and quick to serve us  The food was delicious, I highly reccommend the lamb wrapped in prosciutto with dates the meat incredibly tender and full of flavour. Would definately come back!"}
{"text":"Our favourite date spot.  Did their New Years Prix Fixe and have been in multiple less fancy occasions and we are always impressed with our wait staff and the food is PHENOMENAL. There is an octopus dish that I can't recommend enough - very soft and melty (never rubbery) and SO full of flavour.  The food here is better than most of the more expensive restaurants, and Branca isn't really that expensive.  Like I said, tip top date spot.  Super duper comfy.  I do miss the basement of flamingo wallpaper though."}
