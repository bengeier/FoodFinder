{"text":"My wife and I each ordered from the family menu. The food was very good and plentiful. The servers here were very helpful and attentive. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Seemed to be a family owned business that takes great pride in their products and services. Nice little quiet place to dine. Very attentive staff."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to this restaurant ever since it was located on Darrow road in Hudson. Best Chinese food we've ever found. No other Chinese restaurant can top the war su gai and kong pao chicken that is served here. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are Thai food fanatics and were excited to try this restaurant after seeing the reviews. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed. We both tried one of their Thai dishes ( Pad Thai and panang curry) and their Thai coconut soup.  All ingredients were sub par and cooked terribly. The dishes as a whole were not flavorful: which is awful considering my husband and I use very little salt in our cooking. Furthermore, the servicer was inattentive and our bill was outrageously expensive. No redeeming qualities about this restaurant.   I do, however, recommend the restaurant Thai Pho for this area."}
{"text":"Definitely a find in Streetsboro! Thai and Chinese dishes.  Food was excellent with generous portions. Spices were great - best masaman and parang curries. Don't let the old Pizza Hut building fool you.  Wish we lived closer - it'd be a \"go to\" spot."}
{"text":"I was there last night to celebrate birthdays with friends.  We all had shrimp pad Thai and it was fabulous!  A hidden gem in Streetsboro! Will definitely return to check out additional dishes!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal with large portions.  The food was very flavorful.  Our party of four ordered General Chicken, Hawaiian Chicken, Butterfly Shrimp off the Chinese menu and Thai Shrimp with Noodles.  Everything was amazing!  Won Ton soup had the best flavor, egg rolls were delicious - not a bad plate on the table!    Waiter was very attentive and great service.  We will definately be back - our new favorite Asian restaurant!  Prices were higher than other local Chinese places, but with the large portions and quality of food, was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, and nice people.  The food is fresh and delicious. The environment is cosy and clean. I went there with my family to have dinner and we definitely would go again."}
{"text":"What a find! Staying in an interchange hotel, we had no idea where to eat. Fast food, bar fare and Chinese buffets seemed our only choices. Then we saw Tai Wah, tucked behind some trees. Cozy with ambient lighting and a small beer selection, this jewel offers a variety of Asian fare...Thai, Vietnamese, Korean, and Chinese.  Delicious! We had the Phone Bo, Vietnamese noodle soup, flavored with mint, peppers, and lime.  Mmmmm.  We also ordered traditional chicken pad Thai. Lightly seasoned, slightly sweet...outstanding. What a great night. We will return."}
{"text":"stopped here randomly after all the other local places were closed.. what a pleasant surprise! the owners (I'm assuming) were extremely, extremely pleasant, despite me barging in for take-out 9 minutes before they closed. the restaurant was immaculately cleaned. the menu offered Chinese and Thai selections. I got pot stickers and tofu pad Thai. both items were outstanding. the lady bringing my food to me even refused the tip I offered her... I recommend this place over all the Asian places in the area."}
{"text":"So it might only be 4 stars in a major metro but its still really good and I'd still eat there.  Stopped for dinner passing through.  Food was cooked with obvious care,  fresh ingredients, and real authenticity.  Won ton soup was handmade wontons with a rich broth (not the pale yellow stuff)  got hunan style pork and sichuan tofu plus fried rice.  All the mains were very well done. Light flavorful sauce,  not goopy,  and complex flavors.  Portions were huge.  Only complaint was that it wasn't really that spicy as it should be but it is Ohio.  They also have Thai dishes on the menu but didn't try them. Would definitely go back.  It's a family run place and done with much more care than a lot of Chinese restaurants.  And a whole lot better and healthier than ruby Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!!  Everything was incredible! Pork egg rolls the best we ever had! Highly recommend! Chinese food the way it should be!"}
{"text":"The shrimp pad thai was a little bland for my taste (even after requesting a \"hot\" spice level) however the shrimp massaman curry was delicious!  Great portions sizes as well! The owner was so friendly and welcoming. I'd definitely return to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I had been driving past Tai Wah for a while and finally stopped in to give it a try. We were warmly welcomed and led to our large table complete with lazy Susan that sat the 5 of us. The menu offered many choices of traditional Chinese as well as Thai dishes. The food was expertly prepared. Bright crispy vegetables, and perfectly cooked protein with flavorful sauces. We only tried the Chinese dishes. Everything was reasonably priced. Our party of five had appetizers, soup, entree's and a few cocktails for an even $100 tab and two bags of food left over to take home. I will no longer just drive by Tia Wah. Next time, I look forward to trying some of the Thai dishes."}
{"text":"Okay, it is an old Pizza Hut.  It not a fancy Asian restaurant. What it is, is a family owned business that takes pride in their food, makes it to order and delivers!  This is by fare the best Thai food in the Cleveland area, and it is in Streetsboro.     So when you go in and find some of the lights out because they are saving electricity, just sit down and get over it.  Putting your initial impressions on the back burner for a moment will be greatly rewarded.  Make sure you start off with one of the soups.  They are amazing and fresh.  I guarantee you will not have had anything like it.  I also recommend the Green Curry.   The daughter had chicken lemongrass something or other.  it too was really good.  But I am a Green Curry guy and this was way, way over the top good.  This is worth traveling a good 15 - 20 miles for.  Or further if you really crave the good stuff.  They have a full bar and it is great for larger groups.  The hostess is awesome."}
{"text":"Soooooo great! Good quality food. Ordered the red curry and it was pretty decent! I'll DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, but I'll be back. It was also my first time to try Thai food. The whole experience was memorable. The owners are delightful friendly people, the service was prompt and efficient, and the food was wonderful. I will definitely be a regular here, and will bring the family."}
{"text":"In Korea they say \"mott oop soy yo\" which means \"taste there is none\" .  I read the reviews and said hey, road trip! An undiscovered gem!   Nope. The food comes out hot and looks very pretty, but DO NOT come here thinking it will be Thai or even generic chinese food.  Seriously, like my one friend used to say about Taco Bell \"mexican food for white people\".   This place is not serving to customers food that they eat themselves. I am truly disappointed.   This is to Thai food what a hamburger is to Thai food.   It was hot and served nicely but I would rather have authentic taste and bad service.  Really really really disappointed. Which is hard to do to me, I give out four star ratings like water. Disappointed will never be back.  Tasted like it was made with bottles of sugar water and tuned to the tastes of Amish. I am changing review to one star. This place *****.  Cannot believe I got suckered by a bogus  4 1/2 star overall rating. Well, consider the locale I guess."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed visiting this new Chinese restaurant not far from my office.  It took over an old Pizza Hut building and to be honest, it still feels a little like Pizza Hut inside, which is a little bit surreal, but the owner came out to greet us and we felt very much at home there.  The restaurant serves Thai food and Chinese.  If you want, you can also order off the \"Chinese\" menu, which gives you more authentic choices- the kind of things that real Chinese people order when they go out.  My friends ordered the lunch specials which are a good value.  I ordered the \"Sasha beef\" off the Chinese menu.  It was really tasty- just what Chinese \"BBQ\" tastes like.  I also ordered the Red Curry which was a bit mild for my taste, but still quite good, even though it had zucchini and I don't generally like zucchini.  Wouldn't have minded if the sauce was a little thicker.  Thirdly I got the shrimp with lobster sauce, which is a classic Chinese banquet dish.  Really loved the sauce on this- very authentic.    My friend's dishes were interesting- not quite the typical breaded and deep fried Chinese American food.  As a result they were lighter tasting- like you are a guest at someone's house.  It is likely a lot healthier for you- you don't feel dirty after eating it like I sometimes do after eating American Chinese food.    Portions are a good value and the hostess was very sweet.  I plan to come back or order delivery from this place in the future."}
{"text":"I'm a native from Streetsboro so when I found out this place was right under my nose, I had to give it a shot! The service was awesome, and it's family owned so that was definitely a bonus. The food was delicious!!! The portions were generous and the price was right! I'm very impressed to say the least. I highly recommend giving it a try, it's totally worth the foodgasm"}
{"text":"How CUTE! My family were the only people in here! Empty but lots of seats are open! Food is always great :) If your by the area I recommend coming here completely! Every time I come nobody's ever in here but there always so nice. I love this place so much! It's cute but lots of open seating and a lot of choice for food. Love this place, great take-out too!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! Great spot for vegans & vegetarians! Suggest the veggie lo mein and the yellow curry!  The owner was so kind and funny too. Prices were great for lunch and the food was beyond amazing.  Best place to eat in Streetsboro!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after a long stressful snowy drive from Chicago on the way to DC. Found Tai Wah on yelp and because of its 4.5 stars we decided to take a chance.  WOW!!!! What an amazing meals. The server was surprised that our children ordered from the authentic menu instead of chicken tenders and they were very pleased with the 3 cup chicken and steamed pork ribs with black bean sauce. I ordered the green beans and pork dish which was equally yummy. The service was awesome and we highly recommend Tai Wah!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in the area! Everything is sooo fresh and tasty. Best potstickers I have ever had. Coconut shrimp soup is a favorite. Hidden gem for sure as they are never busy. Little pricy but you pay for what you get."}
{"text":"Forget all of the fast food and franchise places and get some fresh, fabulous food at Tai Wah Asian. We're so glad we did. It was thanks to Yelp we found this gem. I had the veggie chop suey - the best I've ever had - crunchy mung and bean sprouts, lots of fresh vegetables, and a wonderfully light sauce. My husband had the red curry beef. Large portion, fresh veggies and a sauce that enhanced instead of overwhelmed. We loved meeting the owner who clearly takes pride in providing authentic Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I always get the orange chicken but everything over had is great.  The lady who runs the place is really nice and they have a good menu."}
{"text":"It is an old Pizza Hut. But if you want real Chinese food then you go here. I have lived in China for 12 years. And I come here for the real deal. (I was born in Cleveland)"}
{"text":"Great authentic food. Great place. And truly I am impressed by the up to date and clean restrooms. I have been to many Chinese restaurants where one would be scared to even wash their hands in the restrooms. Not here!  Very clean and up to date. Nice job!"}
{"text":"Horrible no taste chinese food...even though it has real chinese people making the food. The servers nice, but when the food was not cooked right, no taste we informed them and they were like no its good. We had to add more spices more salt more pepper...I just think no one orders anything more authentic, the white rice was hard and nasty ugh..never going there again, rather go to Newdle Bar in Kent, or Toko Japanese...so much better."}
{"text":"Had lunch there on a Monday, place was practically empty. However, the food is awesome. The egg roll is perhaps the bast I've ever had. The Mongolian beef was superb, just spicy enough to get my attention. I just hope they make it here. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"So, we (wife, daughter) were stopping off in Streetsboro on our way back to Chelsea, Michigan, from D.C.  Tired of pizza, wife checked around a bit and discovered this place, so we got take-out Pad Thai.  To say we were surprised at the quality is an understatement.  We really thought it was excellent.  We highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went to the Tai Wah Asian Cuisine on June 28, at around 9:00pm in streetsboro ohio. This was our first visit to this restaurant. I will never return to this restaurant.  The visit I experienced was bad. Started out fine, the food wasn't the greatest but the waiter was very courteous. One of the people with us received a plate of shrimp with noodles. They didn't like the taste of it so we asked the waiter if they could have something else for the same price. He went in the back talking to his manager I assume. Wanted to know what was wrong with it the person with us told him that they just didn't like the taste and wanted to know if they could take it away and substitute it with  something else. So we ended up requesting to speak with manager. The manager looked at her and rudely told her if you don't like it don't order it no apologies for the circumstance. Then the manager yelled at the waiter right infront of us I guess it was because he was trying to help us. I realize why there were no other customers in there now bad food, high prices and rude management."}
{"text":"So very good!!! Stopped in for lunch and the owner was extremely sweet and welcoming. You can tell they really care about what they serve, everything tasted amazing and seemed higher quality than a lot of other Chinese places in the area. Generous portions as well. We tried a couple of the Thai options and Chinese.Tom Yum Goong soup, Pad Thai w/ shrimp, Hawaiian chicken, and Massaman curry w/ chicken. All were awesome, but the soup and curry dishes really stood out! I will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Coming in I wasn't sure what to expect since Chinese-American cuisine is pretty mediocre in many places around Ohio I've seen, but this place really goes out of its way to make great food, as a matter of fact they call their Chinese cuisine \"Cantonese\"...a very good sign. Don't judge the place by the interior (it might of been a pizza hut at one point lol), just focus on what comes out of the kitchen. It was a good selection of Chinese and Thai dishes. I ordered Empress Chicken and my girlfriend ordered Generals Chicken. They give you a really generous portion of the dish with rice. One order of either dish must of taken at least two whole chicken breasts. It was very filling.   The part that might be crazy for me is that fact that Chinese food in general you can eat it and it goes right through you like beer, but I was full for a good 4-5 hours. It makes a difference when this restaurant serves you more of the dish and less rice as opposed to the generic Chinese-American restaurants that serve you a ton of rice with a little bit of the dish."}
{"text":"First visit tonight for carry out.  Sweet and sour chicken was great, it was perfectly fine and very tender.  I like the sauce on the side so the breaking doesn't get soggy.  Egg roll was the best I have had since I can remember :) Beef lo Leon was good, my daughter liked it.. wasn't too salty and had good flavor.  Hawaii chicken was good but it's something I've never ordered so the flavor was different, but good.  Nancy handled the order and was nice, food was piping hot and ready in 20 minutes..  my only suggestion is to put a take out menu in bag since I forgot to grab one ;)"}
{"text":"We were so pleased to find Tai Wah's new location in Streetsboro.    We had been patrons at their former location in Hudson and thought they had gone out of business.    We always have enjoyed their food.   The servers and owner are so friendly and attentive.   Maybe not gourmet Chinese but good.   If you live in the area, give it a try."}
{"text":"I've never written anything on Yelp but I want to say this place is Mad Awesome! Great and authentic food with reasonable price and portion. The lady at the front desk (she probably owns this restaurant) is super nice. I'm really surprised there is such an amazing Chinese restaurant in a small town. Thank you Tai Wah for making my short stay here memorable :)"}
{"text":"Best Chinese and Thai we've had in a very long time!  We were passing through and took a chance on this place!  So worth it!!!  Great curry!"}
{"text":"I am torn on a 4 star. The amount of food is really good but definitely not the best I have ever had. I decide on a Thai restaurant by their pad Thai. I walked in and ordered a Chicken Pad Thai (spicy) and a glass of wine while I waited. Upon sitting at the bar, I forgot to order pot stickers so I asked for them to be added on.  I immediately heard the microwave when the owner yelled to the kitchen. Hmmm, did I hear that right? Naw. Moments later, probably 90 seconds, I heard the ding, ding, ding of a finished dish.       Its ready!        The food: better than average BUT I always compare to the place in Cleveland (Map of Thailand) that we now frequent.  This was good buy I did add Siracha and Hoisin to make it a little more flavorful."}
{"text":"Ordered Pho Ga at Tai Wah Asian Cuisine and received one of the best noodle soups I've had in the entire country! I've had Pho Ga in Illinois, Arizona and San Fran. This place is on par and better! I'll be coming back to visit when in the local area. Wait staff attentive and real. Nice clean decor. Comfortable atmosphere. Large menu encompassing Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese."}
{"text":"They greeted me as I walked in the door & seemed genuinely friendly. Lots of food for a reasonable price & it's delicious!  Best egg rolls I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. I have been a regular since they were in Hudson. The owners are fantastic and have taken the time to get to know my family. If one of us does not show up she genuinely asks to make sure they are doing alright! She knows my order to a tee and knows that I won't need a menu. Not only are the owners great, the food is phenomenal. I take all of my friends here that have not yet tried it. The pork fried rice is my favorite and is the best I have ever had. No other Chinese restaurant has been able to top this one in my book. For newbies, go in the exit side that is where you find the podium. The \"enter\" side does not have a podium and may confuse you."}
{"text":"Thank god we found Tai Wah ! Our favorite Chinese restaurant changed owners and we were desperate to find a good replacement ! We look for cleanliness , a friendly staff and most of all delicious food that's made with fresh ingredients ! Tai Wah is all of that and we couldn't be happier that we found it ."}
{"text":"Don't be deterred if you're the only patron as we were. Reviews from two siblings and me:   Tai Wah has amazing rice. I didn't like the other part though. The spring roll was the best ever. The doors in the bathroom were very thin [for singing].   My tofu was delicious, particularly because it wasn't that silky stuff. Kung Po Tofu comes with peppers, onions and peanuts. Light spice.  Convenient that they serve Thai options since I'm so often disappointed by vegetarian Chinese. The curry has a fatty fullness and works well but is not exceptionally righteous. Our server was cutely nervous and ultimately a real delight.   Tai waht? Tai wah!"}
{"text":"Wish my parents and I had listened to the bad reviews.  We decided to try it because we were curious about it and there were a lot of good reviews, but there were some bad ones too.  We went on a Tuesday around 4:30 - 4:40pm and it was dead quiet.  We were the only ones in there.  A woman came by for carry out while we were there, but otherwise no one.  Even when we were done and leaving it was still dead.  I had the sesame chicken and it tasted like something I had made at home one time and decided never to make again.  It tasted more like a sour pineapple chicken with sesame seeds sprinkled on top. The broccoli wasn't cooked enough for my tastes, especially since broccoli isn't my favorite veggie in the world.  My dad had the green curry and he loved it.  He also had the hot and spicy soup and he said it was great. He was the only one who loved his meal.  After tasting my meal and hearing my moms' thoughts, I did not even want to try his curry meal.  My mom had the lo mein, but I can't remember if it had shrimp or just veggies and she said it was okay, but she would not order it again let alone come here again. She also had the wonton soup and said it was again, okay.  I tried a sip of her soup and wished I hadn't.  There was a flavoring to it I just can't describe that did not sit well with me.  There were only three things we agreed on.  First the lady who seated us was very friendly and second the hot oolong tea was great.  The third thing was at least the portions were a good size except the amount of rice they served with my and my fathers' meal.  There wasn't enough and my moms' meal didn't even come with rice.  She stole my dads' because he is not a rice eater and we shared some of mine, but it still was not enough rice for our tastes.  The woman who seated us though very friendly was slow, but she was an older woman.  As for the décor, we liked it.  It was very simple and it did need a fixer upper job, but it was acceptable."}
{"text":"Every time I go I try something different,  and I am never disappointed. These sweet local folks run a wonderful restaurant. I am always amazed that it is not packed every night of the week."}
{"text":"We dropped in last minute on a weekday night 40 mins. before closing. Offered us the \"real\" Chinese menu. Every dish was amazing in presentation, freshness, and flavor. Owner and hostess was so friendly and kind. They did not rush us. Will go there again on the way back.  The food was delicious and seemed very authentic!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for overpriced lean cuisine style Thai food then look no further! You will be served a generous portion of garbage & top it off by paying $25... put this place in a coffin because it is dead to me."}
{"text":"I live in Streetsboro, and I've been to Tai Wah a few times. I've tried a few things on their menu and everything has been fantastic! At the recommendation of another review, last night I tried the green curry. Once again, I was blown away! I fresh vegetables, and the taste of that Thai basil truly is outstanding. That slightly spicy, yet sweet flavor of the green curry was truly wonderful. I don't frequent Tiawah, because they are a little bit more expensive than some of the other Asian restaurants in town, but I've never been disappointed in what I get. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had yellow curry with shrimp. Service was food and fast. Good food and flavors. Next time will have green curry. Def worth the 3 min off I 80 and sit down."}
{"text":"I truly enjoy this place and what makes Tai Wah SO unique is it's location.  You would not expect in the heart of Streetsboro, Ohio with American cuisine and fast food establishments would be a wonderful little Thai and Asian styled restaurant!        As with my previous reviews, I always enjoy trying new Asian (especially Thai) restaurants with Pad Thai being one of my FAVORITE dishes!  So once I saw Pad Thai was on the menu I had to try it!  Immediately upon receiving the dish I was impressed.  The portion was HUGE!  (Sorry for no photo but I will do my best to describe it as I was EXTREMELY hungry at this moment).  The dish was a large oval shaped plate that, I kid you not, had about 2+ lbs. of noodles, meat and veggies within it!  WOW!  But portion means nothing without taste and quality.  I can say, it was there!  Perfectly blended sauce with spice (they actually ask you how spicy you want your meal; I like medium to hot but on this day I ordered medium).  Overall, this was one of the BEST Pad Thai dishes I have ever had.  Where some restaurants do skimp or short you on meat, they did not overwhelm the dish with a LOT of noodles with a few scrapes of meat, no, there was an even blend of meat to noodles and several veggies and sauce to match.  I will be eating here again and hopefully soon.        There were only a few small issues I had with Tai Wah.  One of them being you will wait a few minutes for your food but with this quality a simple soup or appetizer and good friend to have a wonderful meal with will pass the time in this pleasant environment.  The other issue I ran into was at the very end.  I was not expecting the fortune cookie to be stale with a fortune of \"People do and see the effort you put in all you do.\" Well, I wasn't going to put anymore effort into the last half of that fortune cookie but I always appreciate \"the message within\". I am looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"THE BEST. After a day of shopping and rock climbing we stumbled across this place. Didn't have high hopes but we weren't about to drive around. We got the beef shank and pork with black beans. Tip: there are TWO menus. The normal one, and the authentic Chinese one. Make sure you ask for the other menu if you want the authentic Chinese food (it's printed on one sheet and there's no sweet and sour chicken on it).  I am giving them five stars because our meal was so delicious. Unanimously agreed it was phenomenal. Two negatives: service was good but kinda slow (I think they were unusually busy and not prepared w enough staff). I ordered a Thai soup to try for an appetizer and didn't care for it."}
{"text":"Good food. Only one egg roll per portion - beware.   Pad Thai needed more vegetables but was generous with shrimp.  Average mussaman curry."}
{"text":"Best authentic Chinese location in town. Not to mention the Pho is my favorite from anywhere Akron to Cleveland."}
{"text":"I lived basically across the road from this place for over a year but never got around to going there.  Now that I've moved I finally tried it-- and am mad I waited so long! I ordered masaman curry and shrimp pad thai to go, and we really enjoyed both of them.  The curry was nicely sauced-- just the right level of curry and perfectly sweetened with coconut milk.  The chicken was in chunks but perfectly cooked. The pad thai was great, too.  The noodles were cooked just right and sauced just right.  A little squeeze of fresh lime and it was awesome.   And the leftovers were just as good the next day! I look forward to trying other items on the menu, especially things I haven't eaten before. Yes, the restaurant is a converted Pizza Hut but it didn't feel like it.  I'd be comfortable dining in as well. You gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"This is an absolute must visit if you've never been here before! Their curry is amazing and is one of the only places around Streetsboro where you can get freshly prepared Asian food. Their vegetables and meat looked and tasted fresh and everything was so delicious! I was very impressed and will definitely be back for more!"}
