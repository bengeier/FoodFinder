{"text":"Sushi Enshoku is delicious! I am a big sushi eater and I will definitely be going back. Not only was the fish fresh tasting, but the manager (possibly owner) speaks English, which helps me greatly as I do not speak much french. I ordered smoked Salmon and red snapper nigiri, California roll and a new york roll. All delicious! Also, this restaraunt makes their own soy sauce, i dont know about other sushi eaters but that always shows me that the restaraunt know what they are doing! Finally, the menu is in english and french. I look forward to trying out more sushi here. :D"}
{"text":"We went here for a late lunch based on other yelp reviews. The prices are good and the portions are generous, but the maki rolls are quite bland. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but not 5 star good, maybe more 3 star good. I bump up to 4 star since the other options within 30km are pretty bad."}
