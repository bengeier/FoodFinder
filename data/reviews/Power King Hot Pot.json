{"text":"This was my first time having dry hot pot and I really enjoyed it. I like regular hotpot but this is so much more convenient and filling. There's a lot of options and it's very tasty. I had one of the default options but you can choose your own stuff. The spices and other ingredients make everything taste good. I even enjoyed intestines and other stuff that I wouldnt usually like."}
{"text":"Great service.  Lady at the counter was very polite and helpful.   Explained everything in detail, asked if we wanted mild, medium or hot. Got a big hot pot combo.  Came with variety of ingredient.  Tasted great.    Would definitely visit again for the individual combo meals.  Just wish they are open on weekend as well.    Nice to have this option at the FMP food court."}
{"text":"Oh spicy!  The word \"hot\" in the store name means spicy, not high temperature.  You will love this place if you love spiciness.  I got a noodle soup combo B at medium level of spiciness.  The chef was \"kind\" enough to provide 3 dried chilli for me to munch.  Asides from spiciness, the ingredients were quite fresh.  The fish balls and fish tofu were bouncy to the bite.  A lot of vegetables in the bowl.  In fact, combo A of both the noodle soup and rice plate are vegetarian.  The cashier was friendly. Pricing is average.  Power Kind seems promising.  It provides a new option to an already diversified food court at FMP.  Rating is 3.5 stars.  I up it to 4 stars with hope that it will maintain the current standard."}
{"text":"A much needed addition to the FMP food court especially in this cold winter!   Power King Hot Pot is not your typical hot pot restaurant. Essentially they have a standard spicy broth that they add vegetables and meats to, and you choose your carb (udon, ramen, vermicelli, etc. ). There are many predefined combos which include fish balls, deep fried tofu, seaweed, sausages, black fungus, enoki mushrooms, king oyster mushroom, lotus root, and a lot of other fun hot pot stuff.   You can't really tell what the food booth is really selling unless you go up and check out the menu. There aren't food pictures or price labels on anything really.   The lady at the front is very polite, patient and kind. She carefully explained everything to the best of her ability, and even offered to add more soup broth if it was too spicy. Very courteous and not at all intimidating, as opposed to the other food booths.   The dish was pretty tasty too. A little bit on the oily side, since there's a fair amount of Chili oil. It was a taste that i definitely didn't expect... be warned as it is of the spicy variety! They gave a generous portion of the carb, but could definitely add a little more of the additional toppings/ingredients. Would come back to try a different combo with a different carb, but I do see the taste of the dish getting tiring after a while.   Overall, do give this place a try!"}
