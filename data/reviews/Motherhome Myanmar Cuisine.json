{"text":"This restaurant offers great value for money.  This is good honest food at a very reasonable price.  Could be less greasy though."}
{"text":"Apparently Motherhome makes Burmese Cuisine. Apparently they have an intriguing Menu. Apparently my Friend was SUPER anxious to try that Menu. Apparently this Friend took me there for Lunch. Apparently this Friend didn't do her research. Apparently....  Lunch at Motherhome is pre-cooked Lunch counter specials. For what we had, it was just another regular fill-d-stomach Meal.  2.5'd Owner was friendly almost gave us Steam Rice overdose, we kindly denied.  Spicy Curry Goat with Rice ($5.99) Fish in Tomato Sauce ($7.99)  Apparently \"someone\" needs more thorough research for her future Trips. Let's learn from our experiences shall we?"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here! The staff was really friendly, not sure if he was the owner or not. Recommended to us authentic Burmese food. The best was the fermented tea leaf salad. Really unique, refreshing, and had a nice crunch to it! I would definitely go back for more of this. The fish soup was amazing too. It has noodles inside and comes with different types of toppings you can put on like green onions, parsley, chili flakes etc. The curry was average, nothing special. And the spring rolls was average as well. But the hot sauce that comes with the spring rolls for dipping was divine.   As for the place itself, it was quite clean. You definitely won't classify it as high class, but you'd feel comfortable sitting inside and each table came with a toronto star and toronto life magazines. Alot of people came in and out for takeout from the counter, and several tables had people eating off the menu."}
{"text":"Motherhome seems so out of place in the Bloordale Neighbourhood with it's purple storefront and the food they are serving! The interior is surprising clean, bright and modern.   The set up is more a food court style with hot food already cooked and heating under heat lamp.   Prices are reasonable with a full meal of carb, protein and veggie for $5 taxes in for takeout. In order to eat in, there is a $1 surcharges which we gladly paid.   Spicy Curry Goat with Rice ($5.99) has a nice kick of spice and the meat were quite tender and well flavoured.   Fish in Tomato Sauce ($7.99) was a little disappointing. Maybe because I ate that along side with the curry, I found the sauce was bland. The fish has a lot of sharp little bones inside and it was a little overcooked and dry.   Motherhome also has store made sauces/paste and desserts on sale. I might have to try some of the dessert next time!   The owner that serves us was really polite and friendly, even with all the questions I ask and all the silly request I had!!   They accepts all credit cards!"}
