{"text":"The food?  Delicious (hello Carne Asada!).  The margaraitas?  Awesome.  The prices?  Amazing.  Antonio?  So friendly and helpful, and did I mention friendly?  You gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great family place!  We love Anthony's authentic recipes. Service is fast and friendly. The fresh jalape√±o and regular margaritas should not be missed!  Also love the poblano enchiladas and fish tacos!  Don't be deterred by the semi- hidden location. This place should not be missed!"}
{"text":"Took my first trip to Iguana's for dinner last night.  I'm a big fan of the lunch because it's close to my office in Downtown Concord, so I was anticipating greatness...and I wasn't disappointed.  This time I had the carne asada.  It was tender and flavorful, with just the right amount of char.  It comes with ample portions of the sides you'd expect--warm tortillas, rice, beans, guacamole, pico de gallo, and sour cream.  After dinner, the owner came by our table and told me the secret.  The steak is marinated for 24 hours in a flavorful blend of spices and lime juice.  I might just have a new favorite meal!"}
