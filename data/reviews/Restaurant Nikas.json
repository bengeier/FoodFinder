{"text":"Last few deliveries the quality has been dropping :( our pouting last night had watery gravy with no taste. It was no thicker than a soup. Very disappointed this is the 3rd time the quality has not been great.  Please Nikas get your act together."}

{"text":"How have I lived in NDG for so many years and never managed to go in to this neighbourhood Greek BYOB until today?
Went with my son, we decided to grab an easy lunch so we went with the gyro pita trio (with a drink and fries, $7.50 each).
Great fries, good tzatziki, good gyro meat.    
Nice calm atmosphere, we'll absolutely go back.
They are open 7 days per week from 8 am so one day soon I'll try their breakfast."}
{"text":"I am really wanting to like this place. The first experience was in the restaurant and we shared plates, which was quite worth it. The dish was quite large. 
We just got some takeout and upon arriving home, my sandwich is not what I ordered. It was tiny and I'm still hungry. Not sure I'll eat here again, considering how much bang for your buck you get at boustan..."}
{"text":"J'adore ce resto! La nourriture est fraîche, goûteuse et servie en très bonne quantitée. Le personnel est toujours courtois et très sympathique, les prix sont dans le très raisonnable et l'ambiance est agréable. Un resto tout simple, mais délicieux !"}
{"text":"Ordered a pork pita platter for takeout last night and it was delicious. The fries are amazing! There was not much pork in the pita but the pita it's self-was fluffy and delicious. Will be my go-to greek place."}
{"text":"I have to update again, sorry. But I just ordered delivery from here. A plate (Greek salad, fries, rice) with two chicken souvlakis, and a tatziki. Granted, I live just 5 blocks down the road, the food was ON my plate at home 14min from the time that I called, and it cost $23. Fastest delivery to date by far. I love this place even more now."}
{"text":"It took me awhile to try Nikas when I moved to NDG five years ago however I am SO glad that I did because it is one of my favorite places to get greek food.

Located at 6087 Sherbrooke Ouest, Nikas offers Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.  From 8 AM to 10:30 AM, they have a breakfast special of 2 eggs, home fries, sausage/bacon or ham with fresh fruit, coffee and toast all for just $4.75.  Their menu consists of souvlakis, gyros, club sandwiches, salads, calamari, poutine, burgers, lamb, shrimp, pizzas, subs, veggie pitas, and desserts.  For dinner, bring along your favorite wine to accompany the delicious food.  The atmosphere is casual and very friendly.

Delivery is also free and fast.  When I say fast, I mean that I ordered my food at around 9:35 PM tonight and I had it by 9:50 PM and it still tasted impeccable.  Their staff is always VERY friendly and although I moved and hadn't ordered from there in almost a year (hard to do), I still saw my favorite delivery person who has always been very polite.  Delivery is offered from 11 AM to 10 PM from Sunday to Thursday and 11AM to 11PM Friday and Saturdays with a minimum of an $8 dollar meal before taxes.

I have seen a few reviews that aren't as kind as this but I can honestly say that I have never had a bad experience.  It's a great place to order from if you're really hungry but do not want  to cook"}
{"text":"This restaurant had delicious food at reasonable prices. You can bring your own wine and enjoy their many appetizers while sitting in the terraced area. Great neighbourhood family restaurant."}
