{"text":"Perfect for breakfast, lunch or brunch. Fresh and simple food but omg so delicious! Good pricing too. Legit cappuccinos. Friendly service. Will be coming back often."}
{"text":"Good Turkish tea served in a traditional tea cup with good simit. Tried the original with feta cheese and tomatoes and it was pretty close to authentic. Tried acma with olive paste and that was pretty good as well. Nice treat at Toronto. Turkish coffee served in a Turkish coffee cup hit the spot as well."}
{"text":"Super hip coffee shop in downtown Toronto. Warm atmosphere for cold Toronto winter. Not noisy, so you can actually have a conversation. Yummy Turkish pastries! Great for breakfast or midday snacking :)"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with my husband and two boys, and we all loved it. The menu had just enough options for each of us to find something we would enjoy, and the drink menu was especially exciting. The space was clean and inviting. The sidewalk board advertised the best lemonade in downtown Toronto, but unfortunately they were out (at 9 a.m. on a Tues). My son was excited about lemonade when he saw the sign, but enjoyed his simit and Nutella so much he still voted for 5/5 stars. It was that good!"}
{"text":"Such a lovely spacious cafe where very friendly people serve good simit & coffee & chai."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place 10 stars. 

The first thing you notice is the amazing job the owners did with the look and feel of the place. It's very inviting, cute, and cozy. You could seriously spend the day there drinking and eating away while feeling right at home. 

Next is the perfectly welcoming service! The owners make you feel comfortable and are knowledgeable about their product and the traditions behind all of the food + drink. I let John, one of the owners, decide what I drink and he gave me a delicious tea that I could drink for days. 

Now the food is simply on another level. Everything is so fresh, melts in your mouth, and is done to perfection. The contrasting flavours that pair so well together are just something that you need to go back for - over and over. 

Absolutely overjoyed with this wonderful new addition to the neighborhood. Definitely show them your support and make your belly and soul very happy while doing so. :) :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. A simit is just a round large  bagel with a big hole in the middle and caked in sesame seeds. All their sandwiches seem to rock. Their bathroom is called the thinking room!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast whilst visiting Toronto and was pleasantly surprised to find this place. I got the traditional simit which was excellent and then got a Nutella açma to go. The service was friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was hip. I wish they had a place like this near where I lived because I would go all the time!"}
{"text":"It's a nice little cafe and the coffee and simits are good, but the service could do with being a bit faster. The owners are very friendly and helpful and the place had a nice family feel to it."}
{"text":"Their drinks are decent and their simit is okay!The place itself is not something special although in the picture you feel it looks really beautiful. We couldn't find any seats empty specially and had to go to the park to eat our simits.Their service is not bad, but my friend ordered the pesto Turkey simit and they forgot to put pesto on it and he had noticed when we were at the park 2 blocks away from the cafe. He had to go back to the cafe and they put some pesto on his simit. After my conversations with the owner, he apologized and invited us for lunch Which shows how much he cares about his business and customer service. That's why I'm giving them 4 stars."}
{"text":"Wow so impressed with this café! I visit turkey often and the simits remind me of walking down the streets of Istanbul! Make sure you try them with the cream cheese and olive paste, blew my mind! 

Also, wow the Turkish latte was exquisite. I never thought of having Turkish coffee in a latte form, try it you will definitely not regret it. 

Hope this place expands! It's amazing and the customer service is on point!"}
{"text":"On a stretch of King West otherwise essentially devoid of independent coffee/tea spots, this is a welcome addition. Tried the Street Simit and a Masala Chai latte. Service was quick and friendly and the food flavourful, with generous amounts of cream cheese and olive paste. My first time trying Simit and am a fan- loved the abundance of sesame lending a crispy exterior to the dense and chewy dough. 

The space is comfortable, with high ceilings inside and a few tables outside which are nicely spaced back from the road. Would love to see a few more tables outside/creation of makeshift patio if allowed; very glad this spot has opened up as it provides a low-key, unique place to enjoy a hot beverage and snack/sandwich in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"This place has absolutely delicious drinks and tasty treats. I tried their version of London Fog and  a simit. It's very fresh and you can tell the owners really care about serving good quality and fresh products."}
{"text":"I live Pretty much next door to this Turkish coffee shop. The owners are very nice and will answer any question that you may have. I've had the smoked salmon simit sandwich which is my go to there, their delicious fig and walnut muffins are addicting but a little small for the price, their lattes are delicious and made perfectly and their mini sandwiches are delicious as a snack. I had a chance today to try their turkish coffee which is ground and roasted differently compared to regular coffee which the owner explained to me more indepth. I tried it with their version of a nutella turkish croissant. I was not a huge fan of the turkish croissant as the texture was more of a bread or bagel instead of a delicate pastry like the french croissant. The turkish coffee was full of flavour but I could not get past the grounds on the bottom nor the size of it. You need to stop drinking like 1/4 of the way because of the grounds at the bottom of the cup will end up in your mouth. I prefer the latte or even the americano which I often get."}
{"text":"The staple for me at Simit & Chai is the vegan simit. Loaded with cucumber, fava bean and olive paste, it's reasonably priced for the area at about $6. 

If you like sweets, their ?ekerpare, a dense cookie soaked in honey, is worth trying too.  I love the moist and crumbly texture. As for drinks, I've only had the Istanbul Fog, but the drink felt more standard and was not particularly a standout for me. Either way, this is a comfortable spot with decent food to spend some time at."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try Simit & Chai and finally got around to it over the weekend. As much as I enjoyed my order, I am giving it a lower rating because I didn't feel one of the items on my bill was worth the cost. 

I ordered a Turkish latte with almond milk ($1 for almond milk) and a bagel with a bit of butter on the side. The latte was milky and warm - your usual tasty latte. The bagel was freshly made and you could taste it. For a plain bagel it was $3, which I don't mind spending once in a while for something freshly made. There are options to get it dressed with additional toppings for $6-9 more but that much more for simple ingredients... I figured I'd just get butter because at the end of the day, I'm there for the bagel and it's original flavour. If you think like me, don't get the butter unless you'll don't mind paying $1 for it. A ridiculous price for small containers of butter you get free at Tim Hortons. But if you're willing to pay that, I highly recommend you go all the way and get a fancy bagel. They all looked really good and very insta-worthy."}
{"text":"I have been this place several times with my colleagues. The place is very close to my office and they offer discounts to us. I like this place especially for the Classic Turkish breakfast sandwiches, Muffins, and Turkish latte.  The staff members are amazing and efficient."}
{"text":"I have gotten their turkish simit, although super simple with cucumbers and very small amount of pesto spread , it was quite delicious. I'm super curious to try the smoke  salmon now. 

I also gotten their Turkish fog , its steep tea with milk ,taste very similar to london fog but stronger. 

Overall very cute place but dont expect to be full , i think the simits are a snack more than a lunch IMO, but its a bit pricey which is why its one star down"}
{"text":"I liked the authenticity of the food but not the atmosphere.

This place specializes in Simit which is a traditional Turkish bread that is very similar to a bagel but a bit biger and a bit thinner. Their authenticity comes in with their pairings of salmon , turkey and whatnot with other toppings such as olive paste, basterma meat etc.
You really need to try this place at least once, you won't find anything like it in gta as far as I know.

They have other great drinks on the menu, like the Turkish coffee, Turkish tea, or what I tried was what they called the dirty chai latte which was a spiced masala tea latte. They have other pastries available and some yummilicious deserts.

The tables weren't cleaned for us and it's pretty much self serve, so take it as it is!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy coming here. It's the one place my husband always wants to go to. He enjoys the simit with salmon, olive paste and cream cheese. I enjoy the street with I believe is the cream cheese with olive paste. The prices are a bit high for a bagel and cream cheese but it's good. 
We always get the tea to share. It's a huge pot and they serve with small glasses, it's nice to savor and enjoy especially when it's cold outside. 
The location is a bit away from the busy side of king west but it's still close and lots of residents from the area go there. The decor is simple with exposed bricks and live edge tables. 
It gets busy but there's enough seating for the ongoing traffic.
The only complaint is a few times we went to pick up and they move slow. Like it's not a quick pay and go and their preorder service is no longer available (I forgot the app they used)."}
{"text":"simit is perfect

latte could be better and have more coffee than milk to it.

Nice to see how the bagel has influenced other parts of the world and the diversity our city holds"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! 

I had the vegan bagel which tasted great. I was hesitant because I'm not a fan of Montreal bagels (too hard and dry) but these were not at all. 

The place was also bigger inside than I had imagined based on some other reviews. I've been inside really small coffee shop spaces with hardly any seating but this wasn't the case.

I think they should have more than just a link to write a yelp review on their website."}
{"text":"I had a Irish fog tea. It was alright. As a London fog lover, this was nothing like it. Not as sweet or creamy. 

Next I got vanilla latte. The latte was great. Nice and flavourful.

The staff are friendly. Place is clean and new."}
{"text":"After taking a strong interest in Turkish culture and after a free sampling of their homemade wet chai tea on a fall day, I decided it was a must on a Saturday morning.

I was slightly overwhelmed by the choices of bagels and toppings so I left my selection in the hands of the owner. What I received was a thin round bagel stuffed with cream cheese and olive tapenade, literally served on silver platter- with good reason. It was one of the best bagels I've ever consumed and also a lot more comfortably filling than the thick bagels one is more subject too. Also, the owner suggested a Turkish coffee served in the most beautiful porcelain.  Although, I am a regular to espresso this was no comparison to the bold and strong flavor of the Turkish coffee... it was an \"experience\" that I'm happy was suggested to me. I was so excited and pleased with my meal I had to go back and try a dessert. I settled for baklava, another new food for me. It was delightfully sticky, sweet and crispy and had me licking my fingers at the unusual delicacy. 

I'd recommend going early in the morning on a Saturday before the usual crowd gets there and speak with the employees about the menu and get to know them better. They are informative, very sweet and very passionate. I'm very happy I did because I tried a lot of food I didn't try before without living the familiarity of my neighbourhood."}
{"text":"What I thought I was getting: authentic Indian chai well spiced and simmered.
What I got: watery black tea served by a child. I dislike it when people make their children work for them..unless this is supposed to add to the effect of feeling as if one is in India?"}
{"text":"I went here with my friend and we hadn't had simit in a while. I got the first bite and it tasted like home, the second bite tasted like heaven. This place deserves much more attention, I believe it has a bright future!"}
{"text":"Tasty wheat! A bit too much black olive paste made The Vegan too salty, and the brownie was just a touch dry, but this is nitpicking a really terrific lunch. I'll be back."}
{"text":"While visiting from NYC, went to my sisters local spot and demanded we go everyday during my visit in Toronto. 

This place is really cute, delicious and has super friendly staff. We ordered The Street Simit (cream cheese with olive paste) and a dirty chai tea (shot of espresso added). Both were incredible."}
{"text":"What a find! The simit is lovely and the baklava!!! Wow!!! Just wow! Great service, very clean, bright and pleasing decor. Love the potted plants on the tables and hanging from the ceiling. Will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Fairly new place, great little Turkish coffee shop located near King and Bathursts. I have had the pleasure of trying the their Turkish coffee which has a unique taste from your normal espresso, bitter yet light that it doesn't burden your taste buds. Their simits are to die for, I can eat them all day, I took it with olive paste, cream cheese and salmon. The owner and his wife are amazing people and recognize regulars. If your on the go I recommend their zucchini croquette muffin, its vegan and taste awesome."}
{"text":"Nice people, cool space... Food was okay. Had the smoked salmon, and my other one was the feta and tomatoes. Smoked salmon was better... But found it overall a bit dry. One is enough- I'm just greedy."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's been fun watching it grow. Great hot beverages, and the food (while a tad on the expensive side) is homemade and tasty. If you have't tried a simit - you must. They're a chewy and nutty version of a bagel - with lots of topping combinations. My go-to is a combo of cream cheese and hot red pepper paste.

A great place to sit with friends and catch up, or bring your laptop or book and spend some alone time."}
{"text":"I wanted to check this place out I saw it on yelp and I am not disappointed. The long skinny bagels have great flavour and I had an iced Turkish coffee which paired well with my vegan bagel. This would be an every day stop for me if I lived a little closer. Well worth lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"Family owned, best God damn 'bagels' or simits in the city. Street style with olive paste and cream cheese is so delicious.
Plenty of seating, stroller friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered the turkish house tea and thought it was just decent for a tea...also quite pricey
Friend ordered the turkish coffee and wasnt prepared for it to be so tiny and bitter.. maybe warn customers 0f what theyre ordering first.
Only thing very well done was atmosphere and deccor."}
{"text":"On a cold and rainy Toronto day I found myself day dreaming about chai. Enter: Simit & Chai.

This toasty spot on King Street West is home to a darling Turkish bakery serving sweets like baklava and brownies and savories like simit sandwiches and spreads of sweet red pepper, fava bean and olive. A simit is a thin, round bread ring covered in sesame seeds and often called a Turkish bagel. You can top your simit with the aforementioned spreads plus cold cuts and cheeses.

Simit & Chai also do all manner of coffee beverages. If you're not a coffee person there's still plenty to love here, namely the chai but also the Istanbul Fog! Their nicely spicy masala chai latte is available with regular milk and soy and almond milk are also available."}
{"text":"Delicious, made fresh, wonderful homey customer service, lovely decor... many reasons that I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Pretty happy with this addition to King West eats. Simit is the Turkish version of a bagel and, in my opinion, this version tastes much like the wood oven baked bagels from St Viateur in Montreal, which I love.
I had a sesame seed bagel with cream cheese and olive paste, just amazing. I think I won't always get it with olive paste, as the taste is quite strong, but it's a nice change from the typical cream cheese bagel. Also had a Turkish latte, which is just the Turkish blend coffee in a latte. It's very good.
To finish off, I ordered the custard puffs, which are dressed in their housemade chocolate sauce. I let it sit out a while, as it comes refrigerated. By the time I ate it, the chocolate was a softened and tasted like a rich mousse. Delicious. 
Highly recommend you give this place a try if you're in the area. The decor is rustic and has a very warm and relaxed feeling to it. I'll be back to read a book and enjoy a longer stay next time."}
{"text":"Very friendly atmosphere, you feel like family, simit is traditional, chai/tea are quality and delicious."}
{"text":"Warm and inviting space, wonderful staff and the food...yum.

I had \"The Pro\" with prosciutto, old cheddar and cucumber. 

I devoured and didn't take a pic, but trust me, if you love European style sandwiches, this IS the place!"}
{"text":"Such a great atmosphere with the kind, service oriented owner behind the counter at this bright and welcoming establishment.

I got a simit with cream cheese and one with puréed fava spread, both were excellent and couldn't be fresher. The molasses baking process gives these large, thin and crispy bagels a subtly sweet and wood stove baked flavor that's uniquely pleasing.

In sum it's a pleasure to enjoy delicious homemade food made with obvious generosity and care, and that's what you get at Simit & chai."}
{"text":"Really great spot to grab casual food and tea/coffee! The cafe is somewhat small but has a nice modern interior design. 

The cafe offers simit, a type of bagel, with an array of different fillings. The bagels were delicious and reasonably priced. They also offer some unique drinks, like Turkish coffee and some unique tea drinks, as well as the standard coffee and espresso beverages. 

I ordered the Shakshuka bunch while I was there - I wouldn't consider this a must order but it was decent and filling! 

Would recommend checking this place out but wouldn't go completely out of my way to visit!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Turkish coffee, i tried the latte and numerous treats. The brownie was the best consistency, fudgy and chewy on the inside a bit crispy at the edges. The muffin and sandwich were good too! Everything tastes homemade and fresh and the owners come by to check on you to make sure you are enjoying. Next time i have to try the Simit and Chai"}
{"text":"A very quaint little Turkish inspired coffee shop on King West. They specialize in simits, which are essentially Turkish styled bagels, dipped in molasses and doused in sesame seeds. I'm not familiar with the dish so can't say if it's authentic or not, but it was definitely very tasty! You can have your simit with a variety of different options, mine I got the smoked salmon with cream cheese and greens. The ingredients are very fresh and I believe mostly made in house. The cream cheese was just spectacular. They also serve a variety of hot drinks, in line with the Turkish theme. I had the Turkish latte, which I thought was alright. Great experience overall, only thing I would say is that it was a little pricey. My latte plus the simit was a total $14."}
{"text":"If you don't know what Simit is (or Gjevrek) feel free to overpay here to find out.  Back home the Simit is the cheapest street food you buy from street vendors and mostly poor people eat it. Here a \"hamster\" costs $12.  For what ? Some dough and a few pieces of ham? Seriously ???

It tastes ok, but the originals back home are bigger, better and cheaper.  I am allergic to coffee so no tea or latte for me. There's no such thing as Turkish latte in Turkey, only Turkish coffee (thick, unfiltered ). I had a can of mango juice for $3.50, the very same ones from Costco that cost $12 for a pack of 20. 

Enjoy hipsters!"}
{"text":"4.5/5.

A gem in \"West King West\" which is a bit spotty in terms of good local businesses. This place ticks off all the right boxes: friendly service, tasty food, unusual coffee and tea beverages, and an interior space that feels chic yet unpretentious. I've yet to try any of their hot dishes, but they all look great as they pass me by!"}
{"text":"So I visited this place today after a co worker brought in the bagels and I'm so glad we did! We had the simit with cream cheese and olive paste, and took 6 home with us. They were warm hot out of the oven and the super nice lady not only brought them to the car but also gave mea free sample of baklava to try! Definitely better than any bagel I've had, including the Fairmount in Montreal! Great find!"}
{"text":"Was stoked to be able to finally try out some Turkish coffee since I've read it was prepared quite differently than Western techniques. 

Now the coffee--not sure if we ordered the wrong thing, but the Turkish latte was just a tasteless milk liquid with no traces of caffeine! Perhaps we should have gone with Turkish coffee instead, but the latte should not taste that awful (couldn't finish it). 

Although disappointment was met, the spinach pastry was quite tasty. May return to give it a second shot just for the Turkish coffee."}
{"text":"Awesome little coffeeshop in King West! Great tea, coffee and traditional Turkish bagels with many different fixings! Also the owners are really lovely people, which makes me want to support this little mom'n'pop café even more."}
{"text":"Such a great environment for a peaceful breakfast. The Simit are awesome and the coffee is delicious."}
{"text":"One of the best bagels and Shashuka I ever had.  The turkish cafe and Latte were also great. A bit on pricy side but well worth it. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I really like the vibe of this place. The terrariums and the music are always great. 
The menu is interesting. They have classic things you want at a coffee shop but with a fun twist. Items you wouldn't find in other coffee shops. I did feel the portions weren't as big as I would like for the price but everything did seem very fresh and the people were friendly who worked there"}
{"text":"Great food! Great drinks! Lovely atmosphere. 

Service was also really good. 

They have a vegan option, which is why I chose to come here for a quick breakfast. The inside is nicely decorated, with a very modern cafe vibe. There are a variety of tables, but they seem like they are always full. It's better to prepare to grab your food to go if you come during busy hours. 

Drinks are good too. They also offer vegan milk options. 

Overall, great place. I'd definitely come back here if in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Tasty spot. Some things are hit or miss. They were pretty busy on the weekend morning I visited. I loved one of the soft pastries I ordered...sh#t! It was sooooooo soft...how did they do it? Other things like the tea cookies were way too sweet for me. The huge sandwich bagel that's all over the Yelp pix...it was good, but not worth the trip I made for it. I like their Turkish influence and could see others from Turkey inside as it seems a bit of a cultural spot. Their WiFi didn't work and you need a key with an enormous keychain to use the bathroom. Interior is cute and inviting; however, grab a table if you can! I'd stop in for that pastry if I was in the area, but wouldn't make a trip unless I was longing for a Turkey-inspired cafe!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite coffee shops in Toronto! Vibes were great here. The person behind the counter was really friendly and explained to me what Turkish coffee was and what the special Turkish bakery items were. I got a Turkish latte and shared the shakshuka and a couple simits with my group, all of which were very yummy. I'm definitely coming back. Felt like a good place to do work (they have free WiFi too) or maybe next time I'll bring a book."}
{"text":"Love, love this place.
Super cute and a great vibe for studying. The food is great and the coffee is great too. Best vibe I love this little cafe!"}
{"text":"Although it's a 3 star but the friendly service was a 5 star! I've grown on Simit, so I can't comment on it, as it's not fair to compare the simit here to the one of Turkey's. but overall I say the simit wasn't bad and definitely fun to eat especially for those who haven't tried simit before. I enjoyed both dishes, my fav was the cream cheese with tomato and cucumber, it was great! The one with roasted red pepper and avocado spread, wasn't my most fav because I think the roasted red pepper was store bought and I was not crazy about it. The atmosphere and service was good, but the only disappointment was the masala chai... it was toooo watery and flavorless and not worth the price.... it was so watered down my friend couldn't event have more than one sip. I even added a bit of cream to give it some body, but it was just fake watered down, takes masala chai.... the real one has to have some body. That was a waste of money but everything else was good."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I tried this place out! Definitely worth the drive during the morning rush hour. Tea was steeped, authentic and aromatic just how we middle easterns like it. Simit was fresh and the perfectly salted, reminiscent of my days in Istanbul.

I can now happily check this place off my Toronto bookmarks list."}
{"text":"Such a cozy place, with just the right temperature and aroma in the air..

I eyed their goodies but ordered their Shakshouka (poached eggs, turmeric, tomatoes) I added pastrami to the mix which took me to the moon and back (-;

It is served all day under their brunch menu..Yum!

Exposed brick walls, great music in the background, who needs a living room anymore...walk out the steel tall buildings and step into this heavenly space!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable. Decor is lovely; very simple and neat, lots of space.

When ? saw the menu, my mouth started to water seeing the word \"simit.\"

? have not been able to find a good and decent simit place in Toronto.

But here? ?t was amazing. 

We ordered to go, to take back to the office. We waited awhile, other people behind us in line recieved their simits before we did.

4 stars for the simit. ? gave a minus 1 becuase of how unhappy the staff were. Except for the girl with the blue lipstick taking orders, she was so happy and friendly, chatting up customers. Everyone else? Cranky.

Perhaps they didn't have their turkish coffee in the morning..."}
{"text":"Happened to walk by this place and decided to stop back the following day after reading reviews about it. My wife and I both tried a different simit, one of their specialty items and a Turkish coffee. Everything was delicious. First time I had a Turkish coffee, unsure of how much I enjoyed that, but it's no reflection of how it was prepared. The people were very nice and also welcoming."}
{"text":"Craftfully prepared bagels with a wonderous ambiance. Strong focus on healthy and tasteful food options - so happy to see Turkish coffee and Masala chai among the beverage menu, and many forms of cream cheese simit (bagel) among the food menu. Love at first sight. Perfect place to get work done, take a friend or date, or to escape for a small while. 5/5"}
{"text":"Stopped in as this spot is so close to my condo! Ibe had a few Simit sandwiches and both Boureks and a few teas. The simits are good, nutty and chewy, though I have to say they feel overpriced for what you get. While I love the vibe and the culture, it seems to be a tad excessive for what is on your plate. My friend and I ordered two Simit sandwiches two baked goods and WITHOUT drinks that day it was over $40. A little much for a quick breakfast snack. 
But the quality is nice and it is different which is lovely."}
{"text":"After reading the super positive reviews of Simit & Chai, I was looking forward to coming here and purposely went out of my way to try their chai.  I'm not sure what happened or even if the people changed.  It seems like Lisa S also tried within 2 weeks and experienced a disappointment as well.

I love Chai ... ever since my discovery of them in New Delhi and Dubai, I've been thrilled to find different variations around the world.  When Simit and Chai opened, I had it bookmarked forever.  I am never in this area of King St so I had to make the trek out.  The cafe is a decent size and has a lot of small and shared tables for you to sit.  It also have a few cute 2 seaters outside to enjoy the sun if you want.  

Their service here is polite and quiet.  They had one person taking the orders and cash while 2 others were in the back making the food.  Their menu has their bagels with various toppings, some in house baked goods, and their drink menu.  

Chai latte with almond milk -  When we got the cups, I was shocked at the size.  I ordered a large for $6 (with almond milk) and what arrived was a cereal bowl sized drink.  Generous ... yes perhaps but thats when I realized their mistake.  With such a large cup, you need a lot of tea to overcome the amount of water and milk in it.  This was a cup of heated diluted almond milk.  Even with the extra shakes of cinnamon, it could not change the flavour of watery milk.  What a disappointment as I was hoping for bold flavour and spices.  There was no black tea flavour or any spices.  I think I'll stick to Plentea and Chaiwalla Chai from here on in.  We only drank maybe 5 sips before giving up.  1/5

Turkish cappuccino -  Another casualty of a big cup and not understanding flavours need to hold its ground to a lot of water and milk.  Similar problem to the chai latte, we got an expensive cup of super watered down coffee.  It did have a tiny bit more flavour than the chai latte but this was extremely watery.  Normally in the middle east, you can taste the cardamom in the coffee but this... I could barely even taste coffee.  I think for Middle Eastern coffee, I will go back to Souk Tabule.  There you have good flavour even if it is a latte.  Definitely too expensive for hot watery coffee.  1/5

Baklava - Made in house, I was surprised when it arrived to the table.  For $2.50 the piece of baklava was only 1 inch squares.  I remember the in house made baklava at Baklava King and even then you can share the piece for maybe 2 bites each.  This single piece was a morsel.  As for flavour, you could taste the pistachios and walnuts but the syrup was not evenly distributed.  Even in the single bite I had, there was so super dried out phyllo pieces while others were properly drenched.  Good flavour but too small and not the best execution. 3/5

I do have to warn people.. DO NOT USE THE BATHROOM.  It is atrocious.  I dont want to be graphic but the brown stains and terrible conditions of dirt everywhere in there was a shock.  It needs a good bleaching for a few hours.

I'm not sure if they raised prices, lowered quality, or have new staff... but the Simit & Chai I experienced is not the same as others has written.  It's unfortunate but I'm hoping this is read and lessons learned to improve."}
{"text":"I've always heard about Turkish bagels and have wanted to try them so I'm very happy that we finally have our very own Turkish cafe in Toronto.

I got the classic bagel with cream cheese and tomato. My perfect bagel is described as being crispy with a whole bunch of seeds on top and that is exactly what I got! The texture and freshness is really what makes these bagels delicious.

On to the drinks..... I was really disappointed with my Istanbul Fog chai. It tasted like frothy milk. I was hoping for a slight hint of flavour somewhere.

The cute interior and funny signage made the cafe very comfortable to be in. I'd love to bring my laptop in to sit there and catch up on work!"}
{"text":"As a hungry, hungry girl (and boy) we were getting a bit impatient waiting for our order but everything was delicious, filling and made with care we forgot about the wait! We ordered the Poseidon, Original (I think) and two Turkish coffees. Delicious...I don't think you can go wrong ordering here.

Beautiful space, generous portions, kind staff, and delicious food. Perfect place for a breakfast date, friendly meeting or quiet workspace. The decor is really calming.

The steel plates gave me a good dose of nostalgia.

P.S. John's beard is glorious!"}
{"text":"It was a wonderful experience and the simit was as good as the ones in Turkey. The staff was very friendly. I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I got the chia pudding there today.. not sure if it's supposed to like this and it tasted sour like it had gone bad. I didn't feel comfortable eating it so I decided to throw it out :(. i feel bad writing this because the staff were very nice."}
{"text":"I love this neighbourhood bakery and coffee shop. All of the baked goods I've sampled (the date square, the spinach feta wheel, the simit) have been excellent and the coffee is on point. The owners are lovely and provide warm and friendly service. A very authentic Turkish experience in the middle of king west!"}
{"text":"I was taken here by my Turkish friend after him raving about it for a week. Once I finally got to try Simit & Chai I can see what all the buzz was about. 

I tried several kinds of simit(Turkish bagel) that day including cream cheese simit, Nutella simit, and smoked salmon simit. My favourite was the smoked Salmon. It was very filling and very fresh! The Turkish coffee is very bitter and authentic. 

All the food is freshly made by the couple who owns the cafe. The couple told me that if they can't actually make the food or desserts then they will not sell it. 

The decor was very cool and simple! I definitely plan to go back and just relax there!"}
{"text":"Maybe better boreks than the ones in Istanbul. I really loved it. Simits and Turkish tea is also good. I wish I lived in Toronto and eat breakfast every morning here :)"}
{"text":"Great traditional Turkish Simit!!! Friendly atmosphere and great service. Definitely a must try for a light breakfast, afternoon snack or meeting spot for friends or business meet ups. From plain sim its, to mini Turkish sandwiches to lovely beverages, Simit and Chai has it."}
{"text":"I've never had a simit before so was quite curious to try one out! It was explained to me that a simit is the Turkish version of a bagel and is considered fast food, sound good so far?

The interior of Simit & Chai was so spacious and clean, great place to grab a bite and sit down and work! Lots of options for your simit so I decided to grab the Street Simit and a cup of Chai latte - just wanted to try what they were actually named after.

The Street Simit ($5) was filled with cream cheese and olive paste. Not a fan of actual olives itself, the olive paste was actually quite light and paired well with the cream cheese! Turns out a simit is like a skinny bagel - I like this a lot more than regular bagels because it's easier and cleaner to eat and great for portion control. Don't be fooled though, I was quite full after my Street Simit!

The chai latte was a bit disappointing... The milk to chai ratio was a bit high, I would've liked more chai in it to give it a kick since it mostly tasted like warm milk with a hint of Chai.

Overall, great place to grab a quick bite and do some work. Going to come back and try other simits (maybe a simit with Nutella?) and perhaps their Istanbul fog or a green tea latte. Stay tuned for more :)"}
{"text":"I had a cappuccino and one of the feta bread rolls. The bread rolls were very good. They also came around and offered some samples which was nice. The cappuccino could have been better though, a bit too much milk for my taste. Staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"I've frequented this place several times. It has seats so you can do some work as well. It's not noisy which is great because you can actually have a conversation!
I only get the same thing: vegan simit. I only wish they had more vegan options (they have some vegan treats, but not food).
Staff is friendly and efficient."}
