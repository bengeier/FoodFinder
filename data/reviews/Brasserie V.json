{"text":"I had been hearing good things about this place, most importantly: the frites.  I've known some good frite:  I used to work 5 blocks away from pomme frites in NYC and have basically tried all their toppings.  

I love the fact that it's a stone's throw from the trader joe's and the neighborhood is precious.  The pedestrian walks have flags you can pick up and drop that you can use to cross the streets; parades can happen ANYWHERE.  

So, we went after 1ish and it wasn't too packed but noticed there were only two servers.  We weren't in a rush so I thought it would be fine. We ordered and since the husband, whose first love in potato, wouldn't share, we each got an order of frites.  Husband ordered the cheeseburger, our friend Kate got the reuben and I got the avocado BLT.  

And then we waited, and waited.  I had to order coffee or else I was going to pass out.  I had just finished a hip hop class so I was starving.  Their beer selection was impressive, with husband pointing out that they serve Wychwood beer, from his hometown in the UK.

When we finally got our orders, I noticed the portion of frites were huge and regretted not sharing them with Kate.  I also noticed that a) husband said no tomato and look! tomato and b) the avocado was missing from my AVOCADO BLT.  It took some time to flag the waitress and then she apologizes and brings a plate of sliced avocado for me.  I was like, 'um, great, i get to assemble my own sandwich'.  I drowned out my grumpiness in frites doused in mayo, because fat makes everything okay.

We felt guilty because we over heard the waitress tell a table that they had run out of frites.  We had ordered the last ones.  But then I thought, hello? it's your signature dish--how can you run out?

Anyway...I would try it again and see how the dinner menu goes and taste their booze.  The food was pretty tasty, the service, not so much."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, especially the moules frites. Arguably better than what I had in Belgium. The beer selection is good (considering that I just got back from Belgium yesterday, this is a compliment).

The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about Belgian ales. They helped my wife and I learn the ropes and build our Belgian ale vocabulary. They also helped us plan our time in Belgium with tips on where to go, what to see and what to try.

B5 is first on my list of where to go for authentic Belgian food and beer, beating out Chicago contender Hopleaf."}
{"text":"Yum! Brasserie V is definitely an exciting new option for me!

We spent some time waiting for a table at the bar. What an incredible beer menu! I mean, dang! Luckily, server Josh was there to guide my dining companions and I. I definitely look forward to going back just to try more! Oh, and half off beers on Thursdays.

On to food... Apple Swiss sandwich was good, but not as great as similar sandwiches I've had in Madison, like Graze's Farmer John. Frites with garlic aioli were freakin' delicious!

One of my companions had the three daily sliders, which were all very good- juicy, flavorful, with well-curated toppings.

The other had the turkey sandwich, which she wasn't wild about. It had pretty slippery ingredients, which made it a little tough to eat.

Service was slow-ish, but it was a pretty busy night, and we weren't in a rush.

Overall, I look forward to going back and trying some more beers and foods!"}
{"text":"This place has a really hip, cool vibe. This is another restaurant where I would definitely recommend going early (!!) or a weekday, it can get super packed with a 3+  hour wait time quoted to me one weekend.

I don't drink beer, but it seems to me that they have a very nice selection of different (mostly foreign) beers available, along with cidre and wine. I would be perfectly happy to just sit at the bar with some cidre and frites + aoili. The V burger and chicken paillard were pretty good too. The croque monsieur was not my favorite, very greasy, and I could tell it had been sitting for a while waiting for my companion's plate, since the cheese had already congealed and it was barely warm by the time I got it.

Service is pretty good. Also be aware that they don't take Discover, thankfully my companion had a different card to cover the bill."}
{"text":"The smoked turkey was simply one of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever eaten. All the flavors, from the avocado schmear to the lime-chipotle aioli, balance perfectly and transport you to smoky zen.  I was not a fan of the asparagus+artichoke+tomato mishmash served on the side (mealy tomatoes, generally flavorless), but I just left that alone and gave my undivided attention to the sandwich."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be so much more! It's still a good place for a drink, but the food is mediocre and overpriced.  Had the croque monsieur and I won't be ordering that again.  The frites need work.  Unfortunately, I won't be eating here again unless the quality of the food improves."}
{"text":"The food at Brasserie V is generally good, but service is hit-or-miss, which means your meal may be lukewarm by the time it reaches your table. Being with a group of four or more exacerbates the problem. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the BBQ Pulled Pork ($9) and the Grilled Chicken & Blue ($8.50) sandwiches I had for lunch on two separate occasions. If you're there for Sunday Brunch, try the 4-Layer Crepe with Nutella ($9) or the Smoked Salmon Benedict ($10) with a cup of perfectly brewed Alterra coffee.  Note that portions tend to be on the light side."}
{"text":"I seem to have a thing for picking small, packed restaurants to try on Friday nights...

We waited for over an hour, as we were told we would. Since we were at the bar, it was completely fine. As everyone else has said, the beer list was almost overwhelmingly long. I can't make decisions, ever, so I went with (overpriced) Riesling. It was delish. An odd thing though: I guess they reserve seats at the bar, because once a couple got up and we slid in to grab their seats, the bartender informed us that they were taken and reserved. Hmm.

At the table, we got the V Burger I, V Burger II, and 2 orders of moules frites, plus the pommes frites as appetizers. The garlicky aioli was amazing... the pesto aioli was slightly odd with the fries but still good. My friends ate their burgers in .02 minutes -- evidently they were tasty. The mussels were also very good, although slightly bland. I got ginger-pear fritters with creme anglaise for dessert, which was very very fried and heavy. Not my favorite. We also got the chocolate pie, and this won our hearts. Thick, dark chocolate creaminess on top of a cookie crust. What could be better?

3 starts because although the wait was long, the staff was friendly and helpful, the food was quick once we sat down, and the bar kept us busy through the whole wait. But... the dessert was such a disappointment.  I would try it again, maybe with just one other person."}
{"text":"My first meal in Wisconsin, it was awesome. I had the V Burger with bacon jelly. I live in Northern Colorado and Wyoming (beef country) and I am humbled to say, these guys make the best burger I've ever had. Absolutely awesome. And the cheese was awesome too :)"}
{"text":"The service was mediocre. Unfortunately, no real excitement over the beer or wine offerings from the staff. The menu looked good for appetizers, but nothing much beyond that."}
{"text":"Beer. beer, beer, beer, beer, beer.  

That's what this place is all about.  Well, they have food as well, but you should definitely visit for the beer. 

The tap list seems endless! I know nothing about beer, so you probably shouldn't take my advice if I say go here for great beer, but they have so many options that it would be impossible to not find a beer that you enjoy.  

I love the Avocado B.L.T. and they have great burgers, too.  So, if you're not into beer, you should definitely check those menu items out.  Not into eating meat?  The frites are delicious!

One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the personal record-listening booth that they have near the back bar.  You can bring in your own records and sip on some unique beers while listening to your favorite album.  So cool!"}
{"text":"We love the hundreds of beer choices here!  Truly something for everyone. The food is creative and the menu changes periodically. I tried the carbonade flamande during our latest visit and while the meat was delicious, it was also fairly fatty. I had to keep trimming the fat off the meat pieces throughout the meal. Otherwise the flavor was yummy. 

My partner had a burger and the meat was delicious!  We paid the extra $2.50 to have the frites as a side, but I'm not sure it was worth it. Overall we enjoy the atmosphere, beer and food at this cozy restaurant. Especially the beer..."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here today. 5 stars for Ahi Tuna sandwich with a side of curry salad.  May have to go back tomorrow."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood restaurant at it's best. Great food, ambience, and service. The expansion means seating and space are rarely an issue, yet they have maintained their high standards. One of our favorite venues in Madison."}
{"text":"This establishment has a great beer selection and friendly bartenders that will help you decide which beer fits your tastes. You can't really go wrong though. For those unfamiliar with the stronger Belgian beers, I recommend sticking with the blond and witbiers.

The place is small if you're looking to dine, and they don't do reservations. However, the bar is always happy to serve drinks while you're waiting. The people in the restaurant are nice, and the bar is the place to have friendly banter with people.

The food itself is good, but not amazing, given the more expensive price. If you're a fan of frites (fancy fries), get the truffle frites. It comes with a couple gourmet sauces that make it an appetizer worth getting. The burgers are good and hearty. The salads are fresh. 

Overall, I would probably come back if someone brought it up, but it's not my go to."}
{"text":"Wonderful place! Great menu and our food has always been well prepared. Nice selection of drinks too. This is a really nice dinner spot but also fun for a quick drink and catch up at the bar!"}
{"text":"A must for Belgian beer lovers. Astounding beer selection with many beers that are difficult to find outside Belgium. No stupid pint glasses. Gastro-pub style food was delicious and well prepared."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm in love with a restaurant. We came for the impressive selection of Belgian Ales and were utterly amazed by the food."}
{"text":"We have been great fans of \"V\" for several years.  However, we came in mid-afternoon a couple of Thursdays ago and were grossly disappointed.  We didn't have a lot to eat, just some moules frites, which were still excellent, and some horrible fries, which were not.  Wife thinks the whole place was insolent and cynical.  The sign proclaiming their fries the best in Madison was staring us in the face as we were served some of the limpest, most execrable,  examples available.  Pay attention to your business and stop making claims you can't back up.  Wife comes for the fries, and she was grossly disappointed.  Two more customers down the drain."}
{"text":"I really love this place. I work with a lot of people who travel to Madison and whenever they're looking for a good place for dinner I start by asking a simple question - \"Do you like beer?\" If they say yes, I immediately tell them that they should check out Brasserie V. It's got the best beer selection in Madison and probably the best beer selection of any restaurant I've been to. I also really dig the atmosphere. It's a small, typically crowded restaurant/bar that feels casual and comfortable with good food and great drinks. What's not to like???"}
{"text":"Great beer, great food, service was very kind. When I asked to test a tap-beer I'd never had the server was more than happy to oblige. Definitely recommend this particularly if you are a fan of Belgium ales."}
{"text":"Excellent and unusual  beer selection  Fantastic mussels, the best I've ever had!  Will visit again next time in Madison."}
{"text":"Their truffle frites! It's delicious! I couldn't stop eating. 4 stars!

Pretty impressive selection of beer. 

As for my steak, I thought it was mediocre. It was oddly geometric in shape which turned me off.  3 stars. Try something else."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but very slow. I went for lunch today and it took a very long time for 3 sandwiches and soups. I would not bother going again."}
{"text":"This is the second time we visited and the first time since they've expanded into the space next door.  My wife and son and I were at an activity Friday night and stopped in for a late dinner around 9pm.  We were quoted a 30 minute wait and said ok because Brocah was packed.  We had a drink and were seated in around 20 minutes-not bad.

We ordered the soup of the day-a spicy carrot soup- that the waitress raved about.  It was fair at best.  Luke warm and not very flavorful-certainly not spicy. We started with some frites that were great and gobbled up. 

 I ordered the beef stew (Carbonnade Flamande) and my wife got the trout.  My beef stew had about 5 dry, unseasoned chunks of meat in it with some red potatoes that were undercooked in a broth that looked and tasted like water and beef boullion.  

My wife's trout was about a 3 oz. piece that also had no seasoning on top of hard lentils with no sauce.  Luckily my son gave me a bite of his mini burger that was pretty good.  I already had a beer and some wine so we asked for the check and paid our $77.00 tab.

Bottom line: Go if you enjoy Belgium beer and stick with the burger and frites."}
{"text":"Visiting Madison, my friend took me there because of its reputation for a outstanding selection of Belgian tap beers. The beer menu offers a lot to try out and explore. The friendly staff allows you to sample them if you are not sure what to order or want to compare. 
The interiour design comes close to an authentic brasserie atmosphere. Open kitchen in the back makes it lively. 

I've not experienced any rude service as in the review above. Unfortunately we didn't get to check out the menu or try the food, since the wine and beer list was already consuming our full attention.   

Within Europe, Belgium has propably the highest density of top restaurants and certainly the biggest variety of beers. Madison can be very proud to this little Belgian embassy!!!

Brasserie V definitely deserves 5 stars for  taking the risk and creating this great contribution to Monroe street!"}
{"text":"Visiting the Brasserie V after about 2 weeks after its opening, and then about 2 months later, one word jumped into my head immediately.  Inconsistent.

The service and especially the food wavered in quality and delivery.  Starting with the first visit, I was taken as a surprise with the place still in its infancy, mellow, feeling as if word of its existence hadn't really gotten out yet.  Upon returning those several months later the place had become lit darker, much louder (due to the fact it was packed) and complete with a long wait as there are few tables.

Now I'm not one to complain about noise, nor about having to wait, but it is truly loud inside for a small restaurant, and if your host informs you its only a fifteen minute wait and it turns out to be more around double don't continually string them along telling them, \"Just a few more minutes.\"  Recall what you told those waiting and address the fact you were mistaken, otherwise gauge more time than you think it will take.  Telling groups their wait time is low, only for it to be over double starts a sour note before menus are even in hand.  Unfortunately, the minimal wait space inside does little to help those table-less.

Okay, now before I begin spilling out one of those prototypical long tirades complaining about rude wait staff, undercooked orders, and long wait times perhaps the best way for me to reflect may this tried and true form.

The Good: Their more affordably charged sandwiches were the highlight item each time, I recommend the one with mustard.  I actually don't like mustard but this was very rich without being overbearing, very close to amazing.  A very nice Belgian beer selection, although a bit expensive, one of these won't kill you, and if the place isn't completely  jammed and the bald man at the bar is feeling nice he can help point you in the right direction if you're feeling overwhelmed.  

The Bad: The much hyped frites are simply thinly cut fries, slice and dice it how you will, because sliced and diced they are still fried potatoes and not a lot more.  The tri cups of dipping sauce that accompany seem to exist to enliven these knowingly dull snacks but they should be more flavorful or evolved.  Besides the above mentioned wait-times, the servers seemed very distant and non-communicative, while not rude, when in a loud restaurant the server should assert themselves over the noise letting you know you're of value and you're noticed.  Sometimes when feeling swallowed up the lack of server presence is much more estranging than typically felt.

The Ugly:  Upon both visits, the lamb was ordered and requested beforehand to be cooked more than rare.  Both times returning marginally more than rare, causing two send backs the second time.  Above all, get the meat cooking instructions correct.  For whatever reason of confusion, this looks extremely unprofessional. 

I'm going to give the Brasserie a pass here, in memory of the better food and experience I had the first time and hope that as time goes by they can tighten up some of these hitches.  You can see the potential for it to really sail and just soar but for the ambiance and the dollar its dangling between disaster and dazzle."}
{"text":"The food is poorly prepared.  The beer is good, the kitchen needs a makeover.  I've dined here twice in the past week, and have had extremely underwhelming fare each visit.  A sandwich:  dry bread drenched in mayonnaise with possibly the world's most overcooked bacon.  The soup:  thin, entirely without body or flavor, with a hint of cinnamon.  The duck:  every last bit of character was cooked out of this unfortunate creature----quite possibly the most overcooked piece of meat ever served at a dining table."}
{"text":"Love this place minus the fact that it is freezing and drafty. I never eat at Brasserie V in winter because of that."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great beer selection. Had the duck & best ever I order duck where ever I can find it all over the world. Beer sampler good if your not familiar with the HUGE beer menu. A little noisy when full but not over bering."}
{"text":"Bravo! Done right from top to bottom...great beer, frites, organic and local meats! Friendly and competent service and cool upscale atmosphere. A bit noisy but one of my favorite places in Madison."}
{"text":"Very nice space, and food was good, but far too expensive. Dropped $20 on one 10 oz beer and one glass of wine. Ordered ravioli for dinner and was served 5 lonely raviolis (raviolii?) for $17. No sides. No bread.  Still hungry. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great choice of Belgian biers but anyone who's ever been to Belgium wouldn't be overwhelmed by the frites.  Overdone and soggy every time I've been there.  And the dipping sauce?  Where's the mayo??"}
{"text":"Best gastropub in Madison, by far.

Brasserie V is one of those places that (to my taste) just gets everything right.  Great craft beer selection, but with a focus on Belgians. Excellent, locally sourced food, with the menu updated seasonally.  

Their double fried frites are the best in town.

The menu does change seasonally, but there are some popular staple items that are left untouched, mainly steak frites and the moules frites, along with a selection of sandwiches. Almost all of which I've tried by this point, and I've yet to have a bad meal here. As other reviewers have mentioned, this place set a new bar for what I think a burger can be. The V Burger is definitely the best  burger I've had in my life thus far. Hopefully something I will continue to experience in the afterlife, as it tastes like heaven.  (hint: it's likely the combo of the burger juices that mix in with the aioli that take this burger to the next level) . Their cheese boards are a great cross-section of primarily Wisconsin produced cheeses.

I would argue that Chef Rob is one of the best chefs in Madison, as to an amateur observer, what comes out of the kitchen is always very consistent, and nearly always perfectly prepared - even if Chef Rob himself is not in the kitchen. To me that means that all of the kitchen staff actually care and want to succeed in making good food. That makes a lot of difference!

The service is generally very friendly and attentive. And although I've had some slow service when they are quite busy, I can understand that. Slow service certainly isn't the norm though, so no points lost from me.  

Expect to wait for a table during peak hours, sometimes up to an hour or more, as the place is absolutely tiny. I have no problem waiting for anything from here though, it's made up for in the quality and deliciousness of the beer and food on offer.  My tip? Sit at the bar if it's busy. Or, if you have a long wait, put your name on the list and go grab a beer or glass of wine at Barrique's Wine Cave while you wait.

It's also not uncommon to see Matt the owner tending bar during dinner hours and socializing. He's a very nice guy and passionate about beer. A great fountain of knowledge.

They also occasionally offer up beer tastings and educational sessions where you can learn about beer. I've attended a couple of these and had a fantastic time learning about the origins of some of their european and belgian beers. 

The lunch menu is a bit more limited, and provides mostly their salads and sandwiches, but there is typically a good special on offer.

One reviewer mentioned they only have the lunch menu Sunday nights. This recently changed, and they now have the full menu available on Sunday evenings.


So, my crib notes:
- Expect to wait to be seated, especially during peak hours. (solution: eat at the bar, or just drink excellent beer while you wait)
- Expect your food and libations to be most excellent, no matter what you order.
- Expect good to excellent service."}
{"text":"Even with a loaded wallet I couldn't get good service here on a slow night. Severely unimpressed with the service and the overpriced beer."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place pretty regularly since I moved here 4 years ago. I mostly come here for the drinks; their beer list is out of this world. I think I owe my current love of beer (certainly my love of sours) to living a block from this restaurant and exploring their extensive (and ever changing) beer list for the past two years. Now they offer 4oz pours from their tap list in addition to full size, which is great for the indecisive among us. For non-beer drinkers the wine menu has never disappointed either.

I can't speak for the entrees, but have enjoyed the porcini fries and v-burger several times. I'm still bitter they removed my favorite sandwich (I miss you caprese sandwich!!) but the turkey sandwich is another solid choice.

Basically, if you like beer, you've gotta check it out."}
{"text":"SUPPOSEDLY we've got a new 5 star restaurant in Town that would rival any big city. However, I wouldn't know this. I've tried four times now to get a meal at this place. They don't take reservations, and so every time we've gone, there has been about 1 1/2 to 2 hours of waiting. I get that this is a restaurant that is increasing popularity, but what's the point of all the good press and all the blogs if no one can ever get in to try the food?  I'd like to try again (a 5th time), because of all I've read, but it may not happen as my fiancé is over it by now.  So it may be a solo trip."}
{"text":"The beer was good, as were the truffle frites, but unfortunately the awful service kept me from experiencing the actual meals, and ruined the whole experience.

My girlfriend and I were having awful days, so we decided to treat ourselves and go to a nice restaurant. We both like beer, so this place seemed perfect. We came in and were told we would need to wait 20-30 minutes for a table and to sit at the bar in the mean time. Perfectly reasonable. 

We sat at the bar, and had some good beer. The main two we were interested in from their board were not actually on tap anymore, which was irritating, but hey it happens.

Thirty or so minutes later, there's still no sign of us getting a table. I was sitting in plain view of the hostess, so I assumed she would let us know as soon as one was available. I ordered some truffle frites so we wouldn't be drinking on empty stomaches. They were delicious.

Fifteen or twenty more minutes pass and my girlfriend notices an open table, so I go ask the hostess when we're going to be seated. She says that she had been looking for me but thought that I was a different guy in a blue shirt. She had my name and was standing ten feet from me the whole time. I was later told that she was new, which makes me think that she probably shouldn't have been thrown into one of the most important roles in the restaurant without any sort of assistance.

We finally get a table and are really hungry and a little pissed. Five or so minutes pass without any sign of a waitress, but a bartender did come over and say we had to close out at the bar before moving to a table. We finished our beers and frites, closed out the bar tab, and the waitress shows up to give us some water just as we decide that we're going to just leave and get some food somewhere else. There was no apology or offer to take something off of our tab. 

The beer was good and I'm sure the food would have been as well, but the best food in the world is worth very little if the entire rest of the experience is that bad. What should have been a pleasant, stress-relieving trip to a nice restaurant/bar ended up with us feeling used and even more stressed."}
{"text":"Brasserie V warms my heart.  Any place with frites and Belgian beer has my vote. 

The V is still one of my favorite places in town, but their new space bums me out a bit. They expanded space feasibly doubles the size of the restaurant, but they made the decision to make most of it bar. I was hoping they would put more tables in, but instead they more than doubled the size of the bar. This means my party of 4 had to wait over an hour at 8 pm on a Friday night to get a table. 

I still love the food. The frites and mussels are a must have. The food is usually fresh and tasty. The wait staff is great. The beer selection is fabulous and they have some great special taps. I just wish they would would have used the new space more efficiently."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Some good and some so-so points:

1) Excellent beer selection. If you're a fan of Belgian-style beers, you'll love it. A lot of beers on tap.
2) Coffee is excellent. They give you a small french press.
3) Food is tasty, but not amazing. Would have given four stars, but they don't allow substitutions or changes."}
{"text":"Their House beer St. Bernarus Apt 12 is one of my favorites! It is great that it is always on tap! Mussels and Frites are best in town. Overall great environment. Long wait on weekend evenings sometimes but it is worth it. Otherwise there is ample bar area to sit and have a beer and relax before your table it ready. Seasonal menus too!"}
{"text":"Brasserie V is a SURE THING on EVERYTHING!  Local and seasonal menus are just the beginning of the GREATNESS!  More European beer on tap than anywhere else in Madison!  Perfect ambiance, compete with compatible glassware, makes drinking your favorite beer even better!  Friendly service!  I've enjoyed the burger, fish, salads, mussels, FRITES, and have NEVER been disappointed.  Go tonight!  Waits are longer Friday and Saturday.  They serve 7 days a week."}
{"text":"The bf brought us here for Vday.  Had scallops,bf had steak both were high quality and extremely tasty.  I loved the ambience,service,and wine.  Must go!!!"}
{"text":"Frites are crazy good and if you like Moule Frites-forgeddaboutit. Good selection of Belgian Ales and now with a bigger space and dualing bars, you have a good spot to pop in and eat. Nice staff as well, daddy like."}
{"text":"I can't speak for too many things on the menu here, as every time I've been here I'm seduced by the moules et frites. They aren't my favorite rendition in town, but they are deliciously, classically prepared, with plenty of golden, crispy fries (which will inevitably be snitched by your dining companions who've made other choices). On our last visit we also indulged in the cheese board, and the only problem with that is having to choose which of the many cheese selections to include (my favorite was the Ewe Calf to be Kidding). Of course, for the beer drinkers, there is a long list to choose from, but for those of us who prefer wine, the selection isn't half bad, either."}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal, as always, at the Brasserie V.  It was super loud, though, and hard to hold a conversation (that's  1/2 a star deduction).   Besides the moules (mussels) that I love, I also ordered heirloom tomato salad, which was a big disappointment.  Heirloom tomatoes have such a wonderful taste that's all their own.  These were chopped up into tiny bits (slices would be better), and they were drenched in an overpowering dressing with strong balsamic vinegar (why not just a bit of olive oil and a pinch of salt to let the flavors come through (one more  1/2 star deduction)."}
{"text":"Wow!  I had the best meal here.  It was pretty crowded even on a Thursday night so we started off at the bar with some drinks while we waited for a table.  They have a great beer list and my wife really hit a home run with a Sam Smith Organic Strawberry beer.  My wife had the \"V Burger\" and claimed it to be the best burger she's ever eaten.  I had the cod and it was a perfectly balanced entree with a superb piece of fish.  We also had a cheese plate and the pork cheeks for appetizers and they were great.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Belgium beers--based solely on their beer selection, Brasserie V would be 5 stars. However, their food is pretty inconsistent and, at times, very mediocre. They have a different lunch and dinner menu--the lunch being my favorite of the two with some pretty fantastic sandwiches (the apple and provolone is my favorite). The one consistent thing on the dinner menu is the mussels and frites. They're hands-down the best in Madison. Paired with a Belgium beer or two, and you've got an amazing night out. The vibe in the restaurant is great--busy and lots of energy. However, the wait & bar staff is pretty hit-or-miss. Overall, really great--but not perfect."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Nice atmosphere. Never had anything here that wasn't absolutely delicious. The steak et frites is worth every penny. They'll typically give you two sides of aioli with the frites -- one standard garlic aioli (still extremely good) as well as some special flavor that they've put together for the day."}
{"text":"Not sure what differentiates Belgian cuisine from other cuisines, but if it includes delicious kale-quinoa salad or roasted Brussels Sprouts like those I had at Brassiere V, I will seek it out more often. Truly scrumptious. The downside was that my husband's duck was undercooked. Another interesting aspect of the restaurant is the amazing range of beer offerings. Sadly, I don't like beer; booklet listing them all made fascinating reading, however."}
{"text":"eh.. not impressed. The fries were really good, but my sandwich sucked. The bread was really hard, and there wasn't much flavor. Also there isn't much of a atmosphere.. mismatched and boring."}
{"text":"Tried the mussels in the pot great experience recommended by bartender
He was a fabulous host even spoke French for us and took the time to explain the history of the restaurant and theme and foods. Excellent a must stop.  Oh must try their frites!"}
{"text":"I came here on a whim as I was riding down Monroe street in Madison on a Friday evening after work. There is metered parking in front until 6pm, but I decided to swing around and catch some street parking not far off.  I was greeted and opted to sit at the bar as I was dining alone.  The place is quaint [read small] but with great decor for a brew house feel.  

I was quite impressed with the beer selection. I'm still growing into my beer boots, but to have the assortment of Belgian, Netherlands and other foreign (and respected) bottles on hand was quite a treat.  I flipped through pages and pages and settled on a a Belgian pale to go with the paté appetizer and moules et frites entree I ordered.  The beef and pork paté came with a large grain gourmet mustard, grilled baguette slices and sweet pickles.  The flavors together were wonderful, though the paté was a different texture than I expected; more of a tuna from the can consistency than a spreadable one.  But again, the flavors were great and the paté itself was wrapped in bacon. I mean, it's Wisconsin. You gotta have bacon.

The main course came out and I immediately went to my happy place.  The mussels were cleaned WELL and flavored impeccably. All a good medium size PEI mussels and the broth of garlic and white wine was simple and classic.  You get two dipping sauces for the fries and boy... I love sauce. One seemed to be a Parmesan aioli and the other a more garlic aioli. If I wasn't scraping the bottom of the cups with the fries, I would have had time to ask what exactly was in them.  Good.

The place filled up about 6:00 or 6:15, with dozens of folks crowded around the bar and front of the place. For good reason.  The staff is incredibly friendly and the food and beer are great.  Even the patrons were cordial; I had conversations with half a dozen of them while eating. I'll surely be back."}
{"text":"We went for lunch with friends and it was fun. But, the food was not that impressive. I had muscles with fries. Muscles were dry, no broth or sauce in the pot. And they gave us too much fries! Had to throw most of it"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try this place just off campus due to solid personal and Yelp recommendations. Initially, we weren't sure dinner would arrive at all; the server explained that a plumber was repairing something, and no one knew when it would be completed. But the situation was resolved within ten minutes of being seated, and we had an enjoyable dinner (despite the poor acoustics of the place causing sound to reverberate forever). Good burger, good fries, and good beer; so I've got nothing to complain about. But it just was not forty dollars and a drive across town good."}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch here :) Smoked turkey sandwich was delicious and the soups were tasty. Good service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp reviews and few others, we went to Brasserie V and it was fun/good all round.  Sure there's a wait, yet we planned for that and the Los at he bar were great.  He took great care o us until our tale was ready.  Mussels were relish, beer on tap fantastic, then the main course. The fish was great, as was the pasta and the burger was very good, medium rare.  Overall, it is a place for  great beer or wine and burgers, or something much more.  Here's raising an awesome beer on tap to a comfortable, friendly joint. Yum,M"}
{"text":"This isn't your classic cheeseburger but it is very very good. It gives a nice twist to the classic burger which livens the dish up but doesn't stray too far from the inspiration so you still get the satisfaction of a delicious beef  burger. Also I would recommend the salad to help balance the heaviness of the frites

I ordered the white truffle oil & Parmesan frites (fries) (big enough to share with another person I promise, I can eat a good amount and it is just not good for you to polish off a whole order yourself) and the V Burger and mixed greens. 

I also tried a vanilla bean 'dry soda'. Don't get it unless you like seltzer water as the flavoring is nigh undetectable and a simple glass of water is far more refreshing.

I definitely recommend this place and hope to make it back to sample the other sandwiches and perhaps a dinner entree soon."}
{"text":"I recently joined Yelp, thus a late review. We took some out-of-town friends here a couple years ago. We specifically chose this restaurant, innocently hoping we would have a great experience and meal. When you take out-of-towners to a restaurant, you want everything to go well: I expect good service and good food. We ordered our food and because we hadn't seen each other for a long time we were conversing. But after an hour, we didn't receive our food. We asked the waitress where our food was. Turns out she either forgot to place the order or it got lost. She wasn't apologetic and didn't seem to really care. I was really pissed off. The fries held us over until the food came. The whole experience could have been better if her attitude was even one iota apologetic. I don't recall if I asked for the manager. I don't recall if the food was good. The overall attitude toward us as customers was oblivion. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Great moules frites!  Delicious entrees.  Takes awhile to get a table, but the wait is worth it.  And of course, lots of beers to choose from.  I miss this place now that I don't live in Madtown anymore."}
{"text":"Best frites in Madison hands down.  We always share truffle frites to start, the 2 aiolis that accompany are always mouthwatering.  On this visit, I had the halibut with squid ink pasta/lemon beurre blanc.  Best piece of fish I've ever had!  The seared top was brown and perfectly crisp.  My husband had the equally delicious seared duck breast with truffled creamed spinach...drool!  I was happy to see other families with kids (ours are 7mos and 4), though we got some eye rolls from a crabby old lady.  Parents deserve good food too, sorry NOT sorry!"}
{"text":"Salty. They want you to drink. But it turns into a wonderful thing when you are surrounded by amazing Belgian beers. Aioli on the fries is incredible. Tuesday night is slider night, try it on for size. We tried a duck slider that was topped as if though it were a Greek dish - with cucumber salsa and tzatziki sauce. Very nice. Sauces pair pleasantly every time, something many other places have yet to figure out."}
{"text":"Great for lunch.  Love the burgers, frites, and croque monsieur.  Had a delicious chocolate mousse with candied almond slivers.  There is a great variety on the menu without being overwhelming.  I have come for dinner twice.  The first time I left because it was too packed.  The second I stayed.  It is quite small and gets very busy and bustling.  If you like that vibe, come try some great beers.  I will stick to the lunch."}
{"text":"There are two things wrong with BV: 1. you can't order a gin martini (only beer and wine), and 2. it is super small so any trip there will inevitably require a wait.  So why 5 stars? Because everything else is so phenomenal that these two things seem piddly by comparison.   They more than make up for the lack of a full bar with a great wine selection and even better beer selection.  And enjoying one or both of each makes the wait less onerous ;)  The food is always creative, prepared perfectly with only the best ingredients.  The service is always top notch - friendly and knowledgeable and professional.  

I know I said there were only two things wrong with BV, but really there are 3.  It's located in Madison, and I live in Milwaukee."}
{"text":"Brasserie V is a great local spot in Madison WI! I love brasserie V! Brasserie V is one of my favorite places to go get a burger! The best is the V burger! The fall V burger is also very good, it has a great taste and flavor! The truffle frites (fries)are so good !!! The frites come with different aioli sauces! A lemon aioli and a jalapeño aioli I believe! Overall I love Brasserie V and I hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"This is hands down our favorite restaurant in Madison!  There are so many wonderful things to say about it, but I will try to keep it in 2 points:

1. The Beer:  I love Belgian style beers, and in a city with plenty of beer (most of which is not that exciting, in my opinion) Brasserie V stands out because of its great selection of tap and bottled beers from Belgium, US craft brewers, and around the world.  There are enough taps that there is plenty of variety and the rotating taps always offer something new and exciting!   If that's not enough, their bottled beer selection is always excellent too.  I think this is the best place to drink beer in Madison.  The staff is also very knowledgeable about beer and willing to help in selection!

2.  The Food:  If possible, the food is even more exciting and wonderful than the beer.  First of all, it is delicious.  I have never had anything disappointing at Brasserie V and even simple meals such as soups and sandwiches stand out as excellent.  I also love Brasserie V's emphasis on locally grown, sustainable food.  I love knowing that the money I am spending is staying local and helping to support those who are growing vegetables and livestock sustainably.  

I hope that at some point Brasserie V is able to expand - more tables would be a plus, but I also love their Monroe Street location and  their space.  Even if they never expand, I am more than willing to go at off peak times, sit at the bar, and wait for a table if necessary.  It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Located on charming Monroe Street near clothing and wine shops, the Brasserie V is a go-to place for Belgian beers on tap or a casual lunch. This is not a place to go for cheese platters. I had been to Brasserie during winter break and had a pleasant (yet not memorable) lunch, so I was curious to return and check out their Belgian beers. My friend and I were not terribly hungry, but wanted a snack or two to accompany our Belgian brews. Being in Wisconsin it seemed cheese was the most appropriate choice . Our server told us that the small cheese platter was enough for 1-2 people, so we selected our requisite three cheeses from the chalkboard list and continued chatting.

A while later the wooden platter arrived and I was shocked to find three nearly microscopic slivers of cheese, each barely an eighth of an inch thick. What I later found out were \"spiced nuts\" (the mystery chunks served in a dollhouse-size bucket) did not do anyone any favors either.  I understand that less often does mean more when it comes to carefully selected cheeses, and I was not expecting an \"all-you-can-eat\" trough of the stuff. My gripe really revolves around the price--$15 for three nearly translucent cheese shavings and stale bread? No thank you!"}
{"text":"First of all let me say, if you like good beer you need to try out Brasserie V.  The list of Belgians is amazing and they have an incredible amount of tap beer for such a cozy place.  My favorite beer there is the St Berardus 12, it is deliciously dark, creamy, on tap and has a high and semi-masked ABV (10.5%). 
 If beer isn't your thing the food is pretty good too.  They have a quality burger and the kitchen seems to be dedicated to high quality ingredients, and often local ingredients (ex. Wisconsin beef from Fountain Prairie Farm.)  Keep in mind, when the place is busy it fills up fast.  I would also say that the size of the restaurant is cozy, so if you have a very large group this probably isn't the right choice, but in a group of four or smaller the environment is perfect.
If you are even remotely interested in good beer check this place out, I'm sure the beer menu has something to interest all tastes and it's also a menu that is pretty much unrivaled in Madison (The Old Fashion is comparable in quantity, but the difference is that the Old Fashioned serves good Wisconsin beers, but this place excels in European beers and Belgians.)"}
{"text":"After a dismal outing to Cafe Hollander, the new would-be competition for Brasserie V, I thought I should come back to show the place some love, since BV is soooooo much better.

4 stars instead of 5 because I've often found the service slow. But after going there for many years, I've never had anything other than really friendly, charming people serving us. The bartenders are excellent, especially if you consider that the beer menu is huge (meaning they must get lots of questions and people -- myself included -- dithering about with their choices) and they're always busy. The servers are nice too.

Range of beers is great, and I love the bartenders know the beers and will happily tell you about them, recommend things like X or not like Y depending upon how much you like the last thing you tried, etc. And the food is superb. The BV burger is probably the best in the city, and it's taken me many years of visits to know what the rest of the menu is like since I'm usually only too happy to order that again.

Great for lunch, for dinner, for a drink."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. The food taste good and they staff are helpful. I really like the Belgian frites and the burgers. It is also close to other shops on Monroe street."}
{"text":"Pretty friggin' good stuff here. As a Chicagoan, you get spoiled with good eats being but a coins throw away in any direction. I spent a few days relaxing at Devil's lake and on the way back home, wanted some yum-ness. So I figured, let's stop in Madison to fancy the local fare. Me and the mermaid stopped in, ordered some brewskies from the endless beer menu (following the server recommendation, of course), and loved every drop. Ordered some amazing marinated asparagus and some to-die-for starters, then washed them down with yet another selection of brews.The main course for me was a delectable salad with the most amazing bacon I've chowed on. . . ever. Had some duck to go with it but, after now the 4th time eating it, I've realized I'm not a fan. If I was a fan, I'm sure their duck is some of the best. We also had a sensational bucket of mussels that was about as good as you can get in the middle of the Midwest, surrounded by nothing but green pastures, lake Mendota, and frat boys. Desert was this ridiculous raspberry sorbet; outstanding. The server paired it with a nice, bitter brew that made the tastebuds go \"schwing!!\" This place was excellent, service was excellent, ambiance was excellent, and the price was beyond reasonable for a city boy like me. I highly recommend stopping in if you're in Madison and appreciate some good eats."}
{"text":"Tuesday night sliders!  My friend took me here while I was visiting Madison.  Sat on the newly-expanded side of the bar and had a great experience.  Knowledgable bartenders helped us choose the perfect Belgium beer to accompany my sliders on a chilly, February night.  Loved the pairings and unique presentation of our food.  (We also ordered a couple of salads and lentil soup.)  Will definitely come here again when back in Mad-town!"}
{"text":"I only went to Brasserie V for the delicious European beer, so I can't comment on the food, other than that a friend said he had the best burger of his life here. The beer is fantastic! I had a Flemish cherry ale and loved every drop. I hear the selection changes quite frequently, so if you like one, get your fill before it's gone. The two girls serving us at the bar were friendly and cheerful. The atmosphere is classy and relaxed, if a bit loud from all the talking (it was completely full, though, so that is to be expected - and we could still talk at normal volume and be heard). I would agree that the service was slower than it could have been, but when you're in the perfect place to spend a couple of hours chatting over a drink or two with a few close friends, it blends into the relaxed atmosphere rather than taking away from it. The only time I would not recommend this place is when you are in a hurry (hurrying to get somewhere else, or hurrying to get drunk)."}
{"text":"Best beer selection in Madison. Some very rare beers that will be hard to find anywhere in the country. The food is very nice as well. I enjoy spending weekday afternoons here, sharing appetizers and high quality brews."}
{"text":"Really loved the place. Great beer selection, great food and awesome service. Went there for a late lunch on Saturday and enjoyed a quiet time. Definitely going back next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"I like this place, good food, great drink selection.  My two complaints: Sandwiches never change and its a bit pricy for what you get. A bit like Cafe Hollander in the sense you pay $10+ for a microscopic size beer glass or a very short glass of wine. If I could not walk here, I would likely not go."}
{"text":"They've expanded and the place is much roomier now. The beer selection was great as was the food selection. I was really happy to see so many vegetarian options, too, including the chive pasta. The space is open and airy with wood floors and very pleasant and helpful servers. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I like this place...  

As everyone pretty much knows Brasserie V fills up quick!  Its very small and the atmosphere is very cozy (unless you get sat at the table by the door in winter).  Come early to experience the beer and wine selection well waiting for your table! 

Every time I go here I get the Frites.  Ahhh yum I can taste the dipping sauces right now. Don't let them skip out on serving you bread because you ordered an appetizer.  The butter for the bread (or in my case frites) is too good to miss. 

I love their duck entrees and I usually get that every time I go.  Its nice that they switch up the menu but I really enjoyed the duck leg served over greens vs the new casserole duck entree.  Its still very good though! Just don't burn your tongue! 

Service overall was good.  The hostess was super friendly and helpful.  We actually sat at the bar to eat instead of waiting for a table. Best thing is since you are at the bar your bartender/server is always right there on top of everything.  Eating at the bar, I think you get faster friendlier, service. Plus you can figure out what your favorite new Belgian beer is. 

* * If you like the beer selection here I would recommend trying out the Malt House on E. Wash.  But don't go the the Malt House hungry...  they don't serve food."}
{"text":"One of our absolute favorite restaurants in Madison. Can definitely be crowded and the wait can be long but the food is great! Very inventive and the extensive beer list impressive. Also good selection of wines."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of beers. The prices are all over the place but you will find something you like. The bartender was very helpful in giving samples and recommendations. The frites were amazing; the aioli dip moreso. Then we sat down for lunch. Everyone's dishes were tasty; except that my father was given a burger that was cooked on the outside but literally raw on the inside. We sent it back but they stuck the whole plate, including the greens, in the microwave so that everything was soggy when it came back. His dish was eventually free but had they given him a fresh dish so he would have had an edible meal, I'd give the place 4 stars."}
{"text":"The apple Swiss sandwich with pesto is a fine vegetarian option. The beer selection is ample and you can choose the size, 4.5 ounces or a pint. 
We were there on a Saturday at 4:15pm and it was not too busy. It wasn't empty either. It got busier closer to 5. 
The restrooms are nice and clean.
Right next to the Cat Cafe Mad on Monroe."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is an excellent, sort of upscale place to go. You do have to wait a while if you go there on a busy night but it is def. well worth the wait. I will def be returning here. The beer is great and the food prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Writing from a drinking only perspective, this place fills a need in the Monroe Street area. I would like to enjoy their food at dinner point but other nearby restaurants get me with their more enticing menus and dining areas with fewer passerbys; I'll get to it. Great location for friends meeting after work, coming from different sides of town.

The beer selection here is incredible - as in they hand you a book. Somewhat ale heavy, trendy as it may be. They do have sour(s?)! Beers available is multiple sizes so you won't break the bank as beer is pricy here. Worth the visit if you're interested in trying new beers or grabbing a beer you can't get elsewhere in town. Other people sure seem to think so, I've only nabbed a bar stool once here!"}
{"text":"Most unique beer selection in Madison. Very friendly & knowledgeable staff behind the bar. Go on Tuesdays for 3 of the most incredible sliders you've ever tasted. And don't skip the French fries."}
{"text":"I thought dining here was an interesting experience, although it definitely didn't exceed my expectations.

My wife and I went for lunch on our first visit to Madison together. We started the meal off with some frites and dipping sauce, which were easily the best thing about the meal. As others have mentioned they truly are amazing. On the other hand the rest of the meal was far from spectacular. I ordered the Smoked Salmon BLT and did not enjoy it as much as I expected to. It wasn't very good at all, so I didn't even end up finishing it. My wife got the Caprese, which she liked a little better than I liked my sandwich, but also thought it was a letdown after the appetizer.

The service was decent, but I don't remember anything special about it. The restaurant feels kind of cozy though and the Belgian theme is neat, so I wouldn't mind coming back again. Next time I visit I may just come in to get some of those frites as a snack! They were so good!"}
{"text":"I love BV. I went there for lunch with my dad last week. Such a nice place to stop and have a bite or a drink or why not both! Great service and such yummy food. Frites to die for!"}
{"text":"So what is a vegetarian mom to do when her two teenage boys (both over six feet tall) are craving them some burgers in Madison and surroundings? Get thee to Brasserie V, ASAP!
You and the carnivores will have a great time, solid friendly service, yummy food and to die for addictive fries! It is a little noisy here... not a place for a cozy date; but a night with the boys, friends, or beer buddies- can't miss. (Crazy great beer selection, not just a beer list, but a tome...beer bible?)
I will be back for the avocado tomato tartine and the grannie apple/ Swiss/ baguette sandwich with, or without, the teen Titan burger boys!"}
{"text":"I don't drink beer or eat meat, so I'm clearly missing the draw of this place. I like that they have Lindemans, but I don't think it is a great compliment to say a place has amazing frites (do people realize this just French for fries?). Yes, there are good fries and bad fries, but it doesn't take a brain surgeon to know how to smoke good ones (hint: start with whole potatoes, cut them). The chickpea appetizer was so oddly chewy, it gave me lockjaw. I don't like that you can't sit at a table unless you are ordering a meal, as sitting at the bar isn't conducive if you are with more than one person. It will take good company to get me back in here, as the food alone isn't going to do it."}
{"text":"Went with a friend who is a celiac and made it very clear he needed gluten free everything. A few bites into the meal he relished he'd been given normal bread. For a place that advertises being gluten free friendly they were completely irresponsible about severe allergies."}
{"text":"Monroe Street is Madison's answer to Williamsburg, and cunningly Brasserie V is making a name for itself among the local, slightly off-brand of bearded, skinny-jean-donning hipsters. My  companion and I arrived on a late, slushy afternoon for a meal, she trying the shitake sandwich and I, the V Burger. My frites came with just-ok aioli mayo; ketchup arrived only after a request. Both meals were excellent, with fresh and proportionate portions, although my burger arrived a bit underdone. Our servista was cheerful and attentive. Cost came to about $30 (no drinks). 

In the minus column, the tables were too closely packed, causing unnecessary collisions with group of four cologne-emitting gentlemen behind us. While our waitperson was excellent,  the chatter among other staff members was distracting and unprofessional. 

The atmosphere is warm and well-lit. 

Our judgment: we'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Come here if you want good food and a vast array of beer selections. If you're looking for hard to get imports from all over the world, this is your place. If you're looking for hard to find collaborations, this is your place. Fun atmosphere but it fills up quickly on Friday's after 6:30. If you are wanting to have some great food and drink, it's well worth the wait"}
{"text":"First off, this is one of those moments that I really wish you had half stars on Yelp.  I would probably give it a 3.5, but I'm feeling stingy so I'll bump down instead of up today.  

We went to dinner on a Saturday night with the in-laws that were visiting.  This was after many a reject of other restaurants that had too much \"weird food\" (their words, NOT mine) on their menu.  We got there at about 7pm and had a 45 minute wait for a table of 4.  Which was fine, although they didn't mention anything about sitting at the bar to eat to shorten the wait or anything along those lines.  So we waited around for our table which gave me plenty of time to scope out other people's plates and try to decide what I wanted to eat.  

So we finally got seated and to my delight we were by the kitchen and I had prime viewing of the kitchen.  (I realize that most people don't like this, but I like snooping into kitchens, being a culinary student and all)  I will say the service was a little slow in getting someone to our table, bringing water, taking drink orders, etc.  Not so much that it was like super annoying, but enough that I was wondering what was taking so long.  This is when I started to notice the curious phenomenon of there being TONS of people walking back and forth from the bar to the kitchen to tables, etc.  There were so many people working and I am convinced that they took the most inefficient paths to get places as they possibly could.  Am I the only person that finds it strange that the waiters don't use trays to carry plates out?  It took them sometimes 4 trips to get a table everything they needed, surely that could be cut down drastically.  Anyway.

We got an order of regular frites for the table per Yelp recommendations (definitely passing on the truffle oil ones, bleck!) and I ordered the Summer V Burger with the mixed greens salad and a wheat beer.  The fries were good, but honestly when I get fries at an actual restaurant, I expect them to be pretty darn good.  I wasn't blown away by them, but I was satisfied.  

This is where most people would then expound upon the ginormous beer list and talk about how awesome it is, but for me, I really only like a few kinds of beers and I found the list to be very overwhelming.  The wine list looked decent, but honestly that night I was really feeling a craft cocktail, which was not an option.  I mean, you go to Brasserie V for the beer, I get it.  I just picked the first one that the hubs said I would like.  And I did, but it didn't blow my mind.

The burger came  and was good.  I liked the combination of the tomato jam, smoked goat cheese, and the ciabatta bun.  The hubs and FIL got the regular V burger and theirs came on sourdough bread slices instead of a bun, which I found strange, but they said it tasted good.  I felt my bun was a little too much for the sandwich, but overall it was good.  The meat was cooked well and tasted awesome.  Definitely the highlight of the meal.  I can appreciate good meat on a burger, so definitely can recommend that.  The mixed greens salad it came with was a joke.  It was just lettuce in a simple lemon vinaigrette that wasn't seasoned and I only ate half of because salad is supposed to be good for you.  

We also got a chocolate caramel tart for dessert that the table shared which was also tasty, but not outstanding.  

Overall, it wasn't bad, but I wasn't super excited by it when I left.  The burger I had was good, but unless I was in a big beer mood, I wouldn't necessarily say we should drive across town to go there.  I think it's worth checking out the entree selections and maybe sit at the bar next time to get more advice from the bartenders about a beer I might LOVE, instead of just like."}
{"text":"Not too much I can add that hasn't already been said. One major positive worth noting:

Brasserie V is the only place I've seen in Madison that regularly offers appropriately-priced small pours of their tap beers (four ounces). This is GREAT - it allows one to try the well-curated Belgian ales and other beers without having to commit to a full pint of something with strong flavor or that is high alcohol. I wish every place with unique tap beers did this, as I'm able to try more styles and still have my wits about me.

Come for the beer, stay for the frites."}
{"text":"Excellent Wisconsin Belgian beer & fare delight. Atmosphere was cozy, classic/elegant with a twist of sophistication. The pommes frites were some of the best I've had as well as aioli. My friend got the an amazing salad that he couldn't finish (really- it was deceptively large!) and I tried the gnocchi (larger than usual) with mushrooms and cream sauce that was delicious. I wish we were more in the mood for beer tasting since the listing was impressive..."}
{"text":"Simply put, I love this spot.  One of my favorites in Madison, which is along the trendy Monroe corridor.  

If you want to drink good beer, with plenty of selection, this is the place.  Granted it's a Belgium-style pub, so they cater more Belgium brews, but they still carry a wide variety of other international beers.  But along with that, their food is great.  Smaller menu, with more appetizers and cheese plates, but some dinner options.  Get the Frites!  Classic, easy to snack on, and their aioli is delicious.  Just recently had the Sausage & Spinach Agnolotti, which is like a ravioli, and it was mouth-wateringly good.  The buttery-creme sauce was incredible.  

The ambiance and decor is very warm and comfortable.  A lot of wood and rustic charm.  The waitstaff are very professional and polite, know their menu and are very cool to talk to."}
{"text":"The highlight was the Truffle Fries appetizer(enough for three), with the special dipping sauces. Avocado BLT paired nicely with the Sweet Corn Soup and the Leffe Blonde. All around excellent lunch experience."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection! The large selection makes it hard to choose, luckily the bartenders are extremely knowledgable and make your selection a little easier. I ordered the Halibut, which was delicious! Great environment, great staff, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Ive heard some good things about this place so we decided to go check it out for dinner. Got to the restaurant at about 6:55pm on a Sunday (yea, I know.. peak time). We were told that the wait would be 30-40 minutes. So, we waited at the bar area with a drink and some truffle frites.  The truffle flavor was pretty weak in the fries, though the aoli (regular and curry) were excellent. We ended up waiting for 50 minutes to an hour and that's where I'm dropping the rating. Usually restaurants over-estimate the wait time, so I was pretty disappointed that we had to wait even longer. By the time we got seated, I had finished all the truffle fries (with 1 other, but I ate most of it). I didn't want to order anything because I was so full. I ended up ordering the small brussels salad and the sweet corn soup, and my friend ordered the mussels du jour. They also have mussels with frites, but since we had eaten so many fries already he ordered the other one. Funny - his dish ended up coming with fries and we brought the whole thing home. My salad was great and the soup was not that great. Mussels du jour had chorizo, onions, and green peppers. The bit I tried tasted good. Overall, it was an okay experience and table service was good. Apparently, Sunday had half price bottles of wine though!"}
{"text":"Went to Brasserie V last year and it was awesome. Came back this year and our experience was quite disappointing.  The quality of food was not up to par. My fish was underdone. My husband's duck was chewy and muscular. Doubt i will return and if so, it would probably just before the muscles."}
{"text":"Great Belgian restaurant. Had mussels and fries. This time I had \"build your own lunch\" which has smoked turkey sandwich and the pasta salad."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and delicious menu.   Service is always excellent! You must try the frites!"}
{"text":"Beer vs. Food... Is it a bar, or is it a restaurant?? No one knows because they do both so incredibly well. 

Belgian beer bar  - fresh local food - historic monroe street. This killer combination makes Brasserie V my favorite spot in all of Mad-Town.

Thank you Van Nest family and wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"Looking for beer? This is the best spot in town!! With hundreds of choices, you'll not be starved for decision. My favorites are belgian beers like Chimay Blue, Duvel, and fruit beers that taste like sparkling wine! The local new glarus beer is also really tasty!

Are you hungry? No worries. this place is the best in town for Belgian frites. double fried, done right every single time as said by the boss. Also the soups and V burger is also a hit. If you're just looking for bar food, the sliders are really tasty as well. I also like the truffle fries, but if I had to pick, the Belgian frites are my favorite! ^.^

They also often do alot of beer tasting, probably once a month. Very fun activity. 

The space was recently expanded, there's more bar space and a few more tables. If you're there with just a friend, sit at the bar! They serve the full menu there as well! If you wanna go there in a group, it might be hard unless you're there before 6pm. 

Frites, great beer. And a great selection of French wine as well! What more can you ask for :)"}
{"text":"My friend Paul took me here and raved about the quality of the restaurant. Call me skeptical but open-minded. He was right, though!!! The cheese plate was amazing, especially the sharp aged cheddar (10 yrs I believe)?!  I also had some appetizer I forgot (but it was great) and a BURGER, which was delicious and one of the best I've had in Madison. It's pretty busy, but we had no problems with seating at the bar, and they opened a second \"wing\" of the restaurant recently."}
{"text":"Am I a poor college kid? Yes. Was I willing to splurge on beer and white truffle oil fries at Brasserie V? Hell yes.

With one of the widest selections of Belgian beers (and obscure, great beers in general), Brasserie V is a great choice for beer drinkers with discerning taste. Their normal French fries seemed delicious, but we sprung for the white truffle oil fries and it was SO WORTH IT. It's like eating happiness. Trust me."}
{"text":"Good food, looooooooooooong wait. 

Be prepared to wait for a table, then wait for a drink, then wait for your food. 

The food and drink are good, but you're going to wait. I'm talking 30-45 minutes to get in, then 30-45 minutes for your food."}
{"text":"The frites are delicious. The burgers are small, dry, and over priced.  The hostess was not very helpful amd seemed like she needed more training. Our waitress/bartendar was nice and did a good job. Overall for the price you pay for food there Madison has much better options."}
{"text":"Very warm friendly vibe, maybe to 8% ABV adds to this?"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. The food is well prepared. The ambiance is upbeat and the waitstaff friendly and efficient. It is very busy after 6 PM and often somewhat loud."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here and that alone makes me wonder if I shouldn't just give it five stars at some point! I save those for the knock out experiences, otherwise I probably would. The menu is seasonal, but you can count on at least a variation of a few of your favorites making their way back to the menu each year. Everything I have tried has always been very well prepared, and often times it is simple yet very rich in flavor. 
This time around was a Saturday night during the construction craziness that is Monroe street, where we met our parents for dinner with the kiddos.  It was busier than expected, but we easily got a table after a short wait at about 5:30. 
We ordered a couple of orders of frites as well as the Belgian meatballs. Paprika aioli had a tiny kick that was really nice with the frites - two orders was just barely sufficient for the 7 of us.  The meatballs were outstanding. I do a little happy dance every time I see meatballs on this menu, and this particular version will stick out for a while. Tender, flavorful, and the sauce had a great finish.  Loved the complement of the mushrooms as well. Carbonade Flamande, the Flemish beef stew, was my choice for the evening.  Both of these dishes should have been served with a small piece of soft fresh bread for ease of mopping up the last bit of awesome on your plate. 
You'll never go wrong choosing this place. The food is prepared by people who care about food, and the bar atmosphere is both welcoming to families yet trendy enough to hang out in with friends. If you are reading this in 2018, don't sweat the construction. Plenty of parking on side streets."}
{"text":"This is my goto restaurant for moules and frites.  The beer selection is quite large and kind of $$.  Wine list is really good!  Stop by, you'll love it."}
{"text":"The food is good.  I had two meals, lunch and dinner, and both meals were good.  The atmosphere is nice and I would definitely recommend it to a friend if they were in the area.  

My only problem was the service.  Lunch was good, the bartender/server, Brian, was attentive and did a good job ensuring my meal and experience was enjoyable.  Dinner was a different experience.  There was only a handful of customers, and I suppose when they aren't busy, the employees tend to play.  They gathered in corners to discuss plans, sipped on different beers (good gig- wish I worked here), and made it rather uncomfortable.  

I don't need you to talk with me through my dinner, but I definitely don't want to hear your discussion or have you gather around my side of the bar.  It kind of made me feel like I was at a party that I wasn't invited to.  Awkward."}
{"text":"In town for work. Could not wait to get back here as it has always been a favorite when in Madison.  Drove across town out of the way of my hotel to go there.  Busy night here but not bad. Walked in and asked the hostess for a table for one for dinner. With no smile or apparent need for customers her short reply was there are no tables but you can eat in the bar. No further assistance. I then sat down at the bar along the wall across from the main bar. There I sat for 15 minutes. The bar tenders could plainly see me sitting there.  I was facing the main bar which was about 5 feet away. No acknowledgement at all. The next two couples that came in were given menus by the hostess. 

After 15 minutes and no further human contact I put on my coat and walked out.  Incredible.  I don't recall ever walking out of a restaurant in my life for lack of contact.  Utterly disappointing.  Actually bad service may have been better than no service.  There was no shortage of people working tonight. Just poorly trained with respect to customer service.  So many missed opportunities to treat a returning client as if they mattered. 

Not sure if I will ever return. At least the waitress at Noodles and Company was attentive and pleasant.  I would give 0 stars but that isn't possible."}
{"text":"No complaints here! Yummy food, plenty of beer and a warm and cozy ambiance make this place a winner in my book.

I was here on a date with my boyfriend and lucky for us we decided to come on a Tuesday night. I can imagine it gets pretty crowded on the weekends as it was busier than I expected it to be on a weekday. We were told when we walked in that it would be about a 30 minute wait for a table. We said okay and found a place at the bar. However right when we were about to place our order for drinks the hostess found us and told us that she already had a table open up, yay for us! 

So we sat down at our own little table in the corner. Like I said the inside is super cozy. My boyfriend and I both ordered a beer, I wish I could remember the name of the one I ordered because it was delicious. He enjoyed his as well, but I really can't imagine not finding a beer you like here! We started with the Frites, which were super yummy. I love freshly cut fries and the dipping aioli made them that much better. Then, my boyfriend ordered the Fall V Burger which he very much enjoyed. I ordered the slider special (which they have on Tuesday nights, along with $2 off bottled beer). My sliders were amazing. Every one of them had bacon on it which was cooked perfectly, super crispy without being overcooked. I of course can't remember the other toppings on them but trust me, they were so good. The burgers were also cooked perfectly which is difficult to do with sliders, and the buns were buttery and toasty. I'd come back on a Tuesday to order them again! 

Although my boyfriend isn't a dessert person, I happen to love it so I ordered a creme brulee all to my self. Of course it was delicious. There was a hint of cinnamon in the creme that I really enjoyed. 

If I haven't made it clear yet, this place rocks! I can't wait to bring my dad here who loves to try beer from around the world. Only thing they were missing that I would've loved to see was some beer from the Czech Republic. Other than that, I have nothing to complain about. Great place for a date!"}
{"text":"Hmm...what is this? Is it a paperweight? A bowling ball? A dumbbell? No, it's Brasserie V's beer menu, which I have to imagine clocks in around 5 lbs. It's very extensive and covers the globe.

So that makes the 4 set beer samplers a really *great* idea. South African mead + German potato beer + Italian IPA. M'kay, I'll expand my palate today. Yup.

Foodwise, I know people complain that it is on the pricey side (true) but they will put duck breast on any dish you ask them too! You have to pay for that kind of duck-heavy service.

I love, love, love the atmosphere. You can never (nope) get a table, so we always sit at the cozy let's-pretend-we-are-in-Belgium bar and people watch. Ooo, look at those hipsters with their Warby Parker glasses. Is that a dad feeding his 7-year-old daughter fries ad aoili? Yep. Ooo, look at the beard on that man who is talking to the bartender about local beer, I think I saw it in Madewell last month. 

So, if vast tracks of beer, duck breast and fun people watching at the bar don't sound like your thing, maybe don't go here. And don't call me, I'll call you (doesn't call you)."}
{"text":"Fall V Burger was outstanding. Zucchini sandwich was nice. Beer selection is great. We got a mushroom soup that was amazing. And the berries and cream w/ lemon curd housemade dessert was the perfect ending. 

Nice environment, friendly staff. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. Food is wonderful, love all the beer selections. The service has always been wonderful and we've never waited longer than 30 mins for a table even on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"We showed up at Brasserie V with high expectations. Our friend had been ogling the beer list for the past three months, and the menu had some nods to Belgian cuisine, so we were definitely amped up about the place. We showed up and were told the wait would be 30 minutes. 

No problem! We'll just grab some drinks at the bar ... except that when we ambled up to the bar, the hostess informed us that we couldn't sit there because there were people who were waiting to sit at the bar. We told her that we were just ordering drinks while we wait for our table, and she settled down a bit.

We took our drinks back to our little corner and chatted while we waited. Our friend wanted to keep a tab open at the bar, but the bartender had already closed us out after one round.

Well, we sure felt welcome here.

And finally, we were summoned to our table for dinner! Our excitement was palpable. We were walked past two open tables ... so we could be seated at the table all the way in the back, by the kitchen. Maybe we weren't dressed nicely enough.

The restaurant sports an award for the best fries in Wisconsin. These are decent fries, but the best? I hardly think so.

The pheasant was good.  

The lamb ragout dish looked like an overpriced version of Hamburger Helper. There was a handful of pasta, and there may have been lamb in there, but we certainly couldn't find it. Hey, maybe dinner is a scavenger hunt!

The duck confit was a massive disappointment. I've had this dish many times at other places in other cities, and it's always very flavorful, moist and tender because it's been poached for hours and cooked in its own fat. How could this dish possibly be dry, right?  Well, it was so dry that the texture seemed like it was yesterday's duck, and that's being generous.

And then there was the steak. It was ultimately tasty, but we had asked for it to be medium, and upon its arrival, we poked the middle with a fork. It had way too much bounce to be medium. We cut it open to confirm our suspicions, and sure enough, it was still quite red in the center. So we flagged down the waitress and apologized. We didn't want to be difficult, but the steak wasn't done to our specifications, so could she please have it heated up some more?

Well. 

We were told that the steak needed to rest for five minutes to continue cooking, and we were at fault because we'd cut into it and now it wouldn't cook anymore.

We waited for her to offer to take the dish back, but that offer never came. So we acquiesced to finish up the steak as is, and it was quite fine, but we have never, EVER been held at fault for an undercooked steak. If a steak needs to rest, please let it do so in the kitchen, or tell me when you present the steak to me at the table that I can't touch it for five minutes while it continues cooking. If you set the dish in front of me, then it's ready to eat, not five minutes away from being done.

We might have been able to overlook the hit-and-miss food if the service had been good.  But when the restaurant makes us feel *THIS* unwelcome, we can take a hint. 

We won't be back."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Madison. Great beer selection and solid food. I love the record booth"}
{"text":"Yet another entree in Madison's ever-expanding \"locally-grown-fare\" venues, Brasserie V has been around long enough to establish itself as a leading contender in face of up-and-comers like Graze and Nostrano. My experience here was along the lines of \"come for the beer, stay for the food\", in that the menu is of mixed interest. By and large, you're going to choose between sandwiches or entrees. The former consists of variations on a theme usually involving some combination of avocados and aioli. Certainly fresh and tasty, but not great. Entrees are of the rustic, comfort-food variety. I had the pork belly with cheddar mash and peanut sauce . . . very flavorful but the pork was a little dry. The hit of the evening was the beefy Carbonnade Flamande, quite tender and succulent. The frites here are renowned, but I found them overly salty and far from the melt-in-your-mouth delights you get at Graze. 

But the star here is the beer list, the most complete (to the point of overwhelming) selection of Belgian ales anywhere in Madison. And for those intimidated by such esoterica, there are still plenty of local brews to choose from (the Oso Wisconsin porter I had was delicious). Atmosphere on a Saturday night was crowded and boisterous; obviously a lot of neighborhood regulars hold this place in high esteem. We'll want to go back, particularly for the burgers, but I'm still looking for the perfect farm-fresh venue in Madison."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots. Excellent beer selection. Unique, delicious, and fresh food. Have always enjoyed their burgers and veggie sides. 

Cute atmosphere too! Only issue is they don't take reservations, so call ahead so that you don't get stuck with a wait!"}
{"text":"Just went here the other night. Solid food. Awesome Belgian beer."}
{"text":"This place has such a cool vibe. Amazing and massive beer selection!!! Amazing!! One of the best and high quality I've ever seen. Their food menu is versatile and unique! Highly recommend, I'm not a vegetarian but their mushroom sandwich sounded so different. And holy cow! Shit was amazeballs! It was super hearty and filling and damn delicious and dare I say healthy, and I wasn't even going for healthy. If you are in the area you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  
The whole family went to try Brasserie V on Friday night.  There was a 20 minute wait, but there was enough room for the kids to sit down and for the parents to have a beer.
Once seated, our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  They have kids meals for $4.95. Well done Brasserie V!  Parents still get to order a special meal and their kids are happy as well.  We ordered V Burgers and a giant bowl of mussels.  Kids meal choices were simple but all good stuff; grilled cheese, spaghetti, etc. with sides.  Even came with a toy too!
V Burgers were just as yummy as the menu exclaimed them to be.  The onions put it over the top for me.  They really hit the mark.  Burger cooked perfectly.  The artichoke side salad was a little bland but we poured some of the mussel broth over it.  Now we're talking.
The mussels were perfect.  My 8 year old mussel connoisseur said they were the best he's had.  There were plenty of the little bivalves in there to keep a person busy for a while.  
The waitress kept the drinks coming, talked to our kids and helped make this first visit a great one.  Everyone wants to come back.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"While in town, this was another must that my cousin raved about. So I was pretty excited to try it. From what I had heard, Brasserie V had an outstanding list of beers, and amazing food.

We walked in and it had an old victorian, dark & cool kinda feel to it. We got seated right away, in the back right by the kitchen. Our waiter was fantastic, and patient with us as we took a little bit on what we wanted to drink since there were pages upon pages of all different beer from around the world to choose from. 

I honestly can not remember what beer I had gotten unfortunately, all I know is that it was an IPA since it was National IPA Day! For my dinner I ended up getting an Apple Swiss, with mixed greens as a side, we also got the truffle frites which was great, my only complaint with the Apple Swiss sandwich was that the baguette was extremely hard, I thought my teeth were going to rip out from trying to bite down on it so hard. 

Truly other than the hard baguette, my experience here was great! I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"The food is great here and the beer/wine list is expansive. But I noticed a lot of very young children and babies coming through the door. I thought, they must have a tremendous kids menu to warranty so much attention from families. Sure enough, one of the previous reviewers mentioned the kids menu and even a toy they get. What is this, McDonald's? If you love the babble of childish noises with your Belgium beer, step right up. Best of all, the babies crying really carry through the place, due to all the hard surface."}
{"text":"Like many other reviewers it seems, I left Brasserie V really impressed. First off, my son and i had really good food--a V burger and mussels and fries that were outstanding. Secondly, a really tasty belgian beer that I don't remember the name of-I'm more of a wine guy than a beer guy but this beer was outstanding. The Bartender/Server (we ate at the bar) was generous enough to pour me 4 small glasses of 4 different beers so that i could pick one i liked--again--I'm not a beer expert. But, I found the beer i liked and it was absolutely delicious. Best of all though, our server was a true gentleman. He gave my son great insight on UW (we were in Madison to tour the campus). His kindness and attention capped off the dinner. Bottom line--great food-great atmosphere-superb staff!! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"You guys deserve 6 stars for the beer. Very knowledgeable, and one day I hope to get through 3 pages worth of beer on the list before it changes - doubt that is happening anytime soon. But a great place to stick to favorites, explore diverse tastes and be experimental with beer! Food is also good, so a plus. 
My favorite though, is to sit by the bar with H and explore the beer menu. 
A big shout out to the guys behind the bar - very friendly and helpful, plus you get most shots into the cork container!"}
{"text":"We were in the Monroe area Friday evening so decided to stop in at Brasserie V for a beverage. The place was busy but it was early and they were able to seat us. Upon learning it was our first time at Brasserie V, our waitress was excited to give us the run down. Cultivating a European cafe feel, an extensive beer list, and tasty sounding appetizers we decided to order some food as well. We ended up ordering three beers and two starters. The Barbary Barrel Noir and the Dynamo Donut Barrel Noir from Almanac were outstanding. I have not found those elsewhere in the area so it was great to see different offerings. Our waitress highly recommended the frites, so we ordered those as well as the fondue. The fondue was served in a large crock with apple slices and bread pieces and there was easily enough cheese for 4 or 6 people. Even using our frites we ran out of dipping material long before we ran out of cheese. I loved the fondue experience and the volume of cheese was incredible. It was definitely a fun dish to try and we were stuffed afterwards. There were many other amazing sounding dishes on the menu. The only downside was that there was definitely a wait in getting our beers after we ordered them. That being said, I will definitely go back and would highly recommend the Brasserie V to others."}
{"text":"Brasserie V is pretty similar to the other modern, trendy dining locations in Madison.

The atmosphere is hip and lively, the food is wholesome and delicious (I'm looking at you, white truffle fries, pork ribs and duck breast), the wait inevitable and the prices fair.

However, what really makes this place stand out among the rest is their drinks menu. And by menu, I mean a short book. Yes, they basically have pages on pages on pages of the different kinds of brew they serve. I don't care if you're the most picky person on this planet when it comes to beer, but you WILL find something you like.

If you couldn't already tell, I'm a huge fan of their brew selection. Some of my favorites: Rochefort 10, Malheur, Schloss Eggenberg Samichlaus and the Konig Pilsener. And if you don't recognize any of these beers, then this place has definitely done their job correctly. 

Come here for the food, but stay for the draaanks!!"}
{"text":"I have been here before for mussels, which is what they are famous for... And here I am, getting it again for the second time.... And I am greatly disappointed.

A third of the mussels aren't \"opened\" and technically you aren't supposed to eat them. And I nicely told the waiter and wanted him to reflect to the kitchen and he was basically ignoring my opinion and said that it's always been that case....

Poor food, poorer service.

Never coming back."}
{"text":"My finance and I were on Monroe and starving. I heard great things about this place. We walked up and no one was there. We decided to sit at the front window. Great little place we thought. Ordered our food. And waited, as people piled into the restaurant, everyone working was super attentive and kind. Directing people to the few tables that were left, they were efficient and quite lovely. After waiting for what seemed like forever, I had to use the restroom. 

This should have been my first sign. Not only did the bathroom stink to high heaven, but shit was falling off the walls. It was dirty and quite nasty. I felt like I would never escape or be the same after that bathroom. But you really can't judge a place on the bathroom. Right?

We heard the chef bell ring multiple times and each time reared our heads like Pavlovian dogs. Finally, our food came. I ordered an avocado blt. I immediately tore into it, and it was fantastic! Nueske's bacon, perfect amount of everything. Just perfect. Until...yikes what is this...a hair! Eieeeiei!!! 

If there is one thing I cannot handle in my food it is hair. So I slowly pulled it out and showed my finance. He knows me, so he said please do not puke right here. I held it together and put it in my napkin. I knew I would not eat another bite. Then suddenly as he was devouring his food, he sees it, not just one but two hairs. He decided to keep eating, yes it was that good. He ate around them. He left the hairs to show the waitress. When he pulled them out they were so long and cooked entirely with the food, I had to excuse myself because I was gagging so hard. 

Previous to finding not one, but many hairs in our food on both dishes, we were discussing how this could be our new go-to place for yum. After that, well I cannot eat there again.  I would recommend the restaurant investing in some hairnets. Their food is good, but not hair worthy. The waitress was a sweetheart about it, and I appreciate that. I would recommend it only if you don't mind what you may find in your food."}
{"text":"Best food. Best beer. Best service. The owner is kind, the wait staff prompt and polite, the chefs world-class, and the bartenders like old friends. Wouldn't trade this place for the world. Truly my favorite spot in all of Madison and not a thing I would change about it. Wish I could give it 10 stars."}
{"text":"Love the updated menu. I've had 3 of the sandwiches over the past 3 weeks. Every one of them was good. Most recently there with colleagues from out of town. Great service and food. All my friends thought the whole package was great."}
{"text":"The first time I came a few years ago, I got the steak frites. It was hard to chew and too dry. If you're the type who loves to eat meat or steak because it's meat or steak, then it's a good deal for lunch. 

I went there again recently for dinner as a vegetarian and got a sandwich. I got the avocado BLT without bacon. It came with bacon. I didn't complain and just took it out and ate half of the very plain sandwich. It wasn't exciting so I focused more on talking with my friends. My vegetarian friend also got a salad because she couldn't find anything that looked good. Their menu is primarily meat dishes or sandwiches. I wish they had more hearty or creative vegetarian options which seems to be normal on most menus these days. 

Lunch hour was very quiet and empty. 
It's the kind of place that gets a loud buzz when a lot of people are there so I couldn't really hear my friends. I wouldn't suggest taking a date there during the weekend. 

The ambience is that of an upscale pub which is good for Monroe street."}
{"text":"The beer selection is wonderful. The food....   truffle fries were the best I've ever had. The summer v burger was small and not worth $12. I want to mention that the two other people we ate with were happy with what they ordered and didn't share in my bummed attitude. In my personal opinion, this place is great for drinks or starters. If you are HUNGRY.... Don't go here."}
{"text":"I have been going to Bras V once or twice a month for years now and while the wait time is occasionally an annoyance and I have had one or two disappointing meals the beer and frites simply are unmatched in Madison.  

In particular the Belgian taps are the stars of the show, in my opinion if you are not ordering off the first page of the drinks list you are doing it wrong though their wine selection is supposed to be good I can not speak to that.  The price is steep, though as I tell my cheaper friends when you are drinking a super tasty 11% beer you do not need more than one or two.

The food has varied over time with some seasonal hits and misses.  The frites are the best in Madison, best I have had anywhere really and pretty much every french fry I eat is a mild disappointment comparatively.  For lunch the BLT is excellent and the turkey sandwich is sometimes quite good but is more variable.  For dinner the mussels are my current favorite though they seem much less intense than they used to, the broth used to be buttery and rich to the point of almost being too much, the last few times it has been much lighter.  I have also enjoyed the steak, it's not a fancy cut for the price but the sauce and side with it are quite good.  The burgers are quite tasty and refined though not quite as good as the Bad Breath burger at The Weary Traveller.

One thing I have not tried is the cheese/sausage plates.  From what I have seen they are not impressive for the cost and being a native around here I can have the same cheeses at home with money left over to buy an Abt12 next time I am at the Brasserie."}
{"text":"My advice : Stop whatever you're doing and go to Brasserie V, right now. 

This place is my ULTIMATE Madison fav, my never-fail go-to, and where I always, always bring visiting friends. Seriously, since moving to the area a little over a year ago, I've probably consumed 100 Caprese sandwiches from this place (shameless, I know.) Their beer selection is out of this world, not just in volume but it quality (I stick with a couple favorites but my boyfriend orders something new every time) and their burgers/sandwiches are the perfect combo of pub-chic + gourmet. ALSO, the service is really fantastic. The bar staff spend the right amount of time with you and are super helpful in their beer recommendations."}
{"text":"I'm not a local to Madison, but in my two visits to the city I came to Brasserie V. The first time I came I was with some friends and we had a nice meat and cheese platter. I marveled at the massive beer menu and was really impressed by this place. Later on in that same trip I ordered the Duck Club which was great.  

The next time I came to Madison I wanted to return and try the duck club again. We came 10 minutes too late and apparently I could order it anymore cause the lunch menu was over. I tried to persuade the bartender, but he said he couldnt do it. Instead i ordered the Salmon BLT which was great.

Overall Brasserie V has an amazing Belgian and German beer list and fantastic food. The prices are a bit steep and the service is kind of stand-offish and awkward, but that could just be my impression of Mid-Western folks... lost a star for not giving me the duck club"}
{"text":"Madison bars tend to have good American beers. Brasserie V has excellent world beers, focusing primarily on European producers."}
{"text":"3.5 star. 

I would like to diverge from previous stellar reviews on Brasserie V. It is a good restaurant. Definitely the best place for moules, frites, and Belgian beers in Madison. No question it is doing well on these aspects. But there is much for Brasserie V to improve. 

I have lived in Brussels for a period of time, so I am particularly thrilled that Brasserie V offers me an opportunity to reminisce my good old times. The beer selection is really comprehensive. You can even get lambic beer here! Really a gem if you are a beer fan. 

The entrees were less impressive. We had Moules et Frites, Black Cod, Duck Confit, and Angel Hair pasta. 

As many have mentioned, moules and frites are good. But maybe I am biased by my previous food experience, I thought the moules are good, but I expect more from a restaurant. This might due the inland geography of Wisconsin, making it difficult to source the best quality mussels. I have had much better mussels elsewhere. Fries are good. But after being to a pig in a fur coat, I hesitate to call this the best fries in Madison. That said, I still Moules+frites is the best entree we ordered. 

Duck and cod are standard, but the portion is on the small side. I am not sure about the idea of having pasta in a broth, thus not a fan of the angel hair I ordered

I have experienced inconsistent service. Had a great conversation with a bartender in my first visit last year, but in second visit, i did not sense hospitality from the waitstaff.

With $30+ per person bill, I think Brasserie V is slightly overpriced. 

I still like the place, and hope for better experience in my next visit. Hopefully by then I would update my review to a 4 or 5 star."}
{"text":"I was here last night and little out of my comfort zone. I think I'm about to get more comfortable with Monroe street if the rest of is as good as Brasserie V. I had a safe bet with a beer im familiar with St. Bernardus ABT 12, however I'm positive I couldn't have found something I didn't like or at least find interesting on their expansive beer list. Many different beers and countries of origin. I was impressed.

As for the food, like I said I was out of my element so I ordered another safe bet. I had the Fall V Burger. It was amazing, very fresh and I loved that it was on a ciabatta roll. I was also pretty pumped to see Nueske's bacon on the menu. I also saved the aioli from our frites starter and more or less spread that on everything else I could, it was great.

In all this is a great place, I'm going to be back with my beer snob friends who will die when they see the drink menu. The food made even a sheltered eater very comfortable. The inside is very nice too with a great wrap around bar."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by Brasserie V!  The food we ordered wasn't anything out of the ordinary (Smoked Turkey and V Burger) but both were absolutely fantastic. Everything was well-seasoned, and the portions were right on the mark. The beer selection was great, and the bartender that served us was really helpful and nice. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go to feel a little fancy but relaxed in a laid-back atmosphere. I've had many enjoyable bites here, and, of course, they have killer mussels. I was disappointed at my last visit, though, when I saw the scallop entree. Don't get me wrong, three large scallops is pretty generous, but...well...that was pretty much the only thing on the plate. The greens and puree were very small. Think of a frisbee with a drink-coaster sized meal on it. Maybe it was visually unappealing, but I definitely could have gone for a small bite after, too. I still love their food, and will be back (especially if their chickpea app comes back!) but would have appreciated a little more balance in the portion compared to other plates."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. I really do. It has a great beer & wine menu, its food menu always sounds so good, its frites really are delicious, but meh, it always disappoints. I went there for lunch today with a girlfriend who's moving out of town. It was her farewell-to-Madison lunch - a place she had been excited about going to (\"I've never been there!\") and man, what a disappointment.

First of all, service is a mess. Individual staff are very nice and friendly, but they all seem to have no idea what the others are doing. Confusion at the front of the house about whether we - and others - had been greeted yet, with the bartender apparently handling the hostess duties because she was too busy? It wasn't crowded at all but it took quite a while for our server to show up to take our drink order and then we waited 10 minutes for our drinks to actually arrive - and since we'd just ordered bottles of Crispin cider, you wouldn't think it would be that complicated. We were there for lunch - who can wait this long for drinks and food at lunch on a weekday, for pete's sake? 

Second, I have never had a grosser sandwich than their \"grilled zucchini\" sandwich. We both thought it was absolutely awful. The \"beet goat cheese\" was more like an unappetizing smear of pink all over the toast. The \"roasted bell peppers\" and \"grilled zucchini\" were slimy and oily. The whole thing tasted terrible and looked even worse. What a bummer. 

Third, any place that makes you sit with your dirty, finished plates in front of you for 20 minutes gets dinged big time in my book. We pushed our plates aside and then sat there, talking, with those messy plates in our way until I finally signaled to our server - who was chatting with another server at the bar - to ask if we could get our check. I shouldn't have to get your attention to get our check - especially not at lunch when you should anticipate that after an hour+, we probably need to get back to work. I shouldn't have to sit with dirty plates in front of me for 20 minutes. Aren't these basics at most restaurants?

I work fairly close to Monroe Street and am always looking for nearby places for lunch or after-work drinks/dinner. I wish this place were a better option."}
{"text":"I've been here many times for beer but last time I tried the food as well. We went for lunch. I had the smoked salmon blt. The sandwich was very good and the fries were excellent. The mixed greens side salad was unexciting but tasty. I'd definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"The selection of Trappist beer is enough. Sold! White truffle and parm frites. Friggin' awesome. Great service from friendly bartenders. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"When I was a young El, I often confused \"brassiere\" with \"brasserie\", but there's nothing but the breast, ahem, best served at Brasserie V.  Is that a letter or a roman numeral? Never mind. 
The only thing that could get me to ignore the frites with my sandwich was the lentils (and my faux attempt at healthy choices). Holy shit, those were good lentils. Cool, delicious, and with just a note of moral superiority. Exactly how I like 'em.

But yeah, if lentils aren't available, fuck the salad, imma eat my increasing weight in frites."}
{"text":"I've gone to Brasserie V many times.  The service is always great, the food is excellent (they have one of the best burgers I've ever tasted the V2 burger).  It can get a little warm, especially if you're in the back, but overall it's amazing.  They have literally a BOOK of all of the beers they offer.  And if you know nothing about beer, they'll ask you what you normally drink, and they'll find a fun one for you.  It's very personalized service, excellent desserts, and I love it.

As for the other complaints about space.... they're expanding into the old Premiere Couture next door so they'll be getting bigger!!!  Yay!!!  More Brasserie V!!!!

And a requirement, you MUST get the frites.  $4 for a cone with two different aiolis that change every night.  Best fries in Madison (we went fry hopping -- as opposed to bar hopping-- and tested all the fries in madison, these won, hands down)."}
{"text":"Brasserie V - what does the V stand for? My most recent vice.

My criteria for a good restaurant (in order of importance):
1. Beer
2. Food
3. Service

WARNING: This place is hopping, so be ready for a wait, but it's well worth it!

The beer selection is phenomenal.  Belgian beers are infinitely complex and notoriously delicious.  Add to that an entire book of beer choices and you have an impossible decision to make. Luckily, Brasserie V's staff is knowledgeable and friendly, ready to help you make such a critical decision.

The food is SOOOO GOOOOOOD. I have never had anything I didn't love here.  Moules, frites, burgers, chicken or tuna salad sandwiches at lunch - variety with quality. I'm actually on their wifi right now, writing this review, and eating tonight's special: a burger with egg, crimini and oyster mushrooms, and rosemary and truffle bernaise sauce on sourdough. Only $13! Oh shit. The guy next to me just got the duck breast with door county cherries and red wine sauce. I guess I have to come back tomorrow.

The service: this is why I'm a regular. I live nearby and the staff is so much fun that I'm content to hang out at the bar and chat them up for a few hours while they endow me with sample upon sample of whatever 4 new beers they have on tap this week."}
{"text":"Very good food. Glad they expanded the restaurant. The original version of their burger is much better than the second version. The patty is very flavorful."}
{"text":"O.m.g.  The burger I had here served on ciabatta bread was one of the best burgers I've ever had in any city.  The pommes frites are amazingly delicious too.  Top notch rotating beer selection.  I usually write longer reviews, but the only thing that really needs saying is GO HERE NOW!!!!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers from Belgium and craft beers from the United States and Wisconsin."}
{"text":"The perfect Thursday night out. Friendly local bar and restaurant. The frites are amazing and so is most of the menu. Spectacular and extensive beer list too. Double sided bar area opening into more seating. They have a record box for listening to old vinyl too. Good service and a fun staff! Great for small groups or a date night."}
{"text":"Excellent! My husband and I popped in last minute, and we were not disappointed! It was bustling but we were able to find a seat at the bar right away, and we ate there. We both had sandwiches, and they were absolutely fantastic!!! I expected it to be good, but the food was so much better than I expected!!! I had the zucchini sandwich with beet goat cheese, and it was phenomenal! Along with the ham and lentil soup! We would definitely return! Great staff too!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had an excellent experience tonight on what will be the first of many visits to Brasserie V. We arrived for dinner shortly after 6pm to a bustling, but not crowded, restaurant (a good sign to us). They don't take reservations, and the hostess told us it would be about 45 minutes for a table, so we put ourselves on a list to be seated at the first available spot--table or bar. Only about 15-20 minutes later, we were escorted to a great spot at the end of the bar, where we received wonderfully relaxed and attentive service, GREAT food, and my husband enjoyed, um, several selections from their wide range of non-standard beers (and a cucumber dry soda for the pregnant among us, ahem).

Service: Surprisingly calm wait staff overall. From our stellar people-watching perch at the end of the bar (right by the wait station), they seemed to work like busy bees when they were working, and then drop into a lower gear until something else required their attention. No busy-bodies, no curt tones, no snippiness. Awesome. I told the waitress I was unable to eat unpasteurized foods (so none of their homemade aiolis, unfortunately). She offered other sauce options without batting an eye and pointed out the unpasteurized cheeses on the board before we even had to ask.

Food: We were feeling snacky, so we went for the frites (of course!) with pistachio oil and parmesan, the cheese board (two from Carr Valley plus St. Andre triple creme - yum), and their to-die-for scallops. Seriously amazing! Perfectly prepared (finished with what I'm guessing was a torch, just for giggles) and served on top of whipped cauliflower, a frothy butter sauce, yummy warm cherry tomatoes, and crispy prosciutto. Our waitress's reaction to our approval indicated that, yup, they're always that perfect. :) Winning.

Beer: I can't say how the beers were from personal experience, but my husband looked to be enjoying himself. :) We marveled at their selection and that we had only seen about 10% of their line-up before. So fun to try new things!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Madison. It's a good departure from the standard Wisconsin fare of burgers and cheese curds. 

I have been here about three times and have tried the moules et frites, duck breast, and the whole fish (it's seasonal, I think). Moules are standard (i.e., good) and frites are thin-cut and great. The duck breast has a citrus flavor and comes in a delicious sauce. There is also a large beer selection. Service is friendly and prompt. Prices are very reasonable. Portions are relatively generous. 

Weekend nights are crowded, but never more than a half hour to forty-five minute wait for me. 

The ambience is good for both couples and small groups."}
{"text":"Wonderful service by Josh at the bar. He was so knowledgable and friendly. We love sour beer and they have an awesome selection. A huge selection of other things to try too! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We really like this place  My wife and I had dinner here on Sunday night. I had the pheasant and she had the scallops. Both meals were excellent. The pheasant was moist and the skin was crispy. The sauce, vegetables and sweat potato that accompanied it were perfect. Sunday's are half price bottles of wine and we had a good Cote Du'Rhone. We split the chocolate yogurt desert which was also very good. Our waitress was very nice and polite and she spent some time with us explaining the menu and dishes. We will definitely go back here the next time we are in Madison."}
{"text":"Went as the lone guy with three attractive women to try and impress them, despite having brother status to two, and husband status to the third. It worked anyway.

They loved the atmosphere, decor and wine selection. I love the Belgian beers, and later went off course to try a banana mead and a watermelon ale. The bartender figured out my tastes quickly and plied me with samples. Totally my weakness. Everybody got what they wanted.

I've been here 4 times, and the food is great. People are friendly. Service was good. It's busy for a reason. If I lived closer, it would be dangerous.  My only downer is parking can be tough, and the prices are higher than I want for a neighborhood bar. They are trying to be a foodie destination instead."}
{"text":"Been there like three or four times, each time it's great.  I think I had the mussels with chorizo once and was like \"so what\" but every other time it's been a really good meal.  I really like their bolognese with the pepper farfalle.... it's really about as good as that could be.  The frites: above average, not perfect... but honestly that isn't a magnet to me anyway.  The beers: excellent.  They're heavy on the Belgian selection as they should be, but there's always a couple I haven't had before... come Grand Cru or this or that.  Sometimes it's pretty busy... I'd recommend eating early, there isn't a lot of tables there.  I dunno how people go 2 stars on this, seriously... I mean I think 3 is starting to get bad.... 2, really?  Maybe if you don't like beer... but that's like going to a pizza place knowing you hate pizza.  How many times you been there... try it again, goddamn."}
{"text":"Yum! Brasserie V is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. I had it bookmarked for far too long and am so glad that I've visited.. multiple times.

The food here is amazing. Truffle frites. Get 'em. The regular frites are great, but the truffle frites are outstanding. They are a great appetizer to share and for a fair price ($7) given how plentiful they are. Divine.

My favorite meal here is the original V Burger. It's smothered in muenster cheese, onion straws, spinach, tomato and aioli, with some high quality beef. I'd tie this burger as best in Madison, next to Sardine's house burger. It's that good. I always order more frites with my meal (generally comes with chips, mixed greens, or the daily side) because I can't get enough of them for just a small up charge. By the looks of their menu, and thanks to mouth-watering pictures on yelp, they also have a burger that comes in different variations with the change of seasons.  

I'm not much of a drinker but it'd be a shame to dismiss how impressive Brasserie V's beer selection is. Like 250 beers impressive. They also have lots of wine."}
{"text":"Went to Brasserie V for lunch the other day, and while we had to wait awhile to be seated (they are a small place), the wait was well worth it.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna sandwich, and it was amazing.  The tuna was perfectly seared, the bread fresh and crispy, and the aioli was the perfect complement to the sandwich.  It was served with fresh mixed greens that were in perfect condition, and with a lovely dressing.  All this for only $10!  My colleagues were equally pleased with their choices.  I will come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Take a ride over, you won't be disappointed. The Braised Beef Short Ribs are fantastic.  The new spring menu comes out in a couple of weeks.  We will return, with friends."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: we did not try the food on this visit.  
Last evening, a group of us were in the neighborhood and decided to stop by for an after-dinner drink.  This was a mistake.  This is not the type of place where you can stop in for a drink to round out the night.  You should be prepared to wait, even at the bar.  
My wife and the rest of our group sat at the window while I went to the bar to get drinks.  The place was moderately full but by no means slammed for the adequate amount of staff working.  I stood at the bar, with my debit card in my hand and the drink menu in front of me for what felt like nearly ten minutes.  There was no acknowledgement from anyone behind the bar.  It's like the staff was attempting to avoid eye contact as the stools to my left and right were both empty and I was obviously standing there, waiting for service.  
When a bartender finally came to my attention, there was no apology for the wait.  I ordered two beers, a glass of wine and a glass of water (for my pregnant wife).  The water came straight from the tap without ice or a straw.  Also, you'll need a PhD to navigate the beer menu, which could be a good thing if that is what you are looking for.  
I will not be returning, even if someone were to tell me it is the best food in Madison."}
{"text":"came here to enjoy a few drinks before the basketball game.  Was relieved that it wasn't packed and that we could get some good beer and an appetizer.  We order 3 different 4-oz pours of delicious tap beers.  It was fun to try something new and not get a full 8oz.  Also order the Frites.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to Brasserie V last night for dinner. 

The good:
-Service was nice.  Very friendly waitress who was adequately attentive.
-Ambiance was nice.
-Great beer list with some really nice imports on tap.
-The fries were great.  
-The duck confit was really nice.  Perfectly cooked with a crispy skin and the garlic polenta was amazing.  

The not so good:
-The House-Made Cavatelli was really a disappointment.  It looked and tasted like Hamburger Helper.  The pasta was fresh but overcooked and the sauce really didn't taste very good.
-The chorizo on the duck didn't make sense and was WAY too overpowering.
-The wine list when compared to the beer list is a bit lacking.  They could do something like wine on tap (using an argon system) to set themselves apart from other restaurants.


Overall I will go back and recommend it, but they really need to rework the Cavatelli. 

Yelp's price range of $$ is a bit misleading.  Dinner for two: 1 appetizer, 2 drinks, 2 entree's and no dessert came to $73 (includes 15% tip)."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, cute/romantic ambiance with all the Christmas decorations up. Went there because my friend had said these were the best fries in Madison.

Went there for date night and tried the following:

Couple beers - I wasn't a fan of my first selection, and they switched my beer on the house.

Truffle frites - good texture, great aioli dips, but not much truffle flavor at all. 

Chicken pot pie - the flakiest crust I have ever tried with a creamy perfectly flavored filling. Would definitely recommend if you are craving some comfort food.

Fall V burger - a sweet (not savory) beef patty with honey, Brie, and pear. Just an average burger, not anything too special."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch. Service was quick and efficient, maybe a bit too much, I felt rushed in placing my order. Beer list was long, I had the German Kolsch beer with my summer salad. Beer was cheap, but the salad was rather pricey without any meat. My husband and son both liked their burgers. The frites was yummy."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time. I ordered a club sandwich and a lox sandwich for pick-up. Ordering over the phone was a breeze and my order was ready when they said it would be. 

Upon entering the restaurant I was already in love. Wish I would have stayed to dine-in. The bar area and seating was roomy and they had a lot of beers on tap. The restaurant was lightly dimmed and I saw they had dessert on the chalkboard menu, which I must come back and try. I'm all about my desserts. 

The sandwiches were both delicious. I ordered them both with a mixed green salad, which came with this mustard-ish honey dressing; not sure if they have other options, as I wasn't given any, but it was yummy. The sourdough bread on the sandwich was perfect and definitely my favorite part. I have a feeling you can't go wrong with anything off their menu. 

Great, friendly, and fast service."}
{"text":"This is a gem in Madison. The food is always delicious and the service quick and friendly.
A special shout-out to lunch here! They have a full menu but you can get a half sandwich and a cup of soup for $7. This is homemade gourmet \"Belgian\" food. 
I had the smoked turkey with bacon, avocado and red-onion on sourdough sandwich; there was a great spicy mayo in there too. Plus a cup of the spicy Crawfish soup. YUUUM. Happy girl on a cold winter day. Or was it the glass of Pinot Grigio that made me happy?
I have also tried the BLT and the smoked salmon sandwich too. All fantastic.

If you have not tried their V (vee) burger- you must. as well as the moules/mussels (flown in every day).

You may have noticed, I resisted the frites (just watching the winter waistline)-- but YOU should get them. They are PERFECT.

As other reviews note- it can get very busy at dinner time- so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch at Brasserie V this winter on the recommendation of a foodie friend.  Comfortable atmosphere, good food, and reasonable prices.  It was one of the coldest days this winter (balmy high of 2 degrees that day) and it was a good place to get out of the cold and grab some lunch.  They were able to seat us at a table right away.  They seated us toward the back near the kitchen, which wasn't ideal but wasn't too noisy.  The service that time was prompt and friendly.  I had a smoked salmon BLT and frites.  Unfortunately we didn't indulge in any of the drinks, which is what this place is known for.  The person I took to lunch liked the atmosphere and seemed pleased with the food (smoked turkey sandwich).  

A few weeks ago, went back with some family and was actually pretty disappointed.  It was a Sunday night and wait was 45 minutes.  When we finally did get seated, we ordered milk for the 2 year-old, only to be told that the restaurant does not carry milk, only cream.  Seriously?  The food took FOREVER to come out.  The child's bedtime is between 8 and 8:30.  We arrived there at 6:15 thinking that would be plenty of time.  We didn't leave until after 8:30 because of the slowness of the service.  

The parking is difficult, similar to all the businesses along Monroe St.  Won't be going back.  Ever."}
{"text":"Um, first of all, let me say this--$21.00 for unlimited mussels and frites. Are you kidding me?!

We tried all three broths--the awesome classic, the St. Bernardus wit, and the final one made with Jordanal farms sausage. All three were delicious, and excellent.

The frites were fresh, crispy, and delightful. NEVERENDING EVERYTHING.

I'm stuffed. Near the end, we noticed that a lot more of the mussels were closed, rather than open--it's a sign that they were probably cooking them too quickly. That's where the star comes off.

Everything was great, though. I have less than a week left in Madtown, and I'm thrilled Brasserie V was one of the stops."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. As other patrons have written, they have the best fries and the best beer selection in town. This alone is enough to make Brasserie V a destination. 

Make no mistake though, this is a small bar and it's often crowded. When you add slow service, a visit during a prime eating hour can seem excruciatingly long.

Their burgers are more of an old-fashioned 'chopped steak' on a bun. Very un-burger-like, in that they're lean and meaty instead of greasy. But they're great. Fries come with two rotating aiolis and are delicious home cut double-fried delicacies, crispy on the outside, soft and pillowy on the inside. The mussels with fries is worth ordering, though I don't think their take on shellfish is anything spectacular. 

They have a superb selection of Belgian beer here, one to rival big-city gastropubs."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection, excellent food. 
A little on the pricy side, but you get what you pay for. 
Great moules frites, wonderful sour selection. Its the sort of place you can order anything off the menu and its going to be great. 
Service and decor are A+"}
{"text":"Went with a friend on a weeknight, early, a tad before 6 p.m., so there wasn't too big of an issue for parking. Streets/sidewalk still filled with snow, but hey, it is Wisconsin.

I would have liked to have tried a beer, but I wasn't in the mood, however the list is extensive an a beer snob would be very happy.

My friend and I ordered the moules frites to share with plans to order more food. While it tasted fine, towards the end of my meal and for the rest of my night I felt like I had been punched in the gut. 

We walked out and I said one thing to my friend, \"if that waitress had a wee bit of humor or an outgoing attitude, she could make a killing in that place on tips\". And had we had that kind of service I would have left a $20 tip for a $32 bill. Instead, I left a comfortable $6. Seriously, can't anyone train these yutes to service people, upsell, and ultimately make a killing on tips. 

I'm so tired of that. Come on people-"}
{"text":"Brasserie V is a staple in the Monroe street area. It's been around for a while (at least 8 years? Don't quote me on that) and there are a few great constants.

1) Their beer selection.
Wowza, this makes me want to come here in and of itself. They have a good size tap list with beers I've never even heard of from places like Spain and Denmark and much more. You can order 4.5 oz glasses as well as a full pint of the on tap stuff so you can try more than one easily. Haven't been disappointed yet with any beers I've tried! They also have an extensive selection of bottled beers if none of the taps strike your fancy.

2) Their food.
Now, I'd come here for point 1 alone, but what makes this place even better is the food! It's not standard \"bar food,\" it's better. Their moules and frites are my favorite choice always (mussels and fries for the uninitiated). Their tender, PEI mussels always taste fresh and perfect, with some nice frites and aioli to top it off. I would say I've tried other entrees... But I don't think I have. It's that good. I had a great tomato basil soup last night though! And my friends like the burger.

3) The ambiance.
Lots of wood, and a nice warm vibe. Service is good, and the bartenders are very knowledgeable. I'd take a date here!

It can be hard to park depending on the day and time, and sometimes the meals can be a little pricey, but overall a great place to have dinner with friends!"}
{"text":"We were outrunning a derecho in my 2004 Saturn Ion, coming from Iowa County in the west.  Madison, home to a phenomenal restaurant scene, was where we stopped for lunch.

Brasserie V was open a little later in the afternoon on a Monday in June.  It had a super deep beer list, featuring not only Wisconsin's finest, but also many rare Belgian beers.  The frites were calling.

The frites here are perfect vehicles (unlike Saturn Ions) for the herby mayo and aoili that accompany them.  I also had a rich pastrami reuben with acidic apple salad.  Then we had to get back in the car to race the storm.

Brasserie V is one of Madison's great neighborhood restaurants."}
{"text":"HORRIBLY UNPROFESSIONAL. I made a reservation for my 22nd birthday and when I got there, they said they had no idea what I was talking about and that they don't take reservations. I had spoken with an employee there 4 hours beforehand and she assured me that the table would be prepared for our reservation at 7 pm. Not only were they unprepared, they were also extremely condescending, saying that there's no way someone took my reservation and insinuating that I must be lying to them. They made us wait OVER AN HOUR for a table on my birthday even though I'd made a reservation. 

When I spoke to the manager about this disaster, he was horribly insulting and patronizing, and his only token of reparation was ONE order of frites (the cheapest appetizer) for the 11 people in my party. Not only that, but the server forgot to put in one person's order, so while we all got our food, he had to wait 10+ minutes for his food. Unacceptable. 

This was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had and my friends and I will never return. They certainly do not care about customer satisfaction, considering a simple offer of a round of drinks and an apology was all it would've taken to make amends for the false information I had received."}
{"text":"Disappointing, service inattentive and food was not good. \"Frites\" that were offered were small broken end pieces of potato. Dipping sauce that came with calamari looked like it was \"used\" cup from a previous customer - food pieces and dipping marks in the sauce container that was presented to us as new out of the kitchen (yuck)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for beer--the only place I can get a La Chouffe Beer in Madison.  Have the frites!  The soups change frequently and are excellent.  I have had almost every entrée on the menu and I have not been disappointed yet.  

Only drawback is that it gets a little noisy-and they do not take reservations, so on a Thursday through Saturday, you need to get there early, or take a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"Similar atmosphere to Jac's down the street, but the food is much better. Also, excellent selection of fancy beers. Very small restaurant! Love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We're regulars here. Love the fresh European style food and endless list of tasty beers. I really appreciate the healthy kids menu. Highly recomend!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend.  The atmosphere is friendly.  It is small and crowded but we ended up sitting at the bar.  I ordered the Croque Monsieur and let me tell you...IT WAS REALLY TASTY!   The fries were really good as they were seasoned just right.  Our bar tender was really nice and attentive.  I willl return when I come back to Madison!!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place in Madison!  They upgraded that Belgian salad and I loved it!  Got a yummy piece of bacon in every bite.  Dressing was perfect.  Soup was fabulous, mussels and frites outstanding.  Server was attentive.  Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"We popped in here for a few drinks after dinner.  So I have yet to eat here.  However, I can not wait!

The service was impeccable.  The bartenders were fun, knowledgeable and fun to converse with.  

The beer list was amazing!  PAGES upon PAGES!  Decent prices for the beers as well.  A half liter for a German doppelbock was $6!  Wow!  

I had an Augustiner Helles which is nearly impossible to find in the states.  They have the glasses that match the beer and just overall delicious options.  Ciders?  Try the six pear ciders they have in bottles."}
{"text":"We were there on 4-20 in the afternoon and 2 of us had the Seafood Rice soup. WTF???? How is is possible to make a soup so bland??? Did you break into a hospital & steal their soup recipes???? I haven't recently had surgery, I can handle spices... I swear!!!!  It wasn't just me, my cousin felt the same way. It was like cloudy water with 1 tiny shrimp and occasional carrots.

I also had the half a sandwich of turkey which I think when I said hold the dressing also meant hold the turkey. It had all the fixings and 1 tiny piece of lonely turkey. I was sad to eat it because it looked so tiny and fragile. 

My husband ordered the full sized turkey sandwich and wasn't quite sure what he got but he found it delicious enough not to say anything about it till after the meal.

We had the mussels and they were excellent with a superb taste (clearly not made by the person making hospital soup). Our server was also excellent, friendly, funny and on top of everything, so it was a bit confusing."}
{"text":"This is another \"can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet\" place. Brasserie V has been one of our favorites since they opened. Foremost for me is the beer selection, which is one of the best I know anywhere, and I'm a bit of a beer hunter. Belgians are their forté, but they source great brews from all over the world. The staff knows their stuff, too. I never hesitate to follow their recommendations. You don't even need a taste, just go with it. 

The food is just as good as the beer, with a traditional brasserie menu that's very well executed. The V burger, steak frites, and moules et frites are favorites."}
{"text":"Was not that impressed. Had a bowl of the flavorless squash soup followed up by a chicken entree. The chicken entree was floating in an unappetizing amount of water. Taste was unremarkable for this entree also. There are far better restaurants on Monroe Street."}
{"text":"There was just nothing not to love about Brasserie V.  

We had a table of 6, with only 5 people arriving on time.  Our missing friend ended up being about 45-60 minutes late, and we did not order food until the latter half of that time frame.  Sure, we ordered beers, but we felt bad about absorbing a lot of table space on a busy Saturday night.  The waitstaff didn't even give us the stink eye.  They were pleasant (downright friendly, even) and professional.  

Allow me to rhapsodize about their beer selection.  I was overwhelmed and elated by it.  I'm pretty sure that I have never seen such an extensive beer list.  They have something like 10-15 Belgian beers on tap (and, like, 50+ in bottles), complete with the appropriate fancy glasses to serve them in.  I am kind of a whore for drinks being served in the correct glass (which was my one beef with Tex Tubb's margaritas--a rocks glass?!  Come on!).  I would highly recommend the \"Saxo\" and \"Poperings Hommel Ale.\"  That Poperings....man, oh man.  It was the most perfect beer I've ever tasted.  All of the beers that my dining companions had (both dark and light) were also phenomenal.  I'd also like to point out that, if you request it, you can get as many samples of the beers on tap as you'd like.  Seriously.

I tried Moule et Frites and in no way was I disappointed.  They bring you a medium-sized mixing bowl full of mussels, drowning in a garlic-butter sauce.  Cue drooling here.  They then plop down a huge metal cone full (FULL) of perfectly cut, spiced, and cooked frites.  Oh, sweet jesus.  While I was face down in my bowl of mussels, I heard things like, \"This steak is $@*&$!% fantastic,\" and \"Ohhhh, the beer braised kale.\"  Nobody was less than 100% enamored with their food.

On top of everything else, the place is charmingly decorated.  It's cozy and warm and beautiful.  I love it and need to go back right away."}
{"text":"Nice environment. Great food and not a bad price. I'd highly recommend the v burger and the frites appetizer. But the service could have been a little more prompt...."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I LOVE this place. But a recent bad experience left a bitter taste in my mouth. Went on 8/17, and was told they had a limited menu based on \"kitchen problems.\" OK, no big deal. As long as there is cheese and beer, I'm good. My date and I wanted to linger and order several courses and beers, but when we ordered, we were forced to order all of our food at once. While we stressed several times that we wanted everything to come separately so we could enjoy the food and beer at our own pace, all of our food came at once, and very shortly after we ordered. Uncool. A table full of cheese, frites, and burgers, getting cold before we could get to it all; not the leisurely dining experience we wanted at all. When we complained, we were told that the dishwasher was broken and they were trying to push food out as quickly as possible. What?? So basically you're telling me you're purposely trying to push customers out the door as quickly as possible? If I wanted fast food, I would've gone to McDonald's. To make matters worse, our waitress immediately took our beer menu away; guess I'm not having another drink? And even though we complained, nothing was done to make it right--nothing comped, no discount, and frankly, a very insincere apology. WTF? Brasserie V?! If \"kitchen issues\" kept you from providing the quality dining experience I've come to expect from your establishment, you should not have opened."}
{"text":"LOVE the amazing selection of quality beers and fabulous recommendations from an attentive and knowledgeable bar staff!! This lovely neighborhood hangout is so comfortable and inviting! The Truffle Frites are a great app to go along with sampling any of the pours. Parking can be tricky and a bit of a walk, but definitely worth it! I like sitting at the bar best for the overall feel, but there is great space for small groups or tucked in spots for quaint and cozy gatherings. This is just an overall happy place to be in!!"}
{"text":"We were here for drinks and as such didn't sample the full menu this trip, but the Croque Monsieur was very much on point. Our friend ordered the Patat Frites which came with the correct sauces! The knooflok is tough to find stateside, but it was very authentic.

Their beer menu is legit and covers most of the major Trappist selections you'd expect. Additionally they had some of the smaller Dutch and Belgian \"brouwerij\" including one of my favourite Amsterdam-based Brouwerij 't ijwitt.

We will be back...often...It is the first place outside the Benelux that left us a taste of our other home."}
{"text":"I am sure a three star will surprise some, so let me start at the end by starting they lost a full star for service (or the lack there of) and the value (too much price for too little).

I decided to explore and hit the Brasserie V this evening. It was recommended by a couple I had meet at Ale Asylum and had good reviews on Yelp.

I was eating light, thus only ordered an appetizer, the Belgium meatballs; they are absolutely delicious...all 4 of them (value issue).  The beer I chose, a Scotch Ale on tap, was also delicious as well, all 10 oz for 11$ (value issue).  So food and beer was great, but that darn value issue.

The service was sub-par, as it felt like I was wearing my cloak of invisibility.  I sat at the bar and waited about 5 minutes to be acknowledged and it was not that busy.  After getting a menu, it was not too bad to place my order, but I really think she forgot about me as she poured several beers other beers before mine.  It was such a gap that the other bartender asked if I had been waited on. Then the worst service came after I had finished by food and my beer.  I did not see the bartender for 10 minutes and I finally flagged her down and just got the check.  

I may try again.  Good service would have partially overcome the value issue."}
{"text":"Friday night at 7 pm:  this place was packed with a 30-40 minute wait.  While some may frown over hearing about a wait, I actually am tickled by such things because this tends to foreshadow what is to come.

Within a minute, my wife and I found a pair of open seats at the bar.  The place glowed with lacquered wood, mirrors, and glass.  The bartenders were ultra friendly and provided us with plenty of attention.  The noise level was elevated there but not overwhelming given the full house.  We carried a normal conversation without having to repeat ourselves.

The food was outstanding.  We ordered the Belgian Meatballs, 3-cheese board, and the Apple Swiss sandwich with side salad.  My wife instantly fell in love with the sandwich.  She added some of the bleu cheese from the cheese board to her salad.

The mushroom sauce with the meatballs stole the show.  Not only was it creamy and earthy, but it had a mysterious sweetness to it that I learned was from baked black garlic.  I used the thin slices of crunchy baguette to sop up every last drop.

The cheese board we ordered contained nuts and honey, Granny Smith apple slices, thin-sliced baguette, crackers, Moody Blue, Hooks 10-year cheddar, and manchego.  The wine list was a wee short, but we found our individual wine selections paired well with the food we ordered.

My wife visited the lady's room, and she reported it was very clean.

In summary, we fell in love with this establishment, and we cannot wait for another opportunity to visit."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time finally after hearing about it so much. First thing I noticed when I walked in was how good it smelled. Always a good first sign. Staff was friendly. My server was fine. Of course there is a huge beer selection so that is a plus for many beer lovers. I got wine and was very pleased with my selection. I got the VIlla Barbi Rosso. I started with the creamy root vegetable soup. I love soup like this that is puréed. Very delicious not too creamy just perfect. For dinner I went with the steak frites. Frites are fantastic the garlic aioli tastes very lemony to me but still great. My steak was cooked just perfect I thought. Big portion. I would definitely come back to try more things."}
{"text":"We stopped in for late afternoon drinks, a plate of frites, and split the burger.  I was impressed from the moment we entered.  There was a chalkboard near the door which listed the names of the servers and bartenders for that shift.  That was a nice touch and I wondered why more places don't do something similar.  The bartender was friendly and attentive.  The beer was spot on and food was great.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What did Monroe Street ever do without Brasserie V?  I'm astonished at how unbelievably busy this place was straight out of the cage.  The beer selection is its signature and quite good.  The food is typical bistro and also quite good.  But seriously kids, buy yourself a few more restaurants in Dudgeon-Monroe.  The west-siders are desperate to EAT OUT.

Note: I'm adding an extra star here because I hear the chef bailed and opened his own restaurant down the street.  Poor form, dude."}
{"text":"Brasserie V offers a warm, cozy atmosphere and a high quality, unique beer list, making it one of the best places in town to hide when the sharp cold of winter rolls in.

I had the opportunity to finally try this legendary Madison restaurant when my parents came to visit, and we needed a place with tap options to eat. Upon arrival we were greeted by the hostess and told we would have a 45 minute wait. Okay, that was fine. We assumed there would be a wait because Madisonians hold this restaurant in such high regard.

The waiting space near the bar was crowded and we had to ask for a menu and drink list to keep ourselves watered during the wait. Unfortunately, neither of these were offered to us when we were told to hang around and wait near the bar.

The beer list was absolutely fantastic. While the list is not the largest in town, it may be the best assembled list. The variety, quality, and uniqueness of the beer available from Belgium and around the world makes ordering a difficult choice. There were around 8 beers I really wanted to try on tap. The bottle selection (200+) is absolutely massive and worth exploring on a future visit. The beer list is the primary reason for the four star rating. I would return JUST for more great tap beer.

Per Yelp's recommendation we got an order of frites (Not the ones with truffle oil... \"Do you know what we do with truffle oil? Throw it in the trash.\" -Jet Tila & Alton Brown). The fries were pretty average. While the sauces were interesting, I think the hype these fries had on Yelp left me disappointed. I had higher expectations from a restaurant sporting this kind of reputation.

For dinner, I had the Burger V with a side salad. The salad was a small pile of greens (where is the color?!) drenched in a very simple vinegar-lemon dressing. Again, I had much higher expectations from Brasserie on this item. There was no innovation. Disappointing.

The burger was very good but strange in some ways. The best part about the burger, by far, was the meat. The meat was very high quality from Scottish Highland Cattle, and I wish all my burgers used it! The burger came on sour dough sandwich bread and lacked any kind of interesting sauce. For having \"the best burger in Madison,\" I am left confused.

The service was slow, chaotic, and slightly strange. The server layout seemed spastic. Each server was assigned an individual table, but they all had tables scattered about. No one helped carry dishes out and multiple trips were made to bring items to the table. The end result resembled a pin ball machine with multiple balls bouncing about. Servers should have designated areas and work in teams with buses to bring a cohesive dining service to the guests.

Brasserie V has status quo food and fails to innovate with its menu. A restaurant of this caliber and reputation needs to innovate more with its menu items to avoid becoming stagnant. On the other hand, the beer list at Brasserie V is world class and worth returning for time and time again. I am torn writing this review. There are so many small issues, but the beer list delivers a truly unique experience."}
{"text":"Most definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. We came in around 7:30 on a Saturday night but I didn't mind waiting about 20 minutes for a table because of their awesome vinyl record booth. It's a cozy booth for two where you can choose from a selection of records and play them on the record player! It was super cool and fun. A great date night restaurant. 

Besides that, the food is amazing. We ordered the butternut squash soup, duck confit fritters, mussels du jour, and the pork chop. Everything was so amazing. The mussels are definitely worth trying there. It's a little pricey but the quality of the food is worth it. Overall I would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Brasserie V last night after a late afternoon movie.   It had been a while since our last visit, probably over a year.    There was an hour and a half wait but we were able to find a place at the bar and eventually decided to eat there.
The service was poor.   The bartending staff did a poor job of watching the status of drinks so we waited for a while when our glasses were empty.   The spots we secured at the bar had been occupied before us by diners.   But the staff didn't remove old plates, glasses and utensils until we asked.   And even then we had to ask them to wipe off the area.
The food was up to par.   Moules and frites were good, salad with duck was good according to my wife.
Overall it wasn't bad but the poor service made it a somewhat disappointing visit"}
{"text":"I have a girlie crush on this place.  It's the perfect spot for a quite night out. We have friends who like to go here with us and it's always fun b/c we share our plates and always have the best time.  We get the steak, 2 frites & mussels, sometimes a salad and app of choice.  The beer and wine selection is wonderful as well. And, I'm so happy that they have expanded and there is more room now!"}
{"text":"I was traveling out of town and stopped in because of the other yelp reviews. I had the spring V burger and daily side. It honestly was a runner up for potentially one of the best burgers I have ever had. I can't wait to come here again when I am in town. The restaurant was cozy, clean, and my hostess Alex was super friendly and gave me the recommendation on what to order. I highly recommend coming to Brasserie V!"}
{"text":"This place specializes in grilled sandwiches and fancy Belgian beer. It is always busy and for very good reasons: Fine (and sometimes rare) beers, excellent food, and fast, friendly service. My favorites: mussels and frites, any sandwich (seriously, any sandwich), their Belgian-style burgers (caution: they use aoli). Five stars, no question."}
{"text":"No complaints - and I loved the Shitake Mushroom sandwich!!  GREAT flavors!"}
{"text":"Two key things to know before getting to far into a review: 
1) They are a walk-in restaurant (no reservations)
2) They serve beer and wine only (though it is a very very extensive list)

We came here for the first time on a Saturday around 5 pm. There was a 30 minute wait for a table but spots were open at the bar. So my party of four sat at the bar, which I believe I would have preferred anyways over a regular table. We realized they had extensive beer and wine list. I had the Crispin Blackberry Pear Cider that I found enjoyable. 
We ordered some truffle fries to share as an appetizer. The fries were delicious on there own but the aioli dips they came with were so incredibly delicious! Making the fries with the dip a combination out of this world 
For my entree I tried the smoked Turkey Sandwich (cheddar, avacado, spinach, tomato, onion, and chipotle-lime aioli). I chose pub chips for my side even though I'm not typically a fan chips. But these chips were delicious and I also like to dip them in the aioli sauce from the frites. My husband had the V Burger (Fountain Prairie Farm Dry Aged Beef, Beer Battered Onion Straws, Muenster, Spinach, Tomato, Classic Aioli) on Sourdough Bread with pub chips and enjoyed it saying it had good flavor. My mother had the house special of Moules et Frites (Mussels, Garlic, Shallots, Chardonnay Broth) with the same truffle fries we had ordered as an appetizer. The muddled were delicious and it came with so many. The dish was $17 but we could about 35 muscles total in a cute little pot. About 9 were not open so my mom told the waiter and they brought her out  more then 9 more new ones. Their mussels special is a tasty and really good deal! My dad had the Roasted Cornish Hen (Fall Vegetables, Potatoes, Lemon, Thyme), he enjoyed it but since he's not a big vegetable eater he said the dish wasn't very big but the yen was good.
I would say the food itself was a 5 out of 5. The reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 was due to the service. They were pretty busy so I definitely understand why they couldn't be as attentive, however we sat right at the bar and are drinks were empty and non of the bartenders or wait staff that came by us asked if we wanted another or any water. And it was hard to get there attention because they were so busy. 
But I would definitely come back and eat here, the experience and the food reminded me of my trip to Belgium and their food and restaurants there :)"}
{"text":"***Okay...FIRST off, let me just say that this rating is based on the food and atmosphere alone, because I am NOT a beer girl. If I was, I'd probably dig it, because they have a very...VERY extensive selection.

We decided to have dinner here after I had a long hard day at work. I almost wish I had chosen another place just because it was soooo loud due to the lack of walls or sound buffers of any kind. This place is small, but they still pack in the people, and it was just a bit too much.

When we arrived, the hostess told us that they were having plumbing problems, and it would be about a half hour until we could order food. We decided to stick to the game plan and sat at a table. The waitress came to get our drink order and said \"Well, it could be a half hour, or an hour...who knows. Hopefully they're fixing it.\" Now, when you're hungry, there is a big difference between a half hour and a hour or \"who knows\". She did say that they could make frites, however. We decided to order those as a starter, but before we could even do so, she said that everything was fixed and the kitchen was open. YAY.

We still went for the frites to split, because we know they're known for them. I'm not sure what I was expecting on the menu...but nothing looked amazing to me(except the Moules et Frites) so I decided to go low-cost and  went with the Avocado BLT, subbing the chipotle-lime aioli for the regular mayo that it usually has. The sides were succotash, chilled red pepper soup, or potato leek soup. I love leeks, so I chose the latter.

The sandwich was okay, but nothing amazing--but a BLT is pretty much just that, unless it totally sucks.. Same for the soup. It was almost too thick. The frites were decent, and I liked the beet aioli that came on the side. Again, it was just so-so in a town with so many dining establishments that so-so doesn't do much for me.

I don't know if I'd ever go out of my way to dine here, but it was decent."}
{"text":"Such a classic for Madison. The beer selection is truly amazing! They have a great selection of all types of beer especially Belgians, my favorite. 

For dinner you can't go wrong with the mussels or the burger. They have a number of other incredible options but the mussels or burger are by far my favorite. Always ask what the mussels de jour is and if it sounds good, get that. Otherwise, the classic mussel are incredibly good. They come with frites and some yummy aioli, or you can always substitute for a salad or soup to be a little healthier. 

To add on to the good food, the service is always top notch and friendly. Whether you want to just grab a beer or go for dinner, this place won't disappoint and probably the best choice on Monroe."}
{"text":"3.5 stars to be precise.

Decor and First Impression : You enter at the bar area so you'd be forgiven to misconstrue it's true size. Follow the service folks and you'd find a much larger dining area at the back. The rather dim lighting and non flashy wall motifs sway a more romantic tune to this joint (Which is always a good thing!)

Food : Glance through their menu and you'd realize there is more \"finger\" food here than \"cutlery\". We ordered ourselves a Chicken Pate starter to kick things off. The presentation was beautiful and portioning perfect. The pate itself was seasoned just right, not too bland not too salty. The baguette slices were the right carrier for it and the pairing of almost compote like cherry really made this dish worth ordering! Tarty cherries with the mildly salty pate is tingle dance for your taste buds! I'd recommend this for sure.

Onto the \"mains\", we ordered a Smoke Salmon BLT sandwich and their Fall V Burger. The smoked salmon was generous and surprisingly went well with the bacon. The spinach was a better substitute for the otherwise obligatory \"lettuce\" in a BLT. All in all, a very good sandwich that came with a side of well made fries!

The Fall V burger was a tad more rare rare than medium rare. Nonetheless, the beef was of a fine quality and quite succulent. The bacon aioli was a much needed boost as the patty itself didn't have a lot of seasoning on it. Finally the slaw of Brussels sprouts was a very very good idea and so much more earthy to balance that beef.

To close, the food is above average and I'm sure their Entrees will be something worth trying to in future (note to self!)"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this stellar restaurant even though I have been here at least a half dozen times.  Now that we live in the neighborhood, I definitely see the visits increasingly.  Everything about BV is solid.  The restaurant embraces the brassiere concept-informal dining complete with great beer.  One of my favorites are the mussels and fries.  They always have two options-standard and du jour.  With either, you can't go wrong.  Served with some crusty bread for dipping, this is comfort food at it's finest.  The waitstaff and bartenders are warm and welcoming.  Giving the concept and BV's execution, it is no surprise on how popular the restaurant is no matter what day of week you stop by."}
{"text":"This was my fifth or sixth time here, and the food, drinks, and bar service were all great. The one glitch this time was our super-flaky server.
She was pretty inattentive and mumbled a lot. I also think she might have been avoiding us..? When she would take orders/refill drinks at other table, it seemed like she was deliberately avoiding making eye contact with us. I couldn't tell if it was that she was awkward, annoyed that we had ordered our drinks at the bar (less tip?), or just didn't like us (interracial, 1 dietary restriction, weren't ready to order as soon as we were seated).
The capper was dessert. After our plates were cleared, we ordered the raspberry pot de creme. And then we waited. And waited. Over twenty minutes later, I was about to get up to find her to cancel the order and just get the check instead when she turns up with the dessert. She kinda drops it on our table, mumbles a weak apology about the delay, and scurries off. All that was on the plate was a wee ramekin of chilled raspberry custard: no powdered sugar dusting, no sprig of mint, no tiny garnish of 3 or 4 berries, no drizzle of chocolate or fruit glace on the plate. Points for presentation are nil when you have a white plate with white ramekin with a nearly white dessert. I can live with that. The boy thought the dessert tasted absolutely great. But here's my question: if all she/the kitchen had to do was plop a ramekin on a freaking plate, WHY THE HECK DID IT TAKE 20 MINUTES??
I guess I'd go back because all my other experiences were pleasant, but I'd walk out of her section if I got seated there again."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on Valentines Day. Was very unimpressed. Atmosphere was great and waiter was attentive. We started with a potato soup that was tasty and then it went downhill. The frites were highly recommended. We were told they we're crispy and delicious they were neither, soggy and blah. We both ordered the haddock which was good but the serving was tiny perhaps 3oz. It sat on an unusual radish assortment that again was blah and not much there. We also had a red velvet cake & ice cream for desert which was delicious. We each had a soda. The bill came to $97 with tip. Now that was hard to swallow! If it had not been for the desert we would have left hungry. We do not plan a return visit. Not sure what the other reviewers were raving about."}
{"text":"Authentic Belgian food and beer with an upscale, quieter atmosphere.

Walking in here, it does remind me of Belgium. All wooden interior with two lengthy bars and pub-style mirrors. There is an extensive bottled beer list and also a small but well-curated draft list that included some very hard to find, excellent beers. I went for the Saison Rustique by Brasserie Dunham. Though Canadian, this Belgian Saison was out of this world good. That is to give credit also to the restaurant for caring for their kegs and draft system. It was served in correct glassware as well. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and the beers offered. 

I ordered what was clearly labeled as their house specialty, moules frites. The fries were a tad too sallty, but very tasty. The mussels didn't have enough sauce in the bottom of pot and the sauce was much too watery. It needed to be better seasoned and much thicker in my opinion. My wife had the butternut squash soup and liked it.

Overall, we had a nice time. The atmosphere was a bit more quiet, upscale, and intimate than I was expecting. I think it would do well as a date night sort of place vs. a beer drinking and quick eats gastropub."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was a classy, subtle elegance and dark wood decor.   The Belgium beer selection was top notch and stems to match. We didn't eat there, but I will definitely return for a meal. The french fries looked like they'd fulfill my addiction. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Wow! I did not expect the special creamy kale soup and Brasserie V Salad to taste as amazing as they did. My husband had the moules et frites which were equally delicious. Others at the table had the kale salad and a smoked turkey sandwich and all raved about them. Great beer and wine selection. Lots of locally sourced foods. My only complaint is the service was a bit slow at times. Overall, an excellent dining spot."}
{"text":"I don't know why Yelp has this place listed as being French.  This is classic Belgian food.  There is no question about that.

I went with the classic moules frittes.  And I was not at all disappointed.  The mussels were not overcooked and the the broth used to steam them was garlicky and rich.  The fries were hot and salty and came to the table in the classic funnel shaped server.  I started with something that was described by our server as clam stew, but it tasted more like Manhattan style calm chowder than stew.  It was good, but not spectacular.

My wife ordered an ample and beautiful frisee salad as her appetizer and the arctic char as her main dish.  The char came in two very large thick pieces and I am told it was spectacular.

We both tried different Belgian triples and the beer menu at this place was huge with lots of choice and this gave one the opportunity to compare similar types fro different purveyors.  The beers we ordered were delivered with glasses from the particular breweries they came from and they were terrific beers.  They were not cheap, but they certainly were good.

The meal came with nicer toasty sourdough bread which was a nice touch.

Unfortunately we had quite a long wait to be seated, and the place was packed when we arrived, while we ate and when we left.  In an area of town with lots of trendy places to eat, that this place was so packed and had so many diners waiting is an indication of how popular it is.

The next time I go back to Madison, I will go back here."}
{"text":"Our vusit was, by far, my worst dining experience in recent history. Both the service and food was terrible. We waited almost an hour for cold food. Although the dishes were comped, the whole experience was a complete waste of time, as we left hungry."}
{"text":"PROS:

- great beer selection, decent wine selection
- best fries, hands down
- cozy atmosphere
- enormous serving size of mussels

CONS:

- not being greeted at the door upon entering
- the 90 minute standing wait
- the very expensive wines and beers
- the grit in the prince edward island mussels (such a no no)

Overall...  great place to hit on a Friday night for drinks and fries at the bar."}

{"text":"Loved it!
Went for lunch and shared a salad, steak frites and a burger. Flavors were great. Homemade aiolis were really good (heart attack anyone?). Great beer selection. Fast waitstaff. Cute decor. Great for a date night or meeting friends for brunch."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. The apple and Swiss sandwich is delicious. I have been trying to replicate it at home and have yet to perfect the aioli and pesto. The frites and salad are also a must! They have different aiolis that they serve with the frites. Huge beer selection as well."}
{"text":"It's been far too long since I've been to Brasserie V, so I'm hoping writing this review will inspire a return visit on my part. I joined a colleague for dinner, and since we were on the early side we had no trouble being seated immediately. Service was prompt and friendly, and our server was kind in helping us decide what to order since there were some hard choices to be made. 

I ended up choosing the smoked turkey sandwich. Maybe not the flashiest, but I love a great sandwich and this was perfectly executed. Madison Sourdough bread held Neuske's smoked turkey, avocado, tomato, spinach, and cheddar (I skipped the onions) with a lime-chipotle aioli that gave the sandwich a little pizzazz. 

I obviously chose to upgrade to frites for my side since it's one of their hallmark dishes, and it was a great choice. They were crispy, well seasoned, and came with aioli that made them perfectly dip-able. 

Looking forward to giving their burger a try and having another go at those tasty frites!"}
{"text":"I can only speak to the quality of the beer selection and a couple appetizers. So let's start with the beer selection - it's amazing. The extensive beer menu is complete with nice little descriptions many of the beers. 

I've had the frites a couple of times. I'd recommend the porcini frites. Tonight we also had bacon. It paired really well with the frites. 

The happy hour vibe is really good - but you may have a hard time finding a seat at
5:30."}
{"text":"These guys know Belgium beer.  They are not fooling around.  They also serve the mussels and fries just like they do in Belgium.  NICE. The food was great, service was spot on and the beer selection was the best I've seen (for Belgium beers).   If you LOVE Belgium beer or just want to pretend like your in Belgium for the night you must try this quaint little bar with excellent food.  

We started with the cheese plate - all local Wisconsin Cheese - 3 types of local cheeses, all were great.  We paired that with a Corsendonk Angus and Blanch de Brussels.  

I had the Mussels with fries, the fries came with 2 rocking dipping sauces.  The mussels were great, cooked perfectly in a classic wine, garlic sauce.  My husband had the poached egg (sans the ham) and it was really a nice plate.  Perfectly poached egg on a bed of greens with Parmesan foam - Yes, Parmesan foam.  We paired this with Monk's Café Flemish Sour which was AMAZING and Lefebvre Hopus.  We ended the night with a 750ml bottle of 
Artisinal du Flo Cuvee du Flo. 

OK - theses guys do not play around with the beers, all the classic Belgium beers and some I've never had or seen in California.  If you find yourself in Madison, WI you have to find this place."}
{"text":"Brasserie V has an enormous beer list that focuses on Belgian beers and obscure beers (although they have some of the usual suspects, too). The bar staff are super knowledgeable and can help you out if you have any questions. 

Brasserie also happens to have the best frites in Madison and a super flexible lunch and dinner menu. If you just want a sandwich and a water, you can get out for under $10. If you want to go big, there are plenty of options for that, too. 

The only downside to Brasserie is that it gets pretty busy at night, especially later in the week. They recently expanded, which has helped quite a bit, and there's often space at the bar. If you're headed there on a Friday at dinner time, though, expect to wait--especially if you've got a group."}
{"text":"Avocado BLT or the Brasserie burger. Can't go wrong. Amazing frites.
Beer selection is obviously a strong point, but really pointed towards Belgian-o-philes. If you're a good ole fashioned pale ale fan, things are quite a bit more limited. Not impossible, but limited."}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights

1) TONS of beer options (as well as gluten free beer and cider!)
2) prepare to wait....awhile....on the weekends
3) great food!

Brasserie V rocks! The restaurant is located right on Monroe Street. There is a big bar that splits between the two rooms of the restaurant. Like most restaurants in Madison on weekends prepare to wait for a table. Our wait was about 90 mins when we arrived around 7pm on a Saturday. There is full menu service at the bar if you are eagle eyes enough to snag a few bar stools. 

There are TONS of beer options from all over. If you are with a beer connoisseur this is the place for them! There are also hard cider and gluten free beer options. The menu is American with lots of sandwich/burger options, salads, appetizers etc. Gluten free bread from Silly Yak is available to be subbed in. We tried the ham sandwich, a burger and frites. The food was great! 

The Monroe food scene is great and Brasserie V does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Brasserie V is very small and does not take reservations, so expect to wait for a table.  It's more of a bar than a bistro.  Food is fresh and good.  Had an excellent fresh salad, followed by the mussels and fries.  Portions are large.  We shared a salad, and after that, I was unable to finish the mussels.  The fries are great and abundant, and the two of us couldn't finish them.  (My husband chose to share my fries which he liked better,than the boiled potatoes served with his fish.). Earlier in the week, I had the mussels at Graze, and much preferred their interesting broth.  I wanted to like Brasserie V more than I did, because I'm a real fan of locally grown produce.  If they took reservations, I'd give it another try."}
{"text":"The frites are amazing. The cheese board is to die for, with a good variety of little things to nibble on. Good selection of cheeses. Every dish they make is well executed. They are even vegetarian friendly.

There's an enormous beer selection, specialising in Belgian. The staff are extremely knowledgeable about the beer. They actually taste them.

It can get crowded even early on a weeknight, but I've always been able to get a seat at the big bar right away, where there's full table service. It's kind of fun to sit there and watch the bartender share his beer knowledge with the customers and try to hunt down some obscure bottle.

I can't think of anything they could do better. This place is way better than Cafe Hollander.

edited to add: On Tuesdays you get $2 off beer bottles and $4 off 750 mL bottles!"}
{"text":"i find the fact that brasserie v's website opens with a definition of the word brasserie (an unpretentious restaurant) HILARIOUS. because if I could use one word to describe this place it would be pretentious.

i met some friends here for drinks last weekend. we only stayed for one drink because the prices were outrageous. this might not bother the monroe street richies, but i know that there are several other bars in this town that serve the same beers without hiking up the price.

to be fair, I didn't try the food... so i *might* come back if my pockets are feeling particularly deep. however, if you're on a budget, know that there are several other places in town that have a similar (if not altogether better and more reasonably-priced) beer selection."}
{"text":"I'm not a beer fan, but they have a list that will force you to find a favorite :-) I usually sneak in here for a quick lunch. I love their frites with aoli and  smoked turkey sandwich. Frites are perfectly fried Belgium fries served with 2 delicious aoli dips. The smoked turkey sandwich is delicious...like a party in your mouth.  I tried the V burger once - it was ok, nothing special.

This place is a must visit. My favorite bar in Madison, so far;-)"}
{"text":"PROS: Good food, good portions, good beer selection
CONS: Ridiculous wait times

We waited maybe 90 minutes for a table for 5, so that was rather infuriating. The fries were great, and the whole trout was cooked perfectly. I would return on a weekday night to beat the crowd though."}
{"text":"Peruse the menu at your discretion.  They went to great effort to get the Euro vibe right, complete with a formidable domestic and imported beer selection, with an emphasis on Belgians.  The food options range in scope from a well designed house \"V\" Burger to various entrees with a higher price point.  My previous review made mention of the friendliness of the waitstaff person I encountered, but the female server I had on this occasion had an attitude that was somewhere south of a \"sour apple\".  No matter, the food and drink was prompt and I didn't expect her to elocute her problems, as I was not really up for that."}
{"text":"Throwing itself into the solid 4-star category, Brasserie V does a fine job, a good job even, of providing a cool atmosphere with a good alcohol selection and even decent prices for burgers and sandwiches. All very cool ingredients and said burger is even delicious to boot! So wa-cha to that! 

Stop there, and you'll be happy. Get the truffle fries, and you'll wonder why you bothered. Get the entrees, and they'll be delicious too, though you'll also wonder why you paid twice as much as a sandwich.

A cool place that I wouldn't be mind finding myself in again."}
{"text":"I finally got the chance to check this place out and I was pretty impressed. The frites (French fries) are mentioned in a lot of YELP reviews so I had to try them! They do not come on the side for lunch. That said, they were excellent. Probably some of the better French fries in Madison. For my entree I had the Duck Breast Sandwich. The Bread was nice and thick and perfectly toasted. My only complaint with the sandwich was that the duck breast was quite rare for a sandwich and it made it a little chewy. Other than that, the service was great, the beer selection is awesome, and I would give it a try."}
{"text":"Classic Belgian/French brasserie dishes, moderately priced, but absolutely delicious! Well worth a visit for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This is a Monroe Street hotspot. Deservedly so, as it has the trifecta of good food, good service and a world class beer list. There's a beer for every taste and a knowledgeable staff that will help you navigate through the many choices. If you're undecided they have free samples.

I always order the moules (mussels) and frites (fries). They are the best in Madison and large enough to split. Today's lunch special was a halibut salad sandwich.  This was my husbands choice and he said it was refreshing and tasty served on perfectly toasted sour dough bread.

The servers are friendly and efficient and everything we've tried has been consistently good. 

The reason for only four stars? We were seated in the newer addition and it was very cold. No heat at all. The couple seated next to us put their winter coats back on. It turned what was to be a two beer lunch into a one and done."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday for lunch. We sat in the new area to the left. The place was empty but we were sat at this mini two-top in this awkward corner... 

Other than that, the place is great. They have individual serving size bottles of Champagne so its never flat which excited the wife. They also had a huge beer list including Topping Goliath PseudoSue which excited me. 

We got the mussels which were really good. There were tons of them and they were served in a pot on the table (wish we had more room). They came with Belgium frites that were really good but a little soggy...but I think they are supposed to be like that. 

On a whim, I got salad with duck breast on it which was better than I expected. The duck was cooked perfectly. Also a good sized portion but they served it packed in this tiny bowl so it didn't look like much and it was a little hard to eat at first (but we didn't have room for it at our table as it was). 

Two drinks, Mussels and a Salad w/Duck got to $50 a little faster than I thought but I think it was worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Madison! The truffle fries are the best in town. The beer selection is amazing. Every sandwich is delicious-I have never had a dish I didn't like here. The only downside is the wait on Friday and Saturday nights-but if you are willing to sit at the bar you can usually get a spot in 10-20 minutes. Definitely try this place if you are in Madison!"}
{"text":"Madison needs more gastropubs, it's true. Brasserie V is here to answer the prayers of the people. Great beer list, amazing and decently priced wines. Best mussels and frittes I have had in ages! Excellent service. And was the perfect setting for a romantic date! I will be back!

I'm getting hungry just thinking about that dinner, it was exceptional."}
{"text":"Well, all-frite then.

I don't know the last time I had  fries, pardon me, FRITES (as I was corrected when I *gasp* accidentally called them frites. Shame on me) like this. And by like this I mean, \"How fast can I get these in my mouth and is it embarrassing to want to lick the bowl of the remoulade sauce that came with them?\"

The beer selection is unlike most in Madison (which in my book gives them a big-ups).  I had the La Trappe WitteTrappist which was light beer (in my book anyway) made with wheat hops, and my dinner date had the Topling Goliath Brown Sugar which was a more complex beer with almond and chocolate notes. 

Besides the gut-busting batch of frites my dinner date and I inhaled, we each had a solid dinner as well, with my date going with the pork shoulder (yumz) and myself (the faux-vegetarian) going with the standard burger. After trying the pork shoulder and eating my burger, I have to wonder, why do I rarely consume meat? Maybe the two dishes consumed here were incredibly delicious, but I am re-thinking my self-imposed limit on animal flesh.

The pork shoulder was tender and cask that it came out in was appropriately hot. The pork shoulder was seasoned to perfection and the sauce that it was simmering was divine. The burger I had was cooked just how I like  my medium burgers to be prepared, and the aioli sauce that was served along with the burger was flawless as well.

The cons to my evening, parking. I feel like everyone always defaults to \"but its __________street though\". In this case, I want to say, \"Yea, but that's Monroe Street though\". Which is where it is located, but parking is disgusting around there. Especially when there is packed snow and ice everywhere.  Even at 8 pm on a Sunday night, be prepared to hike. And potentially fall on your keister. Evidently living near Monroe street entitles you to not to have to shovel your sidewalks. The other thing to make mention is that the hostess seemed either a bit confused, or flustered. The place was crowded but she seemed overwhelmed. We were told 30-40 min wait so we went to grab a beer. She found us, told us we'd have a table in 5-10 min. She walked 5 steps away from us, turned out, then came right back and said there was a table right now. I am not complaining about being seated right away, but a bit more organization would have been nice. I wouldn't have minded sitting at the bar consuming a delicious beer anyway. 

I'll be back. If for nothing else, the beer and the fries. Darn it. Frites."}
{"text":"This was my absolute favorite place to go for dinner (and one of my favorite lunch places) back when we lived in Madison. It's the perfect combination of not too fancy but not too casual, a great place to get an excellent meal but not spend too much money, it pays homage to Belgium while still staying true to Madison's focus on serving locally-grown food.

The V Burger is my favorite burger in Madison, and I always struggle trying to decide if I'm going to have that or one of their amazing regular items or specials. I'd say the V Burger won out more than three quarters of the time. It's hard to turn down grilled Madison Sourdough bread, local beef, onion straws, muenster cheese, and aioli. Paired with a salad and/or a side of pommes frites and whichever two dipping sauces they have for the day and that's an amazing, Euro-tastic meal!

Not in the mood for the burger like I was a quarter of the time I went there? They have great sandwiches (smoked turkey is great, so is their reuben if you're in for lunch) and moules frites. Their seasonal specials are also great. The one time we weren't happy with a meal was when my husband ordered a duck dish and the skin wasn't crispy enough. And I think one time I ordered a great polenta dish but was only disappointed because my husband didn't give me a bite of his V Burger =o(

Service is great. We've always been treated well.  And we've brought our kids many times and the servers are very understanding and accommodating. And the Belgian beer collection was excellent.

I can't sing the praises for Brasserie V enough. It does a great job of balancing so many different things and by doing so it excels and shows that it belongs in the circle of great restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"Came here for a casual business dinner. I pass this place on Monroe Street every day. Trust me, it didn't disappoint.

Our server, Hannah, was adorable...but she seemed new. She was polite and kind though, so the skills and menu knowledge will come in time. 

The menu looked great; small and to the point. Nothing worse than a Cheesecake Factory style novel menu selections. The beer menu was well established, although I didn't see any PNW beers (I'm from Seattle, what can I say). I also didn't see Guinness, which with so many rich beers, I would use as a palette cleanser (but that could just be me-it probably is). I will definitely bring my out of down friends here, as it is a quick walk from work."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and found it a very comfortable place with good atmosphere and great, although egregiously overpriced, beers and food.

I have to sink its rating because of my most recent experience. I've never submitted a yelp review but feel others should know, for the sake of balance, that this place on at least one night had flaws in its customer service game.

My girlfriend and I were looking for a quick Saturday night bite and beer. I called Brasserie V and they said that while the kitchen was closed for the night, they could still give us a cheese and sausage platter. Perfect. When we got there ten minutes later, the bartender apologized and said they were totally done serving food. I'm pretty sure it was the same woman I had spoken with ten minutes prior, and we had based our decision to go there on the promise of cheese and sausage.

She kindly offered to bring us what she described as the last loaf of bread and olive oil for dipping. So we had five slices of bread and olive oil, which was better than starving. My gf had a glass of wine and I had a spicy beer. All was okay.

Then the bill came: $30.88. From my previous trip, I knew to expect to pay a lot for a little, so it didn't faze me. But my girlfriend pressed, saying, \"So 30 bucks for a beer, a glass of wine and five bread slices?\" I checked the bill and, sure enough, we had been charged $16 for bread. I was happy with the bread, but felt it was excessive, even by BV standards, to pay $3.20 per slice.  

I brought up the $16 bread with the bartender, who immediately apologized profusely, explaining we had been mistakenly been charged for the cheese and sausage platter. My thought: \"$16 for cheese and sausage?\" She then took back my credit card and fixed the bill, giving us our drinks free and charging us $7.50 for the bread. That brought it down to $1.50 per slice. 

What if I had not noticed or protested the bread charge? It seemed dodgy at best that she wouldn't have noticed such an inflated price before giving us the bill. We spent perhaps 45 minutes there, and our experience began and ended with half-baked customer service."}
{"text":"Visited here with some friends while passing through town. They have an excellent selection of beer - and it seems that thy specialize in Belgian ales (my favorite!). I had a burger, which was delicious. Service was prompt and excellent. Will definitely return next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I love any place that is amenable to the small plate, which this place does. My date and I got to share all of our courses. All of the flavors here were excellent. The primary criticism of this place is that the dishes came out lukewarm. Everything we tasted was excellent but not necessarily hot. The biggest disappointment on that front was receiving lukewarm gougères. Bread products (like soup) should always be piping hot."}
{"text":"Been here twice and had an awesome experience, The muscles were great. Unique place and well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Brasserie V on Monroe Street in Madison, WI
First let's talk about the experience. This is a beautiful bar. It's covered in dark wood paneling, the lighting is low, and it is great for small to medium groups. I wouldn't go with a large group because it gets really packed. Every time I have gone I have also had amazing service! This time our waiter was funny, helpful with the menu and pointed out items he enjoyed, and knowledgable of the specials. I would give this guy 5 stars. He was awesome. 

It took a while to get our food, but this could be because we were there at prime time dinner hour. For food we had the grouper, the V burger, and the mussels. The food was just absolutely delicious! Well... The grouper was ok, but I tasted everything, and I guess other people ordered better than I did. The V Burger is probably one of my favorites in Madison. Then the mussels... There are only a few places in Madison that you can go for good Mussels, and this place is one of them. 

I am docking this place to a 4/5 because the food took forever to come out and because my grouper wasn't that great. Other than that, this place was awesome!"}
{"text":"Brasserie V is a greatest hit. Most consistently delicious and positive dining experience in Madison. We bring all of our out of town guests here. They make Wisconsin and Madison look good - always. I've never had a bad meal or experience here. Don't skip the frites and (obviously) don't skip the beer. Enjoy a more affordable sandwich or fancier entree / small plate options. The salmon BLT is my favorite. I splurged on the steak frites once and it was one of the best steaks I've had. Soups are great - creative and classic. Great for lunch or dinner. Wear your badger hoodie or get your style on. Great for girls/guys night out, game day or a date. I wish they served brunch - I'd be first in line!"}
{"text":"A- OK. 

The most pleasant part of this restaurant was the hostess's greeting at the door. She was very friendly and welcoming. Something I always expect from any restaurant, but it's one of those things that's hard to perfect. 

Let's discuss about the food. The special of the day \"Scallop salads\" was ok. I would not give more than 3/5 for this dish. Although the overall taste was good, the salad was over dressed, and the scallop had little too much salt on the surface. Entree? I ordered braised beef short ribs with balsamic glaze. It sounded tasty, but again, little excessive on salt, and it tastes nothing special. Worse than that, I don't think it matches the price and all the raves they've been getting.

The dessert menu needs to be re-worked. Maybe they can incorporate fresh seasonal fruits or something. As of now, it looks terrible.

Waitress's service was on the slow side, but nonetheless, very pleasant. She could recommend me a decent glass of wine to go with my dish. And oh yeah, the atmosphere was pretty nice. I loved the decor, and while it's not pretentious, it somehow induces the right amount of intimate feeling. So, if their cooking skills and the menu improves, this place could easily be a repeater."}
{"text":"Amazing beer menu, great food, and I just love the atmosphere. The staff is very  attentive as well. I've been at Brasserie V only twice so far but plan to come back again soon. I do wish they would take reservations but at least they have two bars and the window seating to accommodate for a busy night."}
{"text":"Far and beyond the most diverse beer selection in the city. You'll find everything - different countries, styles, GF, ciders...delicious. 

The staff always seem to know their listings, too - never hesitate to ask for a recommendation. 

If you're there for the food, you can't go wrong. The frites and the truffle fries are fabulous, as well as the lime aioli you'll find in some of the sandwiches/burgers. Enjoy it all."}
{"text":"This was a great spot for a drink or two after work. They have lots of beers on tap and 300 bottled beers available. Tuesday's deal is $2 off bottled beer and $4 off 750ml bottled beers. They have a book of beers to choose from. The bar is comfortable to cozy up to or there's tables to socialize at. You take your pick. Lots of food options to tempt your taste buds. I recommend the truffle fries with your beer. Yum! The burgers look to die for too. My opinion... go for a beer... stay for the food."}
{"text":"Excellent french fries with garlic aioli! My dining mates had burgers. The patties were juicy and delicious. The hamburger that came on the sourdough bread (not bun) was harder to handle than than the bun. 

The mushroom sandwich was unremarkable.

But those fries!!! A+."}
{"text":"Ordered a reuben.  Got a burger.  They fetched my sandwich from another table and brought it over.  Reuben was OK--bread was hard/dry.  The homemade chips were thin, a bit greasy, and not plentiful."}
{"text":"What first attracted me to Brasserie V was the ample selection of Belgian beer.  I was pleasantly surprised when I entered to find an adorable, well-lit, almost romantic establishment serving some pretty tasty food.   Our server was very helpful in aiding us through the list of beers -- as my dining companion wasn't really a fan of beer in general. (and we successfully found one that both of us enjoyed)  The bread is served with a seasonal herb butter -- it was green and oh so delicious.  I had the house special mussels and frites.  I was a little disappointed that I had to shell my own mussels, but the work was well worth it.  My dining companion had the steak and frites. She described the steak as tender and enjoyed every morsel of it.  
The restaurant is small, I am not sure if I would ever bring a group of people here.. however it would be a great place for a date or a double date."}
{"text":"Beautiful space with lots of light and two rare New Zealand ciders that were so tasty! Obviously the beers are great as well. Yummy apps and really friendly service!"}
{"text":"Recent visits to Brasserie V have been very meh. Sat at the bar for a quick meal, and on two separate occasions the burger was served cold. Cold. The other food has been consistently good, so the review only drops one star."}
{"text":"What an excellent lunch spot! And I didn't even try their famous beer!  I had the apple, pesto, gruyere on a baguette and it was out of this world! Perfect compliment of flavors. My friend had the turkey, avo, cheddar and she literally said she was in heaven.  Service was excellent, so friendly!!"}
{"text":"Great beer.  Good atmosphere and very good service.  Good food and reasonable pricez.  Only gets 3 stars because I am a tough grader."}
{"text":"We hadn't been here in over a year. Used to come frequently for lunch back when we had time to go out for lunch during the week. We've always thought they had one of Madison's best burgers and fries, and have been really happy with our other selections. So when we were on Monroe St. for some Saturday shopping, we decided to return to an old favorite. Our party had beers and:

1/2 ABLT, 1/2 squash soup
Croque Monsieur 
1/2 turkey, 1/2 potato leek soup

Generally a home run! Potatoes were a hair underdone in the potato leek soup, but not a deal breaker. Sandwiches were awesome. Love the bread and portioning of ingredients. They pay attention to proportions, which on a BLT, is a big deal to me. Tomato was thin sliced, bacon was meaty and avocado was the right thickness. Bread was toasted just right. Not to hard, not too soft.  Soup had good detail, with the garnish.

Service was great and atmosphere was good as ever with the expanded space. Thanks, Brasserie V for keeping it tasty all these years."}
{"text":"Overall the food was delicious, but the service was subpar. 

Truffle fries and duck confeit fritters for appetizers. Both were delicious, including the aoilis that came along with it. 

Burgers were absolutely delicious. Cooked appropriately and well  seasoned. We chose potato salad as a side, which was lackluster and tasted vaguely of a generic grocery store brand. 

Beer selection was fairly large, including taps and bottles. 

Service was subpar overall. The bar was fine but at the table, refills were not completed, water and beer alike. It was maybe only a couple of visits from our waitress, which was at 9 pm on a saturday with a few open tables..so not very busy. That could definitely have some improvement."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. I've been here at least 5 times and I have never been disappointed, which has made it one of my favorite places in Madison. They do an excellent job of creating quality, unique meals with rich, memorable flavors, all at affordable prices. The duck confit they serve is amazing, as is the monkfish, scallops, and duck fat fries. The international beer selection is also a huge draw, as you can try lambic ales and other varieties that are not found in most bars. The restaurant is charming and warm, with large tables. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I feel like I sent my teenager to college.
Like I walked my oldest daughter down the aisle. 
She's all grown up...
...and I'm thrilled I can say, \"I knew her when.\" 

Back when she was a few tables and a neighborhood bar. Back when servers were speedy and bartenders had stellar beer recs. Back when the only thing to stave my hunger was pretty much the best burger in town. Back when frites were fierce and sauces to dip them in were stupendous. 

Here's the thing though, that's still the case even after the expansion! Bring on the burgers, the frites, those incredible mussels swimming in a butter connection I'm afraid to know too much about. Bring on the friendly staff that make you feel like family and Andrea and Matt that always greet me with a smile. Bring on a crazy amount of Belgians in bottles (I'm talking 200 at any given time). And bring on what I think has the coolest atmosphere for grabbing grub with friends on Monroe Street.

Sometimes when a restaurant gets too big for its own good by knocking down walls, polishing up original tile flooring and installing a beautiful wood bar that frames the stunning beer coolers nicely it can flop. But not here. Brasserie V was ready, and I'm not certain how they did it so seamlessly, but the transition to a world with additional seating was smooth. I want to say it has something to do with the folks in black (the ones that work there) that jump, no dive in head first, willing to do whatever it takes to make experiences memorable for folks like me that knew her when."}
{"text":"In short, food was amazing but the service was much  less desired. Our party had a very frustrating experience here. The hostess seated us in the bar section and we had to wait over 45 minutes to place our order. Our waitress neglected us because we were seated in the bar section off to the side and we had to be proactive in getting water for the table and checks. Will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"I dined here for a solo lunch on a Friday. It had been almost 5 years since I last visited, and it did not disappoint! The excellent service and quality of food were just as I remembered. The citrus addition to the aioli served with frites is divine. I also had a bowl of soup which contained kohlrabi (I had never seen my favorite vegetable on a restaurant menu!), turnips, beets and it was perfect- not too salty and very savory and flavorful. I had the Bordeaux blend red wine and it was delicious as well. The waiter was prompt, attentive, but not intrusive; he kept a watchful eye, but let me enjoy this perfect meal in peace. I've decided this is my favorite spot in Madison."}
{"text":"I just discovered that I had not yet reviewed Brasserie V!! Does this count for yelp #newvember?! 

I've been here countless times over the past few years, and I have yet to be even slightly disappointed. The wait used to be super long before they expanded the place, but you could always just grab a beer or glass of wine and hang out until a table was ready. Now there is still typically a wait at peak dinner times, but they have more bar space and more tables so it feels a lot less crowded.

The food is delicious! I've ordered quite a few items on the menu, but I come back to the mussels and frites over and over. They change the two aiolis that come with the frites often, and they seasonally change the broth for the mussels. The frites, as everyone else has mentioned, are amazing and cooked perfectly (double fried!). The burger is great, with beef from a local farm. The duck is delicious, and the cheese plates are awesome. Brasserie V also offers an impressive selection of Belgian beers and French wines. I highly recommend the St Bernardus Abt 12 beer, especially if you're new to Belgian beers.

The service is always friendly and attentive. I recently ate at the bar for the first time and am happy to say the service was equally good.

The food and drinks are a bit pricey, so while it has a casual atmosphere, this is sort of a splurge/date night spot. Come here with a date who you're comfortable enough with to gorge on frites with no shame!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars if only they served liquor. They have an incredible list of beers though. The food is excellent for the price. Moules frites are some of the best in town. Chef Rob takes a lot of pride in assuring consistency. Some of the best sandwiches I've ever had are the Caprese and the Portabella mushroom sandwich. They have an assortment of aioli's that are to die for. Service is always friendly and attentive. Don't be shy to ask for any other aioli's on the menu that day to accompany the frites."}
{"text":"Love this place. My favorite all-time burger anywhere is their V-burger, and they also have the best frites I've had anywhere. I wish they served cocktails but they have so many- as in hundreds- of great beers, I can see why they don't. Nice staff too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Steak, frites, and Brussel sprouts are amaaaazing. This is a great place for a romantic dinner and the beer selection is fabulous. Wait can get pretty long but it's completely worth it."}
{"text":"Im tough on places so I hope this comes across as positive as I really do appreciate this place.

The food Ive had there has been decent. The soups tend to be lacking salt and flavor but are enjoyable. The frites and mussels are very good and the sandwiches are good as well.

Now to the real reason you go here: beer and wine.
They boast an impressive booklet of beer and other beverages. I love new and interesting beers and there is always something that delivers. I would reccomend beer on tap and not bottles. Beer is mostly meant to be drunk fresh and having mostly European beers means that shipping time and transfer means most of these beers are not fresh and have sat around for a while before someone decides to try that Belgian 12 year aged Abby with hints of molasses and leather.

The environment is cozy, warm and jovial and I love this place for work drinks and date nights!
Definitely a place to go and try!"}
{"text":"By way of an update, I went for sliders night; amazingly high-quality beef in those little bundles of joy.  I'm very happy that I can now highly recommend Brasserie V for both dinner and libations."}
{"text":"I throughly enjoy Brasserie V, and I have been an avid customer for at least the last decade! 

To begin with, their cheese board is phenomenal because you can choose 3 ($16) or 5 cheeses ($25) and they come with bread, apples, and honey roasted nuts. The frites here are also amazing, and I really love how they have the classic aioli and a different one as well. The sandwiches are also great and come with a side of your choice. My two go to sandwiches are the Apple Swiss and the mushroom one. 

In addition, they have a wide selection of beers to choose from. From local to international beers, you can always find one that is in your taste buds. If you have any questions about the beers, the staff is very knowledgeable. 

When it comes to the service, it can be slow at times, but they are extremely helpful and friendly! I always feel very taken care of when I stop in. They know the menu very well and can help you with any questions you have. 

There are only two downfalls when I think of Brasserie V. One of them of them is how it may be hard to find parking when going to this restaurant. The other one is how the menu has hardly changed in the last 10 or so years. 

Other than that, Brasserie V is where to get your savory tooth fixed!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here in a large group without reservations and I felt terrible about ambushing them like that. However, the hostess got us all seated in a timely manner. They have a great selection of cider for gluten-sensitive folks like myself. 

We ordered fondue and the server brought me a plate of carrots to dip in the cheese, which was actually pretty good. My friend ordered the frites and we dipped those in the fondue too.

I wasn't too hungry after all of that fondue, but I also got a cup of the most delicious spinach artichoke soup. Seriously awesome. I also got this frisee salad that was kind of hard to eat and not really worth it. Oh well! It was still a great night."}
{"text":"Excellent food and beer selection. We arrived around 3:30 on a Saturday. Late lunch, early dinner. Unfortunately it's too early for the dinner menu and the pork belly sliders are not available either. So that was a bummer but I was really there for the beer, frites and burger. All three were excellent and very tasty. My wife had a really good smoked salmon sandwich with Nueske's bacon and I had the Winter V Burger. Very good flavor I thought. Nice medium rare pink ness. Overall, we arrived at a good time and sat at a really nice cosy table sort of away from everyone. Server was very nice and prompt. Definitely would like to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great beer and great food. The location is awesome for before or after Badger games."}
{"text":"Best frites and aioli in town. And there are always plenty of interesting beers to try.

Get the fondue if you're in a cheese mood, because it is delicious.

This is my favorite place to go when I want kind of fancy food, but I also don't feel like dressing up."}
{"text":"5 stars for the great beer.  Cheese plate and salad was secondary but really good too."}
{"text":"Crazy beer selection! Frites are really good with beers. They had a holiday drink menu and they were really good! Nice place to hangout with friends."}
{"text":"mmmmm those FRITES are soooo good.  Gotta get the frites!  (and next time I think I would ask for a second portion of the aoli)
This was our first stop using the Madison City Tins I got for Xmas (a highly recommended purchase) and the bottle of wine we got was superb. 
I had the Belgian salad with the duck and my partner had the pasta gratin.  She was in love, mine was fine.  I will definitely go back for the frites and look forward to enjoying another entree."}
{"text":"HOMG...Brasserie V ais ALWAYS reliable for a pleasant dining experience (and if you haven't been there in a few years, even better now that they have more dining space).

It's just sooooo good. And not some times.  All the times!

The frites are amazing.  I dream about the cones of frites made the LEGIT way (par fried to cook through, and then at the time of ordering, fry again for crispiness).  And two aiolis! 

The V Burger is made with not just Highland beef, but dry aged local Highland beef.  Whooooa.

It's good.  Really good.  Get the V burger, order a beer from their long menu of Euro alcoholic beverages, and be happy."}
{"text":"Great Belgian/French food! Went for lunch and got the Belgian salad w duck breast and my mom got the mussels traditional style and fries. All the food was cooked just like it should be and so tasty. Lunch portions were generous and well priced. Beer selection great as well. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I don't really have a neighborhood bar, but if I did, it would be Brasserie V.  As much as I enjoy the food (and I do), the main reason to go is the enormous selection of beers from around the world.

First, the menu: My favorite meal includes one of the V Burgers (they usually have two on the menu, and I believe at least one rotates with the season), medium rare, with frites.  We usually put together a cheese board (Pleasant Ridge Reserve, yum) to kick off our meal.  I just noticed that they have Belgian meatballs on the menu - I'm going to have to try those next time.  My vegetarian daughter has no trouble ordering a delectable dinner.  And, unlike so many other Madison establishments, the service at Brasserie V is actually quite good, despite how busy the restaurant can get.

And yet - the reason to go is because there are so, so many outstanding beers.  They specialize in Belgians - but they have so many other styles on tap and in bottles.  A flight of three pours is a good way to sample.  I am particularly drawn to porters and stouts, and Brasserie V does not disappoint.  For kicks, I just now took a look at their current bottle list, and it includes the following stouts: Dark Horse Plead the Fifth Imperial Stout, Evil Twin Bozo Beer (17% ABV!), Central Waters Satin Solitude and Bourbon Barrel Stout, Del Ducato My Blueberry Nightmare (from Italy), four versions of Mikkeler's Beer Geek (Denmark), To Øl Barrel-Aged Pineapple Express (Denmark), Samuel Smith Imperial Stout and Oatmeal Stout (UK), and 17 more.  

See what I mean?

So, by all means, please enjoy stick-to-your-ribs Euro-style pub food at Brasserie.  But recognize that the frites and mussels and cheeses and meaty entrees - as delicious as they are - are the sideshow, and beer is the main event."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Brasserie V by my sister who is quite the fan. She has been raving about their frites and tap beer. Usually, when someone talks so highly about a place it builds the expectation and I'm usually left disappointed. Luckily, this place met all expectations and more!

We came during a late lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. It was busy, but not packed and we were able to find a seat immediately. It's located on Monroe street, so parking may be difficult during peak hours. It's a long and narrow building with an old pub feel. The bar takes up quite a bit of space, as it should. The beers are deserving of a nice bar. 

The service was pleasant and attentive. Food was excellent. I had a Caprese and my sister had a croque monsieur. We shared the frites. Definitely a must order. They came with their house aioili as well as a Greek style aioili. According to my sis, they change up one and in the past have had flavors such as lavender. 

The beer menu can be overwhelming, but unless you're there for something specific I would stick with the taps. Saison Dupont is an excellent choice if you like a Farmhouse Ale. But, you could always ask the waiters, they are pretty good with recommendations. 

All, in all, a great (and interesting) place to eat and try new beers."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service.  From Chicago and Visiting friends at Univ of WI hospital.   We found  restaurant on Yelp.  Amazing menu and unlimited choices for craft beers.  Being from Chicago I was pleasantly surprised at all of the craft beers they had on hand and the creative \"farm fresh\" menu.  Service was outstanding and our server had great  recommendations for food and beer.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, even better beer selection. They have a huge list of Belgian beers to choose from. The food is always on point as well. 

I had their mussels with garlic & shallots for dinner. The mussels were fresh and tender. The broth was delicious and packed full of flavor. Perfect for soaking some bread in."}
{"text":"You're likely to score when you hit up Monroe Street, but this place abuses the privilege. The best offering at Brasserie V is definitely the beer selection: they have about 12 on tap every day plus plenty of bottles. They have quite the selection of wine too.

Food's pretty good, modern American and quite tasty. The caprese sandwich was quite good, as were the truffle frites. 

Perfect for a first date or happy hour, definitely hit it up!"}
{"text":"Steak frites! The dish was amazing. Great wine too. Not the most responsive staff and we waited over an hour and 15 minutes for a table. It was a fun date night with 2 other couples. We ended up spending the whole night there."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection. Haven't been able to find the sculpin by ballast point since I left New York. Had the modules frites which were predictable but good. Wish there had been more broth to dip my frites in. Their aioli selection was really good with a classic garlic and a malt vinegar. The best part of the entree were the frites: thick, salty and hand cut! This is how I love them. Will return soon with my other half."}
{"text":"My husband ordered a monk's cafe flemish sour, unbelievable flavor.  but I went with the chateau magence graves from bordeaux france. Ahi tuna was a good blend and the v burger was excellent. Tuscan soup today was ok taste.  Not too busy at 2:15 pm.  Fun to sit by the window when it's warm."}
{"text":"Yes, please!  

I stopped at Brasserie V as a Yelp recommendation while I was in Madison on business. 

I loved that the bar tender was so knowledgable about the menu and he even let me sample some of their really expensive fancy brew from Denmark!  

The food was great - I had the quiche and salad with a lemon shortcake dessert!  

I would say this would be a good place for a date, but if you have the money - I found that this is also a great stop for lunch (they do have a soup/salad/sandwich option for $8)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a busy Monroe Street Festival Saturday. Since there was a wait for a table, we enjoyed lunch at the bar since we could order from the full menu.  They have a ton of beers on tap. 
We ordered mussels with fries; and a shiitake sandwich on Gluten Free bread. The sandwich came with nicely dressed greens. 
Very very happy with the food. The frites were so yummy with the accompanying two fresh aiolis
Prices were very reasonable and even though it was very busy, it didn't take long for the food.
WILL RETURN for sure."}
{"text":"Go there early to avoid the crowd. 
My husband got their red wine and I got a glass of mead to pair with our food. A Goblet of Bacon... along with other dishes on the menu made my day!"}
{"text":"Brasserie V is for sure a restaurant you should visit.  The Monroe Street neighborhood has always been an eclectic down-to-earth scene, but within the last 5 years its made even better progress at burgeoning into a big city feel.  Brasserie V heightens that aspect with a cool vibe and an incredibly relaxed atmosphere.  

People come here to sip on delightful Belgian beer (of which they have many) and indulge on Belgian food classics.  Mussels, duck sausage, creative burgers and sandwiches, and AH-mazing frites.  Their frites are hands down the best French Fries in town, no contest.  Crispy, juicy, garnished with Parmesan, and accompanied by savory sauces.  DO NOT under any circumstances skip on these frites during your visit.

Since their expansion the wait times have improved and they have two relatively full bars in addition to a window seating area and their normal tables.  The staff is polite and and have always responded well to questions.  It's a great place for a date night or just a spot for when you want to chill out, as we all need to do these days.

They would have received five stars, but they are a bit pricey ($15-30 a plate generally and $6-10 beers), and on my last visit I had the special (Kansas City Steak with Mushrooms and Truffle Spinach) which I was quite disappointed with.  The steak had a lot of fat, was very tough, and they didn't have a Steak Knife.  She brought out a second regular knife and when I asked for a Steak Knife they didn't have one for customers.  That kind of soured my meal since I had to hacksaw my way through the dish.  I've noticed this with specials at other nearby places, so maybe just stick to one of the established plates as its worked in the past for me here.

Relax, Take a load off, and enjoy the V"}
{"text":"Cozy interior. Inviting atmosphere. Reminiscent of a mod wine cellar. 

The frites are excellent. Go for the white truffle and parmesan frites with black pepper and mushroom aiolis. Those were promptly devoured. 

If you're looking for a lighter appetizer option that delivers just as much fresh flavor, try the summer tomatoes with roasted garlic, fresh mozzarella, and balsamic vinaigrette. Yum.


As for entrees, we ordered:
Beef Barley Soup

Steak-frites...12oz flat iron steak, cabernet pan sauce, braised greens

Croque monsieur... nueske's applewood smoked ham, swiss, honey mustard & tomato w. cucumber and red onion

V burger...dry aged highland ground beef topped with beer battered onion straws, muenster cheese, spinach, tomato & aioli 

Avocado blt...on Madison Sourdough bread with pub chips

Grilled duck leg a l'orange...sweet roasted onions, citrus jus, garden to be greens


Every dish was wonderfully flavorful and I'd recommend each one."}
{"text":"Great beer list which never disappoints. The frites are good. I was sad when they got rid of the fried chickpeas off the menu. They have a good variety of vegetarian options. The sandwhiches are good though not overly filling."}
{"text":"I love this place just for the extensive, hard to find Belgian, Dutch, and from everywhere else type of beers.  The food is delicious too."}
{"text":"Unfortunately faced the kitchen this time. It really should be more obscured, there's a lot there that I didn't need to see. And aren't the cooks supposed to be wearing hair covering? TMI."}
{"text":"Great food. Locally sourced. Excellent flavor. Awesome selection of Belgian beer. Friendly attentive staff.

This place gets really busy and crowded for dinner on the weekend."}
{"text":"Unique menu with some very good sandwiches. I like the brunch there, but best for lunch and dinner in my experience. Atmosphere is low-key, music is a good, low volume. Beer selection is excellent if you like pretty much any European beer.Vegetarian selections are solid. Burger is well above average as well. Plates run $8-24 but the value is good. The frites are decadent."}
{"text":"Not one of our favorite places but we thought we'd try it anyway. The mussels and fries were quite good. Mussels were small but perfectly done and quite tasty. A disappointment was the chicken pot pie which was almost tasteless and the crust was doughy. Marie Callender is far better."}
{"text":"The beer selection is amazing! They have specific glassware from the maker for every beer I have had there. The mussels are really good and come with a huge thing of frites. Definitely have to share unless you are starving. The bartenders are really good with selections if you are overwhelmed by the 4-5 page beer list. They have some of the common beers from around town but I find it much more exciting to get a little adventurous. I highly recommend trying one of the two sour beers listed. I had bigger expectations for the goat cheese salad and it almost pushed me to a three star but I realized we didn't go there for a salad we went for the beer, mussels, and deviled eggs! All of which were spot on!"}
{"text":"Great frites and aioli . I eat lunch here weekly since I work nearby. The avocado BLT  is my favorite . They have great soups as well. They do not have hard liquor but they do have a huge assortment of beer and a decent assortment of wine. Hubby loves Belgian beer so he loves this place. Great and friendly service."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I split the moules et frites and burger, and both were amazing.  Seriously one of the better bucket of mussels I've had--certainly in Wisconsin--and the fries were definately  great.  

The beer selection is solid but pricey.  I know everyone goes totally crazy about belgium beers-and i really do love them--but you're basically paying for the import costs.  There are tons of amazing breweries in the states and Wisconsin producing some really interesting belgium-esque styles at a fraction of the price.   So it's hard for me to justify paying $7.50 for a 6-oz. pour of a LaChouffe, when a full pint of Dave's Brew Farm Matacabras--which tastes as good as most belgium quads-- can be had for $3.50 down the street

But we really did enjoy the place and meal.  It just felt like we were back in Washington, D.C. again, where everything was just slightly more expensive than it probably should be."}
{"text":"Brasserie V has an EXCELLENT selection of beers, some of which you can't find in even the largest liquor stores in Madison. Their frites are simply amazing and their meals have also never disappointed me. However, eating here will be anything but cheap and some of the portions have been very small. It has also been very crowded and it can be tough to get service at times. I would suggest Brasserie V for a quick drink and order of frites with friends, that is when this place truly shines."}
