{"text":"Great family owed place. Been a few times and the food is always good, either in the restaurant or for take out. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food was amazing, the service was excellent, and it's beautiful and clean inside. They're still waiting on their liquor license comma but I'm sure that will come through shortly. I intend to go back at least once a week!!!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have eaten at this restaurant. I had the grilled pork vermicelli noodle bowl. It was outstanding.  Great meat/noodles/vege combination.  It's worth the drive, even though Main Street is tore up in Mesa. Five stars!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, one of the better Pho places I have been to in the past. Service was a little slow but overall it was a good experience as the dining room was not very busy. I would probably come back if in the area again."}
{"text":"I've been patiently waiting for this restaurant to open after seeing a sign outside blowing softly  in the wind.  Situated in a quaint strip mall in Mesa, Pho Leo is a hidden gem of a restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised at how tastefully and soothing the indoor space is decorated.   Warm earth tones, ample room between tables, and several large booths along the main wall for those who want to squeeze in together as a group. Also, a bar area for those who prefer to be closer to the liquor.  Service was excellent and the food was packed with flavor and portions were well worth the price! I even took home an order of beef stew with egg noodles for my mother. I want to return and try everything on their menu. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and great service.  We saw the good ratings and tried out and have to agree.  It is a five stars!"}
{"text":"This is a great find in Mesa. Coming from California, we have been looking for some good authentic Vietnamese food! I think we found it! All of the food was great, the place was clean, staff was friendly! My onnnnnly critique would be to leave the soy sauce at the tables and not serve it in teeny dishes. :) also, the Thai Tea was INSANE. Not too sweet, not too thick. Absolutely perfect! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We arrived at around 3pm and a young lady attended us. She was very friendly and helpful. The recommended the Pho Leo Special #1 which is a huge bowl (enough for 2) of lettuce and beans sprouts topped with warm rice noodles topped with 3 grilled shrimp, 2 pork patties, a smattering of sliced grilled pork and a cut-up egg roll (cha gio), which was a terrific sampling of the popular items served over rice noodles. Garnished with mint and cilantro, the cha gio is, for me, the standard bearer of a Vietnamese restaurant. It was delicate and delicious packed full of a tasty pork/veggie mixture, and the wrapper was nice and crunchy. I loved it that the cha gio was served right away, as it was still hot! Lastly, we had the french-style filet mignon with a Vietnamese sauce called Luc Lac, the best tasting sauce ever on filet mignon. You cannot go wrong with this new restaurant, especially as they are having a half-off special for a limited time."}
{"text":"I've ordered rare steak and brisket Pho with large size. Both broth, noddle and side stuffs taste excellent and authentic, I love it! Steak and brisket surprisingly large portion, taste good but when I come again I have to order rare steak in raw, not their fault. And finally, the price is so cheap, the large portion get me really full which originally cost less then 10, and now they are still in promotion add extra 25% off before tax, unbeatable!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pho restaurant. I live in Mesa and would have to drive out to chandler to find some decent pho. The prices are great and you get a lot of bang for your buck! I would definitely recommend this place if you like pho"}
{"text":"This is a brand new restaurant right on Main St in Mesa. Clean and large, good service, nice bar area.   Most of all, I have ordered two different dishes there and both have been great! The food is fresh and flavored perfectly! The vegetables in my dishes were cooked perfectly and so fresh!   I highly recommend this gem!"}
{"text":"Best vermicelli I've had in Phoenix. Great service. Good prices. Fast and filling. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"This is a hidden treasure. The size of a bowl of soup is like for two people. And our appetizer was delicious and authentic."}
{"text":"Very good pho..and had the bowl (bun) with shrimp..fresh ..flaverfull..recommend highly..not a fancy place..but great food.."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait folks. The appetizers were so bomb and the pho was even better!"}
{"text":"Drove a distance because of the reviews. I have to say it was worth it. Ordered the pho and one taste of the broth and I knew I found pho Nirvana. There was enough beef to satiate my hungry state. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"They were the nicest people - food was great and came out fast! We got the Pho Chin and the chicken and noodles. Both were delicious and flavorful!"}
{"text":"Awesome hole in the wall kinda place. The pho was a-maz-ing. The service is a tad slow but worth the wait. Currently they're selling their menu half off since they've only been open a short amount of time. Give these guys a chance! You won't be sorry. :)"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious. Pho-nominal!! I had the Pha Ga (chicken) and Spring Rolls w/pork and shrimp. Everything was on point, the chicken is white meat and the portion of chicken was more then I was expecting so yummy...and the Peanut Sauce super creamy and perfectly balanced for roll dipping.  It's going to be my #1 spot for now on :)"}
{"text":"Pho here is better than most places in the valley,  very good broth.  We also ordered the appetizer combo #1 which include egg rolls,  spring rolls,  and summer rolls all of which are decent. Service is great and friendly. Highly recommend this new Viet pho place. Currently has 50% off everything until the end of April. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really good pho and spring rolls. Their roasted pork spring rolls with peanut sauce are amazing."}
{"text":"This is a new Vietnamese eatery in the area. It was nearly empty when we showed up after 7pm. Customer service was very good. Our food was excellent. The pho broth was seasoned to perfection. The combo fried rice was so good. Looking forward to returning and supporting this local small place. We look forward to coming back and trying more dishes."}
{"text":"Hate to write a bad review here, as many people really like this place. I'd say 4-5 stars for the food, but the service was really bad when I visited. Here's the scoop:  So, when I arrived there was only one other customer who was waiting for their to-go food order.  I was greeted by the server, and told her the order was to-go.  She gave me a menu and disappeared.   After about 10 minutes, I was going to walk out, but someone from the back came out asked if the server had taken my order -- I said no.  This person disappeared for a few more minutes, then returned and took my order since there was still no sign of the server.  This mystery person was not a server, but was super nice and helpful. She took the order, got the food, computed the bill, but when I presented cash she had to find the server for change.  After the transaction was complete, the nice person said goodbye, and wished me \"Happy Easter\" (while the server making change seemed almost angry that she had to do something).  I turned to the nice person that did all the work and put a tip right in front of her, looked her in the eye, and said \"thanks for helping me out\".  Then the most amazing thing happened.. the server (who did NOTHING) reached way across the bar and stole the tip from the person I gave it to!  Wow!  In hindsight, I should have said something, but the action was so crazy, rude, and unexpected that I just walked out amazed at the audacity of the server. I feel sorry for the nice person that has to work around such a person.  I have no plans to return.  :("}
{"text":"Great pho but SLOW service. I was here when it opened and thought the wait was maybe normal. They have been open for months now and I feel that the wait for our food was longer than the first time. The restaurant was not even full and we waited almost 30 minutes for our appetizers. Spring rolls were good but I don't recommend the fried calamari."}
{"text":"Food was very good and service was deer. Maybe due to all the construction, but there was only 1 other table seated while we were there. Seemed clean, service fast."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident. I did a yelp review and saw it had good reviews. I made my way in and the staff was polite friendly and helpful. I used pictures of what others had took on yelp to help decide my meal.  The food was great and hot. Wish i had a bigger stomach to take it all down but took the leftovers togo. Hope to make it back here in the near future."}
{"text":"I grew up in Ca. There are amassing Pho spots everywhere. But, here in Mesa, let  alone AZ as a whole, not so much. This place is GREAT! It's nice to finally find a local spot where I can finally scratch that Pho itch I get a couple times a month. Kudos to the staff. They're fantastic!"}
{"text":"I have only had my orders delivered from Pho Leo, so I cannot comment on table service or the actual restaurant. For delivery, they are stellar. I always order the grilled pork spring rolls with peanut sauce, one Pho Ga (with chicken breast), and one Pho An (with raw steak slices). Everything is packaged separately for delivery so it is very easy to put your meal together at home. The broth is in large to go cups and double wrapped in plastic bags to avoid any mess, pho toppings are portioned in small bags so that we may add them to our soup to our liking, and noodles and protein are packed in a regular to go box. This is my husband and I'd go to when cooking dinner can't happen. We always have our order within 45 minutes!"}
{"text":"Great new place. The best I've had in AZ. Fell in love with Pho as I have traveled to Vietnam several times for work. Been looking for a Pho place for a while, but nothing has stuck. I've had several types of Pho, the spicy beef soup and several flavors of the fried rice. Everything is really good..."}
{"text":"So happy I decided to check this place out and it's also a convenient location! Had the #30 egg rolls & crab puffs & the food was delicious! I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Very delicious. I'm from California (which has the best Asian Restaurants) and just moved to Arizona months ago, and I have been trying to find a good Asian Restaurant... And Pho Leo hit the spot! I would definitely recommend to many people and when my fiancé and I went all the food was 50% off! So we spent only $18 for Pho, stir fry chicken with rice, and chicken wings! All were fantastic!   Only negative were there were little flying bugs that kept bugging us and we were sitting in a booth."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho and other dishes. Thai Tea is SO GOOD! Service is super friendly. They are having some troubles due to light rail construction so please make it a point to patronize these neighborhood businesses so they don't disappear! This is my first time coming here but I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. The food is always very good, authentic, and affordable. The building is clean and the staff are very welcoming and friendly. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some good Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"We are from San Jose and are very particular about our pho. We found Pho Leo on yelp and gave it a try. Their food rivals the best we had in California and is reasonably priced.  We highly recommend it. Just ignore the roadwork out front."}
{"text":"I adore his restaurant, the cooks come out to say hello, and the food is out of this world Fantastic! I Love the Leo Special #1 with the noodles.  I also adore the Pho it is filled with all kinds of tasty treats, also the Spicy Beef soup is to die for!"}
{"text":"Best grilled pork spring roll and pho steak and meat balls ever. Thai tea unsweetened was amazing as well! So much flavor."}
{"text":"Best pho I've found in the valley. It's very fresh and yummy. I love how they package the takeout and how easy it is to order. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall.  I've been meaning to stop by for a long time since I live in the neighborhood but I haven't really been in the pho mood.  Stopped by tonight and it was awesome.  We got the combo fried rice (#37), combo pho (#15), and rare beef pho (#16).  The tendon and meatballs in my combo pho were just prefect and tender. The broth has great flavor, not bland and not overpowering. They have small, regular, and large size pho so you don't have to get more soup than you need and the bowl is packed full of meat and noodles, not just a bunch of broth and tiny amount of ingredients.   Next time I'm getting the French beef stew for sure.   Don't be put off by the construction because of that stupid light rail, you NEED to come here!"}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Pho and spring rolls. Pretty straight forward. Everything tasted great and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Located in a non-descript strip mall, this restaurant is a surprise. The service is friendly and fast and has a charm that made me feel at home. We ordered the dumplings which were fried perfectly. The pho was excellent. They have a covered outside seating that we chose to dine in and the owners were thoughtful enough to bring us a heater. Much recommend."}
{"text":"We've been ordering from Pho Leo for awhile now. Tonite was our 21st or 22nd time.   We've enjoyed the pho, the spring rolls, crab puffs, tamarind chicken wings, pho leo trio, charboiled pork spring rolls, coconut shrimps,  a handful if fried rice, thai teas, and Arnold palmer. All of them were tasty, and enjoyable. We've received warm and friendly service consistently.  The price point is proper.  The mum and pop restauarant isn't fancy... BUT the food and service have been consistently great!"}
{"text":"Great pho and spring rolls!  The Vietnamese iced coffee was a good sugary fix, but I definitely only recommend it to those with a sweet tooth :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My boyfriend and I got some Pho yesterday. I wish I would have taken pics before we ate it all. It looks as amazing as it tasted. They were doing construction out front of this restaurant so it's easy to miss but it's a hidden gem. Anyone looking for some good pho some awesome customer service go here!!!"}
{"text":"The pho here is so flavorful! One of the best pho restaurants I've been to. Don't let the exterior fool you, the food is delicious. Spring rolls were on point as well.   Also, the service is great! Our waitress was very nice and attentive.   I would recommend Pho Leo 100%!"}
{"text":"Very authentic.  Pho was the best I've had.  I ordered coconut shrimp appetizer, and the  trio appetizer, and a small pho with chicken.   The coconut shrimp was not all that, it seemed over cooked.   But the pho more than made up for it.   The trio had two different kind of eggs rolls both were delightful.   I called in the order to pick up on my way home, I had to wait about 10 minutes, no big deal.  I tried to order a beer while I was waiting but the guys on the other aside of the bar didn't understand English.  I guess they just have one super women girl works there that does everything, including all the English talking. She was waiting on the customers in the dining room restaurant and she also helped me, but she wasn't around when I wanted to order the beer while I was waiting, no big deal to me but they could have made more money if they were able to understand coors light."}
{"text":"Best PHO I have had in the valley yet. Been in AZ for 8 years. Tried about 15 places now. Clean restaurant. Friendly service. Food excellent."}
{"text":"What can I say? Pho Leo  is delicious! It's spectacular. I have had a lot of Pho around the valley, and Pho Leo is my new favorite. Pho Leo is authentic in its flavor; i was lucky enough to dine in and taste the Pho Beef brisket, and The Hot & Sour Seafood Bowl Recipes. I shall return to try the rest of these delicious Pho dishes, hungry for more."}
{"text":"I'll admit that this place looked a bit sketchy, especially being in this area. But as a \"hole in the wall\" style restaurant. This place is actually really good. It's really hard for me to eat pho other than my own mother making it, but i have to say this place makes some really good pho and has very caring and exceptional service. This is great because I don't live too far to get some good pho. I compare this place to Pho Thanh in Phoenix, a definitely great place to get great vietnamese food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So good! First time coming here and we loved the food and the staff. The food is the real deal, genuine and delicious!  Going to be my new got to place when I want Pho and some great Vietnamese cuisine.  The owners and staff were so delightful and accommodating.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If your looking for bun bo hue, this is the place to go in AZ. Also great and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place for Pho Thai and found this on yelp. Ordered the Pho Thai, Spring Rolls and a strawberry banana shake. The food is good but the service is lacking. Has to ask 2x for drinks to be refilled and also request our check. Very quiet place, not many customers. The food is good just not sure how long they will be around.  They are currently providing a 50% discount on all food items. I asked if this was a Friday special  the response was no we are doing this for the next 2weeks. Thought it was a little weird? May go back just for the value!"}
{"text":"The 5 star review is for the food all the way!!!  They have a casual atmosphere and can get very busy.  Don't fret about the time it takes for the food because it comes out hot and tasty!  We come here about once a month since they opened."}
{"text":"Went here today after seeing fellow Yelper reviews and they were spot on. Apparently a server called out sick so the service was excruciatingly slow, but when we did get service the chicken wings  were excellent. I also had the spicy beef soup which was a huge bowl of soup. Had to get the short noodle version of the soup which wasn't a problem for me.  We also had Thai Tea  which also was excellent. The special of 50% off was still going on when we went there. Finally we had the combo meat chicken seafood noodle plate which was also delicious. I would come back with the 50% offer but not sure if I would come back if I had to pay full price due to service."}
{"text":"My roommates and I love this place. However my \"love\" is somehow sarcastic. It is true that the prices here are cheap. However, the soup is very salty. Asians don't eat that level of saltiness because we're heathy. I often order to-go. Because with to-go, if I buy two bowls of Pho, I can get 4 bowls out of it with extra noodles and water to add to the soup, making it less salty.  My roommates, who aren't Asians, think this level of savory is the right level. I haven't been back for a few months already so I don't know how the savory changes. Nonetheless, because it is cheap. I'm giving it 5 stars. I can't say anything about the customer service as I always ordered to-go."}
{"text":"As others have said, the service was really slow - even though our party of 6 were (almost) the only one's in there - but the food was outstanding. Server was very kind. Spring rolls were fresh, I wasn't a huge fan of the peanut sauce they served with it as I've had better at other places but it was adequate.  I had samples of everything that was ordered: Fried Rice, Stir Fried Noodles and Pad Thai - all were very good.  However, I ordered the Pho with meatball which I don't think I would order again - the meatball was VERY chewy (rubbery) and the broth had a hint of flavoring that I couldn't quite get into - the tamarind maybe?  I'll be back as the overall experience was good."}
{"text":"I eat Vietnamese food at least once a week and have tried most places in the Phoenix area. I'm pretty picky about my Pho.   So far This review is only based on ordering  the egg rolls and Pho Tai.   The food was worth a 5 star rating. Great broth, super fresh ingredients and a ton of meat.   I had to reduce my rating by 1 star because the service was very slow given we were the only table eating and it was lunchtime.   I will certainly be back for the Pho and look forward to trying their vermicelli pork dishes."}
{"text":"We anxiously awaited this place to open. Today we passed by and saw the open sign.  Yay! We stopped in for dinner. Couldn't believe it, when we walked in all items were 50% off. We loved our meals and requested to pay full price.   Best coconut shrimp I have had.  Go try this place! Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I came here alone for a weekday lunch because I was craving pho. The restaurant was very spacious and clean, but empty considering the time of day and major construction on Main street. The man who took my order was very kind and attentive. I'm all about the noodles and broth and ordered the veggie pho, which was basically chuck full of veggies. I'm excited to come back with my husband and get a simple bowl of pho!"}
{"text":"I get the rare beef Pho any time of the year and it's really good. I had a semi-bad experience once but that was it. I'll chalk it up as a bad day.  The girl steeps the Thai tea as it's ordered and I just love that. Doesn't come from a big premade jug of randomness. I imagine come winter this place will be packed. Spring rolls and peanut sauce are a good inexpensive appetizer too."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the service. The Pho was excellent, the baby back ribs had an awesome sauce, the portions are generous. Defiantly going back again"}
{"text":"We had the oxtail pho special and it was phenomenal.  You must help keep this nice local business in business!  We will be back"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for some Vietnamese soup or Pho. We wanted take out, when we saw how highly rated Pho Leo is and decided to give it a try! Great move on our part!  Pho Leo is very very good!  We ordered fried rice with chicken Pho and crab puffs. It's a great meal!  The way they prepared it was very easy for us to assemble fresh at home. We will be back! The owners were so nice and really prepared a nice meal for us. Thank you so very much!"}
{"text":"Service is slow. Pho was medicore not a lot of flavor but they do give alot of meat which is a plus. Egg rolls were tasty."}
{"text":"Good Pho, not greasy.  Dark beef broth where the beef is the center of attention.  Accented meats of brisket and meatballs with exotic flavors of grilled onions and daikon."}
{"text":"This is the closest Pho place to our house so we had to stop by and give it a try and we are extremely glad that we did. We ordered the Pho Leo Trio which came with spring rolls, egg rolls and coconut shrimp. Everything tastes so fresh and the shrimp looked like it had actual coconut flakes, no imitation here. Another appetizer ordered were the tamarind wings, good flavor but I expected more heat. Now to the Pho, wow. The Pho was very flavorful and the meat was delicious. To me Pho comes down to the broth and this place does it right. The only reason for my 4 stars was because it was a little warm in there and the bathrooms were not up to par. Food 5 stars though"}
{"text":"Nice to have a new Vietnamese restaurant in the area!  Great meal.  Had the wings appetizer and Combo rice plate with grilled pork, shrimp, sausage meat, & egg roll.  Very fresh.  Best of all she said everything is 50% off.....everyday?"}
{"text":"I wanted pho so bad and this fulfilled my graving!! Adding grub hub to the mix and I'm a customer for life!!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here on a Thursday night at 8:30pm (they close at 9). The server was extremely friendly and nice, we were seated right away and he brought us our drinks first and then came back to take our order (he took his time and was very patient with us). We ordered pho and shrimp rolls.   I had the pho with steak and tripe. When it came out, you can tell that they really do take their time with the broth. It was sooo good! The shrimp rolls were alright but I was glad we tried their pho. They also have daily specials so come check this place out! The price isn't bad either for the portion they give you! I will definitely be back! I want to try the oxtail next time(:"}
{"text":"I finally remembered that this place was open, as I live right down the street, and I am SO glad I did. It was my first time. I went in during lunch and ordered my food to go. I ordered the regular size pho with brisket and steak and an order of the shrimp and pork spring rolls. I haven't had great pho since I lived in Virginia. The broth was delicious, meat tender, and the peanut sauce for the spring rolls was so good!! I'm glad I didn't get the large because I have a full portion left over that I'm very much looking forward to eating later. If you love pho and are looking for a new place, I HIGHLY recommend this place!!! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Located in the Gilbert / Mesa area. Construction on the street is still ongoing.  Big parking lot, plenty of space for parking. Outside looks more like a hole in the wall. But the inside is super spacious and looks like it used to be a bar and grill restaurant.  Clean environment with dim lighting. Maybe three to four workers for the whole place.  When you walk in, make sure that they see you are in so they can come and assist you. Otherwise if they are in the back, they won't see you.  Food I got the spring roll and pho Tai Spring roll is $3.95 Pho was $9.75 for large  Plentiful amount of noodle. They are not Cutting back with it in the large bowl. I like the thin sliced beef that they have over here. The beef is actually a pretty good quality. The thin sliced makes it even better, as opposed to other places that has the thick and lower quality beef that gets chewy overtime in the broth.  The broth self is also decent, lots of red onions that bring out the sweetness to it. Again, you don't get the medicine bag broth over here. At least it doesn't taste like it. The broth hits the spot on a cold day and also especially when you are sick.  Comes with the regular side of bean sprout, jalapeno, and lime.  Overall decent pho for the right reasonable price.  As for the spring roll, it's about average to other places. Nothing spectacular. Comes with two pieces cut into four bites with a side of the peanut sauce. Peanut sauce was done right. Inside the spring roll has the shrimp pork lettuce cilantro and maybe mint.  Service was pretty quick after they see that you are a new customer. The waitress was really friendly and attentive.  Restroom was clean as well. They do have a shower curtain that separates the urinal from the toilet. Interesting but whatever works.  This place will probably be my go-to pho place for now. As it's really close to Gilbert.  Check it out"}
{"text":"Absolutely divine. I just moved here from MN and we have excellent pho since there are so many transplants from Vietnam there. This is just as good as anything else I've had; taste of home. The fresh spring rolls and beef pho were out of this world, excellent prices too!"}
{"text":"We are so excited to have found this gem of a restaurant.  We came in for the Pho and were very happy with our selections.  We also love the Vegetable Delight and look forward to trying more menu selections.  If you want fast food and quick service, this might not be the place for you.  If you want quality, delicious food prepared and served by people who obviously care, please check out Pho Leo.  We have become regulars since our first visit a couple weeks ago."}
{"text":"As per other reviews service is a bit slow.  Especially with drinks, however the staff are very courteous and the food was outstanding.  The crab puffs especially were great."}
{"text":"My new favorite pho place. Much closer to me, cheaper, and HUGE portions then other pho restaurants! I had so much leftovers, I took it for my work lunch the next day. Such a great hole in the wall find  Customer service was awesome and we didn't eait too long. Food was delicious. I crave to come here every other day lol"}
{"text":"Being from California, our standards are pretty high for good traditional delicious Vietnamese cuisine. We've tried many places and some were better than others but nothing truly blew us away until Pho Leo!!!! Pho Leo is fantastic. The staff is incredible, very helpful and kind. The restaurant is spotless and spacious. The food is to die for! Finally I have a new go to pho place in Arizona! I'd give more than 5 stars if it would let me :) we will be back for sure!!!!!!!  We had the P19 pho, pork eggroll vermicelli bowl, crab cream cheese wontons. And of course we didn't leave without our traditional Vietnamese iced coffee!!!? 10/10!"}
{"text":"The owner was more focused on his computer than the guests. Took 10 minutes to put in a drink order and another 15 just to get our drinks which we had to flag them down to get. Don't go on a busy night unless you're prepared to be patient. Still waiting for our food 45 minutes after our arrival. Left before dinner arrived we were so frustrated."}
{"text":"We've ordered take out from here a couple of times. Great Pho!  Owners: Please think about replacing the styrofoam takeout containers with more environmentally friendly containers. I for one would pay a little more to save the planet. :)"}
{"text":"Awesome pho, had the oxtail, and it was lovely. We had the grilled pork roll appetiser and it was very tasty as well."}
{"text":"Such good food! You should try it all!! Great Pho, bun, chá, com, and bo luc lac. Delicious Dumplings  and more"}
{"text":"My visit here was my first time trying Pho.  The restaurant was clean and the staff very friendly.  My wife, son, and I each had a regular bowl of Pho.  The portion was huge!  The broth was wonderful, and the veggies crisp.  We had some appetizers which were very tasty.  I would say they were the best eggrolls I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place opened up near my work and it is incredible. I try to eat mostly vegetables and they have great options. Vegetable pho in veggie broth. Veggie stir fry. Veggie curry is amazing. Just the right amount of spice. Lee is fantastic and always gives great suggestions. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food at Pho Leo is 'pho'nomenal. We ordered egg rolls and spring rolls. The egg rolls are the best egg rolls I've had since moving to the mainland. It reminded me of how the Vietnamese restaurants make it back home in Guam. For my main course, I ordered pho ga. The broth and the chicken was delicious. The service was also 'pho'nomenal."}
{"text":"This place is off the hook! Being from Washington state with a pho place on every corner, I got spoiled. Pho here can be hard to find and great Pho even harder. Stumbled upon this place today on my way from AJ to K&K Pepper Springs next to the Hambone (best salsa ever by the way). Today they're having a grand opening so my  was only $4.30 with tax. If I had anything bad to say, service was a tad slow, I told my server she needed a helper, and she said someone called out today. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Best pho I've ever had. They actually cook the broth for 10-12 hours and you can taste the difference. Portion is large, they give a 25% discount on the bill because they just opened. Service was a bit slow but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Great Place!  Not hard to get to with the construction so give them a try.  The Pho was flavorful and the small is anything  but!  The noodle bowl was possibly the best I've had and its my go to dish when my hubby needs a pho fix !  It was piled high with meat and shrimp and the sauce had lots if flavor.  Loved the marinated carrots.  Place was clean and service friendly. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Pho Leo for dinner a couple months ago because we got a money mailer coupon. We are so glad that we did! The servers were very helpful in answering our questions and even brought us a couple different sauces to try with our food. The food came out nice and quick and was steaming hot when we got it. We are definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and stopped by for lunch.   Pretty awesome food.  Our group had oxtail pho, bun bo hue, and short rib special.  Everybody enjoyed the food.  To top it off, the staff and owners were very accommodating, attentive, and friendly.  Our group is pretty picky and have eaten a lot of Vietnamese food, so that's a huge compliment."}
{"text":"Great place although a bit slow. Can't beat the price of 50% almost everything! Will come here more often."}
{"text":"Really great food, good vegetarian options. Thai iced tea was a bit too sweet for me, it a good counterpoint to my big plate of spicy stir fried noodles :)"}
{"text":"This place is very good! I got takeout and they provided everything I needed in the bag! I got the pho ga and it was delicious. Overall this place is amazing and I'm surprised there were only a few people inside when I went on a cold Saturday night. The dinning room is spacious and the only drawback is the construction that's going on for the light rail. Don't let that stop you from going though!"}
{"text":"They have good charbroiled pork spring rolls and the atmosphere is nice.  But the bun bo hue is a little disappointed to me because its flavor is not tasty as I expected and I'm sorry to say but the broth a little bland. I was also a little sad because I didn't get my veggies with my soup. But I want to try more food from the menu and I hope I will have a better experience here."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for pho. the location is a little low-key but the service and food was excellent I will definitely be returning. I hope when the construction for the light rail is done more people will go"}
{"text":"Always on the look out for good Pho... Pho Leo was outstanding, great pho and 49% off too. Alas not 50% but 49% is good enough... We ordered #13 appetizer, two #14's (1 large and 1 regular pho) and #28 Leo Special, with and over easy egg. I'm gonna request it placed on top of my rice next time. We came in during their easy opening (thus the 49% off). Well worth it. I'm glad we found this place..."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get pho in the valley, so delicious and the broth is amazing. The meat is good quality and the appetizers are delicious. Great price for such quantity and quality."}
{"text":"My first time. What a deal. Full vermicelli bowl with shrimp and BBQ pork in authentic Thai manner. Delicious. Service was prompt and very kind. Don't let decor turn you away OR get it to go. Yummy."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a whim. We have always loved pho. We have a few favorite spots in Phoenix metro and we are totally adding this place to it. My husband had the combination pho and the  smell of the broth was so intoxicating I had to try it. The flavor was so robust and loaded with traditional flavors that we love. I had the fried tofu and shrimp spring rolls  that were also really nice. And they make their meatballs in house. If you are a pho enthusiast come check this place out."}
{"text":"I came here with my dad and sister and everything we tried was delicious! We ordered the pho, beef stew and vermicelli bowl and ended up sharing everything. Our server was super nice and friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pho Leo serves up some delicious pho! The location is in an older strip mall next to a pawn shop and is a huge space.   The menu has a good variety of noodle soup, rice dishes and spring rolls. I also liked how they had daily specials printed on the front (Today's special was oxtail pho). I deliberated between a vegetable pho or bun bo hue. Veggies or beef? My meaty tendencies won out and I went with the bun bo hue.   Our meals came out in a short amount of time. My bowl looked amazing! It was filled with a lot of brisket beef, tendon and flank steak and had copious amounts of green onion and thinly sliced red onion. The soup was hearty and full flavored. Even the tendon had a lot of infused beef flavor in it. The broth was very spicy too. My nose started running and I was nearing tears trying to drink all the broth. Hurts so good!  Service was friendly and water was filled as needed. It did take some time for our server to come over and process our credit cards once he delivered our check though. I had also requested my soup as a regular size but I actually got a large size and didn't realize it until I was already a good portion into my meal.  There was so much on the menu I still want to try so I'll be back!  P.S. Right now the roads in this area on Main St are under a lot of construction so drive with caution!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and was pleasantly surprised! Great summer rolls and wonderful pho!"}
{"text":"Seriously, if you like good Vietnamese food, good service, cleanliness and food of high quality...then look no further. The food, service and everything about this place is great. On my first visit I ordered the Pho Leo Trio, Pork/shrimps Spring Rolls and Pho Ga. The chicken (Ga) quality and taste was excellent. The herbs and sprouts were super fresh. My boyfriend liked the Pho, he had never had it before so wasn't too sure what to expect but he liked the quality ingredients and taste :) The trio is excellent, the coconut shrimps are so freaking good. On my second time coming here, as in today, I ordered only regular spring rolls. These are literally some of the BEST I have ever had. Tightly wrapped, fresh as heck, with the cilantro and fresh mint in them and not just a noodle filler mess, the pork is BBQ and not that boiled junk, shrimps are large and spread across the entire roll. Light on the noodles which is great!!! Excellent. I will return. Highly recommended for dine in or take out as this establishment isn't weird and small inside like most . Its a nice place, not cloth napkin, glass water goblin kind of place but an amazing super clean restaurant with a full bar  that deserves well deserved recognition. Awesome."}
{"text":"I ordered the pho ga and shrimp spring rolls. The food was alright it taste like bar pho, the service was slow but staff is nice"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you folks! The food here is delicious. Ok do for the breakdown....  Decore: meh.. (most Asian restaurants though fall into this category) I go for the food, not ambiance  Service: Excellent  Food: tasty! I actually have not had the pho. Every time I come I always end up with the Bun bo hue soup. The spicy ness of the soup is perfect, so flavorful and the amount of protein seems endless! I have also had the spring rolls, good and the veggies are fresh.   Someday I will move past the Bun bo hue and try the pho, which I assume will be equally as tasty. Give this place a go!"}
{"text":"Very good!! A little out of the way for us but, I go again!! Pho, spring rolls, & fried rice were delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is legit.  I've been to high end pho places (golden deli in the 626) and this restaurant compares nicely.  Very welcoming staff and food was on point.  I ordered the pho with brisket and had 12-14 pieces in my bowl.  Egg rolls were crispy, fresh, and filled throughout.  There's a little construction outside the restaurant but was well worth going through it."}
{"text":"Great tasting food. Some of the best pho in town. Would definitely come back. The staff was also very warm and friendly!!"}
{"text":"Okay. I've been a full on pho snob since the first day I've had it. I've tried different places but always went back to my normal place, pho tahnh in central Phoenix. I've said that to say this; pho leo is now my go to place for pho. It's easy to miss amidst all the construction on main, but don't pass this cute and cozy place. The staff is friendly, attentive prompt and welcoming. Thai tea is the perfect amount of sweet and creamy. I also had the coconut shrimp, which tasted a bit on the oily side....you know that fryer taste. But still, great. Next I ordered the pho with \"tender well done brisket\". Holy hell. It was tender. And it was delicious. I'm almost positive the noodles are homemade but I'm no expert, I'm just picky. The broth. Ohh, the broth. Phenomenal. Out of this world. The right amount of savory, salty, and ever so comforting. All in all, my bill was $19.xx  fairly priced for what you get. Just go to pho Leo. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pho restaurants in the east valley.   For starters, I always get the pho Leo trio as an appetizer and share it with my boyfriend. It comes with 2 coconuts shrimps, 2 spring rolls, and 2 egg rolls. One of the best coconut shrimps I've ever had!  I also get the Leo special #1. Which is a bowl of vermicelli noodles with charbroiled pork, grilled pork, grilled shrimp, and egg rolls. Comes with peanuts too. It adds a wonderful taste. The pork is cooked well and the egg rolls are crispy.   Note: they also have a bar. And the Thai tea comes with whip cream. It is delicious."}
{"text":"I had dinner here yesterday & this was actually my second time eating pho here. My boyfriend is a regular at another pho restaurant so I wanted him to try this place & after we left he said how Pho Leo made the best soup he's tried at any place in Arizona. Not only that but I'm kept coming back because of the discounts & the wonderful service. We were greeted with enthusiasm & given fabulous recommendations on all the menu options. I will be back again sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Love eating at this place. The food is consistently great and the people who work here are always so nice and welcoming. One of my favorite spots in AZ"}
{"text":"Pho was VERY good, herbs were fresh and tasty. Egg rolls had a great pork filling with vegetables. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I updated my last review and it appears, the entire thing disappeared. I love this restaurant. They have not just excellent Pho, but vegetable Pho which I always have a problem finding at other places. The curry was a little too spicey for me the first time around, but I went back for it and this time remembered to ask them to make it mild. Sooooooo good! I can't stop eating it. Yep, I really love having a good restaurant in walking distance to my house."}
{"text":"Delicious vermicelli and sooo flavorful. Make sure you don't miss it as there is a lot of construction in front. There was so much food, I had extra for tomorrow's lunch! The owner was so nice and welcoming. Try the Leo Special #1 when you stop by."}
{"text":"My husband brought me home some chicken pho because I wasn't feeling very well and oh my it was delicious! Not to mention, I was craving more chicken Pho the next day and when I called to place an order to pick it up, I realized my husband took my vehicle to take our oldest daughter out for a father/daughter date to the movies. (I had three little ones with me and they wouldn't fit in his company van.) So I called and told them I'd have to cancel the order. But.....one of the employees said they would deliver the food to me since I wasn't feeling well. How amazing!!! I recommend this place to anyone! Not only is the food amazing, the people who work there have big hearts for their customers! Thank you Pho Leo!"}
{"text":"Living in the East Valley, it's hard to make the trip out to Pho Thanh whenever you're craving Pho, but Pho Leo might be the best Pho out in the East Valley!   The restaurant can be easy to miss with all the construction going on on Main Street right now, but once you're in there, the atmosphere is very mellow. The lights are dim, there is plenty of space in this restaurant, hard to tell from the outside.   The food here was great! We ordered the #15 which was pho with meatball, tripe, tendon, rare brisket. It was delicious, they definitely are not skimpy on the meat by the way. We also ordered an appetizer, we got the tamarind wings which were delicious!"}
{"text":"Yeah the the French style beef stew with French bread is freaking amazing!! Aka 5 star"}
{"text":"I travel the Valley all the time for business and I specifically look for Pho.  I ran across as this place and was very impressed.  Quality was good, portions were huge, selection was great.  They even explain how Pho is made and the work that goes into it.  Very impressive and as soon as the State gets done screwing up Main St, it will be easer to get to but they are well worth the trip."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this place and I am so happy he did. The outside threw me off, it doesn't look great on the outside but it's awesome on the inside where it matters. I have had the oxtail pho and the bun bo hue and were both great flavor. The bun bo hue is definitely spicier than most would like it.  I think the spice is perfect, but that of course is a personal preference. The thing that gets me is there is more meat than other places I go to and that will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"This place might not look like much on the outside, but they have the most delicious pho, which is all that really matters to me! The interior is well-decorated, clean, and well-lit. We ordered takeout, and it was ready in about ten minutes. All the toppings were packaged separately, so we were able to assemble everything at home while it was still nice and fresh.   The broth had the most fragrant smell and was absolutely delicious. I ordered the beef, and my husband ordered the shrimp. We each had enough for two huge bowls with just the regular-sized portion. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am picky when it comes to pho. I have ordered take out there twice and really enjoyed the food each time! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I came here with my dad on afternoon in search for some good pho in Mesa. Unfortunately, the reviews led me wrong. We walked in though the doors around 12pm and we felt the same muggy heat inside as it was outside during the hot summer months. We sat at the bar and I noticed dirty dishes just stacked up by the cash register. That and the 85 degree room should have been immediate red flags. I was hoping that this pho would be out of this world.... unfortunately that fell flat too. The pho came out warm and not piping hot. The meat was chewy and I was scared to eat any more of it.  First and last time I will be coming here."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and have only one complaint, very slow service.  I order to go and give it a good 45 minutes before I pick it up.  I have tried the egg rolls-good, the spicy beef noodle soup-full of flavor very good, the French style beef stew- also very flavor full, and my favorite is the lemon grass chicken-excellent.  I'm not an expert in Vietnamese food but everything I've tried at this restaurant is aromantic and full of flavor I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I honestly, overall, think the food is good. I had pho gâ, which is chicken pho, and it was great, I honestly loved it. The cook himself brought it out to us, which I thought was a nice touch. However, I was really bothered by the fact that after taking our initial order, the waitress never showed up again, and we had to go up to the counter to pay the check, and even then, nobody was there and it took a while for her to finally come back and cash us out. It was a frustrating experience, overall!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait folks. We stopped by after 8pm on a Sat. and immediately became entranced by the scents wafting around the restaurant.   We understood that the service may be a bit slow from some past reviews but we were patient, hungry but patient.  Our server was a sweet gentleman who was very excited to seat us.   I ordered the Pho #16, which was a lean steak, and my lady ordered the Pho #17 with brisket.   When our food came we practically jumped into the bowls.   The broth was so perfectly flavored, we added the bean sprouts, basil leaves, and lime, as well as some sriracha for a bit of heat.   It didn't take long to get to the bottom of our huge bowls, the servings were outstanding.   Check this place out, bring you appetite but also bring your manners, I'd hate to see a great place like this filled with rude impatient customers that do not appreciate the energy and dedication that each dish has represented."}
{"text":"Don't let the place fool you on appearance, food was very good and prices are not high. Definitely worth checking out, and grabbing a bite. Very friendly service"}
{"text":"I love this place! I went for the first time tonight and i had great service and the food tasted amazing. We will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Cutting to the chase.  This is hands down my new favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the valley.  Our first order was take out on a Saturday evening.  Was ready on time in 20 minutes.  I had a large seafood pho, wife had a BBQ pork with rice combo and we shared the charbroiled pork spring rolls.  Literally, without exaggeration it was all FANTASTIC.  The pho  broth was exceptional, best I've had. My calamari were a bit chewy at first but after marinating a few minutes this was gone. Wife wouldn't stop talking about her dish and the spring rolls as well and I agreed 100%.  Love a fresh spring rolls, they did not disappoint.  The icing on the cake? Getting the bill and being surprised by a 50% off promotion for the opening!  Even at regular price, the amount and quality of food is more than worth it.  Will be back without a doubt.  As word spreads on this one, business should be booming."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place and it's awesome. Great spring rolls and Hreat Shrimp Pho, you gotta come here !!!"}
{"text":"Very large dining room, can hold large groups with no problems, also very clean. We started with coconut shrimp on recommendation of party exiting while we were entering: 3 very large fresh shrimp per order, really mouth watering good. JT had Beef Pho, meat and veg very good but the broth lacked flavor. I had Leo special #2, a lot of meat, more shrimp, sticky rice and salad. We were stuffed. All items were half off, so we ate like kings and queens for $13.00."}
{"text":"Second time trying this place and amazing again. First time we ate in. Love the releax atmosphere and friendly service. The outside patio looks great. It's a bit far for us to eat often. But it's definitely worth stopping in when we are in the area. Anyone that loves Pho will love this place!!!"}
