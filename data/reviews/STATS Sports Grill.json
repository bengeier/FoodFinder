{"text":"The venue itself is nice, maybe too well lit. Only real complaint is majority of tables are hi-tops. The food is creative, but sub-par.   Definitely will return for pubs and to take in a game!"}
{"text":"Great chorizo breakfast tacos. And the seating outside by the fire is perfect on a late October day. The grapefruit juice is not freshly squeezed though."}
{"text":"This bar/restaurant is one of the best in town. I didn't know there was a restaurant inside the hotel, but it is a hidden gem. Beside the food being outstanding and the bar having a great selection and fair prices for drinks, the staff is amazing. Everyone is very attentive and accomodating. The bartenders Niki, Eva and Kim are great workers, always make me feel welcomed and have great customer service towards a full bar. I feel well taken care of here and I will definitly be back."}
{"text":"Stats Sports Grill, located at the Sheraton Mesa Hotel, free curbside parking, big screen TV's everywhere, take in a Cubs game or your favorite team.   Attention all Cubs fan base, look for the new special menu coming out, only available during the Cubs game on TV!  Come try the new menu that was rolled out yesterday, many great choices to choose from, hope to see you there!  Go Cubs!"}
{"text":"Adjacent to the Riverview Sports Complex, this is one of our favorite after-game stops. The kids enjoy the food , drinks and dessert offerings while the adults can partake in a nicer ambiance, TVs for games, great food selection and an impressive bar menu.   I discovered my beloved Papago Brewery's Orange Blossom here so I may be a little biased as they made this perfect match! In actuality, I was also impressed with the burgers and dinner items. Service was attentive and a manager came by to check on our table. For a hotel restaurant, they exceeded my expectations!  I may amend my review as we tend to visit after local games, but so far have always been very pleased."}
{"text":"The food is ok but the service is terrible.  Would not wait on us on an off game night.  They ran out of Bud Light two nights we were at the hotel.  Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"The guy bartenders here are awesome but something is wrong with the girls.  They never smile. They are slow and always look stressed out.  The worst is the skinny blond girl with the pointy nose.  The absolute worst bartender.  Could it hurt you to smile?"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a Cubs game, pretty typical upscale hotel sports bar, service was excellent, atmosphere was excellent, Prices were very fair, $2 cans of Old Style, Had a few appetizers as snacks  and they were tasty. It was pretty darn crowded so they were having some difficulty keeping  the beer cold but they replaced any that were warm. Restrooms are sort of a hike. I will have to stop back in when there isn't a game next door. Four Stars."}
{"text":"We sat poolside on a Sunday morning when there were a total of 25 people in the entire restaurant, 45 minutes after we ordered food arrived.... my wife's Huevos Rancheros was two deep fried corn tortillas some pinto beans and a pile of scrambled eggs- $11, none of the food looked like it was cooked by a trained chef. The Loco Moco I ordered was just gross. The kitchen and the service here needs tons of work, probably won't go back which is sad because it seems like a nice place."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised! We all enjoyed our food. Two boys, two adults all very happy with portions, taste and presentation. My grandson loved his wings with very generous portions of carrots and celery. The club sandwich was enormous and stuffed with meat. Loved their nachos made with fried potatoes. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Very nice sports bars/restaurant.  Friendly staff and the food is pretty good . I was done working early that day so I had the rest of the day to relax. I ordered a chicken salad and it was delicious!  Later in the evening the place got more busy but the staff was still very attentive to all the customers.  I will definitely return again."}
{"text":"This is a great place to watch games and have a few drinks with friends!!"}
{"text":"The chorizo and potato nachos were really good! I would come here again just for happy hour."}
{"text":"Nothing to brag about. We sat outside before a Cubs game at Sloan Park. Only one blas√© waitress. We had yummy pineapple coconut drinks while our husbands had a $3 Schlitz and a Bud light. We shared average nachos and our friends had an average philly. Fries were crispy and warm.  Will we come back? Perhaps before a game after watching practice. Ambiance was pleasant."}
{"text":"Arrived at Stats, and our server was awesome.  We sat out by the hotel pool so the ambience was great.  It looks like you could easily bring a large group here. Our drinks were pretty good.  Then, we ordered nachos.  Our server asked \"chicken or steak?\"  I said oh no, NO MEAT.  The order arrived, with beef chili on it.  We apologized for not seeing that on the menu (although I do think saying \"no meat\" should have at least promoted a question) and sent back the nachos.  Apparently the staff here weren't impressed because all we got back were chips with that orange cheese you get at gas stations.  Nothing but chips and orange cheese.  For $8."}
{"text":"The bartenders were very friendly and seemed to be overwhelmed but did let that get them down. The food menu was kind of disappointing as it had a very limited selection.  We ordered the house made chips and guacamole and it was very bland. Several people ordered the burger which looked delicious. The best part about the restaurant is the convenience of being located just inside the hotel and near the pool."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, so needless to say I'm not a fan of hotel restaurants.....EVER.....but this bar and grill is a real gem. The people are friendly, the bar is cool, but most importantly, the food is great. I just about died from happiness when I saw their beer specials...and though I don't know any of the beers in Arizona, they were all high quality.   Great appetizers....excellent guacamole!!  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Wait for someone to pay attention to this table. Then wait for drinks and a menu. Then wait a long time for our food. Not even close to what was ordered. Now wait even more...  This bar and grill has high-end finishes but the service is low-end. They're going to have a hard time filling these seats even during spring training."}
{"text":"Great experience during our stay. We had friendly staff, the rooms ans hotel wereclean and the food was very good at the Stats Grill  We had dinner and breakfast there during our stay both were fantastic. Great place for sure and the kids loved the pool area."}
{"text":"My family went here while on a trip and it was subpar at best.  I had a steak which had a lot of fat and was cooked well done...not what I had ordered.  The waitstaff has to get silverware after our food came, also basics like salt.  Our check also took forever to arrive.  Overall, I would not come here again.  Overpriced for the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"I want to love STATS.  I really do.  It's close to where I live, in a beautiful hotel, and has so much potential.  I just can't love it though.  Each time we go, I find myself a little more disappointed. This time we went for dinner, and walking into the restaurant I was disgusted at the amount of crumbs on the floor.  There was food on the floor everywhere-- it looked like my 2 year old niece had thrown a party for all of her friends and they'd thrown food from their highchairs.  I mean, I totally understand if you're slammed you may not have a chance to get to the floor, but there were only three other people in this place at 6 PM on a Saturday!  Someone should have realized the floor was disgusting and grabbed a broom! Anyway... we ordered a burger and chicken sandwich.  Burger was flat, dry, overcooked and nothing special.  Chicken was the same.   On the upside, fries were hot and our sever was pleasant. Sheraton, you need to do something with this property.  The potential for greatness is there, but wow does it disappoint on the follow through."}
{"text":"We had a large party that we called in to ask if they could accommodate for breakfast (which they said they could). We were seated and then waited a while to order. Once we all ordered, food starting coming out 1-4 plates at a time in the order that people ordered about 1.5 hours later! The last person got their plate about 2 hours after ordering. Not only was the food extremely late coming out, but the waiter didn't have any idea what the food was, who it was for, etc. Multiple people in the party never got what they ordered but they took what came out because they never knew if they'd get their food (the waiter apparently didn't either). Apparently they ran out of a lot of food as well. Some people in our party were visibly and obviously frustrated but the waiter did not do a good job helping with these frustrations. In fairness to him, there should not have been one waiter for a party of 25. If they couldn't accommodate our party, they really should have told us. That would have been fine and we could have made reservations with a place that could. The restaurant did comp much of the bill since it was such a terrible experience but I don't think I'd necessarily go back. I'm sure they do much better with smaller parties but this experience didn't do much to convince me. The food was pretty good, though extremely late and likely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing place for happy hour. This is my fourth time here and this time I felt compelled to write a review and post some pictures. Not too many people know about the happy hour. They have three dollar drafts on all of their 20 beers on selection. My favorite food item to order is the pecan chicken salad which is a delicious combination of mixed greens, strawberries, pecans, and grilled chicken. Adam has been my bartender several times and is always on point with customer service. Come here before it gets too crowded for spring training. \"The hidden happy hour gem.\""}
