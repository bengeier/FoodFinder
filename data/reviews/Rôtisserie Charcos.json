{"text":"Just visited this place at lunch today, and I must say, as an avid Romado's fan, this place impressed me. 

MENU
This portuguese rotisserie counter has a good variety on offer including of course chicken (quarter, half or full) offered in standalone or meal variatioms (choice of 2 sides). 

PRICING:
The pricing is pretty decent, though a tad more expensive than its Rachel street counterpart with a 1/2 chicken meal with 2 sides going for 9.95$. Sandwiches seem to range in 6-8$ range. Desserts for 2-4$, drinks for 1.50$-2.50$ (fountain - all you can drink or canned)

DECOR:
The place looks nice and brand spanking new (I'm pretty sure it opened early April) and it does solve one of its competitors main problems - it has seating! 

SERVICE: 
Nothing too crazy at this level, and that's why I'm docking a star here. Taking your order is simple enough, with your name taken down for later retrieval, though the ordering station is awkwardly place near the fountain drinks unfortunately. Next up is payment which is simple enough, but is followed by an excruciatingly long wait for such simple food order. There were 2 orders placed and waiting to be served before my colleague and I and we waited over 10 minutes for our plates to be put on our platters. This did not bode well however the food graciously made up for the wait. I'd strongly recommend trying this place out in a few weeks  when they have their order completion process down pat, and you can go from ordering to eating in no time flat.

FOOD:
The chicken, the coleslaw, the fries and the sauces nothing to fault a true 5 star fast food experience. It nearly reaches the excellence of Romado's, and I think given some time to fine-tune, could very well equal or surpass it as the goto portuguese chicken restaurant. 

ONE LAST LITTLE KNOCK:
This one is more personal, but I would strongly recommend that Charcos management move away from steel cutlery and porcelain plates for those eating in and replace those with either cardboard or styrofoam boxes. The main reasoning behind this suggestion being that you are either left with tables full of dirty plates and cutlery that must be cleared by staff and emptied into awkward trash cans or have your customers to the cleaning themselves which is always a nono, even though many gracious ones will go through the trouble. Extra problems abound by having staff required for cleaning said dishes and cutlery and thereby slowing the order filling even more. Hence, please just use boxes for any order and save everyone a lot of trouble. Plastic cutlery will do just fine as I'd say most people are fine with using their fingers on this sort of delicacy."}
{"text":"In my previous review, I made the argument for Charcos in how they avoided the dreaded \"drama plate\". I ordered something interesting and it managed to taste great without any sort of micro-management.

Alas, I must step down a few paces from my previous praise, because the drama has creeped back in. What used to be gourmet chicken on a budget is now a roll of the dice.

The confidence from my first visit seems gone. Employees seem confused; not sure whether to charge up front or when the food is done. Or what goes on a particular sandwich. The wait time has doubled. The \"wraps\" sometimes use burger buns instead of pitas. The fries sometimes come without that seasoning that worked so well. It's like a roll of the dice with your twenty dollar bill on the line.

Where is that Charcos we were first enthralled with? I hope it comes back soon, because I'm not sure it's worth being burned a third or fourth time by something on the production line."}
{"text":"Meh, I really want to give this place a better review, but I have had a couple bad experiences at the place.

One of those was that they screwed up my order completely.  I order a chicken sandwich with spicy sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions and gave my name.  After I paid and started to bite into my sandwich I got a dose of mayonnaise, olives and corn...I was pretty surprised to say the least!

Also, the service takes a really long time to get anything.  When the line is long don't bother ordering if you are in a rush.

One saving grace, the natas are really good."}
{"text":"This place is located a block or two away from the art museum, so why not come here for some Portuguese chicken? The food here is really good. Musts tries are their Portuguese half chicken, the chicken breast, and their sandwiches. The Portuguese half chicken is served with a spicy Piri Piri sauce, which really brought out the flavor of the chicken. Fresh and very delicious. Plus, it comes with two sides. Try it with the rice, hummus, side salad, or even a chickpea salad. Despite the lack of air condition, the atmosphere is quite nice. Service is fine. Decor, basic and clean. A great place to go to get a quick bite of Portuguese inspired cooking."}
{"text":"Great food! Piri piri sauce is amazing. Service is not the most friendly but good value for price"}
{"text":"Great chicken place and can stand with the big names like Romados and Coco Rico. Service is pretty quick and you can even customize your sandwiches to your liking. Right next to the Concordia Campus and a block away from Crescent street it is really in an ideal location. 

Inside you can find a few tv's and an open kitchen. They serve both fountain drinks and bottle drinks. The specialty sandwiches are uninspiring and are lacking in taste. I have had the grilled chicken several times as well as a few sandwiches. The best bang for your buck is definitely the half grilled chicken with two sides - Comes to about 12$ (You will even have leftovers). 

I have always had good experiences and it is the best chicken you will find downtown west of St Laurent."}
{"text":"If you're in Montreal and you craving chicken, this is the place for you!! One of my top faves in downtown!

Delicious food! Went there once and now im hooked! From the burgers to the chicken wings all the way to the fries.. everything is fingerlicking good! Definitely a must try place!"}
{"text":"Affordable combos-grilled chicken or a sandwich with 2 sides close to the Concordia downtown campus for around 8 bucks. The chicken is always good but the sides often lack luster (mashed potatoes from a box?). Speedy service and convenient location."}
{"text":"Good portuguese chicken, fast service and affordable price makes this restaurant a excellent choice. Instead of going to a fast food just take a look at this restaurant, for the same price you'll have a great meal ! I tried a couple of portuguese restaurant and the Piri piri sauce of Charcos are these best i've taste, they surely made it from the real Piri piri  pepper and a friend of mine told me so   ! 
 

Pour du bon poulet portugais à prix abordable c'est ici qu'il faut aller, à 2 pas de l'université Concordia, à la place de manger du fast-food pourquoi ne pas manger du poulet portugais ! La sauce à base de piment piri piri est la meilleure que j'ai goutée à Montréal et un amis m'a dis que cette sauce est vraiment faite avec le fameux piment portugais !"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! either eat in or take out.. its a great lunch or dinner option. The salads are all good, fries are super tasty with the salt and fresh pepper. And the chicken? burgers!? You have GOT to try this place if you are in Montreal. It should be at the top of the list if you want some amazing rotisserie chicken. The staff are also awesome! Very helpful and smiley and friendly."}
{"text":"Attentive service, cheap, and finally a Portuguese chicken rotisserie in the heart of downtown that is almost on par with its greatest competitor, Romados. 

If you're not starving, you can simply enjoy a delicious chicken sandwich with your choice of fillings. If you've got a bigger appetite then the quarter, half, or full chicken with a choice of 2 sides will be sure to satisfy your needs. They're fries are also pretty damn good!

Charcos is an up and coming place, it just opened earlier this year but has the potential of working wonders with a little bit of fine tuning."}
{"text":"Charcos serves tasty, well-seasoned chicken, sides and fries at a fair price. You can't beat the quarter leg platter, spicy, with two sides for $8. They're busy so be clear on what you want or you may be surprised. They'll serve it to go if you're in a hurry. Well worth trying!"}
{"text":"Fast food Portuguese Chicken. Not the best, but not completely awful. 

I got the chicken poutine and it was cheap and fast service.
The fries were very hard and the chicken did not mix well with the gravy. It was a pretty bad meal.

The chicken on its own is not bad. A bit dry but depends on the days.

It's conveniently located next to Concordia so it's hard to avoid."}
{"text":"I was heading home after a long session at the gym, all energies depleted, thinking in my mind what I was going to prepare at home to refuel but I was so hungry and just as I walked by this place I said to myself that needed to stop and eat something quickly as a premeal. 

I had the Philadelphia sandwich which has marinated grilled thin beef slices served on a baguette with caramelized onions, mushrooms, and green peppers, topped with melted mozzarella cheese and mayo. Very nice, it did the trick and they prepared quite fast.

The place inside looks nice, I like it when they use granite tables. They grill on charcoal. It is not the best Grillade in Montreal, but in this corner it is the only one and it is pretty good."}
{"text":"I had a grilled chicken wrap. The chicken looked like a processed breast with painted-on grill marks. The toppings for the wrap are no better than at Subway. They painted on a lot of Piri-Piri; I have no idea whether they make this sauce, but my guess is no. The wrap was greasy and soggy because of all the sauce. It was expensive considering what it was. This is not the sort of Portuguese chicken place that the Plateau is known for,  it is a poor facsimile. I would only eat it again because it is close but beware. I didn't have any fries but the ones they were serving looked old and limp - a travesty as far as portuguese chicken goes! Don't expect anything good."}
{"text":"Great menu that has Portuguese style chicken as well as som Mediterranean food. The food was fresh and tasty. I had the Portuguese chicken breast. It was okay. Just don't expect Romados. But an absolute winner for a downtown location. It was quick, the place has plenty of room. Service was great. All in all a great place."}
{"text":"On a rainy saturday evening after long hours in front of Tv it was time to give some attention to my appetite for a real meal and not fill myself up with some snacks, got downtown and while beeing on Maisoneuve street i saw Charcos, decided it was the lucky winner for tonights feast ! Their menu is very diversified the food is really nice the food is prepared very quickly, i had a philadelphia sandwich (philly cheese steak) the bread was fresh, the quantity of cheese was generous and the steak was lovely and cooked at perfect with green peppers and caramelized onions !! I really wasnt satisfied by the customer service :(! I saw on the menu fresh smoothies so i asked the lady at the cash if it was available at this time (9:45pm) she actually told me we are too busy let me check, she gave me my sandwich i had to eat it and then go pay and still had gotten no reply so i asked again after paying if it was possible to have a smoothie and this time she told me we are too busy to make it :(:( i was very sad but at least the taste of the sandwich compensated !"}
{"text":"I tried Charcos thanks to one of their Facebook promos. Had a half chicken meal with 2 sides, fries and hummus.

Chicken is tasty, well cooked and seasoned well with some of their red sauce with a hint of spiciness. Fries were typical of other places, homestyle, thick cut.
Their hummus is delicious although I'm not sure why that is offered as a side as I wasn't sure how to eat it. I ended dipping my fries or pieces of chicken in it but I'm usually  used to eating it with bread.

Everything is reasonably priced. For ten bucks, you'll get a fair amount of food.
Service was slow and a bit awkward. When entering, you're not sure where to order and once your place your order, you're sitting at the table waiting for your food to be called, not knowing when to pay. Ends up I got to pay after eating my meal and hanging there for a good hour.
I was there on Saturday around 8pm and it was not busy. If it is hectic, I would imagine the service being even slower so you can't really go in and walk out with your food to go.

The place looks nice and clean, marbled tables and counter top, including the bathroom. There are a couple tv screens. Free wifi.  A good location to hang out, they also serve  coffee, smoothies and desserts."}
{"text":"The chicken is amazing and they have a lot of salad choices. The portions are big so it can do for two lunches for someone with my apetite!

Edit: used to love the place but last time I went I was sick all night so... can't go anymore. But that's once in 4 time, it might've been something else..."}
