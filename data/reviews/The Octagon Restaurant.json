{"text":"My experience at The Octagon Restaurant was akin to that of a woman's experience on her cycle. It was a clusterfk of emotions...all out of whack, and all undetermined.

The evening started out good and bad. When we arrived, the parking lot was full, so the valet person told us to go away (WTF?) the valet line was backed up so bad and they were so unprofessional and rude about it; we literally decided to drive onto the separating garden island thing to get out (we keeps it classy lol). We didn't notice the cops on the street watching us from maybe a stone's throw away. They watched us ride first class on that struggle bus as we broke every traffic law in the book. They paused momentarily then LAUGHED (dafuq?!). We finally parked in the next plaza down at the farmer's market.

We were a group of 14, so naturally they sent us upstairs to one of the private rooms (had a door and errtang). THOSE STAIRS NEED RENOVATING DOE. NARROW ASS CASA LOMA ASS LOOKIN (if you've ever done that journey to the top) 1905-SECRET-STEPS RESEMBLIN STEPS. NO! Tight short skirts/ dresses, heels, and narrow  steps DO NOT GO TOGETHER. You have to walk by the ENTIRE DINING ROOM to get to the stairs btw. Great architectural planning, Octagon (smh). Anyways, upon entering the otherwise perfectly beautiful establishment, you are immediately welcomed by the owner (methinks). He's possibly the ONLY competent customer service provider on the entire team. A nice small bald man. He takes your jacket off (and on) for you (complimentary coat check). The first thing I noticed after the gorgeous deep mahogany wooden walls, fireplace, framed art, stained glass windows, antique decor, dim lights, and classy ambiance, was the service. We had about 3 waiters assigned to us, and they were absolutely professional...AT FIRST. Lookin' all busy n' shit. They be wipin' down their foreheads, huffin n' puffin all up in my personal bubble in attempt to silently enunciate their strong desire for a generous tip I assume (made me uncomfortable). You're pouring a glass of water, calm yourself. Mind you these waiters are relatively older men, ones who look like they done had their midlife crisis back in the  80's.

Food came, no confusion with orders. Everything cooked to everyone's desired rareness/ tenderness. Maybe a little under-seasoned, but that's okay, it was still good. The food chapter of this evening was smooth sailing and we experienced no problems. JOKES! You know bout that pms doe, it'll seem all proper and shit until it rears its ugly ass head to bite you in the tuchus! The calm before the storm. Ya feel? So, everyone was I guess just about finished eating. EXCEPT, WE WEREN'T. HOW ARE YOU GONNA TAKE AWAY MY MEAL BEFORE I FINISH IT?! HOW ARE YOU STILL EMPLOYED TAKING AWAY A PLATE FULL OF FOOD! BRO. FACEPALM! I actually have no words for you, actually that's a lie, this review is longer than any essay I've written in my university life. And then you have the temerity to say it was an empty plate. I KID YOU NOT, the mans tried to argue with me that there was nothing on the plate. And then he proceeded to tell me that it's on the kitchen table, he will bring it back, that it hasn't been thrown out yet. Are you ready for this next bit? (As if that last statement wasn't messed up enough on its own, bout \"on the kitchen table, bring it back\"). THIS GUY BRINGS BACK SOME NEXXX PERSON'S HALF EATEN MEAL. #DEAD. Yelp, I can't even make this shit up if I tried. I was so flabbergasted and shocked, I didn't know how to respond to that. So, I kind of just stood there in silence for a moment with bewilderment in eyes, I straight up looked anencephalic. MY GAWD. Oh yeah, and then they asked us to pay for the meal we never ate (These guys lol). The manager got involved, after 15 infuriating minutes of arguing, they offered a free dessert, I didn't want dessert, so it was finally voided. But in a restaurant as \"reputable\" as The Octagon, who markets themselves a certain way and ensures a \"fine-dining\" experience, I feel like it should've been handled much more professionally, and the problem should've never arisen to begin with. The offer to void the meal should've come from their end without a debate. What kind of business argues with their patrons and shames them?! 

Finally, PAYMENT TIME. Ohhh muhfkn boy! You ready fuhdis? Our bill was $800?-ish. Which is more than reasonable. (BTW, YOU CAN'T SPLIT BILLS HERE, come prepared with cash). We were never made aware of this over the phone, or before eating even (Thanks again!). So our waiter now starts giving us mad attitude. He made it be known he was irritated with us (who fkd up doe? Don't be displacing your anger onto me, I'm the one with an empty stomach). So, I put the bill on my visa, and WOAH, THIS GUY ACTUALLY THREW MY CARD BACK AT ME. LIKE PHYSICALLY THREW MY CARD AT  ME. O___O WHATTT?! WHO THE FF. I SWEAR THAT'S HARASSMENT. Nope, I'm done. My blood pressure is rising, I can feel a hormonal imbalances just now."}
{"text":"I spent our Christmas Dinner with my girlfriend this year. The only thing that's good is the salad. The steaks were ok only, they were quite dry. I don't think they worth over $50 per order. Also the service wasn't good either. This is gonna be the first and last time we dine there."}
{"text":"Very pricey place, but shows for it- incredible service and great food. Always come here with the family for big occasions. The bread is to die for. 
Recommendations: 
Apps:
escargot, shrimp, caesar salad (portions are for at least two and they make it right in front of your table- try not to add/subtract anything because you'll be surprised at how good it is the way they make it)

Mains:
filet mignon and salmon

Dessert:
molten lava cake"}
{"text":"Hardly worth it. the steaks are less than average and the service is poor (we ordered french onion soup which never came, and they mixed up a medium rare order with a rare one).  Overall, one of the worst dining experiences I've ever been to and thoroughly disappointing considering that they have built up a reputation of being one of the best steakhouses in toronto"}
{"text":"We go here a lot the servers are very nice the decor is very nice and the food is consistently good. All the steaks such as the the porter house, the filet, and the ny strip are really good and the salads are really good. Also the coconut cream pie is awesome!"}
{"text":"Definitely a nice place with terrific service and excellent ambiance. With the dim lighting, would be the place for a romantic evening with a loved one.

The food here is delicious. I had the scallop, shrimps for appetizers, which were simply scrumptous. The veal oscar with crabmeat was nicely prepared and well done.

I was stuffed after the meal, I could not look at the dessert menu...so can't comment on this. 

Definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for the first time and was impressed by the service and quality of the food. The ambiance was very nice and the food was amazing. I like the fact that this restaurant offers a variety of foods for different eaters. Such as having more smaller portion steaks at a reasonable price for those who don't eat a lot. I had the caesar salad and new york strip steak when I was there and was quite amazed at how flavorful the steak was in comparison to other restaurants, and the fact that the caesar salad is made right at the table. Would definitely visit this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner at Octagon this week with a group of 10 people. They seated us in a private room with our own real fireplace. The restaurant and the room we were in was really beautiful - very old looking, dark woods, paintings, etc. 
The menu is mainily steak and seafood - I don't think there's much for vegetarians - sorry Michelle A.
The food was really good! - I ordered filet mignon for my main - (I'm not a steak expert but I thought it was good and everyone else seemed happy with their meals as well ) 
Two people orderd lobster tails - they're enormous and looked really good. 
I would recommend for a special occasion as it is quite pricey!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for over 10 years but the last trip was the last. Their prices have been hiked again and it is no longer worth the money they charge.Shall miss the Octogan and the great food they serve but I will not throw my money."}
{"text":"Come here for the steaks.  Don't order anything else.  It's more like 3.5 stars ( 4.5 stars for the steaks, 2 stars for everything else)

We ordered the escargots and bacon wrapped scallops for appertizers. Escargots were average.   Bacon wrapped scallops was very underwhelming for the price (around $22-$24) .

We ordered the 24oz bone in rib eye and the octagon cut prime rib.  Both were excellent melt in your mouth.    

The 2 sides(fries and mash potatoes) that come with the steaks were a big disappointment.  Probably the worst fries and mash I have had in a long time.

We ordered a coconut cream pie to share.  Don't order please.  

Overall, just order steaks here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Place was OK. I rely on yelp almost exclusively as I travel often for work and love finding new, great restaurant's while on the road. I will say that this was one of the very few times my fellow yelper's seem to 'over sell' a little bit. It wasn't bad but the decor is very drab, old school, and stuffy. Some people perhaps enjoy that but if you are looking for a high end steak/meal with a fun and lively atmosphere, this is def NOT the place. They don't even have a bar you can sit at to eat/drink if you are dining by yourself. My food wasn't bad but it certainly doesn't fall anywhere near my top steakhouse list...a list i have to say I take very seriously. It seems there are much better steakhouses in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"The Octagon is a really beautiful restaurant, with lots of stained glass and wood paneling.  It feels really old school, or like a steakhouse from a movie.  The atmosphere is upscale but very cozy and nice.

Our food was excellent.  My husband ordered the rib eye, and he said it was one of the best steaks he has ever eaten.  

I am a vegetarian.  We came to the Octagon because it was my husband's birthday and I am an awesome wife.  I was expecting to order a salad and maybe a few vegetable sides for dinner, but the waiter offered to put together a veggie plate for me.  It was EXCELLENT! It was heaped with broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, julienned peppers, a roasted tomato, grilled mushrooms, and a baked potato.  I am sure that no one is reading this review because they are curious about the vegetarian options at a steakhouse, but I cannot emphasize enough how thrilled I was with my dinner.  I didn't even have to eat the emergency granola bar I had in my purse.

This would have been a 5-star review if it wasn't for the service.  It seemed a little...uneven.  I noticed that other tables regularly had their water glasses refilled or the crumbs scraped from the table cloth.  Our waiters came by to take our orders and deliver the food, but that was all.  The waiters were polite and professional, but not warm or friendly, or particularly attentive.  I might not have noticed if it wasn't for the calibre of service I saw at some of the other tables.

Overall, I would still recommend the Octagon for a special occasion dinner.  Hopefully you will have better luck with the wait staff."}
{"text":"The ceaser salad is a must try as they prepare it at the table. Literally from scratch starting with the salad dressing. We had everything added in the sauce and it was delicious.

The steak was done to perfection. Nice and juicy. :) We ordered a Filet Mignon and a Peppercorn steak. Loved the peppercorn sauce. I ordered medium rare for the mignon and it came out medium rare. :)

Dessert was pretty good. Tried the coconut cream pie, but the white chocolate shavings made the tart a bit too sweet for me. The Warm moist chocolate cake, was actually a lava cake with a waffle bowl next to it filled with French vanilla ice cream? :)

The wait staff were old school and attentive. Really good service for sure. Prompt, fast, not a lot of little talk. Very professional."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is one of the best steakhouses in the city. Been here multiple times for special occasions and have never been disappointed. I usually order my steaks rare or medium rare, both are cooked to perfection here.

Also recommended is the Caesar salad for two. They freshly make it right by your table and is excellent. Although it's a bit pricey at around $15 per person, it is definitely different to have it freshly made right in front of you.

Another plus is the garlic bread they offer. These are some of the best garlic breads I've had.

For special occasions I would definitely recommend The Octagon."}
{"text":"Went: Sun Nov 1st, 6:00 p.m. (74/100)

The décor is quite attractive, having a church-like feel to it. The wood work and stained glass was exquisite. When I opened the door to go down the hall to use the restroom, I was very impressed at the beautiful wooden hallway. It was unique and felt very upscale. That was a wow moment. The design of the hall extended to the washrooms, and it was either the nicest washroom I've been to at a restaurant or very close. That's the good news.

If you are looking for exquisite and attentive customer service ... keep on looking because you will not find it here! Our waiter was not friendly, did not smile and did not attempt to create a memorable occasion for us. From what I could tell, that was how other waiters treated other patrons. It must be some mandate from above, but they should rethink it, because I think it will turn a lot of people off.  In some Asian restaurants, the waitresses are cold and functional and that is the vibe I got here. For the prices we were paying, I think some TLC should be part of the service, and was disapprovingly absent.

They seated us in a way where we are right angles from one another which I did not really like.

We had the escargot, six in total.  I dipped the escargot thoroughly in sauce that came with it and did not taste much, the flavour being missing. The last piece I ate I tasted more of the flavour I expected. My date thought the garlic bread was well done, and it was but no one is blown away by garlic bread. They gave us complimentary pickled peas, olives and dill pickles. The pickles tasted like they came out of a can. The olives were nice and the pickled peas were different but not really for us I think.

We ordered a 24 oz bone-in rib-eye. The outside was blackened and seared. The meat near the end was more medium than the medium rare we requested. The steak itself was pretty good, though I remember going \"hmmm\" at our two previous steakhouses, Ruth's Chris and Elements at Niagara Falls, and I did not do that here. My date found some so the pieces a little tough. I dipped each piece in the pool of meat juices; otherwise it would be bland. I find I didn't have to do this at other steak places. It wasn't the exceptional steak I was hoping to find. With the steak came garlic mashed potatoes and three large mushrooms. These were both very good.

The impressive décor could not make up for lack of customer service and high price vs. quality of the food. I would not recommend it to others and I definitely would not come back."}
{"text":"For special  occasions, we always dine here!  The service is impeccable!  Friendly and courteous!  The table side Cesar salad is fabulous!  We love watching them make it.  As for dinner, it's always the Prime Rib.   Always cooked medium rare to perfection.  Accompanied with garlic mashed potatoes, it doesn't get any better than this!"}
{"text":"As mentioned in previous reviews, Octagon is an old school steakhouse.  It's not quite \"Mad Men\" and \"Goodfellas\" old school, but it's about as close as you can get.  As you sit in the dimly lit restaurant surrounded by dark wood, stained glass windows, and somewhat kitschy decor, you can almost imagine Don Draper or Henry Hill sitting in the corner booth enjoying a mighty fine steak.  Speaking of the corners, the main room of this restaurant is indeed shaped like an Octagon - go figure!
The old school feel also extends to the service.  I have been to Octagon a number of times and have never seen or been served by a waitress.  The wait staff appears to consist entirely of males dressed in suits and ties - doesn't get much more old school than that.  The service is attentive, prompt, and friendly.  The waiters are also quite informative should you have any questions.
To start, my wife and I had the caesar salad for two.  This salad is prepared table-side with the dressing being made from scratch from its component ingredients in a wooden bowl which, we were informed, is made from a single solid piece of wood.  This was a great start to the meal as it was very interesting to observe the salad being prepared and it was also very good!  The salad had a good amount of garlic, anchovies, and bacon which made it delicious.  Now, vegetarians, vegans, and other individuals who do not consume red meat need not read any further.  
For the main course, I had the New York Striploin while my wife had the prime rib and both cuts of beef were superb!  The steak comes served by itself on a very hot plate.  Sides such as the baked potato was served on a separate small plate.  The steak was also prepared as requested (medium-rare) and the overall flavour left nothing further to be desired.  It was perfectly seared and perfectly seasoned.  All in all, the steak was thoroughly enjoyable.
Octagon also had a decent wine list.  Not the most extensive I have come across, but it was varied enough that I don't believe anyone would have a difficult time finding a nice wine to go with their steak.  And personally, I can't think of a better combination than a great steak and a fantastic wine!
After stuffing my belly full of beef, I had absolutely no room for dessert so I cannot comment on the quality of the desserts.
If you enjoy a good steak, you should strongly consider a meal at Octagon.  It may be pricier than some steak restaurants, but considering the quality of the steaks, I would say the prices are quite fair.  Furthermore, the only way you could enjoy a more authentic old school steakhouse experience would be to invent a time machine."}
{"text":"Great steaks. You're paying a bit of a premium for the ambiance . This is another steakhouse that prepares the Caesar salad table-side - a bit expensive but tasty and entertaining. Total $100-125 per person."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday evening for a business meeting. The place has a large dining area but each table has an intimate feel to it. The restaurant also has private rooms to host private parties. I had the pleasure of being seated in one of those private rooms. Right away, you notice the friendly service. The staff was very helpful from coat check right to the very end when our evening was finishing up. The ambiance was very classy. The noise level was not too loud. I started with crab cakes and shrimp cocktail to share with friends. The crab cakes were delicious. They were not overdone but cooked to perfection. They had a creamy sauce to add a delicate flavour and you can squeeze a drizzle of lemon over too add tartness to the crab cake. The shrimp cocktail was good; however, the shrimp was the size of a small lobster! I had a prime rib. I asked for medium and came out as ordered. As for the sides, I had a baked potato and steamed vegetables. Both of them were average. For dessert, I had the pecan pie with a scoop of ice cream on top. The pie was not too sweet or rich. It is quite expensive, but the food is great and the service is excellent. It is a great place to go for a celebration with friends."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this Steakhouse and we knew it wasn't cheap either... never the less, we decided to go there yesterday to celebrate my birthday. The service at first was nice, and then as we were about to finish our food, not quite finished, they already started pushing us to finish and started taking all our plates away, we had to literally tell them \"we are still working on this...\" So as they stopped taking our plates away, and they immediately handed us the bill... we weren't even done eating! for God's sake... after handing us the bill, they came to the table every 30 seconds to see if we are ready to pay... my wife had to tell the waiter \"please don't check on the bill for at least 20 min... we are not done yet.\"
I'm assuming it was because our daughter started crying and it was bothering them. Still, it was very very rude! So I wouldnt plan on this place if you have kids...

From the food point of view, and only from the food point of view, I had the Bone in Rib Steak which costs $65.95CAD, the steak was ordered Medium, and on the inside it was close to that, however, the outside of the Steak was all burned and had a bad taste to it, I had to pill off the burned parts. The Fries that came with it were pretty much a joke for a $65 dollar Entree... they looked like they came out of MacDonald's.
 My wife has a fillet of Sol and it was OK, but not great.

All in all we will probably never come back here nor will we recommend it to any of our friends. For the same price I would recommend harbor 60 steakhouse which is a true 5 star Steakhouse"}
{"text":"Made reservations for a special night here. The food was delicious and the service was more than quality from the moment we stepped into the restaurant to leaving. I must say, the overall experience was lovely. I would certainly recommend The Octagon restaurant to anyone looking to eat out in a friendly yet classy and beautiful setting."}
{"text":"The Octagon is actually shaped like an octagon on the interior! Although, extremely dark (making it difficult to take decent pictures), the ambiance is classy/romantic furnished with vintage pieces. You'd never guess that this place once burned down and was rebuilt - the old school atmosphere is certainly still there!

The service is excellent. There were at least three different wait staff serving our table, and all were very friendly. They made great recommendations from their extensive wine list - by the glass, half bottle or full bottle. 

What was ordered:
1. Caesar Salad (for 2) - Freshly made at your table in a large wooden bowl. The trainee that made the salad for the first time apparently added too much olive oil (which I did not notice at all) and the manager who walked by apologized profusely and made a fresh one for us himself. The way he whipped up that salad, I'm surprised at how they keep their suits so clean! 

2. Bacon-Wrapped Scallops - Oh my god, this was delicious! I will be ordering this every time I come back. The scallops are cooked to perfection, with the center melting in your mouth. The bacon isn't overly-salty, and complemented the enormous scallops perfectly. 

3. Filet Mignon 8oz - I ordered my steak medium-rare, and out it came medium-rare. PERFECTO!  I was pretty full at this point, but I couldn't help myself and finished this extremely tender and juicy entree. 

4. Prime Rib - The boyfriend ordered this and his thoughts: \"Very tender, but maybe too fatty.\" He asked for it to be served as rare as possible, and honestly, the rarest prime ribs come is medium-rare. For the regular cut, the size of the prime rib was very generous. I wonder how large the Octagon cut is..

5. Coconut Cream Pie - The BEST dessert I've tasted at a steakhouse. Seriously, this is a must-order. They don't always have this available, so call ahead and reserve your pie! The crust on the bottom is perfect - not too hard, and not too flaky - and every bite you'll taste coconut!

6. New York Cheesecake - This was pretty meh (especially after the coconut cream pie). For cheesecake enthusiasts, this may not be creamy enough for you. 

The surprising part is the bill: 
The bill came out to be around $190, including two glasses of wine we ordered! I don't know, but I was expecting somewhere around $300 based on how much we ordered.. 

Octagon, I will be back! You've got yourself a new regular!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm Octagon has GREAT steak!! If you want a steak house that has food on par with Ruth's Chris, Keg, Morton's, etc. but you don't want to drive downtown, Octagon is a great choice.  The decor is dark wood old-world Italian and maybe even a little gaudy for my taste, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. The service is excellent and attentive, and most importantly, the steak is always done perfectly. Plus how cool is it that the building is octagon shaped?!

I was there last friday on a whim and it wasn't full so my group of six was seated immediately, but during summer I've also tried to get in without a reservation on a friday night and been turned away because there was a two hour wait.  Last time I was there, I had the filet mignon, and it was cooked perfectly, and was so tender the meat literally melted in my mouth.

For dessert, try the strawberries with Grand Marnier sauce - the sauce is delicious!!

There is a sign outside the door that states their dress code, which is something like business casual, but some of my group was wearing sneakers and t-shirts (not me!! hehe) and they still let us in without even blinking an eye, but I did feel a little underdressed."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is lavish, the food is pretty top notch, I had the steak Neptune and escargots, boyfriend had the baby back ribs for appetizer (the weren't fall off the bone but still tasty) and the rib eye bone in was delish. Garlic bread is very good. The service was really great our waiter was attentive and personable. The only things they were missing was that extra touch that Peters Fine Dining offers (asking if it's a special occasion and doing something to celebrate it and of course the rose) for those that have been, you know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Went there around two weeks ago with another couple. The ambiance was amazing, however, the food did not reflect that. 

We ordered the seafood platter for two, Caesar salad (from the back) and a rib-steak bone in. The steak was very good but the seafood platter was subpar - and for $205.00, it was simply outrageous. I have been to other establishments where they have this item and it is better quality with more food such as filet mignon, and approximately $40 less expensive. Their platter came with no meat, only seafood.

Caesar salad was $17.00, it was good but far from the best I've ever had. 

All of us have never been there before, and likely never to return."}
{"text":"Went here for my 4 year anniversary from a friend's recommendation. We loved our steaks. They were huge, and they were SO good that even when we microwaved it the next day it was STILL good. Remarkable!"}
{"text":"I went to this place with coworkers. It is really classy, the crab cakes were amazing, the new York steak amazing and no fatty at all, the coconut dessert was so good. I love it!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best classic steakhouses in the GTA.  For a nice cut of meat, this is definitely the place to go.  We were a party of 4 and all of our steaks were cooked perfectly to our liking.  This place is business casual attire at the minimum so dress accordingly.  The service is top notch.  The salads were tossed right beside your table.  Great selection of wines is a must and they have it.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed.  It's a pricey menut but the quality is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant but expensive. One look at the neighborhood and you'll see why. Free valet parking on busy nights but there is a lot you can use free.  Good garlic bread, olives are great.  Soups are good and affordable, but many appetizers are getting too high ... such as $36 for Caesar Salad for two.  Peppercorn stead is wonderful $59.  Chateaubriand for 2 is $109.  Friendly staff.  Open for lunch too, but not as busy as it is at night - reserve ahead."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, experienced staff and The portions are pretty big, the Caesar salad is a must have, they make the sauce and salad right in front of you, also the lobster bisque is very good, steak is very juicy, we finished with coconut tart, overall everything was very good! Will for sure go back again!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The second time was with my daughters who are always well behaved. My thought is that The Octagon does not like you bringing your children to dinner. The service that night was deplorable. Because of that, I have not and never will return. Too bad that Eddy's closed, had to retire at some point, that place was so superior in so many ways. There are still other and better steakhouses in the GTA that deserve your patronage over The Octagon.

{"text":"This steakhouse has been on my hotlist for a while now and I finally had an occasion worth going for. Have always been a little hesitant due to the pricing but decided to give it a shot and see what they were all about. Very nice old school classic steakhouse with stained glass windows and interesting decorations. Complimentary valet parking is a nice extra but honestly completely unnecessary as the parking lot is very small and close to the restaurant but I suppose older patrons appreciate it. The service was good, although like other reviews I've read I also found they were either rushing us and hovering over the table and then nowhere to be found in the 2nd half of the meal. My mother in law also told she had been here before and they were treating her not very nicely because her English isn't very good. For the prices they charge and in this area service should be impeccable to everyone that walks through the door. Aside from being hard to find in the latter half of my meal the server was polite and on point if not a bit rushing. For apps we tried escargot and onion soup, these were not the best and to be honest the keg does these dishes much much better and for less. Everything else was good, some pickled vegetables for side appetizers and garlic bread was nice and very garlicky. The steaks were excellent! Cooked well and delicious, I found my New York peppercorn to be definitely one of the better steaks I've had in the city. My wife found her filet mignon to be a bit dry. Typically filet mignon is a less fatty cut that drys out easily which is why so many places wrap it in bacon to keep in the moisture but octagon just serves it straight up so expect a dryer steak if you are getting the filet. Otherwise everything else was really good. This is worth an experience to go once but I'd skip on appetizers and just go with steaks and drinks. They have a very nice wine list. Overall I don't feel the prices are justified and bang for buck I'd choose keg over octagon but if you're trying to impress for a business meeting or something it could be the place to go."}
{"text":"Octagon is king for steaks and a full dining experience in York Region. Nothing I've had has ever been anything less than perfect. The details in the decor, the world class service, the preparation of the Cesar salad in front of your eyes and the massive porterhouse steaks keep me coming back. The only other steakhouse I'm willing to go to in the GTA for an upscale meal is Barbarians. Both old school and have a formula that works."}
{"text":"This was our go to steakhouse!!! When in the city  Until tonight!!!  Cesar salad for two was way to sour!!  Not enough anchovies and garlic.  The garlic bread was just toasted bread, with no taste!  I ordered my favorite Prime Rib, and it was awful!  Dry, tasteless, and no au jus.  I ordered medium rare, and got medium!  We were also rushed to complete our meal, so that they may turn the table, for more profit.  All in all a real disappointment!!  Too bad!!!"}
{"text":"Where have all the steak houses gone? Sure, we can go anywhere for a steak, but for the classic \"steak house\" experience, only a few tried and true favourites that have dotted the Toronto restaurant landscape remain.

At the north end of Toronto is a Thornhill staple, Octagon Restaurant. When a fire burned it to the ground in 1992, all that remained, ironically, was the fireplace.

A grand renovation included an original belle époque cast iron doorway gilded with 24 carat gold from the St. Regis Hotel in New York. Rich décor includes 18th century stained-glass panels from a Belgian Church; European oil paintings; Mahogany, walnut and European olive wood paneling and intricate carvings; custom-made Tiffany lamps; chandeliers; brass wall fixtures; and leather banquets providing the requisite grandeur for this Victorian style \"jewel box\".

Dress code is business casual. The room is all about the presentation and the ambience. The plating is about the food.

Prepared table side, the Caesar salad of crisp romaine is creamy and garlic-y with bacon and crunchy croutons that would make Caesar proud. They sure don't skimp on the scampi. Shrimp cocktail is colossal. Plump, meaty shrimp are served on iceberg lettuce accompanied by a tangy in-house made cocktail sauce. Lip smacking baby back ribs are charcoal grilled for a smoky essence, and slicked with a zesty barbeque sauce. Good thing they provide us finger bowls, because we need both hands to devour this ample portion.

The wine cellar is fully stocked to match the menu. While the appetizers pique our appetites, we've come here for the charcoal broiled steaks, and are ready for our 16 ounce rib eye. Sizzling, juicy and tender this corn-fed beef packs flavour and needs no sauce or garnish to set my taste buds dancing. Quality meat prepared with care and consistency has enabled the Octagon its longevity. Enjoying every mouthwatering bite, and engaged in conversation, we don't even notice how seamlessly our attentive waiter refills our glasses.

Dare we ask for dessert? Rich coconut cream pie and a soft crust mini pecan pie sprinkled with cocoa and drizzled with a chocolate sauce are made specially for Octagon. Served warm and a la mode, these lush sweets punctuate a decadent feast for the senses."}
{"text":"A super-old-school Steakhouse with a gentleman's club meets Catholic Church type of environment, with lots of wood paneling and stained glass, plus solid service and food quality, however I feel the price point promises more than the experience ultimately delivers.

I've been here several times now and there's never been anything wrong. I always have good food and good service, but it always feels like everything is just not quite impressive or worth bragging about, considering Octagon's fine dining aspirations and price point.

I love the old school garlic bread, and the pickle, olive and pepperoncini platter, and the prime rib in particular is usually very good. But price, and portion, and overall experience, all certainly fall a few steps behind steak houses in Toronto.

The Octagon is simply not in the same league with Tier 1 steak houses in Toronto like Harbour Sixty or Jacob and Co. And I would suggest that it lands in the lower end of the Tier 2 places, delivering a more upscale environment, but similar food quality, to a place like Smith Brothers in Scarborough.

So in the end, I've always had a solid meal, with solid service, and I've enjoyed repeatedly devouring huge baskets of garlic bread, plus a ton of olives and skinny hot peppers, so I typically leave feeling satisfied, but like things didn't quite manage to live up to the price I paid."}
{"text":"TL;dr beautiful interior and good service but this old fashioned establishment is not worth the big bucks.


Service was very attentive but not perfect. Although our orders were written down, the sides were messed up and the servers blamed the food runner on the mistake when it wasn't he who punched in the chit.

I did feel like I was dining in a high end establishment and I appreciated the old school style of the waiters. I never felt like they were 'doing me a favor' by serving me as you sometimes feel at high end restaurants downtown. No chips on shoulders here!

now, the food..

the garlic bread, pickles, olives and hot peppers were very good, but that's not what I'm coming for.

the 18 dollar a person Cesar salad was skillfully prepared but was very bland. it needed some seasoning, whether it be more parmesan or some salt, but maybe they are just staying within the main theme of the food at the octagon, which is that nothing is seasoned.

I'm talking about salt and pepper, flavour enhancer!!

My rib eye was cooked as I had ordered it but it did not see even one fleck of salt before it hit the grill.

aesthetically, grill marks were randomly distributed and it was sitting in a huge puddle of juice, accompanied by the saddest greyish brown mushrooms you've ever seen. the eye of my rib eye was not tender. I've had much better rib eyes at the keg.

my steak was a huge disappointment, especially considering that steaks are their speciality.

I ordered fries hoping for thin, crispy frites but received a pile of unseasoned wavy cut disks of fried frozen potato. I tried the garlic mashed potatoes which were also awful. 

two people with my group ordered the ribs which are probably the best value on the menu. the ribs I tried were well cooked, not the overcooked mush that releases from the bone with no effort that most people seem to think good ribs are like. the only problem was that they were barely sauced. 


with tax and tip, we averaged just under 75 a person which is 50 bucks too much.

I came here 17 years ago for my 13th birthday but I don't foresee myself visiting again in the next 17."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, complimentary valet and coat check.  The Octagon is the definition of a true steakhouse! We ordered the ribeye and salmon, both were cooked to perfection.  Wasn't a fan of the medallion fries or baked potato- both were very bland.  The Greek salad was tiny, and just enough to share.  My next visit, I would skip the sides and just order mains.  Overall great food, decent prices for a steakhouse and wonderful service."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. NO TV; No WIFI;  and thank God. 

One negative in my books. No dress code enforced. Unkept people in old dirty jeans does not enhance the experience. 

Been there a dozen times and will go back."}
{"text":"I wouldn't agree with the $$$ it's definitely a $$$$ but that's beside the point.  The restaurant has a lot of history and has been on the same lot for over 40 years.  So it probably was there when Thornhill was more of a town outside Toronto then it is now.  But I digress.

The meal was excellent the steaks where cooked to perfection and what I am more amazed by you can order anything off the menu and not be disappointed.  My wife and i had a 24oz rib steak on the bone which is generally difficult to cook properly since it is very thick and bone usually presents a problem for most people but not here.

The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that the building may be old but it shouldn't be this stuffy even at full capacity."}
{"text":"Great decor.  Horrible service. Scallop was good, but one of four didn't have bacon wrapped.  Server THREW DOWN the steak and ran away from our table. Never asked once how thing were. Steak was bland and only warm-ish.   Mash potato tasted like cotton.  I'm not a picky guy normally, but this place really disappointed.  Sad because the decor really is epic.   But this place is probably the worst high end steak house I've ever been to!!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I am not having a good experience in the octagon ! 
First of all the food is not that good at all it does not match the high end quality that the restaurant is delivering. I ordered sea bass and the little tiny piece of fish came with a side of tasteless boiled cauliflower pieces and beans , it absolutely had no taste what so ever, that was it on my plate, I left very hungry and not satisfied for the price I payed for that dish. And the service I find judges you on how much food you order they are nicer if you order more expensive dishes. 
Me and my friend came to have wine and an appetizer last time and we got told that for the next time we are not allowed to just order an appetizer. never mind that we shared expensive wine with that and out bill came to more than a 100$. I will not comeback to the restaurant again!"}
{"text":"You want killer Prime Rib and the absolute best Caesar salad in the GTA? The Octagon is your place. 

I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because the decor is mega old school, and won't appeal to everyone. 

That Caesar salad though.....damn!"}
{"text":"Very good but has fallen off lately. Seafood platter is always my favourite choice. Fish selections sometimes limited to salmon that can fairly salty. I prefer Terra."}
{"text":"Very traditional steakhouse...making your Caesar salad from scratch right before your eyes. I particularly liked the appetizer dish they bring with garlic bread...pickles, olives, and chilli pepper. Service is excellent too. I usually order the ribeye  with a little fat on it but I've tried other cuts too that are excellent. So if you're in Thorn hill give this place a try...you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is an old-school fine dining establishment.  The decor is all dark, carved mahogany wood and back-lit stained glass windows.  Servers are dressed in dark suits.  The austere atmosphere and serious wait-staff can make guests feel uncomfortable.  If you skip dessert or don't order alcohol be prepared to feel judged. 

The steaks are tender.  The Caesar salad prepared table-side is expensive at $18.  But, at least it is meant for two.  Prices are high, as expected for this type of upscale restaurant. 

I would only recommend The Octagon for a special occasion and older clientele."}
{"text":"The Octagon is a pretty cool place if you're coming for the first time. That is to say, for a steakhouse out of the city, it's relatively high end.

I had the filet mignon, medium rare. It was without complaint, but I've also had better. I'd rank this place well above the average Keg, but considering the price range, it could use a little work. I did like how the waiter will prepare a cease salad in front of your table - that's nice.

Overall old give them a 3.75/5."}
{"text":"Great steak house. Cesar salad is made right in front of u to perfection. Steak is always cooked to perfection and service is amazing. Next time you go make sure to try a steak and sired scallops and ribs. You will be in heaven."}
{"text":"No doubt this is a classy place with your all male staff (one woman at coatcheck) and beautiful pod and decor. I found there were too many greeters at the door, but that's fine. 
Our waiter never cracked a smile but was polite. It was my wife's birthday and she really loves steak. She had the filet mignon and loved it. I had the full rack of ribs and wasn't impressed. Huge portion, but the meat was very little off the bone, and very dry and tough. The taste was good though.
The garlic mashed potatoes was lumpy!?!?!  Not impressed.
We had the coconut cream pie for dessert which was amazing.
All in all, I guess I would come back, but I would stick to the steak and not order the mash."}
{"text":"Coat check service. Friendly staff. Nice authentic Italian decor. Clean setting. Fast service.

Sat down and our server came right away to ask about drinks. Drinks came promptly after. Whenever something is needed you'll get it quite fast. 

We ordered striploin, rib steak, and prime rib regular cut. For appetizer we ordered the escargot.

Complimentary bread, pickles, olives, and some peppers offered. Pickles were well pickled and nicely sour. The peppers were nicely pickled as well and added a great kick to the food. The garlic bread was quite oily and full of garlic flavour. Tasted great and nicely crisp but can make do with less oil.

Escargot - was a bit bland and oily in my opinion. Felt heavy from the oil used to cook them but wasn't flavourful enough. 

Prime rib - meat was nice and tender. Jus was nothing special but the horseradish finished the dish. 

Rib steak - if your looking for something hearty with an umami taste, get this. Well seared and full of flavour, the rib steak was tender, seasoned well, and cooked to medium rare as we like it. Bone in always seem to taste better.

Full entrees come with a potato side and veggies. Broccoli and carrots were glazed with honey giving it some sweetness. Still a bit oily. Mashed potatoes were nothing special and more on the less impressed side. 

Overall steak was tender and flavourful so I would say that the quality is there for the price. Good for special occasions."}
{"text":"Not exactly what I expected. Food lacks flavour and seasoning. I had to salt and pepper my own rack of lamb. For the price you're paying, definitely deserve to get something that tastes better. Gave 2 stars instead of 1 just for the service. Will not recommend to friends or family."}
{"text":"Being the huge foodie I'm, I have been a faithful user of Yelp for years now. I thought maybe in the new year instead of only using yelp it's also time for me to give back.
For those who might not want to read my long review I will summarize it. I got food poisoning from not very tasty and smelly steak. Customer service was sub-par. 

Now let me get into my real thoughts and experience of the restaurant. It sadden me that my first review was about a such a horrible experience at Octagon. Me and 5 other friends decided to have a triple date there to celebrate the new year. We had a private room, the atmosphere was very antique like. All the server are older well dressed gentlemen reminds me of Barbarian Steak House downtown. But their service wasn't close to the same. Most of the time they were very confused on who ordered what. So they will bring plates of food just stand there and stare their paper and confirm orders. When I asked for gravy for my mash potato the server looked at me with the condescended look and said \"you mean au jus?\"
the Two couples ordered the fillet mignon and the rib steak to share. I order rare for my fillet mignon, but it was more like a medium rare when it came. The colour of the meat was very dark. I understand that meat are usually aged in steak house and colour isn't always bright red, but this was very dark I could barely tell if it's medium rare or medium. The colour made me feel very suspicious therefore I decided to smell it. I thought it smelled kind of funky so I asked my boyfriend to smell it also. He said its fine I'm over reacting so I decided to let it go and let him have most of it while I had half of his rib steak. The rib steak (bone in) is usually my favourite cut of steak because I like the rich flavour the bone brings out and the meat around the bone. But both of the rib steak we order wasn't very flavourful and was very very very burned. 
A few hours has gone by my stomach started to feel funny. At the same time one of the other couple who ordered the same thing as us msged me and ask how am I feeling. Don't want to get into details but the four of us spend a big part of our night in the bathroom. 
I will not recommend this steak house not only because I possible got food poisoning from it but also because the food wasn't that great. 6 of us spend $600 at this restaurant in exchange we had a terrible food experience with sub-par service. 
For Octagon, if you are reading this, please work on your quality control on your meat. Maybe consider retraining your staff also. It's a shame that you were suppose to be the only decent steak house around me but I will never visit again."}
{"text":"We visited last Saturday night.  I have wanted to come here since I was a kid, always found the building to be intriguing.  Complimentary valet parking was nice, and the interior of the restaurant is really cool.  It's so old school, but remarkable with the carved wood and stained glass everywhere.  The lights were too bright though.  Reminded me of a well lit cafeteria.  

The service was OK.  It was weird how they were either all over us (rushing us, at certain points) or they were completely...gone.  The service, after we received our mains, was all of a sudden realllllly slow.   And then it became unbearably hot in there.  It wasn't just me, all four of us were actually sweating.  It just got hotter and hotter...

I liked the relish tray.  The bread was really delicious and the pickles were nice and sharp.  I was insulted by the price of the caesar salad, so I didn't order it.  The profit margin on a caesar salad is already ridiculous, but they think they can charge $17.95 a person?  For lettuce, egg, parmesan and half an anchovy?  Ha, no.  Instead I had a caprese salad that was chincy on the cheese, had only 6 tomato slices and with 2 drops (literally) of balsamic.  I'm pretty sure it was like $20.  Probably should have just ordered the caesar..

I then had a $60 steak that was honestly delicious.  it was cooked perfectly, well seasoned and juicy.  It arrived on a plate with two ugly, gray, wrinkly mushrooms.  Before I could inquire about my potatoes, they arrived on a side plate.  Ice-cream-scooped style.  Just like a cafeteria!  I inquired as to the whereabouts of my vegetables and was informed that veg is extra $..  I said fine and they brought me 3 pieces of broccoli and 6 carrots.  They were tasty and buttery.  May have been frozen. 

Basically, this place is a rip off.  The prices are atrocious.  And believe me, I knew the prices were high before I went there and  I honestly didn't care b/c I assumed the food was good.  And while the steak was good, the rest of the food was laughable.  

This steakhouse is almost identical in menu, same relish tray, same room decor as Peter's in Markham.  Only, Peter's is such a better value and the food is WAY better.  I think I will stick with Peter's."}
{"text":"Ratings:
Food: 6/10
Drink: 8/10
Service: 6/10
Value: 5/10
Hygiene: 9/10
Aesthetics: 9.5/10

After reading the reviews and considering the type of restaurant style. I expected the service here to be exceptional. However, the restaurant was not full and yet the service was quite disappointing. 

The food was not exceptionally unique and often times over salted. There was nothing that stood out or made a good lasting impression. The beef was at least tender, but for the price, I could've gotten Wagyu steaks. The ribs appetizer we had was decent, and it was the best thing they served. The desserts were decent, but once again nothing amazing. 

They do have a decent selection of wine. The prices for the wines are also reasonable and not heavily marked up. It'd be nicer if they had a decanter though, some of their wines could definitely benefit from one. 

The service was lacking to me, the dining room had several waiters, but service was slow and pretty impolite. 

I enjoyed the dining room, the Victorian/Gothic decor was interesting and the stained glass definitely caught your attention. The building itself is unique as well. 

This restaurant is definitely a unique experience, but as a steakhouse it is utterly disappointing. I was hoping for something better, but even the keg has better steaks, and it'd be half as expensive. I don't think I would recommend eating at this place, and I doubt that I will be back here any time soon."}
{"text":"I grew up in the area. The first time I went to The Octagon restaurant, I was probably 5-6 years old. My parents went every 2 weeks for many years (until I was in my late teens). I used to LOVE The Octagon, I always recommended it to anyone who was looking for delicious ribs, steak etc. I was there 2 weeks ago for lunch. Probably my first time in 5 years. I feel like there is so much more hype to the name now then there should be for the food. 

Service - walked in and got a bit of attitude. No \"how are you doing this evening\". We were seated in a very dark part of the restaurant (you would need a flashlight to read the menu).  They like to cater to larger groups & the business lunch clientele first. We had to flag down our waiter to ask for everything - water, wine, coffee, more garlic bread, our bill etc. Surprised at the service considering the fact that there were many familiar faces - most of them have worked there for almost 20 years. 

Food - dated plating - nothing visually appealing about it. 

Steak neptune - no seasoning on the steak. Hollandaise was bland and clumpy and clearly placed under a broiler because the top of my food was brown not the colour of the hollandaise. 

French onion soup - same bowls from 20 years ago - very little onions, cheese or bread - too much pepper in the broth

Chicken neptune - zero seasoning on the chicken - hollandaise was the same clumpy cold sauce as the steak neptune. No flavour - only highlight of this dish was the amount of crab meat

Shrimp cocktail - overpriced - yes they are large BUT 5-6 years ago they were much bigger for around the same price.

Caesar salad - way TOO much cheese - they don't make them like they used to. Yes it's nice that they make it at the table, but that doesn't make it taste better - big disappointment for me overall.

Garlic bread - burnt on one side - but it was still put in a basket and brought to our table.

This place is certainly not up to par with some of the other great steakhouses (Barberian's, Hy's, Morton's etc.) They need an update out of the 80's for decor and with the amount of lights all over the place a bit brighter especially at lunch would help.

Not sure if i would go back or recommend to any family/friends anymore."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good. I enjoyed my meal very much. Thanks ribs are totally rad. Make sure you get extra rib sauce. Staff are very professional. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We went here on valentines day. The service is superb! From the complimentary valet service to the table you will be  constantly taken care off. The menu  was a limited version of their regular menu. The fillet mignon was good, the cesaer salad was average. The prime rib was served cold and it was not very tender. The sides were very limited and basic with no effort on the presentation.  The tiramisu had  a refrigerator taste. 
Generally , considering the price the food does not impress."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came here for Valentines Day dinner.
With the exception of the door man and the manager, the rest of the staff were miserable. 
Our waiter was pretentious and rude. The waitress wanted almost nothing to do with us.
I felt as though we had previously personally attacked them since our treatment was embarrassingly bad. They were treating all the other guests perfectly well from what we could see. 
At one point, when he waitress came by with our drinks, she didn't make a single sound to notify to us that she was close by. She just quickly and harshly dropped down our drinks onto the table, nearly smacking me in the face. I thought it was just me exaggerating but my fiance saw it from his side of the table and was furious but didn't want to ruin the night. 
The food itself was very good. My filet was cooked perfectly so big thumbs up to the chef. However, the presentation was depressing. No garnishing on mine or anything. Just plopped down a tiny piece of meat with a side order of garlic mash. I asked for gravy and was told this establishment doesn't give out gravy so to just enjoy it as it is. Maybe this sounds uncultured of me but WHAT THE WHAT?!
My fiance has a piece of parsley for garnishing on his that was sitting at the edge of his plate by the time the waiter had also loudly dropped it down the the table. 
Ambience was beautiful but I wish they didn't seat us in a shitty area knowing that they're not full (we got there around 10). Maybe it was a race thing? The only people with the decent seatings were all older white couples, I noticed. I also got very cold as did many of the girls that chose to wear dresses. I asked the waitress to turn up the heat and she flat out ignored me after I looked her in the eye when she was at our table. 
Overall, we had a great valentines due to the fact that we're capable of laughing and finding humour when situations like this happen. But definitely never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Wow, i'm surprised nobody has written a review for this place yet. In my opinion, this is one the best steakhouses out there I actually rate this place a 4.5/5... I took off 0.5 cause it was so dark in this restaurant that I didn't see this bump on the floor and almost tripped which would result in some embarrassment. I played it off as nothing happened though. 

The interior is very nice. Fancy decors, stain glass windows and antique style paintings give this place that old modern feel. Wine racks near the entrance gives you an idea of the variety of fine wines offered here. The lighting was a little too dark for me but I don't mind. 

Onto the food, their menu is full of delicious food choices, seafood and of course steaks to name a few. It seems that a lot of people order their Caesar salad, probably because they prepare the Caesar salad right by your table when you order it. For me, I ordered the bacon wrapped scallops and let me just say... PERFECT! Being a chef myself, scallops is something that is hard to cook perfectly and this place got it spot on. It almost just melts in your mouth. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. 

As for the main meal, how can you not order their steaks? One good thing about their steaks is that they charcoal broil them giving them that nice, smokey flavour. Generally when I order my steaks, I always order it one down of the doneness I want (ie. if I wanted medium, I ask for medium-rare) only because a lot of places never cook steak to my choice. Not with this place, I ordered medium-rare and it came exactly that way! Nice and juicy, not too salty, it was just right. My friend ordered the chicken neptune (breast of chicken topped with crabmeat, asparagus tips and hollandaise sauce) and again, delicious. I tried a piece and the chicken was cooked perfectly.

Their dessert menu offer many delicious choices ranging from Creme Brulee to Chocolate Mousse Cakes. I ordered the Tiramisu and my friend ordered the chocolate cake. Tiramisu was good and the chocolate cake was a little too sweat in my opinion. 

Highly recommend for anyone who wants to dine in a fancy restaurant and have delicious food cooked properly. Best of all... it's shaped in an octagon! How cool! Prices are quite high especially for some seafood dishes ($40.95 - single lobster tail) but I think it is well worth it. Dress code is business casual so don't be going in your sport shoes or sandals as they probably won't let you in. Hope to go here again to try their lobster."}
{"text":"Still really good and consistent after coming here since I was a boy.  Peppercorn steak and Caesar salad were still awesome.  Garlic bread still garlicky enough to kill vampires.  Much pricier than it used to be, but you get what you pay for.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service! This is so far one of the best places I've ever been."}
{"text":"Classy place. Old-school appointments and traditional steak-house fare.

I went there for lunch and service was good. Not fast, not slow, not rushed, just fine.

The onion soup was wanting. It is not a signature dish.

I had the tomato salad, which was okay -- good portion and fresh.

Also had the pepper steak, lunch portion, which was excellent. It came as a New York, very peppered, very juicy, perfectly cooked medium, with a lot of pepper sauce as well.

The garlic mash was good with the sauce, but a bit weak on its own.

Overall I'd come back for dinner. Classy place.

Lunch  less than 50 for one before tip."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I have driven past this restaurant since I was a child, so decided to celebrate my 40th birthday there. I made a reservation for 15 people, so they gave us a private room on the second floor.
First issue: no elevator. My 70 and 73 year old mom and dad had to hobble up this steep narrow staircase, with their canes...you would think with the renos after the major fire, they would add a small elevator. 
Second issue: for those that had pop, the waiter would come by and offer another. ..never telling us that there is a charge for each small glass of fountain pop... $30 on pop after a bill of $1,000...seriously?!
Third issue: the steaks were cold, but my friends and family were too polite to complain because they didn't want to ruin my night. I ordered the filet mignon that comes topped with mushrooms...there were two undercooked mushrooms thrown on the plate. The side garlic mash tasted like it came out of a box.
Word of advice. ..go to the Keg, the food is hands down much better, and a fraction of the price.
It'll be another 40 years before I even consider going back there."}
{"text":"Underwhelming at best. The steak was good (once they got the order right), and the service was pleasant. However, for overall value I found it over-priced. There are other options around at or below the price-point and better. Granted, it's been around for some time, but that doesn't necessarily indicate it's great. The ambience was more of a loud chattery restaurant versus your traditional subdued steakhouse. 
Will I go again? No. But I'm sure others will for their own reasons."}
{"text":"Vey nice service and food. Complementary valet parking was great. Most of all, steak and chicken were excellent more than expected. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very comfy Victorian style atmosphere.  Service was excellent. Every server dressed like a businessperson and they were friendly. I ordered a French onion soup, it was a little bit too salty, my hubby ordered clam chowder , it tasted creamy (good). The New York steak and peppercorn steak we order were not bad. Just the gravy sauce was a little bit too salty. The fries as a side dish was amazing and it was beyond our expectation."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner with my officemates. Service was very good. I have tried the lobster and steak and I was stuffed. Steak was cooked to perfection, I had mine medium rare. I had to mention the Caesar Salad that they prepare in front of you, it was superb. Prices are a bit steep compared to some steakhouses,  but for the service and the good food, I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Elegant and up market. Had chicken parm and filet. Food was tasty. Service wS refined. Atmosphere is classy. There is free valet parking when you arrive. With a bottle of modest wine and a dessert to share, the bill was $125. Not terrible for a classy restaurant.  Would certainly return."}
{"text":"We always enjoy dinner at the Octogon and this visit was no exception. Impeccable service from true professionals with food and ambience that is beyond reproach. Not to be missed is the Caesar salad made from scratch table side and the steaks... my filet was cooked perfectly and excellent quality as always. 

Excellent wine list with many selections that you will not find at your local LCBO. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have heard about this place with mixed reviews for years now, and we had a client coming from out of town and why not go to give it a try.

We reviews are always trying to be as positive as possible giving my opinion on what was good and bad. 

This place is priced high, it's getting old but has a high class feel which can feel sophisticated. 

Service is plenty because it was Sunday night so we were treated with a lot of attention, the starters are great: garlic toast, olives and pickles 

Here's a crap story that can turn off a lot of people but the real truth, \" there was a hair in the ceasar salad they prepared at our table, and our guests pulled it out of his mouth\" ugly truth.

The steak are priced high but very good, 
The ribs that I had were under average, not off the bone, not juicy or saucy... Disappointing  

All in all we had a unlucky night with a high bill so it's not possible to give a high rating hopefully you don't get unlucky when you go !!!!!"}
{"text":"Old school and fancy dining at its best. The meat here is top notch quality. I didn't know what to expect and I was blown away by the wait staff (totally professionalism) and the food!

I ordered the prime rib ($20, lunch) and it melted in my mouth good! Too bad they raised their prices, or I'd be back!"}
{"text":"Looking at the menu outside almost scared us away because it is really pricey but thank God we didn't. Everything was amazing and cooked spot on and we had about 3 waiters waiting on us. I ordered the veal Oscar, which I didn't know if you could order like steak (medium rare, medium etc.) but the waiter was kind enough to explain to me that it was cooked one way, but it is usually cooked medium rare-medium. My brothers got the caesar salad and it was honestly the best caesar salad I've ever had. My brother got a recommendation from yelp to try it and I'm glad he did. Definitely will order it again next time I go. The Chicken Bon River was very tender as well so that's also a good choice. 

We ordered tiramisu for dessert and I asked if they could put a candle on top for my brother and the waiter said yes without hesitation. He even came out and started singing before we did, which was awesome. The tiramisu, although a small portion, was packed with flavour and was nice and creamy.

All in all, it was definitely an experience that would make me come back. The service is fast and friendly. The food is top notch. And the atmosphere is really amazing. Oh and as for the dress code (which on the site they say they have), my brother got in with jeans and running shoes (since it was a spur of the moment thing) so I guess they're pretty lenient."}
{"text":"4.5 - I really wish Yelp implemented a half-star system. 
I was driving home from work today as usual and I noticed its big red sign. I always take that route and I have no idea why I haven't noticed it before lol. It looked like a fancy mansion so I got curious and decided to check it out.
The restaurant is beautiful. It sort of has a nice cozy home-ish feel, as well as a church-y feel. Fancy old school style. Also there is a doorman and complimentary valet parking! :) 
The garlic bread served is heavenly. I asked for a second basket because it was SO amazing. I tried not to fill my tummy with the bread before our main but couldn't stop myself!!! :(
I know this is a steakhouse but we (two people) got a seafood platter for two and two glasses of wine. The platter says market price on the menu which turned out to be $185. And it was so worth it! Such huge shrimp, scallops, crab legs, and lobster!!! Super chunky! Drool! The garlic butter to dip your food in was just perfect! I couldn't believe how big the portion was. We weren't sure whether to get an appetizer or not, and the server said the portion of the platter is big and won't disappoint, and it sure did not! We couldn't finish it so we asked for the leftover to be packed to go. The platter also came with some veggies (asparagus, zucchini, and cauliflower) as well as two sides of choice. We got rice and mashed potatoes. Fries and baked potatoes were other available side options. The sides were okay - didn't stand out as much as the seafood. As we were super full, we had to skip on dessert. 
The service was great too - attentive, friendly, and knowledgable of the wine and food. 
The bill came to almost $300 with tax and tip, which I think is a bit higher than the average prices here, but what can I do? I love seafood! A LOT of seafood! 
I definitely recommend this restaurant, especially for a special occasion. I think it is a safe spot for a fancy dinner. I know I will be back - I had a very pleasant time!"}
{"text":"What a great experience 
Service was amazing 
Food was delicious 
I had the 8oz steak as well we has escargot and oysters as apps simply delicious !!!!"}
{"text":"The is a top notch first class restaurant.  The food is exquisite, the waiters are exceptional.  I was actually in awe when I walked into the venue as the outside is not much to look at but once you step in ohhhh my. I ordered the chicken Neptune it was delicious,  chicken with stuffed crabmeat  (real crabmeat )."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the Octagon can go toe-to-toe with any other steakhouse in Canada. It owns top spot in the T.O. scene and remains respectable going up against any steakhouse in New York, Vegas or Chicago. 

Decor is...oak. Lots of oak. Stained glass and leather finish it off. It is old school steakhouse. Service too is old school. The boys there know their stuff, and they are unapologetic about not being there to entertain you. They know their job and it is to deliver what counts...steak.

The Caesar salad matches the decor...old school. Table side preparation in an aged wooden bowl, Greek oil, fresh egg yolk, bacon, anchovy and enough garlic to ward off any evil spirit. Don't pass up the opportunity. 

The garlic bread is...perfect. Always perfect and the only downside is it is so good you have to be very careful not to kill your appetite ahead of the meal. Greek olives, pickled peppers and pickle spears round out the complimentary apps.

The steak. This is why you came. Savour it. 

If you have room left for desert you are a better man than I will ever be. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I dined here January 10th for a birthday and it was divine. We ordered the table side ceaser salad, steak Neptune & espresso/Irish coffee. 

Where do I start? The actual restaurant is in the shape of an octagon (hence the name) and has a very romantic ambiance to it. Chandeliers, statues, stained glass, lanterns on the table, dark & cherry stained wood - it was beautiful. You have no option but to use the complimentary valet and coat check. I admit, it was a nice touch, although I'm sure if you don't want you coat checked you can refuse.

When you're seated, water, fresh garlic bread and an appy tray is placed in front of you, on the house. Pickles, olives and pickled peppers - yum. The garlic bread is served warm with fresh pieces of minced garlic spread all over. The ceaser salad (as I'm sure you've read) is unlike any other. It's made in a large wooden bowl right beside you by your server. The ceaser dressing had just enough garlic and flavour, it wasn't overpowering at all - if you've been reading any of my reviews, you know I'm all for the spicy ceaser dressing. The steak... how do I even capture it's beauty in words? The steak Neptune is a 8oz filet mignon topped with crab, asparagus and hollandaise sauce with your choice of side. It's served with three mushrooms as well. I asked for the sauce on the side and was amazed at how much REAL crab is actually placed on the steak. It must have been 5-6 legs, honestly. Along with the three crunchy asparagus spears, it was heavenly. Finally, the dessert. The espresso was good, nothing to rant and rave about but the Irish coffee is where it's at! Flames, fresh whipped cream, toasty coffee... mmm, mmm, good! 

In total, our bill came to $215, tip and tax included. The ceaser was $15/person, steak $50/each (we both got the Neptune), dessert was $15 total I believe and wine/beer was about $20-$25.

Jim & Tom helped us out that evening and made the experience great. When we asked for butter and more water, they came like 'that' *snaps finger*. It felt like they just waited for you request; they were at your beckoning call.

If you're on the fence about going, please just do it. It will be worth it and you will regret nothing. After reading some of the reviews, I was worried I'd feel rushed. That certainly was not the case.

My one and only gripe is the lack of female servers here. The only female I saw employed on a Saturday night was the lady at coat check."}
{"text":"This restaurant is over the top amazing! The service and quality of the food are impeccable. Great place to celebrate a special occasion with family and friends. Order the ribeye steak medium along with the Caesar salad.....you will love it! If you have room for dessert I highly recommend the coconut cream pie. 
They are also noteworthy for their attractive interiors and sophisticated ambiance."}
{"text":"What a great steakhouse! We went there on Sat evening and I had french onion soup, escargot, and petite filet mignon. Everything was delicious and the service was quick and efficient. The place was full, so I was a bit concerned that my meat will be overdone. Well, the steak was exactly medium-rare done to perfection. Unfortunately I didn't have space left for desert, their creme brulee looked delicious, so hopefully next time :)"}
{"text":"Probably closer to 3.5, but we don't get those yet. The dated decor is matched by a somewhat dated menu, but you know what you're coming here for. There's no question that the service level is very, very high, but the food felt a little uninspired - even for a steakhouse. I think for the price tag you'll probably have a better steak in the city. But if you insist on staying uptown, your hands are tied."}
{"text":"The service was great and it's a nice restaurant. We ordered a prime rib rare. Super good."}
{"text":"This place is one of the legendary steak houses of the GTA. In itself, that makes the Octagon very much worth visiting, with old school service that makes every visit memorable. I fully enjoyed the food served, yet given the price, it fell a bit short of my expectations."}
{"text":"I rated 3 stars because i expected more from an upscale steakhouse with this price point. The food is really good in general. Complimentary garlic bread is crisp which i really enjoyed. The platter came with pickle, olives, and pepper are unusual compared to other steakhouses but also very great to munch on. We shared the escargot, caprese salad and the porterhouse (24oz). The escargot is bland, nothing special. I actually like the keg's escargot more because it is way more flavourful. The caprese salad is very average as well. Dressing is not fully coated and again, $18 make me i think it'd be more special. The Porterhouse is very good. It came medium rare just how i asked and the meat is soft, definitely not chewy at all. Service wise is professional but not warm and welcoming. Theres no wine list so the server had to list it out for me but he was in a rush when listing it so i couldn't catch anything so i just picked whatever i heard. Later on when food came out he said next time he would not be able allow us to share the steak because policy is one entree per person. We understand that but the way he explained was not really empathetic and That kinda ruined our mood too because we are those people who never stingy with paying for food and 24oz steak is really big for both of us. Whenever we eat out we always get 8 or 10 oz. And the porterhouse is something i always wanna try so I picked that on the menu.  Plus we ordered 3 drinks, and 2 appetizers so i dont think we were being cheap.  Afterall it was a great classic steak house with great service but id rather be at jacobs, barberian, Ruth chris or even the Keg."}
{"text":"Amazing place

Prices obviously on the high end. 

Handmade Caesar salad at your table is delicious (always get it when I go)

Steaks--- amazing. Melts in mouth. Always right seer 

Wine - great selection. From high to low prices 

End of day it's a nice treat once or twice a year."}
{"text":"It's a lovely old school type steakhouse with dark wood paneling and stained glass. Service is good, we did feel a bit rushed- we ordered appetizers and entrees and we had all our food by the 45 minute mark. We had the crab cakes which were good and the clam chowder which was quite thick and had that almost gelatinous quality when it cooled down a little- not a fan. You're not allowed to share entrees- my sister and I were going to split the lamb chops but ended up ordering from the lighter menu instead. I had the salmon and she had the chicken Parmesan which were okay, we don't eat beef. Our mother had the steak- we went there for her birthday and she loves steak, and she said it was delicious. Overall underwhelming experience for quite an expensive meal."}
{"text":"Great steak house! I ordered a 8oz filet mignon medium rare. It was cooked to perfection and no issues cutting through the meat. 
Service is impeccable as well. Our water and wine was always refilled without disruption."}
{"text":"Excellent steaks cooked just right and the Caesar salad made at your table best in thornhill .. Must have the shrimp cocktail just awesome and the ambiance is amazing love the ties and old fashioned style !"}
{"text":"My BF and sister went here about 1 year ago and meant to write the review, so here it is now. I had made reservations (thankfully - because the place was packed!! in February) and people waiting at the door. I LOVE the old-school 'fat bastard' element about this place. The service is top notch (if not slightly snooty) for sure and I'm a sucker for it. (Def. not Hipster vibe) Old wood beams, some stained glass.. as I said, tres old school. We had the table-side Caesar, which was good, but a little too much of the white stems. Since we were pretty full from that, we ordered steaks on the smaller side.  The steaks, I'd give a 7/10. The pickle plate and bread that comes to the table are terribly sad.  Actually, with the prices as they are here, I would really expect VERY good bread.  We received, cold, stale garlic bread.  I think that was the big downfall of our meal (since bf loves bread) and at Smith Bros and Keg have AMAZING warm bread.
Just because I love the old school service, I would come back, order a larger steak (hoping it's cooked better than the smaller ones we had).  
We all had creme brule for dessert and it was Yum :)"}
{"text":"Service is top notch in here, but the quality in my opinion is not there if you add all factors in (ambiance, price, service)
The lack of choices for appetizers and mains, makes it a little hard to find something specific you might be in for. They could enlarge their menu selections, and add few items.

I have visited it a couple of times, but it wouldn't be something that I would repeat or recommend.

Their steaks are good, mediocre, but definitely not the best in the GTA
I've tried the fillet, and the pepper corn steak, not bad but not the best."}
{"text":"Great old school steak house. Older traditional waiters standing on the outskirts reacting to your slightest raised eyebrow. I hate asking for more water or being disturbed when its actually being topped up...not here. The staff know what they are doing at the Octagon.
Shrimp cocktail, the way it should be. The made at your table ceasar salad you'll find no better. The steak done the way you ask. 
Old school, not really any flare - except for the made at your table ceasar salad and pepper corn sauce but if that's that you want. The Octagon does nothing wrong"}
{"text":"The Greek salad tonight was disappointing, the lettuce somewhat wilted. They piled the feta on, maybe to hide the second class lettuce? 
We both ordered the 6 oz New York strip steak from the \"lighter menu selections\". Despite the size it was very good."}
{"text":"Don't listen to anyone else's review but mine. The Octagon ruined my birthday with its salty Oyster Rockefeller appetizers and uninspired, terribly mediocre steak. Also the prime rib tasted like grocery store bought roast beef. The pickles were an abomination and made me cry tears for my grandchildren. If you like feeling trapped in a windowless setting with a very underwhelming experience feel free to drop over $200."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this steakhouse and finally has the opportunity to do so. So first thing is that his place is very old school, reminds us of the Old Scott House.  Waiters are dressed up formally and very friendly.  We had a very nice waiter but he was quiet busy so we had to wait longer than we expected to get our orders taken.  I opted to go with the Fish Almondine (I know who goes to a steakhouse and orders fish right?!). I wasn't feeling like beef so wanted to try something new.  It was quite plain, fish with almonds spread over it.  My dinner companions had prime rib and they made a good choice as it was a big portion, juicy and tasty.  The garlic bread is addictive and the table side Ceasar was very good but croutons underwhelming.  We ordered desserts and they were very frozen and probably something that is not made in house.  I'm happy I experienced it however will probably not be back.  If you go, order Caesar salad and steak."}
