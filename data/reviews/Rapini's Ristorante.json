{"text":"I have gone to this restaurant 4 years ago and did not like it then and i still dont like now. Now I know why i havent been back since my last experience, especially after last nights dinner???we were greeted and seated right away last night by a friendly, charismatic gentelman (i think it was the owner). Our waiter took the drink orders to start and i guess they were short staffed or Under staffed so the owner took our orders shortly there after stated he would have to put our orders in if not the restaurant will get busy and i will take much longer to recieve our food (he wasnt kidding) it took 40 minutes to recieve our food, the calamri (fried) were over cooked, poor quality and cold, the shrimp diablblo, was elasticy, over cooked and cold. Yet we didnt complain. 45 mintues later we finally recieved our entrees, everyone ate there\"s but mine,  a supposed 10 oz newyork steak, was burnt to crisp, dry and cold, i cut into it and there was a large bright red vien in it, it was poor quality meat and disgusting. that was the last straw(mind you that entree was $28 dollars), i called the owner over and showed it to him, he agreed and apologized and asked if I wanted another entree on the house,  i had seen enough from this mockery of an eating establishment and stated i wanted nothing else. Upon glazing into the kitchen which was visible from my seat, there were two young adults inn the kitchen, with baseball hats positioned backwards, with dirty uniforms on. Maybe this is why the food sucked and was off. whatever it was the restaurant was full of people (who apparently have no taste, when it comes to Italian fine dining) and i dont know how the manage to keep the door open. Lastly, we were looking for our waiter who was no where to be found, so we asked for the bill by the hostess (owners wife), she stated i will find your waiter and under her breath stated `that`s not my job!`` i was so blatent and she looked miserable. I would be to if i was running a poor quality restaurant with inexperienced wait and kitchen staff. The highlight of the night the Male owners charm the low light everything else.  1 out of 10 maybe. Still looking for a good Italian restaurant in Brampton, on the brighterside Woodbridge is 15 minutes away via 407, and they got a bunch of good Ã€UTHENTIC`Italian restaurants......"}

{"text":"We had Mother's Day reservations (Highly recommend a reservation at any time). Evie greeted me at the door and even though I had to wait to be assisted, I didn't feel like I was being ignored or \"just hanging around\" and waiting (and waiting and waiting). Evie was fast and efficent and it was a surprise that a front-door hostess would take the time to introduce themselves by name - thats a good customer relation plus on my side! It already feels intimate.
Mother's Day (probably Father's Day, Valentines Day and New Years Eve) has a set meu and a flat rate price. $35 for an appetizer (soup or salad - none of which is pre-packaged or pre-prepared - very fresh ingredients), a choice of about 15 entrees (beef, chicken, pork and seafood) and they loose one star because there was no vegetarian option. However our waiter came to the rescue and checked with the kitchen and they offered manicotta (which my daughter said was very good). Our server, John, tried to accommodate us all and I think did a wonderful job. He did warn us at the start of the evening that there were certain items they were gettng low on, which made some of our choices easier (and harder). 
All the food we had was very good. None of it felt pre-processed at all. 
Yes, I'd go again, but not at the fixed price/menu. My husband was disappointed in that, mostly because we weren't notfied in advance when we made the reservation nor online when checking the menu (Online did state \"Special Mother's Day Menu\", but not the items or cost). At $35 a person for 6 people, well, it was a little too rich for our poor Brampton pockets. But we'll definately be back, just the two of us, for our next special occassion."}
