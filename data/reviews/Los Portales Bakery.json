{"text":"Little unassuming, in fact hard to find and a bit sketchy, location behind another restaurant in North Las Vegas - but the torta I had was really good. We were actually headed to another torta place a couple doors down that I hear is wonderful but the other place was remodeling and we were told that this place was good, and it was. I had the Torta Pierna - some sort of shredded pork (I think)with lettuce and tomato and a red sauce, I am sure I am not doing the explanation justice. The only complaint was service was really, really slow and there was only one other group in the place. But two sandwiches and a drink for $12 - not bad. Also, tried the carne asada torta and it was okay but nothing memorable. I would go for the pierna over the carne asada. This place was a bakery too, I didn't try anything but they had a decent selection of Mexican pastries and there were quite a few customers for the bakery why we were waiting. So in closing, I would go hear again if I felt like a torta but I still must try the place a couple doors down to the east of this location."}
{"text":"What an amazing place!!!! Great food and great service! My family and I have been coming here for years and the quality of the food never disappoints. The cakes and pastries are always fresh and truly represent Mexican desserts. Great restaurant/bakery!"}
{"text":"I like lots of bread donuts and all that other good stuff that's not so good for you but you only live once so what the hell live like theres no tomorrow and work twice as hard to make up for it when it comes so this place was awesome definitely going back"}
{"text":"I love this hole in the wall, the gorditas are delicious, and the bread is incredibly soft as if they sold their souls to the devil for the soft perfection. They also have menudo err'day, I've got to go back and try that."}
{"text":"The cake we bought here was divine. Because of the language barrier, I have no idea its name but it had a chocolate cake layer and a white cake layer with a cheesecake in the middle. Moist and unbelievable... our friends we brought this to their dinner party were highly impressed and new fans of this bakery."}
{"text":"Really good tasting cakes, their signature cake the portales cake is the best tasting one. They also have 3 leches which is also really good. Come here if you want a real Mexican tasting cake !  Location is kinda ugly but don't judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"A very authentic feeling to Mexico.  The food is from scratch and everything its just so delicious!!!!! Especially the sweet guayaba bread"}
{"text":"Something about North Las Vegas makes me crave pan dulce... Luckily, a quick Yelp search pointed me in the direction of Los Portales. It's hidden behind some other buildings, and the outside appearance sure isn't much to look at. The lack of windows had me wondering if I was entering a 'portal' to hell, or some tasty baked goods. I trusted my Yelp friend Vanessa's review and recommendation of jalapeño cream cheese bolillos, and discovered the latter.   I didn't see any prices listed for the pan dulce, but they were very inexpensive. I selected four pieces, including one of those soft, chewy bolillos stuffed with cream cheese and jalapeños, and paid less than $3 total. The guava empanada and caramelized pastry that resembled an oreja were good, too. A full menu of Mexican fare is served here, and with so many prices below the $5 mark, Los Portales may deserve consideration in the cheap eats category.  Vaya con Dios."}
{"text":"The menudo and the Gorditas are amazing. I can't forget el pan dulce. This is truly a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's definitely a hole-in-the-wall by most standards, but the best one you'll find!!   They have the BEST menudo for those of us whose mom refuses to smell up the house just to cook it. I have actually seen people come in with a pot for them to fill up and take home! . They sell red and white menudo (red being more popular) and they give you a choice of adding grano and pata.   Their gorditas de chicharron are simply amazing! You get to choose gorditas de maiz or harina. I didn't even know gorditas de harina was even option until this place and now I will never get maiz.   Their pan dulce is also better than anything you'll find in a store."}
{"text":"First of all be very careful driving through the crater infested parking lot around the back entrance; it could spell disaster especially if your car is lowered like mine.   This outdated dump was surprisingly busy when I arrived and the nice lady behind the counter did not know one lick of English. Lmfao!! I was reluctant to order but I did my best not to allow my pessimistic ways to prevail.   I ordered some sort of mini cheese croissant which was alright, nothing special. Next I ordered a carne asada burrito that took forever to come out and when it did it was a terrible tasting disaster. The meat was tough and every bite was filled with impossible to chew tendon. At least the diet 7up part of my meal was good.   This place is in serious need of an overhaul. I won't be back in any lifetime. Friends, you've been warned."}
{"text":"Fue a pedir un pastel para el cumpleaños de mi niña y la vieja que estava trabajando se porto súper culera!!!, casi le molestaba las preguntas que le asíamos, muy déspota no nos quiso ayudar bien ni salió de atrás del counter. Ya via ablado con blanca Dias antes y me dijo el precio y todo muy hamable ella pero ni pendeja voy a gastar mi dinero en un lugar que no save atender sus clientes! Fue porque eran muy recomendados pero no gasten su tiempo ni dinero aquí , van a pasar enojos!!!! ZERO ESTRELLAS!!"}
{"text":"The menudo here is awesome just like mom's makes, and prices are dirt cheap. It's a bakery so you get fresh bread to dip in the broth for just 50 cents more. You get all the condiments oregano,chopped onions,limes, and chile if you want it spicier. The outside looks like a bland brick bldg, but don't judge a book by its cover, there's great mexican food inside."}
{"text":"Best tres leches cake in las vegas! The owner is very friendly and the prices are very reasonable too. I have also tried the mexican cheeseburger and it was delicious! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Supper good food. I went 3 times last week. They have a ton of selection. The bread that has cream cheese and ham was so so so so good. Ummmmmm"}
{"text":"Love this place, all their food is good I especially love their cakes and gorditas  cake goes by the slice as well perfect for that occasional craving!"}
{"text":"I needed a tres leches cake in a hurry. Did a Google search and found this place. They had cakes ready and were reasonably priced. The cake was a hit at my office! Everyone wanted to know where I got the cake from. Will definitely try them again."}
{"text":"I love this place. The menudo is ssoo good. The pan dulce is delicious and the bolillo with jalapeños  is AMAZING! !!Staff is very nice as well ."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall is AMAZING! Friendly staff that always remembers you. The bread is always fresh and the food is delicious. Definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I absolutely love everything the bread the gorditas  And the best menudo i have ever had besides my moms its so good with the birote dorado yummy!!! I always come her its a jewel!!"}
{"text":"30 minutes wait for the food to be ready when there is barley any people inside? Yeah never coming back. Food was okay nothing too extraordinary. If you don't have alot of time to wait on food your best bet is to go down the street to the Pollo Loco."}
{"text":"This is literally a hidden gem for Mexican food. My friend is from Durango and told me about this restaurant. I had a HUGE serving of pozole and ate every last drop. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Give me cake. Well my dads birthday was coming up and I needed to find a really good cake for him, because he is diabetic. I have to make sure I care of my pops.   I came here as a referral from another friend that has been here before. They can make any cake you like, the best part is that they actually freshly bake your cake to you liking sugar free.. (can you say awesome) The only thing required is a deposit, a % of the cakes value, and a 1 weeks notice for sugar free because they order the ingredients.  The cake itself was really good I couldn't tell to much that it was in fact sugar free, it was moist and full of flavor. Not only that my pops really enjoyed it.   I am so glad that there are bakeries that bake sugar free. This would be one of them. The location of this place is a little weird. On Las Vegas Blvd you will make a left on Daley st and enter the first parking lot to your right.   The best part about this place is they sell fresh sweet (Mexican) bread, and they have some of the best stuffed bolios with cheese and jalapeños. Omg sooooo good."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years for the tres leches cake. It's such a simple and beautiful cake with a layer of flan compared to the other ones you find of yellow cake sitting on condensed milk. Their design skills are basic so if you are looking for a more customized cake, I would look elsewhere. But we cared more about the taste and it's been a hit at our baby showers and birthdays. There's also some Mexican pastries; however, I've never tried to order any of their meals that they cook out of the kitchen. It's definitely a hidden gem tucked away in the northeast Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"Slow to explore North Las Vegas, a situation not uncommon amongst those interested in Food locally, it was in continued pursuit of Sin City's best Pan Dulce that a drive was made to Los Portales on Saturday morning, arrival delayed by the Presidential motorcade but shelves still well-stocked a little past 11:30am.  Located at 2630 East Lake Mead Boulevard amidst a series of low-slung buildings, neither cross-street directly leading to a space with its name printed in large letters along exterior walls, those entering Los Portales will do so from a dusty lot, the young bilingual clerk offering greetings from behind one of two counters as she went about her business.  Largely Panaderia and Café but also selling a limited number of Chips plus Soft Drinks, two diners already present eating what looked like Menudo or Pozole plus an enormous Burrito, it was after taking a look at perhaps two dozen items baked on-site that six were selected, the staff's unwillingness to cut one of several whole Tres Leches Cakes leading to a late addition in the form of a Triple Layer Slice.  Asking to eat the Cake at Los Portales while saving additional items for later, the young lady nonetheless placing a wedge in plastic and bagging it with a fork and napkins, it was after taking a seat amongst tables still littered with plates from prior guests that bites were taken first of each section separate and then as a whole, the Cheesecake layer especially good but all three in one mouthful definitely best as each was divided by a rich ribbon of Chocolate.  Never unsurprised by the low-cost of Mexican Bakeries, no prices listed but a total cost of $6.50 all that was requested, it was approximately two hours later that the rest of the lot was investigated, the Concha light and fluffy with the Sugar on top adhering better than many while both an undersized \"Elephant Ear\" and Tricolor Cookie were fine, though far from the best in Sin City.  Always happy to see something unexpected, a small Cookie labeled \"Flor\" not familiar from visits to other Panaderia locally or elsewhere, it was amidst a moist Cornmeal base that this item offered a puddle of sweetened Cream Cheese not unlike Custard, the subsequent two selections both offering thick Guava Jelly with the Empanada nicely caramelized on the outside but still not as good as a Pastelillo featuring Puff Pastry wrapped around a center mellowed by Cream.  THREE STARS:  More pleasant in terms of service than some local Mexican Bakeries but also a bit more limited Los Portales warrants a look if one is in the area, a \"special trip\" perhaps advisable for those who like Cream-based Pan Dulce."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gem when it comes to cakes and they make Gorditas a Mexican dish a must have , they have Mexican sweet, Jalapeño cheese stuff bread ,different types of bake not pretty but delicious cookies...and the cakes are super delicious and very inexpensive... is super hidden but boy ...the best ....trust me ..."}
{"text":"I've been getting my cakes here  For five years straight love 3 leches! It's my fave. This place feels like home from the food all the way into the bakery. (:"}
