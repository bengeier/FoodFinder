{"text":"What a good little Mexican restaurant! 

I had almost given up on finding even half-way decent Mexican food in the west valley. After reading the Yelp reviews, hubs and I decided to give Don Pancho a try on a recent Saturday afternoon.

We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful cashier. You order at the counter and then the food is then delivered to your table. She explained the menu well, made great suggestions and helped us feel right at home. Hubby played it safer with an enchilada combo, I opted for the recommended #12 Combo of a soft corn taco filled with asada, a sopa with carnitas and a maiz quesadilla with pork al carbon, all served up with rice and beans and a giant fountain drink or fresca or horchata for $9.99 (also included corn chips drizzled with beans and served with their red salsa)! What a fantastic deal! 

My food was delicious. Well prepared, fresh ingredients, seasoned just right. the salsa bar was full of yummy salsas and condiments which were just right for topping off my big happy plate of Mexican goodness. This is simple home food done right. Several times friendly employees checked in with us to see how we were doing. 

The best adjective I have for Don Pancho is happy. And we'll be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! We've been back a couple times and each time has been great. We highly recommend this Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been in AZ for 5 years now.  Came from CA where I have my favorite Mexican places.  We've tried many places out here and couldn't find one to compare.  After reading great reviews on Don Pancho, I decided to try it.  LOVED IT!  Super friendly, there is always somebody cleaning up, fairly fast service even when it's busy, and great prices.  Absolutely love their chips, beans, salsa that is complementary served.  I took my sister and her family.  They went back the very next day with our mom.  My mom has introduced the place to others at her church.  Great place and I will continue to spread the word."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food in the West Valley.  Everything was fabulous.  Try the Chile Verde!  The staff were so friendly and helpful.  We will be back many times!"}
{"text":"The best carne asada tacos. Food never disappoints. Friendly workers. Great customer service."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat Mexican food..reminds me of my mother s cooking. Good service and nice staff."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Mexican food. Customer service was excellent! I am gluten free and the even pan-fried my quesadilla for me and told me to call in next time for the new batch of oil and they would prepare the chips for me ahead of time. If they had a separate fryer for gluten free, I would have given 5 stars. We will be back :-)"}
{"text":"Do not go to this restaurant! I bought 4 ceviche tostadas for 15 dollars and they charged me 150 dollars.  After that they charged me 15 dollars more because they made a wrong calculation the first time.  

Don Poncho pretended to give me a refund electronically and gave me a fake receipt.  When I checked my balanced I was missing 150+ dollars from my checking account.  Called Don Poncho and told me that he did not know how to work the system and refused to give me back my money.  He never acknowledge that I was going to be missing 150 dollars from my checking account and was very reluctant to admit it and NEVER EVER APOLIGIZED.  I was charged an overdraft fee from my bank and Mr. Poncho said that was not his problema. Very RUDE. 
He pretended not to know what was going on and told me to go ahead and call the police. 


He told me to bring back my checking card so he could deduct another 150 dollars from my own account which made no sense to me whatsoever. He said he did not want to refund me on the spot and this is what business usually do, give you a refund.  He also refused to refund me the 15 dollars for the tostadas even though I wasted 5 hours trying to get my money back and I still do not have it. 

DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fui a desayunar con mi esposo, andábamos visitando Phoenix y queriamos desayuno mexicano, vimos este lugar en Yelp con buenos puntos y fuimos. Es unlugar sencillo, económico, la comida estaba buena"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food we have ever had.  Very friendly,  explained the menu and fast service.  Salsa bar and chips were excellent.  The rice pudding was outstanding.  Very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Good, cheap Mexican.  No menu item over $10.  Enchilada plate (8.95 with beverage) was good.  No frills kinda place."}
{"text":"this place is awesome,i had the combination plate and had items i never had before.not like a regular restaurant,you order at the counter and they bring it to you and theres no alcohol.very clean and people are friendly,worth giving it a try."}
{"text":"Love this place, definitely have to try the menudo if you never have, or the posole. You will not be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Don Pancho's is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the entire Phoenix area.

The customer service is terrific.  The family that runs this establishment is always so kind and welcoming.

I always want to try something different when I come in, but I am hooked on the carne asada sopes!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype!  The comida at Don Panchos is the best in the west (side of town). Temper your expectations, though.  This is not fine dining, just real deal home-style Mexican food.

The tacos are the star attraction here, in my opinion. Street style, with loads of meat, cabbage, cilantro, & onion.  They are an absolute bargain for the quality you get.  The quesadilla de maiz are the bomb.  Burritos are mighty tasty, though could be a bit bigger.  If you order the delicious green chile plate, be prepared for some of the best home made corn tortillas you'll ever have.  

The meats here are all fabulous, but the carne asada deserves special mention.  It's very lean, perfectly seasoned, and is cooked over an open flame to impart a kiss of smokiness.  Easily my favorite carne asada of all time.  In taco form?  Wow...just wow.

Not to be over-shadowed, they have an excellent salsa bar.  The red chile is spicy with a nice saltiness. The green chile is smoky and has a nice kick.  But here is the pro tip: their best salsa is kept in the kitchen and is served with the complimentary chips. This stuff is amazing with a hint of cilantro.

The atmosphere is clean and the service is always friendly.  The first few times we ate here was take out.  The first time we ate in the restaurant, Jose (the proprietor) was so nice & gave us free arroz con leche!

If you're in the west valley and crave some seriously good carne asada tacos, you can't do better than Don Panchos!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. I had the best meal there. It was a wonderful carne asada with a great flame grilled taste. It was very juicy and tasted just so delicious! I'm a huge fan of grilled food so even the grilled jalapeno was a delight. The people were so friendly and kind. The man at the counter suggested a couple of different items, and gave us a basket of chips with dip to eat while waiting for the take out. They also have fantastic sauces! It was really difficult to figure out which we liked the best. If made to choose, it was the roasted salsa verde. But all of them were fabulous. This really is the best Mexican food in Goodyear or in the entire area. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants very real, very lovingly prepared food. The restaurant itself is very, very small and we were there for take out. But there are more things that look scrumptious on the menu and hope to be back very, very soon."}
{"text":"Maybe it's a bit of emotional eating when I come here but the food is tasty!  If u want Mexican food Taco Bell style this place is not it. It authentic southern Mexican food. You have to try their quesadillas or tacos de Maiz (corn) ..so good! Especially the carne asada...it's so good that if a piece falls of my place , the three second rule always applies. It's small inside and a lil dated; study the menu because its a bit overwhelming but the hospitality from the owners makes up for it and adds to the old nana and tata's house feel. Just want to hug 'em both!

Dress: Anything goes here. 

P.s. Area can be a lil sketchy at night and they close early."}
{"text":"Que Deliciosa! The locals already know about Don Pancho's judging by the number of people eating lunch on a Wednesday. We were just visiting Phoenix and looking for a place to have lunch before heading to the airport. We were so fortunate to find this little gem! Great salsa bar with several delicious salsas and hot carrots. My husband had soft tacos. The tacos were small, tender homemade tortillas filled with wonderful fresh ingredients: shredded beef done perfectly, chopped onions, cilantro, and lettuce. Really light and tasty. I had the crisp tacos with beans and rice. I'm going to be wanting to stop in again whenever I'm in the Phoenix area to have some more!"}
{"text":"So bomb.... Real Mexican food, very nice ppl work there, makes you feel very welcomed!! The food is so good and fresh!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to a high \"Yelpage\" factor/rating we went to Don Pancho on a Saturday mid afternoon.  We were immediately greeted by great aromas and a very charming and amiable fellow who turned  out to the Nephew of the owner(s).  He gave us a great overview of the menu and exuded pride in what their food consists of and how it is prepared.  They have a great salsa bar and their chips are as good as any we have had.  All of our food was excellent and was brought out to all four of us at pretty much the same time.   What a great place!  We will be frequently returning."}
{"text":"My wife and I are from San Antonio, TX and eat our fair share of Mexican food. Don Pancho's exceeded expectations. I highly recommend the chicken enchiladas and the flautas. Both were delicious entrees. The staff was very friendly too. We look forward to returning again."}
{"text":"Great food, and awesome service. Loved it. I go there every weekend with my family and friends."}
{"text":"Major disappointment. When I went to this place 5 months ago, they had all 5 stars for every post. I was excited to find a new restaurant and cancelled a trip to my favorite restaurant.

It is more like a fast food / Federico's set up. Service was okay, food was marginal."}
{"text":"Don Panchos is the *best* authentic Mexican food in the west valley! The service is always amazing and the vibe of this place makes for a great experience. They make the best carne asada eggs & potatoes, carne asada nachos, and chilaquiles! Everything here is delicious"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful, and is my go-to restaurant for Mexican food.

Where to start? Free chips and salsa, wonderful food, totally affordable (my FILs jaw dropped when he realized we paid less than $20 for our table), lovely welcoming atmosphere... the list goes on.

We have eaten here on many occasions, and they are always busy - because they are very good at what they do.
Shredded beef enchiladas with rice,beans and a drink for $6... unbeatable for lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great variety and excellent prices! The managers/owners are very friendly, and happily accommodated my picky toddler. I was also impressed with the clean restrooms. Definitely will return soon!"}
{"text":"Never come eat here again rude staff small portions dirty location they brought out our meal and said the tortillas were on there way never got them So disappointed with thistestaurant Ill never take my family there again"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!!! 10 stars if I could! Delicious, authentic and flavorful food. Service was a little longer than avg first thing in the morning....but I watched it pick up to speed as more people came in. We had menudo, chorizo, chilaquiles. Their chips are served with a sprinkle of beans and crumbled cheese. Salsa bar has something for everyone..green red...you choose.  Bomb.com. Chilaquiles were not soggy!!! First time here and it did not disappoint. Owners tended the tables as needed and made you feel like you were welcome. I am beyond excited to finally have some down home cooking that tastes like your mamas/grandmas kitchen. I cannot wait to try more off the menu. Give it a try!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is as close to Mexican home cooking as you're gonna get! Prices are affordable too!"}
{"text":"Visiting from south texas and wanting some home comfort food. This place is fantastic! Lunch plates were well served and food was delicious!  We loved the salsa bar. The best plate was the Chile relleno stuffed with queso fresco and topped with red salsa. Will definitely be returning when visiting this beautiful state!"}
{"text":"Really great food and the pricing is hard to beat. Wasn't busy at lunch on a Wednesday, so seating was plentiful and food arrived quickly."}
{"text":"If i could have left 0 stars i would have.  Steak for tacos and torta tasted and were burnt and was probably left on griddle for too long.  Were the worst steak tacos and torta we've ever had.  Chicken quesadillas were dripping in grease and made 1 in our party sick to their stomach.  Not sure how this place gets any positive reviews!  I was looking forward to going but will never go back."}
{"text":"This is such great Mexican food. When I walked in and the guy told me all about the menus and had me taste the carne asada and the green and red sauces. We ordered to go and had the Pastor plate and Carne asada plate steak style (not chopped). I had to try all the salsas too. They are all so good. I'm in love with the green sauce with bits of jalapeno and cilantro. The carne was grilled which added so much flavor and depth. The carne was a skirt steak and was tender and delicious. The Pastor was very tender.and I almost wished I gotten that! The corn tortilla are so good. They actually zmell and taste like corn.  They're not the thin flavorless ones most places steam. These were toasted too. The jalapenos that come with the meal are hot but so good!  They are fresh and whole.They added a fresh slice of avocado and a salad with cooked and raw onions so that it's a real plate. Some places don't even give you lettuce and tomato on plates anymore.. The only criticisms we had were the beans were very watery although tasted very good. The rice was also somewhat bland. But the service and overall meal were just wonderful. If they added some cumin to the rice, lime powder and sea salt to their chips and had thicker beans, it would be heaven! This is definitely a new go-to place for us."}
{"text":"From out of town and we loved the traditional food
Delicious and home made 
I had the carne asada nachos ( delicious)
We found this place from Yelp and it did not disappoint 
We totally recommend for authentic Mexican food
ENJOY !!"}
{"text":"Tried 3 different burritos and a taco plate to go and was not impressed.  First visit I ordered a chorizo breakfast burrito and could not believe that they charged me for a 1 inch diameter burrito.  Thought I'd give them a second chance and ordered a carne asada, california burrito and a taco combination plate.  Dissapointing serving sizes and value is reason for my low review.  Flavor was ok but can't recommend when a taco plate had two tablespoons of rice and beans and the burritos are tiny."}
{"text":"So glad we stopped!! Amazing authentic Mexican food! The Lengua tacos were delicious! The chips with beans on them...amazing. So friendly and food is honestly amazing!!! FIVE STAR The cutest waitress, Caprotada, was amazing!!! Adorable"}
{"text":"It was good for the price but the nachos were dry and over cooked. I had the enchilada dinner it's definitely California Mexican style not a lot of taste compared to Texmex. Overall the value was good I definitely would recommend this place if you like California style Mexican food."}
{"text":"great service with great attitude and food and i love the chili verde never had a problem always good when we go"}
{"text":"Try the sampler plate... all meats perfectly seasoned, and the bean and rice are also good.  The tacos are my favorite, but the quesadilla de maiz was really good and crunchy.  Salsas are all fresh and tasty, my fav was the green salsa with red onion and the red one was spicy with flavor .  Service is awesome."}
{"text":"It is, perhaps, unfair to compose a review, in which you compare one restaurant to another.  What does the food and quality of one restaurant have to do with another?  But, in this case, given that the competing restaurant (Señor Taco) is nearby and the same kind of place, I think it's justified making the comparison this time.

I decided one happy day after the gym, that I'd had enough of Señor Taco over and over again and remembered that I had been at Don Pancho's once before and couldn't recall anything negative about it.  So, I figured I'd give it another try.  While not located in the best part of Avondale, it's pretty safe going there during the day.  The inside is decently spacious and the staff is certainly friendly enough; but it didn't take me long to have issues.  First, it was 112F out that day ... and maybe close to mid-80s or more inside.  Yes, they have a/c; but they rely more on the ceiling fans, which, while keeping the place pleasantly cool-ish enough, is hardly comfortable.  I can only imagine what the poor people in the kitchen were going through.  Decor in the place is nice (especially the tilework and art) and the place has an airy and open feel about it (though there are only, maybe, 8 tables or so).

Complaint Number One was the fountain drinks, which, at $2.25 for a large, is far from cheap, but refills from a fountain cost another 99 cents?!?  Truly, I realize restaurants have to make money, too; but the syrup for a soda fountain is hardly a big expenditure and when you consider most restaurants offer free refills, this comes across as a bit tacky.

I ordered two helpings of ceviche (with tostada) and rather than separate the orders, they put them together in one box.  I admit, I didn't ask them to separate them; but before assuming the second person having it was dining with me, it would've been nice to ask whether I wanted them in the same box (to be fair, Señor Taco has done that, too; and I now ask them to put them in separate boxes whenever I order two ceviches).  The ceviche tasted good, but, unlike our good friend Señor Taco, they don't servie it with any kind of sauce; put one tiny lime wedge in it; and the tostadas are about the size of a DVD disk (i.e., two tostadas for two orders don't cut it).  Quantity was decent, but the fish and veggies are cut up very small and \"seem\" to have less volume than the ceviche at ... you know where.

Next, there was the fish burrito.  Señor Taco's fish burrito has a little lettuce, some rice and, I suspect, lots of mayo.  The one here had a lot of shredded lettuce, loose, short-grain rice and no sauce I could detect.  It was good, but, of course, it's the fat that gives flavor.  Also, smaller portion than at Señor Taco's on Estrella Parkway, but more expensive.  So ...

FISH BURRITO

Don Pancho:  lots of shredded lettuce; very loose, short-grain rice; not much fish; fat burrito but not very long

Señor Taco:  not much lettuce; compact, long-grain rice held together by sauce; large pieces of fish; fat and long burrito

The shrimp burrito a la diabla was also good, but I couldn't identify the sauce (and there wasn't much of it), there was much more rice and beans, a taste that, while somewhat spicy, was not what I'd call hot.  So ...

SHRIMP BURRITO A LA DIABLA

Don Pancho:  mild and unidentifiable sauce; not much shrimp; lots of rice and beans; fat, but short, burrito

Señor Taco:  very spicy and hot sauce; possibly some mayo or other cream sauce; lots of shrimp, fat and long

So far, Señor Taco was beating this place hands down.  I did like that Don Pancho had fresh cucumbers at the salsa stand, though, again, the salsa stand at Señor Taco's is more extensive.

So, to sum up:

Ceviche - much better at Señor Taco and only a little more expensive;
Burritos - much better at Señor Taco and cheaper (or the same);
Soda - cheaper at Señor Taco and free refills (or, if not, they never stopped anyone refilling);
Cleanliness - probably the same, but Don Pancho's looks nicer;
Comfort - No comparison.  Señor Taco is a walk-in fridge compared to this place;
Cost - Bigger portions and tastier at Señor Taco for about the same price or a little less (could be more than a little less if you buy one of their specials).

Would I steer people away from Don Pancho?  No.  The food is good and the people there are really nice.  But having been way too many times to Señor Taco, I'm definitely biased.  You'll have to decide whether that bias is justified ... but I think it is."}
{"text":"Love coming here the plate of carne asada is delicious and omg the pozole is to die for. The staff is friendly and nice every time I come there a lot people"}
{"text":"Taste just like grandma made it! Amazing authentic Mexican food. Clean but small place, but that didn't stop us from devouring our plates. They also give you chips topped with beans and queso fresco, so good!"}
{"text":"A must try! The Asada plate was delicious, generous, and a steal for under $10! The positive ratings are well deserved!"}
{"text":"Really tasty food. I got the chili relleno and an enchilada with beef. The beef in the enchilada was just average but the relleno was very tasty. Horchata was nice too but too sweet. Overall a great place and I would go back."}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Their chips are free with a meal and so delish! The people that work here are so nice too!"}
{"text":"I've never had a better food bargain. Not only is the food very reasonably priced but it is fantastic. Although we don't live here full-time, every time we're in the area we go once a week. I love their Ceviche tostada but everything is good."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever! Grew up in LA and San Diego and this little place in a drip mall is the best ever! Came here twice in three days - makes summer in AZ bearable. Very fresh, crafted with care."}
{"text":"In the late 70's, our family went to the La Fiesta in Orange, CA every other Sunday for their Champagne brunch.  Mom and I were hooked on the Huevos con Chilaquiles.  La Fiesta chilaquiles consisted of a bed of fried corn tortilla strips with a little enchilada sauce, grated Monterrey Jack & Cheddar cheese.  It was then heated in the broiler until the cheese was melted.  Soooo good.

When I read a review of the Huevos con Chilaquiles, I HAD to try it.  These Huevos con Chilaquiles could not be more different than what I thought I was getting.  However, that's not a bad thing.  As I discovered today, the Huevos con Chilaquiles I ate at La Fiesta were about as authentically Mexican as a cheeseburger.

A  bed of fried corn tortilla chips was covered in a deep, richly layered red sauce (that you will not find in the supermarket aisles) and what I am guessing is queso fresco. It didn't have the tang of queso Oaxaca.  It included very tasty beans.  The Mexican rice was unremarkable and didn't deserve to share the plate.

My only gripe with the dish (other than the bland rice) was that the lower layers of the chilaquiles and sauce were cold.  

Don Pancho's is proof that what I have been calling \"Mexican food\" is really \"Mexican-style food\" perverted to American tastes.   Don Pancho's un-apologetically servers authentic Mexican flavors.  I look forward to continuing my education there.
 
If you come on Sunday between 8 & 9:30, there are free tables. After 10AM (when church gets out), you will be waiting."}
{"text":"I was craving authentic Mexican food tonight and have been wanting to try out this place that I found on Yelp in Avondale, Arizona a while back. It's located in a small shopping center and looks and feels like a family owned restaurant where everyone knows everyone. The restaurant was very clean and well kept. There was not anything exciting about the decor and the lighting was very bright. This is def not a date night place but for sure where u wanna be if you want to satisfy your mexican food cravings:) The staff were all very friendly, helpful with suggestions and welcoming. We ordered all of our food at the check-out counter then sat ourselves. The girl at the register gave us some really great suggestion that were consistent with the recommendations I reviewed on Yelp. They gave us a complimentary basket of fresh tortilla chips that were drizzled with bean puree and had gorganzala cheese sprinkled over the top and four different homemade salsas to choose from.  Within 7 minutes our food was served to us. We ordered the carne asada tacos that were cooked to perfection with a lot of flavor! We also ordered the enchiladas, which came with a choice of cheese, beef, chicken or pork and rice and beans. We chose 1 cheese and 2 chicken and the both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come out to Arizona I visit this place! By far my favorite place for tacos, burritos & pozole !"}
{"text":"Just had a fabulous dinner here. This place is kind of a hole in a wall...but cozy and welcoming. You order at the counter. I got enchiladas, my boyfriend got a pork torta...something we had never had. His food came out before mine but we were both blown away. Hands down the best Mexican food we have ever had! After, the waiter came to our table and offered a free dessert since we \"waited so long for the food\". We literally waited 3 minutes! The gesture was so incredibly nice but we totally did not mind the short wait! Would definitely come back!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant in a strip mall and you order your food at the counter and they will bring it out to you. Don't let this fool you though, the food is authentic, service is fast and I'm so glad we chose this place."}
{"text":"Love the food the closest you can get to authentic Mexican food  my favorite is quesadillas de maíz or chile verde burrito the pozole is really good too"}
{"text":"Beef stew was good!! My wife ordered the beef quesadilla and she liked it although it was a bit salty. Servings were huge. We had enough to take home for another meal. Price was reasonable. Will come back again!!"}
{"text":"I got tacos de lengua and tripas here. They were amazing! My friend brought his family and they also loved their food. The customer service was excellent and the restaurant was clean. It's hard to find good tripa and lengua, but this place does them a way that will satisfy anybody."}
{"text":"We tried to go to dinner here based on the Yelp reviews. It was a Tuesday night at 7:00pm and they were closed?"}
{"text":"The food here is really solid. Love their salsa bar. Had a few tacos the first I came, the 2nd time I actually ordered something off the menu. Asked for shrimp cerviche and they totally made it for me. It was awesome. Super friendly here too. Place can get really busy on the weekends 'cause it's that good."}
{"text":"Went here after hitting a local brewery. I ordered the cabeza burrito while my brother order the carne asada burrito.  

The carne asada has a great grilled flavor to it and the cabeza was really flavorful tender. The price is great and food is great, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here specifically because of YELP reviews and was well worth it! The customer service and friendliness of the guy at the counter was just the beginning. I asked about the flautas, the menu stated only beef, but he said they could make chicken no problem! They were great. We also ordered enchiladas, they were delicious as well! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place was great!!! Clean, friendly place with really good food.  The gentleman who serviced us was very helpful.  He explained the menu and gave us wonderful suggestions. The #11 combo was fantastic!  I would eat that everyday. 

Truly this is a really good place to eat for an awesome price.  The jamica is made fresh.  I got a second cup and added rum to it at home...awesome!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in AZ. Im from California and have lots of family in Mexico, I feel like I am out there, the food is delicious and recommend it to anyone. This is real Mexican food, I'm very glad I came here and left very satisfied. Only thing missing is a bar. lol TEN STARS! new favorite spot. Number eleven was fire and so was the al pastor taco, I'm picky with the al pastor but this blew me away, top three in my book. Great spot!!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today.  After telling the man at the counter it was our first visit, he explained the menu.  We ordered chicken tostadas with fresh avocado slices and a chicken burrito.  With drinks, are total came to $13.  Cheap date night for hubby and I...and the food was outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Took a chance to try this highly rated restaurant on a mid afternoon.  Wow!! Great food, all homemade goodness with that family friendliness.  We prefer trying mom and pop joints as they tend to make food with a lot of love.  You will fall in love when you taste their various homemade salsa bar, hand made tortillas and authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Love this place and it is a good sign when you're the only gringo in the place. Already planning my next meal.

One item for the owners information...ordered a Flan for desert and the plastic spoon is razor sharp. Cut up my upper lip and now it stings whenever something touches it. Towards the end of eating the flan I noticed my lip was hurting, investigated and found the spoon is so sharp it can be used as a knife."}
{"text":"Excellen authentic Mexican food and the most friendly people ever!"}
{"text":"Oh wow... I stopped in after having gone down too many wrong roads whilst hungry. I had the chile relleno combo plate, and I am so glad I stopped at Don Pancho! Hands down, best Mexican food I have had in Arizona! Great horchata too! I need to get lost more often..."}
{"text":"Food was so-so. Portions are huge and salsa bar is awesome but the steak was weird tasting and the guacamole was an odd liquidy paste that came in a tiny 2oz cup they charge you extra for. I had to remind the server since they forgot to bring it. The one thing I loved was the bean covered chips they bring you as an appetizer."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place! We are on a road trip to California and decided to stay the night in the Phoenix area. So we checked Yelp for good reviews and this place came up, and they were right on. The food and service were fantastic!"}
{"text":"First of all, I always compare places to my mom's real Mexican food. Nothing ever comes close to my moms food! I don't go to Mexican food restaurants often, but I decided to try this place out because of how many times the place has switched owners and names. I've always tried the different restaurants this place has become. I'm glad I checked it out! The food was awesome. I haven't tried everything yet, but I have tried the tortas, beans, rice, and quesadillas. It was all great and full of flavor. It is probably one of the only places that comes close to my moms Mexican food which to me is saying a lot! Besides the food, it is a great place to eat. Very welcoming and clean. The people who work there talk to you like family, and the place is most likely run by family. I like to support local small businesses like this. So go and do the same and try it!"}
{"text":"Very strong contender for best Carne Asada ever. Only place in my opinion that can hang with BK in Tucson. However the service here is always amazing. Full of families eating and smiling it truly is a fantastic meal. Lately my wife has been ordering the Carne Asada Quesadilla and it is awesome.
Thank you!"}
{"text":"Ok first thing is this is a QSR type of place. It's not a restaurant type. You should not bring a date here. It makes a better lunch place than anything. food was pretty good and the staff was eager to please. Would return but probably for CO or lunch.."}
{"text":"Holy burrito! We came here because my friend is living in Boston and hasn't had good Mexican food in forever. I had been wanting to come here, so it was a win win. I got the Asada burrito. SO FREAKING GOOD!!! She got the mini chimi combo and said it was amazing. The staff is friendly.. We're coming back in a couple of days before she leaves."}
{"text":"Love their carne asada tacos! My husband and I come here often when we need our Mexican food fix! They also have delicious combination plates and champurrado in the winter time!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant with my wife last month and we've been back 3 times since then. The prices are reasonable, the service is VERY friendly, and the food is AUTHENTIC Mexican food. I've tried several different items and meats on the menu and I have yet to be disappointed with the flavors and quality."}
{"text":"This place has tanked.  It is now inedible.  What a shame.  This place should be embarrased serving this low quality food.  We have given the carne asada tacos several chances the past several months.  No Mas.  The carne asada has been so overcooked and tasteless.  The other night the meat was burnt to a crisp and hard crunchy.  Completely unacceptable.  Done.  Not giving them another chance.  Other items may be okay but avoid the carne asada tacos for sure"}
{"text":"I had spicy shrimp... Yum! And, a sample of birria caldo (goat stew).... Double yummy!! Mexicano cuisine authentica!!!!"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Small and homey. Colorful and definitely welcoming. Location is prime because of the other cool places to visit.
SERVICE: Awesome, so friendly. For bringing friends that pronounce the Spanish word for chicken the same as a sport, he was more than willing to give preferences and suggestions. 
FOOD: I ordered a special that includes a sopa, taco, and quesadilla (rice, beans, and horchata). Delicious
PRICE: 10$ for all of that ^^^ fantastic. 
Go Again?: Yes! Absolutely, this place lives up to its yelp review. I wish I could explore more of the menu, but maybe next year."}
{"text":"OK so let me start by saying, \"Why did it take us so long to find this gem?\"
Admittedly, we don't go down Central all that often, but when have, we've see Don Pancho's and thought, we should stop there.  Finally we did!    GREAT authentic food, along with the traditional Mexican us north of the border think of too!  Great carne asada, carnitas, a sweeter pastor, great selection of salsas and attentive service with very reasonable prices!!

We really love your place,your great food and personalities!"}
{"text":"If your from California and your looking for great carne asada look no further!!! Ive been to every taco shop around the avondale/phx area an man this spot is top notch! Honestly your greeted with a smile and treated like familywhat here! they have a huge selection of chimichangas, burritos ,tacos, shrimp cocktails,sopes and many more items, I got 3 carne asadas burritos and dammmm they remind me of my home town shop but they tasted better!! My dad was blown away that we could find better mexican food thenthis our home town in californian. They also had California burritosand which is kind of funny because in some places in California they don't even know what a California burrito is! I would recommend this place to anyone who wants good quality food! Clean tasting and very fresh meat! I was losing hope for Arizona until I found this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'm typically not fund of Mexican food from restaurants, as my parents are AMAZING cooks at home. I came here with my husband and ordered a carne asada plate. He ordered a torts. We really enjoyed the food. The caramelized onions with the asada were delicious along with the corn tortillas. I also thought the chips sprinkled with cheese and beans that  they brought to us before our meals was flavorful and left me wanting more. I can't wait to different food on their menu."}
{"text":"Wasn't wowed by anything in particular, although the chile verde plate was pretty good. Salsa bar was in awful shape when we came in around 6pm: most were empty, and there was a lot of cross \"contamination\". Cilantro and onion trays were all over the place, and all of their salsas were extremely watery. Travel companion had chile verde which I tried. I had asada and carnitas tacos. Carnitas was great, asada had an overwhleming burnt flavor, although it wasn't burnt... I love some good char, but this was on another level."}
{"text":"I'm from California and came across this amazing restaurant while driving by and decided to check it out. I got the 3 rolled taco lunch special and it was absolutely outstanding! The salsa bar is perfect with many choices. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Every time I've been here, the food has come out quickly and it's been delicious. The tacos are cheap and if you check in on Facebook and you get a free one! It's one of those places I suggest to friends quite often."}
{"text":"Little joint, very clean and staff is friendly. Hard to find Authentic Mexican food in this area of town. By far, this is the best considering the area. The chiles rellenos is the best I've tried!"}
{"text":"The most amazing food that I've had in so long. Wow I can't even explain how good. The shrimp cocktail was perfect with just the perfect balance of shrimp to veggies. WOW"}
{"text":"Great food, very tasty. Definitely going to be on my list. The tacos are hands down the best."}
{"text":"Like homemade!!! Definitely coming back, had their #12 with the mexican quesadilla, sope and al pastor taco! Delish"}
{"text":"It was a really authentic Mexican spot in Goodyear. I was the only white guy there and glad that I spoke some Spanish - because they don't speak English very well. The food was good and the price was better."}
{"text":"The carne asada is the best...and their red chile is also amazing. I wish I would have known of this place sooner!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a fabulous find for authentic Mexican food. You place your order at the counter, the chips and salsa are brought to your table, and they're amazing, and when the food is brought to your table it's delicious! This is a small restaurant in a strip mall with a friendly staff, and good service."}
{"text":"Great prices, wonderful service, and yummy food.  The lunch ceviche was like $4. I got a whole bowl of shrimp ceviche with a bowl of chips and unlimited trips to the salsa bar. Wow!  How do you beat that?!
Last week I had the red chili! Oh my gosh-so yummy!"}
{"text":"Thought we would try something different since we were going to Goodyear! We both tried the lunch specials, hubby had enchiladas, and I had tacos! The chips were tasty, they served first, the food was good but nothing special! Portion was small but it was the special for lunch! Don't know if we will return, so many Mexican restaurants around! I was hoping for something different and special, did not find it here, but as I said it was good, just nothing special!!!"}
{"text":"Most delicious Mexican food I've ever eaten!! Quesadilla al Pastor was on POINT! And the chips and salsa were delicious as well! Highly recommended! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We were excited to find a place the served menudo AND posole.  The menu looked excellent and the aromas were wonderful.  The place was clean.  Chips and salsa were supposed to come with the meal but no, we didn't get that.  We asked for oregano, but never got that either.  When we asked again, they said someone will come by to our table.  No one ever did although two tables next two us were visited by waitstaff three times but never stopped once at ours.  The broth for both the menudo and posole were thin and lacked flavor.  We asked for a chile relleno on the side, but never received that.  Anyway, we were hungry, finished half and left.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"They have the best tasting mexican food out  here in the west valley by far. I'm originally from San Antonio, Texas so my taste buds scream Tex-Mex when it comes to Mexican food. So being stationed here I could not find anything close to home until I came here. The food is so flavorful and delicious I was amazed. It reminded me so much of home. I always leave satisfied. I enjoy everything about this place from the mom and pop hospitality (owners are so sweet, helpful, and friendly), the cheap prices, and once again the delicious food. 

STOP BY, I PROMISE YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED! :)"}
{"text":"This food is the best Mexican food on the West side. We have been many times and always receive excellent service, super yummy food, and a warm atmosphere. 

Keep in mind you aren't going to get a fancy building, but you will get crazy good food and a smile. 

We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great authentic atmosphere taste of real Mexico for sure! Had simple #2 simple taquitos, rice and beans plate. Rice perfect, beans authentic, and the taquitos looked like store bought but not. Great shredded beef taquitos. Truly a hidden gem worth the off 10 fwy trip if you want real Mexican not America-Mexican!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal, drive across town for it, mom and pop kind of Mexican food place you won't find too often.. I dream about the salsa bar and free chips which come gratis with just the right amount of refried beans and Mexican cheese drizzled across the tops.. My go to plate is the camarones Diablo which is a real mouth pleaser.. Fresh grilled shrimp smothered with a delicious spicy red sauce and \"just like your buelita used to make\" beans and rice! And don't even get me started on the house made white corn tortillas!!!! Trust this will be your new favorite Mexican food in the valley"}
{"text":"Simply great Mexican food at great prices. Without a doubt, I will be eating here often as I attempt to eat everything on their menu. Service was excellent, but their food is the reason I'll keep going back. With real Mexican food restaurants like this, I have no idea how Taco Bell exists in Arizona."}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic taste. Food was fresh. The homemade tortillas were delicious. Price was very affordable and servings were good. Daily specials available as well. 
We had a caldo de res, steak tacos and chorizo con huevos breakfast."}
{"text":"Consistently great!! We have gone through the whole menu at this point... Never disappointed. You go during lunch time and it's hard to find seating popular little place. My favorites are the posole, the cheap street tacos, sopas trust me, and the chilaques. Breakfast is served all day long"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic.  Some of the best carne asada I've ever had, same for the al pastor.  The corn tortillas and sopes are out of this world.  Salsas are all fantastic (if not a little too on the mild side, but that's okay).  Very friendly and prompt service, and great prices.  I'll hit this place at least once a week for lunch.

I'll have to make sure I get something with flour tortillas next time, since we all know how important that is towards the success of this type of restaurant!"}
{"text":"A bright and cheerful place with delicious food; one of the best chile rellenos we've ever tasted. Don't be fooled by the strip mall location; they even have a nice patio."}
{"text":"Hands down the best authentic Mexican restaurant in the area! If you are craving really good Mexican food that is legititmate this is the place! On our visit we had a little bit of everything, Tortas , carne asada, carnitas and more. The Horchata is fantastic as well. Also the staff at Don Pancho are amazing really friendly, and extremely helpful. If you are a bit confused on your Mexican food choices the staff is more than willing to step you through it. Overall an amazing Mexican joint in the Goodyear area!"}
{"text":"Tonight I tried the quesadilla de maiz with chicken. It was so good! It is my new go to."}
{"text":"I consider myself a snob when it comes to Mexican food as I cook it myself ~ but this place is the real deal. Their beans are authentic and delicious ~ so that was a good start!  The carne asada tacos were good ~ and their salsas were incredible. We all enjoyed our meal. Everyone was welcoming and the place was very clean.  Definitely recommend Don Panchos!!!  Provecho!"}
{"text":"Salsa bar was fully stocked. Plenty home made Mexican food. Wonderful service. Pozole was on point and the rice and beans actually had flavor. Going back soon."}
{"text":"After seeing some good reviews for this place I decide to check it out.. It was very disappointed. My boyfriend got some carne asada tacos and they were ok nothing that would make us crave them. While, I got the carne asada burrito and I was very disappointed! The meat was dry, and to make matters worse the salsa bar didn't have many options. Plus, the salsa that was already there looked all watery which didn't make the dry burrito any better. Defiantly not coming again!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered the chicken chimichanga. The service was very friendly and fast The ladies here are really friendly. Don Pancho has the best red chicken chimichanga that I've tried in the West valley. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ok, being a carne asada burrito aficionado from San Diego California, I judge Mexican restaurants on this one simple order, well this and the restaurant's salsa.  I always search for the best Mexican restaurant when I move from place to place since I am a military man so I have to tell you, this place isn't too bad.  I stopped here because of the good reviews so I wanted to test its authenticity.  First, let me judge the restaurant experience before the food quality:

- Cleanliness:  B
- Amenities:  B
- Timeliness:  C
- Price:  B+
- Atmosphere:  D (no air conditioning, hello! Phoenix/Goodyear!)
- Courtesy of Employees:  C
- Quality of Food:  B+

Ok, after sweating my butt off for 20 minutes to get my food from a \"family member who took my order\", we loaded up on extras from the salsa bar (two types of tomatillo salsa, two types of red salsa, pickled carrots, pickled peppers galore).  We told the \"Order Taker\" that our meal was \"to go\", but a waitress brought us an open plate of food anyway.  Let's cut to the quality of food.  I expect authentic carne asada burritos to have these special features:

- home made tortillas (extra large)
- grilled flank steak or steak that resembles
- pico de gallo
- guacamole

If anything else is added, it needs to compliment the burrito.  So, let's talk Don Pancho's!  The tortilla was authentic!  The steak was GREAT!  The pico de gallo was devoid/not there which was a disappointment (however, there was some cilantro).  There was NO GUACAMOLE!  On top of this, Don Pancho's added refried beans and rice as a filler.  Boooooooo.

Needless to say, the filler was minimal so I kinda enjoyed the burrito.  Though I can't review the rest of their menu (my wife had the flautas which she enjoyed), I hope this review helps you understand this restaurant's quality."}
{"text":"Looking forward to coming back again and again.  My husband and I shared two carne asada tacos and two carnitas tacos.  They were both really really good, very fresh.  The salsa bar had a great variety of salsas that we couldn't decide on, so we sampled all of them!  By far tho, I loved the salsa that came with the chips."}
{"text":"FINALLY a good Mexican restaurant!!! My husband & I ate here and we will be back! Very small inside with only 10 or so tables, but we didn't have a problem finding one on a Saturday evening. I had the chicken enchiladas & my husband had a carne asada burrito & pork tacos. Mine was delicious, and so was his. The pork was so flavorful!"}
{"text":"There were some nice reviews for this place so my wife and I decided to check it out. The prices were affordable and chips and salsa came with your order. The decor was tired and out of date. Service was solid but salsa bar subpar. The food itself was tasty and plentiful however, less than 30 minutes after we left, both my wife and I felt awful spending quality time with the bathroom instead of with each other. Maybe it was an off night and I'm not accusing the place of making us sick - but I won't be back."}
{"text":"The food is really good here. Delicious tortas, tacos De asada, burritos and huevos rancheros... we came to spring training and found this place, had to stop by once again before we left."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE MEXICAN PLACE EVER!!! As someone who is Mexican lol I don't like to go out to eat food that I can make at home but this place is amazing! It is a family owned restaurant and the staff is so sweet! My fav is the caldo de Rez and chilaquiles. It is a small place so if it is busy expect to wait a while since there is not tons of seating but definitely worth the wait"}
{"text":"Really really great food, friendly staff, good portions....what's not to love! Indoor and outdoor seating and a wonderful salsa bar. It's a great place for Sunday lunch, or really any time at all. We haven't tried breakfast there yet, but are planning to soon. It's a bit of a drive for us but its totally worth it. DP does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Wow, right off the bat the cashier was very welcoming and his service skills were on point. Ran thru the menu and took his recommendations and ordered #11, #8, menudo, and the goat soup. #11 was the ribs and its like nothing I've ever had before. Like the man said, this is not just food, its an experience. Boy I'll be back every year from now on."}
{"text":"One of the best, if not the best, mexican food spots in metro Phoenix. If you can't read Spanish, ask. Don't trust reviewers who get the white boy Mexican food aka \"California\" burrito or like horchatta from a fountain drink dispenser. Try the Birria or green chile plate. Some of the best beans you'll have. The salsa served with the chips and beans is awesome."}
{"text":"Yet another fabulous meal!  The service is pleasant.  It is a pleasure eating there."}
{"text":"Small but food is large. Had many things on menu and have enjoyed them all. Staff is fast and friendly. Especially when it's busy they move to get tables cleaned and ready. Prices are very reasonable portion are great for either lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Good salsa bar Nice service,+ coke in a glass bottle Perfecto. Did tacos and a shredded chicken quesadilla with a varietal of salsas the two Verdes were the hitters. Could be tricky to find if you ain't familiar so b aware."}
{"text":"I always judge a mexican place by their Burritos.  This is a very common staple in mexican cuisine and every place usually makes them. The burritos here were ok. So were the tacos just ok. I maybe need to try something else here, for now it's ok."}
{"text":"Wife and I took a trip over here because I wanted GOOD mexican. We show up and I see you have to order at a counter and my hopes were dashed, but we were already here so I figured I would eat some meh tacos and never come back. The guy behind the counter is AMAZING. Super friendly, funny, and welcoming. I am convinced it is to make up for meh food but non the less still impressed. We get our free chips and salsa which were pretty good and I start to think this might be pretty good after all. We then get our food and I realized I would be going to this spot for mexican from now on. Amazing service, great food, prices that make you think it might be a front business, and did I mention great food at great prices."}
{"text":"This is a great family owned Mexican food restaurant. It recently opened and has been a great success with the local community. They serve tacos, sopes, burritos, enchiladas, etc. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is very clean. I would definitely recommend trying the chiles rellenos!"}
{"text":"Once again, A review lost in the Yelp black hole. I know I did a review on this before! Anyway, Wife and I had the foster kids, and Mom with us. We decided to meet our daughter and boyfriend for dinner. We were supposed to eat somewhere else, however something happened and I was in a rush to find a place. I have heard of Don Pancho, but did not know this was a hole in the wall joint. When we arrived here, I was like no way! Not going to eat here. It was getting late and my mom was like, the kids are hungry and lets just eat here. 
1st, 
There was ten of us,
2nd,
Don Pancho was going to close in a half hour. However they said not a problem. So they put a few tables together for us and we all sat down.

We ordered all sorts of items. I had the chili verde burrito, it was great. My mom and some kind of quesadilla. It was corn and fried. It was awesome. I had the luxury to try many items that night, and I can not say there was anything bad. 
Workers there are really nice, they did not have to serve us so late, but they did and I am glad. Prices are very reasonable, Food is great. 

They fooled me, I wasn't interested to eat here, but thanks to mom. We tried it and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING! YELPERS RAISE YOUR STANDARDS!! RUN AWAY!

I ordered a shredded beef burrito combo but was told that combos don't come with a drink, even though the board behind the counter says \"Combos include rice, beans, and a fountain drink\". So she insisted on charging me extra because my particular combo was not on the board, even though she charged me extra to \"make it a combo\". Nice.

The bag of chips that came with the meal, you need to see it to believe it. I posted a photo. Literally like 5 chips. You can barely find them at the bottom of the paper bag. FAIL!

Nachos... They microwaved the nachos IN THE STYROFOAM CONTAINER!!!! The styrofoam melted, obviously poisoning my food with all sorts of chemicals, and they microwaved the container CLOSED so it made all the previously crispy tortilla chips soggy like dishtowels.

Lastly, I asked for enchilada sauce to be put *inside* my bean burrito. What did they do? Yep, they put it on the SIDE and gave me a dry burrito with no sauce inside.

I don't know what's wrong with all of you Yelpers who rated this place four or five stars, but to you I have this to say: RAISE YOUR DAMN STANDARDS! You have no idea what good Mexican food is, and Don Pancho's is THE WORST."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!  Excellent customer service and very delicious food. The atmosphere is very inviting.  My daughter loves the children menu options,  I enjoy the chimichanga while my husband tries something different each time.  Tonight he had the caldo de res (in 109 degree weather) and says it was amazing.  We enjoy this cozy mom and pop taco stop.  So will you!

P.s the the restrooms are always tidy which is important for me."}
{"text":"Believe the hype, the food is awesome. The tacos are small but so flavorful and perfect for the price. I could eat the carnitas everyday. The staff is very friendly and helpful when I can't make up my mind. My favorite place when I need a taco fix.  Go early and avoid the crowds"}
{"text":"The Caldo de Rez is my fav!!! They do it right here & I always come here when I'm craving it."}
{"text":"Good food and a fun atmosphere! I loved the feel of this place. I like that you order at the counter and your food is brought out to you. We stopped in during lunch and they had about 5 lunch specials, which is a decent selection. I ordered the green chile burrito and it was okay. The meat was tender and juicy, but only half of my burrito had meat. The chile was okay, but overall it was bland. My husband got the asada torta and really enjoyed it. He said the asada is some of the best he's had. All in all, we'll try this place again."}
{"text":"This place used to be good we would go around 2-3 times a week. Starting a couple weeks back the service has taken a nose dive. 

It takes 30-40 minutes to get your food  and   they still get your order wrong and also forget about getting the complementary chips anymore. The first time this happened I gave them the benefit of doubt but when it happened again  it now just seems they don't care anymore. Not even an apology for taking so long. 

I doubt I  will be going back again anytime soon. So if you have a couple of hours to spare go ahead an visit this place."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food.  Carne Asada tacos are amazing, they come with grilled onions and pepper. GF had chilaquiles w/ eggs and she really liked them.  The service is just as great.  Very friendly."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!


Don Poncho  is a great restaurant with very little pretense, stellar food and excellent service.  So if you are looking for really good Mexican cuisine look no more. Don Poncho  is one of  the best Mexican food places in the valley. 

There are plenty of choices for appetizers, entrees and desserts. 
Every dish is visually enticing. The pastor sopes are wonderful some of  the best I've ever tasted and the Chile Rellenos are off the charts delicious! 

Highly recommended to all looking for authentic Mexican food in a town consumed with chain \"Mexican Restaurants\"."}
{"text":"FINALLY! I grew up in and around Tamaulipas and I miss genuine homemade Mexican food. This is it. The real deal. The carnitas are so amazing, the chicken is flavorful and moist. They hand cook everything, no premixed anything here. Deserves a visit from Food Network but I'm terrified it'll be ruined afterward. Only have about 10 tables inside so try to come after the lunch rush. So worth the wait."}
{"text":"We are from California, my family came here for lunch. The service was great! But the food is not authentic . We order a shrimp fajita came with American cheese."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food!! The best I have had since I moved to AZ. The restaurant atmosphere is nothing to brag about but we were there for the food. The workers were very nice and pleasant. I was the only white person in the place but did not feel out of place at all. Everyone made you feel welcome. I can't say enough about the food...it was delicious."}
{"text":"What a refreshing change in Mexican food! We felt as though the owners had invited us over to their home for dinner. Having moved from TN to this area the experience made me think of a Mexican Meat N Three. Fresh food that was homecooked."}
{"text":"Like agree with a lot of the other reviews about this place. Everything does taste very homemade the owners are the people that help you out when ordering and I want to say they are also the cooks. So it's like going to your Mexican parents house to eat which of course I love.
 
     They have a variety taco meats my favorite and the best to get just to play it safe then if you like those you can start trying the other meats. This is true anywhere you go.


      I don't think I have any complaints about the place. It's always very clean and organized even when it's busy and the people don't stop being any nicer. Their salsa bar is always clean which is something to always look at, always!"}
{"text":"Great authenticate Mexican food. Can get it to go or done in. Tortillas are homemade and fresh. Had the green chili burrito, it did not disappointed. Food comes with chips smothered in delicious beans."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The green chili pork tips are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great people, good menu, good food. 

Tacos good, normal shredded beef tacos. 
Bean Burritos, normal good beans
Rice, normal good rice. 
Al Pastor quesadilla, really good but the flavor was a burnt smoky flavor. It was good but I got tired of it quickly. 

Staff and prices were good too."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service! Salsas were awesome and the horchata is great!"}
{"text":"Killer Mexican Food done right!!!!!!!!!!

My wife, who I swear is a Hispanic woman stuck in a white girl body has been dying for some Mexican food and this bookmarked gem was the spot for us.

There is nothing, I mean nothing to say negative about this great restaurant. The staff was very outgoing and friendly. The spot, while small in size, had a very comfortable feel that was evident by how all patrons looked like they felt at home. As for the food, I loved it. I wish I had the space in my belly to try it all. I did try. Here is the breakdown:

Complimentary chips covered in beans and cheese-so good. Not a ton, but just the perfect amount to prepare for more fatness to come.

Salsa- this stuff is the best. It came with the chips and I did request more for the rest of my grub. I loved it sooooooooo much. Make sure to try it and to get it from the staff. 

Chorizo quesadilla- Yummy, greasy goodness. It was so full of chorizo and I wish I had more. Only negative is my wife ate the leftover quesadilla before I could beat her to the punch. Dang!!!!

Red Sauce Beef Chimi-Crispy Shell, amazing sauce, and yummy meat, what else could I ask for? This chimi was just what I was hoping for and I will have it again in the future for sure. I added beans and rice and they too, of course, were as good as one could hope.

I just enjoyed the whole meal so much and I will be back here again and again, oh and again."}
{"text":"Oh my Gato... as soon as I get back to Phoenix, step off the airplane I'm bringing my happy ass right back to Don Pancho's!!  This place is AH-MAZE-ING!!!  I tried every taco they offer (don't judge me, we just finished hiking the White Tanks) and each one was better than the last.  Salsa bar, fresh and fresh, check.  Fantastic Horchata, check.  Best street tacos I've had since being in Sayulita Mexico, check!  Super rad/friendly employees, double check.  They were so helpful and accommodating, the nice lady went back and brought us a basket of chips with each of the different taco meats on them so we could try them out.  Who is that awesome?  Don Pancho's, that's who!!  My wife tried the fried quesadilla and I still have dreams about that thing, usually it ends with me waking up in a cold sweat chomping on my pillow.  

Anyway, if you live in or near Phoenix and haven't been the Don Pancho's yet, you should be ashamed of yourself and should probably move to Antarctica, or the moon."}
{"text":"Food is amazing here!! My favorite is the birria..you can't go wrong with what you order here and the people are so nice they're always checking if you're doing ok"}
{"text":"Kind and welcoming staff, great food, music, salsa bar, and chips. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"Menudo  is what I ordered and it was hot and yummy, it came with four corn tortillas and all the good stuff you put in menudo. I recommend if you are not to hungry that you order the small bowl . I ordered the large and it was huge and had to leave some behind. The location is small and you order at the counter and they bring the food to your table, one thing about the place it is HOT HOT and stuffy we got there at 8 am and it was 90 degrees inside this place they had ceiling fans but it still was hot. I will eat there again when it's not so hot inside or out !"}
{"text":"I was impress with their selection of tacos and the flavor was very good. Their service was also very nice...I'm definitely  going back"}
{"text":"This is a total hidden Jem! The Mrs and I had the menudo. It was fresh, athentic, and rich in flavor. Have not had one like this in AZ. Only in Cali or Mexico. Also chips with beans and cheese at everytable with tasty salsa. This place is a must try."}
{"text":"Amazing! I searched on Yelp and saw this restaurant. Since I was craving Mexican food decided to check this place out.

Located in a small strip mall across the road from a Catholic Church, don't be dismayed by the location for this place serves great tasting Mexican food. 

Displayed on the entrance window are the specials in English. Since I was getting food to go I went straight to the counter and a very pleasant man took my order, I asked him how long it would take as I might go outside and wait since the weather was so nice, he told me around 10 minutes but not to worry because if ever he will just look for me to give me my order (what great service).

So My husband and I sat outside soaking up the warm weather, a nice lady came out and brought out nachos and salsa whilst waiting.

After 10 minutes the very nice man at the counter came out with the food I ordered.. He did look for me hehehe 

I just love this place and wish we have this restaurant in Pennsylvania! I will definitely be returning to this restaurant again before leaving to go back home.

I had the tortas asada with con papas ( Mexican steak sandwhich with French fries) and my husband had the beef tacos (it was one of the specials) sorry no pictures as the food got devoured instantly lol.

Please do not hesitate to try this place out, a small restaurant but with great food and service :)"}
{"text":"carne asada tacos are so good!!!
nice little place. the service was good and the people were nice.
will absolutely return. thanks!"}
{"text":"I hardly get out to the westside but when I do I try to hit this place. Great friendly service and the food is really good. Prices are cheap also. Keep up the great service and food!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand why this place has such a high rating. Tacos were average, tostada was stale. Meat tastes cheap. I would not recommend this place and unfortunately there are not any good taco shops in the area. This place is average at best and bot very clean."}
{"text":"The food tasted original and homemade authentic food. There's sopes can be a but undercooked hitting your palette with a dry doughy taste. Overall very satisfied with the food."}
{"text":"Don Pancho grills their carne asada over charcoal. Need I say anything else? Yes I do.

Everything is prepared to order. It comes out hot and delicious. 

The restaurant may seem older, BUT it is kept very, very clean and tidy. The owners are very kind and enjoy talking to their customers. 

They offer you complimentary chips topped with frijoles and white queso fresco. The frijoles are silky smooth and savory. The chipotle salsa is unbelievably good. Deliciousness all around!

Items my family and I ordered:
- Chimichanga w/ Red Chilli Beef - spicy, hot deliciousness. Not too spicy, but Br prepared to fill your drink cup frequently. An overall great item. 

- 3 Carne asada taco plate - these are smaller street-style tacos. The carne asada is well-seasoned, smokey, and tender. It comes with a wedge of grilled onions which adds a great depth of flavorful. - Carnitas quesadilla - crispy tortilla, not too cheesy, and the carnitas are crispy and flavorful. 

- Birria - I'd come here solely for the birria, which is only served on certain days. The broth has great depth of flavor from the many spices, and when you add the lime and onions, gets even better. The meat is fall off the bone tender. 

- Carne asada burrito plate - The burrito only contains rice, asada, and some onions. That is all that it needs anyways. As stated before, the asada is awesome! The rice has great flavor, and the frijoles is well seasoned and creamy in texture. 

- Tripa taco - Worth trying. Crispy, clean taste with no bitterness. Great option to the asada. 

- Cabeza taco - Very good. Tender and moist. It tastes like stewed ox tail.

- Lengua taco - another great option if you want to try it. Very, very delicious. 

You won't go wrong with anything on the menu. Be adventurous, try anything and everything. 

I am definitely going to be a repeat customer, and will be recommending my friends to come here."}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic! This is worth the drive from anywhere. I had a big bowl of menudo with home made corn tortillas. Perfect. We also ordered an asada burro, chicken enchiladas and chicken tacos. All were wonderfully spiced. The red enchilada sauce is as good as my home made sauce. The tacos are on home made corn tortillas and are like a street taco. The rice and beans are good too as are the fresh corn chips with beans and conejito cheese served before our meals arrived.
I strongly recommend finding this cute restaurant! We definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Just like another reviewer, not sure I want anyone else to know about this awesome place.  It is quite small and you have to time it right on a Sunday because it is across the street from the Catholic Church.  Luckily we make to 7am mass and wait for the doors to open at 8am.  But still very cozy when you share a table with someone else.
Every meal we have ordered is delicious.  And not sure but I think the homemade corn tortillas are made to order. Whatever I order, I always add a tripas taco to it. Recently I ordered a caldo de res and was delivered menudo instead. The server quickly replaced it and gave me a to-go container for the now free menudo.  
Try it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow - had Taco with shredded beef, Quesadillia Pork Carnitas and Chicken Sope,  And the chips with the beans and cheese they give you is simply outstanding - and the sauces.  Only thing that could improve the experience would have been a frozen margarita!"}
{"text":"Good fast service great food very helpful and willing to give you samples of meat to try. I recommend  \"beef tongue\" there's is really good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite mexican food in Phoenix. I could come here every day except Sunday because it gets crazy busy. But the customer service is great and the food is better"}
{"text":"Positives:  Everything positive here!!  If you are looking for some authentic Mexican food this place is legit.  We stopped in after seeing such great reviews of this little place and once we did, we agreed we will be regular goers. 

We started with the complimentary chips and salsa which had beans and white cheese on the chips. The salsa they serve with these chips is outstanding!!!!! It is not hot but is extremely unique in flavor and consistency. (I would ask for two sides of salsa since it's not a very large portion.) I got the 3 beef red chili enchilada platter and my husband got the red chili beef chimichanga.  We also ordered a chorizo quesadilla to share. Okay..  listen when I say that you need this food in your belly!  ASAP.  The red chili enchilada sauce is perfection.  I can be picky about red sauce and this one is a 5 star.  The shredded beef was flavorful and yummy.  This chorizo quesadilla was an original in taste, we loved it. Greasy as expected and amazing.  The rice and beans were also great in flavor.  It is the type of food you would expect to be handed down from generations of great recipes and flavors.  Plenty of sauce and cheese in all the right places and they didn't  skimp on our dinner portions one bit. 

We enjoyed the kind staff and I believe the owner.  It is clear they care about their restaurant and want their customers to enjoy their food and stay.  It was an all over nice time and we will be back.  

Updated review:
We went to eat here again and we were still blown away. Quality food here with crazy good flavor.  Still a FIVE STAR!!!"}
{"text":"I was in Arizona for 3 1/2 days visiting friends and dined at Don Poncho twice, because it's THAT good!

The service is exceptional and the waitstaff is very friendly and attentive.  This little place always has a packed house so be patient when waiting for your food.  Trust me, it's well worth the wait.  

Here's what the group got over two days:
Carne Asada plate, carnitas burrito, chicken burrito, carne burrito, chicken tacos, chicken enchiladas, pineapple aqua fresca.   What can I say?   The meat is tender, their tortillas are piping hot and yummy and the beans are so smooth and go so well with their chips and homemade salsa.   I can't seem to get enough of their rice which is so simple but so good.   

Next time, I'll have to get the horchata!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food, because why buy it when we can just go to grandmas house right? Except grandma has a life too lol. Don Panchos is definitely one of my weekend go to's not only has their food not failed me but the customer service is so great even when they are busy! Sometimes they forget our order but they always make it up so I let it slide  I have terrible luck trying new menu items but like I said they haven't failed me at all."}
{"text":"Great spot for authentic food and great service & prices. I loved the Frieda Kahlo paintings that were abundant also."}
{"text":"Closed on Monday. ... However I did get to stop in on Tuesday. I am glad that I did, the green chile burrito is made of a fresh flour tortilla that is made in house.  The chips and salsa that came with it were top notch, crisp and warm.  I also had the chile relleno which was very good and had a nice salsa topping.  Fellow Yelpers are spot on and I am glad that I tried out this local fav.  Finding places like this are exactly why I love Yelp.  I cannot wait to come back and try other items, like the Goat Soup."}
{"text":"100% authentic. This has been a family favorite for a few years now, and by far, one of the BEST places I have EVER eaten. Their Lengua, Carne, & Birria are AMAZING!!! Everything here is homemade and truly incredible. Cornerstone of Avondale"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in before the Cardinals game for dinner. This place is excellent!  The staff was so kind and gave is samples of there red and green sauces with chips.  I ordered a red chili burrito which came with delicious rice and beans. My wife ordered cheese enchiladas. Both meals were delicious and large portioned. The prices were awesome 2 delicious meals for 20 dollars. Some of the best Mexican food in town. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Saw a recommendation on yelp to try this place a few weeks ago and tonight we finally made it in.  The place was in a little strip mall and is just a small little place but totally worth it. 

 The combinations include a drink beans and rice which is great! I had the mini chimis and my husband ordered the posole.  The mini chimis were perfect. the husband said his posole was great but it was mostly juice.  We came right before close so I am thinking that may have something to do with it.  My father in law had the carne asada plate and he just about licked the plate clean he enjoyed it so much.

The free chips come with beans and cheese on top and the salsa is on point.  Overall a great little mexican place and we will most definitely be stopping by again. If you are looking for a good low key inexpensive meal this is the spot."}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic Mexican food! Wow. I got 2 carne asada tacos. Only $1.50 each. The meat was tender and flavorful. Not fatty at all. I also got a horchata. Delicious!

Great customer service. Very friendly. I can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have tasty affordable lunch specials for $5.99. The food is always fresh and delicious and the service is very friendly.The chips served with a little beans and cheese is unique & delicious."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try Don Panchos based on the reviews. We've been trying to find great Mexican food in the West Valley and I was sure this was going to be our new spot, sadly I was wrong. 

The pros: good salsa, good tortillas and decent taquitos. 

The cons: the carne asada was way too salty (like inedible), the rice had no flavor and was either undercooked or had been sitting for way too long, when the table next to ours was being bussed, they put the dirty plates on our table, and (saving the best for last) I felt like they treated us like a couple of gringos, like we shouldn't be in their restaurant because we're white. It was the most uncomfortable I've ever been in a restaurant in my life. 

The quest for great Mexican food in the West Valley continues. As for Don Panchos, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Its SO bad! I dont know what kind of LSD the other reviewers were on (obviously the GOOD stuff) but seriously its THAT bad. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Will try again but next time dine in. 3 of us ordered to go. None of us got our chips. My green chili chimichanga was great! My daughter got shredded beef chimichanga and said it was boring. Hubby ordered the crunchy tacos and 2 soft tacos and said they were just okay. I think dining in might be better since we can eat it Fresh from the kitchen. We'll see. Might just need to figure out what to order."}
{"text":"We came to this place because we saw a lot of god reviews and it did not disappoint my family and I really liked everything we ordered. Will come back."}
{"text":"Very friendly service, I love the costumer service here. Their chips are delicious and crisp, their tostadas are my favorite and this is our hit lunch spot."}
{"text":"The entire restaurant was filled. Took an incredible 40 minutes to get our food. We ordered a breakfast burrito and a torta combo. We were able to sit down after standing and waiting for 35 minutes. Initially we ordered to eat in, and then my boyfriend asked for our food to go at the 30 minute mark. This is only because we were giving up on ever getting a seat.  

When we did get a seat, the worker informed some people who just came in that we had our order to go. Why? I have no idea. It's like they didn't want us to change our mind to eat in even though we waited well over 30 minutes for our food. Anyways, the other customer harassed us to have our table and the man at a smaller table nearby. Rude? I think so.   

Overall, a horrible experience trying to eat in. Not enough seating options. Yes, there is outdoor seating, but it's near the huge garbage. And as you can guess, it smells disgusting outdoors.   

Would I come here to eat again? Not if it's indoors, and not if I want my food quickly. The food was very okay.   

TLDR: Awfully slow service, not enough seating, not the best staff."}
{"text":"It didn't disappoint in the slightest, I had the marinated grilled pork and it was delicious. Service was friendly and restaurant was clean (from what I could see). Prices were reasonable.  I've had bigger burritos at other places, but if you prefer quality of quantity this is the place. The burrito I had was enough to fill me up and I didn't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Plato de asada is great! Food came out about two min after I ordered it. Friendly service. ..

I would defiantly eat here again."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and again don't know what we've been waiting for , yum yum , had two different tacos and chicken torta both awesome , staff very friendly, will definitely be back"}
{"text":"If you want Mexican Food this is the place to go. The prices are great especially for the amount of food you get. I had a torta that was delicious which came with yummy fries.  The service is good and friendly. Small place but there is additional seating outside."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm beginning to think there is no great Mexican food in AZ. I moved here from Chicago a year ago and have been to about 1/2 dozen Mexican restaurants with 4 star plus and reviews and I'm left thinking, \"really\"? 

I dropped in last Friday late afternoon after the Sox-Cubs game in Glendale with my daughter. I live in Goodyear and thought I would give this place a try based on the reviews. Nothing fancy in the ambiance. It's a small storefront location, place your order at the counter, sit down and someone brings your order. The gentleman at the counter couldn't have been more pleasant. Patient, smiling, helpful. I was really excited to see the place full of locals. (Usually a good sign, right?) We ordered a steak and chicken burrito dinner and sat down at a table.

The chips and salsa were pretty good. There is an awesome salsa they provide that was really tasteful (tasted a little smoky and spicy) The salsa bar was pretty good, too. Their carrots and jalapenos were very good. At this point, Don Pancho is grooving in the 4 star range.

After about a 25 min. wait for our food, the kindly gentleman brought our order over to the the only other Caucasian couple table in the place. I stopped him and asked if that was our order and the other couple (obviously not too familiar with Mexican food and they came in 15 mins after us) looked confused- but they ordered tacos. So the kindly gentleman brought our order to our table. All down hill from here. Steak burrito- grisly, tough, overcooked, too salty. Chicken burrito- tough, boiled, bland. Beans were really great. Rice was okay. Man was I disappointed. I've read other reviews and was really hyped to try this place out. Also, there were about 4 people waiting for about 30 mins for their orders. I'm really not too sure what takes them so long to deliver, but if the food was worth the wait it doesn't matter. I can't say it was.

After one year in Phoenix, Senor Taco is still the best experience I've had with Mexican food. (Who would of thought?) I'm going to start visiting the taco shacks on 85. There has to be a diamond in the rough here somewhere."}
{"text":"Costillas de Puerco en Chile Verde was awesome. Fresh corn tortillas to top it off. Fast and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Excellent establishment. Food, Price, and Service were all on point!!!  Took my family of 10 there and we had a terrific time.  People were super nice and food was good.  Next time I am in Town I will try it out again."}
{"text":"Nice, welcoming atmosphere with delicious food. The prices are just right for the portions they provide and they also have a mini bar set aside for extra condiments on your meal. Will be coming back"}
{"text":"Came here for Togo and they were really nice and friendly! It was a little hard to find because it was so small. 

Chimichanga- it was good but I've had better.. The lengua was very tender though. It just wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked.
Asada plate- the Mexican rice was very good! Wish they gave more! The asada tasted a little burnt to me.
Carne asada tacos- little cousin enjoyed this but she said it tasted a bit burnt for her too. 
Horchata- I don't usually drink this so I'm not sure how it's suppose to taste like. However, it was very good and light in cinnamon. Good for me bc I don't really like anything with too much cinnamon besides churros. They gave a little ice which is a plus!"}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable. Great service! Very impressed.  Will definitely be going back again! 
Tip: it's hidden amongst construction and easy to miss. Worth the effort to find it!"}
{"text":"Came here to check out the local Mexican place and come to find a gem!!! Homemade tortillas, DELICIOUS beans, and salsas galore!! The service was excellent as well! We ordered and 5 minutes later we had chips and frijoles taken to us as a starter. Very good! We are definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Finally!!!  A really good Mexican restaurant close by   Yummy!!!    We are all so happy that we found this place"}
{"text":"The carne asada was excellent!!!  Cute little place and very busy--the popularity shows that this place has excellent food!  Very nice people.  We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Fast and delicious! Always in and out within 40 minutes. I love their ceviche tostadas. Their carne Asada tacos are also delicious. They have crispy flautas that come in a plate with beans and rice. Their burritos chimichangas are huge. Their enchiladas are good too. I recommend this place. With $20 two people can eat comfortably!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed! It's not reasonable in price for what they give you. The portions are small and I couldn't even see the meat in my taquitos. I think business would be much better if they went down on their prices and gave you more. For what I spent there I could of spent less somewhere else and got way more food for my money."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried it you are missing out! Great food, great prices...enough said."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite mexican place here in avondale. Their lunch specials are the best!! And that salsa they give you for the chips keeps you wanting more. What keeps me coming back is not only their great food but how nice the people are. Definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best tasting tacos I've had ! They actually grill the asada meat and its not boiled like the rest of the restaurants that claim to have asada. The tostada was just as good and the food is reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Perfect lunch stop on our road trip from PHX to LA. Had the chilaquiles and the chorizo burrito - service was great and salsas were hot."}
{"text":"I like it a lot. pastor and  carne Asada  burritos are bomb."}
{"text":"Can't say I was real wild about the burrito.

I got an \"all meat\" burrito which was more expensive because I don't like rice/beans in my burrito and that's how they usually make theirs (now I know).

The carne asada itself was salty, not really great quality meat. It was chopped super fine which made it greasier and more mystery meat-ish to me. It was expensive at almost ten bucks because I didn't opt for the cheap filler of beans and rice. Not to mention they dripped some guacamole in it vs actually putting some on it.

Wouldn't go back and definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Only reason I didn't give them 1 star is because at least the dude at the counter seemed cool."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time, because of the high rating.

I decided to compare the California burrito to Senor Taco's version.

The burrito Pancho serves is smaller, but slightly better.  I wasn't very impressed with the carne asada or how they made the burrito.  Maybe burritos are not considered authentic Mexican food?  I don't know.

I'll probably order something different next time.

The horchata I received was also smaller than what Senor Taco offers.  I love horchata and always want A LOT OF IT!

Overall, a decent place.  It is run by nice people who appear to be genuinely concerned about your experience,"}
{"text":"I love authentic Mexican food and it's so hard finding them... This is by far the best Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix"}
{"text":"Omg is all I can say. From the friendly people there to the DELICIOUS, complimentary chips to the food, this place ROCKS!!!"}
{"text":"I concur with everybody who has given Don Pancho 5 stars. This is a fantastic place to eat. I'd drive a hundred miles to be here to enjoy the food. And they were so nice, a rare thing these days in the restaurant industry. LOVE LOVE them!"}
{"text":"My favorite on that side of town so far. Super traditional and salsas are awesome. Love that they give you fried jalapeno with your tacos."}
{"text":"After our mediocre Mexican meal yesterday, hubby looked around for a new restaurant to try.  He stumbled across this place, so we decided to try it out.

It's a small restaurant in a strip mall, but those are usually the best places to get authentic food.  And, this was no exception.  The place was hopping, so we were glad to get a table.  You order at the counter, then they bring you the food.  Everyone working there was so friendly, that's always a plus.

After ordering, we got our drinks and sat down.  A young lady brought over the chips and salsa.  The chips were very good.  Hubby liked the salsa a lot.

A little while later, our food was brought out.  Hubby got the green chili burrito and loved it!  I just had to try the carne asada, again (since yesterday's was a miss).  This was just the way I like it.  The beans were runny and fresh, the rice was flavorful, there were grilled onions on the plate (bonus!) and the meat was delicious and tender.  I also liked that the beans/rice didn't overtake the plate, like they do at some places.  This was the right amount, and it was perfect with my meal.

We also decided to try the flan (yesterday's wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best, either).  This time, the flan just melted in our mouths.  It had that light, airy quality that I associate with a really good flan.

All in all, it was the perfect Mexican meal.  We both enjoyed it immensely, and will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Very, very friendly staff.  Explained all the items to us as it was our first time here.  We loved the food...super delish.  Will come back again, for sure!"}
{"text":"As a Mexican-American (I use the term loosely for I am all white on the inside) my goal in life is to find Mexican restaurants that can fill the void in my life left from the fact that I never learned anything about my heritage or language.  So, like Don Quixote, this is my quest to follow that star no matter how hopeless, no matter how far... My quest has finally ended.  My English-Italian white as snow wife found this restaurant and I was quite skeptical at first until we walked in.  A family enjoying their meal, abuelito in his PJs walking to the salsa bar (the roasted is the best), and the aroma of pure bliss and joy wafting through the air.  Just a few things that first caught our attention.  

The menu is simple, nothing crazy and my favourite part was the ALL DAY BREAKFAST MENU.  YES! ALL DAY BREAKFAST!  My mouth was watering.  We ordered the numbers 4 & 5, pozole (better than my Nana makes!) and a breakfast burrito to split for the next day. Because we are fatties.  To describe the food is to do a disservice to the taste, quality, and flavour that our mouths experienced.  I can only say this...  My only complaint and bitterness towards our Lord Almighty was that He did not create us with two stomachs.  We will be returning with our families in tow!"}
{"text":"One word. Bomb, I'm originally from Cali, I know Mexican food, been to TJ and Ensenada a number of times and the food here compares, family owned and ran, the prices are very reasonable and food is very tasty, would definitely recommend if in the area"}
{"text":"Holy shit this place is awesome! I ha the shrimp quesadilla and there was shrimp in every delicious bite. There salsa is fantastic. My daughter had the chicken burrito and loved it to. Definitely going to be back!"}
{"text":"A small authentic Mexican restaurant with really good service, delicious food, and SUPER cheap/affordable prices! 

Coming from Philly and visiting my bfs family I heard them rave about this place since the summer.  Tacos are $1.50 and meats with a * next to it is extra which is only $2.00-$2.50!!! Coming from Philly this is extremely cheap because our tacos range from $3.5-4.5 there. My steak with rice and beans came with a drink for only $9.99, which would normally be $17.99+ without a drink in Philly. The portions are all very generous, definitely not skimp on the meats at all.

Steak plate- rice and beans were really good, wish there was more. You get the option of chopped or regular steak, I was under the impression that it would be in cut pieces instead of chopped but it was still really delicious! So much meat I couldn't finish. Comes with caramelized onions and a roasted poblano. 

Tacos- the tacos were soooo delicious! So generous on the portions and the steak was my favorite. The grilled fish was very light! Al pastor was great as well. 

Steak nachos- delicious and cheap, only $8 for so much and again, very generous on the meat. 

You order at the cash register and a server brings you your food. It's not full service but the employees are so nice and helpful. Definitely deserves a good tip! Overall 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"After a 7 hour drive to Arizona, this place really hit the spot. I ordered a sope with just beans, cheese, and avocado. It was simply delicious! My friend ordered the chicken enchiladas which came with rice & beans & we both were happy that we came across this place. The staff was very friendly and the interior was Mexican style; super cute! If I ever want authentic Mexican, & I'm in Arizona for whatever reason, I'll forsure stop here!"}
{"text":"Excellent, found our new favorite restaurant. Small and friendly. Authentic and very filling. Better then the restaurants that process their food with salt and ships it to all there locations. Tasted fresh and spicy! Cheesecake was amazing."}
{"text":"The bomb!!!! I ordered a shredded chicken burrito with rice and beans inside my burrito and pico de gallo and this burrito was on fire oh my god it was so good way better than what I expected for an Arizona Mexican food restaurant no offense. I will definitely be back the prices are not bad at all I paid like six bucks for the burrito."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Be prepared for it to be crowded if you go during lunch or dinner. I've eaten here a handful of times and it is consistently awesome food. I would have given it 5 stars but they just raised their prices. I walked out with the carne plate and a drink for $12 today. A little pricy in my book but the food is great. Plus, this place make your burps smell like farts. So you know it's good"}
{"text":"We ordered the enchilada meal and a chile relleno. The meal was good, but I wasn't a fan of the chile relleno drenched in red chile sauce. I have never had a relleno like that and I wouldn't order that again. It was soooo soggy and the sauce over powered the chile relleno."}
{"text":"Great food, My number 1 spot for Mexican food the service is great. They really pride themselves on great Mexican food and I gotta give it to them the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing food!

Everything about this place was great. The service, the food, and the atmosphere. Came here for lunch while working near by, was perfect. 

Can't remember what I got but I know it was good. All three of the guys I were with thought it was amazing too."}
{"text":"We love this place, they have great food and the staff is very friendly. We hired them for a catering order and all of our guest commented on how much they loved the food."}
{"text":"My hubby and I recently moved to the area and this was our first venture out to find authentic Mexican.  I must say that everything was muy delicioso!!  From the horchata to the salsa to the carne asada!  Yum, yum, yum!!  Also, the service was so great!  We highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Great service. Highly recommended. The place is a bit small but I've never had a problem getting a seat. If you can't make up your mind they're always happy to recommend something for you."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had

Tagged this place as an eatery to hit due to its great Yelp scores.  Just visited it and I understand why.  It deserves every star it gets.

I'm normally not a fan of Mexican food and don't know what's truly authentic.  Without exception, I find the cuisine too greasy, cheesy, and bland unless I slather on Tapatio or Cholula.  No longer.

Don Pancho's food is wonderfully flavorful, meats are tender, and it tastes fresh.  Great menu with selections you do not see at Americanized Mexican food eateries.  Service is fast and exceptionally courteous.  Chips and salsas are also good.  And their flan is uber yum.

We will be back to try more of the selections we've never heard of.  I had the beef head tacos and loved them."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices. Kinda small, but doesn't stop us from eating there. Service is great, busy at times, but fast and good service. Great mom and pop restaurant."}
{"text":"Hell yeah!  Super muy tasty.  Don't miss it.  Green chile pork burrito is the bomb.  Thanks for the deliciousness"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the west valley. You have to try the carne asada burrito and shrimp cocktail. Small restaurant but always busy. That should tell you everything you need to know."}
{"text":"I had heard about Don Pancho from a co-worker and have been wanting to try it since seeing the positive ratings on Yelp. We finally gave it a try last week. We were welcomed with a friendly greeting and the guy asked if it was our first time and kindly explained several of the menu items to us. It was very nice. I went with the chicken enchiladas (no garnish) with rice and beans. We also got complimentary chips (which came with beans on top) and tried some of the different options from the salsa bar. It was a pretty good appetizer. I enjoyed my meal, although the beans seemed very watery. Definitely want to come back and try the mini chimis and breakfast burritos!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place; people, food, atmosphere. Everything I've ordered is fantastic and taste homemade. A couple of my favorites are their carnitas burrito and shredded beef tacos."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing for authentic Mexican food in the West Valley! My family and I always come in and the food just seems to get better and better. My favorite is the Asada tacos. The meat is noticeably different from others alike. You can definitely taste the char and the marinated meat. We always rotate our dishes and have NEVER been disappointed. 

Today I had two Carne Asada tacos and a small (not actually so small) bowl of Shrimp Cocktail. The cocktail was to die for and super filling! Tacos were great as expected. 

Our favorite part is that they bring you chips with beans and queso fresco drizzled on top. It's really what makes them extra special because this sets the delicious tone of what's to come! Also, love their salsa bar. All of their salsas are delish and actually spicy! 

As for the service - tonight we were asked by multiple employees how we liked the food and if we needed anything. This is typically how it is when we come in. I feel like they truly care for their customers and the food they serve them! Adore this place."}
{"text":"I love this place! The atmosphere is like home. The food is amazing! They have a salsa bar with everything you need! I went here twice once after seeing the reviews from Siri & my fiancé just came into the country from his military station and he was  craving a carne asada burrito I purchased 4 burritos and 4 tacos it was delicious. Second time I couldn't stop thinking of the taste of the meat it had a smoked taste. I orders at 10a a green chili burrito with beans and rice and a carne asada taco. On the side they even put a roasted pepper and onions yummy. Loved it thumbs up!"}
{"text":"They had a long list of soups and offered me samples. The brought out two bowls with all the fixings! Both samples were delicious but I chose the Birria. My fiance had the chilaquelas and a Cuban torta which he said were delicious and ate it all. Portions were big and the staff were very nice and accommodating. They even brought us out samples of their red and green Chile! We were happy with our first visit here and will be back."}
{"text":"I got a sliced steak thing with jalapeños and onions and tomatoes I would not order again.. but my wife's red chili chili with enchiladas sauce was awesome. Their enchilada sauce was some of the best I have had"}
{"text":"Delicious home made food.  Great lunch combos only 6.49 with a drink.  Come here twice a week"}
{"text":"My hubby and I and our friend, Juan, love this place! The chile rellenos are my favorite. The chile is tender and loaded with cheese and great sauce on top. My hubby and friend have a new favorite in the Cubano Torta. Also have enjoyed the cheap tacos, enchiladas and burritos. Soooo happy to find a true mom and pop Mexican food place that is authentic."}
{"text":"We have tried so many Mexican restaurants here in the valley and hands down thee best. The flavor of the food is so good and you can taste the quality of the food. This place is a must when you're craving good Mexican food. From the beans to the sopas, you won't  be disappointed."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa to start were amazing!! Service is excellent. Everyone was so friendly. Had carne asada tacos and pastor tacos. Delicious!!  Totally authentic. Must try."}
{"text":"The only reason for the four stars is because the place is a bit small. The food, however, is excellent! Not very pricey and you get a lot of food for your money. Try the carne asada!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed after seeing such great reviews.
Ordered the cheese enchiladas plate for $9.99,
Thought ok it's a good price. But immediately regretted it after taking a bite. The sauce is horrible and the rice was awful. The only thing that was good were the beans.
My wife ordered a asada quesadilla, which was surprisingly good. So we shared the quesadilla and the beans. I don't like to complain so I didn't say anything to management.
I think you can get better enchiladas at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Excellent homemade Mexican food! If you want authentic this is the place to be. The red chile enchiladas are out of this world. The sauce is too die for and tastes like it was simmering for hours with red chili peppers. I also love how thy give you a complimentary bowl of chips with beans and cheese with salsa when you arrive. My kids love this! Everything I've ordered from here has been delicious. Their crunchy beef tacos have tons of flavor along with theo carne asada burritos. We love coming here. I just wish it was bigger. The place is so small and always crowded."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did! I've eaten here maybe 5 times in the past week already. The carne asada street tacos are the bomb.com and the rice is really flavorful too. I love that there is a salsa bar with a few different types of salsas and some veggies and peppers as well. The service has been really friendly and the restaurant is very clean. It's also pretty affordable and there are several different specials as well. This is my new spot for good tacos."}
{"text":"We went to Don Pancho for breakfast and it was delicious. We had huevos rancheros and chilaquiles and both tasted so good. 

The vibe inside is nice and the staff is friendly. 

We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The beef enchiladas were to die for! Their salsa bar has enough sauces to keep me going through basket after basket of chips. 

My fiancé had the burrito with red and green sauce which was delicious as well. 

Friendly staff, great prices and fantastic food; I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Food was great and the staff was very friendly. The place is small & can get packed quickly. But that wouldn't stop me nor should it stop you if you want good Mexican food. I'm only in AZ for a few more days and already planning my next trip! EXCELENTE!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for an early lunch. The place was empty when we arrived but by the time we left all of the tables were full and that was well before lunch. Shortly after we ordered we were brought chips that had a small amount of  beans on them. They were good. I ordered the carnitas street tacos and my son had the green chile burrito. Everything was really tasty. I especially enjoyed the salsa that was brought out with the chips. There was a salsa bar with several other choices as well that I would like to try on our next visit."}
{"text":"Food here is authentic and amazing. Had the taco plate. Prices are great would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"A very pleasant surprise - Great hot, flavorful fool, made to order.  Very clean restaurant, and personalized service.    My 2 kids say they could eat here every day! :)."}
{"text":"Food was AMAZING!!! Yelp helped us find this delicious and authentic restaurant! Can't wait to visit it again!!"}
{"text":"Really, really good! Seems authentic and made with love. I had the chicken quesadilla - the shredded chicken really gave it a lot of flavor. I normally can't finish a whole quesadilla but this one was so delicious I had to! Small restaurant with a few tables. Nice atmosphere. Great food at a great price. Friendly staff. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with a friend and thought the food was really good. I had a chicken enchilada and a chorizo taco. Both were excellent. An added bonus since we were eating in was a basket of fresh chips (covered in received beans and cheese) with salsa. I will definitely be going back with my family."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great place, everything is homemade and authentic. We are from out of town and wish we had a place like Don Pancho's at home!"}
{"text":"We got tacos de tripa and asada. They were delicious! The horchata was great as well as the Jamaica water. I don't know that they are the best tacos I ever had like some other reviews claim but they are pretty high up there. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious. Doesn't look like much on the surface, but my party had a variety of dishes and nothing was less than stellar. The sopes are the best I've ever had, and the corn quesadillas were crispy and perfect."}
{"text":"We found this location with the help of yelp. Hubby and I have been looking for a mexican restaurant that wasn't too American. Anyways this place was amazing for our first time. We went to eat breakfast and i had chilaquiles verdes which came with 2 eggs, beans and rice. And let me tell you they were delicious and spicy. I love spicy but this made my tummy burn. My hubby order a chimiganga with carne asada which came with beans and rice. His plate was huge we paid a little over $20 and it was perfect!  Definitely will come back and recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is a tasty well-kept secret in Avondale. It is delicious. Everything we've tried is very good. My favorite are the chicken tacos - I don't know what they do to the chicken, but it is a perfect blend of marinade and fajita-like juices. Their soups are also very good - menudo, caldo de res, etc. The owners and staff are so sweet!"}
{"text":"Great little Mexican place that I had been wanting to try because of all the great reviews, the thing that brought me in finally is I ended up really loving one of their salsas they entered in a contest during the Old Avondale Fiesta. It was settled...we had to try this place the very next day. Food was good, they have a lot of variety, salsa bar, lots of yummy drinks to choose from, clean facility, and the staff was super friendly. 

I just wish you could get more chips with your meal and there was nothing on the menu about buying extra on the side. 
Finally the only reason I deducted a star was the whole reason I came here in the first place, because I loved the salsa! They only give you one extra small container with your chips and that's it. I was more than happy to buy some more and take it to-go but unfortunately was told that once they put it in the little containers they have no way of selling it to me and I would have to wait 3days for them to make it again and hopefully catch them before they put it in the containers, then I would be able to buy it. Bummer!! It's so hard finding good salsa and you're telling me there is no way to sell it to me?! I don't care if you have to give me a ton of little containers, was really looking forward to taking some home :("}
{"text":"I went here last night with a couple of friends and all I can say is that it is authentic mexican food! I had the chimmi and it was amazing! To top it all of, the customer service was perfect. Seemed like a family owned restaurant from the friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and service. I've been here more than a few times, and always the same great food and service. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Mexican food and great customer service! Definitely coming here again when we visit AZ."}
