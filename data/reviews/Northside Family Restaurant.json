{"text":"Wonderful restaurant for easy lunch with kids. We stopped in after several years away, and it is the perfect family run diner with very reasonable prices. Like having lunch in a small town."}
{"text":"After driving by the NFR nearly every day for months, I finally decided to check it out for breakfast recently following an overnight work shift. It resides in a mini-mall setting on N. Sherman Ave, has a family diner vibe that matches its name, and seems to be popular with seniors. 
  I was kind of expecting an independent version of IHOP or Denny's, and wasn't too far off the mark. When I asked the waitress if they had blueberry pancakes, which weren't on the menu, she hesitated for a second and then said, \"Sure. Sure.\" And sure enough, I got a stack of 3 plain pancakes under a mound of blueberry glop. Guess the cook figured you can always convert ordinary pancakes to the blueberry version by dumping a can (or was it two?) of pie filling on top. 
  The rest of the food was similarly uninspired, but the waitresses were friendly and hit me up with coffee refills every few minutes. And I don't want to sound too snarky - I think every neighborhood should have a low-budget diner, especially if it's open 24 hours (not so here). I may or may not give it a go for dinner one of these days, though I expect (from the \"bucket of fried fish\" special) that there's more of an emphasis on quantity than quality."}
{"text":"We got our taxes done at h&r block so we thought we sound get some food at a local restayrant, Bad choice. Worst meatloaf I've ever had.  Looked like it was some old dog food sliced to look like meat loaf. Wait staff was ok, not good. My wife thought her burger was ok. We went there a while ago so it isn't fresh in my mind. Haven't gone back. This place is a skip."}
{"text":"I am unbelievably disappointed in the service I had today. I ordered my food to go. Specifically asked for ranch on the side and for my meal to come with french fries. I picked it up and headed home. I open the to go box to find no french fries and the side of ranch cup filled 1/4 of the way, and I had to pay extra for it. I called and asked to speak with the manager. After 2 minutes on hold I was hung up on. I called back only to have the rudest manager tell me that I hung up on them. She continued to speak to me with a negative attitude in her tone about how I messed up the ordering of the meal and that she usually checks the boxes but didn't check mine. She also noted that she knew there was ranch on my wrap and just gave me a side in addition. She KNEW there was ranch on it and didn't have it remade!!!!! That is terrible service. I'm not expecting a 5 star experience at a place like this but this was a 1 star at best. On top of that she was unable to do anything for me to reconcile the situation, so all I asked of her was to do better next time so no one else has this problem and then has to deal with this TERRIBLE customer service."}

   The wattage on the smile of the Server I first encountered pleasantly reeled me in.

{"text":"My wife and I love this place for date night with as cozy a feel as being at home in a family atmosphere the fish fry is great and wine is free with all you can eat on Friday night! We would give more than five stars if that was possible."}
{"text":"This the perfect restaurant for mediocre diner style food. My extended family and I use to eat here almost every Sunday morning for breakfast. The food was pretty bad, but the service was ok. I don't know why, but we kept going. At first it was out of convenience because we live in the area, but then it turned into almost a game. Each and every time we went someone in the group either got the wrong food, part of their food, none of their food, doubles of this or that, etc. The list goes on and on. We almost always had a reservation and usually had between 4-8 people. The wait staff did a pretty good job of keeping up, but when the food is consistently wrong, it makes their job pretty tough. It can't be easy either. They probably have 100 items on their menu. There is no way a cook can be good at making everything well. I think they've set themselves up for failure. Go here if you don't care if what you eat isn't what you ordered. P. S. Be sure they charge you only for what you get because they're sure to miss something."}
{"text":"Slow service after being ignored by waitstaff. Got the Tuna Melt but not the soup or salad that comes with it. Stale bread/toast. Table next to us knew people so they had 3 servers for 12 people yet we barely got half a server."}
{"text":"Not exactly sure why I am not giving this place only 1 star.  Just got back from having a late breakfast with a friend of mine.  This is the first time and last time I am going to this place.  Where do I begin...?

Okay, I will start by saying UGH!  The place is drab looking for starters, definitely needs a facelift.  Service is lousy.  The food was God awful!  My scrambled eggs were hard and rubbery.  The veggies in my skillet tasted like they came from a frozen bag and were left in the freezer for the last 2 years.  The hash browns weren't bad but that was the only saving grace. The server was uncomfortable and unsure of himself.  He wasn't new as my friend pointed out that he has waited on her before.  When he came with the creamers for our table he had them scrunched up against his waist and were falling out out his hands when bringing it to our table.  Bad, bad, bad. He was also sweating and was using his hand to wipe his forehead.  Yes, you may turn and barf now.  For some reason the toast wasn't ready when the rest of the food was, and we had to flag him down after almost 10 minutes to get our toast.  The coffee cup they gave me had lipstick marks on it.  Gross.  As for the coffee, which is always something I pay attention to...was rock bottom priced coffee.  Terrible.

True, the place is inexpensive but there are other places in Madison that offer better service and quality of food for the price.  Avoid this place like the plague."}
