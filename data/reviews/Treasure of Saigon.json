{"text":"Alrighty...so I'm Vietnamese and for me to give a high rating for Vietnamese restaurant is a mighty challenge in itself.

If I end my meal with out drinking all the broth (for Pho) or throwing back the shot of fish sauce then it's not high on my list.  

This place is close to home and we didn't feel like putting on our kevlar to head over to my fav Vietnamese restaurant. 

Got seated right away, but took a bit for our order to be taken.  I make it a point to order in Vietnamese with hopes they prep the dish with a little bit more of an authentic touch.  Call me crazy but that's how my mind works. 

For the food, we ordered the lemon grass pork on rice which came with two spring rolls and fried egg.  One large pho sate chicken and also one large pho sate beef.

The rice dish, is ok.  I don't know how to explain it, nothing stood out to me and screamed eat me!  It wasn't bad, just ok..

The pho sate, I honestly believe they just used the regular broth and added the sate hot sauce to it afterwards and in my humble option that's a no no.  

I love pho sate when the broth is specifically made with the intent to be sate, my absolute fav is the sate that has a strong peanut flavour to it.  Unfortunately this wasn't that.

Again it was alright.  Next time I get a craving from the motherland, I'll make the trek across town.

Oh, and no complementary hot tea, what!?"}
{"text":"Very small portions! I've had food from here both dine in and take out. Every time I order take out the portions are half of what you get when you dine in the restaurant. The food itself isn't anything special. The grilled chicken on the vermicelli never tastes/looks fresh. The viet subs are just ok. There are far better Vietnamese restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Last time I was there I got a looooong black hair in my sub. Never, ever going back."}
{"text":"Great food, good service and very affordable. Love the shrimp salad rolls and Tiger beer!"}
{"text":"This is a truly great community restaurant. The food is reasonably priced and really tasty. Of course some things are better than others, but I find that the lemongrass chicken with rice, lemongrass salmon with coconut rice and chicken sub are consistently good. The staff are also very friendly and the atmosphere is comfortable. Treasure of Saigon is truly a \"treasure\" of the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Good phone spot. Been there plenty of times and never had a bad experience. Spring rolls are great. Not sure why there's so many salty reviews."}

From all the following reviews,  sounds like a completely different place!

While pet sitting by Old Banff Coach Rd, I noticed the restaurant in the corner of a distance and thought hey, that places sounds good.... I ordered both times for takeaway.

The first time I ordered A veggie roll, Mixed Vegetable Curry on rice.... if you haven't figured out now - I don't eat meat- The price was reasonable it came to $15.55. The Curry was mildly spicy with alot of Lemon Grass that over powered the entire dish. At first I was picking at it wondering... \"what is that?\".

The Veggie roll is best described as: Gross. It was wrapped with a day old rice paper (kinda crusty) and vermicelli, leaf lettuce (going brown) and dried carrots. It should have been called leftover roll with too much vermicelli.

The 2nd time I ordered I was craving soup... something warm and hearty. The weather was crummy... so it only seemed appropriative. I enter the restaurant this time instead of placing a call. It was empty (no surprise) and dark. I asked for a takeaway menu, she looked confused... oh gosh I hope she understands English (I thought). While reviewing the menu it was over jammed with Beef, Pork and more beef as the meat selection. When I asked her were the vegetarian options were, she yammed \"On the back\". With only 6 items to choose from Soup was NOT anywhere to be found. Worse was her and her husband standing over me.. expecting me to order or leave! When I asked if their was a NO MEAT soup option (keeping my wording to layman terms) she nodded frustratingly and yelled... \"no you want beef or pork?\"  

After pointlessly talking back and forth for a good 5 minutes, I found #34 offered beef broth with no meat. That's all I wanted yet she insisted they did not do veggie soups. Grumbling and rethinking my choice to waste money on this I paid $7.50 for the meal expecting better results compared to the first experience.

I wasted some time by getting a lottery ticket at 7/11 and returned famished to my order just sitting on a table. 2 containers for 1 dish? Odd! As I opened the first container It was just broth. The 2nd container had cold Vermcelli with raw veggies on-top. I Was stunned. \"Is this make a soup?\" seriously nothings cooked, they've just given me the food to make it myself.  

What the point? I might aswell have went to the market and made the soup myself... which by the way would have tasted better!  The soup was bland, and I had to REALLY MICROWAVE  the heck out of my meal.... it was yet another fail.

NEVER GOING BACK!"}
{"text":"This is our go to Pho place and it's always good and hot! 
The service is lacking - I never can tell if they remember me or not (kind of that awkward feeling when you don't know if you sound like a broken record or they think you are odd? lol) It really is delicious though~! They are only open until 9pm too - just a note."}
{"text":"I went to Treasure of Saigon on my dinner break around 8 on Saturday and I gotta say I didn't \"get\" the service. 

Like, I don't know if the waitress' jokes/personality was going over my head, or if she was actually just a bit weird. 

The night started off with her greeting us by saying \"oh, you're here again\"-- in a very dry, straight-faced manner. We chuckled it off and she proceeded taking our orders. I had the veggie spring rolls and a veggie sub, she wrote it down and then looked at me and asked if I was Muslim. I said \"no\" and she carried on with taking the rest of my co-worker's orders. See? That's weird, right?

Overall, the service was a bit odd and a bit slow too. The restaurant wasn't that busy. We had to go to the counter to get someone to grab our bills. But the food was really good and filling. My sub lasted me for two meals and the veggie spring rolls were really great."}
{"text":"Awesome vietnamese subs, I wasn't as wowed by their beef noodle soup.  Excellent spring rolls!"}
{"text":"Best pho in the area. Great service, good food. They don't add a bunch of MSG like other pho restaurants do to their beef noodle soups. Recommend!"}
