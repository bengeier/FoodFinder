{"text":"Surprisingly find this little niche on the Murray! Exotic, delicious, hygiene, and the staff are super super nice! They also have coffee shop, I will hide here for the rest of my winter break!"}
{"text":"The Crepes are delicious,  inside is pleasant, the staff are friendly, a little bit slow when no customers there, and price a bit high, but quality is great."}
{"text":"I had the matcha azuki crepe and friends had several fruit ones.  The taste and flavor combination of mine were different from those of \"traditional\" crepes in a good, interesting way!"}
{"text":"So happy T-Swirl Crepe came to Pittsburgh. I had the berry crepe and Thai chicken crepe. Both were amazing and very filling. Definitely coming back for more in near future!"}
{"text":"I've been to the store in Philly but I came to this location just yesterday and had such a positive review, I couldn't help but give his place 5 stars!

The moment my friend and I walked in, the staff greeted us warmly and helped us readily, unasked. They provided for us menus and were very patient in waiting on our order.

My friend and I shared two crepes: one sweet and one savory.

The Chocolate Nut Party was AMAZING! The gelato is so rich and chocolatey. If you're a chocolate lover and you enjoy ice cream, you HAVE to get this one! Not only was it delicious, it was pleasant to look at too.

The chicken teriyaki was much better than I anticipated. It was filling but tasted light and healthy. The produce was fresh and it was definitely made with care. The sauce is incredibly yummy too.

The interior is humble but pretty. It's simple in its design but the dark wood gives a sleek & clean yet homey feel to the place. It's very inviting! There are outlets as well!

I'd come here again! The crepes are the perfect size! Very worth!"}
{"text":"Found this newly open place on Saturday, such a big surprise! We ordered wild berries and matcha strawberries. Their crepes are very exquisitely made and they taste so good! It's very nice they have some crepes offered in mini size. Will definitely go here again for an afternoon tea or a snack."}
{"text":"Got the Matcha Azuki Bean crepe, which was pretty darn good. Nice, crispy crepe in a beautiful arrangement - it really does look like the photos in the menu. If I were being picky, I'd say I wish the matcha gelato had a stronger matcha flavour.

Speaking of wishing for stronger flavours, I also had the Earl Grey Black Tea Latte (hot). Since it's a latte I guess you can't expect as much tea flavour, but maybe some adjustment with the amount of milk could help.

The lady who took my order called it \"Early\" Grey Tea, so cute. Will probably go back again, try their savoury crepes or maybe another type of drink."}
{"text":"Quick Review: A tasty welcome addition Squirrel Hill, though things seemed a little disorganized. 

More Information: I was really pumped when I saw that a walking crepe restaurant was opening in Squirrel Hill. I had a favorite crepe place in Berkeley and couldn't find anything like it here. (And wow. That last sentence about Berkeley and crepes might be the bougiest thing I have ever typed). 

I ordered the strawberry creme brulee crepe. The crepe itself was delicate with a slight sweetness. This was a perfect match for the custard and strawberry filling - which was nicely toasted with the torch. 

I will say that the employees seemed a bit overwhelmed when I ordered this, though it was soon after the store opened - so it may have been general nervousness."}
{"text":"Interesting and delicious concept. Great flavors and lots of choices. A little challenging to eat at times, but still worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was eyeing this for a long time awaiting its opening. We finally made our way here on a weeknight and it wasn't too busy.

MANGO RASPBERRIES ($5.50 mini): What a great first pick! I wanted to get something with lots of fruits that wasn't the T-Swirl Fruits Cocktail fruit overload (will have to try next time) because I wanted a mini.
MATCHA CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES ($7.75 regular): Kinda too chocolate-y for my tastes, but my boyfriend really liked it. The matcha cream was actually really yummy but I also thought the amount may have been overpowering.

It's located in a pretty convenient place within Squirrel Hill so it's a good place to go after dessert. There is also some seating places, and the place wasn't very loud or crowded when I went so it seems to be a good place to talk and hangout as well.

I've never eaten the savory crepes here before, but if you are coming here for dessert the smaller size is probably enough just to get a taste. There seems to be many different options on the menu that all look very appealing, so I would definitely be open to coming here with friends to try them out!"}
{"text":"Tastes great! I wish Boston would have something like this. It's a chain store that has so many branches in NYC, but not in Boston yet. Anyways, if you are in town and is craving for a crepe, come taste these! They will not let you down!"}
{"text":"My roommates decided to try this place out after no other food seemed appetizing.  We walked down to it, marveled at the window filling plastic displays of the real food they serve, and then entered. Immediately we noticed there was a line, and everyone who had ordered was sitting at the long bench in front of the counter. 

Having seen the online menu, we were a little sad to see the menu at this location looked shorter from the physical menu list on the ordering counter.  However, their TVs display the full menu, so make sure to check it out for the full array of options!

Two of us got the Spicy Crab Crepe, one of us got the Shrimp Avocado.  It was about $9 per crepe. 
We sat on the bench and watched the two people constructing our food, which was neat, but explains the wait. We decided to get a table, but upon seeing all the free tables, I noticed they were mostly covered in trash left by patrons who didn't throw their crepe wrappers/free clear water cups away. It was clear the patrons hadn't done this because the trash bin by the main door was too full-- no one had cleaned it in a while! 

Nevertheless, I cleaned the table of trash, and we sat and enjoyed our meal.  All our crepes were tasty, but between the spicy crab and shrimp avocado, the Shrimp Avocado crepe won. 

The real star of the show was the dessert. We shared a $9 crepe called the Lychee Romantic, which had lychee fruit bits, rose flavored cream, raspberries, and pistachios for crunch.  It was so good, I could have eaten ten."}
{"text":"Grab and go crepe! The package is well designed so i didn't get Nutella everywhere. Banana and Nutella was only like $6. There are also many other choices, sweet and savory. Coffee, tea, and intern drinks. Not many tables but definitely a happy place to stop by on Murray."}
{"text":"Although I'm Japanese, I've always thought that I wasn't a big fan of Japanese crepes.  Too many that I've tried have been filled with extraneous amounts of whipped cream and wrapped in too soft of a skin for my personal taste. Not this place!

I tried the mango and raspberries, smoked salmon, and the chocolate nut party crepes. I was worried that the mango and raspberries one was going to be too sweet for me, but was pleasantly surprised when it was perfect in terms of sweetness. What surprised me even more on my first bite was the crispiness of the crepe! While retaining the pros of being soft and chewy that comes from using rice flour, the crepe retained it's form and crispiness throughout me eating it. I'm usually a sucker for raspberries so it wasn't a surprise that I enjoyed that part, but I was relieved when I found that the mangos were ripe (I've had experiences at froyo places where their mangos are crunchy and lacking in flavor). The smoked salmon one was reminiscent of a salad, and had some crunchy texture which matched well. Finally the chocolate nut one was quite obviously sweet, but my friend enjoyed it a lot.

I think T-Swirl is a good place for a light meal or snack, and I appreciate that some of the sweet crepes come in a mini and regular size. Next time I'd also like to try their drinks and their Creme Brulee crepe!"}
{"text":"The place is nice. Crepe is gooooooood! Soft and crispy at the same time. The yoghurt sauce is outstanding. The service is a bit slow, but for those crepes, it worth it."}
{"text":"So I stopped here on a random evening to give it a try.  The place looked clean, but smelled a bit (crab or some ingredient maybe?)   The smell sort of turned me off of the savory that I originally came in for, so I went for dessert.   After much debate, I settled on the chocolate banana.  

The finished crepes do actually look pretty close to the samples in the window.  I thought it was going to be hard to eat, but there is a sleeve that holds it all together - I just picked it up and pushed it out of the sleeve as I ate.  Overall, it was really good.  I'd definitely try another one.  Hopefully the smell was a one time thing."}
{"text":"This is a delightful place to come have a snack or a meal..
basically its a crepe sammie 
warmly greeted my few visits
They have savory crepes such as short ribs and egg filled
and my favorite the smoked salmon 
its like what you put on a bagel but served in a fresh crepe
what could be better! I love it 
they also offer dessert type crepes filled with custard and all sorts of fruit
Ive had the fuji apple a lovely mix of thin sliced apples and very yum custard
I love custard 
you do crepes as sit and stay there are a few tables 
or you can carry out. the way the crepes are nestled into their paper wraps makes for clean easy eating 
they also offer iced tea and coffees 
I have had their iced chair tea its really nice n  with the right about of spicy.
cute window with faux crepes so you see their wares
love the extra touch of Pokey sticks in the dessert crepes
great little spot"}
{"text":"So excited about this crepe place in squirrel hill! This was my first time trying Japanese style crepes and I am in love!! I was a little apprehensive about doing a crepe take out as I thought the crepe would be a mess but i was impressed the way crepes were packed. My husband and I tried the BLT crepe and the mango raspberry crepe. Both the crepes were really delicious even though they were a bit cold since we got them packed. Our plan was to eat them at home but we couldn't stop after taking few bites in the car, they were gone in 60 seconds flat!"}
{"text":"Uhm, I'm blown away. I came here on a whim because Millie's ran out of ice cream, and I still cannot believe how amazing this crepe tasted. I ordered the mini strawberry banana crepe which had cream, yogurt and chocolate pearls (seriously..what!!). Only took a few minutes to make and there was some serious concentration that went into it. I paid, left and went to my car. Was going to have a bite and drive down the street to a friends, but when I had that first bite, I literally couldn't stop eating it. Flavor explosion!! The crepe was rich and fluffy (yet still thin), perfect amount of bananas and strawberries, the cream had a very light sweetness, and the yogurt added the \"thing\" that MADE this crepe so incredible. It was unsweetened yogurt as far as I could tell, and the tangy flavor paired so perfectly. Then of course the chocolate pearls in every other bite added just the slightest bit of depth. 

I could probably write forever about how much I loved it. I hadn't gone before because I heard they could be a little expensive, but I now in no way care in the slightest. Completely worth the price. (Mine was $5 anyway, not exactly breaking the bank)"}
{"text":"Love this place, had both sweet crepe and non-sweet crepes.  Both were perfect. 

Really like Shrimp Avocado and Smoked Salmon.  good for lunch.

Also like the crepe burlee, I would add that as dessert every time.

Love their hours too, finally a place for some late(r) night dessert."}
{"text":"A wonderful place for fresh, yummy crepes! I ordered one with multiple fruits and whipped yogurt. The fruits are very fresh, the crepe fits my teeth, and best of all, it's not too sweet that you feel fed up eating it! Will definitely visit again and try some other savors."}
{"text":"We came in as a group for my nieces' birthday. The service was friendly and the crepes were delicious. I will definitely be coming back to try more flavors. I asked them a lot of questions about the ingredients and they were very willing to provide any information  asked for. They even showed me the ingredient labels for the sauces. When I asked for my shrimp crepe to be made without the sauces they had no problem accommodating me. By the way I loved the shrimp crepe without the sauce and will order it again."}
{"text":"We came here with five people, and ordered five different main courses and two different desserts. Everything was fresh and well-prepared.

I had the Thai chicken and loved it, I also tasted the teriyaki chicken which was excellent too. We had two vegetarians that ordered dishes jwithout the meat and substituted an egg and they both came out really well too. 

For the dessert crepes we had one fruit and one matcha both were absolutely excellent!

Service was friendly and accommodating and the decor was nice, the music was a little too loud for us but I guess that's a matter of taste

I would definitely come back..."}
{"text":"The crepes at this location as well as their Philly location are delicious!!! Extremely tasty!"}
{"text":"OVERALL: taste is a 3.5, presentation is a 4.5. Would come again. 

T-Swirl is a cute little store in squirrel hill with a good selection of both sweet and savory crepes. I've only had the sweet crepes so far, but I'd be down to go away and try a savory option. The sweet crepes are pretty good - the presentation is cute and definitely picture worthy, and they load it with toppings. The fruit is also fresh, which is a big plus. The taste of the crepes could be improved though. It seems like a lot of flavors are mixed together, which can make it a bit overwhelming. I'm not a fan of the matcha filling they put inside - it seems a little cheap. However, the matcha ice cream was great. 

One of my qualms is that the crepes are hard to eat, especially if it has a lot of filling in them. It's an innovative design - just not super practical. I'd still prefer crepes on the plate with a fork and knife."}
{"text":"I've tried their location in Philly too. That was the first time I've had a decorated crepe and I was stunned. A few years later and many crepes down the road I've come to visit their newly opened Pittsburgh location. And it has not kept up with crepe standards 

I got the matcha azuki crepe for around $9 with tax to share with my friend. We waited around 15 minutes on a Saturday night to get our order and immediately snatched an empty table when we could. I wished they would add more counters or tables to account for large crowds but I can also see how they aim to preserve the aesthetic and spaciousness.

The crepe itself was crispy at the top. The matcha ice cream was not too bitter. As we got deeper into the crepe, the less ice cream there was and the more cream filling became pertinent. The crepe was mostly soft and delicate. I wish they could've preserved the crispness of the crepe to contrast the smooth cream. Maybe cooking the crepe for longer would've improved it's texture. 

Overall it was a mediocre crepe, nothing too outstanding. It's a bit overpriced, more like a meal than a snack. It's not a place I'd go out of my way to visit, but I would stop by occasionally."}
{"text":"Finally a (dessert) crepe place in Pittsburgh!! 

I came with a friend around 8PM and it wasn't busy at all. The workers greeted us as soon as we walked through the door. I observed that they did that with all the customers! The place looks like a nice place to hang out!

We ordered the MATCHA CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE CREPE and it was $8.29 for a regular size. It was very tasty and pretty sweet but I would've preferred it to have more stuff on the inside. I noticed that most of the stuff was on the exterior of the crepe and not much on the inside. And this crepe was a bit more on the sweet side though. Honestly I feel like the price isn't really worth what you get, but it's still a good tasting crepe. 

I would definitely come back and try more of their flavors!

{"text":"I am so excited that we finally have one of these, I made a stop at their NYC locations every time I was in town, and now we have one right down the street!!  My favorite is litchi romantic"}
{"text":"Nice place, has some interesting food. There is limited seating, so my bf and I sat in the high bar top after the registers. Smelled really odd of sewage and made me feel sick all day. The food itself was great though. We shared a sweet crepe and it was amazing. If I go again I'll probably just order to go."}
{"text":"Casual setting with good Japanese-style crepes. Tasty food and pretty presentation.

T-Swirl offers a selection of sweet and savory crepes, which you order then pick up after they've finished making it in front of you. 

I had the Blueberry Cheesecake crepe, which was very sweet and very rich, but still good. I expected it to be difficult to eat, but it turned out to be pretty easy with a sleeve holding it all together. The crepe was still crunchy and warm when I ate it, and toppings were pretty evenly spread throughout the crepe (so you aren't eating mouthfuls of toppings in one bite, and just plain crepe in another). It felt like I was eating an ice cream cone, except with a softer, more decadent cone. The regular-sized crepe was very filling and I was struggling to finish it by the end."}
{"text":"The lychee and raspberry crepe is sooooo good. They were out of the rose custard that it usually comes with, but it was still delicious. They have a wide variety of crepes from savory to sweet. I really like that there is a glass section that you can watch them make your crepe in. I thought that all of the toppings in the crepe I got matched well with each other but I wish they put a little more of the fillings/toppings in the the crepe. I would definitely come back to try a different kind of crepe because they all sound super good!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were driving through Squirrel Hill last month when we first noticed T-Swirl and decided to check it out a couple days later. We went during their grand opening week, which was just before the new year. 

They had a mix of sweet and savory crepes and pretty good options overall. I got the Lychee Romantic crepe (lychees, raspberries, rose custard cream, whipped yogurt, pistachio) and my boyfriend got the NY Blueberry Cheesecake crepe (blueberries, whipped cream, whipped yogurt, vanilla ice cream, chocolate Pocky). We enjoyed them for the most part, but I was a little disappointed with my Lychee Romantic because the ingredients didn't work as well together as I thought. In addition to our crepes, we also shared an earl grey milk tea that was really good. 

They had a display of all of their crepe offerings in the front window, which was pretty cool. The ambience was also really nice (dim lighting with wood and brick walls). Great addition to Squirrel Hill!

{"text":"This place is defenitly not worth. 

Bad service, unprofessional, slow, quit expensive. They should of done it better since \"Crepe\" itself is a good business.

I was standing there waiting for my crepe and bubble tea, and theres exact same order came oyt and i thougbt it was mine and looked at her but the girl said \"No. That's not yours\" way she speaks make me really awkward. 

Suddenly my crepe came out and i asked a holder, which every table had, she said \"No. You need to pay\" not even asked me before I order my food and didnt tell me how much i need to pay for it.

All the workers were unprofessional. 
You can def see they just want to go home. No smiling, no word other then price of the food. 
Only one girl there seems extremely happy. Jumping around, high fiving people who were making food. 

I can tell they are young. But i bet they learned those basic customer services while training."}
{"text":"This chain has finally made it's debut in Pittsburgh. The concept is similar to 15 Fahrenheit which, by the way is opening a 2nd location on this same street a few doors down in the spring.

You can choose from sandwich style crepes to dessert ones. Only the dessert ones come in two sizes. They also have their crepes of the day which are usually breakfast ones. A person behind the counter told me that they try to carry one vegetarian one every day. in the front window they have \"models\" of finished crepes so you get an idea of what they look like.

These are called \"rice\" crepes so I decided to order a chicken teriyaki filled crepe and water. They have a pitcher which you can pour the water from but let me tell you it does leak on the counter when you try to pour it.

I watched as they made my crepe since it wasn't busy. Like a salad bar they have all the ingredients needed to make your selection. They fill one side of it and then wrap it and stick it into a \"cone\" style holder for you to eat. There are tear away sections of the cone so you can continue working your way through it.

I thought it was good but not overwhelmingly spectacular. It was indeed filling however so I didn't bother with a dessert one. There is a small dining area in front and a long bar with chairs as you head towards the back. My crepe was just under $10.00. I felt like this is just a different concept as opposed to going to a restaurant or eatery known for crepes and having them fresh and sometimes heated.

The place is located on Murray Ave near Forbes in Squirrel Hill where parking can be quite a problem depending when you go. The crepe isn't overly messy which I will give in its favor."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! I got the chocolate truffle and the banana nut party. Both were very good and i like the unique concept of the crepe and ingredients in an easy to eat cone"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to T-Swirl and it did not disappoint. The crepes are very crispy and they have really delicious flavors. I had the banana chocolate crepe which was pretty good--the truffles were delicious--but it was a little too sweet for my taste. My friend had the wild berry crepe and she really enjoyed the yogurt filling.

We went on a Friday night at around 9:30 and couldn't find any seats. We ended up just eating on the benches on the side. There were others eating on the bench as well. Seating overall is a little sparse.

If you're looking for a sweet night snack, this is a good place to try!"}
{"text":"I love T-Swirl! This is not the first time I had it before, I tried it at Philadelphia couple years ago. I literally told my girlfriend we need one of this in Pittsburgh. And couple years later, my wish came true :). So happy there is one opened here in Pittsburgh, and YUP it is still as good as I remembered it. I came here with my friends and none of us can decide what we wanted. Especially for the sweet crepes, they all look so delicious. I ended up getting the cocktail crepes with a little bit of modification. I asked to have matcha custard instead of the regular custard. 
My two friends got savory ones, they both picked spicy crab crepes. And the other two they got sweet, they all enjoyed their crepes. 
I had to bring home one for my boyfriend because I wanted to him to try it. He got the NY cheesecake one, and he also loves it. Oh man, as I'm writing this review, I'm drooling . Anyway, go try it if you haven't."}
{"text":"Come to this place for great tasting crepes. I've had only the sweet variety, so I can only speak to the quality of those. The lychee one was especially good, I highly recommended it. The Nutella-banana combo is always a classic and the mango one is solid as well. The service is great and the workers are friendly, always greeting you with a smile. The only downside is the price. It's a little high for the quantity of food you get."}
{"text":"I've walked past this place several times, so I was very excited to finally check it out! The inside is nicely furnished, and on a Saturday evening we had no trouble finding seats after ordering.

We tried the brûlée crepe with bananas and with lychee. I've never seen a brûlée crepe before. It 
was actually very much creme brûlée: custard mixed with fruit as filling in the crepe, and topped with burnt sugar.  The burnt sugar was my favorite part. I'd like to go back and try their savory crepes!"}
