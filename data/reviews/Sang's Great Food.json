{"text":"Big portions, delicious cheep Chinese food.

This isn't 5 star - but the potions are big and the food is tasty. New go-to UberEATS Chinese!"}
{"text":"Literally came to this place every time I visit Chinatown, this place has AMAZING chicken hot pot with veggie. Other dishes are not bad! The complimentary desserts are SO GOOD, also the desserts change every day, surprised me every time!        Plus, the service is great!"}
{"text":"We had one vegetable dish & one soup...we had ordered a chicken dish but had to return it.  Before ordering we had asked the waiter whether the chicken had batter on it because the menu stated \"spicy dry chicken\" & the waiter confirmed there is no batter on the chicken.  Unfortunately the waiter nor the menu mentioned anything about the dish also containing deep fried noodles. 

When we brought up this issue with the waiter he wouldn't stop arguing with us...his explanation was that there is batter in every meat dish in every Chinese restaurant. We were not contesting that..we explained there was more than usual seasoning batter in the chicken to make it crispy & that is not what we had wanted...that is why we had asked ahead of ordering...

We are sure the food is great & everything is wonderful at this place but we had a bad experience because of the waiter's insistence that we knew about the dish & we still ordered it & that all the meat dishes in the restaurant are full of batter. So we stuck with the vegetable dish...

We found the service not to our liking...our first & last time at this restaurant..."}
{"text":"Reading below's review i thought WOW did i write that! 

Ended up here twice this week after a late night out the first was a friends idea the second was last night after Maro club and was my idea.

WHY would i go here again - well the food taste pretty good when its 3am and the portions are generous for a great price.

I have had a chicken curry and a beef and giner both on rice and they were both $5.50 on the menu! 

The service is quick, the food comes out very quick also and although it may not be the best food in the world for a place which is open so late and for good value then I would give it 3 stars.

I mean its either this or street meat right since fish and chips does not exist anywhere or decent kebab."}
{"text":"Been going here for years, food is fresh, well cooked and delicious. Their Shanghai noodle dishes are the best ive ever eaten. You wont be disappointed in your food, thats guaranteed."}
{"text":"if i could i'd give this 0 stars. bug cooked in my food.
absolutely disgusting.  who cooked my food and why aren't you paying attention to what you're packaging! wtf nasty ass beatle in my food when it arrived to my house through uber eats.  never again. never ever again."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Great Sang quite a few times.   I work overnight sometimes,  so finding a place that delivers is tricky.   These guys deliver late and the food is always good and fresh.   My only complaint would be that they have a certain driver who pretty much demands a tip from you.  Other than that they haven't disappointed me yet."}
{"text":"It smells funny and the decor is fairly lacking with the plastic tablecloths, but get past that and what you have is a pretty kick ass Chinese place that stays open late. Special mention goes to the won ton soup and crispy noodle beef, and the black bean beef on rice noodle. Delicious."}
{"text":"Wish there's a minus star option.  Went there Sat after party at 5am (Sun). 4 of us ordered shrimp wonton noodle. When the food came out we were amazed how tiny those wonton were. Then we realized they were fish balls (cheap ones with tons flour) with wonton wraps. Absolutely disgusting! STAY AWAY from it! !!"}
{"text":"Came here around 2am after a night of clubbing. The manager served us and was very charming and patient with our inebriated friends. The food hit the spot in terms of taste although the portions were small for basic Chinese dishes."}
{"text":"I found myself at Sang's Great Food on Spadina on Saturday night between 1230 and 0100 with Michael after we had had one sidecar too many at Pete's birthday party.  No, you don't know these people but that's the story about how I ended up eating here.  They do not have dumplings, which broke Michael's heart.

The good:
There was a dinner special for $8.50.  You have to ask for it.  Even in my late-night-chinese-food state I remembered the words eight dollars and fifty cents from the sign outside when they gave us the regular price menus.  Much to the waiters dissatisfaction, he went back to get us the special menus.  $8.50 buys you: soup (choice of 4 - hot and sour was pretty good!) spring roll and choice of entree (choice of MANY).  

The bad:
Ha, the food is the bad.  It wasn't terrible-bad but it certainly wasn't the best.  It may have been the best at 1am actually.  But I would never eat here before I went drinking - only after.

The weird-and-awesome:
The $8.50 dinner menu comes with a full FAMILY SIZED entree.  There was NO way we could have eaten all the food we were presented with for $17.00.

Would I go here again?  Yes.  Would I go here again before 1am?  Not a chance in hell."}
{"text":"not good at all! shrimp dumplings were dry and tasteless, the sechuan chicken was horrible, and everything was WAY overpriced!  avoid!"}
{"text":"A place full of Chinese people when neighbourhood's ones (including the famous Lee Garden) are not, that is a sign (or it is a rowdy gang's place...).

Was a really good surprise: food was really good, fresh, tasty, spicy as desired,  served warm and in generous portions. Service is Ok and yes it is with plastic napkin, but come on... it is not pretending to be a fine dining place! just a good one! and this night, it was a really good one!

Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came due to craving double lobster ginger onion ($39). It was satisfying. Also tried the cantonese chow mein and it was also good, had a decent amount of shrimp, flavour was good. Finally had the fried egg plant and it was not bad.

Overall the service was good, the food came out fast, and would probably come back again if craving ginger onion lobster."}
{"text":"Disgusting, raw mushrooms, old (brown all over the ends) vegetables and totally flavourless..except for super fishy flavour of the fake shrimp wontons! I can't believe they would send me a pile of garbage and call it 'food'. My first experience with UberEATS, and I'm so grossed out. I feel really stupid for essentially throwing $30 in the trash. I love actual Chinese food and have eaten in tons of restaurants downtown since I was a child, I would not write a bad review unless it seriously sucked.  STAY AWAY!!!"}
