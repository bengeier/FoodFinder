{"text":"I keep hoping this place improves as I live in Oregon so about every couple of months I try it. But unfortunately when I went again in November the service is still lousy, the atmosphere nothing special and the food at the lower scale of bar food. As for the sports bar aspect, there was Badger BB game on but it took numerous requests to our server and hostess to put it on the TV's. After 5 tries, I'm giving up on coming here."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and will be back again! Food was hot, tasty, burger cooked to perfection. Nice casual setting, perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"I live nearby and tried it twice. First time the salad was so bad -rotten lettuce- that had to return it. Lost my appetite. Second try was the fish fry. Another mistake. It was greasy and just tasteless. I actually got sick from it as soon as I got home. No more for me!?! Ugh !"}
{"text":"We had a large group that due to unforeseen circumstances we needed a place to eat last minute. Mulligan's was happy to accommodate us and provided spectacular service! We live in Oregon and this is one of our regular places. The food is always good and they have a good selection of draft beers."}
{"text":"Good choice if you are in the Oregon area.  Nice selection of items on the menu, decent kids menu as well.  Wings are very good, stew is excellent as well.  Service is always very friendly and accommodating, sometimes a little slow when they are busy, but still good.

Wish they would lose some of the \"bar\" atmosphere, but not too bad."}
{"text":"We love Mulligans! I have to say, we go there quite regularly.  We have never had a bad meal there.  There wraps are awesome, especially the veggie wrap.  The waffle fries are amazing too.  Friday night fish frys are great.  I really like the baked fish over the fried, but they are both good.  The clam chowder is excellent!  The service is usually very friendly, we have had a couple of not so good servers, but the good definitely outweighs the bad!  I would recommend anyone to visit there and enjoy some great food!"}
{"text":"We love coming here for their fish fry. 

When we get it to-go it's $10.95 for three fillets of cod, your choice of clam chowder our coleslaw, and choice of potato (waffle fries,  onion rings,  fries, our mashed potatoes). For $1 more we like to dine in and do the all- you - can- eat option of baked and/or fried cod. 

The fish is excellent!  Crisp,  lightly battered cuts of cod.  They are fork tender and contain a lot of flavor. Get the clam chowder!  It's fabulous - you won't regret it. 

They also have great drink specials too,  such as $2 armaretto sours."}
{"text":"Monday night is wing night at 50Â¢ a wing it's a good deal and the wings are high in quality! This place was a hidden Gem to me until recently! It's a quaint little \"Irish Pub\" tucked away on the out-skirts of Oregon. As my first sentence states WING NIGHT IS GREAT! Quality wings with great sauces and tons of other selections on the menu. Drinks are reasonably priced and the large wood bar welcomes you to relax and watch that game. They have a patio that faces a somewhat major road but it is still nice to sit out there.

They have TONS of seating for anyone who just wants to enjoy a nice evening out with the family, friends, or whoever. I think my favorite part about this place is the people who work there. They make ya feel like friends which is always nice. I hate going to a place to eat or drink and feeling like a complete outsider while the bartender or server takes care of their friends. 
3-stars, 80%, 3 Buffalo Horns, 19 Rabbit Pelts, 1/2 Walrus Tusk!"}
{"text":"The food at Mulligan's is ok, nothing great.  My main issue is that it's just dark and dingy.  A lot of the seats have duct tape on them and the carpet is dirty.  It's one of those places I would never eat salad from because I just get a bad e-coli vibe from it.  Unfortunately Oregon doesn't have many restaurants to offer so we end up going here out of default."}
{"text":"I am torn between three and four stars.  The food and service are decent and the bathrooms are clean, never had a problem here but it isn't our first choice to dine in Oregon."}
{"text":"Really good fish fry, and the fries, slaw, and clam chowder were really good too - best fish fry in Oregon. Monday wings night is a great deal. Cheese curds are awesome here too. Good beer. Can be a bit noisy, but nice to have a good place in Oregon to eat and drink.

Update: Clam chowder is really amazing! Sunday night chicken dinner is decent.

Read the next review about how all the food is tasteless and the clam chowder was horrible. Ummm, find me a better clam chowder in the area. I think someone was crabby patty that day. Oh, he had his little kids with him. No wonder!"}
{"text":"Solid good service. They have got my order right the 50 plus times I have been there. Good wings, burgers, and sandwiches at a fair price. It is also a very nice atmosphere to eat and clean."}
{"text":"Well, I am going to give this a big ____________!  Why?   Because that is what the food tasted like....nothing.

We decided to try Mulligans this past Saturday just because my wife wanted to try something local in Oregon (I tried to explain to her that almost everything in Oregon sucks except for Maria's Pizza).  So we tried Mulligans.

I had heard that had good wings so that was the first thing I got as an appetizer and of course I have to go for the \"Hot\" or \"Buffalo\" as they call them.  Well, they were big and meaty wings but holy crap did the sauce suck.  it is hard to explain the flavor but it was a combo of hot (witch i like) and baby food (witch I do not like).  Stike1!

With our meals came a choice of soup so both my wife and I got the Homemade Clam Chowder that the waitress raved about.  Strike 2 because it had ZERO and I mean ZERO flavor to it.

Ok...third time is a charm right?  Here comes our meal and I ordered a Prime Rib Sammich (supposed to come with peppers, cheese, and horseradish) and my wife got the french dip.  Mine came with no horseradish and that was noticeable because it was like tasting a shoe put on a bun with some tasteless peppers on it.  I asked for the horseradish and she brought it out and pretty much my Prime Rib Sammich that tasted like nothing turned into a horseradish sammich by adding some very watered down horseradish. Oh, by the way the Prime Rib was not medium like prime rib is supposed to be. It was well done. STRIKE  3!

My wife French Dip was more of the same.  Tasteless and lacking any sort of flavor at all.  I would easily say the best thing we had was my daughters tasteless Mac & Cheese.

Sorry Mulligans, no mulligan for you for this Yelper!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and have a drink.  Large menu with different food selections.  I enjoyed they have a dinning room separated from the bar area."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised, especially after reading some of these reviews.  We went on a Friday and had the fish.  Baked and fried.  Both were really good and the kids enjoyed their meals, too.  The service was good, too."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened with the menu changes, but we will be passing on what was once a regular place for dinner. Our last visit was on \"rib night\" and we were very disappointed in the tough meat - it was hard to cut through it with a knife! In the past the ribs I've had there were always \"fall off the bone\" tender. We have heard that other menu items are not as good as they once were, too.

Our waitress was awesome and offered us dessert due to our experience (I are 3 ribs before giving up). The wait staff is always pretty friendly - it'd be great if they could improve the delivery on their menu."}
{"text":"I was plesently surprised at both the service and quality of food.  This is fast becoming a regualr stop. Decided to stray from the normal friday night fish fry and came on Saturday for the prime rib special. I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked to perfection  service was spot on as well. My daughter had a regular burger that was not that good . It was a standar frozen burger. She did ordered a second bowl of their famous clam chowder and it did not last long.  Mmgood."}
{"text":"We had a group of about 20 of us at Mulligan's. We had reserved a week before, so they had no trouble accommodating us. They have a separated area for groups of that side, so is a nice spot for having a private event or birthday party inside. 

The service was great, food came out in a decent amount of time for the size of the group we had. 

I got a smoked salmon sandwich and my wife a grilled chicken hers was pretty good and mine was rather mediocre, not bad, but not great either.

I'd give the food 3 stars and the atmosphere and service 5."}
{"text":"They have excellent food and great decor. The clam chowder is seriously amazing! Sometimes it gets pretty crowded - but the food is so good it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice service and tasty fish fry on Fridays. We are able to take our two toddlers and still enjoy our dinner. Wait for table has never been long, food is fast even on busy nights, service is speedy."}
{"text":"I was recently invited to Mulligans by another couple. I had thought the name sounded familiar then I remember they're associated with Martin O'Grady's on Mineral Point Road on Madison's far West Side. 

So I met them at 8 on a Friday night and we had to wait about 10-15 minutes for a table. By looking at the parking lot I figured their was going to be a wait, so no surprises there. We were seated shortly there after and our waitress told us about the fish special. All three of us ordered the AYCE Cod, deep fried. Before the fish we had the chicken tenders as an appetizer. The tenders were delicious. Now the Cod arrived shortly after and we dug in. It was nice and hot, flaky, and moist. This stuff was FRESH! You could choose between waffle fries, regular fries or I believed a baked potato? I had the regular fries which were good, someone else ordered the waffle fries and they had a nice seasoning to them. 

The fish was definitely good sized and the tartar sauce was nice and creamy too!

If your in Oregon or the South side of Madison I'd recommend trying it out. 

Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Easily the worst TASTING fish fry I've ever had. Hands down.  The $15 walleye was flavorless and mushy. It was gross, really gross. My wife was disappointed with her fried cod. It was about what I expected for cheap All You Can Eat. Her veggies were a pile of mush that looked and tasted like they were microwaved, frozen veggies. 

With serious fish fries all over the Madison area, this is one you can definitely skip. Unless you want a lot of mushy flavorless food, then this could be your jam."}
{"text":"This review is for their fish dinner.   I decided to give it a try a while back and it was ok.   I expected better.   It was fine but for a friday fish fry I will go elsewhere. I guess I'll give them a Mulligan on this one. Maybe that's how they got their name."}
{"text":"It was fun overall, they only had 2 bartenders working so it took forever to get drinks. The only dart board was in an awkward corner of the bar so it was a challenge to play with a large group of people. The atmosphere and music was good though and it looked like they had a nice patio that could be used in warmer weather. I can't comment on the food since I was only here to drink at the bar."}
{"text":"Had some amazing Old Fashions here and they have the best waffle fries. I ordered the chili and some cheese curds, my boyfriend had the Double Bypass Burger."}
{"text":"Incredibly unremarkable.  Unremarkable food.  Unremarkable beer on tap.  Unremarkable staff.  Stopped in and seemed to attract more of a \"townie\" clientele.  Not that there is anything wrong with that but with everything else being yawn-worthy, it doesn't warrant a repeat visit."}
{"text":"I totally agree with Robert T of Fitchburg. I only go to Mulligans when I have to (mostly for a drink). The service stinks and the food ain't much better. People who are raving about the claim chowder just don't know what taste is.They could at least add some OLD BAY to it for pete's sake."}
