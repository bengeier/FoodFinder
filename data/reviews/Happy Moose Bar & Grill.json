{"text":"Very good bar food, excellent service and  the bartenders and servers are efficient and easy on the eyes. If you like wings, this is one of the best places in Lake County and I believe Wednesday is a wing night."}
{"text":"Three stars because I have had good and bad experiences here.  Never really had an issue with the food, but being seated by the side door in the middle of winter was not a good idea.  When we asked the hostess about the location and the door with the smokers, she stated that the door isn't even open.  

We sat there for about 5 minutes with people wandering in and out of that door along with the December air and their smoke trails before we asked to move.

Our next location was by the bathrooms in a location where they were moving tables for a big crowd coming in.  Lots of fun ... I guess she showed us who's boss, lol"}
{"text":"Absolutely love happy moose. It's like cheers with the staff. They love our kids and treat us like family. Food is amazing and service is great. Pat and the staff are the best"}
{"text":"Do not go here. Sunday night wait staff could care less. Forgot to put in order for our food. Greedy mess!"}
{"text":"All these positive reviews for this place must have been written by the owners or employees.  The service is fine as well as the atmosphere, but the food is TERRIBLE!  I have given this place 3 chances and thrown out most of what I ordered every single time.  All of the wing sauces are bland and taste nothing like their description on the menu, and all of the appetizers are straight from the frozen food section at costco.  This was truly disappointing because I loved the place when it was cleats, but now its just a waste of a building."}
{"text":"Our waitress was extremely nice and helpful and our food came out quickly. The best thing we tried was the celery and blue cheese dressing. THAT WAS THE BEST!!

Sadly, the wings were salty and lacking in flavor. I ordered the Bigfoot burger. It was \"big\" that's about it. My fianc√© had a Southwest Chicken Wrap which was a bit above average. Oh, and our drinks were very weak. So weak in fact that I forgot we had them.
If you are interested in less then mediocre bar food, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I remember when this place was voted best bar food in lake county, when it was called Cleats. But now, I have to say, the ownership has made it even better. Lots of the same wing sauces and better burgers. 
A+"}
{"text":"I think if I tagged myself there on Facebook the hostess would of noticed me... We walked out"}
{"text":"Love this place. There is legitimately a tv to watch from every seat in there. The waitresses are good looking, the service is fast, and the food is amazing. Definitely the best bar food around here. They have the fattest and juiciest burgers around. The portions are huge, I always have leftovers. This place has a positive atmosphere and is my go-to bar for browns, buckeyes and cavs games. Love the patio, they have palm trees and it just feels like a getaway. I would recommend this place for all ages"}
{"text":"First visit:  had a great server. She was very attentive. The sliders were great and cooked perfectly at medium. However, the chips were overcooked and the hummus was rather tasteless. Overall it was average bar food."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch often. Salads are great and at a reasonable price. It is better than average bar food and service is great."}
{"text":"Ugh. 
One star is for the server who was great, the second star is for my beer which was also great. The food gets zero stars. Go to Arby's across the parking lot instead."}
{"text":"Tasty drink menu and great burgers, but the wings were just so-so and the service was lacking. We had to stand up front for a number of minutes before someone finally came over to seat us, then our waitress never gave us a drink menu and came to take our order before we even opened our menus. She wasn't very attentive and seemed scattered during the rest of our visit. We'll probably give the place another shot since the food was good and give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe it was just a bad day for the workers..."}
{"text":"Terrible. We waiting almost an hour for breakfast for the waitress to finally come out and say it's now on. Eggs don't take an hour. Very filthy and worn down."}
{"text":"Mom and I stopped in here for a late lunch. We were seated promptly and our waitress was right over. Our drinks arrived very quick, and the menu is huge! They have a little bit of everything from salads to wings to sandwiches. I got the steak sandwich and mom got the Cuban. Both sandwiches were delicious!! My steak was over cooked just a teeny but but it was still great. Moms Cuban was good too. The fries are awesome - add a little malt vinegar and they taste like the old cedar point fries from when I was little. We were never wanting for drinks or anything - our waitress was totally on top of it. I took off one star because our waitress, while great, never introduced herself, she never smiled, and she never said thank you. If that was remedied, it would have been 5 stars. The food was good enough for us to return."}
{"text":"Nice TVs, great beer selection, good service!
...but did you really charge $.59 for the blue cheese that came with my wings? Really???"}
{"text":"Foods are good, but Wine.....  Good service for sure.
You kcan enjoy  :)"}
{"text":"Stopped into this place one prior time and wasn't impressed with the service.  But, decided to stop in again to attend a fundraiser.  Fortunately the money spent went to the fundraiser and not the establishment.  There were apparently 2 large parties booked - several people said they had screwed up and double booked.  The kitchen and the staff had no hope of keeping up.  After standing around for 45 minutes waiting for chicken wings, I decided I was done with this chance.  The staff was rude to other guests and very disorganized.  The parking lot and the adjacent parking lots were all full.. had to park in the far back of the hotel behind the restaurant.  2nd chance - fail.  Make room for another restaurant in Mentor."}
{"text":"place was clean staff was pleasant but the manger not so good he was content on sitting at the bar and trying to pick up on the blond. now the food we ordered bone in and boneless wings they were good and a nice size how ever the pretzel sticks gross I use to love them but they changed something they are a must not to have. I will be back becase of the wings"}
{"text":"If you love 25 minute salads and management oblivious to loud kids this sports bar/ alcoholic establishment is for you!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Service is GREAT!!! Good food, strong drinks & awesome bar, grill / hangout atmosphere!!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"The service is terribly slow! We visited on a weekday and the bar was empty. The waitress took our order quickly but it took a long time for it to arrive. We ordered the wing sampler. Most of the wings were overlooked and dry. Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"Sliders are tasty, no frozen patties here. All handmade!  Try you won't be disappointed. Staff is friendly, environment is welcoming and the music is a great mix to satisfy all. Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Local bar that could not fill the seats on a Late Friday or Saturday night.  Service is perfunctory and mixed dinks run $7.  Lots of TVs featuring plenty of sports.  Outside seating in good weather."}
{"text":"Ate in with my daughter. Food was decent. Problem came with my to-go order for my wife. We asked for boneless wings, they gave us bone-in. When we discovered the problem at home, I called the restaurant and they told me to come back in to pick up the correct order. There was no additional effort to rectify their mistake which should have been done considering I had to drive back on account of their error."}
{"text":"Great place to come for a drink the bartenders are super sweet and the food is phenomenal. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Good News for those who had lost faith in the service end of the restaurant business. My faith has been restored by Chris, a partner in the Happy Moose. He took the time to contact me, apologize and ask what it would take to make things right. The answer to that was...you just did it. The food has always been good, the beer is cold, and except for one unexplained snafu that I wrote about below, the Happy Moose has been my sports bar of choice. I'm happy to say it is once again. I have returned a few times with friends and have been met with nothing but happy faces & courteous service. Thank you Chris!"}
{"text":"I had to write a review after our experience. We had a party of 8 on a Saturday  night so maybe that was our first mistake. Now, I never go to a bar and grill expecting to be wowed or treated like royalty but this was kind of ridiculous. We were seated pretty quickly. Once our whole party had arrived, everyone ordered and received drinks in a good amount of time. I thought it would be a good experience. But then we waited and waited... and waited. We finally saw our server... taking an order for a table who got there after us, getting drinks for said table, and running back and forth in the kitchen like his hair was on fire. He finally came out of the kitchen to flirt with the bartender while she made drinks for another of his tables. I made eye contact with him several times. I think our whole table was staring at him actually. He looked directly at us and then turned on his heel and fast walked into the kitchen. Maybe we looked menacing? All I know is we had been there for 45 minutes, most of us had empty drinks, and we still hadn't ordered food. My husband finally got the hostess and told her we were just waiting to place our order. So our server, Mike, finally came over with a little tiny chip on his shoulder and efficiently wrote down everything we wanted. Then as he walked away he said \"I'm Mike if you guys need anything\" with just the slightest bit of attitude. Well, buddy, if we could get you to come to our table, we'd certainly rather deal with you than the hostess.

The food came out. Everything was ok I guess. My zucchini planks were sitting in oil. That was bad presentation and it also would've made them soggy if I hadn't gotten them off the plate and set them on another. Use a paper towel or something, people!
My husbands \"medium\" burger was quite well done and dry. He didn't eat it but our server was so inattentive he didn't want to deal with asking for a new one or getting it taken off the bill. I ordered the Tsunami burger with a veggie patty instead of a regular burger patty. I thought that the teriyaki steak listed was just the kind of burger patty they used but apparently there are little chunks of teriyaki steak ON the burger. Oops. But if you were the server or the cook in the kitchen and you saw that someone was ordering a veggie patty, wouldn't you ask if the customer actually wants the little pieces of steak on her burger as well? Maybe double check. Just a little customer service. All in all, it was memorable for the fact that we had such awful service and such ho-hum food. It was REALLY hard to keep our drinks full on top of everything else. This server could've made some money on us. We've all been in the service industry and we get how challenging it can be so we're good tippers. It's a shame. I really wanted to like this place. I'll still give it another try but I'll be asking to stay out of Mike's section. I was jealous of all the other customer who seemed to be getting much better service."}
{"text":"Amazing bar food everything on the menu is delicious. I've been coming here for years and never had a bad experience food or service. My favorite sports bar period. The wings are great! I love the happy moose!"}
{"text":"Heard from a friend of mine that the tequila is good here. Came up here a couple hundred times to confirm..tequila still good"}
{"text":"If you are a regular and a young male you get tons of attention at the bar. If not good luck getting timely service"}
{"text":"I don't write a lot of negative reviews, but....I just read my old review that I forgot I had written. Funny, I had the same complaint then as I do now. Went back to meet a friend for drinks and sat for 15 minutes while five young ladies talked to each other behind the bar. Then waited for my second drink long enough that I was out of time and just got the check instead. My friend made the observation vocal and our waitresses offered excuses that it was shift change and then got an attitude. I was just gonna pay my tab and leave, but even if I disagreed with my friend's tactic, still don't think that's excuse for the staff to be rude, defensive, or argumentative. Just apologize and move on."}
{"text":"After sitting at the bar waiting at Smoking Bones next door and I left (and another guy did), we both walked into the Happy Moose.  I was leery of a non-chain in what looks like it used to be a Denny's.  Well NO worries.  The service here was IMPECCABLE.  Fast, sincere, dynamite.  Then the food was DARN GOOD!  I totally didn't expect the good food, not average but good food.  Temerature was too high?  They put on the A/C.  Cold beer glasses.  I will return tonight.  Good work, folks, good work.  I am so happy to compliment your good job.  You have a nice place and I slam people when they deserve it - and this was clearly 5 stars (within your market segment.)  Prices were reasonable, not cheap because we don't want cheap food, and not gouging with a nice appetizer special.  Keeping the place cool when it's warm out is what me and all my co-workers want, excellent work."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday evening.  Too many kids, boneless wings weren't bad but I could've done a better presentation."}
{"text":"Food is usually good. Service is solid. It's basically everything you would expect for a bar restaurant. Nothing really stands out as really good, or really bad."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection, pretty good variety of bar food. Good place to watch sports games. 

This last visit I made a terrible mistake ordering the Tsunami burger. Oy. Wth was I thinking? I was looking for a Hawaiian type burger with pineapple but obviously didn't read all that was on it. There were pieces of steak ON the burger. I thought it was a steak burger when I read \"steak\" in the description. Also, they put fries on it - pourquoi? And an egg - which I had them leave off because there's a time and place for egg on burger and that was not it. Anywhoo, too much stuff going on and so unnecessary and a waste. 

I've had wings, wraps and salads before, so I know food is not that terrible. Next time I'm sticking to something less stupid.

Service - waitresses have usually been nice, but some of the bartenders are not the friendliest bunch, but whatevs."}
{"text":"Visiting from NC and enjoyed the food. I had a burger and it was as ordered, fresh roll and decent fries. Everyone in our group was pleased. We sat outside and it was nice. Service was good and always someone walking around taking dishes and checking in on you."}
{"text":"Stay away! Stay far, far away. I tried to give them a second chance after staying away the first time I was here. Food sucks, especially the wings. They are rubbery and have a lot of fat on them. The bartenders are too busy gossiping amongst each other to help out the patrons. and the worst part? The price! Ridiculously high for what you get. Nope. Never coming back. I learned my lesson."}
