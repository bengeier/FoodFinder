{"text":"Delicious pizza! The huge size reminds me of New York style pieces where the only way to eat it is folded in half. The thin crust was yummy and they fill the slices with toppings. Not bad for the price, definitely have had more expensive pizza. Nice new place in Medina. Staff was friendly too."}
{"text":"Very good neopolitanl/New York.City style pizza. Took home 2 huge slices and warmed up on a pizza stone in a 500 degree oven the next day and was perfect. Being from the Philadelphia area and very familiar with good pizza that is available on the east coast, I appreciate when a place like Courthouse Pizzeria opens. Most people in this area are unfortunately too used to pizza made with dense dough and bland taste. The pizza here is made made with fresh dough that is the right consistency, airy and crisp. The sauce and cheese was the right amount and was very good. Now we know where to go to get pizza that reminds me of places we are familiar with in eastern PA, the Jersey Shore and New York City."}
{"text":"I grew up on NY style pizza and this pizza hits the mark. The pizza crust is thin and crunchy. I know some reviews noted that the dough was undercooked but in experience it was not.  This place just opened up and they are missing the mark on pricing. $16 for a large cheese pie and $3 per topping.  To me that is steep for extra toppings.  If you like thin crust pizza this a good place for that."}
{"text":"Very disappointing...pizza had no taste ...a lot of flies to bat away from the food....and the music was so loud that you could not hold a conversation...also the crust was like cardboard hard to eat."}
{"text":"Went last night. Pizza was cold, sauce drab. Not enough seating, one woman pushed through the crowd and saved multiple tables and her party wasn't even there yet, nor did she even order! Great idea, but it will need more to survive."}
{"text":"Being from New Jersey, it is very hard to find a good pizza here in Ohio.  I have only found one so far, Napolis in downtown Canton.  So, needless to say, i really wanted to like this place.  It was a big letdown though.  While it looks close to a New York style pie, there really is no crust to be had and barely any taste coming from extra spices.  Couple that with all of the flies and a weird regge atmosphere for an Italian place, it just really fell short of my hopes."}
{"text":"Have been eagerly anticipating their opening for several weeks now, as Medina has relatively weak pizza offerings (chains, etc...)

Courthouse Pizzeria produces a tasty pie, crust is very good when ordered 'well done'.  (I saw a few slices on tables inside that were visually inedible, undercooked - might chalk that up to opening day bumps....)

Sauce is very good, cheese is excellent.  Overall, the pizza is much better than anything else you can buy in Medina.  However, I'd like them to extend the toppings edge to edge (I had a good 2+ inches of crust only all around the pie), and I sort of felt a little ripped off at the price tag - I paid $3 for pepperoni, and got a total of 17 pieces of pepperoni covering a 16\" pizza.  Not OK at all.  I understand the pricing structure at $4/slice, but my sense is that they'll get some pushback at charging $16 for a whole pie, no price break at all - and at the very least I'd think they would discount the toppings on a whole pie.

Very good pizza, but the last thing I'd want is my customers feeling a little ripped off at the price tag....much better to have us thrilled at the pizza and feel like the value was there.  Great potential here though."}
{"text":"A boat without an oar.

The concept is great. The square NEEDS a decent pizza place that is cheap and good. This place needs some serious help unfortunately. The prices are a bit steep for what it is....semi flavored cardboard pizza. The staff are clueless. I can't help but think that this is occupying prime square space that could serve something else."}
{"text":"Was truly hoping that we'd love this place, but alas we just can't.  We ordered a 16\" pizza, half cheese and half topped with pepperoni.  On the PLUS side, the sauce and cheese were tasty, and the half of the pizza with pepperoni had an adequate amount of topping.  

But on the MINUS side:

A 16\" pizza cut into only 4 pretty soggy crust slices makes for a challenge to eat.

In addition, the 4 slices were not cut through and instead of 2 slices with pepperoni and 2 without, it was about 1-1/2 slices without and 2-1/2 slices with pepperoni.

Now for my other objections.  Our 16\" pizza cost $17.50 plus tax;  the total bill was $22.95, not an inexpensive pizza.  But we had to eat a soggy crust pizza off paper plates which are smaller than each piece, causing them to hang over the edge of the paper plates.  And we struggled to cut and eat with VERY flimsy plastic utensils.  It was almost impossible to cut and/or eat each piece, and my husband realized when he finally gave up trying that at some point, he'd snapped off part of a tine from his flimsy plastic fork and had eaten it!  The LEAST that could be offered are real plates and silverware for dine in customers.  I don't want to fight with my food on a too-small paper plate with very small and flimsy plastic utensils!  And I certainly don't want to ingest part of my fork!  Especially when you have to wait on yourself, and clean up after yourself.

We love pizza, and would probably eat there frequently, but unless they begin serving on real plates with real utensils, we can spend our almost $23.00 for pizza elsewhere, where we are waited on, cleaned up after, and have a more pleasant eating experience.  Really sorry and disappointed."}
{"text":"Please name one pizza the Dale Chase and set the price at $500 but then say \"Since you clearly can't afford it we'll suspend $483 of the price and only charge you $17.\" That's what he does to every thug he sentences. Too funny! Can't wait to try your pizza. Hurry up and open already!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you like re-cooked pizza and burnt crust, this place is for you."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a facebook friend.  So I decided to take my son there for lunch.   This pizzeria is located in a cool spot, right in Medina Square....the staff were friendly & attentive, the place was clean, and the pizza..... WOW!!   We ordered a large pizza with ham, pepperoni, pineapple, and extra sauce.  My son and I both thought that it was very good!   ...oh, and it actually came with extra sauce!  I hate it when I request extra sauce at a pizza place and they just seem to ignore the request.  This happens at many places, and there's no good reason for it.  But, the staff at Courthouse Pizzeria got it right, and the pizza tasted Great!

This pizzeria also offers subs, salads and bread sticks, which all looked good but, on this day, we only ordered the pizza. 
 Besides that, the drink dispenser has a good selection.  The napkins, forks & other items were all stocked well, and the bathroom was clean. 
I am glad to recommend this pizzeria to others, and will go back sometime!"}
{"text":"Second time eating here at Courthouse Pizzeria. 
I've only gotten the monster 18 inch pizza on both occasions.  WOW.....Good stuff!!
It's a 8 cut pizza, but each slice is huge. 
We were only going to get a slice for each of us but we both knew we would want more then just the one.  
I believe that they only have the one size and if your going to have at least two pieces each, it just makes sense.  They have the basic fountain drink selection & a sweet & unsweetened tea to choose from. 
Very basic dining area with large windows on the corner of the building to check out everything on the square.  
You don't need anything else, when the pizza is this good"}
{"text":"I stopped by tonight to get a slice of pizza before working the concert in the square the pizza good I see it has improved Since you opened 

One thing I do ask do you plan to put seasoning in the crust because I notice tonight the crust was dry that had no taste. 

Other then that the pizza was good I would return for sure maybe try something new."}
{"text":"I am giving Courthouse Pizza three stars but they should get 3 1/2 - they are not 4...yet!

I have read the older reviews and some of the complaints have been changed/fixed. They now have metal silverware, the pizzas are 18\" now (not 16\") and they will give you a New York slice (you need to fold it) or they will cut it in half so you can hold it....ummmm...Ohio style? The restaurant is clean and is has a well designed interior. 

I do wish they had better quality napkins and tables/chairs with more style. 

It is a thin crust pizza and if you don't like that you won't like their pizza. I like thick, thin, Chicago, hot, cold, round, square...wait sorry got lost dreaming of pizza...well any type of pizza. 

As you can see in the pictures they give a generous amount of toppings and the staff was friendly. 

It is hard to find a good local, eat-in pizza place (sorry no yellow/orange plastic franchise McPizza for me - I hope McBurger doesn't try pizza next). I will be back and I hope Courthouse continues to improve...give them a try when in Medina."}
{"text":"Was expecting much more from the location and effort put into the facility. Just not much to say about the product. Just your basic pizza."}
{"text":"Hoping for more flavor in the pizza. Plain-tasting crust, cheese was 7/10, sauce not flavorful. Waited a LONG time to get our pizza. So long that 10 people went before us getting whole pizzas! Summary: avg base flavor and cardboard crust, poor service from staff. On the high side for what you get."}
{"text":"I knew it wasn't going to be good, the guy who opened it was interviewed by the gazette and he literally said he didn't have a recipe for pizza dough.  It is not awful, but its close.  It's like a hand tossed chuckie cheese pizza.  Clearly canned sauce on a flavorless crust with the toppings thrown on after they make it.  There are probably people who will like it, but I'm not taking my family of 6 to spend $30 on pizza served on paper plates.  I'm in here now and I'm literally being attacked by flies as I sit here.  It sucks, because I really wanted to like this place, it would have been perfect if they knew how to make pizza..."}
{"text":"Overpriced and I was extremely disappointed in my pizza.  We stopped in for the first time during the Ice festival. Because they were so busy it seemed that they precooked their pizza and then put your toppings on and warmed the pizza up. When I got my pizza my toppings still seemed raw and easily fell off the pizza. I understand why they did this process for time efficiency but it was a huge disappointment for how much we paid for once slice. The cheesy bread however tasted really fresh! We really like that!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty good. When you order breadsticks, you get a ton! They have a lunch combo deal which is decently priced. Other prices are decent as well. It's a good place to meet friends for lunch. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Eh, it's ok for a slice on the go but don't try to feed the family here. Go anywhere else it'll taste better and be cheaper.  
Dough is tasteless,  sauce is from a can,  so are the mushrooms.
Left just in time to witness the staff running a dirty shopvac all over the food preparation area.  Also,  I'm pretty sure it's a health code violation to take your garbage out the front door.  Not to mention,  it grosses out your customers."}
{"text":"The pizza is kind of pricy for what it is.  I'm not a fan of the floppy pizza and friends from New York say it's not like the same dough they use in New York so it doesn't taste like the same crust.  

It's always fun eating on the square, so I enjoy coming here occasionally, but more for the location than the food or prices."}
{"text":"The pizza and atmosphere were really good!!! Great combination with the activities in the square. However, the pricing is a little high for a slice of cheese pizza at $4 each... I will most defiantly bring my family back again!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night due to excessive wait times at other places. Food was excellent and the service was amazing. Our daughter especially loves being able to watch the pizza being made and the dough being thrown. Price isn't that bad for the amount of food you get. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Envision a mall food court Sbarro set in a historic corner store and then you have Courthouse Pizza. A slice (1/4 of a 16\" pie) is $4 and each topping is $.75. They have cheese and pepperoni pizzas pre-made and when you order, they add your toppings and reheat it in the oven. They overloaded the pizza with toppings which made me feel like I was getting my money's worth, but doesn't  necessarily translate into better pizza..."}
{"text":"Most criticisms for the pizza usually revolve around Midwest sensibilities of how pizza should be. Courthouse is New York Style - the way it's supposed to be (the only other legitimate claim Is Sicilian/Mediterranean as far as authenticity). Chicago has deep dish, but it's a myth that they like deep dish. They prefer thin, NY style as well. They only eat the deep dish pizza when their friends and family come to visit for \"something Chicago\". Lost between Manhattan and Chicago is us where we came up with something in-between the two and it became the norm and default, which is the same reason frozen and franchise pies resemble this as well. In my opinion, this place is great; it's acceptable NY style pizza."}
{"text":"This certainly is not my top choice when the intense craving for delicious pizza hits. This may have to do with the fact that in not really a fan of New York style pizza. Ive been here more than a few times since they opened last year and while the inner workings of the establishment have improved over time (organization on the front end in terms of lines and congested dining area merging with line to order) I feel like the pizza hasn't really changed much. 

Without fail, every time we order pizza here I end up blotting it with an entire stack of napkins to get the pools of grease off the slice, and I certainly wouldn't say that it's even \"great\" pizza. In reality it simply does the job when it's one of the fastest options for food while on Medina Square. 

I will say that the staff are usually very friendly but some of the younger employees could definitely use some work in area of smiling when greeting customers throughout the ordering/pick up process. 

On the plus side, they have bathrooms and you can order by the slice (1/4 of a pizza) if you don't want to deal with ordering an entire pie. Also, they have (had) a buy 10 slices get the 11th slice free but it only applies to purchasing single slices not whole pizza pies (4 slices in a pie)."}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience with Courthouse.  We have done both dine in and carry out.  The Pizza is good and the slices are large.  They do get busy and with that comes longer wait times, but no more then any other business."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review. Because after a year or two it seems like these guys have really figured out what it is that makes them unique. The pizza itself seems to have gotten better. And they have figured out how to make their New York style pizza without having an undercooked crust. Also if you just ask for a crispy that helps a lot too. Not to mention their cheesy bread is absolutely amazing. The online ordering and service is also running very smoothly. They have really come a long way and it is great to have a gourmet pizza place in Medina."}
{"text":"Stopped here after visiting the square in Medina. Knew nothing about it except name on sign indicated pizza. We went in about 3:30pm on a Friday. Small seating capacity, but it was not crowded. Went to counter and ordered pizza with mushrooms and drinks. Sat down and waited about 10 minutes when pizza came to the table. Pizza was thin crust, hand tossed , and saw them toss it, not a pre-made frozen dough crust. Really good pizza. Drinks were fountain style. Service was very good and friendly. Do not know if we will ever get back to Medina again, but would definitely return to Courthouse Pizzeria."}
{"text":"Tried a slice of pepperoni during Pizza Palooza in the square and wasn't impressed. Crust was paper thin and soggy. Pepperoni slices were small and weren't flavorful.  It was very average pizza. Not awful but not special either."}
{"text":"I moved here fron NYC 10 years ago and courthouse has finally hit my NY pizza crave thank you for opening in Medina.  For those people complaing about the pizza this is how stone oven pizza is.  Pan pizzas are everywhere in Medina thank you for being outside the box."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the reviews online about the pricing what you get for it the taste of the product and the overall experience of and untrained staff that seem to be talking to each other and not paying attention to anything they're doing as they smirk at you

Four dollars a slice for paper thin cardboard and cheese $16 for a pie that I could eat by myself in about two minutes because there is nothing to it , weak toppings etc etc
no substance at all

What a shame I won't be back
Don't waste your time or money"}
{"text":"Just as a previous reviewer stated, I don't understand the poor reviews. This place offers a very good New York-style pizza - possibly that is where the issue is; they're not expecting that style. The ingredients were top quality, the pizza was piping hot, and just plain tasty. You can order a whole pie or by the slice - great if everyone wants something different. We also ordered cheesy/garlic bread and they didn't skimp on the cheese, for sure. The slices of pizza are huge and you'd be hard-pressed to eat more than 1. The service was as good as I've received at any restaurant, let alone a pizza parlor. The owner was very friendly and the staff couldn't be more appreciative or attentive to us. It was just an all-around fun, tasty experience and we plan to return whenever we are back in Medina. Ignore the negative reviews, and visit if you're interested in New York-style pizza at a place that clearly appreciates your business."}
{"text":"-A Good Place To Grab A Greasy Slice-

I enjoyed the pizza here. I wouldn't go out and say it's the best pizza I've ever had, but it was good. I went with a friend of mine and our food came out quickly and piping hot. It was a nice change from the regular pizza chains.

Staff was polite and attentive. They made sure everything tasted well and there wasn't a single staff member standing around (which is nice to see everyone cleaning, cooking, taking orders, and asking patrons about how their meal tasted).

Pricing was reasonable, especially when my friend and I were paying separate. We each got the \"Slice and Soda\" deal which came with 1/4 of a full pizza and a soft drink for $5.

My only complaint was that the pizza was extremely greasy, even for my tastes.

There isn't much more to say for a pizza parlor review. I would say that it's worth a try if you want something different than a chain pizza place."}
{"text":"We love this place. HUGE slices, reasonable prices and as authentic as NYC. Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Thin crust NY style slices large enough to fold. Pizza was great, but canned mushrooms made me only give 4 stars"}
{"text":"For sure, hands down, no comparisons. This is the best pizza shop in Medina! I don't understand the poor reviews. The pizza is off the charts. The salads are fantastic. The owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"Courthouse is a sweet little pizzeria in the square of Medina. You can order pizza by the slice or whole pie. The slice is actually a quarter of an 18 inch pie cut into two slices. The cost for that quarter of a pie is only $4!  A full 18 inch pie is only $16 for cheese. They also have a large variety of toppings you can add. The employees were kind, patient and helpful!  Best of all...the pizza was delicious!  It's a thin, New York style crust that's hard to find in the Cleveland area. I'm not in the Medina area often but I suspect I'll be making a special trip there specifically for Courthouse Pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza. Cheesy breads ticks are yummy too. Really friendly attentive service. A tad expensive for pizza but worth it in my opinion. Can only order by the slice which is really 2 normal size slices or a whole pizza. Usual topping choices plus some not so ordinary like pesto. Some are premium charge."}
{"text":"To be honest my fiancé and I waited awhile to try this place. Living within walking distance of the square we are always excited for new businesses opening. Pizza is also our favorite food. This place had a line out the door for the first couple of weeks so we avoided it. I read some poor reviews online and saw a lot about how expensive one slice is. Finally one evening we decided to try it while my parents were in town. How did we wait so long?! This place is amazing. $4 for a giant slice of perfectly prepared pizza. This is the kind of pizza that I crave all of the time. Real Nyc style hand made pizza. Nothing else compares. $4 for one slice or $16 for a whole. If anybody is aware of what a place costs on the square and how good this pizza is, it's well worth it. We like to go get pizza and then head to Chill after for ice cream. It is the perfect addition to Medina and I'm glad they are there!"}
{"text":"So the first time I ordered here, I called it in and was told 20 minutes. I get there in 20 and they're just making it and acted as if it was still baking. Second time I ordered it while there, but to go. Good thing I was watching because they screwed up the items and I caught it going in the oven, it was also real salty. This time I order Monday $10 one item and they charge me for two items. Half was plain and the other half was onion and mushrooms, which is considered at any other pizza place as \"1\" item! They up charge for bacon here too, as it's a premium item!"}
{"text":"Courthouse Pizzeria occupies the old Whitey's Army Navy store, and patrons will be surprised at how different the inside looks. The space is wide and open, and there's plenty of shared seating available; just be aware that as it's shared, you may likely have to share a space with others if it's busy. The menu is somewhat simple, as they only have either pizza slices or a full 18\" pizza. They also have sub sandwiches on their menu, as well as things like cheesy bread and side salads. They don't offer much in terms of \"specialty\" pies, they had 3 to choose from, but unfortunately they don't list the descriptions on the large chalkboard menu near the register. The pricing is pretty straightforward as well, you can get a plain slice of pizza for $4 and an 18\" pizza for $16. Toppings are extra ($2 for regular, $3 for specialty toppings for the large pizzas). If you stop in on Mondays, you'll be happy to find this price is greatly reduced, and you can purchase any one-topping pizza for just $10. If you choose to get more than one-topping during this special, you'll just pay full price for the topping, but you'll still get the discount price for the 18\" pizza. 

I found the service here to be pretty good, we were greeted immediately when we entered, and the staff was very friendly when cashing us out. The fast-casual style allows you to grab a seat wherever and help yourself to the soda fountain while you wait for your pizza to be prepared; it doesn't take long as it's a rather thin crust. My biggest gripe about the space itself is that the whole place has that burnt-pizza Chuck-E-Cheese smell to it, which I personally find really revolting. 

The pizza itself is nothing special to me personally;some will really enjoy how thin the crust is, but for me it was so thin that it turned into a floppy, sloppy mess. it doesn't have that wood-fire oven taste to it either. My boyfriend loved how generous they were with the toppings, and I agree, they definitely didn't skimp in this area- but again, the thin crust isn't really conducive to holding up so much topping. The cheese and sauce were completely ordinary to me. I feel like if I had payed full price, I may have been a bit disappointed, but I do know there are those that really enjoy this kind of pizza. I think it's worth a try if you enjoy thin crust pizza, but definitely not worth a long drive from out of town just to try it."}
