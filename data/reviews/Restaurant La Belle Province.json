{"text":"Best place for poutines, fries & submarines . Always busy , but fast service . Great take out place"}
{"text":"love it!!! moved over 22 years ago...  and just went back for the first time.... FIRST THING i did after being dropped off at my Grandmothers house was walk over to this place.... i MISSED this food soooooo much!!!!
Calgary has some good poutins but NOTHING was like this and the grilled hotdogs and the steam hotdogs.. the subs the Smoked meat... i had to limit my  food intake because there were sooo many places i wanted to hit being back in Montreal... in the 14 days i was there i went here 9 times,  i got the cap driver to stop and i got a poutin to go .. eating it on the way to the airport...
till next time im back in \" La Belle Province\" i will be eating at \"la Belle Province\""}
{"text":"Where the French fail at artery-clogging, trashy comfort food, the Quebecois succeed. Belle Province's assembly-line fast food is just like you used to have at schoolyard barbeques, right down to the skinny hot dogs and gluey buns. But they have their own twists: I took some friends here once, who were blown away by the fact that they put sauerkraut on their burgers. Hey, it works!

This is also one of the best places to get real poutine. They give you a big styrofoam bowl with thick-cut fries layered with cheese curds, then drown it in gravy; the proportions of the three ingredients are, to my mind, just right. 

Don't get fooled by other places that give you poutine with skinny fries, or shredded cheese (wtf?), or that don't mix in the curds so they get all molten."}
{"text":"It was really good! :) The poutine was great and pretty fast service!! My only huge problem is that they don't take debit...I mean if you have enough money to pay rent on st-catherine for a restaurant..offer you clients a debit payment option, you will have so many more repeat clients! Wont be going back for that reason alone...Good place though!"}
{"text":"I have been here before and the food is delicious! the place looks retro hahaha, it makes the place feel more at home with the way Montreal looks.. I think its awesome! 

I always come here when I want poutine, its fast, tastes awesome, and pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Came for the poutine.

Decor, it is a fast food joint, so don't expect too much from the decor.  It is serviceable but we came for food, so it isn't a bit deal.

Food, I enjoyed the smoked meat poutine that we ordered.  The portion that you get is pretty large, so do make note of that when you stare at the somewhat high price tag.

Price, for the smoked meat poutine was roughly $10, while it does seem high, due note that the portion is quite large and for a snack filled 4 of us.

I wouldn't have an issue coming back although I don't think the portion size for the poutine is suitable for individual portions (need 2+ people)."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I will never EVER go back to this location, the guy serving the food was so rude!!!! Poor quality and overpriced food. I wish I could give it zero stars, this place does not deserve a 1 star."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! We had the burger, poutine, chicken burger & smoked meat sandwich while in town & all were great."}
{"text":"Poutine may be foreign to us from California, but I've had it before and I think it can be done pretty well by a fast food spot.  They've usualy got the fries down.  The meat may be questionable, but low grade fatty meat could just do the trick on this snack.  I'm pretty sure whoever thought up of poutines didn't think \"ah....I have the perfect healthy snack for young Canadians and I. AYe?\"  

No.  That person must've just had a batch of fries and thought it could need some flavor or mixture, and so on went the meat.  After a few chews, he/she wished there was something stringy to hold it together.  There tops on the cheese...any will do, let's take the easiest cheap one, mozarella.  And then with the fries getting kind of stale, let's just top that baby with some gravy.  wala!  poutine!

And all this was going through my head while I took a few delicious bites of this smoked meat poutine from this fast food joint.  Then we mosey'd on next door to the gentlemen's club.  And so goes the end of the night, or from what I could recollect."}
{"text":"Location: In the middle of the action - if you're parked anywhere near the outlets, you can walk over to La Belle Province. They do have parking, but it's quite small so you would do best to park across the street in the mall parking lot. 

Service: OK.  They do move pretty quickly when it gets busy.

La poutine: I eat poutine maybe twice a year, when I really get a hankering for it, and I usually split one with my mom - after all, what are calories if they're not shared!?  Despite wanting to get a regular, my mom decided we could totally eat the large version (I wasn't convinced) between the two of us so.... that's what we ordered. Personally, I love the fries at B-P. They don't taste like they've been cooked in old oil, aren't greasy, and are usually cooked to a golden perfection. Not too crispy, not to soft - just right for someone who eats poutine twice a year. The gravy is pretty damn good (keep in mind that I also never gravy so my POV should count for something, right?) - it's think and tasty, meshing perfectly with the cheese curds and fries. A hit, for me. My only comment is that they should add a little more sauce, and the sauce should be hotter so that the fromage melts more consistently. 

They have a terrace outside, which is a definite perk - though it can be noisy as it's on the main strip. The interior is old-school and reminds me of a diner. This B-P is probably one of the more affordable places to eat in St. Sauveur, where many restaurants are known to hike up their prices on weekends - you know, to draw in the tourists!"}
{"text":"Really Friendly Staff, and fit for working at a fast food place. I looked around and see the customers are fit too. How do you do it?
 The LBP Building looks like a home with 50's diner style retro booths, and stainless steel throughout.
 They make good Pogos (Corndog), steamees(hot dogs), Smoked Meat, Fries, Breakfast and most importantly their Poutine is awesome.
 I was with my Fiance and after working out tried the Poutine and Gyro.
 The Poutine has Great fries, good gravy and the cheese is fresh.
 The Gyro came on a Flat bread with Tatziki, onions, it was full of flavor and delish.
  We took fries home and the smell was making us hungry the whole way home.
 Great Fast food Quebec-style Love it here!"}
{"text":"Each time I have a concert at the metropolis, it is the best place to have a bite while waiting. The poutine is huge for the price. The burgers are a bit of a letdown because the buy one and get the second one 0.99$ only applies to hamburgers and not cheeseburgers. 

The food is decent, when you're in the mood for a greasy poutine. This is the place. 

I've only eaten inside once but it was clean and there was lots of room. Staff is nice. It is cash only though, which isn't convenient."}
{"text":"It's not fancy at all and the workers seem like construction workers but they were nice and the food was good. This is a better la belle province location with Poutine that taste like Poutine.  I would return here and only this location if I want a belle province Poutine."}
{"text":"Love La Belle Pro. Classic all-dressed steamies (though unfortunately no longer for 49 cents) and a great poutine, lots of delicious cheese curds and tasty gravy that isn't beefy (like New York Fries). Though the fries are a little thick-cut for me, they are still good (and greasy). I don't think they accept credit cards though, but maybe that changes from location to location."}
{"text":"Great spot for some lunch.  Just thinking about it makes me want some steamies and poutine."}
{"text":"This place is the bitch sister of good poutine places.  She promises things you like but does them half ass and lazy so you just want the date to end.  Be starving and without a palate and you'll be fine here.  

Surprisingly enough, the poutine I had at Rue peel bar was worse.  But that doesn't make this good."}
{"text":"I came to this Belle Province since I felt like an Italian Poutine and because of the incident at the Belle Province on Peel where the person at the cash, self tipped himself 25% before handing me the credit card machine, I decided to give this La Belle Province a try.

This La Belle Province is located at the corner of Ste-Catherine Street and St Laurent Boulevard. I ordered the Italian Poutine and a drink. Service was relatively fast and friendly. Negative thing about this Belle Province is that they don't accept cards of any type (no debit or credit cards) and it is strictly cash. I had cash with me so it wasn't an issue but this is something to keep in mind. They do have an independent (no name) ATM there so if you are short of cash and willing to pay (a relatively high) withdrawal service charge, you can use the machine.

The Italian Poutine was very good. It was a decent size for the price. No free soft drink refills at this place either. There is only one La Belle Province that I've visited which has free refills and that is the one near Namur metro."}
{"text":"A Montreal staple in this ghettttttoooo-ass area. 

After hittin the jiggly joints in this quarter, tear up cheap hot dogs, burgers, and poutine. 

Yuck and yum."}
{"text":"An excellent smoked meat, burger and dogs \"hut\". Quick service, good prices, there is an outdoor terrace. Park at the mall across the street. Be prepared to wait a little at peak meal times, lots of people eat here."}
{"text":"I had fond memory of this place when I was a kid and the time I ordered there is when I am extremely hungry. 

I ordered the cheeseburger, fries and drink combo. The fries were enormous and they are very generous with the quantities. The drink size is small tho. The combo cost me 10.15$. Not a bad price. 

The place was kept very clean for a fast food joint and the staffs were very organized and the service is fast."}
{"text":"I know this place isn't the fanciest, or even the prettiest, but damn if i don't love their poutine.  I had several versions (smoked meat is the best variation) on more that one occasion.  I definitely ate more than i should have.  This particular location is also in a location that makes it quite convenient to stumble into after hitting the bars down the street.

Would go back again should i find myself in the wonderful province of Quebec"}
{"text":"Decent fast food. My first ever visit to a La Belle Province after decades of Restaurant Lafleur, and if this location is any indication...Lafleurs has very little to worry about.  Still, decent and cheap and hits the spot."}
{"text":"My first poutine.  Quite possibly, my last poutine.

Was vacationing in Montreal and this place was the nearest in walking distance that advertised serving poutine.  The two hotdog meal with the bowl of poutine looked alright.  We ordered 3 (1 each).

Hotdogs were sub-mediocre.  I'd rather eat packaged hotdogs cooked on a skillet at home.  That's not a good sign.  The toppings on the hotdogs which included some pickled vegetables (a kind of saurkraut) was a bit funky.  I recommend these only if you're either high or starving.  Our excuse was the latter.

The poutine was also very blah.  I didn't imagine the fries to be so soggy and burnt.  And when they are in that condition, the gravy just helps form a mortar-like paste so that you have to dig and dig with your fork to break it all apart.  Make a note of this:  You cannot use that fork in your esophagus, so eat wisely.  I have a feeling that if I ate any more of this stuff that a Cardiac surgeon would need to jab a fork into my aorta.

We came here because it was convenient, and we wanted to see what all the kids ate when on a budget.  The expectations weren't very high, but we had a meal.  It was, a meal.  Plain and simple.  I kind of didn't want to eat for the next day and I'm just thankful that I didn't order some of the more exotic abominations on the menu (such as that giant family-sized plate of poutine).

It's cheap, but you get what you pay for here.  Poo-tine."}
{"text":"This is one of the best La Belle Province in Quebec. You can tell they really pride themselves in keeping the place clean. Open late and service is always friendly and fast. They do things with a certain flare to it. Whether it's opening the bag or putting that hot-dog in the bun, it's done with style. Food is great. The pics will say it all."}
{"text":"The food is good, the price is a little above the quality but overall it's a decent place for a late night snack or meal. The poutine is great but not the best in Montreal according to locals."}
{"text":"I never had anything here besides the poutine, but that was fine with me. It has one of my favorite versions of the dish, even though the \"gravy\" seems to be of questionable origins. If serving a group, it can be economical to get one big serving of poutine and then some extra fries - I agree that the gravy and cheese are well-proportioned, but they can also be rationed out over multiple servings."}
{"text":"Now I Empathy with Dave, The poor guy!

I use to go to this place every week as a teenage with my friend. The Area has lot of nice Punk band, Metal T-shirt. As a rebellious hardcore punk kid, this was the PIT to fuel up on some cheap, stomach killer food where hygiene wasn't a necessity.  There dog's were always half decent but it felt like cheap hot-dog saucages, i mean, when you're trying to save money by getting the cheap sausage, Houston, WE GOT A PROBLEM! 

What's wrong except insalubrity all over the place?
The recipe for a good poutine is some good sauce which it's not the case: Extremly hot sauce properbly overcooked 20 times. Some greasy fries: One Shake to remove the Old 12213089 y o oil and BANG on the side ready to serve!
Then a BUCKET (literally) of curd  cheese in the fridge. 
Curd cheese particularity is that the little milk (petit lait) is creating a salty and fresh squish-squish taste. By putting the Curd cheese in the refrigerator the little milk gets in the cheese and the effect is not longer there. The only thing that a not-hygienic restaurant can do easiely right is wrong here! 

This franchise should be closed for insalubrity or simply for serving crap!"}
{"text":"THE BELLE PRO IS NO LONGER AT THIS LOCATION. It is now a police station - no word yet on the quality of their poutine, but the early returns are looking good. Basically, if this location comes up as an option when you're downtown and needing a poutine, don't go. Because it's not there. Do go to another Belle Pro however. This review is less a knock on Belle Pro and more a knock on Yelp for including out of date information."}
{"text":"My first poutine.

Before coming to Montreal, everyone was telling me, \"You have to try the poutine.\" Cheese curds and gravy over fries? It sounds it could be a winning combo, but the one I had at La Belle Province (chain store, kind of like a Canadian Weinersnitchel) could use a little work. Maybe there's better poutine shops. Or maybe that's just the way it is. Or maybe (and more likely) it's because I've had All-American chili cheese fries back in the States! Go USA! They also sell  hot dogs in a roll or wrapped in toast bread... both suck.

Tips: I guess you have to try it once. Locations are everywhere."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some late night food after the club or bar. A lot of food, very filling. 

Recommendations:

Classic Poutine"}
{"text":"GREAT \"poutine\".  It sounds a little odd, but get it!  French fries, covered in \"gravy\" and cheese curds.  It is more like fries covered in an indecribable delicious sauce, with chunks of cheese that melt all over everything.  This is about a 5 minute walk from the Beaudry metro station."}
