{"text":"First time there and very impressed, ambience, service, food, you couldn't ask for anything more.  It truly is a little gem in \"Old Port Credit\" ....take advantage. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"A seriously great restaurant.  Definitely a hidden gem.  If you haven't been here go now!  The food is amazing!  Everything is made from scratch.  Starting with the fresh baked breads and homemade butter.  Service is awesome.  I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Absolutely.  Amazing food and staff.   Lost a good waiter recently as he left the country.   But his replacement is very flirty. (:    At least he was with me.  Been coming here a lot.  Food is fantastic.   A little on the noisy side. Wine list is good.   Nice little hidden gem just east of Hurontario Roy and Kelly will take care of you."}
