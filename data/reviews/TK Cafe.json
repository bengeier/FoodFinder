{"text":"I work just a few block away from this place and there's not a lot of options on this side of Tryon for food. If there were more convenient food options they'd see my business go away. The only reason they receive 3 stars is because of the salad bar. You fill out a slip of paper to customize and build your own salad and those are always great. The sandwiches are nothing special. For the descriptions they offer the actual product is always bland. The sides are only decent and they are very small. If you're looking for a quick lunch option I would recommend the salad bar but not much else. Be sure to check your order before you leave. Several times they've forgotten parts of my order and my box includes a sandwich with no side or a salad without the meat option that I chose and paid an additional cost for."}
{"text":"This place gets it. Sandwiches are DELICIOUS. My favorite is the Southern. It's utterly perfect. The wait is never long, and everything tastes very fresh. They have excellent salads as well. The only thing that me and my coworkers have never particularly enjoyed are the sides. We end up getting chips, because, frankly, we all agree that the sides are not on the same level as the sandwiches, and really just aren't that tasty. All that said, it is a FANTASTIC local place to grab a very high quality, affordable, delicious lunch."}
{"text":"Quick lunch today with co-workers, Blazing chicken spinach wrap was on point with just the right amount of heat with a slaw that complimented perfectly! Pasta salad was a good side but very small on portions. Would have been 4 stars but place was empty and we had to wait for a long time. Overall fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"Since my last post I have see a great deal of effort come from the management to make the client experience a good one. Management no longer sit at customer tables and the guy who works the front is much more pleasant in the mornings when I get my coffee. I appreciate the effort management has put into pleasing their customers."}
{"text":"(O'Dell Building).  Though pointed out several times, they couldnt care less about peanut cross-contamination or labelling for their cookie/muffin container.  A simple label and keeping the peanut items in the bottom while not overlaying the with other items is all it would take.  As for coffee, they made the financial (really, I asked) decision to not have half and half available.  A minor thing, i know, but charge the extra 10 cents a cup instead of the gas station plastic synthetic white stuff.  For food prep, the small things matter and give customers insight into the larger stuff that we cant see.  Skimping on basics and ignoring customer safety us not a good business model."}
{"text":"Have not had anything bad here yet.  They have unique flavor combinations and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and good price. With the $5 for $10 deal and check in offer, we end up paying another $2 for two people's breakfast (2 sandwich+2 fruit+2 coffee)."}
{"text":"After finding this place and parking (it's tucked away in the courtyard behind the 525 N Tyron Building) I was upset to not be impressed with my sandwich...at all. 

I called in my order - SouthWest Turkey Panini on Foccacia with Chipotle Aioli, Pickled Onions, Guacamole, and Smoked Gouda ($8) as well as a smoothie ($3) and used the $5 for $10 Yelp coupon...what a deal! The sandwich was ready when I arrived but the smoothie was not...not a big deal, but the line was long and with only two people working on front, they seemed very rushed and stressed.

For starters, the sandwich was warm but was by no means panini grilled. In addition, you can see from the picture, there was hardly any guacamole or gouda cheese, and no aioli. The only discernible tastes were the red onion, which was extremely overwhelming, the turkey, which was plentiful, and the thick, tough bread. The quinoa cous cous on the side was fine, I wasn't expecting to love it and just wanted something healthy.

I did enjoy sitting on the patio in front of the fountains and felt transported out of the inner city for a few moments. This seemed to be a very convenient spot for those that work in the neighborhood.

After enjoying my tacos from their food truck was excited to try this place but was extremely disappointed. What a bummer because everything on the menu looks delicious. If I lived or worked walking distance, I might try again...but in my case, unfortunately no."}
{"text":"This is a decent, convenient place for breakfast and lunch. It is in the first floor of the building I work in when I am in Charlotte, which has been almost every week the last 2-3 months. The breakfast is good and made to order- I've had omelets and breakfast biscuits - but it is not fast. Expect to wait 10-15 minutes.  I believe you can call ahead and have it ready, but I have not done that. Many times I'll just grab a hot tea, premade fruit cup and a granola bar. The various cashiers are always friendly and helpful.

The only thing I have ever gotten for lunch is the made-to-order salad. You fill out a form with the size of salad you want (side or full), the vegetables/condiments you want (all included - no limit) and then pay extra if you want a protein. It's a good salad and they don't skimp on the protein you choose.

They also have a rewards program - for every 5 visits you get a free coffee.

I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but for those who work close by it's a good alternative."}
{"text":"For some reason, they cannot seem to remain open for the posted hours.  That is the biggest problem this \"restaurant\" has.  It is actually pretty good for what It is; a short order diner.  The salads are fresh and sandwiches are pretty good, but they also run out of things a lot as well.

I like the food and it's convenient,  but it's a huge disappointment to leave your desk and take the elevator downstairs eagerly anticipating your meal...only to find out that they don't have an item on the menu or that they are not open in the middle of the day or that they closed early for some odd reason."}
{"text":"TK food truck is always a hit, and love the buffalo cauliflower tacos.  But want to also take a minute to give a shout out to TK Cafe downtown.  Friendly, attentive staff and I always get the portobello mushroom wrap.  Soooo good.  Kinda tucked away on the backside of 525 N Tryon bldg, but worth a visit."}
{"text":"First time here. Just wanted a quick breakfast bite. Toast and side of bacon.
Both were good and took just a couple minutes."}
{"text":"I am not feeling the greatest today so my friend brought over soup and sandwiches for lunch from TK cafe. I swear I already feel better. Tomato soup was delicious and the tuna sandwich was a perfect complement. Yummy! When I'm back to feeling like myself I look forward to heading over and eating at the cafe instead of my kitchen counter for the full experience."}
{"text":"I work in this building, so it's very convenient to grab lunch here. I am actually really impressed with this little cafe. 
I ordered a turkey bacon club and asked for it without the honey mustard. The deli meat is boars head which is really important to me... it's my favorite!
There was no line when I went in so I ordered with the friendly man behind the counter. It was a little under $10 for my sandwich and my choice of side, I ordered the feta, onion, tomato salad. 
After a very short wait, my sandwich was ready! I took it back to my desk, although there are tables in there. 
The breakfast options looked great too - which is great in the case that I don't bring my breakfast one day. 
So happy there is a convenient little cafe so close to work!"}
{"text":"Convenient lunch spot for those of us working toward the north side of uptown. Located in the Odell building facing the courtyard. 

The tinfamous is my top choice, but have only had a few things on the menu so far. They also have scones, muffins, and other pastries - great for midday snacks.  Each sandwich comes with a side; I usually go with the pasta salad. The sandwich and side come boxed up and ready to go. 

The line can get long during the lunch rush, but they do a good job of getting people in and out quick. 

Lunch will run you close to $10 - so a bit more than a Jimmy John's or fast food, but the ingredients and recipes make it a good value."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick lunch. Sandwiches, soups, and salads.  Fast service although everything is prepared to order.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Love the peanut butter and banana smoothie with weigh protein. Gets me through the day on a busy schedule. Staff is awesome and courteous."}
