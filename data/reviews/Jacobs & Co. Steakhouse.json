{"text":"One of the better steakhouses I've been to in Toronto, great selection of beef with some good seafood pairings. This is a very upscale restaurant, and service is great. I definitely recommend the ceaser salad, completely made in front of you (even the mayo!)."}
{"text":"Like many of our fellow Yelpers have stated, this is a great steakhouse. Service and atmosphere are good (despite the waitress forgetting to explain the steak sauces to us and forgetting some cutlery). Like all high end steak houses, steaks and sides are ordered a la cart. Steaks are quite expensive ranging from ~$39 - $350. I ordered the Norfolk ribeye ($65) and my husband ordered a filet from California (~$150). I preferred my steak at half of his price. They start you off with some bread poppers which were delicious! We ordered the caesar salad which is prepared tableside - it was delicious and had real pancetta/bacon which was good, but I found a little too salty. Ordered sides of mushrooms and duck fat fries - they were both ok and for sides of $15 and up, I expected better. The desserts are huge and more manageable for sharing after eating all that meat - we ordered the creme brule and it was delicious. The meal ended with complimentary muffins to take home and \"petit de fours\". A very good experience overall. For the price though, I'm not sure I would return (but then again, I'm not a huge fan of steakhouses). For a party of 4 with about 5 alcoholic beverages the price was over $600. If you are a big meat eater and enjoy steakhouses, this place is definitely for you."}
{"text":"It hurts me to give Jacobs & Co only 4 stars - the steaks are second to none in Toronto, but the service was extremely poor across my multiple visits to this restaurant. 

I dined at Jacobs twice in March 2015 and both times we experienced the same inadequate service. Examples of issues: cutlery falling when replacing plates, dirty forks and knives, having to ask multiple times for water refills and general lack of service (we had to actually walk away from our table to find someone to bring the credit card machine). I usually am not that picky when it comes to the dining experience, but when the meals were close to and over $1000, I hoped for at least satisfactory service. Also, there were fruit flies both times I visited - possibly because we were seated near the oyster bar, but I don't think that should be an excuse. 

Service aside, the steaks were excellent and extremely memorable. The Japanese wagyu literally melts in your mouth and the 'regular' cuts of meat were top notch. If you don't like the extreme fattiness of the Japanese wagyu but also want the intense extra flavor that the fat provides, consider ordering the steaks from Snake River Farms. These hybrid steaks have the firmness of a 'regular' steak and also have the extra fat content which gives the wagyu feel (they are cheaper than Japanese wagyu as well).

The service isn't a deal breaker for me since the food was so outstanding, but I hope my dining experience will be better the next time I visit Jacobs & Co. 

Food - 9.5/10
Service - 6/10

Overall - 8/10"}
{"text":"Best steak house ambiance I've ever experienced.  A modern feel but with proper space between tables.

The bar is also excellent with a piano player usually creating a relaxing mood. 

Table side Caesar was delicious.

Service in general is impeccable!

I've had better filets so I might try the strip or rib eye next time."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service. Gold star!           The server was very patient and explained everything thorough to me. Waygu beef was very impressive!       Conclusion: totally worth your money :)"}
{"text":"Best steak in my entire life.

I really tried to splurge when we went and it was worth every penny (or every $100 bill, haha).

I ordered different cuts and different qualities of beef:
- 8oz US angus ribeye
- 10oz American wagyu sirloin 
- 8oz A5 black Tajima Japanese wagyu (chefs choice)

The Japanese A5 is the closest I'll ever get to Kobe beef (unless I go there myself) and this meat tasted like butter. My only regret was eating the A5 before the American wagyu because although it tasted great, it just could not compare.

Service was great and the ambiance was damn near perfect. 

Definitely go to Jacobs if you're ready to splurge and have some of the best beef in your life."}
{"text":"Steak was very good. Not the best I had, but service was top notch. Order wagyu steak and 60 day aged. Overall a very good experience"}
{"text":"Being from Dallas I can't believe I had to come all the way to Toronto to eat one of the top steakhouses in North America! 
I have to say the sneak river tenderloin was off the charts incredible!
Shrimp cocktail for the appetizer was perfect .....loved the loaded baked potato..... The blueberry cheesecake toped off an incredible meal!
Unbelievable wine list and most importantly the service was six star!
The best waitress there is Ayana!
She knows the menu"}
{"text":"I had a porterhouse steak here and although it was a little bit on the pricey side it was very good! Very juicy with interesting sauces to match.  I have tried most of the top steakhouses in Toronto and Jacobs is definitely in the top 5.  I believe I saw Kobe steak on the menu as well! Speaking of Kobe, Jose Calderon was sitting next to us.  When I went it was a younger crowd in their 30's-40's.     

From what I recall there's a piano bar lounge downstairs and upstairs is where the restaurant is.  The decor is modern but not too stuffy.  A good place to take a SO for a nice night out of if you want to satisfy a streak craving."}
{"text":"I have been to Jacob twice and had mixed experience - first time I would give 2 stars and second time 3 stars.  Basically, I feel the quality of the food and especially the steak is still not as refined and lack the 'oomph' I often get at steak houses in the US- Chicago Chop House,  Gibsons, Prime, St. Elmo, Peter Ludger, etc. And the service at those restaurants are almost over the top. And their steaks are always 10/10.
However, dinner this time at Jacob was splendid - attentive service from reception to departure made the experience memorable.  The Waygu steak was cooked expertly and my favourite cut the ribeye was cooked perfectly.  
The martini was mixed perfectly and extra olives was offered almost instantly.  Well done!"}
{"text":"I tried the Aged steak, and a half lobster.
It was great!
The surprise would be the Cesar salad, in which they make right in front of you.
If you are there with friends, order one for sure.The price is good for it (the salad i mean)
The lobster is tasty, and priced moderately. The main course would be the steak of course.
I had the 30 days aged stake and i found it to be really good.
Overall, it was a great experience. The service was also great."}
{"text":"FOOD WASN'T HOT AND THEY DIDNT REALLY CARE


The first time I went to Jacobs was phenomenal. The server was knowledgeable and very detailed. He even wiped the crumbs off our table in between dishes. Since then I had sworn that Jacobs is the best steak house in town. 

I had returned yesterday to celebrate my 21st birthday and it was probably the worse fine dining experience I've ever had. Our reservation was at 10 ( an hr before the kitchen closes) we were seated immediately. After looking at the menu my boyfriend and i ordered two 4oz japanese wagyus, half a dozen oysters, a whole lobster, mash potatoes and their Jacobs caesar salad. 

Our server did not bother to explain the cut or steak to us in any way. When i asked about the oysters he just gave me a long list but didn't take the time to explain their flavour profile or anything. He just swiftly jot our order down and left. 

We got the cheddar poppers which didn't seem very fresh this time. After a while our oysters came ( not that great either )followed by our salad. The guy who made our salad didn't ask if it was our first time or anything he just said \" need me to explain everything?\"

After waiting quite a while our steaks, lobster and mash came out a little after 11. My steak tasted like a chunk of fat. I understand its suppose to be \"melt in your mouth tender\" but not \" melt in your mouth fat\". Our sever wizzed by and asked if everything was okay and left before i can even take in how something was off about our food. 

My boyfriend then pointed out that his steak was cold. I took another bite of mine and realized it was barely on the warm side. I took a bite of our lobster and it was actually cold.. not even warm. Our mash was the only thing that was hot.

It took us a while to flag down our server since he was so busy cleaning and trying to close. When we finally got his attention we told him the lobster was cold and he said he will re-blanch it for us though it will result in a slight rubbery texture. We hesitated to tell him about our steaks as we didn't want to trouble him and we knew the kitchen was closed. 

When he returned with the lobster  we decided to let him know about the steaks as it wasn't even worth eating anymore we barely had two slices of it. We explained to him that it was cold and we just wanted to let him know for future reference. He said he would go speak to his supervisor and the kitchen. 

Came back and questioned us about the steak actually being cold saying how its not supposed to be hot. I told him i know steaks are suppose to rest after cooking and that I've eaten here before so i know. He still continued to question us. After all that he just said they cant do anything because we didn't tell him soon enough and that they would've taken the temperature to see if it was actually cold. He obviously didn't believe me. After all that he gave us one complementary creme brûlée and that was it. On top of all that he couldn't even send us off with their complimentary muffins that everyone else received.

Overall, i think he just didn't take us seriously, probably thought since we were young we didn't know anything and wouldn't tip him good anyway. Plus the kitchen was closed they just wanted us out of there.  Thanks for a shitty dinner @ Jacobs&co!"}
{"text":"Please, dress to impress. At least that is the impression it gives. There is valid parking available at a fee ($). The entrance to the front doors are all wooden and gives a very comfortable impression. The live piano bar is absolutely beautiful. You must have a drink at the bar, this is recommended by Me.  The is more of the restaurant on the upper level, a typical layout you will find in downtown. You  must try their T-Bone meat, which can average anywhere from $70 to over $100 if I remember. Anyways, the waiters are exceptionally trained well. Poor service to the washrooms (broken down). Expect to pay well over a couple of hundreds of dollars in one night. A very posh restaurant."}
{"text":"I realize I'm against the grain of reviews here.  That said, as someone who travels for a living I truly expected more from Jacobs.  I sat up at the upstairs bar to have dinner alone and was very pleased with the service and atmosphere.  I then ordered a Manhattan and quickly noticed little flies around the bar.  Decided not to care at this point until my food started to come and the little flies increased in quantity.  My hand swiping motion (goal of swatting the flies away) in the air was noticed by the bartender who came over and mentioned this was due to the cherry juice being \"full of sugar\". I quickly finished my meal (left a 15-20% tip) and walked out.  The manager or lead host at the door asked how my meal was when I was walking out....I debated on telling him for a second as I really wanted to leave... Then caved and told him my concern.  He apologized and then walked away.  Later that evening I became so sick in my hotel room.  The next morning I left a message for the general manager in their vmail box asking for a call back and heard NOTHING back."}
{"text":"One of the premiere steak places in Toronto.  Not only do they have great sourcing for their meat, it's wonderfully aged and the servers are extremely knowledgeable about it all and can discuss it at length.  Having a Caesar salad made freshly in front of you is a unique experience that really adds to date night and the bread is also tasty.  Whatever your taste in steak, Jacob's can satisfy."}
{"text":"I have high expectations when I enter a Jacobs & Company type establishment.  

I expect that when I have a 9pm reservation that my table be ready within a reasonable amount of time.  I expect a prompt drink at the bar while I'm waiting. I expect the cut of meat that I ask for to be available and I expect that meat to be cooked in a way that I so choose.  

When you fail to meet these pedestrian standards you should expect a poor review."}
{"text":"Not enough can be said about this place. The service is impeccable and the food is excellent. I am not a filet kind of guy but Jacobs pricy, little piece of meat is worth every penny (and you won't go wrong with the rib steak either). The Caesar Salad and Duck Fat Fries are must sides."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try their organic steak and I did,and it was...AMAZING! It's from a farm in Ontario,the flavor of the steak doesn't taste as beefy as regular steak, but mild and smooth. It was perfectly cooked, very juicy and tender. I got totally blown away.
The servers are very welcoming and patient, they also recommended this red wine(photo posted) for us that went perfectly with our steak.
Will definitely go back again soon!"}
{"text":"Best steak house in Toronto hands down, table side Caesar is a must!! Great place for business or special occasion, nice bar to have a drink at first."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday last year and it was an amazing dinner. I had the 40 oz steak while my friends had 180 aged day steaks. The 40 oz was good but the 180 day was like butter in my mouth. It was smooth and tender. If you have ever ate pork belly at a Hakka restaurant you will know what I am talking about. You should try the duck fat fries and Cesar salad, the Cesar was one of the best I have ever had in the city.

The atmosphere was nice and classy and it had an intimate feeling. This place is great for groups and I highly recommend it for a party. The location is great with it being in the heart of downtown. If you want to grab drinks, see a show or go bowling it is a few minutes away.

The service was great; the waiter was attentive and was always there when we wanted something."}
{"text":"Highly overrated. Very odd atmosphere. It's quiet with kind of plain/simple decor. Steaks were pretty good but they don't live up to the hype. It was neat to see the Caesar salad being made in front of you and some of the sides were quite good (duck fat fries)... but the steaks were nowhere near as good as some of the reviews on here say (my striploin was way overcooked). Unless you're going for the high end Kobe beef you are better off just going to the Keg (much cheaper and similar quality). 

Our server was basically a yes-man and provided very little insight into the food. The staff at the front also took over 5 minutes to find our jackets. 

Overall, it's a solid high-end steakhouse with quality ingredients but I can't justify the cost."}
{"text":"I went there with my husband and we ordered the seafood platter for 2 and steak.  I was blown away when the seafood platter came.  There were lobsters, oysters, jumbo shrimps, tuna tar tar and much more.  

The ambiance was great and service was excellent.  The steak was very tender and I love how it was served on a cast iron pan.  On a side note it was a little pricey.  Overall I would go back again."}
{"text":"Absolute, best steak in Toronto and best steak I have ever had.  I ordered Australian Wagyu Striploin it was absolutely cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The steak practically melts in your mouth due to the amazing fat marbling in the meat.  What I notice in particular with Jacobs versus other steak houses is how the meat is cooked.  You will notice, or at least, I first noticed that the steak was evenly cooked to my liking which was medium rare.   Then there was a even perfect sear on the outside of the meat.  I have no clue how they pulled it off but this is what I find that puts Jacobs above the rest.  Other steak houses, you will find a bulls-eye affect where the middle is how you like it cooked, but then gradually towards the out side it becomes medium and then well-done.

We also got the table side Caesar salad which was entertaining and the dressing tasted great.  I would like to have had he sardines chopped out so that it is spread out throughout the salad.

The poutine fried in duck-fat was not anything amazing, but sounded amazing on the menu.

We also ordered Canadian rib-eye.  Although good, it was not anything compared to the wagyu.  Next time, I am going to opt for a better cut of wagyu or kobe to be shared between two and one-side."}
{"text":"Caesar salad was something else! An absolute must!
Brussel sprouts & potato gratin both to die for and are perfect with the US ribeye! 
Was not too happy about the cocktails - I got the orange spritz which was not delicious (Originally wanted the bombay sapphire mix, but found it to be too expensive for a cocktail drink - $20!). 
Service was impeccable. Our server was Jay who was attentive, who knew everything on the menu, gave recos and was just a delight to have around."}
{"text":"Our first time at Jacobs was dinner for 2.  Steaks were excellent and we shared a stuffed baked potato my wife is still talking about.  It's not cheap but for a nice night out we were not disappointed.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best experiences at a steakhouse. 

It starts with the environment. The restaurant is elegant and polished, with cool decor that radiated class and luxury. I'd say I was pretty presentable that day, but walking into the dining room, I immediately felt under-dressed and intimidated. But that immediately melted away once we were seated at one of the booths around the perimeter of the restaurant. They were so comfy!

Next thing to commend upon is the service. Simply impeccable! I don't know how the waiter knows so much about beef, but he just did. I dare you to try to find something about cattle that they don't know.

The meal starts off right when a plate of poppovers and herb butter arrive. They are essentially yorkshire puddings, and they are SO GOOD. The tops have a nice flakey crunch, and were delicious with the herb butter melted on it.

To balance off the barrage of meat and potatoes that would be soon served to us, we decided a salad would be a good idea. The most prized salad is the Jacob's Caesar Salad ($15) made entirely from scratch next to your table. A highly recommended order!

They serve a variety of very sharable sides, and our party of 6 ordered a couple to try:
Potato Gratin ($12) -with cheddar and shallots
Stuffed Baked Potato ($15) -waygu brisket, oka cheese, 
Duck Fat French Fries ($12) -with tarragon

The Stuffed Baked Potato was about the biggest potato I've ever seen. It was like a small foot ball! But by far the Duck Fat French Fries were my favorite. Really rich in flavour, and I enjoyed dipping them into all the different condiments that came with the steak.

Steaks:
14 oz Ribeye ($48)
40 oz USDA Prime Porterhouse ($120)

All of their steaks are char-broiled in cast iron pans. This is the key to their great tasting steaks. The cast iron reaches the perfect scorching 1,800°F temperature to crust the exterior and retain juices, while the flat pan allows for even heat distribution.

And let me tell you, you could really tell the difference. These steaks were AMAZING. The combination of a good cut of meat and perfect cooking technique made these steaks so tender and flavourful. It explains why they don't use serrated knives, because you don't even need one to cut through the meat! I'm not a huge carnivore, but I throroughly enjoyed each and every bite.

By a big margin, Jacobs & Co Steakhouse is one of the better steakhouses I've been to in Toronto. I wouldn't hesitate for one second to return if it didn't cost such a pretty penny. But everyone splurges once in a while, right? Definitely put this one away for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing service from the manager, sales, and reservations booking department. Would not accommodate large party more than a month in advance without an extravagant minimum spend. As a long time Jacobs customer, I am surprised and disappointed. Won't book here again if they don't want our business!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best steak we've ever had! What really made the experience 5 star for us was the awesome hospitality of the staff - Carl at the oyster bar, provided absolutely flawless service, fantastic steak knowledge and awesome conversation throughout the meal and Phillip the host is a true English gentleman - both are true assets to Jacobs! We look forward to more great food and conversation next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Food ordered: Cesar salad to share, steak, fish, duck fat fries to share, and dessert

Service was impeccable and because I was pregnant and couldn't eat raw eggs, they offered to use avocado in the Cesar salad instead. 

The cheese puffs they serve as bread was absolutely delicious. 

The steak was served on a hot plate. My husband is a slow eater and by the end of the meal his medium rare steak was well done.

However next time we will park our own car as valet parking was $19 of which they add to the bill and we paid HST and tip on that. 

We are not big eaters so when we return we will stick with the Cesar salad and one main and we would still be full. :)"}
{"text":"Best steak I've ever had. A group of us ordered the Japanese A5 and it was amazing. It almost literally melts in your mouth and is incredibly flavorful. 

We also tried the wagyu and Canadian beef. The beef comes out family style so you can enjoy different kinds which I really appreciated. 

The duck fat fries and gratin were delicious. 

Be prepared to spend for your quality meat and wine though...There's one cut of steak that is $350. Yipes."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place!  It's not cheap but this is one of the cases where you do get what you pay for.  I had the A5 Black Tajima-Kagoshima Prefecture California cut and it was amazing! Literally just melted in my mouth, it's very rich so best to share an 8 oz with a companion with some side dishes.   Aside from the steaks, I would come back just for their famous Caesar salad (prepared tableside) and forget the bread, they serve complimentary Yorkshire pudding which is the best thing since slice bread (haha) but seriously when they put so much attention to complimentary \"bread\" imagine the dishes you do have to pay for  -- it's worth it."}
{"text":"It's a nice \"high class\" restaurant. The atmosphere is very classy that it's a quiet place you can really talk with who you're eating with. Almost any girlfriend/wife would  be pretty happy if the man brings her here for dinner. Personally really like the crab salad for appetizer even though it's tiny."}
{"text":"I had one of the best dining experiences here. The service is impeccable and the steaks are the best I've encountered in Toronto.

My boyfriend and I spontaneously visited one evening and was greeted by the friendliest staff ever. They asked if it was our first time and I replied that it was mine. Since they could only accommodate us in the piano lounge (located right by the entrance) we were offered a tour of the rest of the place. The gesture was so sweet! After seeing the dining area, private rooms, and oyster bar I'd definitely recommend making reservations to ensure that you get a seat upstairs in the dining area. Don't get me wrong, the piano lounge is very nice too, but it seems better suited for sipping cocktails (which are great by the way!) rather than eating a meal. 

To start we had a caesar salad prepared table-side! Nothing like a little entertainment to work up an appetite. The table-side preparation really made you feel special as neighbouring tables watched in awe and envy. The salad was not just a feast for the eyes, but it tasted great too!

For my main I ordered a 48 day-aged 8 oz. California Cut Striploin USDA Prime Black Angus from Nebraska, USA. The steak was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. It was served with three types of salts and 3 different sauces. The salts really stole the show as they heightened the flavour of the steak.

With so many sides to choose from, we finally settled on duck fat fries and sauteed mushrooms. Both choices were excellent and I can't wait to come back to try their other selections.

We unfortunately had to skip dessert, but thankfully they give the most delicious muffins to take home. They were perfect with coffee the next morning.

If you're a steak lover in Toronto this is definitely the place to be. Don't be intimidated by the setting or the prices. The outstanding service will put you at ease and some steaks are actually very reasonably priced. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We've been to many great steakhouses around the world. Jacob's is now among our favourites anywhere. From the moment we walked in, the service was stellar. I started with some very fresh oysters from PEI and BC and then my wife and I shared a fabulous table side Caesar salad. It was made perfectly - and it was a very generous portion. We wrestled with the amazing selection of steaks. It was hard to not choose something from the wagyu list. Since my wife loves tenderloin but I prefer a rib eye or strip steak, we decided to split the 25oz, 75 day dry aged T-bone steak from Nebraska. We had duck fat fries and mushrooms as sides. 

The sides were fine - but the steak was amazing. So much flavour. So tender and juicy. It was all pre-cut which allowed my wife to select the pieces slightly more done. She even loved the strip steak side. It was fun to try with the different salts and sauces but it was actually best just as is. Really one of the best steaks I've ever had. 

They got word it was my birthday so our order of creme  brûlée came with a nice birthday greeting. To top off this great meal was probably the best creme brûlée we've ever had. 

My only regret was that next time I think we'll skip the sides and just try two or three different steaks. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday.  Had one of the best Makers Mark Manhattan's I have ever had.  Loved the meat locker and the modern, clean lines of the place.  Ran into a few hockey players in the bar area.  

Totally agree with comments about the caesar salads.  Awesome.  Everything was awesome.  Go.  Now."}
{"text":"The restaurant outside is low key, we barely notice it. But inside has the best atmosphere. 1st floor is the bar with a pianist playing, very enjoyable. Very good service, even though the nice server mistakenly pour a little wine inside my salad. I didn't take the offer for a new dish. 25 oz T-bone Guelph under medium-well is very juicy as recommended by the experienced server, shared by 2 of us. Mushroom side dish is delicious too, just too full to finish it, so skip the dessert after."}
{"text":"The only restaurant worthy of 5 stars because every time I have been to this restaurant, the steaks have been delicious (I've been trying a new one every time), the service is consistent and not pretentious, the waiters and waitresses know their menu and their wine. I appreciate it all. The only item I didn't like once was the stale popcorn on top of their creamed corn but that tiny error isn't enough to drop my rating/recommendation. Oh, and they are really accommodating of possible special instructions/ accommodations with our reservations. Solid place. My absolute favourite Steakhouse in Toronto."}
{"text":"Best steak in the city - been here many times and have never been disappointed - always has great service and the meat is awesome no matter which cut and from where you pick your steak from the vast array of choices. Definitely the best steakhouse in the city. Great Caesar salad made fresh at your table - must try as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Jacobs is my favourite restaurant in the city and is usually reserved for special occasions. It's very expensive, but worth every penny.

I was there last Wednesday night and the bill came to $600 for two of us, including pre-meal drinks, dinner, dessert, wine, scotch and a generous tip. Everything was top notch. I had two excellent martinis, shrimp cocktail, steak aged over 50 days, mashed potatoes, broccoli, bottle of Brunello, desert, and a glass of scotch. I was not let down at any point. In fact, it's hard to not overdue it, since it's all so good.

This place is about steak and they are excellent. There are cuts from Angus, Hereford, Wagyu that are aged up to over 100 days. It's a steak lovers paradise. The steak is served cut and sharing in encouraged. It easy to order a couple of steaks and compare the taste of each.

The wine list is extensive and has many available at all price points, although they start at 100 to 150 per bottle and go to over 1000++.

Service is excellent and very personable. I've been to the restaurant several times and from the time you walk in until you leave you feel comfortable and at ease. The staff are very knowledgable and have no pretenses in dealing with you."}
{"text":"Have been to Jacobs a handful of times and I have never had a bad experience. The food is absolutely delicious. Their Caesar salad made in front you is a must. Best I have ever had to be honest. Steak options are plentiful and come cooked to perfection. The Wagyu selections are always a smart choice. Sides are ordered to share and compliment the meal perfectly. The duck fat fries are soooo good! Desserts if you have any room left have all been outstanding. Please stop by if you want a delicious meal in one of the best steakhouses in the city. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The Caesar salad is really great and so are the steaks, of course. The ambience is pleasant even when the place is busy, which is most evenings from what I can tell. Really can't go wrong if you're looking for a special place."}
{"text":"I've been lucky enough to have eaten here a couple times, very nice restaurant, classy modern  clean decor, does not feel overwhelming. Service has always been great. The ceasar salad is made fresh at your table and may be the best ceasar I have ever had, the ceasar salad alone is enough to keep me coming back. Their steaks are unbelievable, the duck confit fries are delicious. The portions are generous. The icing on the whole experience are the delicious complimentary muffins you receive at the end of the evening.  The have gorgeous private dining rooms."}
{"text":"A couple of years ago Morton's was our favorite steakhouse in Toronto. This has since changed and now Jacobs and Co is by far number 1 standing head and shoulders above the competition.
The quality of food exceeds expectations. The servers are very knowledgeable and friendly. The overall ambiance is classy and light unlike the stuffy feeling at other high end places.
This is our go to place for special occasions and you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were so looking forward to our dinner here being recommended by a long time Toronto Resident.  They stuck us upstairs by the wall with someone so close to us we could hear everything they said. It was very dark. The 140 day dry aged rib eye was 40 per cent fat.  We were told it was where it was cut from.  We complained and they brought us another piece of meat totally different flavor and color. We were very disappointed in our steaks.  Never saw a manager We ordered a Local wine which was good and Sommelier was very knowledgeable. We were very disappointed and will probably not go back."}
{"text":"I met the parents in Toronto for U.S. Thanksgiving. This place is great! I would fly to Toronto, just to enjoy a meal here again!

We all had the Cesare Salad. It is prep'd to order table side, fresh garlic and pepper are prominent. The waiter (Henri) was great, he explained dry aging to my mother (who isn't a big fan of red meat) as well as going into the regiospecific differences between the cuts we could choose from that evening. 


We ended up ordering a couple of larger cuts, from different regions to compare /contrast the differences in flavor. We tried the PEI bone in ribeye, vs a large corn fed no bone ribeye from Nebraska. As far as side dishes went, we only ordered the Duck Fat fries and a local kale sautéed with walnuts and blue cheese that was excellent!

Both steaks came out cooked to perfection, the PEI bone in, a thicker cut was cooked medium rare plus, and the Nebraska Ribeye med rare, was prepared Pittsburgh style. Both were served in individual iron skillets and sliced so we could help our selves, picking and choosing between the two cuts. In Dallas, a great steak will set you back about sixty dollars at your better places. (Bob's Chamberlains, etc.) but spending $120 + on a steak at Jacobs is money well spent!

I honestly would have been happy returning here just for a meal of appetizers...they all looked so great! 

Seriously, if you are coming to Toronto for a few days consider heading to Jacobs to have cocktails and appetizers at the bar one evening, get a feel for the menu and then have a top of the line steak dinner on your second visit!"}
{"text":"Wow... the steaks are phenomenal but quite expensive. Still, your mouth will thank you!

The wine selection is ridiculously long, so if you're a connoisseur, you can have some fun perusing page after page of selections most of us would ignore.

The service is grand, so you really can't go wrong with this restaurant if the occasion warrants the dent in your wallet."}
{"text":"Although this place is up there in price, I think it's totally worth it for a special occasion!
My husband took me here for our Anniversary, and it was a lovely experience. The food is impeccable, and the wine selection was fantastic! 

Would definitely come back! :)"}
{"text":"Nothing bad about this place, it's all great.. I'm not quite sure it's worth the money though.. Highly recommended if money is no issue, otherwise look elswhere."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with a small group and we decided to try 5 different steaks, shared by the table. We ordered steak from farms in ontario, alberta, US, australia and japan. Each of the steaks were exceedingly tasty, and prepared perfectly. It was great to try them all, and really take notice of the difference between the flavours. The waiter was very knowledgeable about each steak and the farms that they originated from.  The A5 wagyu from japan was undoubtedly the best, and compared very closely to A5 that I have had from different prefectures in Japan. It is very rich and if you've never tried it, it is definitely worth trying. I should say though that I would not want an entire A5 wagyu steak for myself, being as rich as it is (and with a $250+ pricetag) it was nice to share, and balance with leaner varieties. When I have tried it in Japan, it usually comes as a 1-2 oz piece and not as a traditional steak.

The sides and desserts were also very noteworthy. We even tried all of the housemade sorbets, which were all delightful."}
{"text":"Very good service. We got the Caesar salad, beef tartare, and sirloin steak. The Caesar salad is a must try and beef tartare was the best that I've eaten. Both were very generous portions for two. I would say the beef tartare could be shared by three people even. The 12 oz sirloin was a bit sinewy, so we think we will try the ribeye next time.

As part of our meal we got giant complimentary Yorkshire pudding, and a one-bite shortbread and brownie to end the meal. The brownie was excellent and we also got complementary muffins to take home. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Oh, cows, how tasty you are.  I rarely eat meat, but I made an exception because someone else was paying and I figured that Jacobs would know what it was doing.  And oh, does it ever!  This place is a classic steakhouse: the food's not particularly adventurous or avant garde (if you don't want steak, you can have chicken. Or maybe fish), but everything they do, they do very well, right down to the ritual dressing of your Caesar salad at the table.

The sides are predictable (lots of variants of potatoes), as are the desserts (creme brulee and chocolate cake), but they're tasty and go well with the steak--which truly does deserve to be the centre of the meal.  Well-aged, perfectly seared, tender beef: how delicious!

The place doesn't seem very busy, though, which detracts from the experience, and the upselling (get a salad! get some oysters! how about some wine?) made me cringe a bit, but it's otherwise a great place to go.  (To be fair, the salad, oysters, and wine were excellent.)"}
{"text":"This is the best steak house in the city.  The food is cooked aged and presented perfectly.  I would recommend the caesar it's made in front of you and adds to the experience.  This place also has a nice little piano bar in the lobby.  Go."}
{"text":"I went to a charity event at Jacob & Company and I'm dying to go back for another spectacular steak dinner.  The steaks themselves are as tasty as they get.  The chef spoke to us about how/where/why they procure their beef.  Needless to say, they spare no expense in finding the best source and they take pride in finding the best cuts.  I fell in love with the french fries cooked in duck fat.  Then again, I would eat an old shoe fried in duck fat.  The dining room itself is beautiful.  Imagine a very modern, sleek space with ample room between tables.  It's one of those rooms that need to be completely packed for it to come alive.  Otherwise, the minimalist decor would feel too sparse if it's not a full house.  The service was sufficient but did not blow me away.  I would go back with a large group or for a business dinner.

This is definitely NOT your dad's steakhouse."}
{"text":"Top notch steak house. Best Caesar salad in Toronto, made table side! The steaks were to die for. Grilled to perfection, medium rare just how I like em! Great cocktails and wine selection. Went here for our first anniversary and was not disappointed. Cannot say enough how good this place is. PRICEY but worth every dollar! 

tip: yes the prices are sky high but the portion are huge! Other their Caesar salad and best  to order a steak to share and get something else small on the side. We could not finished our steak we ordered."}
{"text":"Loved every minute of my 3 hour dinning experience. From the food, to the service and ambiance, this is a must visit. I've been to so many over hyped restaurant in the last year, but this place deserves every star & raving review. Every part of the meal was a hit (which is pretty rare). They even send you home with a wrapped up muffin. The staff take their time to explain the impressive (and slightly overwhelming) menu to help you select the cut of meat that's just right for you. I was very happy with my perfectly cooked (rare) tenderloin. The side of mushrooms & duck fat fries were really good too. And I was blown away by their true creme brûlée (the cheesecake is great too)."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday. I really loved the food and service. The location is convenient, the decor is clean, simple, and elegant. The food is delicious.

My wife and I shared a caesar salad, potato gratin, USDA Prime Black Angus 75 day aged striploin and a Snake River Farms Wagyu striploin. The caesar salad is prepared at our table, which is a nice little bonus. I liked the salad but did not think it was amazing and stands out. The same can be said about the potato gratin. The steaks are great and I feel that they do an amazing job with them. The angus was very flavourful and cooked very nicely. I find they get a nice sear on it, almost crispy crust, with a tender centre. The wagyu is a very rich steak. I can only say it is very juicy. I don't get steaks too often, but I am definitely a fan after these two steaks. I do think I am lucky my wife and I shared most of this meal (which Jacobs makes sharing very easy with their pre-sliced steaks). The wagyu is a very rich and heavy steak and eating even 12 oz is a lot given how much marbling there is. I'm sure many others may be able to easily finish 12 oz of it, but I would find it difficult. Getting a bit of the wagyu and angus was great as I could taste, compare, and enjoy without overloading on any one."}
{"text":"They gave me an amazing experience. 
I am sure it is the best steakhouse in Toronto.
Their Interior was also nice, especially I loved glass wine cellars and a glass meat refrigerator on the second floor. 

We ordered a steak which is mixed with wagyu and western beef. 
It was more marvellous taste that I had imagined. So sweet and I could feel it like melting while I masticated but not too fatty. 

I can not say there is reasonable price but I was able to satisfy more than I expected.
Food, Service, Atmosphere, everything what I can say just GREAT."}
{"text":"We came back here about 6 months later for dinner and had another great meal. One caveat was that the hostess walked us upstairs to a table we did not really want as it was a busy spot next to a huge table of people. We asked nicely if we could have another table and the hostess gave us a death stare. She walked us around the corner to a much better table and looked completely miserable. I would think that because we would be spending upwards of $300 here for dinner, it really wouldn't have been a big deal, especially since it was late on a Sunday night. It kind of ruined the initial mood of the meal, however our server and the meal was fantastic again. We ordered two steaks, the poutine, and a few appetizers. I would come back again, and perhaps request a table in the back before hand."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend about 2 weeks ago. Even though we were late for our reservation and came in about an hour before their closing they didn't turn us away. Our server was lovely and had an extensive wine knowledge that was greatly appreciated by us wine novices. She brought out 2 bottles of wine for us to try 1 new world and 1 old world. We ended up getting the new world bottle which she decanted for us. 

We started with the oyster rockefeller which I wasn't a fan of.. it tasted like ground beef pizza and it was cold. I don't recommend this dish at all.

Our mains were the 10oz A5 black tajima from Kagoshima, the bone in snake farm wagyu striploin, and for our sides we had the asparagus and the duckfat fries

First off I love that the plates they bring out are piping hot. I don't understand why other places don't do this. When the plate is cold it sucks out the heat from the steak taking away from the whole experience. 

The A5 black tajima was unlike anything i've ever experience before it was so full of flavour and just melted in your mouth like butter. It was cooked to perfection with the slightest crisp on the outside 

The wagyu was the star of the night.. amazing burst of flavour with every bite and the texture was perfect. The absolute best steak i've ever had. I've also had the $1000 kobe steak at harbour which was not as good as this. Reasonable price point as well.

we finished off with the 12 layer chocolate cake that was delicious and the muffins with the bill were a great touch and super delicious as well.

The best dining experience i've had and I can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"A friend and I had dinner at this place. Great steak. However, it was too expensive ($99- 600 for a steak). The dining area was simplistic (I.e white walls). Given the static state of meat prices in Toronto, their price is more than double. Because of the pricing, an average person can only afford to eat here once a year. 

Good steak but not worth the price."}
{"text":"We ordered the caesar salad, two rib-eyes; one with a side of bone marrow and the other with foie gras, and the duck fat fries. 

Our steaks were cooked perfectly and were on point. Loved the foie gras and bone marrow. 

We were disappointed with the salad and the duck fat fries. For all the hoopla around the table-side salad preparation, the final product was average at best. 

The duck fat fries were soggy and inedible so we left them. 

The service was great."}
{"text":"I have gone to Jacobs a few times over the past couple of years and I always come out with the same content feeling after a fantastic steak meal.  

The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice and intimate, with the dining area on the 2nd floor.  The 1st floor is where you are greeted by the hostesses.  There is a bar area with a piano lounge while you wait.

It is NOT a cheap meal, but if you want good steak, it is well worth it.  Instead of Ruth's Chris, try Jacobs.  There are a wide variety of steaks, different each night.  The waiter was very attentive and willing to make recommendations depending on your mood.  I love the wagyu beef that they have.  The steaks are served with a selection of sauces and salts to enhance the flavours of the steak.

Certainly try the caesar salad that's made table side.  I can no longer eat caesar dressing that is not made fresh anymore.  Sides need to be ordered for the steak and I recommend duck fat french fries!

One of my favourite parts of the meals come at the very end when they deliver breakfast muffins for the next day.  I'm so happy when I'm munching on it with a cup of tea, reminiscing about my yummy steak the night before."}
{"text":"So I love steak and have gone to new York Chicago and Las Vegas and yammed proper steak. Wolfgang in nyc by far hands down...this place falls short. The atmosphere is nice and probably had the best Ceasars salad ever...but still not worth 28 dollars...which is pretty much the theme for this rest. Good food but not worth the money.  Steak was flavourful and cooked well but at 75 u would think it would be amaizing...the place is pricier than Wolfgangs and not anywhere close in flavor.  Steak comes a la carte...sides were decent but again not too hard to get those right ..honestly I would rather go to barbarians if I was in dt and looking for a beef fix.  Glad I came once but wouldn't frequent."}
{"text":"Best food and service in town.  Perfect for special occasions and celebrations.  You will definitely not regret choosing to come here."}
{"text":"The  BEST dining experience EVER!  I wish I could give it 7 stars because everything was better than any dining experience. I live in Michigan but have travelled and ate and many very fine steak houses and 5 star restaurants throughout the United States and Canada and this is officially my favorite! It was my son's 13 th birthday while we were on vacation in Toronto. We told the concierge at the Four  Seasons that we were looking for a great steak (my son loves steak) and she suggested Jacobs and Co. Our waitress was excellent and helped us choose which entree she thought we would each like best - which really turned out to be absolutely perfect. It addition to the best steak ever, the  popovers and side dishes (and the bag of house made muffins we received to take home for breakfast) were all so delicious. They brought a special dessert for my son for his birthday. The manager of the restaurant had noticed that I had a difficult time walking up the steps when I came to the restaurant. He had mentioned to our waitress that he would escort us out an easier way when we were finished. To our delight, he took us on a detailed and lovely tour of his restaurant that was so spectacular and we will never forget. He then walked us outside and went out of his way to find us a cab. He was really such a sweet man, so proud of his restaurant which I think he  should be and was a total delight. Our immediate feeling is that it would be worth the four hour drive to go back to relive his evening and drive home. While a number of restaurants have their 5 star ratings, I have yet to find one that I  find as a good. Don't miss the very special opportunity of greatest- if you haven't been there, you need to experience it for yourself... Many, many, many thanks to their amazing and attentive team!"}
{"text":"Guys, if you are looking for a decent place...don't come here!! This is a top high-end restaurant with delicious steak and excellent service. I had the ribeye, medium cooked, with corn and potato. What can I say...best steak in TO. I totally recommend this place, definitely a five stars. Cheers."}
{"text":"Best steak in the city hands down! As a steak lover, i can assure you that there is no better place to get a steak in Toronto! It's a little on the pricey side, so it might not be the best choice to go here if you are on a tight budget. If you can afford it, stop what you're doing, pick of the phone, and make a reservation here asap. Your stomach won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The best steakhouse in Toronto, hands down.  (I've been to all the \"best\" ones in TO)


Beautiful restaurant, excellent, knowledgeable service and THE tastiest, most delectable ribeye steak I have EVER had. mmmmmmm *drool*

Recently I went back and had the filet mignon done blue rare.  It was like cutting into butter.  So tender and delicious.  

With all the fabulous restaurants in Toronto, I often find it hard to return to the same ones.. cause there is always something new to try.  Jacob's however, I can't help but go back every so often cause it's just so damn good."}
{"text":"Mother of Divine and Holy Jospehine! Trust me, the steak is just a distraction for the dessert!

So we came here for dinner, knowing it would be expensive but also extremely tasty. Now, let me warn you, these people are mad into their customer service and you can tell their wait staff is trained within an inch of its life. After we ordered I disappeared off to the loo and when I came back thought to myself, \"Hey, I remembered to fold my napkin all neat and tidy! Talk about well raised. Go me!\" No, Jane, you did not. The nice blonde lady folded your napkin while you were gone. She also folded it when you left in on your chair and scooted around to the other side of the table like a completely commoner. She was omnipresent with the water jug, too.

If you're like me, table manners are something you play by ear with a healthy dose of common sense. This place had a really nice feeling of, \"Oh my, so FAAANCY!\" without making me feel like I *shouldn't* be there, scooting around the table, asking questions about the food, or using the wrong fork (it's endearing in person, trust me). The staff were friendly, overly attentive without being overbearing (it was a real achievement) and they never swiped our plates before we were finished and never rushed while we hummd and hawed over the wine and dessert menus.

As every reviewer has said before me, the steak was great (pro tip: the medium rare is a little more medium than rare in my opinion, just in case you're super hormonal about your steak). We also had the duck fried french fries and the potato gratin. I should have just got two orders of potato gratin. It comprises my two favourite things (cheese and potatoes) and let me tell you, Jacob knows his gratin -- it was incredible.

DESSERT!

I am a sweets, dessert, cake, pie, CANDY woman at heart. Before we left I had a little Cherry Blasters appetizer. A whole bag's worth, you guys (regretsy.com, for sure). Sweets are my comfort. They're my go to. I need them. I was definitely getting dessert. I opted for the apple crumble because I was insanely full and I knew in my heart of hearts that I should not be getting anything. I figured it would be a safe, average-sized serving of apple crumble with a little scoop of icecream on the side. Maybe a drizzle of caramel sauce if they were really trying to knock my socks off. 

Sweet bloody JESUS, this dessert was a meal in and of itself. My boyfriend got the creme brulee and it was the biggest I've ever since. The crumble was toasted oats and cereal type stuff. It was poured on top of a soup bowl-full of piping hot baked apples. Topping it all off was a massive scoop of ice cream sitting in a well of caramel ... fudge? ... sauce. 

They had to roll me out of the place. Worse? They handed me chocolates, and breakfast muffins going out the door! Finishing things off for a nice 'I ate too much and now I want to puke' evening: I had to cycle home all the way down effing Spadina.

Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Service is excellent. Brought my boyfriend here for his birthday, we had 2 different type of steak, ceaser salad and a complimentary cake. Everything taste great! One of the best steakhouse"}
{"text":"Jacob's is one of my favourite Steakhouses in Toronto and it's not just due to the food. Not only is the food phenomenal, but the service and ambiance goes to match. I always enjoy bringing clients here, and I can always be confident that the experience will be positive as well as impressive."}
{"text":"Loved my experience here. I would go back. Service was top notch.
They start you off with fresh baked bread popovers or muffins whatever you call them. Delicious. The rest of the food is just as good. My meat was cooked to perfection. We ordered a bunch of sides since it was family style. All were very good. Not very great for people sensitive to dairy because they were mostly cream based. I ended with the smores cheesecake. It's def very very good. I tried the monkey bread and that was stellar too. I heard the creme brulee was just ok. But the main thing that has me going, hell yeah, I will be back, is their breakfast muffins. Along with our bill came breakfast muffins. They weren't much to look at at the time. But the next morning, it was the most amazing muffin ever. I will be going back.
My only other comment, nothing to do with food, would be, the washrooms. Given how amazing the whole experience was, the wasrooms didn't seem to fit. They were narrow and lacking in space."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in Toronto. Not cheap but for that special occasion it's worth the extra $$$$. The caesar salad is a great supporting cast!"}
{"text":"The rolls at the beginning are delicious and they give you muffins to take home for breakfast. I've had better fillet but it was very good."}
{"text":"This place is highly recommended and I would say confident it was the best steakhouse experience myself and partner have had."}
{"text":"I've dined at Jacobs & Co. before and had a great time.  The food was very good and the service pretty fine tuned.  We were a party of 8 celebrating a friends big birthday.  We brought our own cake.  The server advised us that there was a $25 plating fee.  We were surprised as we were not notified of this fee beforehand but thought, fine, we have the cake so we might as well.  She departs and returns within seconds and revises the fee to $5/person = $40 plating fee.  My friend asked why the fee, I quickly replied it is because we are not buying dessert from the restaurant and the server immediately confirms my statement.  So, for all you who want to bring in a cake for a special occasion, think again.  We spent an average of $150per person and they charged us a plating fee!  Wow!  Nickel and diming clients at such a high end establishment.  I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone ever again, nor will I be returning.  I would rather spend thousands on a ticket to Japan and have my wagyu there.  You got your $40 plating fee, but you will not get another nickel from me again!"}
{"text":"My BF is a big steak lover so i decided to take him to this restaurant on his birthday. This is located right on Brant Street.

Parking was a drag since it was so cold out and i was wearing a dress my BF decided to drop me off at the door and park somewhere then walk over. Theres a huge deadly staircase you have to walk down at the front door with a sign \"please watch your step\".

I sat at the front next to the hostess/maitre'd and when my date came in he checked our coats and walked us upstairs to our table.

Along the way you will see a nice baby grand piano with a pianist playing soothing music and candles that softens the atmosphere.

I ordered a bottle of Red immediately with the intentions of getting steaks obviously. the prices range from 40-1000+ and its thick like an encyclopedia so im sure you can find something you like in there.

We got the lobster cobb salad to start, i ended up getting chicken due to the size of the steaks that was offered and my date got the steak and lobster tail.

The steak was served with blue cheese, soy sauce and a gree sauce and 3 other spices. 

The food was delicious. Nothing i would change maybe ordering less food so i didnt feel uncomfortably full."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant for steak.  The flavor of the beef comes through and all you need is a little bit of salt that they provide.  It is so good that it is now my benchmark when comparing to steak at other places (e.g. Keg - in Alberta!).  After bringing a friend here (originally from outside of Canada), I have told him that he wouldn't want to try steak at other GTA restaurants from now on.  And after I had steak last night at Spencer's (Burlington restaurant, yelp reviews were good re: steak), I can conclude that Jacobs is still the best.
Plus their cheese popovers are so good!"}
{"text":"Jacobs & Co Steakhouse is just EXTRAORDINARY.  The food is amazing, the service is great, the restaurant is beautiful.  I love everything about it.  It is very expensive but is worth it every penny. I wish restaurants like TOCA from the Ritz can learn from Jacobs.  FIVE stars, definitely FIVE stars."}
{"text":"It truly is the best steakhouse in town! Good ambience, great service, awesome food!

Caesar's salad - It really is as good as everyone says!
Duck fat french fries - Not a wow but very good as well!
Black Angus ribeye and A5: Best steak I've ever had! The Japanese A5 really melts in your mouth :)

5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary.  The atmosphere was perfect for the occasion.  The service we received from Henry was very professional and personable.  Since we saw so many great items on the menu, we wanted to order much more but Henry, our server, saved us from ourselves.  As it was, we had steak tartar and a ceasar salad as our apps.  The steak tartar was great, especially considering how rare it is for me to find.  The ceasar dressing was made in front of us.  It was delicious, especially recommend you ask for everything in it.  We had porterhouse 40 ounce steak to share with fries.  Not sure I can say much about the fries, as fies are fries but the steak was incredible.  Also it was great that the restaurant accomodated the fact that my boyfriend likes his steak medium rare whereas I like very rare, and had it prepared right between both our preferences.  Although we never thought to ask about the cuts on display near the front enterance, it was still an interesting sight."}
{"text":"Jacobs & Co. is simply fantastic. Their selection of dry aged steaks from all around the world is remarkable. I went with two buddies and we ordered 3 different steaks and had them cut so we can share. All 3 had different yet exquisite taste. I'm very picky when it comes to steak and usually don't enjoy ordering one outside of my house, but Jacobs and Co. does it right!

Service is amazing, the rest of the menu was great too. Duck Fat Fries, made at your table Caesar salad, all great. It's quite expensive, but when looking to indulge and spend some money, you can't go wrong with Jacob and Co."}
{"text":"Service A++++++ !!! Honestly treated like royalty eating here. They make sure your table is constantly clean. 

Food A+++. Food is amazing, best chicken I've ever had, boyfriend said the steak is the best he's ever had, better than the keg. They have their own meat storage room and age it themselves. They serve cheese popovers with oregano and roasted garlic butter. Honestly so fresh! At the end they give you take home muffins.

I went for my birthday as a surprise from my boyfriend and they are very classy.

Definitely fancy and upscale. Steaks range from $38 from Ontario 6 oz, to  $1000 for a 50 oz Japan imported steak."}
{"text":"This was the best dining experience I have ever had. I have never had more attentive service, more knowledgable servers and better tasting food. I think my favourite part revolved around the small extra touches. For example, the bread was extraodinary (I would have paid for it as an appetizer), them asking if it was a special occasion, discovering we were celebrating a birthday and subtly bringing a complimentary desert, and the delicious freshly baked muffins they sent us home with for breakfast the next day. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I chose this place because I heard it was the best steak place to go in Toronto, I decided to take a dear friend of mine for his birthday celebration, I have experienced many places, for steak including places in New York and Chicago. I don't really know where to start but, first thing I will say is I am a foodie, with a great palette, I have experienced lost of places. And also enaged in the social media such as Instagram. So that being said I feel like I know good food. I started my dinner if with a ceviche, that was decent. The presentation was beautiful, then we ordered the Caesar salad, the waitress came to the table was preparing for our Caesar salad which I was looking forward to, it was interesting how it was prepared in front of us, that was cool, despite the annoying scraping noise as she stiredand scraped a wooden bowl to mix the invredience for st least 4 min, thank god that was over. So we ordered a T-bone steak, was not flavourful at all, and the bake potato, tasteless and the not much flavour to it st all. I ordered asparagus too to go with the dinner, it was blanch then Sateed, not really that impressed I have to say, especially a dinner for 2, for $300. I feel it overrated, and there are way better steak places I. The city than Jacobs, being a good, I would not recommend this place, save your money and go anywhere else. I am glad I went  to experience the place for the first time, and now I know better. Cheers Happy dining, 
Btw, Mortons Rocks !!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant ever and ever and ever!!! Everything is amazing I can't tell you how perfect everything is. I went there on my fiance's birthday, they were very kind and the steak was amazing. After that incredible stuff and food we went there several times and had a great experience on each visit. They worth every cent!!! Love you JACOBS."}
{"text":"Amazing from start to finish. We were greeted warmly and lead to our table by a lovely man who must have been the manager. As we walked to our table he pointed out all the different features of the restaurant. The decor was beautiful and the ambiance was so welcoming. We had heard so much about the table side caesar salad and it did not disappoint. The salad dressing was made from scratch right in front of us and it was very tasty. My boyfriend and I opted to go for the half order of mushrooms and the potato puree as well as a 25oz T-Bone USDA steak which we shared. Everything was amazing and we were so full by the end of it. Overall it was a wonderful experience which everyone should try at least once."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best steak I've ever had. I can't wait to come back here. I would recommend going with people who like their steak cooked the same way as you since the steaks are quite large, so it would be ideal to get a couple and share.  I ended up having to eat a 12 oz ribeye myself, in addition to the Caesar salad (shared but still a large portion!) and some side orders (mashed potatoes and duck fat fries).  My fiancé had an 18oz strip loin. The steaks were so flavourful and smooth as butter! The various salts and dipping sauces were also really delicious although the steak had such good flavor with just some sea salt that you don't really need those extras.  The mashed potatoes were delicious, but I could have lived without the fries which were a little on the soggy side for my liking.  The service is good here, the staff know just when to approach the table and when to let you enjoy your meal. The take home muffins were great as was the little brownie bite at the end, although I was way too stuffed to really enjoy it... 
Given the size of the portions here, I really don't think the prices are astronomical when compared to other expensive steakhouses downtown (Barberian's, Ruth's Chris, Mortons) and really the steaks are far better at Jacobs than the other places I've tried!"}
{"text":"Jacobs runs a tight ship.  I can't get enough of that meat cellar!!  The staff took the time to explain the aging process, and brought out a sample platter of different cuts of meats, each aged a different number of days.  Definitely helped us make an informed decision about what we were about to order.  

The Caesar salad is made fresh table-side, and oh-so-good.  Also try the beef tartare...best way to start off your dinner!  All the cuts that my party ordered were prepared exactly the way we wanted.  I love how you can ask for your meat to be cooked rare plus (or medium rare minus lol).

The muffins after dessert are also a very nice touch...save for breakfast if you can!"}
{"text":"Jacobs was undoubtedly one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. I went there for a team dinner (8 guys). Upon arrival, the exterior of the building seems pretty humble...until you notice the cars in the parking lot. Our party was seated downstairs by the bar (they converted the lounge set up into a dining set up that evening, I suppose).

Two things that made this very fun: 1) we decided to eat family style, and 2) we weren't paying for the meal. Put these together and it means everyone gets to try a lot of different food. 

Since we were family styling it, we got a 40oz porterhouse, 25oz T Bone, 14oz ribeye, and 10oz wagyu, all cooked to medium rare. As we heard good things about their Caesar salad, everyone got that. For side dishes, we got orders of the duck fat fries, stuffed baked potato, potato gratin, green beans, rapini, and asparagus (pretending to be healthy with those last 3). Finished it off with creme brule for dessert, even though we were beyond stuffed by that point.

EVERYTHING tasted so good. Watching the caesar salad being made beside our table was pretty cool. For the steaks, they give a wide range of seasoning and sauces, but I didn't really feel the need to use the. Side dishes were awesome (duck fat fries!). throughout the course of the meal, we had A LOT of wine. Since we wouldn't really be doing pairings, we just asked the waitress for some good recommendations and she brought the next one over as we finished the previous bottle. All her recommendations were great.

Speaking of the waitress, this was one of the few times that service has actually exceeded by expectations. You already expect service to be good at a place like this, but our waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. This really came out when we asked for the wine reco's (the wine menu had over a hundred items) - she seemed to know the nuances of each wine she recommended herself, as well as any that we pointed out. She stopped by frequently enough that we never felt neglected, but not so much that she annoying. Just 1st class service.

Awesome experience and hope I get a chance to go back."}
{"text":"Great steak! Great food. Wonderful all round. 
We originally came to Jacobs from a friends recommendation and we got hooked. I was never a steak person but now I crave their steak at least once in 2-3 months. When our friends ask us for a great steakhouse in Toronto we tell them to come here. There is no gimmick or extra flavoring needed. They cook their meat to perfection and let you enjoy it just as it is without all those sauces and sweet stuff other places slather on to distract you."}
{"text":"Marvelous food, impeccable service, warm ambiance.  

I was late to this dinner party and was greeted at the door by a very polite gentleman. Upon giving our hosts name, I was escorted to our table. 

My wife and I ordered two different steaks so that we could try different cuts.  She had the Candian Prime Hereford tenderloin and I had USDA Black Angus bone in striploin, aged 60 days, Chicago style.  Both cuts were amazing but my wife and I preferred the American cut.  in addition to our steaks, we ordered rappini,  snow pea leaves, a baked potato, and the beautiful fries cooked in duck fat.  This last item was delicious.  Can French fries have subtle, flavourful layers! Yes they can!  Mmmmmm

Prior to our steaks, we had a seafood tower consisting of mussels, oysters, lobster, jumbo shrimp, scallop salad, and crab salad. A meal unto itself! 

After the seafood tower we were served Ceasars salad made from scratch, in front of us. Beautiful homemade Ceasars salad with all the fixings! Anchovies, tobasco, copious amounts of Parmesan, homemade croutons. Wow.


We were also served their cheese puff bread, but I didn't try it so cannot attest personally as to how it tasted but judging by everyone else's reaction, our companions loved it.  

We had our own waiter, Greg, who had various assistants but he was always in attendance. He was courteous, and knowledgeable with all facets of our meal, including the wine. One of our dinner mates chose our 4 different red wines, and our dessert wine, a beautiful sauterne. The only red wine I remember was from the Noir Valley. Possible the smoothest red wine I've ever indulged in.

Dessert consisted of Monkey bread. Sinfully rich.  

They gave us all breakfast muffins as well but I haven't tried it yet, but what a cool idea!

Overall we had a fantastic night. There was nothing about this meal/restaurant that I didn't like!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Jacob! When I first went last year I would have rated it  a 5/5. However, this time the quality wasn't the same. The popovers were a bit too over, they had a burnt taste to them on the outside. The tartar didn't have that umami flavour and the steaks were mediocre.
However, the only redeeming quality this time around was the service. Always attentive and knowledgeable. Even the muffins at the end were much smaller. 
Not cool Jacob not cool at all!!!"}
{"text":"Came here a few days before Christmas with the hubs. We were both craving a quality steak and decided to try this place out. Our expectations were somewhat high considering the reviews and price level of this place. We were NOT totally wowed.

We started off with complementary pop overs, they were nice but somewhat overcooked, the hubs liked it.

For our mains we got a 40oz porterhouse from Guelph (aged 45 days) topped with foie  gras (our server recommended this porterhouse), duck fat fries and chilli sauteed rapini.

The porterhouse came with 3 sauces (ponzu, chimichurri, brie) and 3 salts (charcoal, oak and sea salt) on the side. We got our porterhouse medium rare. The steak was nicely cooked. It has a nice crunchy crust, but we found that it was not quite as tender or as flavorful as we had hoped. We have been to several great steakhouses around the world, our bar for this restaurant given the price level was around Keen's steakhouse level in NYC, and it falls quite a bit short of that (a Keen's porterhouse is also cheaper, if only I lived in NYC still). The salts were nice, I quite enjoy sprinkling the oak-salt onto my steak since it was a bit under-salted for our taste.

The fois gras that came with the steak was wonderful! Props for that, it complemented the steak well, since our cut was somewhat lean.

The duck fat fries was something I was looking forward to and it was pretty disappointing, I really did not get the rich duck flavor from them, and they were kind of limp. Hubs was not impressed with this either.

The rapini is great - nicely cooked and the chilies added a nice kick.

The meal ended with complementary chocolates and muffins to take home, the muffins were super moist and has a nice crunchy sugar crust, love them (5 stars for the muffins) and the chocolates were nice.

The service was nice, polite and attentive from the greeters to coat checkers to the server. The ambiance is posh and it is not too loud, there was live piano playing on the first floor.

Overall, good service and ambiance, but given the price (and hype) we expected higher quality steaks. The steak is by no means bad, it was a pretty good steak, but not outstanding or exceptional. It is probably the best steakhouse that we have been to in Toronto, but it would not even make our top 10 list of best steak houses we have visited."}
{"text":"My all time favorite steakhouse! Discovered this a few years ago and ever since i have been addicted to their rib eye steak. We get the 56 day aged 18 oz canadian angus rib eye with potato gratin and house made ceasar salad usually. Its a little on the pricey side but not so bad. Best steakhouse in toronto!

Service is impeccible and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure they have one of, if not the best steak tartare in the city. The portion is generous, and the preparation is perfect. A lot of places seem to over season so you can't really taste the steak anymore."}
{"text":"we were group of four. two couples.
service was amazing. super professional, knowledgeable and right on top of everything.
we started with the sea food tower and shared it 4 ways. it was beautifully presented however i felt the shrimp and lobster were over cooked and were very much on the dry side (not to say rubbery). the mussels & oysters were amazing!
the steak was good, properly cooked however i didnt taste the extra meaty taste of aging and all the rest of the spill they spoke about.

bottom line it was way over pricey to pay $350 per couple and you would be hard press to pay less.... wine menu you need a magnifying glass and lots of time/patience to find a bottle of wine at less then $100. many are in the 4 digits category....Cesar salad at $20 etc etc it keeps on going...

there are way better value steakhouse in town with equal quality and service. it was pretentious over the top and the food unfortunately wasnt there to match the price.

This was an attempt on making a vegas style steakhouse however even at vegas steakhouses I had been to couple of micheal mina steakhouses and they are much better value

- side comment for ownership, there was a beautiful vibe on entrance level with a gentleman playing a piano however on the floor level that lacked very much  and would have been lovely to have some background music"}
{"text":"Knowledgeable staff, huge selection of wines, perfectly cooked cuts of meat that make you hate yourself for tainting them with an assortment of amazing homemade steak sauces. Get the Caesar salad made table side. Portions are HUGE. Service is over the top. 

Total $150-175 per person"}
{"text":"We went there with a party of three. The service is outstanding. It was our first time at Jacobs and the server went in detail through the menue with us and was helpful with all the questions we had.

We started with the caesars salad (which I guess is a kind of \"MUST\" at the jacobs). As meat we had the SnakeRiver Tenderloin which is excellent. The sides were nothing special but matched the main course quite well (in fact, the onions were a little to dark). Creme Brulee was also nice, but I had better ones - the layer of caramel was from my point of view a bit to thick.

All in all an exceptional experience. The place is pricy but woth the money."}
{"text":"It's a friend's birthday and she wanted to go all out and try this steakhouse for dinner. This place was pretty busy on a Friday night, we didn't reservations until 8:30pm and we were there till around 11:30pm and there were still people there even when their posted hours is only till 11pm. The service was very good, very attentive and try to satisfy your every need, that's the price you are paying for. The ambience was indeed classy, up-scale atmosphere. I ordered a glass of red tempranillo wine from Spain (6oz - $18) to start.

The server brought us some cheese pop-overs with herb butter. It was still warm and spreading the herb butter which melt into the pop-over. It was delicious and since I was starving. Some of my friends order the Caesar salad. The waiter bring all the ingredients and make it at our table from scratch including the sauce. The salad was very small size considering it costed $18. I tried a little from my friend - verdict was - it wasn't an amazing salad, regular fresh toss salad. There was big pieces of bacon and lots of cheese. Definitely not worth it to me.

Finally, our steak arrived. I ordered the A5 Black Tajima-Okinawa - Striploin 4oz ($89) with foie gras ($16) cooked at medium rare. Even though it was only 4oz, it was good size for me. First the steak - it was very tender, it didn't melt in my mouth like people describe, I had to chew it but it was soft. It was fatty and very good flavours. I didn't have to add any of the salt or sauces that was provided. The foie gras was amazing as well, soft and melt in your mouth. It was great with the steak on top.  The steak was one of the better ones I have eaten so far. Now for is it worth the $89, well that depends on your own personal opinion and your feel on food. It is indeed expensive but to me as a foodie, it was a one time experience that I had and it was worth it for me. I don't know if I will try it again though ... not for awhile at least. One of my friend had the $150 steak, she thinks it was worth it. My other friend wasn't that impressed of the steak.

Since it was my friend's birthday, they came with plate of small desserts with birthday candle to the table...aww. We got our bill with the take home muffins. I was way too full so I haven't tried the muffins yet. The damage ... well, it did hit a dent in my wallet."}
{"text":"The food and service was exceptional. We had a party of 6 and shared a variety of cuts and sides. The Australian Wagyu simply melt in your mouth delicious."}
{"text":"I have died and gone to heaven.
Came here for NYE dinner with my boyfriend and everything from the moment we pulled up to the valet to the moment we left was absolute perfection.
Except for a few minor things that I'll only include in case someone from the restaurant is reading this and can make 100% perfect. 
1.  think you should be able to walk to your table with your coats instead of doing coat check at the door - you're left lingering in the reception area too long and it's quite cold without a coat
2. Related: I think someone should bring your coats to your table when you're done paying and ready to leave, and they should also show you out, especially if you were sat upstairs it's a bit of a maze to get out. Maybe I was just so drunk off the amazing steak I was disoriented.
3. The washroom upstairs is single stall and was pretty gross. Not sure if all the washrooms are like this or if this one just wasn't the main one.
4. One of our popovers was burnt :( so disappointing because the non-burnt one was incredible but the burnt one tasted like crap.
Everything else was wonderful and so decadent though. We got the potato puree, 8oz Hokkaido strip, 14oz USDA black angus corn fed ribeye, chocolate brownie, Jacob's Caesar and February Freeze for 2 people and it was slightly too much food (took home the rest of the potatoes). Everything was so luxuriously buttery. 
Valet service is great as well! It was raining when we pulled up and the valet ensured not a single drop got on me. When we got into our car afterwards the car and seats were warmed up nicely. Totally worth the $20+tip on a cold winter day.
Will definitely be coming back here, but no more than once per year as I need time in between to bask in the glow."}
{"text":"This is simply the best steakhouse in Toronto. It's not even close. Phillip at the front is my second father. A5 waygu is my child.  I bleed Amarone and my sweat is infused with volcanic salt. When I die, put a muffin in my coffin and toss me out on Brant street."}
{"text":"Awesome steakhouse. Very knowledge staff. They will walk you through the entire menu and describe how the region and the feed will effect the taste of your steak. The pop over buns are incredible - kind of like a buttery garlic Yorkshire pudding. I get my steak chared-blue and they always cook it to perfection. I am also a fan of getting the 2 oz fois gras steak topping. Favorite side is the duck fat fried potatoes (fries). Piano lounge is more lively, but upstairs is perfect for a more formal dinner or business meal. Lots of place close by for pre and post drinks. Love it here."}
{"text":"I thought ByMark was the benchmark for a great steak in the city until I tried Jacobs and Co. Let's just say it's a new benchmark. From the moment my friends and husband arrived, the impeccable service began. The wait staff were discreetly polite and so educational about the menu offerings. We did not have the most expensive steak on the menu but the Australian Waygu steak is delectable. We tried 2 other steaks (one from Canada and one from the US) as recommended by our waiter. Sharing steaks is clearly a strange concept in traditional steak houses but I highly recommend sharing so that you can taste a little of everything."}
{"text":"I don't even like steak, but I LOVED the steak at Jacob's. I'm that girl who will order a fish dish at a steakhouse. Yup, that's me. Jacob's is a different story. My bf and I had shared the porterhouse and it was oh-so-amazing. 

But the real winner was the caesar salad. I would come here just to have the salad. mmmm"}
{"text":"Had to make a yelp account just to be able to write the reviews that great restaurants deserve. This restaurant is phenomenal and a regular dinner place that my co workers and I have been visiting frequently for many years. I bring my wife here as well for special occasions and she is always satisfied."}
{"text":"Food - Almost 5 stars!  Had better food at Jacobs before. The complimentary bread to start off with was awesome like usual. The taste and texture was just baked right, could have a dozen if we didn't have to eat anything else. Thumbs up!

The steak was a bit burnt this time compared to the other times. However, the steak maintained it's richness in taste and texture - perfectly done on the inside, just not the outside. The quality of the steak was evenly marbled even on the type of steak were marbling was less expected.  

The Caesar salad which was one of the most amazing items I go to Jacobs for was a bit bitter this time. 

The dessert was amazingly good as expected. 
It didn't taste like it was made from few days ago. The dessert menu items had some of the regular classic items, and also others that you don't usually see on other menus, which I appreciate. It gets boring when the items are the same everywhere. Jacobs offered varieties. The classics and non classics. Thumbs up!

Environment - Clean and decent, just right. It isn't noisy like some steakhouse and isn't as quiet as some others. The noisier ones, you can't really have a proper conversation. The quieter ones, you would feel awkward to have a proper conversation. Jacob's was just right and comfortable. The eating area, floors and washrooms were cleaned to appropriate standards.

Service - Fantastic. The waiters were knowledgeable. They knew what went wrong with the food as if they were the chef and acknowledges it. They are extremely professional in manner and approaches to make things better. And if things were already right, they are happy together with you. They make the customer feel comfortable and connected rather than just a number. 

Overall Experience - Highly recommended. Been to many steakhouses in the province and country. This is one of the best for sure!"}
{"text":"Went for a friends bday and ate one of the best steaks I've ever had.  I started with the beef tarter (huge portion), which was flavoured perfectly. For my main I had a 12oz striploin sourced from P.E.I., which is then aged for another 35 days, the steak was cooked perfectly to order and had a perfect crust, the entire group also shared asparagus, duck fat fries and mushroom, all of which were equally delicious as our steaks.

The staff were extremely professional and our server was very attentive and knowledgeable.

I wouldn't hesitate to go back here."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in Toronto by far, and home of the best caesar salad I've ever had."}
{"text":"I recently went to Jacobs with my son for his birthday. It is his favourite steak house in Toronto. The Caesar salad made at the table is fantastic. Our server was helpful in giving us tips how to make it at home which we appreciated! I would compare it to my other favourite STK in New York city! Well worth the visit for sure."}
{"text":"Now that is how you cook a steak. Very elegant and modern take on an upscale steak house. Must try is the table side prepared casear salad. Great service."}
{"text":"It's a little hard to review this place because it's so damn expensive...  actually they have some dry-aged local steaks that aren't that expensive.  But I'm not sure if anyone actually order them, I could be wrong.

Little basic info, all steaks have to be aged.  Either wet or dry aged.  The steak you get at your local supermarket are most likely wet aged which basically means when the cow is slaughtered, the meat is packed in vacuum packing and the time between packing and cooking is the wet aging time.  Dry aging basically takes that further in a dry and controlled environment and the time is usually a lot longer.

So what's the difference?  I find the steaks at Jacob's to be more tender than the counterpart of the same cut.  Also I think it's more tasteful too but that's subjective because dry-aged steaks have that (cheese)(preserved) feel to the taste, can't find an adjective for that.  Wet aged steaks well taste more meaty, more fresh meat feel.  If you understand what I'm trying to describe, good for you.

It's definitely a very high end restaurant so only come here for special occasions.  We didn't get the most expensive A5 Kobe Beef, my wife and I got the Wagyu from USA and Australia.  Both were delicious, not so much anymore with the $600 bill at the end lol.  Oh ya I forgot to mention the fancy Caesar salad that they make in front of you, there is definitely a position in the restaurant which the job is only to make Caesar salads.

They really cook to perfection in terms of doneness whereas at The Keg, it's a hit or miss.  Not a fair comparison but it's a good reference.

Ok in summary, if you can afford it, give it a try and you'll discover another world of steak other than The Keg, you truly do taste the difference,  but of course not $500 difference.

I would definitely go again,  it's something you gotta save up for. Lol"}
{"text":"I've heard many many good reviews about this place, but they still surprised me with their high quality food. Mussels were fresh and perfectly steamed. Their beet salad was a surprise since I never like beets, but they made it so well. And of course the steak, you can really feel the difference. Very juicy and you can pair it with all different kinds of sauces. And finally the dessert, we got the cheese cake. Again no disappointment only surprise!"}
{"text":"You do not get what u pay for ..I sent my lobster back as well as people from the other table...very over rated..the reviews are totally off which makes me think the businesses put up there own reviews. Try it out see if I'm right..write me back if I'm wrong..."}
{"text":"Best steak selection in the city. Great spot to bring work meetings or dates where you want to impress, I was impressed with the wine selection and they cooked my steak to absolute perfection. Service was great even though there were a lot of people in the restaurant at the time. The Keg Mansion is my go-to in terms of price, but Jacob and Co. is my spot for a more upscale celebration. The only downside would be that the sides were a little... lackluster. They are definitely edible, but with the price tag you want something more fulfilling. You won't be disappointed with your steak though; and the atmosphere is beautiful."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. I love it. The steak was fabulous and the seafood tower was impressive. Try it if you are a big fan for seafood and steak."}
{"text":"Definitely on the pricer side but well worth it. My favorite on the menu is most certainly the Wagyu steak - extremely rich, you will not be able to eat a lot of it. The side sauces that come with your steak are nice added touch. For a side I enjoyed the rapini and the mashed potatos are good. 

Servers are extremely knowledgeable and helpful. A great place for those special occasions or night date."}
{"text":"My favourite steak restaurant in GTA.  Believe the hype about the steaks at Jacob's, because it is simply amazing.  The bf usually brings me here on special occasions and it has become the go-to for all special occasoins because after I tried Jacob's for the first time, I refused to go to any other steak place for celebrations.

For starter, I usually get the caesar salad.  The waiter will bring the salad station beside your table and make it for you on the spot, so you can customize it.  You will also be served very delicious bread, which is pretty much the best bread I have had at any fine dining establishment.  

For the main course, I usually like to get the ribeye, because there's some fatty bits in it which  makes it chewy and savoury.  The steak itself is very high quality and you can almost taste that intangible aspect to it.  The steaks are always served with an assortment of dipping sauces and salts, so you can add some further flavouring to your steak as you wish.  My partiular favourite is the blue cheese dip.  As for the sides, we have tried the asparagus, the sauteed mushrooms, the duck poutine fries - nothing bad to say about any of these sides.  I would however recommend the duck poutine fries and the caesar the most as accompaniments to your steak.

For drinks, I have tried the reds here as well as some of the cocktails - good, not much else to say about them, as my main obsession is the steak.

If you are sharing with another person, you can also try the bone-in-ribeye, which is a massive 25 oz steak, big enough for 2 people and with possibility of leftovers too.  You can also opt to only order a 'half side', so you can try more sides with your steak.  A very nice finishing touch at the end is a small dessert dish and they give you a bag of  their in-house baked chocolate chip muffins to take home for breakfast the next morning."}
{"text":"Bottom Line, steaks and service were a cut above ( no pun intended) BUT, the wine prices were way over blown, at least 3 -4 times over retail.  This is taking advantage of the customer.  So do some homework and know what wines cost, even if money is no object.  Shame on you Jacobs and Co."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times the service and food were PERFECT. Hands down the best steakhouse in Toronto. Would recommend the Caesar salad and poutine as sides to share."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and saw $1000+ steak...which they were sold out of!!!  I can't even imagine what that steak tastes like but it must come wrapped in bills.  OK, I'm kidding.

Anyways, the place was packed...we had no reservation...dropped in the last  minute and did I mention it was right before Xmas.  The hostess did a walk around and found us a table at the upstairs bar.  They were the last seats in the house and the best seats in the house!

The place looks like a steakhouse and feels like a steakhouse...or what a modern one should be.  It's pretty slick.  We sat down and our bartender/waiter was awesome.  He helped us through some of the drinks and we ended up ordering 2 steaks, 1 from Alberta and 1 from the US, as well as beefsteak tomatoes and the potato gratin. 

The steaks came cut in strips (we made the request) and were cooked perfectly!  I do prefer the American beef over Alberta beef, sorry Canada, I hope this doesn't make me a terrible Canadian!  Both steaks were excellent though.  The tomatoes (feta and thyme) and potatoes were excellent as well.  After our meal we got a small tour of the see through steak fridge and some explanation of steaks are aged.  It's a pretty cool ending to a great meal.  

The service is excellent and food does match it.  It was one of the best overall experiences I had in 2013 which was filled with amazing experiences."}
{"text":"This is a very very pricey steakhouse to visit but boy oh boy do these guys know how to make good food.

Been there twice and on both occasions we were greeted by friendly staff who were extremely knowledgeable about menu items. Almost too knowledgeable to the point that they wont shutup bragging about their specialty food items lol.

But I digress. The decor is great (different atmosphere based on level you dine at; upper or lower), the food is amazing and the parting gifts upon settling your bill are a nice touch. They also offer you an exquisite tray of global spices and salts to go with your meal. Simply amazing.

Next time I feel like draining my bank account ill consider hitting up this location!"}
{"text":"We had a corporate event here. The room downstairs is awesome, with wine on one side and aging meat on the other. The service was spot on, everything was tended to, and they created a great selection of steaks, cut into small bite sized pieces of the entire table. Everything went off without a hitch! 

The sides weren't all that impressive, hence the 4 versus the 5. The owner is also very nice."}
{"text":"If you're looking for steak and don't care what it costs Jacobs is the Best in the city ...... And the seafood is good too

Don't forget to try their Caesar salad made from scratch!"}
{"text":"Amazing every time. I've been here a dozen times and they never disappoint. Bone in strip! Enough said."}
{"text":"This is by far the best steakhouse I've been to in Toronto. The price range is on par with Harbour Sixty but the quality of the steak is incomparable. 

When me and my boyfriend arrived at the restaurant, we thought it would be pretentious inside as there was a Ferrari and a GTR parked right outside. However, we were greeted by the pleasant owner himself and taken up to the second floor, past a little jazz bar area. David was out waiter and he is AMAZING. He gave us very realistic suggestions on what we an actually fit in our stomach and answered all questions thoroughly. He was very knowledgeable in the different cuts of steaks and explained the difference of all the varieties they offered. I didn't know what the \"Swinging Ribeye\" was and he explained it to me referencing the Flintstones! He was overall very personable and attentive to detail. When our food arrived, we were asked once how everything was and wasn't bothered till we finished our meal. We told him it was my birthday and he came over with complimentary champagne and made a special decoration on my dessert (amazing mango sorbet)! 

All the servers were helping out one another and when I asked where the washroom was, one of the waiters personally walked me to the restroom! 

The Caesar salad is made right in front of you and The flavor was intense... Awesome salad! They have a room in the back where they store aged beef and can hand select which ones you want. We ordered the swinging ribeye, it was 36oz and more than enough to share. I like my steak medium rare and the bf likes it rare, and we got the best of both with this ribeye as the meat near the bone was raw and more marbled. It was delicious! 

I just finished this amazing dinner so can't stop raving about it (sorry)! I will definitely come back here. It has easily surpassed Harbour Sixty, Ruth Chris or David Duncan House in my opinion. 

Ps- when you come back from the washroom, the napkin would be neatly folded for you. (ninja waiters)!"}
{"text":"I came here a week or so ago. The four of us ordered a number of apps to share and I tried the bone marrow and steak tartare from the apps we ordered. The steak tartare was really well seasoned and everyone enjoyed it. The bone marrow tasted more like the seasoned bread crumbs than anything else so we were a bit meh about that app. 

We ordered a wagyu steak and a PEI steak (grass-fed and potato-fed!), both medium rare. We all expected the wagyu to be our preferred steak, but it was actually the other way around. The PEI steak was just so delicious. Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked to the requested temp. It was absolutely my dream steak. The wagyu, unfortunately, was completely under. It was between blue and rare. 

I pointed it out to our server that it was under and he said, \"Oh yes, it's more of a rare or rare plus than a medium rare,\" and then he just walked away. There was no offer to re-fire it for us to get the requested temp. That's why I knocked off the star, otherwise this would have been a five star experience. 

If you can't cook a steak, in a steakhouse, to the requested temp, then you deserve to lose a star. I would have even been harsher if it weren't for the perfection of the PEI steak. Also, the wagyu is not the kind of steak you want below medium rare. There's just too much marbling. All that fat needs to be warmed up to melt into the meat. Otherwise you're left with cool globules of fat in your mouth while you're trying to eat the steak. No bueno. 

We ordered a few of the desserts to share and we all agreed the monkey bread is crazy good. Just save yourself the disappointment of trying another dessert and order a few plates of the monkey bread to share. More delicious than you can possibly imagine."}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday celebration.  The service was great and very professional.  The food was good and spot on.  However, personally I don't think it justifies the price.  I can appreciate the business but I think it is slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"This restaurant has basement seating but unless you have the private room it's where the bar is and the entire area is too brightly lite.  The service was good and the Canadian wine was fairly priced and good.  The Napa wines were priced FOUR times their value and that's ridiculous.  The popovers at the beginning are AMAZING but the meal went downhill after that.  The seafood towers were average and the table side Caesar salad which is usually one of my favorites was over oiled lip and lifeless.  The steaks were very expensive across the board and more importantly NOT GREAT and not rally even warm....

I would not recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great steak with great ambience."}
{"text":"Came here for a Christmas Work Party, we booked a private room and had a lovely table overlooking the fresh meats and wine cellar. We were given options for wine, starters, and steak. Also had oysters served and delicious hand made truffles. 
The steak is truly out of this world, I had a $340 steak from Japan. It was the best steak I have ever eaten in my entire life and melted in my life. It would make a vegetarian go back to eating meat! Lol. 
Service was great. Overall, a wonderful time and would be great for parties or a date night."}
{"text":"Just finished my meal at this restaurant and it was so good I decided to post this straight away... It was mine and my partners anniversary and we wanted to do something special. One of my clients recommended this restaurant as she said it was the best in the city..... she was so right..

We were greeted by a beautiful friendly lady when we arrived and the owner came over to greet us and take us to our table....

 Everyone who we came in contact with wished us a happy anniversary... when seated they pulled out our seats for us and gave us sparkling wine to toast with which I thought was a fantastic touch.. 

Our waiter Hulio(I hope I got that right)  a Mexican /Canadian waiter was unbelievable.. he was full of information and we wanted for nothing.. 

Alexia made our ceaser salad , which was prepared in front and she was so so nice and even let us take a pic of her mixing our salad..... she prob made a 100 salads that day.. but still had a hugh smile and was so professional. 

Our steaks were the nicest Ive ever had... I would basically marry one of these steaks and sleep with it every night it was so good... garlic fries and mushrooms... the cutest girl came out and explained all of our sauces and salts that came with our steaks.. She was brilliant and very informative...

 Cocktails were amazing especially the cosmo.. Pricey but worth every penny ... Then came desert   .. I could have died and gone to heaven.... This place is a must go .... if u have not been dont hesitate because your missing out... Thank you to all the amazing staff and the fab owner who took his time to talk to us and make our night so special... We will be back...."}
{"text":"I came here last October. Love their lobster soup. The service is good. Will take my parents here again this month ."}
{"text":"It seems like many of the Yelpers concur that Jacobs is the place to be.  From the moment they accommodated me by placing the roses I ordered at our table, to the time our evening ended, it was amazing.  Pure class!

 It's not your typical dark dungeon of a steakhouse.  Dimly lit but you could see who was around you.  First when we arrived, the provided us a with complimentary glasses of champagne to celebrate our anniversary.  The server gave us a moment and then explained the types of steaks that were on the menu.  

The bread was freshly made and would have ordered more if we wanted plenty of carbs.  It was so deelish.  The bread was shaped like a large muffin.  It was light and melted it your mouth.  

Then came the ever popular Caesar Salad made right at your table.  The person serving it to us explained what went into the salad.  I would never order another Caesar Salad from a restaurant again.  The person mentioned that there is a video of how to make their version of the salad.  I'm gonna do it. 

Then came the steaks.  For sure you will pay a pretty penny for them, but they are to die for.  I got the 10 oz Wagyu steak and my gf got an 8 oz aged steak.  As always, she said mine was better.  :) 

We shared ice cream for dessert.  You have a choice of three of the six flavours.  We chose mango, white chocolate and dark chocolate.  In the end, they provide you with 2 chocolate chip muffins.

The food and the service was definitely excellent.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant and would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Simply outstanding. Amazing staff, great wine and most importantly wonderful food.  If you have a large group it is I highly recommend for you to try the porterhouse but really you cannot go too wrong here.

Worth a try for a good night out!"}
{"text":"I was weary about going here just because I tend to be more skeptical about fine dining restaurants that are overpriced. Yes, Jacobs & Co is expensive, but I loved every bite of it and would definitely go back (on a special occasion of course).

FIrst off the service was fantastic. Our waiter was genuine and funny and was extremely knowledgeable when asked about wines and steak. The staff worked together positively to provide prompt, efficient service. I was surprised by the ambience of the restaurant; it was more casual than expected, but was an environment made for great conversation.

I believe they have a corking service and would recommend that as there are limited wine selections on the menu that are under $100.

The other thing I love about the restaurant is that the menu changes daily including their specials, the steak offerings, and the sides.

Our Order:
Lobster Bisque
Caesar Salad with Spanish White Anchovy
USDA 10 oz Black Angus Wagyu 
8 oz Wagyu Imported from Japan
Creme Brulee
Side of duck fat fries
Side of Roasted Fennel with Chestnut and Chorizo Sausage

Hot cheesy popovers started off our meal served with tarrogon butter, followed by our appetizers. The lobster bisque was the best I've had. Not too rich, full of lobster flavour, really velvety smooth in texture, with heavenly chunks of lobster swimming about. The caesar salad was made fresh tableside and we loved that as well - I'd highly recommend trying it with the anchovy as it was my favourite part of the dish.

Our steaks were cooked to absolute perfection, and the flavour was pretty much described to a tee by our server. My favourite of the steaks was the Wagyu from Japan. It was very heavily marbled and beautifully charred on the outside, leaving every bite of steak melting in my mouth being paired with a perfectly crispy crust.

I agree with the other reviews - the duck fat fries are to die for, and the fennel side was the best dish of fennel I've ever tasted. 

They also part every patron with an individually packaged muffin, though nothing spectacular, was still a nice touch and great to enjoy for breakfast the next day.

There's something to say about the simplicity in flavours that are used at Jacobs that truly showcases the quality of ingredients that they used. Amazing dinner. Thanks Jacobs & Co and looking forward to another melt-in-my-mouth steak in the near future."}
{"text":"Visited here September 3rd, 2017 for my 1 year anniversary. We arrived a little late for our reservation but it wasn't a problem. Our waiter brought us complementary prosecco to celebrate the occasion. The sommelier was very helpful with choosing a wine. We ordered the Caesar salad to start. It was made table side and delicious. For our mains we ordered the striploin and rib eye. Sides were duck fat fries and the mushrooms. Everything was cooked to perfection. Our waiter was really nice and took our picture to commemorate our anniversary. The price is high but definitely worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Went there for my girlfriend's birthday, super disappointed in their service! She had ordered A medium A5 wagyu, sadly it came out as rare, therefore, we had advice the server it was not cook to our liking.  Sadly, all they did was bring it back to the kitchen amd re cook the same steak!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Where has this place been hiding for the last 4 years? Toronto's elite have been dining in relative seclusion for too long. Now on Yelp, I will expose this diamond in the 'rough' neighborhood of King West and it's going to be packed.  Well, at least for those who can stomach the relative expense.
For the experience, you find a short set of steps up and then back down into the former Roxy-Blu basement bar that has been transformed into a sexy man-cave. The fireplace roaring, the antler rack, TV's and live jazz music gives it a great ambiance. Although you can eat in the man-cave, if you wish, Philip took us upstairs to the dining room. Again, this place never looked to good. The window seats aren't necessarily where you would first want to sit due to the street lights outside.  So, if you are going with a group of 4-6 people, hope you get seated in one of the luxorious booths.  This is like Hollywood in the 60's, or vegas for high-rollers.  Truly gorgeous! 
Menus arrive, we order drinks, they take their time, but it's all about the experience. I never felt we were left alone for too long, but no intrusive, \"How's everything?\" every 10 minutes, either. 
Once we ordered, the pop-overs arrived.  Having spent too much time watching the food network, I know how these are made with layers of butter on top of butter.  Nonetheless, these are worth it! 
My baked ricotta salad with beets is served in a huge plate and huge portions.  Totally different than most beet salads! 
Now, I don't eat red meat. That's no problem here. However, we came for my friend's birthday and he got meat.  We had a great view of the dry-aging room. The waiter promises that the meat tastes different once aged. However, due to the lower fat content in tenderloins, this cut is served fresh. The meat comes served in a cast iron pan. And is totally the best meat ever- apparently.  
I got the black cod, which was, once I got into it, as good as Nobu's miso black cod. Wow- delicious sauce, and great with some of the supplied sauces and salts!  
When they bring the main course, they also drop off and explain all the sides- if you want to add a little smoke to your food- just use the brown-coloured salt. If you want to add a little bacon, there is a pot of creamy bacon stuff.  
The dessert menu is as big as the regular menu with a wide selection of alcohols, house-churned ice creams and sorbets and tarts and pies.  
This place was truly worth the price. A great restaurant for private events of 10-30 people. 
Bathrooms- unisex, and the walls are covered with mirrors inside!
With a gourmet cheese store opening soon next door that promises to let you experience cheese like you've never had it before, I assume this place will be the first stop for dinner after a cheese/gourmet food shopping spree. So, get there before the other uber-trendy folks do.  
Don't forget to wear your Armani- not the T shirts, the suits."}
{"text":"Staff were so nice and friendly.
steak was good but not wow
restaurant is not armed with the small touches that represent 5 stars restaurant (no flowers, no music, no table centre peaces)."}
{"text":"Jacobs & Company is a must restaurant if you're in Toronto. We had our festival dinner parties there, and OMG, the food was just amazing. 

Dinner was a set pre-fixe --started with their Caesar salad. They used thick quality bacon in their salad. Our entree options were the steak (forgot what cut...), chicken, and miso cod. Well, it was a no brainer to go for their steak w/ their famous duck fat fries on the side. Now I am not a fan of duck but WOW their duck fat fries are fantastic! The bartender told me to eat w/out ketchup and thank goodness I listened to him. Delish! The steak was juicy and full of flavors. It was soo good that I ordered the steak again for our 2nd dinner party there, but opted for their baby carrots, which were the best damn carrots I've ever had in my life. Oh man, I just dreaming about their steak, duck fat fries and carrots now....I managed to have their strawberry pastry dessert to-go. The perfect food after a night of drinking...

Service was impeccable but then again it was a special event. Bartender was friendly; he makes a mean mojito. 

You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Magnificent steak. Period.  I loved the decor.  The food.  The service.  Everything."}
{"text":"Best meal I've ever had at a steakhouse, hands down.  Andrew is the best server I've ever encountered.  After visiting three of the top cities for fine dining in the world in the last few months, this was unexpected and it was by far the best.  Let Andrew tell you what to order.  Don't miss the Caesar salad and share everything."}
{"text":"If you want to go to a high-end steakhouse this is definitely the place to go. Service was excellent the steaks were fantastic probably the best steak I've had yet. Besides the duck fries they have your typical sides which are good. But the chaser salad is a must yours fool if u don't get it ,prepared table side   Would definitely recommend it. And will definitely be going back.Is better than Shulas steak house. And Shulas is my favorite place for steak"}
{"text":"I visited the restaurant for the first time on Friday evening with my girlfriends and was not disappointed. I was the first to arrive and decided to take a drink at the bar whilst I waited. All the staff were wonderful and friendly and kept checking that I was ok. We were shown to our table in the upstairs restaurant, which is such a lovely space. Very tastefully decorated and not overcrowded with tables. The waiters were excellent and very knowledgeable about both the food and the wine. Many of the dishes are big enough for two people to share and our waiter, Michael, suggested that some of the larger cuts of meet would be suitable for the table to share. Such a great idea. We started with some fresh baked bread which was incredible, a cross between a bread and a Yorkshire pudding. The four of us shared two starters, the caesar salad (prepared at the table, even down to the making of the fresh mayonnaise dressing) and steak tartar (incredible). We all then had our own steaks and all opted for the PEI ribeye (14oz of amazingness) and our Michael took a considerable amount of time assisting one of my girlfriends choose the best cut and cooking for her. We ordered sides for the table and went for the spinach, mushrooms and duck fat fries (yummy!) and all was accompanied by a couple of great bottles of Argentinian Malbec (well, you can't eat steak without red wine, can you?). We didn't have room for dessert, but we were served some fabulous muffins to take away. We had a fantastic time. To sum it up - fantastic! Amazing service, fantastic food and all in a wonderful, relaxed and decadent restaurant setting. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing! Very high end, and high end service received as expected. Excellent wine selection and drinks. The appetizers were massive which is usually not expected at a high end resturaunt. All thr waiters are very knowledgeable, the food was ontime and hot. Will be back again forsure. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Jacob's is one of Toronto's best steak house. The price is on the higher end but that comes with the service and their options of cuts are very broad from North America to Japan etc. Their bread is yummy and is complimentary. My recommendation is to share one steak for two person with some sides and their made at your table Ceasar salad. If you have a party of 3 or 4 then two steaks would be good portion. We ordered half a dozen of oysters, Caesar saiad to share, 3 half size side dishes, then two steaks; it was definitely too much : ) but still delicious and we also had a very wonderful time. You can also put your valet on the bill which I thought was convenient for guest."}
{"text":"This spot is designed with a modern feel, has friendly knowledgeable staff, and adds that \"it\" factor in terms of steakhouses that the city really needed.  This is the type of place you just might find some athletes or executives eating at.  I came here for lunch, not dinner, mind you but I found the apps were lacking in terms of options.  I went with oysters which were good but the same as anywhere else.  I had the California cut striploin with duck fat fries and tried the roast chicken as well.  Everything was tasty but my steak was a tad above the medium I requested.  The ingredients were fresh and the presentation well done but I did find the food to be a bit on the salty side. 

This is a high quality joint, but not the best steakhouse I've ever been to when compared to NYC or Vegas.  The prices were also extremely high as I still managed to crack $100 for a 3-course lunch so the value question inevitably comes up.  But I'd come back, especially if there was a corporate account in play."}
{"text":"The steaks and seafood here are phenomenal. Best in the city. The atmosphere is gorgeous and the staff is excellent. It is also in an amazing location."}
{"text":"decent steakhouse, extremely contemporary design. everyone raves about their steak which i don't think is out of this world in any way. my main issue is they broil their steaks in a hot 'oven' and i don't personally like that way. i like wood grills or charcoal. the sides, drinks, desserts are excellent however. this is more of a once/twice a year place for me but nowhere near as good as everyone goes on about for their steak. maybe if they used a proper way of cooking and using wood oven or charcoal it would be a lot better."}
{"text":"Visiting from Los Angeles I thought I'd try one of Torontos best but I leave with mixed feelings. I must say they offer a very good variety of meats from all over and the impressive dry aging room could not be missed. I was pretty surprised with the pricing...the waygus are generally $150 and up to a $1000! I personally don't like wagyu.. it's too buttery and soft for my taste. I just wanted a good solid rib eye and settled on a 60 day dry aged Canadian beef...flavoring was very good and cooked perfectly but the meat really wasn't very good. Bit chewy. The next rib eye up from this would've been over $120 which to me is excessive. High end US steak houses hover around $65 US for a rib eye. This place is ridiculously expensive IMO. Service was excellent however."}
{"text":"\"The best steak in Toronto\" is what I kept on hearing about Jacob's so I had to see it for myself. Located west of king and spadina this non-assuming restaurant is easily missed. Inside, the dimly lit restaurant screams fine dining without being too intimidating. Excellent service from the knowledgeable staff made the expensive venture a fun and delicious one. Started with a fresh Caesar salad prepared at your table, it is without a question a must to order. Next duck fat fries served plain and simple but were surprisingly flavorful. Did the steaks follow the trend? We ordered an Albertan rib eye and Californian cut striploin. Both came a tad more medium than medium-rare for my liking and while I like a little fat, the striploin was more fat than protein. Don't get me wrong. They were good but for the high price I was expecting an unquestionably superior experience. What I got was an excellent steak but the real treat was the overall experience. Maybe the 300$ Japanese steaks would have blown me away but I feel like I can get a comparability steak at Morton's or barbarian's.  So is it the best steak in Toronto? More like best steak experience."}
{"text":"this establishment is exceptional! I've had several client dinners here, and most recently, two weeks ago, i shared an epic bottle of Shafer Hillside Select - Stags Leap - Cab with a colleague and what i love most about this steakhouse is the abundance of high end steaks from around the world but that wine was one of the best I've had the pleasure of drinking and the evening went on.

We tried A5 Mishima 
Kobe 
Snake River Farms Wagyu
We had several sides and i dont even think we touched them. The wine, as i said, was exceptional. We also had a 1994 Rioja that wasnt as beastly but all in all, good!

every time ive been here we do the tasting menu of their finest meats and the service is always stellar as is the food. 

If you've ever had the pleasure or experience of eating these meats, they are like meat candy. One piece is enough for me of the most marbled meats and really thats all you need. You need a big wine with it too but this is absolutely one of the best steakhouses i've dined with in north America 

thanks, i think i even broke a personal record for the highest per person tab. It was well worth it though."}
{"text":"Different experience than others steak houses. Exceptional steak offerings, esp the Japanese steaks.   Excellent service. Good experience."}
{"text":"I went there a few weeks ago. My bf and I shared the 40 oz Australian grain fed wagyu porterhouse...omg amazing. The steak was cooked perfectly. As sides we had the beefsteak tomatoes, yummy and the squash. Our server was really helpful when it came to picking out wine... I am a white not a red kind of gal. My only and I mean only complaint is that they don't have steak sauce which to me is a necessity.. but it says something about the steak when it was delicious without steak sauce"}
{"text":"This was my second trip to this restaurant. Dare I say this is likely my favorite steak house. The vibe is totally cool and the bar is downright sexy. Perfect drink while I waited for guests.   

As we headed towards the table, you pass the meat aging room which is totally awesome. The wine list can be overwhelming but there are great descriptors and scores when available. They are also very helpful.  Just be prepared to enjoy the wine and not worry about the price. 

We were a party of 7 and our server suggested we do a few cuts of meat to share rather than each ordering a steak. There are over 20 varieties of steak, so this was great and allowed us to sample many cuts and tastes. The 70 day aged T bone is reason to return. 

If your a steak person and want to treat a group, this is an impressive place. Must go to!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Jacobs on Saturday and wasn't disappointed. Front of house staff was courteous and informative of our reservation. 

Pros - We were seated at our table within 5 minutes in the upstairs dining area. The atmosphere was buzzing on a Saturday night. Our server was highly knowledgable about the cuts of beef and was very helpful with us for recommendations. The meal was as expected with the beef of the high quality and flavour. 

Cons - Service staff had a couple of hiccups with our drink orders and seemed confused at who was to clear the table/ refill our drink order but it was a minimal disruption to our meal. 

Overall, I would recommend for groups of friends looking to celebrate a special occasion. As a date spot, I would go elsewhere to get the atmosphere and intimacy you would be looking for."}
{"text":"I get to Toronto about 4/5 times a year and always looking for new spots. I had a rare evening free and wanted to relax with good food, service and drinks.  

Sat upstairs and the staff was fantastic.  I arrived as a bunch of people where leaving.   So once they got out, it was pretty chill. The \"couple\" next to me where pretty much to third base.  It was either a date or some paid entertainment.  Regardless, everyone knew what was going on.  

I started out with the Cesar salad prepared table side.  It was was epic.  Tangy, spicy and salty.  It's big and could be shared two or three ways.  

For the main event, I had the ribeye wagyu Pre sliced.  It came with three house salts and three sauces.  All perfect.  Steak was incredible, perfectly cooked.  

Sides where, well sides.  I had some potatoes.  They where fine.  Would do something different when I go here again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing I really recommend the Guelph steak cooked to Medium. By far the best steak I have ever had. Great service and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Incredible dry aged steak, knowledgable servers, beautiful decor - What else can I say?

You'd be crazy not to try the tableside caesar salad, truly a piece of art! The porterhouse is a great option for those who like to share. Beware of the wine list, you're not going to find much for less than the price of a tank of gas.

Definitely expensive, though worth every penny. A great alternative to the generic steakhouse scene!"}
{"text":"This place is still my favourite steak house! During my many visits in the past I aim to try a new cut each time. I enjoy the ambience and look forward to almost checking off everything on the menu. I wish the chairs were a bit more comfortable and more elegant."}
{"text":"The food is still the best in the city, but it's dropped. The margin between Jacobs & others has narrowed significantly in the food & service departments.

We came early on a Monday, and by the end, the place was loud and bustling, and it was difficult for us to get the great service we are accustomed to.  Perhaps, this is the beginning of us finding other restaurants to replace the good old favourite.  With the increasing prices for its offerings, and decreasing quality, it's beginning to be hard to justify coming here.

Starters
Caesar - Not nearly as good as it used to be.
Beef tartare - Good, but not great anymore.  This dish is very competitive in Toronto.
Oysters - Good, solid, meets expectations.  Get Kumamotos.
Lobster chowder - A pleasant surprise. Large offering.

Steaks - My wife stated that the steak I make at home was better than the one she had that night.  I was inclined to agree.  However, the Snake River & Australian cuts that my father & I had were definitely superior.  The other foods offered are still top notch.  Perhaps, we just cut back on the meat.

Dessert - The Monkey Bread dessert was far too sweet, lacking in depth & complexity.  This needs a definite adjustment. We didn't even want the leftovers."}
{"text":"Came here for the 2nd time on my birthday. My girlfriend and I have assessed the best game plan -- and bang for your buck. Although the time we went, we amassed a huge bill over $250 but below would be the best gameplan for a solid economical meal.


- Order the caesar salad and split between two people. Its $15 for a huge caesar made table side and the best you can get (literally.)

- Order a 14oz Ribeye and split it -- asked to have it cooked more (medium) to melt the marble/fat with the steak. Ribeyes definitely have the most flavour. $45

- Order a side to enjoy with your Ribeye -- either Duck fat fries, Mushrooms or Asparagus. Approx $12..

- Comes with free loaf/bun of bread.


Meal under a hundred for two people (50 each). Perhaps the smallest bill they've ever seen lol but this is our gameplan next time .. Flavours are amazing. Best steakhouse in the city. Better than Mortons, Ruth's Chris, Keg, etc etc etc"}
{"text":"One of my fav steak houses to go to. The maitre d Philippe was so nice and amazing . Our server Megan knew every detail about the meats . The ambiance , the food and service was top notch 
Can't wait to go back ."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse in Toronto. Had the 6oz tenderloin (filet mignon) and 14oz USDA Prime ribeye (aged 75 days). Nowhere else in Toronto can you find prime grade, premium cut steaks executed to near perfection. The ribeye/striploin steaks are dry-aged in-house (the best way to age them in order to maximize flavour and tenderness) while the tenderloins are wet-aged. The seasoning (none other than classic salt and pepper) was perfect and highlighted the quality of the meat. I'd recommend ordering them rare in order to really appreciate the buttery greatness of these steaks. Save your stomach for the steaks -- I wouldn't recommend the Caesar Salad or the duck fat fries. The theatricality of the salad was great, but its taste was above average at best for $15. The duck fat fries were OK. Five stars if you're coming here for steaks -- will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I mean how can you not like the steak here??? The quality of the steak is beyond amazing. Ever since my friend introduced me to this place, I never wanted to order steak at other restaurants. The food is impeccable and the service is excellent. I find the Caesar salad a bit too salty but still very yummy. I know the food is pricey, but I think it's well worth it. I can't wait for the next special occasion!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite steak house.  I order the 4oz A5 Japanese beef. It is like butter. Not cheap but so worth it. 

I love the pop-overs and butter, table-side Caesar, baked potato and creamed spinach."}
{"text":"Yes, it's pricey as hell, but please believe me when I say that you get every bit that you pay for, and then some.

The ambiance walks the fine line of being fancy enough to make you feel like a big shot while avoiding full-on pretentiousness.

The quality of the food largely goes without saying.  If you're willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for a single meal, you expect near-perfection, and Jacobs & Co. delivers.  The beef rib eye made my eyes water with joy (yes, really).  The pork rib eye was...well, let's just say that I was unaware pork could even taste that good.  The side dishes were exquisite in their own, more subtle ways, and their portions were surprisingly large.  The complimentary single-bite desserts (white chocolate and raspberry) and breakfast muffins were unexpected delights.

The service was incredibly efficient and professional.  It was obvious that they wanted your dining experience to be as good as humanly possible, and they were all quite good at doing so.

If you're a carnivore looking to splurge on a fancy meal for a special occasion, you will absolutely not be disappointed with Jacobs & Co."}
{"text":"The Caesar salad is the best in Toronto!  The steaks are amazing and the service is most often great!

Jacob's and Co.'s potatoes au gratin is out of this world.

The menu is wildly expensive, but, C'est la Vie!"}
{"text":"This is easy - 5 stars all the way. What a fantastic dinner experience. Best steak in Toronto - END of STORY. Add good friends and you have the perfect evening. 

Why 5 stars you ask? The highlights:

- impeccable service the minute you walk through the door. Amazing greeting, good conversation, they take your coats and quickly escort to your table. Multiple servers were fantastic, they knew what I needed before I did!

- Kudos for a cool beer menu and bonus points for having Beau's Lugtread.... a perfect pairing for my steak. So good I had a few.

- Amazing bread starter, tasted like Yorkshire Pudding, off to a great start. 

- Started with the Caesar salad made fresh at the table to your liking - stupid good!

- Kick ass steak selection with prices for every budget ranging from $40 - $1,025 per steak. You can get Wagyu from Australia, U.S. or Japan and / or multiple steak cuts aged for 30, 40 or 70 days. The eager servers walk you through the steak menu and are happy to answer questions or make recommendations. I had the 70 day aged sirloin cut which was cooked a perfect medium rare. The aging really enhanced the flavour of the steak.

- The provide complimentary salts and sauce / dips for your steak if you would like to add. I say nay nay to this!

- Order your side dishes from a list of about 10 options. I recommend getting a few to share. My table ordered the Potato Gratin which was so $^($@ good, I can't describe it. So rich and heavenly. Duck fat fries were also a nice addition as well. This was a guys night out so we skipped veggies.

- Deserts looked really good but there was no way I could eat another bite.

- They have the steaks aging in clear glass fridge in the middle of the restaurant. As I walked over to look at the display, the manager came over and explained the process and how aging enhances the flavour.   

The only negative I could come up with is the price... but it's worth every last penny.

If your like me and love a good steak dinner, RUN like the wind to Jacobs.

{"text":"My boyfriend and I made reservations about two weeks ahead to be on the safe side. Upon arriving, we were asked to wait (almost a 10 minute wait) and then we were finally seated. When our waiter arrived, he introduced himself but seemed to be very preoccupied with other things.. 

I asked about some wines and his wine knowledge was not the greatest, I explained to him what I was looking for and decided to go with his following suggestion. The wine did come and I did not drink even close to half. At the risk of sounding too harsh, it was everything I did not like in a wine.

We had many questions about the steaks and the different cuts and he just kept repeating the same thing trying to sell us on the Wagyu. He did not give us any explanation on the different cuts. I did see however another table getting to see a board of their different cuts to choose from. The puffs that came out in the beginning were very delicious. I ordered the lobster cobb salad as an appetizer and my boyfriend went with the beef tartar. When our appetizers came out, they had brought my boyfriend the  wrong appetizer (beef carpaccio instead). My salad had nice chunks of lobster and bacon and was great but I think parsley all OVER the entire salad killed it for me (which was not on the desc.)

Our mains were good, the steaks we went with were great. Of course we ordered blindly but not disappointed. Steaks what they do well.  The duck fat french fries were AMAZING!! 

Our server did not come to see if we were doing ok throughout our meal. After our tables was cleaned off, he came to see if we wanted any dessert. He eyed my full wine glass and did not ask at all why I hadn't touched it all night, much less offer another drink! My boyfriend did go on to order me a whiskey sour which was very delicious and made the right way. For dessert, we ordered 3 sorbets and the lemon sorbet was absolutely the best I've had- fresh and made in house. We asked for some things to go and after paying our bill, we waited 10 minutes and still no take out. We only got that after I flagged him down and asked for it.

All in all, service was terrible (At least our server) and for an almost $600 dinner I would not consider it worth it. My boyfriend and I eat out majority of our meals and try as many restaurants as we can. Unless it was to entertain clients from out of town, I would not return for myself!"}
{"text":"This is without question my favourite steakhouse in Toronto.

This time I had the 16-ounce Canadian Prime Hareford striploin from High River Alberta. At $76 it's certainly not cheap, but it's worth every penny. Our waiter, who was extremely knowledgeable about steak and a very good communicator, explained that this farm mostly feeds the cows grass but they also add other grains later on to improve the marbling of the steak. My wife doesn't eat as much meat, so she had the 8-ounce, grass-fed tenderloin from Lindsay, ON, which was leaner. 

Our waiter's explanation about the aging process of the steak was quite interesting. It has to do mostly with enzymes breaking down over time and improving the flavour. After a certain number of days, this essentially stops happening. The number of days required varies by the type of steak, but most seemed to be in the 40-50 day range. The steak is stored in a humidity-controlled fridge and develops a \"crust\" that is removed prior to cooking.

With each steak they bring out some salts and sauces. The salts are quite interesting, but I wouldn't over do it, lest you overpower the flavour of the steak. The blue cheese spread is where it's at though! I normally don't like extra spreads and sauces on steak, but this is truly amazing! A steak at Jacobs with just a little bit of this blue cheese spread will be one of the best things you've ever tasted if you're a steak lover. I can't stress this enough.

You can get your steak pre-sliced, which is great if you want to share a steak among a group, which is the only way you'd ever order one of the 40-ounce steaks, I would hope! I prefer to cut my own steak, but it's nice to have this option. Both our steaks were done perfectly medium rare. These guys have it down to a science.

We started with the caesar salad, which is made from scratch beside your table. This was fun to watch, and it really was the best caesar salad we'd ever had. There is a huge difference between this and your typical restaurant offering. You can really taste the pepper and Worcester sauce in every bite.

For sides, we had the green beans with brown butter and almonds and the duck fat french fries. The beans were interesting as they were really crunchy, and they complemented our meal well. The duck fat fries were also good, but it's a very heavy side if you're also eating a massive steak, so it might not have been the best choice for us.

Somehow we still managed to order dessert and had the sticky toffee pudding. This was a great dish and the portion size wasn't too big, which was a relief after ordering all of the above. The toffee had a really great flavour and consistency.

In terms of drinks, there is a long wine list, quite a few bottled beers available and a number of cocktails. We stuck with the cocktails and enjoyed most of them. The Pilot and the Rusty Nail were our favourites.

The service is simply phenomenal. There is attention to every detail. They even clean up your crumbs between courses!

I could go on and on about this restaurant, but this is already my longest review ever, so I'll just conclude by saying that if you're a steak lover who lives in the GTA or is visiting Toronto, you absolutely must come here for dinner."}
{"text":"Best steak I've had in Toronto. The variety of salts were amazing and made the steak pop. Tough to get a reservation, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Hands down 5 stars. 

Even if there was something missing with the food and the venue the service made up for it. 

I've been wanting to go and more importantly take my steak loving man for some time now.  We didn't get any last minute reservations the place was rightfully completely booked but got a table at the Piano bar upon arrival 

The steaks were better priced and better in quality compared to Harbour 60. Started with the meaty octopus and bone marrow.  It was okay I have a tough time finding good bone marrow in Toronto compared to what I've had in Chicago. 

For the main we had the  tenderloin and the 70 day aged Rib eye.  I feel like we should have gotten the Salad based on the reviews but I guess next time. The steaks were perfectly cooked to temperature and the char added a wonderful flavour. 

 A tip; get extra char by ordering your steak Chicago style. The sides were okay I've had better spinach but didn't care much abt wasting since the main course and the bread oh yum the bread were so good   

Service was impeccable.  No comparison!  Just when I thought it couldn't get better they gave out muffins for breakfast! Worth the price for sure.  Reservations recommended. Though I probably couldn't afford to go every month Jacobs is on top of the list for special occasions. 

Sorry no pictures. We decided the meal and experience were so good it would be etched in our memories forever. :)"}
{"text":"Over hyped and over priced. Dry over cooked steak was about as good as you would get in TGI Fridays. brown/grey meat that has been sitting under a light and served luke warm, 100 bucks for that. Absolute waste of money and will not be going back."}
{"text":"I came here with my gf for our anniversary and I did expect a lot based off reviews from other people and co-workers in general.  I had a lot of high expectations and I knew the place would be one of the better steak houses I have tried in Toronto.  I must say the place did live up to all the hype and the fact our server gave us an in depth education on the steaks and aging process was a nice bonus!

We ordered the caesar salad that everyone talks about and I must say it was a delight to watch it being prepared in front of us live.  It was almost at if we were watching a cooking show as the server created the salad and dressing on the spot.  The taste was what you would expect from any salad, but I think what you are paying the premium for is the performance of the salad being created before your eyes.

I ordered the NY angus beef sirloin and it was extremely delicious and smooth.  The meat was delicate and sliced as if I was cutting through butter.  In contrast my gf ordered the Wagyu steak and it was very delicious as well, but not as soft and creamy as we expected it to be.  Especially for the price, the cheaper NY angus beef seemed to be the better of the two!

In terms of price, you are looking at paying upwards of at least $100 per person if you're coming here for a full meal and perhaps a drink or two.  The price is justified by the friendly and knowledgeable staff and beef that is not like any other you will get at places like the Keg.

Overall a great fine dining experience and I will be coming here again for a future date with my gf :)"}
{"text":"One word AMAZING! The popovers are amazing with herbed butter . Ordered the 60 day aged ribeye steak , best steak I've ever had. Also ordered the Caesar salad prepared table side(YUM) aswell as the duck fat fries. Love this place cannot wait to go back ! Great service and great ambiance."}
{"text":"this is our Go-To steak house in Toronto. I don't need to mention that they do the best old fashioned caesar salad ever. The menu is very limited to pretty much just beef (lots of variety) and one chicken and one fish entree option. 
The wagyu is expensive but worth every penny! 
The servers are always great. 
I also like that this place isn't too stuffy like harbour sixty. It's casual but well presented and the quality of service as well as their food is unmatched."}
{"text":"Came here for my brother's birthday awhile back, and it was such a nice experience. From outside, it's hard to tell how huge this place actually is on the inside. We went on an adventure with the hostess to a dining area downstairs, and were promptly visited by the waiter to discuss the best way to order. We got three different cuts of steak, the potato gratin, potato puree, and the Caesar salad, made tableside. They give you these huge popovers to start, and they are so delicious and warm. The salad, although very cool to see made for you, was very disappointing. I found it very salty, and nothing to brag about. The cuts of steak were like butter to eat, however I was not feeling well after eating it the next few days, as maybe my body did not react well to the type. The potato dishes were scrumptious and went perfect with our meat. We finished with their chocolates and muffins to take home. Although my body had a bad reaction, I think I'd still go back and maybe not eat as much beef. The service was absolutely stellar and it felt nice to be waited on by multiple servers. This place is definitely not cheap, but you are paying for the quality of food and great service."}
{"text":"Awesome place, so far this is the best steakhouse I've experienced in Toronto. The steak are always delicious and cook to perfection. I was also very surprised by their risotto, it's large enough to be shared by two and highly delicious! 

My favorite cut from them is the Snake Farm Wagyu ID California Cut Striploin. Very delicious. My second would be their Porter House. 

Duck fat fries could've been better, was expecting a lot from the reviews left here by other Yelpers."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Friday night for my wife's birthday at the suggestion of the Shangri-la concierge.  The staff was very nice and attentive. I would give the service 4 stars. Oysters were very good as was the beef trio app. Bone marrow was very bland and I would not order again.  The steaks in my opinion were horrible.  Had the 60 day bone in and the 40 day strip loans. They were not cooked rare or medium rare and did not melt in your mouth at all. We frequent Smith and Wolenskys in Chicago and their steaks are hands down 100x better. We each ate a few bites of the steak before telling the waiter we did not enjoy them and the manager came over but did not really do anything but offer to cook us another. I will not go back. I do not understand why it gets such high reviews, even though people say the steaks are not melt in your mouth in other reviews."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in the city. No contest. Dining at Jacobs is always a memorable experience!

I've been very lucky the last two visit's I had to Jacobs because I was not paying the bill!  Both times we had a variety of steaks that were shared between the whole group, plus various sides to share and of course some very nice red wine. We started with some cocktails - I had the Monarch - highly recommended.  Their poofy bread buns are delish with butter. Seafood tower is amazing - very fresh and loaded with different seafood: mussels, oysters, crab, lobster and a variety sashimi.  Well worth it but you need to save room for the beef so I don't think I would order this again...  The ceasar salad is made right at the table - an experience in it itself and one of the highlights of dining at Jacobs.

Moving onto the beef:  the wait staff here are very knowledgeable about all of their cuts and where they are from.  It is impressive!  The list of choices is long so having some guidance and receiving recommendations is great! We let our waiter choose for us indicating we wanted some waygu, something local and something from the US. I'm salivating as I write this review because the steaks were all so good. Particularly the waygu which just melts in your mouth...

My favourite sides:
Poutine
Duck Fat French Fried Potatoes
Sautéed Spinach

Highlights:
Ceasar salad
Waygu steaks
Sharing various steaks with a group
Amazing service
Great wine list
Yummy cocktails

*and* they give you the muffin to take home and have the next day!

Next time I am going to try the steak tartare...

I love you Jacobs. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"It's always an amazing meal here. Expensive, but worth it. 

TIP call to make a reservation. I often find nothing on open table, but have success when I call.

The steak and service is outstanding and the portions are a good size. I love that you can order half sizes of the sides. 

Last night I had:

Shrimp cocktail - huge delicious shrimp

6 oz tenderloin, creamed spinach, mushrooms, and duck fat fries - all delicious

For dessert we shared the cherry cheesecake - OMG this was heavenly. Huge slice, light and creamy, not too sweet, and drizzled with cherry compote.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went in October 2017 and for New Year's eve, and the food was amazing! The Creekstone Farm Prime Black Angus-KS, USA Aged 45 days, Mishima Reserve Wagyu-CO, USA Tenderloin and the A5 Black Tajima-Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan Tenderloin steaks were so tender and to die for. 

They make the ceasar salad in front of you, you know your salad is fresh. The European Sea Bass was crispy and flaky. Really good. 
The truffle fries are so good and you gotta order it. The bread that they serve is huge...it looks like a big muffin. 
The servers are really nice. This resto never disappoints! I'm always beyond impressed with the food and service whenever I go. I'm a client for life!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine came into town and insisted we go for a nice steak dinner - after hearing about Jacobs we decided to give it a shot.... they did not disappoint. The waiters were knowledgeable and super helpful. It really was the best steak I've had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth steak , Amazing service, beautiful ambiance perfect for a special date nite"}
{"text":"Ok yes I know Jacobs so yummy right? I've had dinner here plenty of times, but on Thursday my $160 steak sucked ok. Ugh I should of said something. I ate it bloody rare when I asked for medium. I actually left most of it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night, made reservations on Open Table and scored some points. Majority of the bill was covered as a reward for professional achievements. Regardless, STILL worth it if you have a very special occasion.

Service: TOP NOTCH. While he was a bit serious at first, our server (Andrew) eventually loosened up. He was very knowledge about the steaks and made great suggestions. 

Drinks: Cosmo ($15) was well balanced and not cranberry + vodka, old fashioned ($14) was very well made, 10 year old tawn sherry was not my thing but my friend enjoyed it, Due Cuori ($20) was a Spanish dessert wine that paired perfectly with the Creme Brulee.

Food: oysters (fanny bay, raspberry point, kelly gigas, sex on the bay) - depends on what you like but tell the server and he'll guide the order process. Ours was a mix of east/west and Irish, some were small, a few were meatier- very interesting mix. 

Snake River California Cut 8oz wagu: if this is THE ONLY thing you order, it is well worth it. Medium rare, and literally melt on your mouth. Salts and sauces not needed. (Though blue cheese with bacon was amazing)

Skipskipskip the poutine, mushrooms are ok (get a half portion), starter yorkshire pudding was heavenly, creme brulee was an excellent finish.

Budget $150 pp for 2 drinks, shared app, 8oz of steak (1 hi, 1lo option), shared dessert."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! Every dish is delicious. I have a seafood allergy and the entire staff was very careful and attentive to make sure there was no cross contamination. The service is phenomenal. The food is pricey but worth it because it's so delicious. You won't be disappointed. I also loved that they give you little breakfast rolls for the next morning as you leave- it was very convenient since I had to travel early the next morning."}
{"text":"Holy cow (ha ha), was this ever a stellar experience. My partner and I were here to celebrate a special occasion, and boy am I glad we picked here. It was everything a five-star experience should be: the food was phenomenal and rich, the wine was complicated and perfectly-paired, and the service staff were extremely knowledgeable, unassuming, talkative without being imposing, and absolutely free of snootiness. You can tell that people who work there enjoy their jobs; it really reflects in their manner and their rapport with their guests. Kayla picked a wonderful wine pairing for us and I found her wine commentary very insightful. After dinner, Chris (server) gave us a quick tour of the wine cellar and pointed out the processes of the different steaks being aged. We closed out the restaurant, but you wouldn't know for even a second that we might have overstayed our welcome. A strong five stars."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. The best steak place in Toronto hands down.

We started off with the caesar salad and shrimp. I don't usually like caesar salad but the one here is great. The sauce is fresh because it's made in front of you. We topped the salad off with anchovies.  The shrimps are huge.

For the main I had the 12oz ribeye.  Tender and cooked perfectly. You had the choice of 3 salts to use. Each one tasted different. I have been to places which give you 10 different salts but 3 is enough.  Sides: Mushrooms (tasty), asparagus  (good) and duck fat french fries (need I say more?)

I was too full for dessert."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our dinner at Jacob's. We all had steak, no doubt. Outstanding Caesar salad was perhaps the food highlight. So, if you like a great Caesar, don't pass this up. We all had one of the less expensive steaks on the menu, but that didn't seem to matter.  They were great. I asked to cut my own as I don't really get the concept of having a steak arrive already cut and cooling off. Makes no sense to me, and I eat a fair amount of steak. Now, I have to say, the steak knife was not sharp, which seems odd for a place filled with carnivores. So, as good as the steak was, it was actually a struggle to cut.

The service was excellent and attentive. We thought it was great that one server's responsibility was simply to bring the array of salt options and offer detail on each. She was terrific. 

All in all, we had an enjoyable evening, we were well fed, well served, everything was paced nicely."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, the steak, the service are Top Notch A+ but you may need to break that piggy bank!"}
{"text":"best dining experience in Toronto! been to all the major players but nothing compares to the quality and service received at Jacob. The seafood platter is UNREAL!!!! its been weeks and I still keep thinking about it. will be back forsure!"}
{"text":"I went to Jacobs & Co.'s Steakhouse this past Friday and let me start by saying that it was PHENOMENAL. This is one of the best, if THE best steakhouse in Toronto..Forget Harbor 60! Forget Morton's steakhouse! Ruth's Chris or any other wannabe's. 

The restaurant is situated on Brant Street.....there is valet...i suggest using it if you don't want your car to be scratched on a busy Friday night...The downstairs is a piano bar, and the restaurant itself is on the second floor. The decor is not your typical steakhouse look, but that was refreshing. Still very classy, clean and upscale. Service=phenomenal; I think we had six people come serve us throughout the night. 

The Food:
As soon as you come upstairs, you can see the steaks hanging in a display window where they're ageing before your eyes!!
The menu changes everyday apparently. Instead of bread, they give you two muffin buns--those were delicious. We got the ceasar salad and the tuna crudo for starters. They do a table side presentation of the ceasar salad. It was really cool. Our server took us step by step (who knew there was egg yolk in ceasar salad dressing?) and made our salads right in front of our eyes.!! It tasted great! The tuna crudo was cooked to perfection, melted in your mouth and it was a generous portion i would say.

Now to the steak. I got the 8 oz tenderloin and my bf got the 40 day aged rib eye. We also got the duck fat fries (um amazing) and asparagus in hollandaise sauce wtih prosciutto, and a baked potato as sides. The steaks came with a whole PLETHORA of different salts such as black salt, hickory smoked salt..and different sauces such as argentinian chimichori, blue cheese and a soy/ginger one...of course i want to salt my own steak! My tenderloin was INCREDIBLE!! Just the colors on the inside...it was a beautiful piece of meat. 

We were feeling pretty full, my bf insisted we get the creme brulee. It is great for sharing. Oh and you get two muffins to go with your bill. Why thank you Jacobs?

You're going to rack up a good bill...so....that's a little FYI!!!!!!!!!

So good."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! They have a lot of different cuts from a variety of regions. I've had the fliet and the rib-eye and both were delicious and perfectly cooked. For sides I'd recommend the mushrooms and the potato gratin."}
{"text":"Many fancy cars in the parking lot. Too bad I left my Porsche back home in LA!. I tried both aged 40 and 90 days steaks. I wanted to go all the way to 140 days but I didn't. Both steaks were cooked very well to my preference. The owner/boss/manager was nice, he kept standing and greeting guests the whole night. I had a lot of fun eating and talking to the guests next to our table. Again, 20% discount due to currency exchange!"}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouse experiences I have had - excellent food and service. It may be helpful to know that you can order half sizes of the side dishes, this is what I did as I wanted to sample a larger variety. 

I ordered the:

- 4 oz. Japanese A5 Black Tajima Kobe Striploin -  The most delicious, marbled steak I have tried. Each bite was rich and buttery

- 14oz Ribeye, Aged 90 Days - Tender, flavourful and pretty darn pungent from the aging

- Tableside Caesar Salad - Boldly flavoured and the portions are generous. 

- Sides that are worth ordering again: Potato Gratin (Cheesy and Rich) and the Duck Fat French Fries (Order Them Well Done). 

- Sides I would pass on: Sauteed Rapini with Anchovy Butter (Nothing special about this - you can easily mimic it at home). 

The complimentary chocolate chip muffins 
given to us at the end of the meal were a nice surprise, and well made too."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here for the first time and we were very impressed! 

The service was incredible, probably the best I've had in Toronto. Extremely knowledgeable, good recommendations, complimentary surprises, and very attentive . 

We ordered the Caesar salad made at the table which was really cool to see, it was very fresh and delicious. My boyfriend had the steak which he said was fantastic - but ultimately overpriced and not much better than a good steak anywhere else. I had the risotto (good but nothing to rave about) and the steamed lobster which was amazing. 

The duck fat fries were unreal. 

They gave us muffins to go which was a nice touch. 

I would give it a 5 star because it was great quality food and service but it is definitely overpriced for what you get"}
{"text":"There are some restaurants that are simply in a class of their own, and Jacobs is one of these.
The service is outstanding; you are greeted at the door and from that moment on your every question and need is professionally catered.
The wine list is extensive and expensive. You can bring your own with a $50 corkage charge.
We had the jumbo shrimp cocktail, and, you must have, the Caesar salad made at your table...
 The thing to have here, of course, is steak! We shared two small strip loins - the Kansas Creekstone, 60 day, and the Mishima reserve,  Colorado. Both were exquisite, perfectly done, and sufficiently different to provide a very interesting meal. The sides were wonderful - snow pea leaves and inevitably french fries. Depending how many you are and how many you order, you might want to go with the half portions which are offered. 
There is valet parking.
This is a really good and expensive place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"By far the best steak I have ever had in my life! Been back about 3 times now and they never disappoint. They had asked me my reason for coming and we were having an anniversary dinner. Upon our arrival they had some glasses of champagne waiting for us. At the end of the dinner they had provided us with complimentary desert that said happy anniversary in it. I didn't ask for any of this stuff, they just did it. That was awesome. They also know their steaks. I had ordered a Rib Eye (don't remember which one) and asked for it medium rare. The waiter then suggested I actually order this specific one Medium as it will absorb most of the juice while it is being cooked. He was spot on, cause it was incredible. I have been to some pretty epic steak houses in the city, in Paris, in Vegas and I still have yet to find a better steak house then Jacobs. Oh and you have to order the table side Caesar salad with the double smoked bacon. Never tried better Cesar salad. Made right in front of you from scratch."}
{"text":"It's just ok. Lack luster service. We went with a party of 10 and spent a lot of money on wine. But still service was really lacking. The meat is ok. I have had way better steak in the city. I would only go back if someone else pays."}
{"text":"This place is good, the table side Caesar salad is amazing, the pouting is out of this world. Valet parking is convenient, went on a Thursday night and it was still packed so reservations recommended. Splurged and got the Kobe, out of this world amazing. I would definitely go back but not more than once a year since the price is very expensive."}
{"text":"Time for some real talk: this place is overhyped. I've eaten a LOT of steak in my lifetime. In fact, I was in Wyoming in February and that was an eye-opening steak experience. I have been waiting to try Jacobs for years and just never got around to it. Tonight was the night! I went with my parents for my mom's birthday. 

First off, I ordered my Snake River tenderloin sliced because that's an option. And it never arrived sliced. I was surprised to look down and see something that resembled charred when I ordered it medium. Cutting into it, it was done properly within but the exterior of the steak was too charred. It was unenjoyable. 

My dad is ridiculous and only eats his steak well-done, which is steak blasphemy, I am well aware. The waiter said he should order it medium-well and that it wouldn't bleed, as none of their steaks \"bleed\" and if it wasn't to his liking he could take it back and cook it more. Steak comes, it bleeds. In fact, I think his steak was more medium than mine was. He chose not to send it back.

Then, they ask for our valet ticket to call down for the car, but when we get down over 15 minutes later the car is not ready. Additionally, this was the longest meal of my life. 

In general, I found the experience underwhelming, especially for the price. Everyone was nice and polite but I would not return. I am really at a loss as to how many 5 stars this restaurant has received."}
{"text":"While the prices are high, you can rest assured that you will thoroughly enjoy your meal. 

Ou group of three dined on a weeknight and the service was attentive and pleasant and quite exceptional. Our only complaint is that someone who was making rounds filling water poured flat water into our partially empty glasses of sparkling water. When we informed her she quickly replaced our glasses with fresh sparkling water. 

Cesar salad is perfect.  

Duck fat fries were good but a little heavy tasting for me personally. 

Spinach was perfect. 

Steak was top notched, cooked to perfection. I had a small cut but was  fully satisfied. So many steaks to choose from and the prices really are insane for their specialty cuts but we stuck to the standard and were pleased. 

We also indulged in their \"monkey bread\" bread pudding. All I can say is OMG. It was heavenly. If you love dessert and bread pudding this will blow your mind. It is served with a side of cream cheese type dipping. Soooo good.

I would definitely return to Jacobs!"}
{"text":"I love everything Jacobs. The acclaimed caesar Salad, steak, cheese puffs, servers and even the take home muffins; everything served is near perfection. 

Steaks are excellent, with many choices of dip and sauces. You can have your steak HOWEVER you want it; I take my steak medium rare plus. 

Definitely one of the best places in town, a must go. Expect to spend $100+ per person, but the price is well justified. 

Lastly, like everyone else's recommendation, order the Caesar salad."}
{"text":"This was a good steak experience.  My best friend and I had the 32 oz rib-eye.  It was buttery and tasty.  I highly recommend the poutine, which consists of the duck fat fries but with the sinful gravy and foie gras.  Oh my stars.  What a meal!  The only beef I had with this steakhouse is that we had an early reservation and it took a while before the staff perked up and figured out that we needed to be served.  But as soon as they got their act together, the service was seamless.  Will definitely come here again for a date because it is such a sexy establishment, perfect for a couple willing to while away the night."}
{"text":"I have been to Jacobs a few times but recently fall 2012.

SEE:  The ambience was positive. Quiet enough to hear yourself think and carry a conversation but not painstakingly so. It was fairly crowded. Upscale but simplistic decor. Very poised. The type of people  I saw varied. Old, young, casual dressed, formally dressed . The common characteristic = a very large dispensable income.

EXEPERIENCED:  I had made reso's for around 10 I believe, but due to the weather I got there after my date, and it was 11:00 p.m. They never mentioned a word about it and sat me as if I was there on time, and served just as well. Their kitchen closes at 11:00 pm., but there was not even an inkling of annoyance. That is enough to endorse the 5 star rating. My date had a steak, which he said was good but went to Jacob's months later (recently) and said it was even  more amazing - this could be attributed to the late arrival. The service was amazing, you would have no less than 3, 4 people waiting on you in general and making sure you were okay, but one main server. Servers were always attentive, but knew when to let us be alone. Food came promptly. 

TASTE:  I ordered the lobster salad. It was extremely good. I had a glass of Riesling as well. Duck fat frites were very good. Everything on point in regards to the food.

FELT:  Food was amazing, service impeccable. 

FUTURE:  Would return to celebrate something special. And force whomever my date was to purchase the thousand dollar steak. 

NOTE:   As let on in the above aforementioned category, this place is expensive, but you would understand why. The salad was about $25.00, the fries were probably $15.00..steak median price is about $60.00 so you get the idea. . It is a truly beautiful restaurant and the service is great."}
{"text":"I came here with hubby to celebrate our Valentine's Day dinner.   As we entered the the restaurant we were greeted cheerfully by the female host and asked to wait at the bar while our table was being set up.  Once they called upon us, the girl guided us through the beautiful interior of the restaurant, we went upstairs to the dining area and I was immediately drawn to the floor to ceiling glass fridge containing shelves full of the glorious aging slabs of meat.  Our server was very attentive and took time to ask if we had any questions about the drink menu and gave us plenty of time to look over the menus.  Being the curious person I am, I asked him what's the difference between the Wagyu beef from the USA , Australia and Japan.  The server described to me the different levels of marbling (fat content) the steaks would have depending on its country of origin.  Obviously the one from Japan would be the most superior piece of meat, but also the most expensive on the menu.  So we went with the Australian.  We ordered the tableside Jacob's Ceasar Salad, two Oakleigh, Australian Wagyu 10 oz california cut steaks, the duck fat fries and the sauteed rapini.  

The Ceasar salad was prepared tableside and it was interesting to watch the work in progress, I did notice they used a lot of oil in the dressing, but the overall taste and the chunky bacon bits distracted the oiliness of the heavy parmesan dressing.

Next came our sides, the duck fat fries were seasonsed and tasted divine, I could probably eat that on it's own as a main entree.  The sauteed rapini was okay, nothing special.  I wish I ordered the potato gratin instead.

The star dish of the night was the Wagyu steak.  It was charred perfectly on the outside and bright medium pink in the centered.  We ordered it medium rare and it was cooked exactly how a medium rare steak should be.  Upon the first bite, I was full of anticipation.  It was the juiciest, tenderest and most flavourful piece of meat I've ever tasted. Even though it came accompanied with all the various sea salts and sauces, it was delicious enough to eat on it's own.    Of course for amusement, I was tempted to try the chimichurri and the blue cheese spread.  It definitely highlighted the steak, but was not a necessity.  The third sauce; the soy, ginger sauce was too salty, so I would avoid dipping your meat in that.

By the end of the meal, we were both so stuffed that there was absolutely no room for dessert, but we did enjoy the chocolate strawberries and take-home muffins as our parting gift.

Jacob's and Co. is definitely a special occasion restaurant, since it is very expensive.  It's not often that we spend over $100 for a piece of steak, but it was well worth it.   

We would be back again soon, since there was so many cuts and origins of steaks that we have yet to discover."}
{"text":"Top rate steak house. Very professional service staff, friendly and knowledgable. All the dishes were exceptional."}
{"text":"my 2nd time here and my experience here was better than the first time. I came here for a celebration, and they surprised us with complimentary champagne.  The service here is top notch from the the moment you step inside to the end. They offer free coat check. 

Our server was amazing. He sold us on some of the appetizer and it was delicious.  We ordered the porterhouse to share and it was one of the best steaks ive had.  

I can't wait to come back here for another round of steaks. Thank you Jacobs for an amazing experience once again!"}
{"text":"They are hands down the best COMPLETE PACKAGE of a Steakhouse in Toronto. What the dedication of a spa day for a women is, this place is the equivalent of the same feeling of being pampered in a restaurant. Service is always top-notch and I think the only place that exceeded this restaurant was possibly Scaramouche, but regardless they have some of the best servers there to take care of you. Had the Onatrio Wagyu , USDA Newbrewska, and one more that I couldn't recall, but all cooked to perfection with that proper crust. The table side Caesar is a must, along with all the other side like the duck frites are a delight to have. The best way to enjoy Jacob's in my opinion is to have the server choose a variety of steaks from different origins and request chef's choice in terms of doneness, have them carve it as well. Have it shared family style that way you a nice contrast of texture and flavor just as of you were having a variety of cheese. The dessert is definitely worth trying but also their coffee is very distinct and also worth experiencing as well. Overall my favorite and possibly my now only Steakhouse option when I want to try some niche cuts from different origibs. Well done guys keep up the fantastic job."}
{"text":"I find this place is overrated.
The service and atmosphere is good but the food was so-so considering the price you pay.
We got one of the aged 60 days steak with two appetizers (beef tartar and something on their special menu), they were good but not great great.
Kind of disappointed, although it was nice of them to give you muffin to bring home after your meal."}
{"text":"I came here on recommendation by the Hyatt Regency Toronto, asking for a good steak house. And WOW! That was a good recommendation!
This is the best steak house I've been in so far and I've been in quite a few around the world.

The service was better than everything I have ever experienced in a steak house. Not only that it was fast and friendly. The waiter took enough time to explain everything I wanted to know and gave me great guidance. He was a real pro and could explain everything about the steaks the offer. Excellent combination of product knowledge and service!

And the food? WOW! The 65 days dry-aged Canadian Prime Angus (P.E.I.) ribeye steak was outstanding and offered a never-forget experience.

I can highly recommend this restaurant without hesitating a second!"}
{"text":"Have dined here a few times now, and have tried most of the appetizers and sides. Also tried several of the steaks.

For me, these are the highlights of Jacobs:

Bread - comes at the beginning, big and poufy, served warm with an herbed butter to spread

Ceaser salad - best ceasar salad I've had. They make it for you in front of the table, from scratch. The croutons are delightful, the bacon is substantial. We order this every time.

Braised onions - my favourite side (which surprised me, because a bowl of onions typically isn't what catches my eye on a menu). But it's just so flavourful and delicious.

Lobster chowder - lots of lobster chunks in here. Very creamy.

Lobster cobb salad - really nice salad, with chunks of lobster, potato, etc.

Mushroom risotto - we order this as a side to share amongst everyone (cause we're not too enthused my most of the sides options here). 

Steak - get any cut of the Snake River Farms. We've tried a bunch of different steaks on different occasions, and there's consensus amongst us all (usually a party of 10) that Snake River Farms is the best. Perfect balance in terms of amount of fat, and it tastes fantastic. We get ours done medium rare.

In terms of what I wouldn't order again - oysters rockefeller, and pretty much most of the sides (except for the onions).

Dessert here is ok - nothing too extraordinary in my opinion.

Overall, fantastic atmosphere, and if you know what to order here, your taste buds will be super happy."}
{"text":"After my first time at Jacob's, it 's a huge YAY for coming again and again.  The service is attentive and I would definitely rate it as above average.  

When we first arrived, Jacob's toasted us with complimentary prosecco for our special occasion.  Our server also went through the steak menu in a detailed manner to make us aware of the differential between the various steaks so we could make an informed choice.

Based on recommendations on Yelp and from friends, we ordered the Caesar Salad made fresh table-side as well as the Potato Gratin.  Both were delicious, but I really got to give special mention to the Caesar Salad.  It was delicious!  PSA: You will most definitely taste/reek of garlic afterwards, but SOOOOOO worth it.  Very tasty!

We ordered the 70-day aged Black Angus Steak as well as the Japanese Wagyu which ended up being too much food for the both of us.  If I were to do it again, we'd go for the Black Angus and forgo the Wagyu.  Unfortunately, it was nowhere near as good as when the U.S. could import Japanese wagyu and we had the most heavenly wagyu ever at Cut in Las Vegas.

The steak here was tasty and the \"cellar\" of all the steaks is a great view for sure including the viewing of steaks as applicable upon deciding on your order.  While some reviews have noted Jacob's as spendy, if you stick with their tried and true menu of Black Angus or steaks from Canadian farms, the meal could definitely prove to be quite economical (relative to other \"top\" steakhouses in the GTA).

At the end of it all, Jacob's also sends you off with muffins for the morning so you can wake up thinking of them.  As if you could forget or not dream about the amazing meal you just had that evening!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big steak guy. I usually limit myself to one steak a year (shocking I know) but when the annual cravings hit I want it to be a great experience. Jacobs certainly delivered! It is easily the most enjoyable dining experience we have had in a very long time. The staff are exceptional and really take the time to explain the product to you - I now know the difference between US and Canadian beef! LIke all the other reviews the Caesar salad is amazing as is the steak. You really can't go wrong. The assortment of rubbing salts and sauces they bring with the meal was a very pleasant surprise. The decor is high end but comfortable. I was worried this restaurant was going to feel stuffy and over the top but its just the opposite. Very relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere. A fantastic restaurant that is perfect for a special birthday, anniversary or satisfying the caveman cravings for an amazing steak."}
{"text":"Still one of my favourite places in Toronto to get a steak. If that's even an appropriate word for it, I feel like the steak served at this restaurant doesn't deserve to be calling it the same name as that burnt thing you cooked on your BBQ the other day. My go to here as been the T-bone . 120$ a pop but is definitely shareable with that date you took. Cooked and seasoned to perfection. Salad is always fresh making it directly in front of you at all times. I promise, you come here for dinner once and you'll be talking about it every time you drive down king."}
{"text":"Tuesday night and it's fully booked! Honestly there's gotta be a reason. Albeit having a reservation we had to chill and have drinks in their piano room for them to prepare our table. I ordered the 14 ounce ribeye ( surprise surprise). The Caesar salad was unparalleled with chunks of beacons and strips of fresh anchovies. One friend had steak tartare and the other Wagyu. Everything was perfect but a bit overpriced. Still I would go back!"}
{"text":"Truly had an amazing experience here. I had shared a porterhouse with my boyfriend. We also shared four sides which were each uniquely tasty. The service was also incredible."}
{"text":"This is one of my fav. restaurants in Toronto. Everything from the food, service, ambiance is top notch. This is an expensive restaurant though so be prepared to dish out $400- $500 (depending on what steak you get + drinks). 
In addition to the steaks, we had the seafood platter. It included half a lobster, oysters, muscles, and shrimps. Recommended if you're into seafood."}
{"text":"Best. Steak. Ever. 

I'm not a huge fan of steaks and such, but after having the 6oz sirlion, it was melting in my mouth, it was soooo tender. 
No need to get the super expensive kobe beef. Meat is a bit tougher, and I'm sure other places have it for cheaper. 

I suggest getting the sirlion and share some sides among the group. 

The homemade in front of your ceasar salad seemed a bit gimmicky, but I was jealous that I didn't order it to try, at least once.

They also have an in house sommelier which is unique.

The atmosphere isn't as pretentious that I thought it was going to be. Lower ceilings made it quite cozy."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've spend about 7 months in Toronto this year and Jacob is def one of best restaurants I have visited during my stay! 

I went with my parents and two other friends. We were running a bit late for our reservation but the hostess and servers were very patient and friendly. My friends arrived first and they were able to sit at our table while waiting for us. 

Now the steaks. I'm a huge fan of steaks and have been to quite a few steakhouses in NYC. I had to say, Jacob offered one of the best steaks I've ever had. Both my mom and I ordered one of the Japanese meat (one was 4oz for $80 and the other was 8oz for $160). I can't remember the names and I don't know why it was not on the menu anymore. I am really bad at names and I regret that I didn't take a picture of the menu.  Both cuts had more fat in it than normal steaks, and both were super juicy and tender, cooked to perfection. The 4oz one had a very unique taste and our waiter explained to us that the cattle are growing up eating a special kind of mushroom so it  manifested in the taste of the meat. It was heavenly!! Unfortunately now I can't recall the name and I can't find it in other place either. 

We ordered some appetizers and sides to share - they were decent. This is steakhouse so my rating was mainly for the steak. 

Regarding the price, I don't think it was too bad, we spend about $800+ for 5 people, which is quite reasonable, if you compare it to those fancy restaurants in NYC."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best steakhouse in Toronto - awesome atmosphere, service is on point, and their food is delicious.

Some of my favorite dishes: 
- their famous table side made fresh, Jacobs Caesar Salad 
- duck fat fried potatoes 
- beef tartar 
- 40oz 40 days aged usda Angus black porterhouse 
- 18oz 35 days aged Canadian ribeye 
- 10oz Wagyu 

Note that the steak dishes comes with three different kinds of salt and three different kinds of sauces on the side. However, you wouldn't even need it. The steaks here are so juicy and tender itself. 

Definitely cant wait to come back again. Perfect place to celebrate a special day!!"}
{"text":"Jacob's is practically my second home and remains one of my favourite restaurants.

The service here is exceptional - very friendly and knowledgeable. Whenever I visit Jacob's, I find that I learn something new every time and move closer to becoming a steak connoisseur.

You get complimentary cheese popovers with garlic/herb butter to start, which is easily my favourite part of the meal. Order the caeser salad, a steak, a couple of sides and you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Came here as a pleasant surprise for my birthday dinner. 
The service was really good, they made some really great recommendations that were more bang for your buck. So just ask them if you're unsure what to order. 
We got the lobster salad which was delicious. It's a generous amount of meat. Lots of great flavour from the blue cheese as well. 
Then we chose a prime rib and filet with the fries. The fries were not really worth it. Nothing special about them at all. Just your standard fries even though they were cooked in duck fat. 
The steaks spoke for themselves. Excellent and rich flavour. Doesn't need the dipping sauces that come on the side because they were delicious on their own but we liked the idea that you could try different flavours with the steaks. They were cooked perfectly. 
Dessert we ordered the corn and blueberry dessert. Delicious. There was corn ice cream. Not too sweet, the perfect balance. 
Atmosphere is warm and inviting. It's not overly fancy, which is nice in the sense that it's comfortable yet a quality and unique experience. 
Yes this place is very expensive but you are getting a generous portion of food with each dish as well as excellent quality."}
{"text":"The dining experience was good. The food was also, fine. 

The only thing that was upsetting is the $20 valet parking. One drops $800+ for dinner and they charge for parking. I'd be less disappointed if the steak cost $40 more and parking was free. And that was it amounts to. Parking as the lot is literally next door. The valet showcases high-end vehicles to elevate the stature of the establishment. This doesn't fool me. I found parking on street at a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"My friend took me and one of my other friend to this place cause I help him to get a job. Personally I am not a big fan of red meat, especailly raw meat so no matter what you tell about the steak it mean nothing to me. Even if you tell me the steak was once a Paris Hilton look alike cow it won't matter to me. 

I am going to make this quick and painless. This is not a place for Average Joe. Most of the clients looks like they work on Bay Street having business meeting talking about who they going rip off next. Some are just normal dude trying to impress girl hoping to get laid after dinner. I think it would be better deal if they just hire one. LOL.

I had some 30 days age steak. \"Well Done Please\" Hahaha Yes I am a moron. The other two dudes had medium rare. I am sure they grew a tail the next day. It was ok, taste just like the 20 bucks steak I bought St Lawrence Market. Just this one cost like 80 bucks. 

We order some side one of them was Duck Fat fries. Gee talk about Lets get a Heart attack quick. LOL 

The bill came up to be like close to 500 bucks for 3 guys. I have no idea how. We did have some wine. If you plan to take a date there hopefully you score later that night or you just end up with two big ears the next day you wake up. If you work on bay street planning to rip people off. You will fit right in."}
{"text":"My favourite steakhouse in Toronto so far.  Have yet to have a bad experience here. 

Recommend the 25oz tbone and sharing it along with the table side ceasar.   Not a fan of the gratin though."}
{"text":"I went here for my fiancée's birthday, we ordered the Caesar salad which was prepared beside us. It was nice but a bit too spicy. We also ordered half size  potato gratin and the duck fat fries, which were both great. Server was friendly.

We both ordered the 8oz Japanese California cut striploin, which was fantastic. However, it started to get cold halfway through eating. Which was very disappointing considering it was a 200$ steak.. So.. this review is only 4 stars."}
{"text":"Even though this restaurant is very pricy the quality of the food is well worth paying the price. The quality of the steaks is very good as well as is always cooked to perfection. The service at this restaurant is great but can get very busy on a Saturday night therefore reservations are recommended. My favourite of of the mea is at the end they provide you with Jacob and co muffins which are great for the morning after your night out."}
{"text":"Really, really great steakhouse. The Caesar salad dressing was made from scratch right at our table and tasted as fresh as you would imagine. The steaks were awesome, but after the amazing caesar salad, really tasty bread and scrumptous appetizers, we barely had any room for steak. We definitely could have downsized the steaks a little and still have been plenty full. As it was, we ended up leaving a lot of unfinished food.

Be aware, that this is a really pricey steakhouse. Easily $35-50 at the low end for a steak entree. But, incredibly good food."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing, especially the moment when you arrive. The hosts brought us to our table and were greeted by our waiter, Cody. He was very friendly, warm and knowledgeable.  After we ordered, the poppers bread was served warm and toasty! We ordered the Seafood Tower, the Jacob's Caesar salad, which was made by your table, Beef Tartare and the Snake River Wagyu Tenderloin Medium rare and it was amazing! The wine selection is extensive, lots to choose from! At the end of the night we were also served their home-made coffee cake, which you could take-to-go. Overall, amazing as always! Definitely try this place out. It's perfect for all occasions :)"}
{"text":"Not one bite went by that didn't make me long for the next...

The Caesar salad was the most unique caesar I've ever had.  A real nice spin on such an often boring salad.  Even the dressing is made right in front of your eyes, and when you taste the salad, it's like the salad chef made a gift for you and you only!

Anyway, moving on.  The Steak.  Wooooo Weeeeeeee...Wah Wah Wee Wah.

I've never had my steak cut for me, but, it's an option and I opted for it.  Holy smokes man.  The combination of the salts, sauces and tender steak was truly a mouthgasm.  

Enough words.  Go there and enjoy yo'self..."}
{"text":"Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse is one of Toronto's premier steakhouses and arguably the best steakhouse in Toronto. It's located at King St W and Brant St right across The Citizen.

We went there for dinner on a Saturday night. We were quickly seated upstairs. We were given complimentary muffin popover bread with garlic butter to start. I ordered their famous Caesar Salad which was prepared tableside and a 12 oz ribeye aged 30 days medium rare from Van Groningen Farm with a side of duck fat fries.

The Caesar Salad ($19 plus tax) prepared tableside in a large wooden bowl was fantastic, traditionally done with egg yolk, bacon, tabasco sauce, worcestershire sauce, romaine lettuce, croutons and grated parmesan cheese. The 12 oz ribeye aged 30 days medium rare ($66 plus tax)  from Van Groningen Farm was really good and perfectly cooked. So tender and flavourful with the right amount of fattiness, definitely one of the best steaks I have had in Toronto. The Duck Fat French Fried Potatoes ($14 plus tax) were okay but nothing spectacular. We were given complimentary chocolate chip muffins when we left.

Overall, Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse was a great dining experience, the service was exceptional. It's definitely a higher priced dining experience but it's warranted for the quality of food and for the dining experience. It's a restaurant I can see people going to celebrate something or just dining with friends or significant others for a really good meal but probably not all the time because of the higher price point."}
{"text":"The place is worth the additional dollar signs. The Caesar salad is also a good idea as they make it from scratch in front of you. You can't come here and not have steak. Be sure to quiz your knowledgeable waiter on one that suits your taste."}
{"text":"So I have had my fair share of steaks in my life time and I have also gone to my fair share of steak houses and have reviewed most of them.  When it comes to steak it does not take much to please me as I'm a huge carnivore and love meat.  For this particular review I really wish that I am given an option to give more that 5 stars.  In past reviews I've given other steak houses 5 stars but I have to say Jacobs goes above and beyond my expectations of a steak house.  From the minute you pull up outside the place when valet opens the door for you.  Average parking in the area cost is $15 to $17 so why not pay $20 and get the full valet experience.  The minute you walk into Jacobs you are greeted by multiple hostesses and offer to take your jacket for you and hang it in their complimentary coat check.  We just happened to be 30mins earlier than our reservation and still within minutes we were sitting.  Wait staff was at out table within seconds to greet us and fill up water glasses.  All night the wait staff was incredible.  On the ball even to the point of bringing us our jackets at the end of the evening and calling valet to have our car ready for us.  Now lets talk about the most important thing.  The food.  It actually leaves me speechless.  The selection of steak is incredible.  Anything from regular AAA grade meat to aged meats and don't forget wagyu.  All steaks come from specialty farms around Canada, USA and also Japan.  When you order the steak there are no sides so just be prepared for that.  All sides are served family style.  I have a T-bone aged for 45 days from a farm in PEI. Melted in my mouth literally.  Probably one of the best steaks I have had in my life.  I would love to visit Jacobs every week if I could but unfortunately the prices are holding me back.  It is VERY expensive.  The funny thing is it does not hold me back from giving 5 stars because in my eyes it was worth every penny. 

Will I be back.... DAMN RIGHT

Jacobs great food, great staff, great job on everything.

10 stars is deserved"}
{"text":"Unequivocably the best steak in Toronto.  The model of what a high end dining experience should be.  Chic discreet decor.  Impeccable service.  Outstanding food.

I have been to Jacobs & Co on numerous occasions ranging from a low key meal to in the main dining room to birthday dinners in the (amazing) private room.  Tableside casear salad is a must as are the hybrid/wagyu steaks.  Desserts are good too (if you have space!).

Definitely go!"}
{"text":"A decadently rich, seared foie gras on top of a melt-in-your-mouth iron skillet steak. Can life get any better than this?

No, would be the answer in any other lifetime. But today, Amir Johnson walked in and graced us as our dinner companions for the evening. I won't elaborate on how tender and flavourful and amazing the steaks are here. After all, if it's good enough for a Raptors power forward...

The service: 
The waiters know their stuff. I wasn't sure which steak to go with out of the plethora presented. Having read somewhere that 'merican cows are injected with bovine growth hormones to promote growth, I asked the waiter to clarify. He was really patient in explaining the whole process. (I ultimately decided on a Canadian steak because of this. Big mistake. That illegal-in-Canada-BGH must do something to the American cows, because after trying both side by side...mine just felt kinda sad.)

The cherry on top: 
You will be presented with little cute muffins post dinner. These little touches win me over everytime."}
{"text":"Best restaurant by far.
I have never received such amazing service on top of such delicious food.

The atmosphere is beautiful. The Caesar salad is a must try- they make it right at your table with fresh ingredients. Although the price is steep - it's well worth it which I can't say for any other place.

Every celebration I've found myself coming here!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and service. I had the Snake River Tenderloin, my date one of the Wagyu cuts. We began with signature Caesar salads, Ahi Tuna Crudo and added the brussel sprouts and braised onions as sides. Everything, every single bite blew my mind. Both my date and I kept doing the \"O\" face. Honestly. And the Tenderloin was perfect for me given I rarely eat meat. All of the eating began with glass of extra dry prosecco--much better than the sweetness of champagne as an apéritif, followed by a glass of divine Barolo with the food and some port as my digestif. Unlike most couples, we stayed there for four hours really enjoying ourselves and taking it all in slowly. It was easily one of my most pleasant dining experiences. We will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Had a party of 20+ here on a Tuesday and we got our own room. Service was wonderful as they met everyone's needs and kept our table clean at all times. 

The started us off with their cheese bread and those things are massive! I had to split mine and share with a friend, I like it but it was filling and ended up eating 1/4 of a bun. 

We got 4 orders (2 portions each) of seafood tower and it took about 30-40 minutes for it to come out to us after we ordered but I don't blame them because we were a big group. I loved the oysters and the shrimp but the mussel and half lobster weren't my personal favourites. I also liked the crab salad but the baby scallop salad stayed untouched between most of our towers. 

We ordered different types of steaks (most of them were sold out that day but not too sure which ones) I believe we got 4 different types, 40oz porterhouse ribeye and 18oz bone in strip loin from Norfolk ON and to be honest I totally thought a 40oz was going to be massive but it wasn't all that big. I got bored of this steak and didn't stand out much to me. We also got 14oz strip loin of Wagyu beef from Queensland AUS. I really enjoyed this because it melted in my house and it was my first time eating wagyu too! I recommend you to get this cut as it was soooo buttery and delicious. I didn't try the last steak we got because I was stuck with a giant piece of the porterhouse :(

As for sides, the asparagus I enjoyed, usually some asparagus has this bitter taste that I don't like but these were cooked to perfection. Scalloped potatoes were good but super buttery, there was a pool of butter at the bottom of the bowl. Mashed potatoes were too far for me to reach so I couldn't get any (really sad because everyone says it's bomb), mushrooms were good and lastly the baked potato was drowned in sour cream which made my friends scared to eat it so we ended up leaving it untouched. 

Overall the service was great, in the private room we were able to play our own music which made things more comfortable, the food was delicious but the bill was....... LOOOOOOOOOL."}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least 15 times over the last three years. The food is consistently exceptional. Perfectly cooked steak every time. I love the caeser salad (made table-side), the musrooms, the shrimp cocktail and the duck fat fried french fries. And the Yorkshire pudding at the beggining of the meal is unbeliveable. I'm getting so hungry writing this.

I always feel comfortable here. The service is friendly and attentive. One of my favourites in Toronto."}
{"text":"the best steak in town..
if u r on a health kick don't go, otherwise, indulge.. 
wagyu was absolutely melt in ur mouth, unfortunately i couldn't finish this little piece of meat, was heavy and i knew it was going to induce food comma... 
cherry on top, def the breakfast coffee cake they give you to take home :)"}
{"text":"First, let's just take this off the table that my life revolves around food, from growing up in restaurants, setting up restaurants on the east coast and cooking is one of my favorite things to do next to eating at the top restaurants in the world.  The reason for mentioning the above is to elaborate that I believed I was deceived by a restaurant, something I did not expect from a place like this.  I'm giving this restaurant only two stars because of the deceit.  
Now, let's talk about the impeccable service, from the hostess to the servers, and the server assistants, there are no complaints there.  They are extremely professional, they do not try to up-sell or come off as pushy.  Each course was served with perfect timing and explained very well.  It's a breath of fresh air to not have to ask for my water to be filled and having very knowledgable staff.
We began our meal by ordering the oysters, all of them from Canada and very fresh.  Some notable oysters were the Kusshi (briny, clean and delicate; one of my favorites of all time), some new discoveries for my palate being the Acadian gold and the French Kiss oysters as the top of the eight we tried.  The oysters were served with horseradish shavings, mignonette sauce with the taste of piquant shallots and acid, and lemon wedges.  Shucked very well, again a great experience there.
It was the two of us, my husband and I after a suggestion by our server, decided to share a steak.  Since we are from the States and visiting Toronto,  my birthplace, we wanted to try a steak from Canada.  We went with a Canadian Prime bone in rib eye, aged 40 days, 24oz requested to be medium rare and sliced by the chefs.  Along with a side of sautéed mushrooms and the roasted bone marrow, we couldn't wait for our treat!
A server comes with three different salts and three different sauces.  The first plate of salts include a salt from Canada, tasted very pure and crisp, a charcoal volcanic salt from Hawaii which is very distinctive and of high quality and lastly my favorite, an oak smoked sea salt from England with its characteristic flaky shape and wonderful flavor.  The sauces were a bleu cheese spread, chimichurri and ponzu.  The chimichurri was a bit on the thicker consistency and the ponzu lacked the yuzu flavor and was overwhelmed by soy sauce.  Nonetheless, the bleu cheese was the highlight of the three.
Finally, I'm here to talk about the main course.  The steak was cooked to the right temperature, but after slicing the first piece of steak, I knew something was wrong.  The steak knife was dull and we were not served rib eye because the first taste of the steak made me think that we were served NY strip.  This steak is very lean and lacked the marbling of rib eye but most importantly that cap that all rib eyes have.  It also lacked the taste of 40 day aged steak almost completely.  It didn't taste aged at all, it would have been beefier and the texture totally different.  He did not offer us another choice, instead came back and explained to us that we must have received a rib eye that was closer to the strip side rather than chuck side.  That next time if we order there, we should ask for the piece near the chuck.  He had also mentioned it was the last bone in rib eye.
We were trying to enjoy our time and not become angered, but thinking back, this was extremely disappointing.  Had I just asked for the chef to explain how this piece of meat was rib eye and asked for another steak, the meal would have been rated 4 stars.  I wanted to make this post very fair and just.  Here are the reasons for the deceit.  The server told us that in the future, we should get a \"piece of rib eye that is closer to chuck\" or another comment of \"some rib eye steak is not as marbled as others\" and lastly, my favorite, \"some people don't even like that kind marbling of the steak\" tells me that this is probably not the first time they've tried to pull this off, it seemed like too much explanations for things which are not even true.
1. Ordering rib eye doesn't require anyone to ask for the chuck end
2. In some cases, one rib eye is not as marbled as others, but this steak was completely lacking of marbling except for the distinctive NY strip band of fat on one side and the meat was tight and lean.  Also, biggest problem, where is the cap?  \"oh, right, this one is closer to the strip side...eh\"
3. Of course some people do not like marbling on steak, then why would I order rib eye in the first place?!  Ordering rib eye means I want that marbling!  I would have ordered strip steak or tenderloin.
This concludes my review that we were ultimately deceived and they got away with it because I decided not to pursue at the time.  This has been a cold and hard lesson to learn because I should have taken more action and got what we deserved.  I only hope others don't fall into this trap and that they discontinue falsifying their cuts of meats and aging process to future patrons"}
{"text":"There has been so much hype about this restaurant so i decided to try it out last weekend. Service is great, really really great. The food is good but not amazing. My boyfriend and i ordered the Caesar salad, lacked a bit of seasoning but it was cool to watch them prep it from scratch. We shared a 25 oz steak and ordered  the Duck Fat French Fried Potatoes and the Potato Puree as sides, the portions were surprisingly quite large. The food was tasty but nothing stood out or felt unique or different from any other restaurant. I'm no steak snob but i found the steak a tad bit salty, i needed the sides to even out the salt level. We ate the flour less almond cake for dessert, pretty good, wanted more. I want to try this restaurant again because i just didn't get the WOW factor that everyone is saying. Maybe the second time will be better."}
{"text":"I know this is a steak house, but their chicken main is so so so good. Their mashed potatoes are also good."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place. Them ambiance was great, live piano player and a great vibe. For a appetizer I will recommend the sea bass ceviche and fresh jumbo shrimp. They also give you fresh bread at the table which is really good. For our main course we tried their top of the line steak (most expensive). I personally thought the Kagoshima 18oz was the best steak I every had in my life with perfect combination of fat for flavor and i sprinkled ponzu for salty perfection! Unfortunately my fiancé didn't appreciate the steak because in her own words \"it was too fatty.\" This was described and warned by our waitress who did try to steer us away from this cut, But everyone has different tastes and my better half gave me the go ahead to get it. What we both could agree on was the creamed spinach was not what we expected and not good. The cauliflower special was a good side dish and she enjoyed the baked potato. I on the other hand didn't really like my pureed mash potatoes that much. Overall I really enjoyed my meal but It was too expensive."}
{"text":"The service is a bit gruff for the price-point but hey, it's an old school steakhouse. I made the reservation and the receptionist asked if it was a special occasion. I said we are celebrating my friend landing a job. They said they'd make a note of it and maybe write congratulations on the dessert plate. I said I would appreciate that. Nice touch :)
  We started with drinks. I had a martini and my friend ordered a double old fashioned.  The server corrected her on her choice when she asked for no cinnamon. I thought he was being a tad pretentious but I overlooked it. I wanted to stay in a happy mood. 
  We ordered, between us,  8 oysters, 1 Caesar salad (made table-side), 1, 14oz ribeye sliced, half order of duck fat fries and half order of rapini. Essentially just one full meal. We also split the almond cake for dessert. They wrote congrats on the plate but delivered it to the table while I was in the washroom. No big deal I guess. I would have liked to have been there when they presented it to her. 
  I ordered one of the cheapest bottles of wine on the menu $130 - Hidden Bench Reserve. It was beautiful. It retails for $68. 
  The bill with 15% tip came to $468.00. Considering we ate for 1 and drank for 2, I'd say the bill was very high. 
  The service was efficient but chatty. He asked about my friend's job offer and where she worked and what school she graduated from. He told us about his daughter and her academic successes etc. He was a nice guy but overly friendly and didn't pick up on social cues. 
  Overall, the ambiance is mediocre. The tables are set far apart, like a traditional steakhouse but there were a lot of children and the brick and chandeliers are very \"Home Depot\". I prefer Morton's for a higher end steakhouse."}
{"text":"There is very little more disappointing than a meal you've been looking forward to for weeks being extraordinarily mediocre.  Oh, except maybe that it's also $300 for 2.  
I love meat.  My boyfriend loves meat.  We came hungry and excited.  We ordered the ceasar for the table, duck fat fries, potato puree, and two filets, one US, and one Canadian both aged for about two months.  We sipped on a bottle of wine and salivated.  
The ceasar presentation is impressive, and it was delicious.  No regrets about that, except maybe that I didn't write down the recipe.  
And that's where the fairytale ends.  The steak came out.  I don't put sauce or lobster or mushrooms on my steak - meat should be able to stand alone (and then you can decorate it all you want, but it SHOULD be able to stand alone).  And this meat, was bland.  It was the right temperature, the meat quality looked good, but it simply lacked flavour.  My boyfriend's was the same.  The duck fat fries were delicious, but the potato puree was too creamy, like a soup almost.  
I was extraordinarily disappointed.  This place is across the street from my building, and I would have loved for it to be the answer to my \"I NEED MEAT\" days."}
{"text":"My first visit to Jacob's a year and a half ago was superb. Amazing food, impeccable service, and all around fantastic dinning experience (as one would expect when paying $200 for one steak)! I would have given Jacobs a 4.5 out of 5 then. I was eagerly waiting for the next special occasion to dine here, but sadly my most recent visit was completely different from my first experience here.

First thing, my chair had this nasty chalk mark right on the seat, so I had to clean it myself before sitting down. You would expect the staff cleaning the tables would notice something as obvious as that. And when the attendant saw me brushing the seat, one would expect that they would help clean it, but no, guess that wasn't her job. 

Next, I found our server to be quite unprofessional. While we were in the middle of ordering, he told us he would be right back. Comes back a few mins later and acts like nothing happened. I would expect a simple \"sorry about that\" even if I was interrupted ordering at McDonalds, let alone a fancy restaurant like this. Who leaves in the middle of a customer ordering? Then after ordering 3 steaks and a fish dish between 4 people, he says that's too much meat! Again, who does that? We ordered two 6 oz and one 8 oz steak, so I didn't think it was too much. We cancelled one of the steaks, but we should have ignored his thoughtless recommendation as it was clearly not enough. And while I was ordering, he kept saying, \"what side do you want\" even though I was still trying to order the rest of the entrees. Found it very annoying and felt like he was rushing our order so he wouldn't have to rudely leave us a 2nd time. 

The last time we had the table-side prepared Ceasar salad, I remember the delicious creamy dressing. This time, the lady spent so little time whisking the oil, it wasn't emulsified at all, and ended up with a very soggy runny salad. A different server preparing the salad for the table next to us spent 2-3 times longer making the dressing, so clearly our server rushed it and did a terrible job. 

Now on to the steaks... One of the steaks we ordered was the 6 oz A5 Kagoshimaya steak for $180. The steak was completely burnt! I've cooked Kobe steak myself before and I know with all the marbling, there's a lot of oil that comes out and it's hard to cook the steak without burning it. But I thought these cooks were professionals? The outside was so charred that it made the steak very bitter. Yes, the inside portion was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, but at $30/oz, I wasnt going to cut away anything. The ribeye we got was overcooked and quite chewey and really nothing special (would rate it as no better than Keg quality). At a steak restaurant, I expect the meat temperature to be perfect, and since they slice the meat, they have absolutely no excuse for serving overcooked meat. And since one person doesn't eat beef, we ordered the fish entree and it was absolutely horrible. Tiny piece that was very dry.

The atmosphere was still nice, but after dealing with the nasty chair, unprofessional server, the soggy salad, the burnt A5 steak, the dry cardboard fish, and the massive bill to go with it, I really did not have a pleasant dinning experience. 

As I said, our first experience here was fantastic, so perhaps we just got really unlucky and had the worst attendant, server, salad maker, and cook all come together to screw up what should have been another superb meal. It will be some time before I'll consider giving this restaurant another try, if ever..."}
{"text":"Dined at Jacobs for my friends birthday (of course he picks the most expensive restaurant in the city) but it was really worth it. I had the 14oz Canadian Prime Hereford from Guelph, aged 60 days and it was a great, perfectly cooked to medium, generous portion, and extremely tasty. Next time i might try the smaller portion (like 4oz) of the wagyu or japanese beef (too much red meat isn't good for you anyways). The table tossed ceasar salad was great (and lovingly tossed by the cutest and most 'endowed' server in the place), and my friend who is a glutton who ordered the dinner sized lobster cobb salad (for $22) and couldn't even finish his steak... LOL.
Go once before you die, and please note this steak no doubt will contribute to your death....!"}
{"text":"Only need to say one thing to make this a 5 star.   

A5.  

Wagyu Kobe beef is ridiculous.  How is it possible for beef to actually melt in your mouth.  

From start to finish this restaurant pulls out all the stops.  From the oven fresh pop overs to start to the muffins to take home after the meal.  That being said, it's all secondary to the insanity amazing meat they prepare. 

Now their regular steaks that cost 50-150 are pretty special, their Kobe staring at $30/ounce is superb.  Get one of the top quality Kobe rib steaks and share it.  Unless you bring an armored car full of cash and you can buy one for everyone!!!!  

Table side Caesar salad, great seafood, rich deserts, not to mention top notch service.    

Anytime you need a dining companion, take me with!!!"}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is amazing and the food is exquisite. Great for special occasions."}
{"text":"Best experience I've ever encountered. All steaks was cool to perfection... that wagyu aged at that oh my god.. everything was so good I didn't get to take much of a picture"}
{"text":"Based on positive reviews and a pricing for the food which is as steep as Mount Everest, we expected spectacular.  It was probably one of the most disappointing dining experiences we have ever had. The Caesar salad was excellent and was the only redeeming feature of the evening. The steaks, ordered medium rare were served dry and over cooked and small portions for what we expected. Side dishes such as creamed spinach, was wilted and sautéed, not the typical way creamed spinach is prepared, braised onion was underwhelming, although the potatoes gratin were quite good. Dessert was a hard as rock brownie.  We have had much better meals as Ruth's Chris, Morton's and even The Keg compared to the dinner at Jacobs & Co. There is nothing at this establishment we experienced that could justify the prices or a return visit."}
{"text":"Oh meat, How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love meat to the depth and breadth and height and weight
My hungry tummy can take, when it arrives I'm filled with feelings of  that great sight
For each taste of meaty goodness is pure Grace.
I love thee meat to the level unlike every day's
Mostly I crave you in my own quiet need, some times while I read
I love thee meat freely, and at Steakhouses you are most Right;
I love thee meat purely, as yummy as you be.
I love thee meat with a passion put to use
In my taste buds, and with my child like faith.
I love thee meat with a love I seemed to lose
With my hunger pains, --- I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life!  Oh meat,--- and, if one is to choose,
I shall recommend Jacobs & Co as the best in the T(dot) O, the steak is so great I'll love it even after death."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I've had in the city.  Asked for a table for two and promptly seated and then greeted by an extremely knowledgeable waiter.  He described eat cut of beef in such great detail.

Now the food:

Cheese popover bread: Seriously, I would have paid for this it was so delicious.  I could not believe this was the complimentary bread being served before a meal.  I could have eaten 10 of these! 

Bone Marrow:  Delicious, you can't really go wrong with this.  Would be nice if we had some coarse salt to sprinkle on top for taste.

Duck Fat Fries:  LOVED THEM.  How else to describe it but crispy and delicious.

Steaks:  Ordered 3, a US cut steak, Canadian steam and the Wagyu beef from Japan.  US beef just couldn't compare to the Canadian and Japanese beefs. All perfect cooked medium rare.  Now the star of course was the Wagyu beef.  I never tasted beef like this before.  It really was an out of this world experience.

Overall the service was so amazing, very attentive staff!  Also we left with some complimentary espresso muffins for the next morning and they were just a continuation of the delicious food we experienced the night before. I'll be back again and again.  Price is well worth the food!"}
{"text":"I dined from fancy Michelin star restaurants in France to back woods country BBQ places in Georgia. Here goes, wine list A+,food B+,value B-. Great menu however they try and up sell you and that's something I despise. I am already going to spend $200/per person going in so slow your roll. Server came in way too hot with the up sell."}
{"text":"I went there on Monday with my most important client. Thank God I took him there based on hotel's recommendation. No complaints at all from either one of us as we have dined all over the world. 

Normally, at a pricey steakhouse, something invariably would fall short. For example, he would get a short pour on the double scotch or I would pay an outrageous price for a small cut of filet. Nothing like that here at Jacobs. 

The modern and professional ambiance is good for business dinner as it is well lit, not too dark and not too bright. The waiters and bus staff, while appear young for such an expensive place, all are very professional and knowledgeable of their products. 

Now the food is outstanding. I had a 14-oz Canadian ribeye at medium rare. It was so tender that my steak knife cut through it like butter. The sides were generous and I really liked the extra steak sauces and salts on the sides. The overall experience was great and this place beats chain steakhouses like Ruths Chris and Mortons hands down."}
{"text":"Woohoo, This IS as good as it gets (unless you're a vegetarian... in which case, move along... this isn't  place for you)!

I have been twice now, and can not say enough about this fine dining experience! The service is exceptional. The food is AH-mazing. The dessert is to die for (I most recently had the ice cream - made in house - and I dream about it now). 

I would go into further details, but better writers have already said it better than me. It's expensive, but if you can afford it, it is worth it!"}
{"text":"This is the best steak I've had in Toronto by far. They serve it perfectly cooked every time. At other steakhouses I've avoided medium/medium rare because the meat ends up being chewy and tasteless but this place nails it every time. 
Their service is also amazing and really adds to the enjoyment of the meal."}
{"text":"Jacobs is the standard ! I've had steakhouses from Tokyo to London. Outside of Tokyo, Jacobs is hands down the finest and has set the bar for excellence. 

- A5 black Tajima - Kagoshima 8 oz striploin
Wow melt in your mouth tender and buttery. Incredible flavor and the seasoning was perfection 

- creekstone farm 65 day aged 18 oz striploin was incredible if you like a little more funk / bleu cheese to your steak.  As explained to us, the marrow melts during cooking and incorporated into the meat. 

The server suggested getting both to experience the difference. We were thinking of going big with two A5 cuts but his suggestion was dead on the right decision even if it reduced the bill (thus his tip) by 30%. He nailed it and we tipped him extra for the suggestion. 


- table side Caesar salad was excellent and should be the reference version for all Caesar salads

Service was perfect - they left us alone to chat and enjoy our dinner. Came and refilled what needed to be refilled without interruption. 

If you're opening or have a steakhouse please dine.here and copy! We patrons will come back again and again"}
{"text":"This is a steakhouse that deserves a real 5+++++ stars. You can't really go wrong. If you live in GTA, this is a must try, other than the steaks, its about the experience of the service of fine dining. Not much to say, I would say second to the best if not the best, and I am looking to find out which steakhouse can be at the top of my list (above jacob&co), \"if i could ever find one\"."}
{"text":"I like it so much and definitely will go back.
went down for birthday and they put us in a very good table even though the sound level is a bit high, but that's alright.
food is soooo good. they made the cesar salad in front of you. Do try their normal coffee too, it's the best that i have ever had."}
{"text":"A friend of mine wanted to treat his group of friends after receiving a nice bonus from his work. Naturally, we picked the first \"nice\" downtown restaurant that came to mind - Jacobs.

We ordered a large variety of different steaks (including the fancy-schmancy Japanese wagyu kind) and we were VERY WELL fed. The steaks were cooked perfectly, the wine list was wide and full of variety, the servers were informative, and the ambiance was exactly what we would expect from a restaurant of this calibre.

All in all, I had a very pleasant experience.

P.S. Try the duck-fat fries. They were exquisite."}
{"text":"This is probably the best (and I think most expensive) steakhouse in Town. Second visit was even better than the first. Amazing service, great steaks, salad prepared table side, great desserts. 10/10"}
{"text":"My family and I came here for a birthday. Our waiter Cody made sure we had an exceptional experience. He was spectacular! 

At the beginning of the night, one of my guests informed him she is vegetarian and he was considerate and attentive to detail. He would inform and inquire whether she was okay to eat ingredients in various menu items 

As well, he was knowledgeable and passionate about the menu. He provided information about the ingredients, popular menu items, and explained the different types of steak and cuts. 

Overall, I would come here again for a special occasion. It's pricey but worth it. We got free muffins at the end of the night too!"}
{"text":"Well? I'm not the five star guy. Additionally, I've been to my fair share of tremendous steak houses. I have to say, between the ambiance, the general environment and especially the food: this is hands down the BEST steakhouse I've ever been to, and one of the top three restaurants I've ever had the pleasure to dine at.. 

The Caesar salad is a must, the pop over/bread was delightful, but their steak selections were hands down the most diverse and tastiest I've ever experienced. Was with a party of five, so rather than each person order their own steak, the recommendation was to order 4-5 steaks \"family style\" and \"chef's choice - in terms of the way to cook and serve\". Can't express how
Skeptical I was at this suggestion. And can't express how happy I was at the results. The 75 dry aged bone in ribeye and any one of the Japanese A5 wagyu choices are simply to die for. 

I must admit, I cannot provide feedback on the sides ordered but they looked and smelled amazing. I was to engrossed in my salad and steak!! 

The wine list, while expansive, was VERY expensive. 

However, if you love steak and value the experience, you're crazy if you visit Toronto and don't experience Jacobs & Company. Kudos to the management and wait staff who are both extremely knowledgable as well as friendly.. Thank you Jacobs & Company for such a wonderful dining experience!!!"}
{"text":"Two weeks prior to visiting Toronto I made reservations to Jacobs. There was so much hype about this establishment that I wanted to make this experience my last before my flight back to Miami. 

The second we walked through the doors we were immediately greeted and thanked for coming. The host sat us upstairs right in front of the dry-aged meet locker. The downstairs seating was very nice as well and they had a lovely piano and bar, however I was happy with our table on the second floor. We started with the table-side caesar which is 100% a must order. Watching them make a perfect caesar salad with parmesan, croutons and french style added bacon made my mouth water.  We ended up ordering the 60 day aged USDA T- Bone with Bone Marrow and the A5 Kobe Black Tajima-Hyogo Prefecture, Japan cut (California Cut Striploin). For the  sides we ordered the mushrooms, potato gratin, and the obvious foie gras! The Potato gratin reminded me of the same that my mother would make me growing up. The entire meal and all around experience was very memorable and I look forward to my next visit back! 

Great Food, Great Service, Great Ambiance."}
{"text":"Nothing short of PHENOMENAL. From the cocktails to the dessert; all exceeded expectations. 

Staff is very friendly and super attentive. Servers provided superior service (as should be expected at an establishment such as this one).

Dinner was fascinating. From the delicious bread (soft on the inside, slightly toasted on the outside) to the scrumptious dessert. 


I had the bone-in ribeye (aged 50 days) and it was probably one of the most flavorful, tender, succulent steaks I have ever had. EVER! I highly recommend dining here and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"By far the best steak house in Toronto added bonus they have halal steak options. From reservations to dessert they are amazing at what they do. 
I got their table side ceaser to start 
With a rub eye and half size potato grattin and half size potato puree. 
The steak was exactly as u ordered it  I has no complaints their bread is out if this world. 
Just can't say enough good things about this place and I'm a hard person to please. 

Keep up the standard for steak 
P. S Jacobs will ruin every other steak for you period."}
{"text":"\"As good as it gets!\" That pretty much sums up all of my meals at Jacobs & Co.. l don't give 5 stars lightly."}
{"text":"There are not enough adjectives to describe how awesome this place is! Super romantic, classy and elegant. 

Husband and I celebrated our anniversary here. The service was great! We started off with some delicious bread and surprised us with some champagne to toast to our anniversary. It was such an incredible touch and the champagne was very tasty!

We ordered the ceasar salad, spinach something (don't recommend) and some potato side dish (as you can see, the champagne was already starting to hit me). We also ordered a steak to share. 

The steak was incredible. Cooked to perfection. The salts and sauces they give you were a great compliment. 

Then at the end we got some ridiculously good muffins! 

Afterwards, we hung out downstairs where someone was playing the piano and singing. Someone came immediately to take our drink orders while we were able to enjoy the music. It was the most perfect way to end the night. 

HIGHLY recommend for a special event or a great splurge for dinner."}
{"text":"So it was night three in Toronto.  First was Marben, second was Barchef and now we were onto Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse.  So if you have read my other reviews, you know now that Friday obviously consisted of me talking about needing a ribeye every hour on the hour with my coworkers.  But they were good sports about it. 

So once again, had done some research and Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse seemed to have just what we were looking for. Nice modern steakhouse atmosphere, an extensive menu and excellent word of mouth.  

Let's get right to it.  I had the following along with a mix of various shared sides at the table among our party.  

Jacobs Caesar Salad $15
(prepared tableside)
Add Spanish White Anchovy $4

USDA Prime Black Angus-Nebraska, USA
Aged 38 Days - Ribeye - 14 oz. $48

The salad was delicious as were the sides.  But it comes down to the ribeye.  And I can honestly say this is one of the best, if not, best ribeye I have ever had in my life.  It literally melted in my mouth with every bite.  I can't even begin to explain how amazing it was.  The sad part was that I wasn't able to finish it all.  After everything I was just too full.  But don't get me wrong, I went about 10 bites or so past food coma to the point of being uncomfortable.  But there is nothing to complain about there, because then someone suggested Fernet as a digestif, which I was not aware of, and it completely worked.  So credit goes to them and for Jacobs & Co. for having Fernet.  So a win win.  

So what the hell Toronto? It was night three of the restaurant and bar night tour of 2012 while there for work.  And of the three nightly selections, the result was a hat trick of 5 Star Yelp Reviews.  Jacobs & Co. made the cut of being another very highly recommended restaurant.  I definitely plan to make a trip back to Toronto at some point.  The first impression simply topped the charts. Now go make reservations at Jacobs & Co.!"}
{"text":"I regularly go to Ruth's Cris and Keg and I could tell you that both of those establishment has got nothing on this place. Classy and discreetly tucked away on King West, I probably had the best steak of my life here. I ordered 6oz. Australian Wagyu medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. They even offered to cut the steak. We also ordered the Ceasar Salad prepared table side and it was perfect. Overall, it was a great experience. The place, when full, can be a bit noisy. Came here with a group of 4 and our bill came to $600 (tips included). Would come back here again. and again. and again. Tip: $40 corkage fee for every 750 ML to those of you who would like to bring their own wine."}
{"text":"Worth every penny.  I usually watch YouTube food blogs and dream about having a wagyu.  My mouth would water with wonders of how it would taste like.  Jacob and Co didn't disappoint serving me my very first wagyu.  First of all the atmosphere was great, service was pretty impressive.  The server that served us just didn't recommended meals but also explained each type of meat and cuts.  Side orders was okay, but I really didn't go for sides.  I do recommend oysters as appetizers.  Would come back in a year or so for some Kobe beef.  The only down side is the price.  But you do get for what you pay for."}
{"text":"Best place ever! From the freshly prepared Caesar salad to the in-house dry aged beef to the wine menu. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Great Service.. 
I can easily say this is the best steaks i have ever had (to date) in my entire life. 

This place is heaven for me!!"}
{"text":"Caesar salad was excellent.  Shared the PEI and Hereford Ribeyes, which are the less expensive Ribeyes on offer.  They were cut for sharing.  Three types of salt, and three sauces brought for dipping, including double smoked bacon and blue cheese, chimichurri, and ponzu.  The steaks, salts, and sauces were perfect.  Took 4 half sides, creamed corn, rapini with chili flakes, sautéed spinach, and braised onions.  All sides were excellent.  The cheddar rolls to start the meal were only good, not great, but that's quibbling.  They bring chocolates and muffins at the end of the meal, on the house (to be eaten at home because I was stuffed).  Service was impeccable.

You'd be hard-pressed to find a better steakhouse, anywhere."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the steaks we ordered were great. However, our whole experience was sullied by the waiter with the British accent known as AKBAR.  

Initially, our party only wanted drinks to go with our steaks, AKBAR insisted that we order sides.  He even said that \"the steaks come with sides\" verbatim.  Everyone at the table was under the impression that we would not be charged extra for the duck fat fries and mushrooms that we eventually ordered.  (Everyone except for my friend Terrio who was very suspicious.) 

When the bill came the sides were added to the total to our dismay.  The issue is not the fact that we had to pay an extra 40$ split amongst the table.  The heart of the matter is that we were bamboozled into adding to our bill and in accordance, the tip.  

Our only request is for AKBAR to be FIRED  or to be compensated fairly.    

Thank you for your time."}
{"text":"Best steak I've ever had. Excellent service as well. We've been raving about this food nonstop for two weeks. Yes, this is an expensive menu -- but well worth the price, I assure you. Take your dogs the leftover bones!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for the longest time and I finally did it! To be honest I expected more from the food. They advertise themselves as being the best steakhouse but yet the steaks we ordered were not exactly the way I like them. Yes they tasted ok but it definitely was not the best steak I had (and I so wanted it to be). We went with waiters recommendation and order a slice of Japanese beef paired with aged Aaa steak. Both were quite fatty for me as I prefer my steak a bit leaner.
On a separate note the service was fantastic, and I really liked the decor. The place is expensive so be prepared to splurge a few hundred dollars for a good meal."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend there for his birthday in June and the experience was phenomenal. Our waiter was knowledgeable and laid back. Service was prompt and subtle (the support staff moved discreetly and fast) and the food was amazing. 
Obviously, the place is pricy but that's kind of a given when you make a reservation at a place like this. The price is justifiable for the experience that you receive. 
My favourite part is that at the end of your meal you get complimentary muffins to take home with you for the following day (which are delicious) and an endless amount of soft bread with different butters during the meal. 
I walked out of there with a big big smile at the end. Once I save up some money, I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I have been to a few other steakhouses in Dallas, Texas and in Montreal, Quebec, and by comparison, Jacobs is by far the absolute best steakhouse in terms of bang for your buck.

The quality of the appetizers are incredible, and portion size is enough to feed two with ease (or one intensely hungry individual ;)). We ordered the Caesar salad and poutine. The Caesar salad feeds 2!! We politely asked if we could get pictures and a video of the salad being made (since it is made tableside), and we were shyly granted our wishes, which was nice. :). They also custom make the salad in the sense that if you have any allergies or don't like certain ingredients, they will make sure that the salad, even if shared, respects individual preferences for use of ingredients.

The poutine was excellent also - not too salty from the gravy, but a nice kick to it. 

The one thing that I definitely noticed with Jacobs is that once you start getting food, more just keeps coming. You're never sitting there with nothing to eat on the table. Often times we kept getting more dishes before we were finished.

From beginning to end - being seated to eating, payment of the bill, and exit of the restauarant, it took us just over an hour  (maybe closer to an hour and a half - I'm sometimes a slow eater :( ) on a busy night,  which covered 2 salads, bread, 2 steaks, poutine, a cocktail for my boyfriend and a birthday chocolate treat (see images). The price was very reasonable for quality and portion, so I was pleasantly surprised.

This restaurant is definitely as great, if not better, than all that the reviews say it is. It's great for business meetings and intimate dinners for couples or small groups. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This was the most amazing steak I have ever had. I went here for my mom's birthday and we ordered the Snake River tenderloin. Expensive, but COMPLETELY worth it (thanks for the suggestion, fellow Yelp-ers :) ) The only annoying part was that they charged us $5/person \"plating fee\" for our birthday cake.. Other than that, great time, great ambiance, great service all around. I would definitely recommend this for any big occasion!"}
{"text":"Went here for an anniversary dinner as my husband is a big fan of steaks and I'm a sucker for good food. Overall, good food and pricey but the portions are (in my opinion) large for further details please read on. 

for starters we shared the Caesar salad ($18) - it's made fresh at your table from scratch, they ask if you would like bacon and cheese (YES PLEASE!) then they start crushing up the peppercorns right in the bowl. It was okay, if memory serves me I prefer the table side made Caesar at the octagon (yonge and center), BUT the double smoked bacon bits were AMAZING! I was wondering if i could just get a side plate of those! 

For wine - 6 oz glass of the California cab ($20) -can't remember the exact brand but there was only 1 cali cab on the menu in glass format.  It was a good glass of wine, surprising flavour for a cab - light, nice bit of spice, but lacking legs and not tannin heavy.  but I strongly believe the wine prices are a bit out of whack.   

Cheese popovers - free with your order - crispy outside and empty middles as they should be. 

Canadian Prime Hereford-Guelph, ON -Aged 45 days- California Cut Striploin 8oz $42 -  I asked the waiter about recommendations, basically Jacobs is known for aged beef, so please do yourself a favour and ORDER THE BEEF! It comes out on a warm skillet ready for you to cut into. I like my steaks med well and it was cooked to perfection with an excellent crust on the outside. It was a very large cut of meat for me (i usually go for the 6 oz and sometimes take 1/2 home). I ended up taking about 5 oz. home in a doggy bag. accompaniments: it came with 3 different salts and a chimichuri, blue cheese bacon spread, and a ponzu sauce. i hate blue cheese but I LOVED IT on some of my steak with the yummy double bacon.... I'm going to dream about that bacon....    

Duck fat fries $14 -My hubby always gets the fries. I had to give them a try, its a duck fat fry with tarragon. 'nuf said. This was also doggy bagged (i had 1 fry and my hubby had maybe 5) 

Mushrooms $16 - as I need to cut down on my high fat and high acid producing foods and the majority of their sides are either made with butter or tomatoes.  I asked if they could limit the butter that they use to saute the mushrooms, they offered to do them in olive oil instead (bonus!). It is a mix of wild mushrooms, LOTS of mushrooms. I think a table of 4 could have split this side easily. (my husband hates mushrooms so this was all on me - we bagged 3/4 of it) 

We shouldn't have ordered dessert because we were both sooooo full BUT it is our anniversary so we ordered a creme brulee ($14) and french press coffee ($7).
Creme brulee - thick sugar shell (if you like that kinda thing) and a good amount of custard, I've had better (Celestin) on mount pleasant and I've had worse. It was okay. As for the coffee, they actually brought out a french press with fresh brewed coffee so if you just wanted a cup... look elsewhere.  Also of note, when you ask for the bill they brought us a coconut macaroon and a chocolate something  as well as individually wrapped coffee cakes so we really didn't need to order dessert. 

Service - EXCELLENT! really top notch. Our waiter was super friendly and helped us with the menu and anything else we had questions on. we never went with an empty glass and they packed up all my food without judgement. 

 Lessons learned for next time: app - only order 1 dish, Main probably could split a steak and 1 side, and no need for dessert but splurge if you want to :) 

Overall good resto - just didn't realize how big the portions would be so we felt very wasteful BUT we have enough food for 2 more meals for tomorrow. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Only OK - I didn't have the steak and can't speak for it, but the rest of the food was good; didn't blow me away. Service, however, was fantastic - our server spent a lot of time checking back in with me. 

The popovers with garlic butter they give you to start your meal are lovely. Easily my favorite part. 

The cocktail shrimp are $8 a piece - outrageous but hey, if you're into that kind of thing... They were too meaty for me to finish even one. 

Caesar salad was fun to watch being made, but not the creamy type you'd traditionally expect. Oily and spicy! Interesting but not my thing. 

Lobster chowder was lovely. Too many tomatoes, but the chunk of lobster tail included was a lovely surprise and quite good. 

I didn't care for the European sea bass, but I'm not much of a whitefish person. 

Out of the sides, I tried the asparagus (enh), potatoes gratin (yummy), mashed potatoes (yummy), rapini with anchovy butter (meh), mushrooms (enh). Nothing to blow me away. Heard the onions were good (sauteed in chicken broth). 

The desserts were lovely - rich and creamy creme brulé, and the sticky toffee pudding was not as heavy as expected. I LOVED the brittle it came with! Delicate and nutty. 

The muffins to end the meal were a lovely touch (for your breakfast), as were the little plates of cookies. 

Atmosphere was unremarkable - nice but not special. You are always surrounded by the rich and famous, so again if you're into that.. It seems to be a favorite of professional athletes. We were accompanied by a well known hockey player and a football player, respectively. 

Vegetarians will be bored.

I HATE that they have foie  gras."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for dinner on my birthday, tyty! :D
5/5 stars for both service and quality of food. 
We will definitely come back for more steaks :)

DRINKS:
2011 \"Il Tarocco\", Chianti Classico

JACOBS CAESAR SALAD with white anchovy (5/5)
Since we ordered all steaks for the mains, the salad to start with was a good choice. Part of the points are allocated to the presentation of this dish, they prepare it in front of you. A mini-show & a good food experience :D

SNAKE RIVER FARMS WAGYU-ID, USA
* STRIPLOIN (5+/5)
SO DELISH! The wagyu beef melts in your mouth.  It's super soft and tender and we didn't really need to use the knife to cut it. So delicious - highly recommending this!! :)

USDA PRIME BLACK ANGUS-NE, USA [AGED 90 DAYS]
* RIBEYE (5/5)
This was also a great choice - but the Snake River Farms Wagyu definitely takes the win for the night. Both of our steaks were cooked medium-rare :)

DESSERT:
HOUSE CHURNED ICE CREAM & SORBET (4/5)
(chocolate chip cookie dough, toasted coconut & mango)

I chose the chocolate chip cookie dough and toasted coconut flavour and my boyfriend chose the mango flavour. Mango and coconut were GREAT - the chocolate chip cookie dough was okay.

We were going to order the cheesecake but we got too stuffed from the meats at the end haha. When we come here again, cheesecake it is. :P"}
{"text":"best steakhouse in toronto. staff is knowledgeable on different cuts of meat and don't hesitate to give their opinion (which in this case is good) make sure you try the Cesar salad, you will not regret it"}
{"text":"the food is excellent! great customer service. Amazing place to enjoy the night. steaks, shrimp,  creme Brule was amazing!  love that you can see the aging meat through the clear glass."}
{"text":"This is easily a 4.5 star restaurant!

From the start to finish, I have to say that I was super impressed with the service! I made my reservation directly on the website through OpenTable. It was quick and easy. There was a comment box where I put that I wanted to get a dessert with a candle on it for my bf, which was super convenient because I didn't have to tell the waiter on the day of and ruin the surprise.

On the day of, I got a confirmation call from Jacobs & Co. The person was super nice over the phone and asked if I wanted to order the dessert in advance so they could get it all ready and we didn't have to look at the dessert menu. This was super efficient and helped reinforce the surprise element (my bf had no idea!) 

When we got there, we were greeted at the door by a very sweet hostess. The hostess inside walked us upstairs to our table. I was surprised at the beautiful lounge area. There was a pianist and piano bar area and it looked like such a classy place to chill after work or on a Friday evening. I would go back to do this!

Our waiter was super knowledgable and friendly. Since we don't know much about steaks, he took the time to explain where each cow came from, what they were feed and how this affects the taste of the steak, and even assessed what we liked, and offered recommendations! We ordered:

Bread (free) - warm and buttery goodness!

The infamous caesar salad - I was super impressed with the amount of ingredients that was in the salad and that it took the server about 15 minutes to make it in front of us. My only tip for improvement is to indicate on the menu that the salad is spicy because tabasco sauce is added. If I knew this, I would have asked for that to be omitted since I am a weaksauce for spice. We didn't see all the ingredients on her table either. This was a pretty great salad if people like a little kick in their caesar. You can taste each ingredient and the bacon is made with real chunks of pork. 4/5

Duck fat fries - you can taste the duck flavour, which was pretty good. 4/5

We decided to get two steaks to share so we could try a little bit of each. I loved that they cut it for you so that you don't have to do the work. It's ready to share the moment you get the steaks! We got the Canadian Prime Hereford-Guelph, ON Ribeye 14oz that was aged for 65 days and the A5 Black Tajima-Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, California Cut Striploin 4oz.

The japanese Striploin was to die for! It was melt in your mouth delicious. It was honestly like an orgasm in my mouth. I absolutely loved it! It had a sweet taste to it and it was very rich in flavour! A must try! Pricey, but definitely worth the experience. 5/5

The ribeye was really tender and juicy. It was pretty fatty to me and to be honest, I was too spoiled by the Striploin to truly think anything else could be better. However, the ribeye was very nicely flavoured and definitely a steak better than ruth chris or the keg, in my opinion. 4/5

They also gave us a bunch of sauces, honey goat cheese, and other condiments, but we really didn't need them at all. In fact, we thought the sauces and such ruined the taste of the steak so we didn't use them.

2oz Foie Gras - This was pretty delicious and flavourful. I haven't had foie gras in years so I can't really compare, but this was very juicy and tender. 4/5

Chocolate Walnut Brownie - this was amazing!!! Rich chocolatey flavour brownie with lots of walnuts. The ice cream was toasted marshmallow, which is pretty unique. There was a long piece of marshmallow, which added to the favour of this dessert. ME LIKIE! 5/5

Two chocolate sweets (free) -  a nice touch. if you just wanted a bit of sweetness and don't want to spend on dessert (or you rather get something else for this price) then this is good enough!

All of this was followed by the infamous chocolate chip muffins that we got to take home for the next day. They were delicious when we both had it for breakie! Soft and moist!

We left super full and then some. The bill came up to around $300 with tax and tip. We didn't get alcohol. Definitely a fine dining restaurant that served its purpose of a special night out to celebrate a special occasion. My bf loved it!

This may be TMI, but the following day, my stomach was in knots. I suspect it was the amount of richness and butter that was used to prepare the food. I don't normally eat a lot of butter so it makes sense why I was having gastro issues the next day. My bf was completely fine and woke up still full from the night before!  A fine restaurant that gets you that full - BONUS! ;)

Finally, we had leftover ribeye and duck fries that we ate 3 days later. We fried the steak a bit to heat it up and it was STILL as delicious as the day we tried it. The fries were a little soggy, but edible.

Overall, I would definitely recommend Jacob and Co for a special occasion or for the steak lovers out there. Definitely one of the best steakhouses in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Take in mind that I am not a fine dining aficionado nor am I a steak lover but our group of 5 nibbled on the following selections:

- a 40oz porterhouse (US)
- a 25oz T-bone
- a 8oz california cut striploin (1 from the US, 1 from Western Ontario)
- Caesar salads x 2 (tableside)

The combination together was enough to keep us all satiated

As for the steaks, they were absolutely delicious, tender, juicy, cooked to what we had asked for and expected.  As a non-regular-redmeat-eater, the steak was simply, and crudely put, -the- shit. 

The cheese popovers served as a bread app, the shortcake cookies, and the take home muffins at the end of the meals were nice touches and definitely filled a void or two.

I can also vouch for athletes eating as I spotted a famous ex-Raptor now-Knick NBA player.  I also saw Susur Lee come in so I figure it has the stamp of approval from someone who must have a more refined palate than myself.

This place is insanely indulgent for regular folk, I had to dock one star for being a tad prohibitively expensive for what it is.  The caesar salad is a great experience and I'm sure you can mark your steak up because you have meat aging experts on staff but $21 for a Caesar salad portion, whether homemade or made tableside, is fairly out of reach for most people (I would say)."}
{"text":"Amazing.
Such a special evening out .... And a Cesar salad to die for."}
{"text":"Not only was this one of the most incredible meals I've ever had, but the service was also amazing. Our waiter was really attentive, quick to refill our waters, and knowledgeable to explain the different wine choices or menu items.

I would recommend getting their famous Caesar salad that is prepared table side as an appetizer to the steak. It was fresh, and unlike the typical Caesar salad served in other restaurants.

Although a pricier option, I say that the Jacobs experience is definitely worth trying for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food.
Big selection for wine, they also give us 2 muffins after dinner.
Interesting experience for tasting aged steak."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I don't think that Toronto offers the best selection for the discerning carnivore (a la Montreal), but compared to what else is on offer, this place is pretty darn awesome.  I've been to Morton's and Ruth's Chris several times (still saving up for Harbour 60), and 90% of the time am left disappointed: bad service, excessively noisy dining rooms, poorly dressed patrons (come on people, you're paying $120 for a steak, please put on a pair of slacks or nice jeans), and overcooked meat.  

Jacobs however was a breath of fresh air.  The atmosphere was great: a light/airy dining room, very friendly (and knowledgable) wait staff, and an overall great vibe.  Many folks talk about how it's mostly the stuffy Bay St. crowd - but the crowd on Saturday was pretty diverse: professionals for sure, but also lots of well to do families, young couples, elderly couples, and a big bachelorette party - I didn't feel uncomfortable at all.  

I started with a G&T (nothing special) and the table-side caesar salad, which was probably an 8 out of 10 - I don't think the lettuce was crisp enough and the waiter put too much dressing on, but I'm a sucker for retro style / DIY food.  We consulted the waiter for steak selections who obliged us with a lengthy and thorough walk-through - I think he could have conducted a 2 hour lecture if we didn't stop him. We ultimately went for a 40oz Limousin porterhouse, cooked rare plus.    We also ordered a side of rapini and the duck fat fries.  The sides were... meh....and I think I should have gone with the foie gras poutine instead, but at least they were what they purported to be.  The steak was tender, flavourful, melt-in-your-mouth, vegan-killing, why-do-we-bother-with-chicken, let's-buy-our-own farm awesome.  Cooked to perfection with just the right amount of seasoning.  We had a pretty run of the mill Cab Sauvignon to match, which served its purpose.

Suffice it to say, if I'm in the mood for great steak, and not worried about shelling out some dough, this is my new go-to place."}
{"text":"Had an excellent anniversary dinner here and it was still busy on a Monday evening , kinda gives you an idea of the quality. 

Our server treated us with generous care and offered comp proseco to start. I haven't been here in a few years but the table side Caesar salad and duck fries are still very consistent. 
Our steak was cooked to perfection and was exactly as recommended. 

Best of all, they still finish the night off with take home muffins to reminisce the experience  the next morning. 

I still think that Jacobs is one of the few Steakhouse's in Toronto that offers a wide selection of steak cuts at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The famous Jacobs! It was good but be prepared to splurge. 

Complimentary cheese popovers (5/5) - my favorite part of the meal. Fresh & hot, the outside is a little hard but the middle is soft bread. 

Caesar Salad ($19 +$3 for 2 pieces of anchovies) (4/5) - this was good, I liked the anchovies and the spicy kick from the Tabasco. Big chunks of real bacon. Prepared table side, but I felt it was redundant because there was no introduction or interaction between us and the server. I noticed this was not the case with other tables though. 

Beef Tartare (2/5) - possibly the least appetizing presentation of beef tartare I've had. The toasts were super hard. I found the meat paired better with the lettuce - this was easier to eat and brought out the beef flavor more, though I couldn't taste the truffle oil.

Creamed Spinach (3/5) - I like how you can order half portion for the sides. Pretty good - the spinach is more on the raw side vs. very cooked & creamy. 

Red Top Farms Wagyu - MO, USA - Bone in Striploin 18oz ($270) (4/5) - no doubt the meat is flavourful and soft, but it was too salty for my taste.  They provide a side of 3 salts & 3 sauces - I liked the chimichurri sauce the most. Good for sharing between 2 people. 

Complimentary whisky-filled chocolates & take-home chocolate chip muffins was a nice touch.

The dining room was a bit loud, definitely upscale vibe."}
{"text":"The Australian wagyu we ordered was great but of course a bit pricey. we had to order some other food to make us full.

 I understand it's a steak house so there's limited option of food other than steak. the pork we ordered i think it's soso; kinda rough and overcooked. the baked potato with wagyu brisket is ok. the lobster cobb salad is good I wish there's more sauce to it though so that the flavors will blend together.

I mentioned on my reservation that it's for my friends birthday and they prepare little chocolate macaroon with candle (I actually forgot that I requested it on the reservation). Taste like it's from the fridge and too sweet but whatever it's free and represents their attention to details. Also got muffins which taste gd."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in all of Toronto!
Best Steak, Lobster, Oysters...."}
{"text":"Does Jacobs & Co really need more great reviews? I'm thinking no, but here's mine anyway. 

The service here is amazing, they have an abundant of wait staff that are floating around and are ready to tend to any table in need of anything. It's a great team environment, they all serve each others tables which makes everyone, customers and staff, happy.  

The caesar salad here kicks serious butt. It's the best caesar I've ever had in my whole life. The dressing is made table side (from scratch) and it's as good as it's reputation. You MUST try it once on your life. 

They have soo many different types of steak that it's hard to pick. We had cuts from around the world, Wagyu from Japan, Wagyu from Snake River and a cut from Ontario. The Wagyu from Japan was by far the richest, most tastiest of all however also the most expensive. All the steaks were cooked just the way we asked - medium rare, perfect!

I've also had the 60 day aged ribeye before, which is on the lower spectrum of pricing and it was amazing, so if you aren't ready to shell out $196 for a wagyu ribeye, this is a good compromise and you won't be disappointed. 

For four of us, the bill was four digits = VERY pricey. You get what you pay for here. For the die hard steak fans, this is the place for a damn good wagyu. If you're not into steak, sorry this place isn't for you."}
{"text":"My 3-star rating reflects the price-quality relationship and does not mean the three stars I gave the Mexican place around the corner measures up to the steak here. I simply thought Jacobs was a little overpriced for the meat on offer. It just also is not my scene: the flash-a-flash of King West, if you will.

I was very much impressed by the beefy knowledge of the waiter, however, and would liken him to a cow connoisseur of sorts.

(If you are choosing between here and Harbour Sixty, go with the latter)"}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic. From the cheese pop bread to all the entrees. Our server Steven was super professional. Explained everything w a passion. I think he truly believes the restaurant is the best in town. Lol.... 
I'm giving it a four star simply because of its price. Sure the steak was great but in my opinion, nothing is $200-300 good..... I'd recommend not letting the chef precutting the beef.  It got cold so quickly. Plus that day we were there the AC was on so strong (or it was a cold night) and all of our dishes got cold so fast, which was a shame. the organic chicken and mushroom risotto were great too. Even my little kids loved them. Chinese greens (snow peas leaves) and the duck oil fries were good but not mind blowing. The cheapest glass of wine was $22 for a six oz glass. And there was a wine menu that's like a novel. Some where $7000 a bottle. Wow. They were so nice to give us a plate of chocolates made by Brandon Olsen w a candle. In the end, those chocolate chip muffins were prob the best muffins I've had in my life. :)"}
{"text":"Our mains were perfection, however, the server we had the misfortune of getting stuck with plays favourites. My boyfriend and I visited Jacobs last night and had our experience completely ruined when a group of 8 men (they appeared to be athletes) were seated next to us. We were nonexistent from then on. We were ignored after our mains were delivered to us. When we finished our mains, we sat waiting for a long time to have our table cleared, and after it was cleared it took forever to get the dessert menu. A $700.00 dinner should never come with this type of service. It's such a shame because the food really is outstanding... except for the vanilla butter cream cake, you can skip this, it's dry."}
{"text":"Wow. 5 stars all around.

Décor & Ambience - Very modern and nice, they have their dry aging meat locker in full view for customers, which was so cool to see. Their wine cellar was beside it. They have a bar area with TV's which is also really nice to have, so it's not just an upscale steak place. Everything was clean and nice. I came straight from work, so I wasn't dressed super nice, but this place doesn't make you feel like you needed to be dressed up really nice. That being said, I wouldn't walk in here dressed in a tank top and shorts or something.

Food - We got the Caesar salad which was prepared tableside by our server. It was so good! We were able to share one between three people as a decently sized app. We added the anchovies for $3. We also got the oysters rockafellar, which was in my taste a little too salty. There was chorizo sausage on top and it was really overpowering, could not even tell there was an oyster in there. I would skip it next time.

It was just us three girls, so we decided to share a 65 day aged USDA 40oz porterhouse and it was amazing. Perfectly cooked, tender, and so flavourful. It was conveniently sliced up for us so we could share it. We couldn't even finish this lol. It was pretty amazing though.

For sides, we got the in season, fresh creamed corn, duck fat fries and mushrooms. The mushrooms were seasoned really well and not cooked to hell. Very nice. Duck fat fries were done really nicely, so crisp and not greasy at all. Seasoned very well too. The one that really called out to me was the corn. When it first arrived at the table, it didn't look great. It just looked like a soupy corn slaw with some popcorn on top. But let me tell you.. this was the highlight of my whole night. Some would think, well shouldn't it have been the porterhouse? No. You expect a steak to be delicious. And while you expect corn to be delicious as well, this was something else.. if you are so lucky to be able to try the creamed corn, order it. Their menu changes every day so, here's to hoping!

For dessert, we had the crème brule. Excellent. Sugar crust was nice and thin, and good vanilla beans used. Nice assortment of fresh fruits on top, served with biscotti. This was really nice.

Service - The hostess was great, greeted us at the front and took us to our seats. Our server was awesome! I only regret, I cannot remember his name. He took very good care of us, and was super informative. He took the time to go through the menu with us, and explain their dry aging process. He gave us good recommendations for wine as well. A+! Also, throughout dinner, various people came around to make sure our water glasses were never empty, and also wiped the crumbs off of the table. 

Overall - This place it really good if you're celebrating something, or just in the mood to have a really nice steak dinner. The portions are pretty big (maybe I'm just getting weaker with age), but I think steaks can be shared. The cost per person was around $160 after tax and tip, but we ordered apps and dessert and wine. So I think for a really great meal and really great service, it was worth it."}
{"text":"Complaints:

The waiter was not well trained, he used his palm on occasion as a lid for the water jug. 
Just gross. Apart from that the service was OK. Not perfect, so just staring at the waiter eye to eye is not enough to get their attention, but hey, this is Canada, service is bad here on average.

The steaks and potatoes au gratin had no taste to them. Really bland. My aunt is a chef, and I can 100% testify that Jacobs' potatoes au gratin blows, I had way better at home every time.

Duck fat fries tasted bad too. 


Considering that steaks are their specialty, and even a $10 steak from Quinn's steakhouse tastes better... well, I will not be back. 

Disclaimer:
This is my personal experience, my buddies liked their steaks more than I did. :)
We were unanimous on the potatoes/fries though."}
{"text":"Just get the caesar salad. Seriously. Jacob's ambiance is a bit too stuffy for my tastes, but the food sure as heck isn't. We left emminently Saturday satisfied."}
{"text":"Jacob's & Co Steakhouse is considered one of the best steakhouses in Toronto and last year I had the pleasure of dining at this highly raved restaurant. Although the menu has changed within the past year, I wanted to share my experience and personal opinions. The appetizers we ordered are still on the menu and I have provided the description and price below. As for the mains and side dish, I was unable to find the exact dish/description on the menu.

The interior of this restaurant was very modern and spacious. The bar area was on the main floor and the eating area was located upstairs. After ordering from the menu, we were given freshly baked Yorkshire Pudding to start off with. For starters, we ordered the Beef Tartar ($24) and Jacobs Caesar Salad ($18) which was prepared table side. The appetizers were presented really nice and clean, and portion sizes were big enough for two people to share. The Beef Tartar was perfectly seasoned, enhancing the flavours of the beef. The Caesar salad was very delicious and probably the best Caesar salad we've ever tasted!

After our appetizers, we were given a variety of different sauces and salts to try with our steaks. We ordered a Ribeye and a Wagyu California cut striploin. I don't recall how the ribeye tasted, but as for the Wagyu striploin, it was superb! The thin layers of fat within the steak brought out incredible flavours, making you chew slowly to enjoy every bite! We didn't need to use any of the sauces/salts because the steaks itself were flavoured enough. I don't remember the exact prices, but the Ribeye was around $55+ and the Wagyu striploin was a lot more expensive around $90+. For our side we ordered a hash brown dish (no longer on their menu) which we couldn't finish because it was quite heavy. It tasted really good, but we wished we had gone with a vegetable to balance out our steak. After paying the bill, we were given two muffins packaged nicely to take home. Great way to end our delicious dinner!"}
{"text":"Jacobs serves a good steak. I've been here a few times, and here are a few points to ponder....

1. The steaks are served hot and juicy. They are very good, but can at times be too salty. For 58$ and up, they ought to be good. If you have eaten much steak before, you will not eat the best steak you ever had here. That is, unless you are trying to console yourself for spending so much money OR if someone else pick up the check.
2. The sides are good, but do not stand out. They generally serve two people, but some, such as the average mashed potatoes, can be stretched much further.
3. The appetizers are better than the sides. Try the tuna app, as it is a contrast to a steak and a generous portion.
4. The service is sterile and average. If you like watching someone chop up a Caesar salad table side for 10 minutes rather than talking to others at your table, Jacob's has a few gimmicks like that. Otherwise, expect a mixed bag of service.
5. If you have a special occasion and want to bring in an outside cake, Jacob's charges 5$ per person extra.
6. Jacob's does not split checks. On my last visit, my party of 7 individuals had to calculate our own individual payments from one 1,000$+ check. We were then continually rushed as we tried to calculate. The server was rude about this, insisting that their system did not have a way of separating checks. It would seem that Jacobs could afford a better system. 

Conclusion: Go here if you have a very, very special occasion with a high maintenance special someone who demands lots of money be spent OR if your company has a bottomless corporate expense account. Otherwise, you may find Jacobs to be an overpriced decent steakhouse. 

If this is one if the highest rated places in Toronto, it says a lot about Toronto's need for improvement at the top end of its restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely amazing -except the wine prices...  Food and service was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place when I took my girlfriend here for her birthday. First off, the exterior is very nondescript, and with the snow starting to pile up, it was bit harder than expected to find. Once inside though, the decor was modern and nice.

It being my first time here, and knowing the cost, I was expecting a more intimate, fine dining experience, but that was definitely not the case. There were several tables of business professionals, some actually just having a meeting over dinner. The atmosphere was much louder than I expected, especially with a very obnoxious table behind us. I could barely hear my girlfriend across the table while speaking normally. Another table beside us made a comment to a manager but nothing was done as far as I could tell. This was a bit of a bummer, but got better when they quieted down to eat.

Onto the food, we ordered the Caesar salad, a side of Potatoes, half-order of mushrooms and for the meats, a 60-day aged 18 oz PEI bone-in striploin and a 4 oz cut of A5 Black Tajima-Hokkaido striploin. This was plenty for the two of us. The PEI striploin was great, and the A5 AMAZING. I wish I could have afforded more. The bread they give in the beginning was really good.The sides were just alright; the fries nothing particularly special. The Caesar salad prepared table side was fun, and tasty.

It was for a birthday, so in the end they brought out a candle-lit plate with 2 pieces of chocolate, which was nice. And there are the muffins that came with the bill.

Altogether the bill was around $385, which was quite steep (for me). The service was friendly and attentive, and our waiter explained a bit about the meats and the aging process in the beginning. The food was good: some things amazing, some just okay. But overall, the whole experience didn't leave me convinced that it was good enough to justify the cost. Maybe more of a 3.5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend to celebrate his Birthday.  I wouldn't go here unless it was a special occasion.  Set back two men $350 (with generous tip).

We got the 25oz t-bone steaks (each) which were a good size for some hungry males (rib eye from memory).  Perhaps the ladies would prefer a smaller size steak.. they are big.

The steaks were great.   Very tender, very delicious.  Unique, and I've eaten a lot of steaks in my life thus far...  the best?  Hmm.. not sure.  Was it worth it's price?  No.

We also got the duck fat fries, but I wouldn't say they were anything special at all.  Just a duck fat after taste on the fries.  Not bad, not great.

The Caesar salads (minus bacon for us out of preference) had a very flavourful, strong, pepperly dressing.  They dump a lot of pepper in the salad I think to spice it up.  It tastes good.  Get the Caesar salad :)

While I'm not a dessert person, I do encourage trying the deserts just because you are at Jacobs.  They are very good.  

We got the lemon tart, and some sort of doughey cake dripped in caramel that was really good.  Very gooey, about 50% sugar I  think in the dough, but divine (and i dont have a sweet tooth).  This item is off the menu on their website now, and I forget the name of it, but it was worth it.

I'd recommend everything we got, except the fries, contrary to the opinion of other reviews here.  Honestly, they just taste like normal fries with a richer fattier aftertaste on the fries (not so wonderful).

Go on a special occasion to Jacobs, but it's not good value for money in my opinion.  Stick to the Keg or Reds or something a little cheaper for a meal almost as good :)"}
{"text":"Oh my my!!
The best steakhouse award goes to \" Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse\". Located near King st and Brant intersection. I little difficult to locate. You might pass by and don't recognize that you just missed it. It's just next to Early Mercy on King. We went there for our anniversary dinner.

Once you go inside you get to see how classy it gets. Live music on Piano and all rich people. You need to save money for months to eat here because its EXPENSIVE and you don't want to come here and order a $100 steak you would want to spend more after looking at the huge choice of their steaks.

We started with their famous caesar salad and they make it fresh on your table, even the dressing they make it right in front of you from the scratch. It was good, WAYYYY TOOOO GOODDDD!!

For the mains my husband ordered the Wagyu steak, of course medium rare and I ordered Mushroom Risotto with a side of Potato Gratin. Everything was mindblowing.

They gave us complimentary chocolates and chocolate chip muffins for breakfast next morning. We had it next day and they were amazing too like everything else in their restaurant.

GOD!!We are a fan. We have to save a lot of money to visit them again and not eat out for months....lol ;)"}
{"text":"It really is the best steakhouse in Toronto!

My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate our anniversary,  and we were very impressed by everything from the moment we entered the door till the moment we left. 

We opted for valet parking for 20 + tip only because it was a special evening, it had snowed the day before and I was wearing heels. We usually park at a Green P parking and just walk. 

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess and showed us to our seats. The waiter gave us our menu, I like that the waiters were very informative about each cuts, he talked about the location from where the cuts came from to what type of taste and texture we would expect from the various types of steaks. Being first timers, they were very good and honest with their recommendations. We finally ordered the side table Caesar salad, Duck fat fries, 25 Oz. T-bone steak and 4oz Okinawa Wagyu steak. We were first served 2 huge popovers with tarragon butter and mmmmmm was it ever so GOOD!  I love watching my Caesar salad made at the table and it tasted great!! The duck fat fries were Ok, it was nice and crispy but I didn't care much for it. Before the steaks came, they gave us a 6 types of steak toppers: 3 different types of sea salt all imported from the same country (I forgot where and the specific names). The darkest one is  charcoal black, the other was smoked, and the white one is plain sea salt. The other three toppers were a bacon smoked cheese, a green Chimichurri sauce and Ponzu sauce. I particularly like the smoked bacon cheese, and the Black Charcoal sea salt. So our steaks finally came and I really appreciate that they have uniformly cut the steaks for us to share. First of all the Wagyu steak was to die for! It was very soft, flavourful and best of all it had a sweet after taste. The t-bone was really juicy and flavourful especially lightly sprinkled with the smoked sea salt. 

For Dessert we had the creme brûlée and it was creamy and not too sweet, simple and done right. After we got the bill, they gave us  two small chocolates and take home muffins, I believe they were chocolate chip muffins and my oh my was it amazing the next day!! While we were finishing up our wine, the server asked us if we would like our car to be started to warm up since it was -20 that afternoon! That just took an already amazing service to the next level!! We really enjoyed dining at Jacobs, I can't wait till I go back next time!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best service and food! Courtney was our waitress and she went above and beyond. I have celiacs and she made sure everything was perfect."}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouses in Toronto. We went there for my boyfriend's birthday and we weren't disappointed by the food or service. I especially loved the bone marrows and duck fat fries. trying the ceaser salad is also a must ( the best I had in town). The steaks are obviously all good. I got the A5 and I was pretty happy with it. the only thing thing I don't like about this place is the atmosphere. it's kind of filled with pretentious people who can barely afford to pay but act like kings. our next table was a group of drunk men in suits and I wanted to punch them in the face from the second we arrived. I don't suggest going here for an special occasion cause you'll definitely get annoyed by people but the food is just great."}
{"text":"This is a great steakhouse to visit when in Toronto. I ended up having a filet and it was good. As tempted as I was to order the Kobe Steak the waiters description of white uncooked meet turned me off a bit...and it is 1020.00. Outside of Tokyo it is hard to find a 1000+ steak. Someone please eat this and let me know how it goes. This is a good steakhouse but I am not sure it deserves the reputation it has. I would have to go again. There were defiantly some potential movie stars there, or at least they sounded like it.  I went with my boss from the UK, I am pretty sure my waiter had a fake British accent:) But still 4 stars this is a good place."}
{"text":"The steaks here hands down are the best I have experienced in Toronto, having living there for ~10 years, and ranks among the better steakhouse in California, Texas and Oklahoma.  The menu is quite pricy, but certainly a great value.  Service is great, sides are great, and the steaks were awesome.  The wine, cheese and aperitif list was also excellent."}
{"text":"Three visits, two were 5 star and 1 was terrible.  Terrible to the point our complete bill was taken care of by management.   The one anomaly was 100% service based.   

Jacobs excels at what it sets out to do, which is be a top class Steak house.  The restaurant itself is beautiful.  It exudes class though clean lines, cream and earth-tone decor.   The tables are oddly long so you feel as though you are sitting quite far from your dinner companion.  

Food; it is a steakhouse so there you go.   We have had 4 different cuts and our favourite was the 60 day aged bone in striploin.   Everyone loves their ceasar salad, I find it just a good salad to be honest.  Their popovers are as good as everyone says.   

This is an expensive restaurant and one couple should expect to spend a minimum of $400"}
{"text":"The yelp reviews don't do this place justice. Steaks are incredible, service is incredible, the restaurant facilities are so comfortable and you just feel like a better person after eating here. Watch out, this place will make a healthy dent in your wallet. I like how the restaurant also has spaces for fancy/romantic dinners and other spaces for casual drinks/hang outs. Make sure to make reservations well in advance."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5
Service: 4/5
Location: 4/5
Highlight: The tableside preparation of the Caesar Salad got me excited, and the breakfast muffin parting-gift was a nice touch. I was a little disappointed since the steak didn't really blow me away. It was a bit cold when it arrived at the table. 

I came here for a date night with my boyfriend. The restaurant set-up was beautiful, with different rooms and areas with slightly different décor and setup. We were seated in a more private room that was dimly lit and quiet, whereas the outer area had more brightly-lit big tables for larger groups and a bar area. 
 
Their cheese bread with herb-whipped butter - BOMB.COM. My Jacob's Caesar Salad was prepared tableside, which was a nice touch since I was able to see what they were putting into it. Everybody on Yelp was really hyping up this salad so I was expecting some life-changing leaves. The salad was good, but not great. The thick cut bacon was heavenly and the Tabasco gave it a subtle kick, but it's not a salad I would pay $20 again for. In theory the duck fat French fried potatoes are right up my alley, but in reality, the results were a too salty for my tastes. They were nice to dip into the steak dips, but what does it take for a girl to get some ketchup around here.

 I ordered a California Cut Striploin aged 55 days (medium) and the man went all in for the 90 days aged Striploin (medium rare). The 40 extra days of aging that Henry's striploin had over my steak actually made a huge difference. It was much more tender and juicy, with a greater depth of flavour. I'd recommend going as old as you can afford. 

Our server came out with a plate of dipping salts, and another plate with various sauces. With the steak already well seasoned, dipping it in more salts felt like overkill. In addition to the fries, a lot of salt was going on. Of all the dipping options my favourites were the Hawaiian charcoal infused salt, the Argentinian green chili sauce, and the creamy Danish blue cheese spread. 

The hostesses and wait staff were very polite and highly attentive which is obviously a plus, but at times it was to the point where it made me a little uncomfortable. I know it's a personal preference, but the very formal atmosphere felt stiff and detracted from me being able to enjoy myself. I cracked a bacon joke to the man making my salad and I got nothin'. It is definitely great place for business dinners and fancy special occasions. A good date night restaurant if you're trying to impress (aka. First dates)."}
{"text":"My favourite splurge dinner spot. Steaks are always great. Table side Caesar is a hit or miss depending on the server who makes it. Beef tartare is amazing but has quite a strong truffle oil flavor."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite restaurant in Toronto. Yes it is a bit pricey, but in this case you get what you pay for. Service is fantastic , the waiters are all incredibly attentive, unpretentious and knowledgable about the menu and different kinds of steak. 
The food is amazing, I have been here about 6 times now and have never been disappointed. The popovers to start melt in your mouth. The Caesar salad is made table side and is the best. The steaks are cooked to perfection. They come with 3 different kinds of salt and 3 different sauces that are delicious. Highly recommend the oysters Rockefeller, it is fabulous. Tip- you can order half sizes of many of the sides.. Definitely will keep coming back, this place is AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot for a celebration and for any time that you're looking for a special culinary experience. The food here is incredible and the servers are academic in their knowledge of what they're selling. Our server gave us an engaging and informative ten minute talk through the menu, which was exciting and educational and set the stage perfectly for the meal. We enjoyed a tenderloin from PEI, a ribeye from Guelph, and a California striploin from Westholme farms in Australia. Each steak was beautifully cooked and full of flavour. The tenderloin was a standout value for the price, the ribeye was unique in its minerality, and the striploin was like no other steak I've had in my life - like butter. Amazing. For sides we had the Cesar salad (yummmmmm and prepared table side with the best Parmesan, croutons, and bacon of all time), mushrooms, Brussels sprouts, and tomatoes. All sides were excellent except the tomatoes, which were just okay. The meal started with warm and delicious popovers, and we capped it off with the monkey bread (upscale Cinnabon and the ultimate comfort food turned decadent dessert) and ice cream. Wines and drinks were awesome too. Service was top notch, and they are eager to please with custom cuts and modifications. Highly highly highly recommended!! Probably the best dining experience I've had in the last few years. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse I've been too.  The food is more than amazing.  Soooo many steak options. The servers are great especially our server Trevor.   The ambiance is great.   There are so many seatings room that fit everything from business dinners to romantic dates.  Great night overall."}
{"text":"5 Stars for attentive service.  An older gent smoking outside (oddly enough) opens the door for my sister and I as he welcomes us to Jacob & Co. Steakhouse.  After taking a somewhat unnerving walk down the stairs, we sat at the bar since we did not have a reservation on a Saturday evening at 6:30 p.m.  Full points for our server, who was working the bar as well, for her knowledge and communication of their menu and the wine list: very thorough rundown of the choices of steaks and what to expect from each choice paired with her willingness to find us a bottle of decent red in double digits (most wines on their list cost triple, quadruple digits).  

1 Star for being wayyyy too dark.  Once you enter the restaurant, you have to let your eyes adjust to the dim interior before taking the sweeping stairs down to the restaurant level.  This could potentially be very dangerous for someone on heels wearing sunglasses which one of us was.  :p

0 Star for not being able to accommodate little ones.  No high chairs in sight although I did not ask and no place to change your little one as the washrooms are very quaint and of course, without a change table.  I guess not too many parents take their babies/toddlers to a high end steak houses?

3.5 Stars for food:  We ordered hamachi crudo appy to share, an 12 oz organic ribeye (medium), 8 oz striploin, half order of pureed potatoes, broccolini in cheese sauce and monkey bread with cream cheese dip for dessert. 

Hamachi crudo was 5 flash-seared pieces of buttery fish sitting atop a thin layer of teriyaki sauce and topped with crushed macadamia nuts.  The fish was served with brown salt scattered on the plate alongside a small mound of condiment.  Nicely executed dish although I did not care for the teriyaki sauce.  

The Striploin was cut very thick (good 2+ inches) and came out closer to medium rare on a cast iron plate which cooked the steak a little more as we ate it which was fine for this order.  The meat had great flavour and just toothsome enough for my liking.  However, our ribeye arrived overdone and as we ate, the steak became closer to a well-done than a medium which was not so great.  Nothing worse than eating an over-cooked steak that costs $55.  The ribeye was surprisingly tough even for the level of doneness albeit having pretty great flavour.  The meat was served with trio of salt (volcanic lava, some english white and french pink?) and trio of sauces (yuzu, chimichurri and bacon and blue cheese?).  I prefer my steaks with the lava and pink salt as they add more briny saltiness than in your face punchy saltiness.  Yuzu & bacon blue cheese spread thingy were a fail for me but the chimichurri was a real hit as it added a nice brightness to the steak.  

The pureed potato was your usual variety but it was nice that the kitchen accommodates half orders as a full one would have been way too much.  The broccolini in a cheese sauce topped with gremolata boosted this side to a whole new level with the flavours in the gremolata adding nice lemony green taste to the cheese sauce.  

The monkey bread with the cream cheese dip was just ok.  I could probably whip that up at home without much problem, except when I do decide to do that, I will use a lot less sugar.  It was uber sweet and eating it made my teeth hurt.  Enough said.  

After our meal, our server brought us complimentary glasses of dessert wine to make up for the overdone ribeye which was a nice gesture.  It's just that I am not a huge fan of sweet dessert wines.

To finish off the meal, they brought out the complimentary white chocolate truffles topped with fresh raspberry and chocolate chip muffins for us to take home.  No, we did not receive any special treatment as they were doing this for every guest.  Definitely a nice show of appreciation on the restaurant's part.  

With a $80 bottle of Pinot Noir, our bill (including a pretty generous tip) came to $300.  Although our dining experience in its entirety was pleasant, I am not sure if I would go out of my way to dine at Jacob & Co. Steakhouse again as I am pretty sure next time I visit, I will have my toddler in arms.

Oh, the live piano was a nice touch as well."}
{"text":"Great steak, amazing service & atmosphere.  Had the Caesar , 70 day aged steak, duck fat fries, and corn special.  All dishes we delicious.  Service is so attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly.  

Great place if you want a treat.  Also probably a good place to take a client"}
{"text":"No point making a note of the cost in this. It's not about compromises on quality or cost in here. The food is where is should be for this level of a restaurant. 

We sat down stairs next to the bar. Which I must say was worth it. Live music (piano) being played on the side. 

Attentive service. $20 valet if you'd like. They call them to bring your car out just before you leave. 

Had a whole row of oysters and jumbo shrimp along with Beef Tartare for the appetizers. That sea food was so fresh. Delicious. The beef Tartare though. Was the best I've ever had. By far. 

Comes down to the steak. Tried the Snake River wagyu ribeye for myself and did get a chance to try a few others as well. I'll admit that ribeye melted. It was unreal. Also I'm officially spoiled for steaks and oysters now. Lesser options may not suffice!"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for our one year anniversary. 
First impression - it's located in a random side street, which seemed strange. 
Second impression - there were only luxury cars in the parking lot (**sigh of relief we didn't drive). 
Everything went smoothly from the moment we stepped inside until the moment we left (except for, perhaps, the reality of facing/paying the bill). 
I ordered a spicy Caesar drink after debating its cost (~$20) for about 10 minutes. Definitely worth it. By far the best Caesar I've ever had. And the alcohol might have numbed a bit of the shock of the price. 
There was something about their cheese popovers and garlic butter that immediately won me over. It had a nice crunch on the crust, but the inside was so soft and fluffy. I would have been content to leave after finishing that bread.
We ordered the Caesar salad as an appetizer. It was made table side - I had never even heard of that until I witnessed it at Jacobs. You can really taste the difference in quality - yes, of a salad. They even have these special tables specifically for the making of their famous Caesar salads. 
We both had steaks (can't go to a steakhouse and get anything other than a steak..!). I don't remember what we ordered specifically as I'm not well educated in steaks, but our server was very helpful in explaining the differences between the many steaks available to choose from. I'm not sure if it was the knife, meat, or both, but the steaks were so easy to cut and so very tender. There's a reason Jacobs is arguably the best steakhouse in Toronto. Oh that's right, their steaks are the best. 
Our server brought out three sauces and three salts as seasoning - a little overkill in my opinion, but definitely reinforces the high class atmosphere of Jacobs. We tried them all just for the sake of trying them, but didn't really end up using any. I just used the garlic butter from the popovers. 
We also ordered a couple of side dishes - duck fat fries and mushrooms. Jacobs has the option of half portion sides, which allows you to try more items off the menu. These were pretty good, but it was still a lot of food for two people and we ended up taking home a good amount of leftovers. 
Lastly, we ordered a creme brûlée to share. It was a lighter dessert to end the meal on. Nothing special, but definitely still a tasty treat. 
When we asked for the bill, our server brought out two bite sized desserts (a cookie and biscotti) as well as individually packaged muffins for breakfast the next day. These little things really added to the experience. 

Overall, it was an amazing way to celebrate a special occasion. Not something I'd do often, but everyone should treat themselves occasionally. I give it 4/5 stars because it is still rather pricey. Cost will be around $100 per person. If you're looking to treat yourself but also be (semi) conservative on spending, I would suggest ordering a larger steak to share, along with some side dishes. Perhaps creating a Jacobs savings account well in advance."}
{"text":"Manage your expectations here. This isn't a Ruth's Chris, this is something much greater. Expect to spend a lot of money, and leave wondering how you will ever be able to eat steak again, because it will only go down from here."}
{"text":"I have been going to Jacobs & Company for several years now and I am always amazed by the service I receive.
I dine here regularly with a friend and we are always given the same waiter who remembers the details of what we like as well as our names.
The food is some of the best in the country. I once splurged and ordered Kobe beef steak ($420) and it was the most heavenly piece of meat I have ever tasted, though I also find their other cuts to be top notch.
The wine list is vast and full of amazing reds at decent prices.
Overall, I find Jacobs & Co to be a world class dining experience for those that like luxury.
LADIES: Be aware that there are a lot of stairs within the restaurant so wearing difficult to walk in stilletos might be a challenge."}
{"text":"Great steakhouse, I eat here as often as I can.  Always a great selection of steaks sourced from all over, including many places I would not expect.  Unbelievable wine list and very knowledgable servers.  The table side caeser salad reminds me of going to the Blackhawks in Chicago or delmonicos with my parents.  

Definitely try the duck fat fries, incredible.  One time I did have a very tough steak it was replaced with a wagu of the same cut and they didn't charge me the very significant difference in price.  

Best if you are on an expense account but worth every cent.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. Loved it! Everyone was super courteous (guess that's what you get for the price they charge). Ordered a drink and had to turn it back because wasn't what I had imagined, they were more than happy to replace my drink. Highly recommend ceasar salad, loved the process of watching the server making it next to us. I didn't go crazy about the duck fat fries, my husband said he enjoyed them. The steaks were yummy! Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"i am giving it 4 stars for an amazing caesar salad, amazing service and delicious muffins for the next morning!"}
{"text":"First things first, it is worth the steak education there - but you would definitely need to know what you want to order. 

The steak plate they bring out at the beginning of the dinner is awesome - because your waiter takes you through the different types of beef they have in the ageing room. I noticed that their beef menu can changed day by day. 

But if you see a ribeye on offer from the Black Angus in the US, I definitely recommend it. We, also, ordered two more locally raised steaks, like a bone in striploin and a porterhouse was solid - but the black Angus had the best flavour (more buttery fat flavour). The porterhouse was ok, but I found the bone-in striploin had a bit more of a grassy aftertaste, similar to lamb. 

But the server did warn us - as they are very well informed as to the diet and origin of the cattle you are ordering to ingest that evening.

The Ceasar salad is made table side - which is a nice show - but I think depending on who makes the salad - it may be a hit or miss. In our case, the maker over did it on the pepper and Worcester sauce.

Lobster Cobb was beautifully presented  and there is quite a bit of Lobster in it and it tasted nice and creamy from the avocado in the salad. 

Sides - we ordered the mushrooms, stuffed baked potato, asparagus and a 1/2 portion of the foie gras poutine. They are good for sharing - but other than the stuffed baked potato, they didn't make much of an impression as must order. Most of the sides are avaliable in 1/2 portions minus the stuffed baked potato.  

For a special celebration - you should get wowed by the impressive service. But ask them to seat you in the piano bar lounge area - much quieter than the dining area.

 Because we decided to go family style with the steaks and sides - we didn't get a chance to try dessert - but they have an petit fours plate they give you plus \"breakfast\" afterwards. 

Wine is pricey - $15 and up per glass, but the wine list is solid. I ordered a Pinot noir from Italy and it was good to sip through the entire night - I ordered the 6 oz. glass. The beer is much more reasonably priced. 

Overall - not the best steak I've ever had - but a solid choice - but let's be honest here - you really are paying for the outstanding  service at these prices and the cache of being a \"high roller\". 

5 yelp stars on service and 3 yelp stars for food - so outcome is 4 yelp stars."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Excellent service.  

High end steakhouse with a wide selection of Wagyu, Japanese and other steaks.  The Wagyu steak was melt-in-your-mouth delicious =9  Overall, their menu selection (not just in steaks) goes beyond that of a traditional steakhouse.  Garlic Popovers!!  Delicious side dishes (in particular, their Duck Fat Fries, Potato Gratin, and Mushrooms).  Free Mocha Muffins for Day-After Breakfast!  

Service was fantastic - multiple waiters who were all very attentive and courteous.  

Good place for business and special occasions."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant was excellent. From the food (best steaks in Toronto!), the friendly & extremely professional staff, and the warm ambiance. Make sure to splurge on the Wagyu steaks (you won't be disappointed)."}
{"text":"Guys, this is THE PLACE in Toronto, trust me. I dont know where to start. I was amazed about the experience. From the drinks before dinner to the espressos after. The touch of getting your caesar salad prepared table side, and with all fresh ingredients, is amazing. The only reason for the 4 stars is the beef. I ordered a Kobe grade beef (is like Kobe but from a different city in Japan). I am a big Kobe consumer just to know the amount of fat in a Kobe beef is higher than regular beef but mine was beyond what I know in Kobe, anyway, it was delicious though. Yes I know, it is a little bit on the expensive side, but is worth it, every penny. Definitively, THE PLACE in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love Jacobs.  Variety of different steaks and the perfect cooking is impressive.  Warmed plates, knowledgable servers and no rush.  Awesome.

Had Idaho wagu tenderloin - perfect tenderness.  Flavour awesome.  Great for sp coal occasions of meat lovers!"}
{"text":"Probably the best steakhouse in toronto right now, quality maybe on par with some others, but the presentation of salts and decor make it seem more than just a steak house and more like fine dining.  I also like the duck fat fries, very ducky flavoured."}
{"text":"After hearing so many great and wonderful things on Yelp, TripAdvisor, magazines, and numerous blogs, I decided to give Jacobs & Co a try for myself.  

Immediately, when you walk in through those wooden doors, you are greeted by friendly and professional servers who offer to check your coat and lead you to your table.  The seats are spacious and comfy and the dining area is impeccably clean.  

Our server was extremely knowledgable, explaining to us the aging process, the local availability, and how they can offer to pre-cut for sharing purposes.  He was extremely friendly as well.  I started off with a lovely glass of red from Greece, which throughout my meal, complimented so well with everything.  Here are the following items that is a MUST try: 

1) Jacobs Caesar Salad
Prepared table side, this is a must-have for starters.  I really wish there was more Tabasco in my salad but this is to no fault of the server (my mother doesn't take spicy).  Overall, the dressing was wonderful - maybe there could have been a bit more dressing.  

2) Wagyu - let your server decide which wagyu is the best for you because as I said, they are SO knowledgable.  We shared a slice of wagyu from Snake River Farms and it was so juicy and tender.  

3) Angus striploin - ah from city of my alma mater, Guelph.  I always drove by those farms and thought about how delicious those cute little things were (I'm joking by the way, don't call PETA).  But seriously, that slice of steak was DELICIOUS.  

4) If you decide to eat nothing but sides there (which you'd be very silly to do so), you DEFINITELY have to give this sweet potato dish a try.  I have never tasted anything so delicious in my life.  It was sweet and salty at the same time and I could...probably sit there and eat that dish exclusively until I died.  

The only complaint I have is the lack of cleanliness in the washrooms when I went that occasion.  It was just...really quite gross to go to an unclean washroom and a bit disappointing considering I was at a top tier restaurant.  Hopefully, they can improve on that . 

Overall, I would most definitely go again to this wonderful place.  It is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"We went as a large group and got the \"wine room\" as we were with some high profile people.  The staff was supper attentive of course.  The room had the Aged Beef hanging as well a wine, so we felt very special.  We started with Salad which was prepared with meticulous steps in a large bowl at our table side by a very sweet waitress.  We followed with large cuts of meat which were very expensive, even by Steakhouse standards, but of course they had a cut for every budget from $ to $$$$.  We chose to share a few of the more expensive cuts and get a taste of different ages.  They spend a great deal of time explaining Aged meat which was fun and interesting.  The sides were excellent and the dessert was awesome.  They send you home with a very delightful muffin which we all ate for breakfast.  I can't speak for the main room, but if you can get the wine room for a large party, it's a nice place for your large group.  We were visiting from Los Angeles."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! Impeccable service. You are made to feel very special here, and the service is down to earth and unpretentious. We were literally thanked by 20 people on the way out. The steak is delicious, the Caesar salad (made at your table according to your specifications), the mushrooms, asparagus, potatoes, and fries too. The chocolate cake was unbelievable. They made me a fruity drink that wasn't on the menu; it was tropically delicious. Loved it! One of the best dining experiences I've had in Toronto. We weren't rushed, and were given complementary muffins for breakfast, complimentary chocolate, and champagne as our friends were celebrating their anniversary."}
{"text":"Amazing steak!   I try to visit a steakhouse each place I travel and this one is near the top.   Definitely on the expensive side but worth a splurge if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Exceptional! The service was outstanding, the servers, assistants and even managers made sure you had EVERYTHING you needed or cleared off your table the valet guy deserves a shout out as well. 
We had the seafood tower which I HIGHLY recommend, the shrimp, scallop salad, mussels, lobster, crab salad, oysters were unreal and paired with delicious sauces, the duck fat fries were good (although I probably wouldn't order again for the price/ and at this type of venue), the buns they serve you are a cross breed between a Yorkshire pudding and roll it was like heaven, the A5 Black Tajima-Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan Tenderloin was UNREAL and the various salts paired with it made every bite an experience (they offer to slice if for you to make it easier for sharing), the Caesar salad was probably the only disappointing part (I could taste the preservatives they use on the lettuce, similar to a 'bagged salad' although our assistant making the salad was really charming. Definitely a place to impress and enjoy the entire dining experience!"}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in Toronto! Came here in April with the whole family for dad's bday and it certainly made his day! We tried all sorts of steaks including some wagyu, and the quality and taste were incredible! We also ordered the Caesar salad prepared table-side, and dad who does not eat salads was licking the dressing! Everything was delicious, and for dessert we had the newly added 12-layer chocolate cake ... simply amazing! The service was a little slow at first but very attentive as dinner progressed. Their wine list also satisfied our needs. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"I should start by saying I came here with high expectations based on their yelp score. Upon arrival we were greeted properly and guided to our table. I was meeting a group of 12 so we were quite big. The place was nice. The first letdown was when the waitress told us she can only give us one bill and we have to split it ourselves. I found that unacceptable. Why should I do your work? The service started nicely. We got our drinks. Some of us had wine bottles which the server opened and after half an hour she came back and told my friend she will have to charge us for our wine. I mean that's probably fair but the way it was executed it felt like a bait and switch. Next I asked her for another beer. She told me she would come back in a minute. She didn't come back. Next another waitress came and asked us how we wanted our Caesar salad. We were surprised because we had not ordered salad but we thought it came with the food anyway so we gave her our instructions and when she finished the salads she realized they were for other ppl and she just handed them the salads without even asking if they were ok with the ingredients. I should also mention we did not change seats! Next when I was ordering the waitress told me my tbone would be extra juicy because of the higher fat tissue in the meet I was ordering. When the steak arrived it was actually quite dry and on top of that my knife was not sharp and could hardly cut through the meet. 
I wish I had the experience that other people had here but I didn't. I most likely won't go here again or at least in a large group."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary dinner. Make sure you wear comfortable heels here because it can be a bit of a trek to get to your table. You have to make it up a couple of stairs to get into the restaurant then you have to walk down a flight more to get to the hostess and since we were seated in the main dining hall upstairs we had to walk through the lower dining room and up another flight of stairs to our table. The decor is beautiful and the mood is amazing. The staff were well informed and were able to give suggestions and advice on which cuts to choose depending on your tastes. 

We finally decided to go with the USDA Prime Black Angus Aged 60 days Striploin and Ribeye. We also got a half side of the braised red cabbage and the duck fat fries since everyone else raved so much about them. We thoroughly enjoyed the braised red cabbage, probably because of the fragrance of the apple bacon. Personally, I didn't find the duck fat fries to be anything special and regretted not choosing the caesar salad spectacle instead.  

We enjoyed the steaks the most, this was our first experience with aged steak and we really were able to taste the difference! We opted for both our steaks to come carved. It was particularly nice that they served a side of sauces and salts so you're able to mix and match and find your favourite combination. Our favourite, hands down, was the rib eye. It melted in our mouths and it was so absolutely tender. The striploin was great as well but it seemed dry in comparison to how tender and soft the rib eye was. 

By the end of everything we were stuffed, we barely finished our half sides and unfortunately had no room for dessert but the good part is they send you home with little chocolate chip muffins.

Overall, you definitely get what you pay for here. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Jacobs and haven't find a steakhouse that compares. Would definitely come back for a special occasion as it can be a bit tough for the wallet."}
{"text":"My first time ever eating steak in a restaurant...and of COURSE, I had to be spoiled by Jacobs & Co!

Service: amaaaaaazing. Our server, Henry, was really personable, down to earth, and attentive. There was this lady with a cute smile who made the Caesar salad and explained the salts/sauces..she was great. Everyone there worked together perfectly. The hostess stand and management were amazing as well. I can't say enough good things about their service.

We tried:
- White cheddar cheese popovers with roasted garlic & oregano butter: this is the amazing bread that comes out. I usu don't like bread and def do not eat butter, but the two together were just melt in your mouth delicious.
- 6 oz tenderloin (Canadian prime Hereford-Lindsay, ON): I know I'm crazy, but I don't like raw meat, so I had mine well-done, and it wasn't dry at all.. it was amaaaazing.
- 10 oz california cut (Snake River Farms Wagyu from Idaho, USA): reeeeally good!!
- Caesar salad: love how it's made tableside! 1 order is def enough for 2 people. The dressing isn't too creamy, and there's a perfect amt of dressing to lettuce. I also appreciate how mine didn't come covered w/cheese, and they added bacon & extra croutons per my fried food & carb lovin' request.
- Asparagus: came w/this hollaindaise sauce.. it was really good! Next time though, I'll prolly skip the asparagus so I can try other veggies.
- Potato puree: creamy mashed potatoes, we ordered a 1/2 portion!
- Duck fat french fried potatoes: sooooooo...goooooood. I think they're double fried? Who knows, but they're a gift from God.

A+ food, service, and ambiance!! (And they even give you muffins to take home!)"}
{"text":"I love coming here - it's my favourite steakhouse! My most recent visit was the other night with 6 other friends. As usual, Jacobs was busy and there wasn't an empty table in sight. Reservations are highly recommended - regardless of whether it's for two people or a group since people love dining here. Reservations can be booked through the OpenTable website but any group larger than 4 requires a call to the restaurant. In our case, I booked a few weeks ago for our group dinner the other night.

Their complimentary homemade bread (popovers) with the herb butter is a great start to the meal here. They're soft on the outside and airy on the inside. So good!

There are many appetizers and sides to choose from such as their famous ceasar salad that's made table side (never ordered this because salad is salad to me lol but apparently it's good), oysters rockefeller, potato gratin, mushrooms, etc for under $20. We love the duck fat frites here so I'd recommend getting that.

They have a great selection of high quality steaks from around Canada, U.S., Japan to name a few. You can get a delicious one for under $80 and of course, there are higher end steaks for those willing to spend. I got an 8 oz tenderloin from PEI and my husband got a 12 oz corn fed striploin from Kansas on this particular occasion. I like my steak well done and it's always flavourful, melts in my mouth and never dry or chewy here. Mmm! Everyone loved their steaks and all were done to their liking.

I never get around to dessert here since I'm always too full after having steak but they have many good choices for under $15. They also give complimentary chocolate chip muffins when it's time to go, which is a nice touch.

Service here is amazing - from hostesses upon entering, actual servers at the table, staff walking you to the washroom if you're not sure where to go, etc. They also aren't snobby and pretentious from my experiences here - professional but friendly people. 

Always a fantastic experience here - that's why we and so many others keep coming back! Keep it up Jacobs & Co!!!"}
{"text":"If your looking for the best steak, with the most variety, Jacobs is the way to go! Their A5 is phenomenal! Fresh breakfast muffins for when you go home just make it that much better. This is a must!"}
{"text":"Not only is this the best steak dinner in the city but perhaps the greatest dining experience I've ever had.

When we arrived, they took our coats and both hosts said happy anniversary to us.  They took us to our seats, immediately brought us complimentary champagne and the THREE people waiting on us that night all said happy anniversary to us.

Our main server was a true gentlemen and easily took a good full 5 to 10 minutes explaining everything in the menu.  He made a point to say it would be best to order one steak and one or two sides to share but we were gluttonous fools on our anniversary so we ignored him.

We started with the best caesar salad I've ever had, made right at our table.  Even this guy said Happy Anniversary to us before telling us all the ingrediants he was adding.  $16 for a salad for the table, so the two of us shared what ended up being a big salad.

My fiancee ordered a really nice rib eye that she liked, I ordered the most expensive steak on the menu which was from a Japanese farm.  I've heard the expression \"this meat will melt in your mouth\" but until I had this steak, I've never before experienced this phenomenon.

Our sides were mushrooms (which there was tons left over), double cooked fries in duck fat and the steaks themselves came with various salts and dips.  The only thing we regretted ordering were the fries, not because they weren't good but we didn't really need them and they didn't blend with the flavours of everything else very well.

The combo of my steak, mushrooms and the rouqefort cheese they brought with the steak, was easily the greatest taste I've ever had in my mouth.

We managed dessert, my fiancee had their homemade ice cream which was unreal.  I had a cheese plate with whiskey soaked cheddar.  On its own I wasn't crazy about it but when I added the honey they brought with the cheese, it was heaven.

With drinks, a very generous tip and the most expensive steak on the menu, the bill was quite high (just shy of $400) but had we ordered as they suggested it would have been on par with a bill from Barberian's but this dinner and experience, as much as I love Barberian's, was sadly better than my best experience at Barberians by quite a margine.

The combo of the unreal food, very nice people, attentive service and slick looking restaurant, I've yet to have a better dining experience in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great coffee and great service. He worked hard and the coffee was worth his hard work!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant ambience with amazing food. It feels a little out of all the places where it's usually pretty noisy and has a very intimate theme every time I go there. Their staff is very welcoming, literally does make you feel like he/she is your personal concierge. 
Sometimes it may be difficult  to get a reservation but calling them may help as they show a little bit of flexibility.
Best part is if you order ahead they can arrange a HALAL steak for you which is very considerate of a place like this.
The filet mignon and caesar salad were stellar and the customer service was up to par."}
{"text":"Phenomenal meal and experience! It's pricey, but worth it. 

Our table of four first enjoyed the fluffy popovers that didn't even need the herbed butter that accompanied them. The table-side Caesar salad was scrumptious with large tasty pieces of bacon and Parmesan croutons. We also had the Bone Marrow served with a large Octopus tentacle which was pure heaven, although I personally found the octopus a bit over-done. We elected to share 3 steaks - a rib-eye from PEI, T-Bone from USA and a Kobe filet mignon from Japan, all cooked to perfection and carved for sharing. The spinach side had a touch too much butter, but the mash potato was divine. Our waiter talked us into the Monkey Bread which was terrific but far too sweet and rich not to be shared. 

The waiters were friendly, attentive and knowledgable but still recognized when to leave us to enjoy each others' company. 

I'd highly recommend this wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"4.5/5 out of 5 but let's round up. Hands down the absolute very best steakhouse in Toronto. Most interesting selections of beef from various farms I've seen from ANY steakhouse I've been to in North America. It is extremely expensive however. The steak menu gets adjusted almost daily and sometimes you can land on a day where there's no steaks below $80 aside from simple filets. They are 1 of maybe 10-12 restaurants in all North America that has a Kobe beef certificate. More than likely the restaurants you've been to in the past are not serving real Kobe beef (maybe wagyu but real Kobe is a higher grade and has its own certificate). The wine menu is very extensive and has rare bottles including DRC. very high mark up however around 3 to 3.5x which is VERY high. Overall decor is a little too contemporary for me but sitting upstairs is much better feel."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love Jacobs & co. The first time we came here I didn't make reservations but was lucky enough to get a table downstairs by the bar. The Cesar salad made table side is delicious, we get ours with extra garlic. We've been here a number of times so I can't remember which steaks we've tried....we try to order a different one each time just for variety, but regardless of what we get, in whatever price range, they were all amazing. They were so soft, juicy, and succulent. We also usually split the poutine which is really tasty, and that along with the salad and a steak for each of us is enough food. 

The service is great and atmosphere is really nice, this is def a place to take someone if you're looking to impress.

There's also a gentleman by the name of Phillip who works there, I'm assuming he's a host but I'm not sure. He's such a great addition to their team. He makes you feel like a regular even if it's your first time. On our first time there he found out it was our anniversary and comped a glass of (I think it was) champagne each. He made us feel like we were the most important people in there that night and every time we go, and it's because of the great impression he left that we'll remain loyal customers."}
{"text":"Harbour Sixty used to be the best steak in the city imo. Jacobs has now surpassed them in my mind. Ribeye is too delicious. Desserts are only ok but I come here for best steak in the city."}
{"text":"This place hit the spot in every possible way the ribeye was cooked to perfection every time I come to Toronto I will always come back to Jacobs. And the service was impeccable. I kinda felt like I was in ny just to put that in their."}
{"text":"Some of the best beef I have tasted
Over the top service 
The pricing is expensive (mainly around the steaks - the sides and appetizers are not super high for a top restaurant)
I loved the caesar salad and wanted extra cheese buns
overall A+"}
{"text":"After a lot of research for good steakhouses. I decided to take my boyfriends father here for his Bday. As the dine.TO rated them to be No.1 steakhouse in Toronto. I had to try it. Everyone who has been there told me it was very pricy. I found it fairly priced. Maybe because we don't each much meat. So we order the famous Ceasar Salad which you must get. The dressing is freshly made in front of you as the other reviews had already mentioned it. The Duck friends were so so...didn't really taste the difference with regular fries. We also had the Potato Gratin it was good but we found it rich maybe because we had the fries already. SO steak-wise we ordered the Canadian-prime Ribeye 14oz and a USDA Prime Black Ribeye 14oz chuck and a Wagyu California Cut. According to the waiter the chuck is a cut were the meat is a mix of texture because it is in between muscles so it had a little fat as well. I loved IT. The california cut came overcooked and the waiter apologized and removed it from our bill. The services was really good, the waiters knew their menu inside out and were able to explain us and give us good recommendations. And at last the bill came out to be very reasonable for the quality and the service. Just one note, I found the place a little bit to loud i was barely able to hear the waiter or my boyfriend beside me. OH also dont get fooled by the host and their lack of customer service. Once you are seated you will get all the attention."}
{"text":"This was a meal that was excellent from the beginning to the end. We started with fresh oysters in the half shell. From there we had a delicious Caesar Salad prepared at our table. We enjoyed a stuffed bake potato which was more than enough for two people in addition to a 6 oz tenderloin steak. It was tasty and accompanied by three sauces also cooked to perfection. At the end the meal we received a complimentary brownie which was moist and delicious. Which reminds me I forgot to mention the fresh baked popover we were served at the beginning of our meal. The service we received from Andrew and staff  was beyond reproach!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent but i am sad to say that the best part of my dining experience was the caesar salad they made for me. I was expecting so much more from the steaks i ordered at 200-300 per piece but was delivered with small, dry and unsatisfactory meat and the duck fries were soggy. Not recommended you go here for really expensive steak."}
{"text":"Very good service, staff very pleasant. Best Caesar salad I've tried, steak was phenomenal too."}
{"text":"4.5***/5

Visited Jacobs to celebrate a special occasion and was not disappointed at all. The entire service team, from the hostesses, to the bussers, to the waiter, were professional and prompt. The staff made sure that everything was perfect from start to finish. Small touches like complimentary champagne (as it was an anniversary dinner) and chocolate-chip muffins to take home elevate Jacobs above the rest.

In terms of the food, some items exceeded expectations while others were underwhelming. Caeser salad (prepared table-side) was very good. Duck fat fries, not very good (arrived a bit soggy). Tenderloin from Guelph, ON -- pretty average, could find similar at The Keg, or a lot better at Ruth's. USDA Prime Angus ribeye was very good. Wagyu striploin from Snake River Farms was very, very good. 

With a couple drinks, an appetizer, and a few steaks to share (especially kobe/wagyu), dinner for two can easily run upwards of $400-500. Expect, however, that your night will be almost perfect from start to finish. Would highly recommend for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday... absolutely amazing food and service!!! And amazing pianist!!!"}
{"text":"Love it. Never had any issues food is great. Service is amazing."}
{"text":"I'm sorry my bill came to how much?! 
I'm not a 'steak' person so it's hard for me to judge this place but come on - is this place really worth the hype?  I'm shocked that my fellow yelpers aren't bothered by their prices.  
YES the caesar salad is good... and YES the steak is good but not for $150!!

I think this place is a one of for me - I can`t afford this place (unless I end up here with my celebrity crush Johnny Depp :P   ) 

My girlfriends are I went here for our annual Christmas dinner. 
I ordered the homemade Caesar salad which was really good to be honest and make right infront of your eyes.  My heart did ping for a nicer quality of meat but my wallet said no. 
I had the simplest California Striploin.  For steak sure it was great.  I hate The Keg so maybe they have ruined `the art` of steak for me but I seriously can`t be a judge on a good cut of meat. 

As a side I shared the duck fat fries.  Don`t know what the hype is about those - I found them overdone.

To top it off the servers are stuck up and in the end when there were 8 of us - she couldn`t separate the bills.  So of course had to figure out what we all owened on our own and divide.  Seriously the amount of money you`re charging and you can`t even split a bill!

Now I understand it's probably because we're a party of 8 so gratuity was already added but honestly - 1. she didn't deserve that tip due to her attitude 2. we had to literally flag her down for 20 minutes for us to wrap things up! 

Sadly I would have liked a glass of red with my steak but that would've tagged another $20 to my bill.
I don't think I'll be back just because I can't justify their prices and paying that much for a meal.  It's almost as pricey as a vacation away."}
{"text":"Expensive but amazing. The best steak you'll ever have. Lots of options and the side dishes don't disappoint either. Great for that special occasion."}
{"text":"Hands down my fave restaurant in Toronto! It deserves more than 5 stars!

The service is impeccable, the food is consistent and the atmosphere is intimate. 

My must haves:
1. Caesar Salad (It's rare to find restaurants that still make them table-side) 
2. Potato Gratin 
3. A5 Black Tajima or Snake River Farms' Wagyu
4. Flourless Almond & Coconut Cake

The popovers before dinner and the muffins to take home are to die for. I would just come for these any day. 

Everything is delicious. Pricey, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"As I followed the hostess to the dining room, all while admiring the interior of yet another great steakhouse, my evening was shattered by a piercing cry.  \"What that a...baby?\" I asked in disbelief.  To my utter dismay, she replied sheepishly: \"Yes.\"

And all of a sudden,I felt like...Samantha from Sex & the City.

So began my solo dining experience at Jacobs.  And it got worse.  As I sat down, I realized that sitting directly across from me was this table of Chinese tourists - LOUD and obnoxious and so utterly annoying that I hated myself for forgetting my earphones at the hotel.  For a few minutes, I couldn't decide which was worse - the crying baby, or the loud conversation taking place across from me.  

And after suppressing the thought of getting up and fleeing the scene, I ordered a shot of Scotch, neat, to numb myself from the utter chaos all around.  It couldn't work quickly enough!

All in all, Jacobs is getting 3 stars because the food was good but not spectacular, and here's why:

- They need a better selection of reds by the glass.  What they do have now taste way too young and don't pair with steaks all that well, ironically.

- They could also add a few better appetizers.  Not enough greens, and the portion size is huge...so it prevents you from getting a variety.

The wait staff was very professional and attentive.  But then again, at this price point, I wouldn't expect anything less.

Overall, the food and the service were alright, not exceptional, for the prices they command.  My disappointment was that at these prices (Macallan 25 for $150 and Macallan 30 for $200, plus a 6 oz tenderloin cut of wagyu at $87), I'd expect an old-school, QUIET, classy setting.  They had none of that.  My experience was marred by noise.  Perhaps they should consider banning babies from the premise.  And parents - c'mon, if you can afford a fancy steak dinner, you can afford a sitter for a few hours."}
{"text":"Have been there on a few occasion and the quality of food is not up to par.  We had very under cooked duck fat fries and a very fatty and chewy piece of meat.  Not sure Toronto has a great steakhouse.  I would like to think striving for consistency is a give in for any restaurant.  Something is going on in the kitchen and they need to fix the food quality before I will return.  I mentioned this to my friends and they all agreed that this was their experience of Jacob & Co.  Toronto has lots of choice, if you want to retain your customers you need to improve the customer food experience."}
{"text":"Best steak I've ever had....and I've had a lot of steak. Everything is aged minimum of 60 days. You just can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Has to be the best steakhouse in all of Toronto. Me and a couple of buddies went there on a Friday night without reservations and were seated right away. We started off with the oysters and some $22 Martinis which went hand in hand. for dinner i ordered the 10Oz tenderlion medium. this has the be the showstopper. it just melted in my mouth. words cannot describe the party in my mouth after eatch bite. they also provide these suculent cheese buns to begin, which seem to be coming right out the oven when someone is seated. they also use these cheese buns on the burgers which are really good. ceaser salads are made table side while being educated on their beef varity. Ran in to Andrea Bargnani's while having dinner. nice place to star gaze aswell. 

Jacobs has a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Unbelievable steakhouse -- the food was unbelievable.    First I started with home-made Caesar Salad with anchovies-- made right at your table.   The portion was rather large and it could be shared by 2 people.  For the main course, I had the flat-iron strip loin and I shared this with my friend because he shared 67-day ribeye -- they were able to cut both steaks so we could share.  I've never tasted steak like this before!  Super rich in taste.  They offered different salts and sauces as compliments.  The fries and string beans were great as well.   The ambience is great for couples, group of friends, and it is very modern.  One last thing -- the service was spectacular -- very helpful and informative and super nice!"}
{"text":"I went to Jacob's on my company's dime and man I'm sure glad I did.
The huge drawback to this place is the price tag. but if you have the money to drop then make it a point to head out to this place. 

First of all, it is HARD TO FIND at night. It seems like its a hidden night club in Toronto that you would have never thought to have existed if you have never been to it.

Now, due to dietary reasons (I can't eat unkosher meat) it makes little sense that I go to a steak house for a meal. But from what people have told me, the meat is FANTASTIC and it is quite a meal.

I did get the European Sea Bass/ Absolutely delicious and I still dream about it from time to time. I started the meal off with a Frisee salad and the Blue Cheese is what makes the salad work. Blue Cheese is usually a hard ingredient to work with because it is very overpowering, but they make it work at Jacob's

They also make a decent gin and tonic as well.

In summary: worth it if you have the $$ to spend."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets when it comes to steaks in Toronto. Service is also top notch. Resos are required if you want to guarantee a seat in the dining room. 

Should try the caesar to get the full experience/show, but we've passed on it on subsequent visits. 

Sides are great too: The lobster poutine with duck fat fries was the best, creamed spinach is a classic and the cauliflower is very decadent and rich. You can also get half orders of sides to get more variety."}
{"text":"Such a lovely date night at Jacob's! A very generous friend gave us a gift card, and although neither my hubs or I eat any red meat, we had a delicious dinner eating everything other than their speciality! 
We ordered the caeser salad to start, and it was one of the best I've ever had! The cheese popovers were quite good, but not as mind blowing as stated on Yelp by others, IMHO. 
We then shared the mushroom risotto, organic chicken, sautéed rapini and potato gratin. What I really appreciated about the dishes was that none of it was over salted by the chefs, and a trio of very interesting salts were given to season ourselves if we wished. 
We took desserts to go (pineapple upside down cake and smores cheesecake) as a food coma was setting in quite rapidly, and they were both very tasty. 
Our server Kody really elevated our experience here at Jacob's. He was friendly, extremely helpful with orders in a non-bossy way, and his knowledge of alcohol was beyond impressive! It felt like he truly had a passion for it all, and whether it was him just good at his job or indeed true, we ate it right up and loved the service!!!!! He made the place truly a 5 star experience. 
Also want to add that for a $$$$ restaurant, wines by the glass and cocktails weren't terribly overpriced!  
Thanks for a wonderful night, Jacob's!"}
{"text":"I can see why this is the best steakhouse in town! My boyfriend took me here on valentine's day :) It was quite a big restaurant, hidden in the entertainment district. 

We started off with the must order table side Caesar salad. It was delicious and fresh, probably one of the best Caesar salads I've ever had. Especially loved the homemade dressing, bacon bits, and anchovies.

The server was very helpful, attentive and provided good recommendations. We ordered two steaks to share, the Penokean Hills Prime Angus ribeye (14oz) and the A5 Black Tajima-Kagoshima Prefecture striploin (8oz). The ribeye was amazing and 14oz was a perfect size for two people. The A5 wagyu was very buttery and melted in my mouth. It was delicious but 8oz was a little too much for two people since it was so fattening. We also ordered two glasses of red wine and a gelato to end the meal.

After we asked for the bill, the server brought over two muffins for us to bring home. It was such a thoughtful thing to do as if they want you to remember the meal until the next morning. 

It was an incredible dinner and I will definitely recommend it to anyone who loves steak!"}
{"text":"Returned to Jacobs with two colleagues on a Saturday night for dinner.  Service was impeccable and food was fantastic, as expected.  Upon arrival, I was immediately greeted with a \"Welcome back to Jacobs\" by our server.  He was very attentive and took the time to explain the menu and wine choices.  Jacobs has an extensive winelist and we had chosen a recommended Barolo.  Despite the large markup on wine, which is to be expected, we thoroughly enjoyed our bottle.

We started our evening with the complimentary delicious popovers and also ordered the infamous Jacobs Caesar Salad prepared table side.  Although I had ordered it on my last visit, it remained a nice treat to see the salad prepared.  We had also agreed to share a side of sauteed mushrooms. (On my last visit I had ordered the duck fat fries and the Caesar salad).  The mushrooms were delicious (and my preference over the fries which were not extraordinary).  Now for the steaks... We decided to share three different ribeye steaks between all of us: Canadian Guelph Ribeye, Canadian P.E.I. Ribeye, and the USDA Prime Black Angus Ribeye from Nebraska, in that order.  The steaks were served sliced and timed appropriately so that the steaks were served one after the other.  Just amazing.  

Although I would have loved to try a new dessert here,  all three of us passed on dessert this time as we were content and full.  We were given three complimentary chocolates and fresh Jacobs muffins for breakfast the next day.  Our journey of delicious food and three different steaks made for a glorious evening.   Of course,  I will return..."}
{"text":"Wow.  What can I say about this place that haven't been said already?  How about this:  eating at Jacobs makes me feel like that time Tom Cruise jumped all over Oprah's sofa.  How's that for customer satisfaction?  Even though eating at this place will cost an arm and a leg, it's still something that everyone should do at least once.  Our bill for 2 people was over $700, which is a ridiculous amount to spend on a meal.  To be fair, my ex-boyfriend of 2 years (who I'm mentioned in most of my previous reviews) had broken up with me 3 days ago; this dinner was able to cheer me up.  The steak that we ordered was diamond grade wagyu ribeye that had been dry aged for 50 days.  It was so juicy and just melted in my mouth. I literally went from being a sobbing mess to doing mental backflips of joy.  It was so good that I think it saved me from 3 months of alcoholic depression.

I don't know if this really counts as a objective review seeing how personal things got.  Maybe it's not a good idea for me to share my personal relationship troubles on Yelp but...eh.....why not.  I'm sure my friends are sick of hearing me talk about it so I'm going to try to sneak in the venting anywhere I can."}
{"text":"Wow my first experience at a Toronto steak house is just exceptional. Hands down for the steak and wagyu here! 

Self parking is not that great so better opt for valet parking. This restaurant is spacious. There's a lower dining section with a bar and an upper main dining room. You also have the option to check in your coat at the  reception. 

They start you off with their bacon salad. The bacon is just so crunchy and delicious, has a different taste to it that differs than the  way American restaurants prepares their salad. The seafood tower was also spectacular. Ranges from lobster, crabs, jumbo shrimp and different types of clams. 

Finally for our main course we had New York and Black angus, the steak was very tender and delicious. The steak comes in huge portion so it's better to share the entree with  2 or more person."}
{"text":"Service was great, foods are amazing but the environment is a bit too noisy for me and tables are a bit too close to other customers."}
{"text":"As a steakhouse fan Jacobs in an obvious attraction in Toronto.  The menu looks amazing and features a well thought out and extensive selection of steak from USDA Prime to Japanese A5.  The restaurant itself looks the part with a piano bar downstairs and a lovely dining room upstairs with the aging room on display.  However, on multiple visits i'd never really gone \"this is the best\".  Sometimes the food was very good, sometimes the service was spot on but other times it was just ok.  Our last visit, my last ever visit, was a disaster.  All of our steaks ranging from Prime to Wagyu to Japanese A5 and sides arrived cold or lukewarm (inexcusable at this price point), service was mediocre at best and a bit condescending and pushy at its worst and I left thinking \"what a waste of money\".  Our only mistake was to not send every item back on the spot.  Being polite and voicing our displeasure afterward was greeted with the comment from management that \"the food was eaten\"  Yep, that happens when you're hungry and have been waiting too long for the meal to arrive so we ate the cold steak and sides... shame on us and lesson learned.  Either way, once the food arrives cold the experience is ruined and having them cook a new meal would only have delayed us further.  A promise from the manager to \"reach out\" with a phone call still hasn't happened some 5 days later and I no longer care to receive it.  We threw over a thousand bucks out the window on the meal and that'll be the last time it happens.  In my opinion, Jacobs wants so desperately to be in the same league as great steakhouses like Wolfgang Puck's Cut (which is amazing) and Craftsteak but... it just isn't and after this last fiasco i'll not be returning.  Shame."}
{"text":"This place is definitely as good as it gets. I've been here a few times. All outstanding experiences. 

5 STARS for the restaurant: 5 stars for the ambiance. The dining area is upstairs,  separated from the bar, therefore you aren't interrupted by those lounging in the bar area. The service is just perfect!!

5 STARS for the food: everything from the apps, to your entree, to your dessert is absolutely AMAZING. The little muffin breads they give you at the beginning is so unique. It's nothing close to any other restaurant i've been to. I've tried the chicken and steak. Both are to die for.  All the sides are also amazing. I forgot what I had for dessert, but I do remember it being yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place. The steaks were fantastic with plenty to choose from. My brother said the steak was the best he's ever had and he's a big steak eater that's eaten all over the world. I enjoyed the service and the wine."}
{"text":"Jacobs is possibly the best steakhouse in Toronto and is much more contemporary than traditional steak places. The menu is dedicated to steak of all types and cuts from around the world including delicious but pricey Japanese steak. I enjoyed the steak tartare and some US as well as Japanese cuts. Caesar salads are made table side. Excellent wine list. Jacobs is very pricey so go prepared to spend but it's well worth it. Reservations a few days ahead are a must."}
{"text":"I went there to celebrate family birthday. We chose to sit on their piano bar level. The ambiance was great as the live piano player filled the air with music. They gave us free cup caked shape fluffy bread with garlic creamy spread which was tasty. We started off with the Caesar Salad (the live performance at the table side was cute) which was tasty. I ordered the sea bass while my hubby had the 14oz Angus Steak. For our sides we picked sautéed mushrooms and duck fat fries. Honest opinion on the overall food taste; it was average. We finished it off with  Crème brûlée. The customer service at this venue is excellent. The owner said good bye to us on our way out and asked us about the service, which I felt was very thoughtful. We were also given free muffins to take home.Overall bill was $207 with the tip. It's a great place to celebrate an \"occasion.\""}
{"text":"Let's start with WOW!  In a nutshell, everything from the atmosphere, the hostess, the ambiance, the service, the wine, the food, the bread that tastes like Yorkshire Pudding = SIMPLY AMAZING!

Service - Phenomenal.  We had 4 staff members at our table re-filling our beverages, pouring our wine, making sure everything is well.  Exactly how a steakhouse should be or any restaurant for that matter.  

Food - Exceptional!!! Wagyu was delicious.  My friends had the beef tenderloin with fois gras and that was delicious as well.  I will probably end up getting the steak with the fois gras next time.  I had 2 sides:  Poutine and the Brussel Sprouts. Honestly, brussel sprouts tasted Burnt...not good.  BUT, the poutine, YUM.  My friends' sides were yum too.  They had the sautéed mushrooms which were good and the layer potato dish.  Yum as well.  The lobster cobb salad as an appetizer was AMAZING! Definitely worth ordering.  Next time I am getting my own.  Not sharing lol

Dessert - 12 layer cake - WOW!!!  

I also saw the seafood platter which my friends and I are planning to go back and try out.  

MUST TRY this place!  You will love it!"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago we know what good steak is and what it costs.  The steak here was pretty good but way way overpriced.   Sides were ok. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Absolutely great staff and service! Appetizers come in large portions; super yummy:) I ordered the sea bass; yes it is a steakhouse, but I wanted fish. Lol Really good fish :) loved it."}
{"text":"The following is a list of the best things on the planet. This is not an opinion, but a statement of fact**:

1) No pants dance parties
2) Cheese in any format
3) The caesar salad from Jacob's

The steaks and service are incredible, and certainly shouldn't be overlooked...but the caesar is the absolute prize. It was so good, that it impacted me physically, emotionally and spiritually. Order it with anchovies. I don't even like anchovies, but they make love to the salad in this case. 

My date chose not to have any, which meant that I had the entire bowl to myself. Did this impact my breath in a negative way, and most likely take any sort of post-dinner makeout session off the table? Yes. Was it worth it? Absolutely.

** This is 100% an opinion, and not a statement of fact."}
{"text":"Impeccable service all around. From the greeter, to server, to the Sommelier, we found ourselves surrounded by super friendly and professional staff.  I was guided to the washroom and en route, all the workers would step aside as if they were giving you the right of way. I wish drivers in Toronto were like that. 

Now on to the the food, I've never been a steak fan but I chow down my fair share here. I was impressed with the Caesar salad which was made from stretch and the different types of salt/sauce that can go well with a piece of steak. We ordered waygu steak from Japan and 20 oz rib steak with fries and rapini as sides. Everything was delicious.  The only thing I wish was done differently was the timing when the steaks came out. Both steaks were bought out at the same time but you can't eat the waygu until you finish the rib steak first otherwise you will feel cheated. By the time we finished the rib steak, the Waygu was cold. It was still good but would have been heaven if it was hot. 

This is a fine dinning resto with very expensive prices however, is worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Steak perfect. Tender cooked medium as requested. Service great. 5 star no doubt. Atmosphere contemporary and progressive. Not your average steakhouse!"}
{"text":"It's like dreaming about your crush, but when you finally talk to her, she is just a basic girl... speaking specifically about the $450 A5 Black Tajima-Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan. For months on end, I was dreaming about this special moment... when that piece of premium Wagyu melts in my mouth. In reality, what I got was an overwhelming amount of fat that just clogged up my arteries and left my mouth with a really disgusting aftertaste. I could not eat more than 2-3 slices. The sides of spinach, mushrooms and brussel sprouts were also quite average. One saving grace about this restaurant was the Mashima reserve striploin, which was absolutely delicious (5/5 stars) and the only cut I will get next time."}
{"text":"Date night with hubby. Ordered the duck fat fries, asked to have it twice fried and they accomodated no questions asked. It was crispy on the outside and soft interior and the flavor was delish. Steak was juicy and the array of salt choices were incredible.  The mash was creamy and asparagus just perfectly cooked and seasoned. The staff was professional and knew their products and genuinely made you feel catered to.  Great ambiance and everything about the place was perfect."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was excellent. Of course your wallet will hurt a little but it was well worth it. The sides are sharing portions, we thought it was individual so we got three which was a bit too much. Dessert was yummy!!"}
{"text":"Used to come here at all times , but seems like they aren't at its best shape anymore... Risotto wasn't as good and steak didn't impress like it always does."}
{"text":"this is a fantastic place to go. waiters are very considerate and recommendations are reasonable. Ceasar salad is perfect tasting. great experience!"}
{"text":"By far, the BEST restaurant in the city! 

The steaks are always tender, and cooked to perfection. Sides are amazing, and good sized portions. The table side Cesar salad is the best I've ever had. 

Impeccable service each and every time. The last time I was there they sat us at a table that we weren't happy with. They immediately moved us and offered a complimentary glass of prosecco. 

It can be expensive, but the value of food and service makes it worth every penny. If you're celebrating something special, then Jacobs is the place to go."}
{"text":"What a pleasant dining experience! 
I would give 5 stars.

We had acclaimed Jacobs Caesar Salad to start. Sure, it was fun to watch table side preparation of it. The salad was a little spicy for me. Maybe it was the peppers they used or something in the dressing. Before the salad, they gave us something looking like Yorkshire pudding, popovers, with a dipping sauce. That was a chewy bread.
 
Next, we got Lobster Chowder to share. The waiter was so helpful and even served the chowder into two bowls for us. This dish came with a large piece of crab, caviar, corn and potatoes. They didn't give us a lobster cracker that would have been extra useful in getting the crab meat, but it wasn't very hard to get it out. The soup was delicious and it was a good value for what we got.

Onto the highlight of the night, Wagyu Steak. We had a 10 oz wagyu Idaho tenderloin steak to share. Omg, this was the best steak ever! Perfectly cooked to medium rare, the steak just melted in my mouth. The steak came with three kinds of salt, 1. white regular sea salt 2. sea salt from Mold, England 3. black lava salt from Hawaii, and three kinds of sauces, 1. ponzu 2. chimichurri 3. bacon dipping sauce that tasted similar to the dipping sauce they gave us previously with popovers. I found the chimichurri sauce refreshing but the steak itself was SOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOD; you don't need to add any more salts or sauces to it.       

The service was very attentive and friendly. Other than placing spoons on the wrong side, (he still came back quickly to fix it), the waiter provided an excellent service. He made sure our glasses were full of water at all times, folded my napkin while I excused myself from the table, and always entered from one side to take our orders and to ask if we needed anything. I guess you could say that's the level of service you would expect from a steakhouse of this kind, but I still appreciated little things they did to make our dining experience superb. 

The ambiance is upscale, elegant and intimate. Seating upstairs is definitely nicer but if you like live piano music, seating downstairs would be awesome, too. There is a valet parking available for $20. This place is expensive so budget accordingly for a special treat once in a while. It is one of the fanciest restaurants in town suitable for dressing up and celebrating special occasions!"}
{"text":"I reserve this place for all the special occasions in my life. The ambiance is romantic and elegant: it's dimly lit with soft candlelights, a piano bar on the main floor and exposed wine fridges as you head upstairs to the dining room. 

... but nothing beats that smell of salty, mouth watering meat! 

Must-have sides: 
Caesar salad: prepared table side, this salad is delicious without being too creamy;
Potato puree: a fluffly cloud from heaven in your mouth;
Creamed spinach: because vegetables are healthy and this is so tasty;
Duck fat fries: everything good in life, in every bite. 

Sides worth passing up: 
Rapini: while this side is truly delicious, I've been able to recreate it at home; 
Potato gratin: in a war between the potatoes, the puree always wins! 
Mushrooms: I get this 50% of the time because they're so much value added but too simple to justify spending $16 on.

Now let's talk meat! I've personally never spent the ~1k on the kobe beef, but i've heard spectacular things and cannot judge anyone who splurges. From my experience, the wait staff typically make the best recommendations on their meat, but I almost always end up ordering the bone-in porterhouse, medium-rare to rare. I am never disappointed! 

This place is a perfect 10/10 from their fluffy starter bread, to their take-home muffins!"}
{"text":"During a trip to Toronto, I checked out Jacobs because I heard a lot of good things about this place. Had the grade A5 Kobe Black Tajima-Hyogo Prefecture Ribeye and it was delicious. The best steak I had in my life, each piece melted in my mouth. Service was top-notch as well, if I'm ever in Toronto again I will make sure to eat here again."}
{"text":"Great Place and Amazing Service!
The Caesar Salad is probably the best I have tried!
Steaks are awesome, I would say about 35% overpriced but done to perfection. The service is perfect! One time I was not 100% satisfied with my steak (just a small piece of unchewable fat) they removed this $140 steak for the final bill with no questions asked!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best steakhouses I've ever been to. Incredible ambiance, prompt service (even though we arrived without reservations on a Friday night), and mindblowing steaks. 

I've never seen a menu with cuts from different parts of the country. Impressive selection. 

I got an 8oz dry aged filet. Perfect mid rare and a hard seat with a gorgeous crispy crust. A tad under salted, but they brought a spread of finishing salts to the table. Sprinkle a bit over the crust and let the heat and juices dissolve it in. Absolutely brilliant and perfect.

The magic of this place is in the details-- having a perfect compound butter with the bread, and an impeccably balanced cocktail. They also display a $700 A5 dry aged kobe ribeye... wow. 

Its pricey, but worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We had visited Jacobs to celebrate a special occasion and were not disappointed, they were aware that we were there celebrating and started our dinner with a glass of champagne. The Oysters (which I believe are from Rodney's) were so delicious!  Our steaks were cooked  and seasoned perfectly.. The salts on the sides were amazing! and of course the fries were to die for. They also acknowledged our anniversary on the dessert plate which was another beautiful touch... Let's not forget about the muffins they send you out with...they are the most tastiest decadent muffins you will likely ever have, tried to steal my husbands but I was quickly shut down :(. Great dinner, excellent ambiance, great service!"}
{"text":"The apps and bread are so amazing you will be full by the time your steaks arrive."}
{"text":"Went to Jacobs last night for the first time.  I previewed the menu and read a bunch of Yelp reviews before going, so I was ready for the very hefty price tag on the meal.  As it turned out, it was the most expensive meal I have ever eaten.  

The question is was it worth it?

We started with a cocktail in the piano lounge while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive.  I enjoyed the old school elegance of it.  It was well-appointed without being stuffy.  Our table in the dining room upstairs was situated right beside the glassed display of meat.  I am not a steak connoisseur by any stretch of the imagination, but I could appreciate the care they put into curating this selection.  

We had the Cesar salad as did everyone it seemed.  I wasn't a huge fan of them making it at the table.  The constant beating of egg yolks all around me took away from any pleasure of watching the salad being constructed... I realize in pointing this out that I'm being a bit of a princess. Either way, the salad was delicious.

We selected four different steaks cooked as the chef saw fit, and we shared them among us.  My favourite was the Waygu.  I really enjoyed the sauces and salts that accompanied the meat.  We also tried the fries, the asparagus in Hollandaise sauce, and a seasonal creamed corn dish.  I didn't try the corn, but the other dishes were excellent and three sides between four people was ample.  In lieu of dessert, we enjoyed a scotch after dinner.  I appreciated the good selection of single malts.

So... the verdict?  It was a very memorable meal.  The service was fantastic, the food excellent quality.  Will I be back?  Likely not, but if I had a sudden influx of disposable cash I certainly would!"}
{"text":"I feel like a black sheep for writing a 1 star review, but my experience at Jacob's was so below standard that I don't even want to consider a possibility of giving this place another chance.

To begin I know a lot of people would choose this place as a treat for special someone or to spend a romantic dinner together. Well, how romantic could your dinner be when you are cramped behind a tiny table that has another table at a distance of 20 cm? I was practically involved in the conversation the other couple was having. The server was not even able to approach me from the right side, he had to pass dishes from above my head, a dangerous task if you are balancing a freshly grilled steak on a hot iron plate. 

The service in itself was far from spectacular and rather nonexistent, no prompt water or wine refills, we had to resort to pouring our own wine. Cesar salad that was made at the table was made behind our back because of the cramped space around the table. It also took 20 minutes for a server to finally figure out the dressing, after about 6 minutes I just turned away and carried on conversation with my partner.

Food was the biggest obstacle of all I believe. Salad was bland and the lettuce used was cut into super large chunks, making it challenging to eat. I had to return my steak because it was overcooked and charred to obscenity instead of medium rare I requested. My partner did not find his steak to be any better than a restaurant we frequent that is 3 times cheaper. Duck fries were dry and overcooked. Manager offered us desert as a compensation for the meal. Unfortunately that did not save the experience. When spending close to $300 on a meal it takes a little more than an Okay dessert to pull it off. 

Luckily Toronto is full of good steakhouses that will mend my soul and my budget."}
{"text":"Going to Jacob's is a culinary experience.  Our server, Jose, was probably the best server I have ever had.  He gave the sincere impression that he actually loved his job ad he e played a huge part in my love for this restaurant.  

We were a party of 6 and we ordered three steaks to share between us (one was a Porterhouse, another was a T-bone and the last one was a Wagyu striploin)  This was my first time trying Wagyu beef.  It was delicious but a little too fatty for my taste.  The Porterhouse was probably my favourite.  It was the most flavorful even without the sauces that they bring with the steak.  I love the different salts they bring - the salt really brings out the flavour of the meat.  

We tried most of the sides.  I was hoping there would be sweet potato side but the Chef only adds one in the Fall I was told.  My favourites had to the scalloped potatoes and the duck fat fries.  I could easily skip the rest.  

Apart from the steak, the other culinary highlight was the Ceasar salad.  This was easily the best ceasar salad I have ever had.  Simply outstanding.   I understand that there is a video online showing how to make it step by step.  Of the appetizers, I loved the Bresaola and my dining companions raved about the Beef Tartare saying that it was the best they had ever tasted.  I am not a huge fan of beef tartare but I tried it and it was good.  The Oysters Rockefeller were dry.  I would not order them again.  

We ordered the fruit plate, S'Mores Cheesecake and Monkey Break for dessert.  The Cheesecake was devoured - I tried it but it is too sweet for me.  The fruit plate was gorgeous but the Monkey Bread was my favourite.  

If you are celebrating a special occasion or want to impress someone, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The good: what in the world is A5 Black Tajima steak...the best steak ever. It has some nice fat marbled into the meat that make it so easy to melt in your mouth. It was worth it...and I wanted more. I highly recommend to try it, even the little piece! As the waiter said there aren't many locations in Toronto that actually have it; so if you won't be able to travel to get it, here is the place. The Caesar salad had a nice show, where they mixed it in front of you and divided it to two bowls. I liked the bread that they served beforehand and at the end, they give you some cute muffins to take home. I came her on my birthday and was also nicely surprised with a plate of chocolates and candle. It was a nice touch. 

The bad: The time that I went was on a Monday, and I had no idea how noisy it would be. We were seated right near a very loud table and it interrupted the mood and our conversation (even the table next to us complained). I understand that we didn't complain but it would've been nice that they acknowledged it and did something about it (move our table). 

Overall, it was a nice experience at a hefty price but, a memorable night."}
{"text":"So amazing. Honestly one of the best steaks I've ever had in my life. The service was wonderful and didn't feel pressured at all.

The table side caesar salad was amazing and fun to watch.

We also had the potato gratin and mushrooms which were also very good.

We will definitely be returning to Jacobs and co as soon as we can!!"}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday and no regrets at all! The steaks were AMAZING!!! 

Started with the beef tartar ($26)
Raw diced beef mixed in anchovy, caper, egg yolk, and truffle oil. This was a big piece of beef tartar, portion wise was a lot more generous than other places. This was really tasty, ingredients were fresh and it was flavorful, but I would say I've had better.

22 oz Bone in Ribeye ($110 + $9 for the bone marrow)
This aged 70 days bone in ribeye from Canadian Prime Hereford - High River Alberta was AMAZING!!! The meat was super juicy and tender. It was PERFECTLY seared, the outside of the steak were so perfectly grilled that it had a nice crisp. Each bite was amazing. We asked for our steak to be medium rare which was right on point, only thing was when we got to the more center part of the steak it was slightly more rare than medium rare. The steak was flavorful, even though they gave us salts from different countries and variety of sauces, the steak was so good it didn't even need the sauce and tasted great on its own. You have the option of adding sides to your dish, we added bone marrow which was delicious!

7 oz California cut Striploin Wagyu ($105)
This was the Sekai Ranch Wagyu from Puslinch Ontario at medium rare. We decided to go for the mid marble wagyu instead of trying the super fatty wagyu. This steak was delicious. The meat was nice and tender, perfectly seared with a a nice crisp on the outside. The steak was flavorful, even though they gave us salts from different countries and variety of sauces, the steak was so good it didn't even need the sauce and tasted great on its own.

Half serving of the Mushroom risotto ($16)
I like how they have they have the option of half portions - they split their mains into half the serving size. We wanted some carbs to go along with our steak so decided to go with the mushroom risotto. There were a lot of mixed mushrooms. Could use a bit more Parmigiano in my opinion. Dish was good, but nothing too special.

Overall, loved the experience! The food was great! Expensive but well worth the price. Service was good - our waiter was knowledgeable and explained steak selections thoroughly. My only comment was the area they seated us in got pretty loud - the hostess said it was a more 'quiet' room, but not sure if it's cause the tables beside us had a few drinks and got rowdy, but it was not a quiet atmosphere at all."}
{"text":"Great steak with good flavor; gotta said it's pretty expensive but worth to try. I ordered Canadian 60 days age striolring streak. :)"}
{"text":"Came here again last night with my fiance for dinner. It was lovely & yummy like before but I took off 1 star for the weird hostess at the front and the lack of vegetarian apps
We had ressies @ 9:30pm and I asked her when we checked in to not be seated in the \"quiet area\" room in the back and she responded like that is the only area you can sit in. She was shocked when we asked to wait at the bar until the dining room would be available. She said we couldn't sit at the two available chairs at the downstairs bar b/c they were reserved? I was like ok what about the upstairs bar? She said we will just seat you upstairs at the table and you can move. I thought that was silly. When they walked us upstairs there was room at the bar up there. Again the hostess was so AWKWARD and weird. She was like ya I guess you could sit here. I figured why ruin a table and be seated and reseated if there is a BAR there to sit and have a drink and wait. We ordered drinks and 5 Min's later a new (and much more normal) waitress said the table was ready in the dining room for us! So it all worked out Lil
Food was great, fiance had 14oz rib-eye (can't rem which one), I had the fries salad, ordered sides of mushrooms (AMAZING here!), beans (asked for them steamed vs brown buttered), soup & duck fat fries (for the man). Ordered a bottle of pinto grigio and fiance had a few Heinekins. They gave us the yummy morning muffins and 2 little complimentary desserts. 
Overall, hostesses need to a little work on how to seat customers @ the bar lol and please add another veg option :P
Def will come back!"}
{"text":"I came here with my bro on a busy night. Not really planned, just kinda dropped in cause it was his birthday. We didn't have a reservation and it was pretty busy, but they quickly offered us a spot at the bar upstairs.

It was perfect because there was a basketball game on, and we got to watch the bartender dude prepare oysters and talk about steaks and shoot the shit. He was a cool dude and super helpful. After getting a detailed explanation of the cuts and other stuff I've long since forgotten, he gave us recommendations and we ended up ordering 2 steaks - Alberta meat vs US somewhere, some beefsteak tomatoes and potato gratin.

Based on the recommendation of super waiter, we ended up sharing the steaks between my bro and I so that we could compare and contrast the steaks. They were definitely different, very different, but both really delicious. My bro preferred the US steak but I liked the Albert cut, although honestly they were both really really tasty. The sides were also fantastic. That potato gratin, my gawd!

After the meal, super waiter offered us some free dessert wine even though we couldn't move. I accepted but my brother declined, then we got a tour of the temperature controlled steak room where the magic happens. It was a really great experience, and I am glad I ate here. It was a classy steakhouse that didn't feel all uppity, but rather welcoming instead. I would definitely recommend this place and would love to come again! Jacobs, you rock!"}
{"text":"If fancy restaurants aren't part of your daily life, entering Jacob's & Co. Steakhouse will feel like you've won the lottery (only instead, you'll end up paying a generous bill later on). The decor gives this restaurant the quirk and character which I really loved.

But enough about the decor, let's talk about the food.

To start, we were brought bread in the shape of muffins. Let me tell you, this is probably one of the best breads I've ever had. EVER. The bread itself is perfectly crunchy on the outside and hollow on the inside, but is the perfect container for all that steam that just puffs out when you tear it open.

I had the 8oz Michima Reserve Wagyu tenderloin and I have to say, it's pretty close to the Akita beef I had in Japan months ago. Very soft, tender, and well seasoned.

And the fries.... duck fat fries to be specific, were amazing too.

I can't say enough amazing things about this place. If you're looking for a fancy place to treat yourself or your significant other, I HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"As far as steakhouses go, I can't say that this is the best steak I have ever had. In fact, in Toronto alone, I believe Barbarian Steakhouse is much better. Nevertheless, everything else about the restaurant is top notch and perhaps I am not not as appreciative of the beef as I should be. 

The service is great and is everything one would expect from a restaurant like this - not much to say here. We started with a beer and a martini, didn't have any appetisers as we knew that there's no way we can fit that much food in us. The server gave an explanation of all the options and we shared an 18oz bone-in striploin as per recommendation. They cut the steak for us as it was being shared, which was nice. A side of duck fat french fries and sauteed mixed mushrooms. Everything was good, but nothing I felt was extraordinary. 

I think what bumped it up for me from being a 3 star was their side dressings. There was a dish that had three difference sauces, one was a blue cheese, another called chimichurri and a japanese soy sauce (ponzu). And then a dish with three types of salts. My favourite was the chimichurri and my friend's favourite was the ponzu. Dipping the meat in the sauce made it better, but i've had some really good steak that doesn't require any dressing....

I enjoyed being in the restaurant, and I enjoyed the food. Nevertheless at this price point, I was not wow'ed. But then again, to be fair, I am very rarely wow'ed by steakhouses so I do rate much harsher."}
{"text":"Paying a pretty penny for a damn good steak, it is expected to enjoy delicious food, chic ambiance and great service.  The food and place didn't disappoint.  
This is going back a bit - and I haven't returned since - but my big complaint is that THEY DIDN'T ACCEPT DEBIT.  WTF kind of a restaurant doesn't accept debit?  Does anyone know if this has been fixed?"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the steak it was delicious other then that the service was meh and the side dishes were not up to par for the type of restaurant this is. This place is expensive and i didn't feel it was worth it."}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouses in Toronto, great atmosphere, professional service while serving the Cesar salad the server let us know if we want pork with our salad. The steak was tender, juicy and delicious. Would go again for sure."}
{"text":"Fan, fan, fan. And that's 'fan' as in 'fantastic'! I loved my visit here. The service was very gracious, and our server definitely knew his stuff about what he was serving...he gave us a 15-20 mini-info session on all the kinds of steaks they served, and we were riveted.

We ordered the infamous caesar salad, and also the beef tartare. For me, I got the smallest Wagyu steak, and for contrast, my date got the NY angus beef sirloin 12 ounce, I think. The caesar salad \"show\" was great! Although my comment that it seemed a bit like a witch making a brew was probably offputting (\"pinch of salt, dash of bacon bits, eye of newt, hair of enemy)

Steaks...oh MY. Mine was buttery soft, all about the texture and the melt. My date's steak was ALSO amazing, in a completely different way...the flavour was the BEST I've had. 

And that beef tartare was also super generous sized.

And when you throw in a plethora of dipping salts/sauces, plus complimentary muffins to take home....it makes for a top-notch meal. Will come again and again and again...."}
{"text":"Came for boyfriend's birthday. The waiter was so patient answering all questions we had and explained to us different type of steak. The salad that was made in front of you was really fun and side orders are huge. Love it!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the fuss is about on the Caesar's salad here! guys! It's the same salad you get at any restaurant. They just blend the ingredients in front of you! Honestly, it didn't taste as good as some of the people claim. I loved the seafood tower as appetizer. The portions of the steaks are perfect and I adored the fries! This place is ridiculously expensive though!"}
{"text":"If you want to have a nice dinner in a trendy setting I wouldn't highly recommend here. The staff was great, the food was awesome and the steak was incredible. I highly recommend the ribeye with the duck fat fries. The scalloped potato is very tasty as well."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate our condo sale. The last amazing steak we had was the waygu trio in las Vegas at cut. We had heard a lot of hype about this place and based on that it was on my list to try. 

We made rezzos for dinner at 7:30 and arrived just a bit early. Service is amazing. The staff all know what customer service is about, water was constantly refilled, recommendations were fantastic and any questions we had were answered intelligently. We were given those pop over things which were sooo yummy. Fresh out of the oven, hot and slathered with herbed butter = heaven. I would have eaten the second one if we didn't need to save room for the rest of the food.

We reluctantly ordered the Cesar salad. Main reason being that we have had table side Cesar salads already. We can also make one from scratch at home so it didn't seem ground breaking to us. The table beside us really hyped up and praised the salad... saying thwy would get 1 each if they could it was that good. When the server arrived to make it... the bowl was positioned in such a way you couldnt even see them making it you just saw them dump stuff in and mix it. The salad was delicious and well made but at 18dollars ... if you are familiar with this concept ... I would likely skip.  The portion was also sooo big that I feared the steak and side we ordered. 

When the steak arrived we had hot plates each which was fantastic to keep the meat warm. We ordered two 6 oz ribeyes - both aged 60 days and 1 from the us and the other from Canada. Each steak was about 60/70.00. Both were delicious but we actually enjoyed the canadian beef more. The Sid of waygu stuffed potato was yummy and well priced. It was alao huge and enough to share. The steak came with 4 assorted salts and 4 sauces. The salts were interesting and used the most. We were absolutely too stuffed for desert. They brought over 2 chocolates with the bill and a doggy bag for our two fresh complimentary chocolate chips muffins for breakfast the next day which we enjoyed! 

One of the cray things was the wine list. Extensive but 90% of the bottles were over 200.00-300.00. Sorry but we don't have that much money to spend on wine. More choices a in the 100.00 range would be appreciated. Thats my only miff.  

Otherwise thanks and we will be back for another special occasion."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is amazing especially the steaks! Service is superb! Worth the $$$$"}
{"text":"Jacobs knows their beef, and their meat cellar is impressive to say the least.  The restaurant itself is dimly light and elegantly decorated, with a piano bar in the downstairs section.  Their menu is a little pricey but worth the splurge.  The caesar salad is made fresh, table side.  The fries are fried in duck fat and delicious.  The tartare is wonderfully seasoned and very fresh.  A note on their sides, they are definitely made for sharing as the portions are very generous.  Finally, the steak...oh so delicious.  Regardless of which cut you get, you will not be disappointed.    A nice touch at the end of the meal, muffins to take home!"}
{"text":"Came here a few times with my family- a wide variety of steaks, knowledgeable staff and a good drink selection. I like that their sides are family style :) Duck fat fries and flourless chocolate cake w/bacon ice cream are divine."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite steakhouse in Toronto, for the steak quality, variety, service, ambiance, and the complimentary take-home muffin (lol). The servers do a good job of explaining differences between different types of steaks and are helpful in selecting one based on your preferences. The sizes tend to be large and you won't find many choices less than 12 oz. I recommend the caesar salad which is made fresh table-side and also the duck fat fries which are super yummy!"}
{"text":"Jacob & Co definitely lives up to the expectation.  Before coming here,  I thought '' how good can a steak get? ''  I personally never saw any form of art in steak.  To me,  it's a grilled piece of meat.   Even a hamburger is more artsy cus you need to compliment the toppings.   
We had a hard time with the menu since there different regions where you can choose your cow from -  anywhere from domestic Canadian to USA, Australia,  and Japan.  I picked the wagyu Kobe need tenderloin from USA  and my boyfriend picked the wagyu Kobe beef Cali cut from Australia.  Both Kobe beef,  we wanted to try the difference.  Our server David was very knowledgeable of the menu. He definitely helped a lot in deciding which one to get. He went into detail from which farm the cow was originated from, even what it was fed before served on your plate.  The ones from PEI would be fed with potatoes and the more expensive one from Japan are fed with alfalfa, edamame beans and fresh fruit.  So its like a cannibal it's like picking between people that was once a vegan or someone like me, eats junk food all day.  I guess I wouldn't taste that great.

Note: All the beef were aged 30-60 days. Aged meaning they leave their meat in a special compartment placed upstairs of the restaurant in the glass case, it tenderizes the meat by keeping it in high humidity ,and low temperature. 

Let me start off with the bread.  The muffin looking bread is actually a croissant!  I told myself not to eat the whole thing to stuff myself before the food comes.  I couldn't help it..  It was soft and flaky..  I could easily say it's the best bread I've ever had...  Especially when dipped with garlic butter. After asking the server whether the bread was outsourced (hoping I can buy it from somewhere else), he said Jacob & co have their own specialized baker that comes in every morning to bake their bread and cakes for the day. WOW.  You do get what you pay for.

There is a noticeable difference for taste between the Australian Kobe beef than the ones from USA!  The Australian cow was charred on the outside so it's crispy,  while the inside is so soft and tender you barely need to chew it.  Once you bite into it,  the butter/fat immediately melts in your mouth. As for the difference between taste, Wagyu flavour is bolder, more irony - if you absolutely love the the bloody taste of red meat then it's definitely for you... and for me.  I've been to Ruth Chris,  and Gibby's Montreal, Jacob & Co would be ranked #1. The USA one was 60$ for a 6oz and the Australian is 8oz for $100. The extra $40 you pay for is definitely worth it. After trying the Australian cow, the USA was a mehhhh. It just wasn't the same.  The steak came with 3 different salts-  sea salt, and i forget the other 2 but it was yellowy and black... black one has a bit of a smokey flavour, and also 3 sauces to compliment: blue cheese, ponzu, and parsley. They are great additions but you wouldn't want to put too much dressing on it to over power the $100 steak you're paying for.

I ordered a lobster tail on top of it for an extra $30. To be honest it wasn't the greatest. They only broiled it with no seasoning. I was a little disappointed.  but hey! It's a steak house, if I wanted good lobster I would go to a specialized place. 

We also tried the duck fat frit since we've noticed yelpers blogged about it. It was $12, but we ordered half order .. what came out was something equivalent size to a McDonald's small fries, and the appearance just looked like regular fries... where is the duck?  Once I bit into you, I noticed a small hint but noticeable flavour of the duck claimed on the menu. From my guess, I think they might've deep fried the potatoes with duck fat. Whoever thought of it was a genius.

When the bill came after a well satisfied meal, the server gave us complimentary dark chocolate almond bite. Maybe I was in a good mood, but even that bite size chocolate was amazing. What looked like a block of chocolate with an almond on top, there's actually chocolate mousse inside, so its crunchy and soft. It was too good to resist I had to ask the server for more. David also gave us 2 muffins to take home. Marketing at its best,  to remind their customers the morning after how amazing their meal was from the night before.

I hope my review helped with your beef selection. I highly recommend spending a little more on the meat, it's definitely worth my hard earned money."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better steaks i've had in my lifetime.  What i like about them is that they don't really put much on their steaks.  I'm not a big fans of steak with sauce and i prefer to have the meat juice do the tantalizing and not some creamy sauce.  

The caesar salad was pretty amazing.  It's definitely something you should get.  They also spin and prepare it right in front of you.  It's a nice touch.  There's a myriad of sides that were honestly not the most impressive, but they were good.  I can't really remember the sides i had but i'm pretty sure the duck fat fries were amazing.

I'll be coming here again in a week for business.  Hopefully i can give a more thorough review!"}
{"text":"This is a place that takes steak very seriously. All of the cuts -- and there are many -- are identified by aging time and the provenance of the meat. 

I never thought I'd say this about a Canadian steakhouse, but Jacobs had the best steak I've ever eaten. Period. I've been here twice and both times the cuts (a 56-day aged on-the-bone filet and a 42-day aged strip) were beautifully aged and marbled, and cooked to perfection -- I order my steaks blue and that's how they were when I got them. Love the accompanying sauces and spices.

The duck fat fries are sublime. If you don't want to shell out for steak, just come to the bar and get a drink and some fries. It's worth it just to come here for them.

No fault with the service.

So why only four stars? Well, the place has been pretty dead. Sure, one time was a Monday evening, but it was only half-full on Saturday night at 9pm. Given the space here -- you're led downstairs, past a piano bar and up into the main dining area -- this is the type of place that needs to be loud and busy. It felt a little weird to be eating here with empty tables around me, especially when the steak is so good."}
{"text":"It is expensive and you get what you pay for!

Food is awesome and service is awesome.

I started with a caesar salad. Sounds boring right? Not here. They make it table side. Dressing is made from scratch, anchovies are present (in the best way) and the bacon is salty, thick and amazing.

Steak selection is vast. We tried a few. Each one awesome. Just go for what you normally like.

Sides were also great, but not the highlight. 

Monkey bread dessert was awesome. Just go for it and trust me. They also had a good beer selection, which was a nice treat for a steak house.

Go if you're in the mood for a splurge!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places for steak in Toronto. I've had a couple of different steaks from here, and they've been really great. Except the 60 days aged steak that one waiter recommended, which was tough and I didn't enjoy it. What a waste! Anyway, my two favourite cuts were the Japanese Wagyu ($200 for 6 oz) and the deceptively small US Wagyu ($130 for 6 oz) but very filling. 

If I had to choose between the two salads, I prefer the lobster salad more only because I love lobster. However, the Caesar Salad is definitely a staple starter and big enough to share. 

Been here for different occasions (anniversaries, casual dinner and business), and service has been pretty consistent. 

Seriously debating whether to try their Kobe beef on our upcoming dinner. Or just wait until 2018 ... cause we'll be in Kobe again for sure. I'll probably wait cause spending $200 for a 4 oz steak (and no meat sweat) doesn't seem that appealing."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Great steak. Lovely ambiance. Kobe steaks. 

All the things that I like... with a little Himalayan salt sprinkled on top. 

The servers are knowledgeable and definitely know their steak. 

Personally I found the caesars salad to be a bit overrated though."}
{"text":"This is the first real steakhouse I've ever been to so take note I might be a little easily impressed. I mean I've always been pretty satisfied with the filet mignon at The Keg. Keeping that in mind, I'll say that Jacob's served up the best steak I've ever had. To start, we ordered the famous caesar salad. It was good and definitely different from your usual caesar salad since it's got a spicy flavour and they use the bigger, firm bacon chunks. It might be a bit too spicy for some. As everyone said, they do make it tableside which is a nice novelty. I've got to say I think this dish is kind of over-hyped. It was good but probably not $19 good. I came to this conclusion after seeing how good the lobster chowder was! They give you a big, very shareable bowl of chowder which is filled with crab, a bit of caviar and the biggest lobster claw I've ever seen. I'd definitely order that over the caesar salad anytime since they're both around the same price point. Finally on to the steak. My date and I shared the 10z tenderloin from Snake River Farms Wagyu (a hybrid of it at least). This was THE best steak I've ever had. I was worried it'd be similar to tenderloin I've had at lesser restaurants considering how expensive it is, but I was not disappointed one bit. It's just something you've got to try at least once in your life. It was just so flavourful, juicy and there was not one chewy bit to be found. They give you a few types of salt and dips/creams to add flavour to the steak. I sampled them, but I still preferred the steak by itself since there was already so much flavour. We ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly and came to us at the right temperature too. Along with the muffins they give you at the end of the dinner and the bread at the beginning, this was enough to make for a filling dinner.

The atmosphere here is fancy and most people were dressed up in suits/dresses. There's a piano lounge downstairs where you can choose to eat, but it's not as nice as the setting upstairs. Last but not least, I've got to mention that our waiter was by far the most professional and friendly waiter that I've ever met, and this wasn't my first time at an upscale restaurant. Kudos to him!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, all the servers knew all their facts and were so friendly, like super friendly where if you walk past them, they'll stand to the side, wave you by and smile at you. Kind of unnerving at the beginning. 

When you order a Caesar salad, they make it fresh infront of you. Like actually fresh. They make the dressing right there, they crack an egg and everything. Best way to eat when youre with a group is to order a bunch of different steaks and share. Expensive as shit tho but good for special occasions. They also have valet."}
{"text":"If you have cash to spend then I suggest coming to this fine establishment.

The food and the service is superb and also if you're a steak lover then this is a must try.

It is a little ok the pricy side but you also get what you paid for.  It's cooked to perfection. Also the service is amazing at this place.  Our waiter went above and beyond for my parents 40th wedding anniversary."}
{"text":"Amazing steaks & best caesar salad I have ever eaten. Very friendly and helpful staff I really know nothing about steaks, aging, different cuts etc and this was a delight. Amazing dinner"}
{"text":"It was not the food nor the service that left a lasting impression on me, it was their paper towel. The softest most thick paper I have ever seen, I felt bad throwing it out! That being said, you can get a feel for how spectacular this restaurant is. 

Our waiter was very knowledgeable about his steaks and made several wonderful recommendations. You can tell them you plan on sharing the steaks and they will slice it for you. 

Our waiter also talked highly about their Caesar salad made table side and although it was very fancily prepared (they need to take a cooking course in order to be able to make this salad) I found it very mediocre and disappointing. The bacon tasted like rock salt but you could tell very high quality ingredients were used. 

The oysters were amazingly fresh. Even better than some of Toronto's speciality oyster restaurants like Oyster boy and Rodney's house. Our waiter was also very knowledgeable about his oysters because when I told him I wanted something similar to malpeque, he knew exactly what to order. 

Finally, the steaks were extremely tender but not the \"melt in your mouth like its fish\" taste I've been hearing people rave about. The steaks come with 6 dipping sauces/salts to ensure you don't have a bland experience. Is it weird I was upset they didn't have mustard? 

I went when it wasn't too busy so we had very attentive service. Bonus points that they called down to the valet as we were paying so we didn't need to wait for our car. The valet even turned on the heat for us! Overall, this restaurant knows how to impress. I still enjoy scaramouche over Jacob just for a more diverse menu, but for the best steak in town I will always go to Jacob. The service is also more welcoming here."}
{"text":"Holy f the beat steak of my life. Also the most expensive, but well worth it. I was with a large group of about 20 people, we ordered 3-4 different types of steak in groups of 3-4 so got to try a variety and compare and fall in love. Definitely the way to go. Please, treat yourself to this incredible experience."}
{"text":"Took my husband here when we were dating and two years later he still raves about it being the best steak he's ever had! 

DECOR I love that the look is sleek but still romantic enough to be a date spot. Yes, it's a bit stuffy, but the waiters are very humble and happy to explain the different cuts of steak and the sauces that go along with it. Not pretentious at all. 

TASTE I'm not a huge steak fan or meat fan in general, but I absolutely love love this place!"}
{"text":"Huge variety of steaks both local and international. Great quality and really nice selection of salts to try them with too. I've been trying different sides every time I go and have never gotten anything I didn't like yet. Just top quality food. The devote is posh but not overdone. I find it really relaxing and great for anything from groups to a fancy meal out for two. AND SERVICE! Possibly the best service I have ever gotten in Canada period. Would always recommend and is definitely my top choice for a luxurious meal in Toronto."}
{"text":"Best restaurant so far of our trip!

Recommended was the table side Caesar salad service sans the anchovies. They ground the pepper, yolk, & seasonings to perfection. The twist was a little bit of Tabasco and amazing bacon bits. 

We had the traditional filet that was seared perfectly, the lobster add on for $35, & sides of braided onion (first time ever), spinach (which was ok), and delicious potatos au gratin. 

Vibe was romantic but also good for big parties (fabulous huge booth seating.) We brought our own bottle since wine is always too marked up. Corkage fee per bottle is $50. Which is steep but whatever. 

Toronto is weird! Alcohol sales is very restricted and had to go to a specific store. It's not like the US where you can go to any corner to buy liquor. Beware! Sunday's are more of a heckle."}
{"text":"For my much delayed \"make-up\" birthday celebration last year (my birthday was in September, this dinner happened in December), my boyfriend was kind enough to take me to a rather expensive steakhouse. And when I say expensive, I mean this is probably the priciest place I've ever eaten at. 

Caesar salads are prepared at the table side. On this occasion, we didn't order one, so we simply admired from afar. 

To start, we were served popovers with a herb butter. The texture of the pastry resembled that of croissant, and I quite enjoyed it. 

We shared a lobster bisque as our appetizer. It wasn't as good as I had expect. Although it was rich and creamy, the lobster flavour wasn't as intense as I'd like it to be. The soup also could use a tad more salt.

For my steak, I chose a 6oz Canadian Prime Hereford-Lindsay Tenderloin, cooked to medium rare. It was phenomenal, and undoubtedly the best steak I've ever had in my life. The meat was incredibly tender and almost just melted in my mouth! I never knew that a piece of steak could be cooked so perfectly until I had this one. Suddenly, the Keg seemed so inadequate.

My boyfriend opted for an 8oz USDA Prime Black Angus-Nebraska, Aged 50 days California cut striploin. His steak was also cooked to a perfect medium, and he was also very impressed with the cookery of the steak.

To accompany our steak, we have a trio of salt and sauces: sea salt, hickory smoked salt, magnesium infused salt, blue cheese, chimichurri and a Japanese ponzu sauce. Didn't use much of the salt because the steak was already perfectly seasoned. With regards to the sauces, I favoured the chimichurri as it added a pleasant herbal dimension to the meat. My boyfriend's favourite was the Japanese ponzu sauce, which was slightly sweet.

Since we both got smaller cuts of meat, I also chose a side to supplement the meal- potato gratin with shallots and cheddar. I loved it! It was so irresistibly scrumptious with all that butter and fat! I definitely can't eat this everyday, but it was a great indulgence. 

I wasn't up for desserts after all that rich, fatty food. We were given two complimentary muffins to take home. I didn't end up trying any of it, but I was told that they were delicious as well. Overall, I had an unforgettable meal at Jacobs & Co., even though I felt like I totally didn't belong with the crowd. The food was absolutely fantastic, but I can't exactly say that it was worth every penny (it was, after all, very expensive). Nevertheless, I will definitely be coming back, but perhaps not for another 5 or 10 years or so."}
{"text":"We dined here with a big group of friends. The quality and various cuts of meats offered were beautiful and of very high quality, I had a Wagyu steak. The service level was also excellent.

My main complaint was that all of our food came lukewarm, from the sides to the steaks. Which was unacceptable. Within minutes my steak was room temperature. Everyone at our table commented on the same thing. The sides were very uninspiring and overpriced, the mashed potatoes were very pedestrian and the duck fat fries, asparagus, and mushroom sides were very salty. I felt the sides at some of the other high end steakhouses were a lot better. I had high expectations given the reputation/reviews & prices, but came away with a lukewarm feeling just like the temperatures of our steaks. I've had superb Wagyu steaks in Japan and this experience just didn't compare."}
{"text":"Everything was great, from service to the steaks. This is a personal preference, I find the steak to be over seasoned. A bit too salty for my taste."}
{"text":"At this restaurant, customer service is highly focused and they will do their best to accommodate you to your own personal preferences.  We decided to start our meal with the table side Caesar salad for two and this is highly recommended.  They will make it fresh right in front of you.  As well, they will go into detail about how they make it and why each ingredient is used.  I found this very interesting as I even asked them how/when the Caesar salad was created?  For drinks, we decide to go for the awarding winning Huff's Estate sparkling wine for the night; a very nice choice but yes, expensive (the theme for the night).

For an entree, I decided to get the 9oz Wagyu flatiron cooked medium rare with the duck fried fries.  The lady got an 8oz Prime Black Angus striploin also medium rare with the lobster tail side.  The Wagyu was nice and the flavour was extremely good.  However, maybe I was expecting too much as I was expecting it to be the best steak I have ever had.  Though it was definitely one of the better steaks, it wasn't a clear winner as the best.  The duck fried fries were interesting but I don't believe I will be ordering them again if I were to go again.  My girlfriend liked her striploin as it was marinated well and though tougher than the Wagyu, had a really nice flavour to it.  The lobster tail was simply disappointing.  So don't bother paying more for it.

The portions weren't bad at all throughout the night from appetizers to the entree.  The dessert menu is weaker than most fine dining restaurants and with us being stuffed, it was an easy pass.  We were given 2 little chocolate treats at end of our meal.  When the bill came we got 2 muffins as well which appeared to be baked on the very same day.  Overall, Jacobs was good.  I mean Jacobs is ranked as one of the top steakhouses in Toronto.  Service was great, the staff was knowledgeable and they worked really hard to make you feel comfortable and welcome.  But the kicker for me was for this price, I just expected a little more.  Maybe I simply just had high expectations of it and yes we had a great time, but the food wasn't 'that' much better than other notable steakhouses around Toronto.  To us, the sides besides the salad were a big drop off from the steak.  So unless you're going purely just for the salad and steak, you might come out a little disappointed when the bill comes.  Don't get me wrong though, I like Jacobs.  Just be prepared, a night at Jacobs is an expensive treat."}
{"text":"Ambiance - just enough contemporary touches without taking away from the classic steakhouse feel... The result was a much more energized yet rustically sooting dining environment.

Service - I must admit, I judged the servers before they started serving because they looked much less experienced and not your traditional steakhouse server (in other words - young and used moderate amounts of hair product), but they were very knowledgable and you could tell they had an appreciation for the finer points of a steakhouse (origin, feed, marbleization, etc). 

And the result (the food) - fantastic!! Impressive oysters, formidable wine pairings, and steaks galore.

Added points - I'm a business traveler, so it's always nice to be able to eat at the bar by yourself and not feel like you are being overrun by other patrons or ignored by the bartenders... Here I faced neither; in fact I experienced the opposite- very attentive service and plenty of room to take my time and enjoy my amazing steak

And if you're curious - I had local bone in ny strip (rare plus), oysters, cream brûlée, a martini, and wine... All perfect.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"After some careful Yelping, I decided to bring my lady here for her birthday this Sat past. It was a tough call to choose between Jacobs and Barbarians for must-try downtown steakhouse, and we settled on Jacobs simply for it's location.

We got there for an early-ish dinner, and were given a tip by the $20-dollar valet fella that let us park for free until 9. That was mighty descent of him.

When we arrived we were greeted by distinguished old English gent, who informed us that he was the Maître d', to our delight, he was efficient, good-humored, and flattering all the way to our table, like I imagine most stereotypical old English gents are...

For dinner, I ordered the prime rib, and my lady had the strip loin. They were each aged 42 days (which i've learned means that they become more flavourful)  They were both flawlessly cooked to our specifications. 3 different kinds of salts (regular, hickory and charcoal) were available at the table as well as blue cheese, some sort of spicy sauce, and a tangy sauce. The spicy one and the blue-cheese were delicious additions to my med cooked steak.

Ordered the duck fat fries too, as per all the recommendations. I gotta be honest, they were good, but that's about it. Maybe it's my horribly uncultured palate that can't detect the duck-fatty-ness on deep fried potatoes, maybe it's all hype. Anyways the fries were fine. Also got the spinach which was delicious and simple with olive oil, garlic and lemon.

We were very pleased with the meal, and had a modestly priced bottle of wine with it which brought the entire tab to close to $300 with tip. You might be able to eat for a bit less than than that if you scale back on the after-meal coffee, and the sides, but that's about as low as you could go. On the splurge side of things, the 20 page wine list was filled mostly with bottles $200 and up, so you wouldn't have any difficulty spending $2000 on a dinner for 2 if that's your thing.

Next birthday dinner, it's Barbarians, then I'll be able to compare. Till then, Jacobs' was a terrific experience all around."}
{"text":"This steak house is by far the best steakhouse I've ever been to. The steaks were across the board delicious, and the sides were to die for. The service was actually wonderful, Jay our server did a phenomenal job. We had a private party room and it was lovely. 

The only reason they don't get 5 stars is due to poor management. They don't split bills which makes paying the bill complicated. Their payment system unfortunately kept ignoring the gratuity which complicated out payment at the end. We paid the correct amount and tipped generosity, however, due to system issues we were delayed on exit to sort things out. I had to mathematically demonstrate that we'd both paid and tipped. This is highly unacceptable at a high end restaurant.

The burnt steak analogy applies. Imagine you eat the best steak of your life (and we did). Now imagine that the very last bite is burnt. What do you remember about that steak? You remember the burnt morsel. Unfortunately, poor management and/or systems metaphorically burnt the otherwise wonderful steak experience.

Advice to management, figure your system out and DO NOT aggregate your guests on check out, especially when you're in the wrong."}
{"text":"Although I am giving this restaurant 4 stars, I would reduce it to one star by the end of the meal. (See cake cutting issue below.)

Nice ambiance, good service.  Popovers were yummy, steaks were good but quite overpriced.  The sides were very large - enough for 4 - 6 guests to be honest.  Caesar salad was okay.  Nothing to write home about.

The wine list was extremely overpriced.  The mark-up was quite high and the options for wine was very limited in the lower price ranges.

We brought in a 6\" cake for my husband's birthday.  After spending almost $600 on dinner, it was embarrassing to see a $40 charge ($5 x 8 people) for providing us with plates and cutting the cake into 8 slices.

I have brought a cake to Harbor Sixty and was never charged a cutting fee.  Why Jacobs & Co. chooses to do so, I am not quite sure.  All I can say is that the addition of the $40 to my bill prevents me from EVER returning to this restaurant.  An establishment of this calibre should never behave in this manner."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time here last night to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. Rib eye, strip loin, half side of duck fat fries, half side of potato gratin and 4 popovers later and we're STUFFED. Both ordered the steaks medium & they were perfect. I love the sides of salts and sauces they give. I was definitely channeling my inner salt bae all night. 
The service is very attentive, my glass was never empty and the waiter didn't make me feel bad for ordering more popovers. 
My only regret is not asking for some extra popovers to take home with my muffins.
Definitely coming back. And the brownie is divine!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving it 2 stars because of the \"atmosphere\"

My friend and I are visiting from out of town and as we enter we get a vibe from the host / workers that we can't afford this place.

Just because I'm not dressed up like a frat douche leaving his 9-5 Job, doesn't mean I'm struggling to pay for a Premium steak.

By Premium, this place was horrible.

There was a guest sitting behind me who arrived at 9:30 and did not receive there food until 11:45. This is absolutely unacceptable.

The weird part is the 5 tables around our table all came on different times but everyone's food came out together. How does that make sense? It was a complete disaster. Not sure if it was a bad day or not but this place was horrible.

The steak was over cooked, dry and had no flavor. This was not a welcoming visit to Canada. I can't wait to have a real steak back home. Truly disappointed. Not only was the steak nasty, it was over priced!

Take your business else where."}
{"text":"As pricey as it is, it's worth the experience. We went here for my birthday and the everything lived up to our expectations. We're greeted at the front with smiles and taken to our table by, what we thought, was the manager for the night. He warmly shook my hand and wished me a very happy birthday. Definitely a good start to the night. Our server was very friendly and attentive. She explained the menu to us and advised that we could actually order the sides half-portion, which was not written on the menu. The complimentary bread was unlike anything I've ever seen before. Big and pouffy (like a giant muffin!) served with oregano and garlic butter spread. We started with the famous Jacobs' caesar salad, prepared table side. MUST TRY. The dressing was made from scratch, delicious! We added anchovy for an extra $3, which I wouldn't do again next time (too salty for my liking). For mains, my fiancee ordered the 70-day old striploin from Norfolk and I got the 65-day old ribeye from PEI. Both cooked to perfection and carved so they're easier to consume :) We got the duck fat fries and sauteed rapini as sides, which complemented the steaks really well. They also gave us 2 chocolate chip muffins to go, which is complimentary for every guest. We had these for breakfast the next day and they're still nice and moist :)

My only \"con\" with Jacobs is their pricey wine list. I'm not a wine connoisseur so I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a 2010 Merlot to a 2014 one. Their wine by the glass starts at $19 for 6oz. I would like to see a more affordable options for people like me who just wants to enjoy their steak with a glass of red.

Jacobs is definitely my favorite steakhouse in Toronto so far. I've tried Ruth Chris and Barbarian, Jacobs easily beats them both. HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS!"}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to try Jacobs and Co. recently and it's as good as it gets. As one of Toronto's best steakhouses you pay a steep price for the quality of beefs that are available (as well as the service...which is a huge part of the dining experience). The restaurant itself is on a side street near the bustle of King/Spadina. Upon entering you feel how upscale and classy the place is. I made reservations for my boyfriend and I a month in advance because we wanted to go somewhere special for Christmas dinner. We arrived 10 mins late but that was not a problem. We were quickly asked if we wanted to check our coats and seated. The restaurant itself was not full but I assume that is because they want to maintain the high quality of service it's customers receive.

We ordered two 9oz glasses of the Syrah from France and were given complimentary cheddar poppers. These poppers were amazing...piping hot and delicious (even without the butter). I refrained from eating all of mine just because I wanted to make sure I saved enough room for the main attraction (the steaks!). We also ordered a table side caesar to share which was great as well.

For the steaks, we shared two cuts of beef as well as 2 half sides (the duck fat french fried potatoes (which were delicious) as well as the roasted beefsteak tomatoes). We ordered a 18oz bone-in striploin from NE, USA as well as a 6oz tenderloin from Japan (A5 Black Tajima-Gunma Prefecture). You cannot come to this place and not get Wagyu from Japan. It is a must because the quality of the beef is absolutely delicious. With the two different cuts of meat from the different regions of the world, you can taste the difference in quality. The Wagyu from Japan was simply buttery and melt in your mouth while the US striploin had a tougher texture (in comparison). Both steaks were done to medium rare as we requested and the Syrah we had ordered complimented the meat very well. We were both satisfied and full that we did not even bother to order dessert. At the end of the meal we were given petit fours and 2 muffins to bring home. 

The service at Jacobs and Co is what you would expect from a high-end restaurant. The waiters are attentive and knowledgeable when questions are asked. Tables are wiped after every course and water/wine is refilled if need be (without asking). The staff working there will move out of your way when you are walking past them to make sure you feel important and catered to. I would expect nothing less from a high end restaurant and Jacobs and Co delivered. Great experience overall and my boyfriend and I left feeling satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"I came here with last night excited to try the various steaks on the menu. It was a work event and the waiter mentioned sharing was common so we got a few of the Canadian tenderloins, a 34oz ribeye and the Australian Wagyu. It was a mistake to start with the Wagyu first because none of the steaks after could hold its weight against the butteriness of the Wagyu. It was delicious. 

We also got the Caesar salad and duck fat fries as well as a few greens. The asparagus was quite good. I finished everything off with chocolate cream pie which was decent.

I definitely recommend coming here. The ambiance was terrific as they had a live piano player and it was a great place to chat as it didn't have the usual noise of a packed restaurant."}
{"text":"I declare Jacob's my favourite Steakhouse! We made reservations for Saturday night at 9pm. Upon entering the hostess kindly greeted us and then an elderly male hostess or perhaps he was the manager came out to greet us. He asked if were celebrating anything special and I told him it was my birthday and he kissed my hand. He took us on tour through out the restaurant highlighting the lounge, piano bar, and up to the meat cellar and then the main dining room which is located up stairs. When we got upstairs he let us pick which table we wanted to sit at.I chose a cozy table at the end of the banquet.

I love the atmosphere in here, everything is cast in a gold glow, it feels very romantic and intimate yet if you take a look around it feels very energetic depending on where your eyes land. There was a table of middle aged women drinking wine and giggling, a group of men celebrating a bachelor party, couples ranging in ages from mid 20's to retirement, just a really good assortment of people.

Our waiter came over to greet us and take our drink order. He was soo funny and very delightful all evening long.

We started the evening off with two delicious glass of champagne. Next our waiter brought over two giant popovers fresh out of the oven. I absolutely loved them! Flaky buttery crust served with a garlic herb butter, these alone would have me coming back!

For mains we both went the 6oz Canadian Prime Hereford-Lindsay Tenderloin.
First of all I've eaten a great share of steaks but this steak by far blows all the competition out of the water! Cooked perfectly medium rare with a delicious seared crust, every tender slice of meat literally melted in my mouth! Just a to die for steak!

For our veg side we chose the Sautéed Spinach w/ lemon, garlic, olive oil
Nice garlicky taste pleasantly balanced with the acidity of the lemon

As a starch side I of course had to order the Duck Fat French Fried Potatoes.
Golden brown perfectly seasoned and you can definitely taste the duck fat which I absolutely adored. I even asked for some ketchup which they brought me out in a little ceramic container. Definitely a must try.

Finally if I wasn't already over stuffed from our rich and decadent meal our waiter brings over the dessert menu. Since it is my birthday and who am I kidding I can never resist desserts anyhow!

Flourless Chocolate Cake - w/ espresso ice cream & candied hazelnuts
This cake has my had name written all over it! Boy did I ever enjoy it! Warm fudgey gooey semi sweet chocolate oozing out the of the cake paired with that delicious creamy espresso ice cream and crunchy hazelnuts. I just loved the hot & cold plus the coffee & chocolate combination. I savoured every mouthful. 

By the end of this meal I had transformed from food comma into a sugar comma.
Every aspect of Jacob was spot on! Service was amazing from the time you walk in the front door, waiters checking on tables and refilling glasses as if on cue, exceptional food coming out perfectly timed, and an atmosphere that makes you want to chill out all evening long. Do yourself a favour and come to Jacob's to see fine dining at it's Best and to learn what steak should actually taste like!"}

Ambiance ****

This place lives up to the hype.   We started with drinks at the bar and then moved to our table.   We had caesar salads as apps steaks + sides for the main course.  The Wagyu was by far the best steak I've ever eaten.   I'm exited to go back. 

The waitstaff treat you like royalty.  When you ask where the washroom is the take you there.  When you pass them in the hall/stairs, the stop and turn to the side and wait for you to pass.   They ask you for your valet ticket when you ask for the bill so your car is waiting for you.  Small details but it shows and makes a difference.  Bravo!

Appetizer:
Caesar - ***
- Prepared tableside, this salad is a staple of the restaurant.   I thought it was great but not amazing.  I've had better before - which surprised me. 

Mains
A5 Wagyu *****
- This was as delicious as everyone describes it.  Its very rich, so if you get it as a main, get a small portion.  We got a couple for the table to split.
- It is so tender you can cut it with a spoon.   Do not get it done anything more than medium rare!
- Make sure you get a red wine that pairs well with it...
USDA Ribeye Black Angus****
- Also a delicious steak however after trying the wagyu, this top tier steak became decent.  I

Sides:
Mushrooms ****
Asparagus ****
