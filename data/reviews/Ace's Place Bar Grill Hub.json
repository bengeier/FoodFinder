{"text":"Tried out this place recently and ordered the wing it Wednesday special.  Arthur style is their unique way of doing the wings and they were actually quite good.    It was very busy this particular Wednesday night.  My one complaint was the service   The server was an air head.  She brought the wrong drinks the wrong food and literally left our table ignored for so long I actually had to go to the bar to order another round of drinks.   The owner was very nice  he came around to our table an brought a complimentary piece of cheesecake.   Nice little neighbourhood pub. Warm and entitling environment and the decor is very nice. Obviously newly renovated.    Worth checking out."}
{"text":"This was the worst service we have ever had! The waitress was more interested in talking to her friends at the next table than doing her job. We even had to flag down a busboy for more water! The only time she was attentive was when she brought the bill and expecting a big tip.  It took 25 minutes just to get our appetizers!  The food was not very good either. The mushroom soup had no flavour and the potato skins were bland. The t-bone steak was so thin it was a joke, the beef dip sandwich had no flavour either. The nachos were good and the roast beef with York shire pudding was also good.   Overall a very bad dinner experience. Would not go back if asked to."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a place in Guildwood that we can walk to and from. The food had always been good and the decor very inviting. My only negative comment is with the service; During peak times, Ace's is seriously understaffed."}
{"text":"I've visited this place a few times with my friend and the food has consistently gotten better and better! I especially enjoy the chicken caesar wrap which was totally awesome and recently tried the pulled pork wrap that they featured for the evening which blew me away! They have a big selection of items that look and sound equally amazing. I also tried the cheese cake, which is homemade and delicious, they serve it with in season fruit compotes, I had it with peach and it was fantastic. I'm at risk of going there everyday just for the cheese cake!  The portions are respectable and this restaurant really has a home-y vibe. It is very casual and seems to attract many locals because of the good food and company.   I will be honest, in some instances the service can be a little slow, but if you're with good company you hardly notice and your food always comes out quickly and hot.   I really do love this place and cannot wait to bring more of my friends and family because it is definitely a hidden gem of the scarborough area. I would recommend this place to anyone who is tired of the typical bar& grill fast food chain restaurants, Ace's Place is so much better!"}
{"text":"I recently held a memorial service at Ace's Place and everything was fantastic and I couldn't of been more pleased! I mainly dealt with Jane and Wendy. Their guidance, knowledge and kindness really helped make this the special day I had wanted it to be. All the staff did such a great job not only with the setup, food, drinks and service but also with helping plan and offer up ideas to make this day memorable. The food was amazing! We ordered platters of chicken wings, spring rolls and  a vegetable platter. The chicken wings were enormous and of course delicious!(this is their signature dish and make sure to order them \"Arthur style\") The spring rolls were crisp and filled to the brim and bursting with filling! And the veggie platter came with a great assortment and a yummy dill dipping sauce.  They had a nice selection of wines and beers for guests to order from and offered up the fantastic idea of having a toast at a certain point and lining up bottles of beer along the bar and inviting each guest to grab a bottle and toast and drink all at the same point. It was a perfect idea.  Just can't say enough nice things. I encourage everyone to go to Aces's and see for themselves what all the hype is about :)"}
{"text":"Short review for now.   I was surprised, pleasantly, when we came in.  The atmosphere is both upscale and relaxed. You will feel comfortable in jeans and a suit.   The service was excellent. I will leave it at that for now.   The food was good. It wasn't earth shattering but for the price it was just right. I enjoyed the wings which is a good sign.   My one negative is the napkins - cheap paper. And for that to be the only negative is saying something.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Service, atmosphere, beer selection and owner are great.  The menu could be improved, a few of items are a bit too greasy and salty i.e. Nachos, fries, soups."}
{"text":"I came here last night with the family to have a birthday dinner for my dad. There were 5 of us in total so when we arrived we had to grab a table and add it on the another set to accommodate us since we are supposed to seat ourselves. We sat down and most of our night was spent waiting and then waiting some more.   We were told that they were short staffed because the bartender called in so there were only two people trying to take care of the whole front end of things. Unfortunately, that was not our problem and it's bad for business.  We had to wait at least 15 minutes just to get a menu and never even received a drink menu. This caused a problem when I asked for what was available in a sauvignon blanc. I was recommended what I thought would be an average priced option, but when I got the bill it turned out to be $16.40 for a 9oz glass. Also when I first received my glass of wine it was closer to 5oz than 9 oz so I had to ask for the difference. My dad also mentioned that his beer was a little flat.  When we put in our drink order, even that took much longer than it should to receive one pint, one glass of wine and three waters. Finally our server came to tell us the specials for the day and we couldn't risk having to wait any longer so we just ordered right away. This also failed as my dad had ordered a full rack of ribs and 15-20 minutes later we were told that they had run out. In my opinion, they should have been aware of this before my dad even ordered.  As for the food, everyone seemed satisfied with their meals once we finally got them. The liver was cooked perfectly to a medium finish. The parmesan crusted chicken and the lemon chicken were both good, but we felt the portion size was rather small. The beef bourguignon that my dad ordered as a replacement was fine, but he had also had it from here before. The caesar salad looked and was better than the sandwich my brother ordered.  We also asked if we could get a dessert in celebration of my Dad's birthday so we got a chocolate lava cake for him on the house so that was nice.   This place is lucky that it's the only sit down restaurant in the plaza, but even so we won't be returning again. I will mention that our server Emma was working really hard to make the best of the situation. I do, however, think it is a bit overpriced for what it is. I would also recommend getting better menus than the paper ones they currently use. If the food wasn't half decent, this place would have gotten a 1 star review from me."}
{"text":"I'll get right to it:  Things I liked: The decor (nice neighbourhood pub) The food (I had wings and fries, wings were big, tender and juicy for the most part and fries were tasty) The owner (Arthur - very nice guy) The beer list (good selection of domestics and a few nice imports - perfect for this kind of place) The tall glass of water (might just be me but I hate when I ask for water somewhere and it's served in something not much larger than a shot glass) The after meal candies (1 fruit, 1 caramel) The generosity with napkins and wetnaps (they use the nice big towelly ones too)  Things that should change: The food (wings were good but slightly overcooked when done \"Arthur Style\" aka grilled, also suicide sauce is not nearly hot enough and the wings could use more sauce) The $1 surcharge for an extra side of ranch dip, especially since the size is quite small (come on guys, how much does this really cost you?) The service (both waitresses were decent at their jobs but didn't smile once between the two of them and were at times not rude but definitely overly aggressive with questions)  It could easily get a 4 if they correct these issues, especially since Arthur is a cool old guy and I like that he is bringing some quality to the neighbourhood. Also they ask on their menu what the guest would like to see on there, presumably because they are new and still shaping the menu. Their menu so far is small but makes sense and everything seems like at least decent quality. I would recommend they add some more niche pub items i.e. an all day breakfast, a scotch egg, stew, chili, pies, maybe some variation on a ploughman's lunch."}
{"text":"Went for lunch there today, having previously perused the menu, but found that the prices were too high for what we received.  For $10.99 the fish & chips consisted of one small triangle of fish (similar to the ones in a Highliner box), a small portion of fries and an even smaller portion of coleslaw. We decided we would not go back to eat there."}
{"text":"Arthur and Jane have brought to Guildwood something that  was truly missing, a beautiful restaurant with community spirit, and delicious, affordable food. The decor is modern, fresh and inviting! The wings on Wednesday are grilled and delicious, and my favourite is Sunday night prime rib au jus, with Yorkshire pudding. The mashed potatoes are fluffy and real, and the freshly steamed veggies are served al dante. I usually go for an early dinner (before the rush), and the staff make every effort to give our party a quiet table. I will always remember the rainy evening that Arthur accompanied my friend and me with an umbrella, to our car to save us getting rained on. He and his wife Jane know the true meaning of hospitality, and that would probably account for their stellar popularity in our community!"}
{"text":"Aces is a  Little Gem  In Guildwood The food is fabulous  especially the wings every week the menu is changed up really love the curry chicken the club sandwich is the best I've ever had a great beer selection is amazing Scarborough has been missing a little place like this for a long time and now we have it!!!!"}
{"text":"It was the first time I visited the restaurant, and was very surprised with the establishment. Nicely decorated, and wonderful food at a reasonable price. Well worth going back again."}
{"text":"First time here. We're new to the village, but this is a greAt find. Nestled into the plaza you may pass by and not even see it, but what a shame! Owners are reportedly 25 year residents of the village. Menu is seasonally dynamic, and very interesting. Went there to satisfy a wife pregnancy craving via take out, but eager to try more!"}
{"text":"Went there Saturday night.  Has a great time.  The rack of lamb was perfectly cooked, well presented and delicious.  (Compliments to the chef). Great selection of beers.  Had a boddington and a smithwicks.  Reasonably priced for the quality.  Good, attentive and efficient service, even though the place was full.  Great neighbourhood place.  Really glad we found it.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I wish this place was closer to my house!  I enjoy the atmosphere and the menu is different than most of the restaurants in Scarborough.  I am currently working my way through the menu.  My faves so far are the large and interesting salads and the wings.  Keep up the good work! PS to the owner: Add a Ploughmans lunch to the menu and you will have me hooked for life!"}
{"text":"Terribly slow and poor service this evening.  We sat ourselves and ordered quickly (the waitress wanted to get our order in before the table of 6 next to us).  That was useless as they got their food before us.  The owner (Jane) brought our food over and I said to her 'why did this table of 6 get their food before us and when we ordered before them?\" Her reply \" You see how busy we are in here right?\"  Then she said \"Well we use different machinery to cook the food\" and I said \"But the lady at the table of 6 had the same thing I did\"  and she walked away.   My drink sat empty with no offer to refill, my dining companion got no wet naps with his wings and when I told the waitress she shrugged and said \"That's the owner.\"  We could be regulars as we live in the neighborhood but we will pass.  Even worse, the last time we were in Arthur came over and introduced himself & talked to us.....completely different tonight.  Advice: Lose the attitude.  Food subpar at best by the way.....I had a burger, I didn't even finish it."}
{"text":"I took my two kids there for lunch: we were the first group of customers. My son has special needs and uses his iPad for communications. The waitress took the time to wait for my kids and allowed them to order. It is a great chance for my son to practice ordering his meal in real life. I really appreciate it.  The food was surprisingly good: I thought it was one of those mom-and-pa joint when others mentioned it is in a mall. But it is classy and ribs, beef sliders and chicken club sandwich were great! My son chewed the ribs to the bone!  As we were sitting there, there were more and more customers showing up. I will definitely go there again and will make sure we are the first ones arrive!"}
{"text":"Man, this place is a gem in the plaza right beside where I live. I'm really shocked I didn't try this place earlier! I guess with my obvious Toronto absence, I needed to get out more -- I'm glad my mother recommended this place to me.  I'll go through some pros/cons, which ultimately results in this place getting a solid 4/5 (I'll explain why afterwards).  Pros: - GREAT selection of beer, wine, and hard liquor. - Amazing atmosphere - there are six massive TVs displaying different things; and you can request for specific TVs to change to specific programs (I watched the last part of the Toronto/Detroit basketball game on Jan 25th) - Kids meals & seniors discount, as well as Wednesday Wing discount ($7.99/lb) - Lots of bar seating, as well as group tables and high/low tables (you can be seated pretty much anywhere). - Newly renovated - the place really feels like a quaint restaurant / bar. - CLEAN. You won't believe how great this place looks, even if I were to try to explain it to you. - Presentation of food (and beer) is impeccable - I felt like I was being served quality food dishes, because of just how appetizing it looked. See: my picture for details. - Great location - this place is smack dab in the middle of the main Guildwood plaza - surrounded by a variety of fast food places, this place is the clear winner for overall atmosphere and style. - Homely music selections - I felt like I was living in my childhood when I listening to the tunes here - it was a great sound experience; I'm really excited to try to attend one of their events where they use the sound for the TVs, for something like the Super Bowl!  Cons: - No beer/alcohol or dessert menu. Having to ask for the prices of desserts / pintsis a little bit annoying to me, but that's only personal preference - I like having all of the numbers in front of me. - Dinner menu is only one double-sided piece of paper (so not amazing variety, but there's at least different things people can order), and then another one-sided sheet of paper with other options on it. - Desserts: There are three. Lava cake with ice cream, cheesecake with ice cream, or ice cream with chocolate sauce on top. - Food portions are actually a little small for the cost. I'm not necessarily complaining - this is an observation I've made based on the $34 I spent (after tax/tip) on: a pint of Rolling Rock, Beef Bourgignon, and ice cream dessert. Not terrible I guess, but it's not something I could list as a \"pro\". - Sweet potato fries upgrade is $1.99 on most combinations. :(  The main reason I'm giving this place a 4/5 is because of the lack of options. I think this place has awesome potential for me to edit it to be a 5, if and when they introduce more variety in food options (they are, slowly - I had the newly minted beef bourgignon, which was quite good), as well as a dessert menu. The craft beer selection and the overall experience put me in a solidly great frame of mind, and the owner and his wife are very courteous and very friendly.   I'm definitely coming back here again - it's not often you find a place as good as this so close to home!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, food, and bar selection!! I'm glad I found a nice place in Guildwood!! There aren't enough of those. Every single meal I've eaten here was perfectly prepared and got to me in a short amount of time. They have a great selection of beer for both the local and import lovers. It's a great place for friends and groups, and it's a perfect hangout place for anyone who loves sports! I love all the golf decor around too!  Overall one of the best places to grab a bite and pint in all of Guildwood! Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food is ok but the service is extremely slow. I went there with a friend and we had to wait about 15 minutes before the server even brought a menu. When she came back we de iced to order everything at once because service was so slow. The restaurant wasn't even that busy so I don't know what the problem was. The menus are just photocopies on ratty paper and seem kind of amateurish. They really should invest in a more professional looking menu. Unfortunately their dessert selection is very minimum, lava cake, cheesecake or ice cream. Not very exciting. We went to the tearoom around the corner for dessert after dinner"}
{"text":"The woman who serves me whom I assume is the owner's wife (Woman in her 60s with shoulder length light brown hair and wears glasses, receipt says Jane) is rather an odd ball.  She doesn't smile the whole time, like as if she was scared of me, I'm not scary, I smiled 100% of the time and I'm really a nice guy if you got to know me.  She doesn't look at me when she serves my food.  I had the cajun wings and blue cheese dip.  Dip was only filled half way dude, come on !  Wings were good though, however left to cook just a bit too long to be crispy and hard but that's my preference though.  I clean of the edges of my wings good.  Will I come back?  I don't think so, not for awhile at least.  I would've given 4 stars if she was more friendly and gave small talk like the weather or city issues or something.  Plus if the dip was filled more correctly.  Being a nice guy I gave a $3.50 tip and since this didn't really satisfy me, I went on to bar hop to another bar.  To hear more of what happens at the next bar, stay tuned for my book! Just kidding hahaha"}
{"text":"I've had lunch and dinner at Ace's about  A dozen times now and the food has always been good and carefully prepared.  The fare is very pub by and there are plenty of sports on the many TVs.  It's a nice modern clean environment.  The problem is that the last 4 or 5 times I have visited they always seem to be short staffed and the wait staff are stressed and error prone.  They never seem to write orders down.  Almost every order gets slightly mixed up.  Today the waitress rushed by 3 times asking if we wanted menus before bringing them over.  Then when I asked for the wifi password she said that it had just been changed and she didn't know it.  She ran off and didn't offer to find it.  My wife and I could feel the stress and decided to head on up the street the the Old Stone Cottage - much friendlier."}
{"text":"We were very happy to see a high quality place open up right here in the Guild! The menu was more sophisticated than expected, and the food was excellent."}
