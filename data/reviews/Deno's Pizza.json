{"text":"Been going here for years because my wife seems to like ketchup topped matzo with way too much cheese.  They have always had bad service, but this last (and final time) was the worst.  The kid, who seems to charge something different every time, even though we always order the same thing takes my order.  He repeats the wrong order back to me, and I correct him.  When I get back home low and behold we have the wrong pie.  Well I call up expecting them to make a new pizza or at least make the half they got wrong in a smaller size.  I get crickets.  The kid says I should have told him when he repeated the order back to me.  I explained that is what happened and he thinks I am lying to him.  Trying to remind him that I order there all the time does nothing for this kid.  My wife has to be the only regular this place has I have never seen anyone in there besides this kid and the owner.  I ask him to contact the owner and see what he thinks they should do.

After a while on hold it turns out I am out of luck on this pie, and I will have to get \"a deal\" on my next one.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  My wife won't eat this thing you made it wrong.  And like I said its for her because I hate this place. 

In the end I am going to have to cancel the credit card purchase and battle it out there.  This place is a joke and can't even make a good pie!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Surprise in December and there are quite a few pizza joints in the area aside from your typical pizza chains. I've tried a few including Lucky's and Little Sicily, but this was my first time trying Deno's. I ordered a large half meat lovers half sausage and mushroom. Left to go next door for a bit then came back. My order was hot and ready and the staff gave it to me with a smile. I asked for cheese and peppers and there was no hesitation to accommodate my additional last minute request. They always asked if I needed anything else just to make sure. The price for my pizza was about $20, I had purchased a drink as well. This does seem a bit pricier than I would have expected but when I got home and did a taste test, I was a happy camper. MY mother is from Chicago and she loved the thin crispy crust, and she said the sausage tastes home made. The cheese is real mozzarella and isnt rubbery or look like platic (yes, ive had this happen with other places) and the sauce is really good, not too acidic. I saved their menu flyer on my fridge and this will definitely be our neighborhood go-to pizza joint. Great staff, amazing pizza, affordable, and close to home. Couldn't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"We ordered a large with spinach, mushroom and anchovies. And all I can say is bland cracker crust, bland sauce, bland spinach and mushrooms. the only good thing about it were the anchovies ( not super salty like a lot other places). I wont be ordering from Deno's again."}
{"text":"Guarantee this place will be out of business within a few years.terrible quality and a very expensive price."}
{"text":"I am not sure where this place is, since a buddy just dragged me here.  I am from Denver.  Anyway, this is great pizza.  We had a X Large sausage, peppers and onions and a large plain.  Cut in squares (apparently Chicago style).  According to my friend they fly in all the ingredients from the Windy City and also have great sandwiches.  If you live in the area, this is a good hole in the wall and you should frequent.  Or at least, give it a shot."}
{"text":"Best Pizza!!!!!  I have been a customer for about 18 years. This is the best pizza around.
The Sausage is plentiful and good. If you are from Chicago and appreciate a good pizza this  
place is for you. Restaurant is clean and service is good. John is the Best!!!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best Chicago style thin crust in the west valley. Just like your local Chicago pizza joint and if we are going to splurge on pizza, we call Denos. The sauce is great and they've nailed the crust. The cheese sticks are also great. Definitely a hidden gem of a place."}
{"text":"Went to Deno's because we saw a feature on a local Phoenix station that mentioned restaurants with a perfect  rating after health inspection. Deno's was one of them. I thought that anybody that would pay that much attention to cleanliness would pay attention to other areas. I was right. We had a very good pizza that was loaded with toppings. Good crust and good toppings. It might even be a five star."}
{"text":"Very good thin crust pizza.  Great toppings and a lot of cheese.  Friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm just came in from Vegas to Phoenix for the day and notice this pizza place so I give it a try. Order 10 wings hot and a 10 inch pizza sausage and pepperoni both items were good the establishments very clean coworkers are very nice and friendly if we come back down to Phoenix we would stop back in. The pizza is Chicago style thin crust."}
{"text":"This is not good food, too much sauce and not good sauce (sour - so not fresh)."}
{"text":"Needed dinner in a hurry... Can always count on great tasting pizza from Deno's. Tried their wings for the first time, we had BBQ and Hot the flavors were amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome Chicago pizza (squares are the best) and friendly people! This is our go to spot. We often order take out and go home and watch our Chicago sports teams and eat a good Chicago style meal."}
{"text":"Best pizza! My absolute favorite. This is a family owned place!! Wish there were more, but I will drive to surprise in a heartbeat for this pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Staff seems to be less friendly than previously remember.  I love their crust.  Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"We noticed this place hidden in the plaza a while ago, and finely gave it a try.   We've been trying to try all of the mom and pop pizza place in town to find our favorite.   
We ordered a Jumbo Pepperoni pizza and a large Deno's Alfredo Pizza.   
Pepperoni pizza was good.   Cut into squares, which isn't my favorite cut.  But it was thin crust and had lots of cheese.   Was delicious.    
The Deno's Alfredo pizza was not so good.   It had canned mushrooms and canned spinach on it.  The chicken did not seem home cooked.  And hardly any Alfredo sauce on it, so wasn't able to get a taste for the alfredo.  Definitely was not good.  And was very disappointed in the Alfredo pizza.   I feel like we wasted our money on that for sure.    I've had lean cuisine pizzas that tasted better than that."}
{"text":"Loyalty works both ways.  This owner does not care about it's customers...so disappointing!

I would really love to give this pizza place 5 stars as the food is very good, however my experience as a consumer tonight was a complete deal breaker. I used to be a loyal customer, until today. 

I am from Chicago and moved here a year ago. My parents are from Chicago and have lived near Deno's for the entire time that Deno's has been in business. We have been loyal Deno's pizza consumers, until today.

6 of us from the area went to Deno's for pizza. The 6 of us ordered 4 pizza's (one pizza was pepperoni and onion and one was gluten free - the other two standard pizzas) and a meatball sandwich. 3 pizzas came out in 20 minutes and it took a bit longer for the sandwich. The pepperoni/onion pizza never came, however the table behind us received their pizza when we had ordered before them. About 10 minutes later the server tried to deliver us a ham/pineapple pizza in lieu of our pepperoni/onion. We then discovered that the table behind us received our pepperoni/onion pizza in error and those people already ate half of the pizza. So that couple were given their ham/pineapple pizza in a box to enjoy at home and the server promised to re-make our lost pizza. In the meantime, we gave the person who ordered the lost pizza, pieces of the other 3 pizzas. When the lost pizza was finally replaced, we requested that it be put in a box because it had now been 30 minutes after our original pizzas came and we were all finished eating. We politely requested the server to ask the owner if we could have a justified refund for the lost 10\" pizza given that the other table was served our pizza in error. The server agreed to find out and came back indicating that a refund would be given, we just had to go to the counter and receive it.

So, when we were ready to leave, we approached the counter for our refund. They refunded our money to us for the lost pizza and then DEMANDED WE RETURN THE LOST PIZZA IN THE BOX in order to get our refund. Return the pizza? What are you going to do with it? You rewarded the people who got OUR pizza with a second pizza and those of us that you erred had to give back the duplicate pizza in order to get our money back? You have GOT TO BE KIDDING! Such a terrible way to run your business. We would have rather had all our pizzas delivered correctly and enjoyed a nice dinner, not have to supplement a diner because of YOUR error.

We have all made a pact to NEVER use this pizza place again. What business behaves that way? It's very disappointing. We had such a great connection until today. If you get the wrong thing, just eat it and you will still get your original order. Not get your order, just swallow your lost money and stop for a sandwich on your way home."}
{"text":"I'm giving four stars because I never give five.  We normally get a take & bake from Papa Murphys.  Our neighbors came over on Saturday and suggested Deno's Pizza.  I had never tried it before so we ordered a large sausage,  pepperoni and mushrooms.   
I went to pick it up in about 20 min, and I swear the pizza weighed about 5 lbs!
But I'm exaggerating.   It was very heavy though.
This is by far THE BEST pizza I've eaten in the Phoenix area to date and I've lived here on the NW side for 11 years!
We WILL be back! Love it."}
{"text":"Came from California to visit my parents and someone recommended this pizza place to me. I have not tasted such a delicious/satisfying pizza like Deno's. I truly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for an authentic pizza"}
{"text":"The pizza was really big and there were plenty of topping (especially sausage), but I prefer more sauce and a crispier crust. Just a little bland for my taste, but the rest of the family really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza and I usually don't like the thin crust. My husband and his family love the Chicago style beef sandwiches. We ate there last year and could wait to go back this year since we are out of state."}
{"text":"After an friend of mine talked about great pizza on the Westside, he told me about Deno's. I was excited. Forgetting about that I had to drive 20 minutes, we had to try. First time, pizza was very good, wings, ok, sauced missed on some of the wings.. no worries. Which leads me to today. Ordered two pizzas, no wings for carry out. After being told our pizzas would be finished in 20 minutes, my wife drive to pick up. After an  HOUR later, I called my wife. She was told management,  NICK told her it would be done soon because they gave our pizza away to someone else. So, NICK made a second pizza as my first pizza sat cold. Did management make anything right to their customers? I called and talked to the phone gal and asked to speak to the manger. After talking to the manager for 30 seconds, he hung up the phone me.  I called back a second time asking him why he hung up the phone on me and he said said, I don't want to be berated. Huh? For what, no cussing, no yelling, berated. Good luck to the owner and all. I never write these posts, but after the last two experiences, forget it.

{"text":"The people who say \"just another...\", stay away and go to Pizza Hut!
The best that reminds me of back home Chicago thin crust. I come here once a week to get my fix. 
They don't serve alcohol but you sure can bring in a cooler, I've seen it."}
{"text":"This is another Surprise pizza joint that I haven't been to in many years. Unlike Lucky's, the last time I had gone here I don't recall disliking the pizza. Today I was thinking I wanted a pizza that wasn't from one of the \"Papa Jominos\" chains. I first thought of hitting up Little Sicily. But that place, stupidly, is closed on Sundays. I remembered that Deno's was around the corner, and hooray, they were open.

Went inside, and was initially blown away by how expensive the pizzas were (a jumbo thin crust with four toppings was $28 after tax - come on!), and the wife got the shits with me when I decided to order anyway. Counter girl quoted a 20-25 minute wait, but it was only about 10-15 before the pizza arrived. Very large box, containing a pizza with a wafer thin crust. I live five minutes away. The pizza was placed at a VERY slight angle on the back seat. Here's what the pizza looked like when I got it inside (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/denos-pizza-surprise?select=iJ3lhOR7kKsDfVbDgrXtLA#iJ3lhOR7kKsDfVbDgrXtLA). They've gone and done the square cut on it. Hooray for incredibly uneven slices. I wrestled a few pieces on to my paper plate, since a paper plate seemed fairly fitting for the meal. Here's a picture (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/denos-pizza-surprise?select=M8UY7SRc1Ej3Oan6pEG7Gg). Finally, I took a bite. It actually didn't taste that bad. Not nearly as horrible as Lucky's, although about 1/10th the actual amount of food. Quality over quantity, I was thinking to myself, until I saw something that guarantees I won't be returning (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/denos-pizza-surprise?select=onJJk_sYQ4L7NlU_P0iLMg). Canned f-king champignon mushrooms. AGAIN! What the hell do places like this and Lucky's think they're playing at serving tinned mushrooms on a supposedly fresh pizza? My god.

Summary? A ten buck pizza for almost thirty. I KNEW I should have gone with Ray's, or even got a cold Costco deal to heat up at home. Canned mushrooms, my codpiece. (throws pizza box in air furiously, and watches it land on the garage roof)"}
{"text":"Its definatly a hole in the wall kind of place but food is yummy but it is a  BYOB kind of place"}
{"text":"Deno's can never get an order correct!!!  We ordered Wings with extra sauce because their wings are dry.  Ist time we ordered they came dry no extra sauce. The pizza they forgot the mushrooms manager didn't believe us said he made the pizza himself.  He brought a new order out to us himself.  When he got here he was sursprised no mushrooms and dry wings.  Wow how did that happen?  Apologized that the order was wrong. Decided to try again.  2nd time again asked for extra sauce on wings etra sauce on pizza and an order of cheese garlic bread.  Husband gets home with order.  No sauce for wings dry, no extra sauce on pizza and no cheese on garlic bread.  Call to to tell them and they argued with me again.  WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN!!!  NO WONDER THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE PLACE AT 5:30 ON A FRIDAY!"}
{"text":"I spotted this place on a bike ride & decided to try it out:) I didn't look up what time they opened & showed up about half hour before they opened up:) The owner noticed me & my friend outside & opened early! We couldn't decide on a pizza to share so we each ordered a baby extra small:) The ingredients were fresh & bountiful. I hope this hole in the wall stays a Litchfield Park Staple."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the West Valley.  As good as Chicago pizza"}
{"text":"Took my family here for family night. It truly is a hidden treasure in surprise. Affordable and homestyle pizza. The thin crust pizza lovers and garlic bread are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"It was better then I expected, 
Wife and myself was out looking for a place to have dinner. Drove by a couple of places and they were just to crowded.Now of course the old saying is, if the restaurant if full and another place is not. What plate do you think will have good food!
Deno's was half full, we still decided to go in and have dinner, I was hungry and didn't care. We ordered a large pepperoni and green pepper pizza, we also added a meatball sandwich.
Order came out at a reasonable time, food was very hot, so you need to give it time to cool down. 
I was first skeptical if the crust was bread or actually dough?  But after having a slice I realized it was dough. The pizza sauce was amazing, I had a hard time at first about the pepperoni. It didn't looked fully cooked, especially since we requested the pizza to be well done. However it was really good, The meatball sandwich was great, bread does get soggy and the end.
Overall, very surprised how good it was. Place is a little small, not your normal type of restaurant, Still a nice place to have a pizza."}
{"text":"Sorry, folks...this is another Peoria/Surprise/Glendale pizza place I can take off my list.  Went there tonight - eat in - ordered a pepperoni & onion pizza.  I should have been concerned when it arrived and the pieces wouldn't break apart - with a kitchen knife and fork we were just barely able to cut them apart.  First bite...the crust was doughy and chewy and tasted strongly of flour.
Long story short, the girl asked how things were, as she saw us eating the toppings and leaving the crust.  We told her of the crust and her response was \"Sorry.\"  I can't explain the 5 stars vs my one star, all I know is what the pizza was tonight.  Never, ever, again."}
{"text":"Loved the sauce on the pizza, wings were amazing. Would have liked a little thicker crust or not as crisp. The service was good, place clean & people friendly"}
{"text":"Great place with really good Chicago pizza. Owners are from Chicago. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! Chicago style!! Good thin crust Good cut in squares like back home good sauce and cheese. Best pizza in the west valley!! Small hole in the wall, no AC in there I think, had to call and ask where the hell it was, I passed it 3 times but was dark out lol I drove from near PIR race track and was well worth it!! It was great and will go here few times a month I bet! A must try and not to far from sox spring training for Chicagoans to get some descent pizza!"}
{"text":"I tried this place based on online reviews and recommendations, the first time I went was a Saturday early evening for an order to be picked up. When I arrived, the smells told me this was gonna be a good pizza! I drove the 15 min home and it was still hot and fresh and tasted delicious!  I was very excited because our reg go to pizza joint has really been declining the past few years, also a Chicago place btw....Well went back tonight for round two and when I got there it was a totally different staff, much younger it seemed, nobody seemed to thrilled to be there. Bad sign that my food was already completed and sitting waiting for me even though I got there early. When I got home it was a totally different experience, and not a good one. Food was cold, seemed undercooked and rushed, very dissapointing to say the least. I would try it again if I knew which night to order with the better crew working. Bummer."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt my Favorite pizza place in the Surprise area, they serve Chicago Style thin crust pizza reminiscent to the pizza of my youth growing up in the suburbs south of Chicago, I've had pizza from the \"THE BEST\" Chicago pizzeria's in my life and I can safely say this pizza is an accurate representation of that region.  The pizza is loaded with cheese and in typical chicago fashion some of the toppings are under the cheese and some are on top. prices are affordable and in many cases cheaper than the generic triad (pizza hut,dominos, papa johns) this is also a BYOB establishment so we like to show up with a bottle of wine or two. though I've seen families bring in entire coolers, I also recently heard they started offering delivery but the last time we went we dined in and have yet to try this service.

My \"best in class\" top pick for pizza in surprise."}
{"text":"Ordered a medium Deno's Special and 20 BBQ wings, both were fantastic. Decided to take them home (A/C must have been out) the place is very small only four tables, very sparsely decorated and sterile.  Incredible place for takeout! 

The food is great and with some table cloths, candlelight, and vino (no alcohol, so BYOB) this place could be that amazing hidden treasures you talk about for years."}
{"text":"I am ashamed at myself for not putting a review up for Deno's till now! Deno's is a hidden gem of Surprise. Nestled across the street from Del Web hospital and next door to a Hallmark store and a Safeway, one might not expect to come across some of the best pizza Surprise has to offer, but trust me- just try it. Deno's serves up thin flaky crust pizza cut into squares, the kind of pizza I fell in love with in Illinois and what I consider to be true Chicago style pizza. The toppings are under a blanket of cheese and there is never a dull bite. Deno's is reasonably price and BYOB. It is not unusual to see patrons in there with mini coolers enjoying a variety of beverages with their dinner. Please don't let the bare space and strip mall location deter you from trying it."}
{"text":"Been here many times!! An everytime it is awesome!! I Drive 30 mins just to get it! Best pizza i found in the Phoenix area. Always have good ingredients and never skimp on laying it out!!! Customer service is always great!! My wife loves the wings. And yes for you east coast people they have Hire's rootbeer!! Seeing the low ratings on here just makes me think someone pissed in someone's Cheerios!!! Awesome spot for Pizza and Wings! Will be returning over and over!!"}
{"text":"If you're going to head out for pizza this is the place to be! It may not look like much from the outside, but the smell of the pizza and wings will pull you in the second you open your door. The menu is pretty basic and mostly consists of pizza, wings, sandwiches , salads and appetizers. It's a bring your own beer establishment and it works. We decided on a medium sausage and pepperoni and 10 wings. The anticipation was crazy. I could smell the veggie pizza with peppers next to us and i knew ours would be awesome. Our food came out so quick with the largest container of ranch dressing I'd ever seen. It was great! None of those tiny containers to eat your wings or pizza if you like that sort of thing. I've never seen a more beautiful pizza and could not wait to dig in. Our hot wings were huge and just the right amount of sauce. I came in with an open mind. There is another pizza place in the same plaza and I was interested to see how it compared. Our experience and the food at Dino's stands on its own! My husband couldn't stop talking about how good the sausage was and it covered the pizza. The cheese was the best I've had. The crust was not soggy even with all the toppings etc . Perfect crunch for a thin crust. Our server was amazing and had a great smile. We will definitely be back with friends if we can find a seat because this place was filling up as the minutes went by. Definitely do yourself a favor and fill your belly! If you love pizza you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and I have to say Deno's has a very good thin crust pizza. Their sausage also has the seasonings I am accustomed to from back home. I order Deno's when I'm in the mood for a crispier (cracker like) crust. Lastly, how can you eat pizza without Hot Giardinera peppers? Their peppers are GREAT!"}
{"text":"I've gone to quite a few Chicago style pizzeria's since moving out here in search of the perfect pizza and the search is over this place had the best pizza of them all! The sausage was just like what l remember from pizzas back home in Chicago, the crust was thin and very tasty John made the pizza and did an excellent job plus we had a great conversation. The whole experience was awesome and it's worth the drive to Surprise, plus they have coke products...  having R.C. cola would've been real nostalgic though!"}
{"text":"Love this place, just hate they moved so far I can't go as often as I would like too. Wish they would open another establishment closer to where they used to be."}
{"text":"My first try at Denos.  Friday evening for a walk-in take out order.  Counter person said it would be ready in 15 minutes, but had to wait for 40 minutes.  I think they misplaced my order because other walk-ins placed orders after me and were served first.  Fortunately, when the order was ready, it was piping hot.  Pepperoni and sausage pizza with wings.  Wings were OK, tasty, but nothing special.  Deep fried, not baked.  The pizza however, was VERY good.  Crust was crisp, with just the right amount of sauce.  Pepperoni was flavorful.  The best part was the plentiful sausage, which was meaty, and not greasy like many places.  Overall, the pizza was great, but the service lacking.  Counter clerk was indifferent.  Might consider using them for phone-in orders only."}
{"text":"I have been too Chicago and this place is just like it...  must try ingredients shipped from Chicago...."}
{"text":"So glad we were referred to Deno's. I grew up in the Midwest with good pizza and this is definitely one of the bests in Arizona. Great atmosphere and fantastic food. Absolutely loved the staff and the nice girl who served us when we came in! We are definitely on the list of regulars for this place!"}
{"text":"Gave 1 star because i can't give 0 stars. On the company website they have a price and when you get there is a different price. Typical bait and switch, wouldnt honor price and had way too much attitude little punk, and the pizza wasn't even started yet after calling my order in. And them saying over the phone the price would be what the website says. Little thinkers running this place without customer service skills, this will be the first and last time coming here. Also the owner was too busy to discuss the matter. Going to drive around the corner to Little Sicily pizza, in the same parking lot and no bad attitudes and great deep dish pizza."}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza. They pile on the toppings. Great service as well. Well worth your time to try their pizza."}
