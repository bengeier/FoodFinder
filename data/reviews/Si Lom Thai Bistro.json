{"text":"Thai food is one of my favourites and as we live in the area, I was excited to try this new place. We ordered two mains, the Pad Thai Vegan and Panang Curry with Shrimp.   For drinks we had wine and beer so we didn't experience the cocktails!   Pros: The flavours of both were spot on, very authentic and delicious.  The Pad Thai wasn't too sweet.  Lots of shrimp in the curry.  Very friendly and quick service Medium spice was medium spice, not hotter or too mild.  Glasses, plates and cutlery were very clean - this puts me off if they are not.   Cons: I found the portions to be on the small size, this wouldn't have been an issue if we had an appetizer first but usually we don't need one when ordering similar dishes elsewhere.   It would have been nice to have more Tofu in the Pad Thai.   Come for the flavours and if you are very hungry, I would recommend ordering an appetizer too."}
{"text":"Great Thai food.  The green curry was excellent, great flavor.  Lunch menu pricing was a decent deal.  Would come back again.  I've been to many cities in Thailand and the food is on par.  Sat at the bar and the service was good even after the restaurant filled up.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing - one of the best Thai food in the city in my opinion.  It may even give Pai a run for its money.  We ordered the masaman beef and the garlic pepper beef.  Both dishes were delicious, flavourful  and tasted very authentic, with a bit of a \"street style\" modern flair.  We will definitely be back here again and again.  Our favourite new restaurant in the Village!"}
{"text":"I am very impressed by their food in general, but to top it all off I have received only top notch service every time I ate here... I'd choose this place over other Thai joints in the city where the wait time is 1+ hour."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of Si Lom Thai when there are so many comparable and in my opinion better quality Thai places in the downtown area. Came here to try some of the interesting alcoholic drinks they offer as well as getting a fill of some awesome Thai food but ended up a bit disappointed. The green curry I had was overpoweringly spicy and they left huge chunks of super spicy peppers in the curry that would kill you if you even touched them with your tongue. This is coming from someone who loves spicy food. The amount of \"chicken\" in the curry was minimal and the sangria that we ordered tasted more like blended juice than wine. The interior is nicely decorated but the plastic covered tables feel sticky and cheap. It can get super hot in the small dining room so you're probably better off dining outdoors if it's not scorching. The portions weren't particularly large considering that they were kind of pricey and it would be better to get a few things to share to try more items.   Pros: - No wait - Waiter brought water right away  Cons: - Alcoholic drinks are barely alcoholic  Overall I would say there are better places to get your fill of Thai that are more comfortable and offer better portions."}
{"text":"Small lunch portions that are appropriate for lunch. There are 3 vegan options and then your typical Thai fare. I had the veggie tofu option which was very decent. Service was fast but not particularly personal. They have alcoholic slushy drinks which I plan on trying when I have dinner there."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food! Great friendly service and truly authentic Thai food. Loved every bitr"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful and authentic small place located in pride village! The waiters converse among themselves in Thai, and are very welcoming and friendly. The food is also amazing!  My friends ordered the soft shell crab and vegan pad thai, along with a drink called the lemonade blue pea tea. The drink came first, and we were so amused by it! Essentially, the blue colour of the drink turns a lovely lavender hue once you add the tonic/soda. The chemical reaction is absolutely fascinating.  The pad thai were also very yummy and not too oily or greasy at all. Surprisingly, the vegan one tasted almost exactly the same as the soft shell crab one, with the exception that it didn't come with mangoes. Both had generous portions of peanuts, bean sprouts, noodles, and chives. The soft shell crab was finger licking good!!! It was fried perfectly and extremely flavourful.  I got the papaya salad with a side of sticky rice, and enjoyed it... At the beginning. I ordered medium spicy (apparently medium spice has one whole chili pepper!), and it became too spicy for me to handle. Eventually, my tongue began to burn and swell, and then it gradually moved up to my lips. My eyes started to tear up, and then my nose began to run... How unsightly.  The flavour of the salad was great, being both tangy and spicy. My main complaint (apart from it being too spicy, but that is my fault completely for not ordering mild spicy) was that there were very few peanuts, despite the advertising/menu description. The sticky rice was far too hard, and became an unpliable piece of food by the end of my meal.  Customer service, however, is A+. Will definitely come again to try more items (please don't judge me on the salad, I wasn't feeling much of an appetite)."}
{"text":"Yummy food and friendly service. Price is a bit more expensive than others. I like the vegan selections there are three to choose from."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant! I had crispy pork with rice and I finished all of them! the papaya salad and green curry were also really good! good environment and prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"Yes it's Thai but it gives off a Chinese military vibe. Something about cracking those wooden chopsticks and going to town on your food. The plates are metal as well. I love it.   Food was good but not something you could eat everyday. It's sodium overload. It's as if the chef got a super soaker of sauce.   Amex: No  Clothes smell bad after? 100%"}
{"text":"I'm a major Thai food lover, so I've tried lots of Thai restaurants in pretty much every city I've lived in or visited. Even by Toronto standards, Si Lom Thai Bistro was much more expensive than better Thai places I've tried (Khao San, Pai, etc), considering the portion size is also smaller. The Pad Thai tasted authentic and flavorful, but I would not come back here because it isn't worth the price you pay (I think I paid around $18 after tax for the pad thai).   Also a note for all you vegetarians out there - this place told me that they can't substitute tofu for meat in any of the curries or dishes. This basically leaves you with only 3-4 options from their \"vegan menu,\" none of which include Thai curries. Every single other Thai place I've been to has been very open to substituting tofu for meat"}
{"text":"Had the Green chicken curry and the chicken and shrimp pad thai and asked them to make it as spicy as they could. They did not disappoint! Soooo good! Chicken is all white meat and cooked perfectly and the flavours and veggies complemented each other. One of my new favourite thai restaurants in the village! Will come again!"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly really delicious. It's a little place, maybe 30 or less seats. The menu isn't massive but has the basic pad Thai, curries and tom yum soup. But there's some other dishes that aren't typical in Thai restaurants outside of Thailand. Like pork jowl and spicy pork bone soup. It is better described as Thai Street Food. Their spicy dishes are amazing, I can handle it but my friends cannot. One friend ordered the Spicy Pork Bone Soup, it turned out to be too spicy but she downed it anyways because it was still super flavorful. I ordered the pork jowl and added some of the chilies from the pork bone soup since I love spicy.  Other dishes friends ordered were very delicious as well. Although this isn't a typical Thai restaurant, they don't even have meat satay ::shocked face::  They keep it simple and the dishes are extremely well done."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic thai food. They really captured the street food essence of thailand as well. I had the best penang curry with rice and the service was really good and hospitable. They also have 3-4 options for the level of spice you want. I ordered spicy and it was just right for me. If you're not too big on spicy, you can ask them to make it mild."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. Portions sizes were great, the atmosphere was lovey, and the food was ++fresh and delicious. Cocktails and beers are a little expensive. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Some of the nicest service I've had In a while. Like really really good service. Apps were pretty boring, standard. This isn't pai. You aren't going to be instagramming pics of this food and taking tourists here. But it's a delicious neighbourhood option. I loved the pad Thai - it was straightforward and I'm okay with that. But really, the service elevated this from a 3 to a 4. Also - you can get Starbucks wifi on their patio, from the Sbux across the street !"}
{"text":"Some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I hate writing negative reviews, and normally avoid them, but I felt I had to leave a review after the terrible treatment we received at Si Lom Thai Bistro. I've worked in hospitality, and the general rule is that the customer is always right - you want your customers to leave happy and satisfied. When we told the staff that we were unhappy with a dish, they essentially told us we were wrong, there was nothing wrong with the food because they had already served that dish 100 times that day. First the waitress, then the manager, stood in the middle of their restaurant arguing with us, causing a scene and refusing to listen to anything we said. They refused to do anything about our complaint. We asked if they wanted us to leave their restaurant unhappy and hungry, and they basically shrugged their shoulders and would not offer a solution. In my days as a waitress I took countless meals back to the chef saying the customer was not satisfied, and whether the chef agreed with the customer or not, he always prepared a new meal, or if the complaint was after the meal had been eaten, we wouldn't charge them for it. I have never experienced outright denial and refusal by wait staff before. Whether or not the rest of our meals were good was irrelevant by this point. We left the restaurant in shock, disappointed and totally dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Great authentic flavors, quality of food, and large portions.  I had the Pad Kra Prao, which on the menu is called Khao Kraprow Khai Dow, with minced pork. They were reticent to make the meal spicy for me, but I said that I liked spicy food.  We agreed upon a med-hot spice level.  The spice was good, they were a little heavy handed on the sweet soy sauce or might have added palm sugar, but it was still very good.  I asked for a side of the traditional condiment that is made of chili peppers soaking in fish sauce, which I promptly sprinkled over my dish.  This might have won me some street-cred in this Thai-frequented establishment, because there were a few looks of disbelief from the staff when I did so.    Many of the clientele were Thai and speaking Thai, which lent an air of authenticity, which was backed up by the quality of food that came out of the kitchen.  The server was very kind and helpful when explaining the differences between the ingredients and flavors of the dishes.  The price for my meal was a great value and if I lived in Toronto, I could see myself eating here at least once a week, if not more.  Unfortunately but fortunately, I live in the San Francisco bay area which means that there are plenty of restaurants to frequent when I am craving Thai food.  If you live in Toronto, you have to hit up this spot, it is a must try!"}
{"text":"Went to Si Lom Thai Bistro with my sister for dinner last night.  Yelp had just sent me an email about new openings in my area and mentioned the restaurant.  We shared one of the frozen alcoholic bucket drinks - it had all sorts of candy topping, fun stir stick, test tubes to mix in the booze.  It was a fun drink and worth snapping an Instagram photo (it didn't taste very alcoholic, so not sure of the exact amount mixed in).  My sister had a chicken dish which she said was delicious and devoured.  I had the Soft Shell Crab Pad Thai and thought it was really tasty.  I was surprised when they brought it to our table that there were actually 2 FULL soft shell crabs plated on top, I was just thinking some crab would be mixed in so that exceeded my expectations!  We didn't order any apps, the mains are large enough in size.  They had some desserts that looked tasty but we were too full to order one.  Would definitely go back to try something else.  The decor is neat and eclectic.  A nice restaurant addition to the Church Wellesley Village."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that Si Lom opened in my neighborhood... I have waited for three visits before writing this review in order to ensure consistency, and I can say that for me - it's my new favorite spot on Church Street between College and Wellesley...  The food is fresh, and is authentically Thai... I have had the Pad Thai chicken with shrimp on three occasions, and I'm hooked. It's made in the traditional Thai style way, with fish sauce, bean sprouts, peanuts, an egg and a delicious Chive shoot - just like Bangkok. I always ask for extra fish sauce... but not to worry this dish is not sweet.   I've also had the fried rice with egg - delicious; and tonight I tried the \"fried chives\" - omg delicious.  Everything goes better with a drink - my go-tos are either a Mill Street Organic or one of their signature drinks called a \"Si Lom 4\" - either of which will be sure to wet your whistle...  Without a doubt, and without prejudice or favoritism - my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"This is up there with all the other top Thai restaurants in the city like Sukhothai, Khao San Road, and Pai. The pad Thai and pad see ew are excellent."}
{"text":"9.5/10 Chicken pad Thai: Favorite place for Pad Thai in Toronto. Authentic flavors unlike most other places. Chicken was a bit overcooked but its a must try.   8/10 Green curry: was also tasty but too watery for my liking. Missing green eggplants."}
{"text":"Update: So apparently now this restaurant is in the business of gaslighting it's customers if they're unhappy - it's obviously very convenient to cite CCTV footage when all that footage provides you with is two people having a conversation, not the contents of the conversation. We now have a \"he said she said\" situation.   More than anything, I'm outraged that the manager claimed that I was trying to get a free meal and refused to pay. I will gladly show anyone my bank statement with this restaurant's name and the amount that I paid if they ask. Do not call me a thief. I was never offered a replacement meal, and I only asked to take the meal home after I had given up arguing with the manager about being unhappy with my food because I still had to pay for it. The dish was untouched because again, I didn't enjoy it.   Lastly, don't think you are fooling someone by saying you are merely some new establishment. I do not appreciate false allegations charged against me. I vividly remember the chain of events as I hadn't experienced anything like it at a restaurant. And yes, my friend did enjoy her green curry! Kudos to you for making a customer happy. That's your job. I will remind you that if she was so inclined to send it back due to moral outrage, you would probably have started arguing with her too."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor bring me straight to Thailand. I love how even down to the small details such as dishes and utensils are what you would use to eat in Thailand.   We ordered the , Labb calamari, chicken pad Thai, red curry and the Si Lom Soi 4 bucket drink and Thai iced tea. Everything was great and the drink was very fun and tasted good as well. With the calamari dish you should eat it together with the red onions because the flavours just pop in your mouth.  I would definitely come back and try the green curry.   Also, I went on a Tuesday evening at 6:30 and it wasn't busy but an hour later it was a full house!"}
{"text":"I always get the veggie pad thai here and I love it. It is fresh, flavourful and actually contains vegetables! It is similarly priced and comparable in taste to the one at Pai, which has been my historical favourite.   The great thing about Si Lom is that I never have to wait for a table (it's not because the restaurant is bad, but that it's still somewhat new and looks unassuming from the outside!), which is a refreshing change of pace unlike at other Thai restaurants in the city.   Best part yet is that the delicious food comes quickly and with friendly service! I recommend also ordering a Thai iced tea because it is very satisfying to have with your meal! I would give five enthusiastic stars if they expanded their vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Amazing place! We were wondering why it was so packed for dinner, when all the neighbors were almost empty. No wonder! Yummy food, great service, cute decor, great attention to details. Overall: A+ to this thai place in the gay village!"}
{"text":"Their pad thai taste very much like hk fried noodles. No where near as good as Pai. I haven't tried the other things yet but hopefully they taste more authentic than their pad Thai."}
{"text":"This was recommended to me as being a very authentic place. Definitely lived up to my expectation. Amazing selection... original, tasty, and friendly! Me and my friend will be returning soon."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a very authentic decorations and ambience atmosphere.  It's great for lunch time - no need for line up."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, lovely ambience! Definitely recommend the Thai Iced Tea."}
{"text":"My go to at Thai places is Green Curry Chicken and this place does not disappoint. The Green Curry Chicken is a wee bit spicy though, so be pre warned.  The spring rolls are okay but there is a slight taste of frozen with them - I feel like they are from the freezer and then cooked.  Soft shell crab is tasty, and can be a wee bit salty but I suppose that's how crab should taste.  Inside the restaurant is very clean and looks newly renovated. I think I read somewhere that it recently had a fire.  My go to places are Sabai Sabai, Khan San Road and Pai. This is also a place I would consider. Tasty!"}
{"text":"Saw the restaurant on yelp and decided to try it for lunch. Was pretty empty for a Sunday afternoon with the exception of one other table and we were promptly seated by the host/server/bartender. We decided to go for the pork lettuce wrap, soft shell crab noodles and of course the novelty cocktail in a bucket.  If you like just taking pictures of cocktails this would suit you just fine. Think sprinkles, fun stirrers and multicoloured test tubes and straws. Me and my friend however are more booze forward, so  we asked to add an additional 2oz of alcohol to our lemongrass cocktail (the name slips my mind). Just don't. Not the additional shots part, but just don't even bother - it's tasteless. I think we drank more simple syrup and melted sprinkles than lemongrass flavouring. We initially thought it was because of the extra alcohol but after having asked the bartender to add more 'lemongrass' we realized it was a lost cause and gave up on the drink all together. The meat in the lettuce wrap/minced pork salad was dry and overlooked and the only redeeming part of the meal was the soft shell grab. Generous I must say in the meat but nothing spectacular that would have you going back."}
{"text":"Checked out this place while searching for a Thai restaurant. We placed an order on Foodora for a Pad Thai with chicken and a Red Curry with Grilled Beef. Our order was ready on time and well packaged. The food was still hot when we got home and opened it. I thought both dishes were quite good - I liked the pumpkin in the red curry. I'm taking a star off because of the amount of rice that we got. It was barely one cup - which I didn't understand. There was a lot of curry but barely enough rice for one person. Most of the curry sat uneaten. If we order again, we'll have to make sure to ask for an extra order of rice."}
{"text":"I've had two dishes here.. the holy basil beef on rice and the chicken pad Thai.  I'm my opinion these versions are the best I've had in Toronto. Thai spicy is THAI SPICY.."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! Would recommend if you and your date are feeling adventurous for some Thai food. It's not too spicy, but the curries are still fairly flavourful!"}
{"text":"I came here with my friend spontaneously on Halloween! It was fun to see the servers with painted skull faces. The space of the restaurant is a bit small (me and the guy behind me were practically back to back). The cozy decor really set the atmosphere and I also loved the LIT music playing in the background. The servers are really efficient and friendly as well!  I needed something to wake me up so I ordered the Lemongrass Juice Tea ($4.50). It was refreshing and did its job in keeping me awake. It had a cute hand decoration which I appreciated but its a shame that I didn't have a photo.   Soft Shell Crab Pad Thai ($22) had a smaller portion than I expected which is fine if the quality makes up for it. The taste was great, pack of flavours and interesting ingredients like shredded mango! It was also my first time having a full soft crab so I can't comment on the quality of the crab but I don't feel like it should of been a part of the pad thai. It had its own separate flavours and textures that would of been better on its own. There was no distinct taste of crab in the pad thai itself. I think in the future, getting a regular pad thai would of been more worth it!   We finished off with the Black Bean Coconut Sticky Rice ($7) as a dessert. The sticky rice worked well with the coconut milk! It was delicious except it was a bit too sweet for me.   I enjoyed my first time at Si Lom Thai!  I will be sure to come back again with smarter food choices!"}
{"text":"This place is SO good!!! Si Lom was an extremely pleasant surprise. Since I'm from Thailand, I have extremely high standards when it comes to Thai food, and not many places seem to fit the bill.   I came here for my brother's birthday lunch and we ordered a ton of food to share. We started off with the Som Tam with Salted Eggs, the Ocean Wings and the Nam Tok with Pork Jowl. Flavours are completely on-point here! I would order all three dishes again. We also ordered the Leng Tom Zab, which is a Thai Spicy Pork Bone Soup. Trust me when I say this is as tasty and spicy as the ones we used to eat in Thailand. They don't dumb down the spice levels here at all, which I truly appreciated. For our mains, we shared the Pad Thai with Soft Shell Crab and the Khao Soi with beef. The Pad Thai with Soft Shell Crab wasn't my favourite; I felt it was a bit sweet for my tastes, but I appreciated the huge soft shell crab that comes in this dish. The Khao Soi was super yummy, but I prefer the noodles that they serve with the Khao Soi over at Sukhothai. I also prefer Sukhothai's curry sauce, but that's just a matter of personal preference.   Having said that, I would totally come here again. Si Lom offers a lot of truly authentic Thai dishes that aren't offered at most of the other Thai restaurants, and they do them well!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday last night, was really great! Soft shell crab pad thai was very flavourful and a massive meal for the price ($23), definitely good for leftovers. My friends had the chicken pad thai and khao soi and loved them both, prices were also very reasonable. Service is attentive and friendly, we even got some free little coconut cream tapioca desserts at the end of our meal which was a nice touch. My only suggestion is regarding the spice levels. I ordered my pad thai \"spicy\", and i didn't find it very spicy at all... so if you're wanting *real* spice, I would suggest going for the \"Thai spicy\" option or the \"extremely spicy\" option for an extra dollar. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times already and have to say the food and service, never disappoints. Foodies need to try this place. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"The best pineapple chicken fried rice I've had in years, great service and friendly staff, I will absolutely recommend"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The decor is super cute and the servers were really nice.  We ordered Si Lom Road Cocktail that comes in a bucket to share between two people and for food we ordered the Pad Thai Soft Shell Crab and Nam Tok with Pork Jowl and everything was so DELICIOUS!!! I highly recommend both the food dishes we ordered - especially the soft shell crab pad thai! Omg amazing!!! :D I love how you can just eat the whole crab without going through all the mess of having to break it open haha.   I am definitely coming back to try their other dishes!! If you love thai food you must try this place!!!"}
{"text":"Pros: I do love the taste of the food. It's pretty authentic and I grew up in Asia.  The decor is super cozy and light. Their milk tea is awesome!   Cons: I can't see myself being a regular unless I'm in the area. The prices don't feel justified for it. The portions don't feel as filling for the price.   Is it better than most Thai places? Arguably so. But most places usually give an abundance of food even for a long wait. So you can scarf down a lot of food happily. But since this is on Church street and I could see it getting popular and busy, the food might not be enough to sate your hunger while waiting(unless you're willing to dish out some cash).   If you can get in on a chill day(quick food/drink and out) . It is worth it. Their cocktails do look amazing and I wouldn't mind coming here for drinks with a couple of friends."}
{"text":"Some of their foods include too much strong herbs. Not all foods are bad. But I literally vomited after I tasted my friends' dishes(they also couldn't eat). We usually like Thai food, but their herbs were too strong.. Ok.. but I'd say their service and interior were nice.. that's all"}
{"text":"Want to try a new Thai restaurant which is at par with some of the best Thai resto in Toronto (i.e. Sukho Thai, Pai, Khao San Road, Mengrai Thai) then you must try Si Lom Thai Bistro!  I was really blown away by this place, didn't expect that the food will be so good especially their Pad Thai Chicken.  We also ordered their Green Curry Chicken and it's a perfect combination of sour, salty, sweet and spicy.   They serve authentic Thai food judging by how fresh the ingredients are and how the spices are made from scratch.  The servings are not bad either, just right for the price you pay.  Ambiance/place is small but cozy and servers are very friendly and nice.  I would have given 5 stars but didn't really enjoyed the appetizer we ordered - Grilled Squid as it's tough and rubbery."}
{"text":"I looked at the reviews and was a bit too hyped for this place as it was supposed to be on the level of Pai / Sabai Sabai, etc. I think this place was a good alternative, but wasn't as good as the others. This place is a lot less busier though and the noise is not as high. Making it a pretty great date place as it's not too far from Yonge and the food is still pretty decent/good.    Service: 4/5 Food: 3.5/5 Price: 3.5/5  Overall: 3.75/5"}
{"text":"Really great new addition to the village! To start I had the boozy slushy with gummy bears which was delicious! I saw it listed somewhere as great for sharing but I drank the whole thing myself. I then had the squid app which was good but needed a tiny bit more seasoning. My main was the beef Kho soi which was beautifully plated and wonderfully spicy. My fiance had the soft shell crab pad Thai which was literally off the hook. The crab was soft, fresh and delicious and the noodles perfectly cooked and flavored. I most definitely will be back. It's a bit expensive but worth the price."}
{"text":"What a find... Amazing service. Amazing Thai food. One of the BEST meals this year.. Green city w chicken. Can't wait to try other items... Friendly, nice decor. Great addition to the village."}
{"text":"Their portions are pretty generous but definitely on the more pricey side. If you want to experience some Thai street food this would be a good place to start.  I really enjoyed the soft shell crab pad Thai, it's great to share! Their som tum (papaya salad) was pretty Spicy too so if you're not too afraid of a good spice then definitely worth the try.  Great ambiance for some bites and a drink!"}
{"text":"I got the Khao Krapow and it was fantastic! The waiter (owner?) was super nice and the service was very fast. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for authentic Thai food downtown."}
{"text":"First time coming here. I got the Khao Saoi Beef which was $16.  It had a mix of crispy noodles and noodles cooked in curry with chunks of stew beef and mixed veggies.  Thought it on the small size when I got it.  Beef was a bit more dry and chewy than I would have liked.  Flavours for this dish was more bland than other places that offer this dish.  Prices are high for what you are getting.  Would give this a 2.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Mmm we first saw the slushie drinks on Instagram and added this to our \"must go\" list. I had the Pad Thai and it was excellent. I gobbled it down in no time. The tofu was the best texture I've ever had. The slush drink was actually not that good haha- but it looked good ;) service was good too."}
{"text":"I always do the can you speak Thai? And if the staff can speak back, they are ahead of the game. We started with the grilled calamari and nam Jim... always yummy. And then had the Koi Soi and glass noodles for my friend. Happy we tried the food here, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious. New favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto! Thai spicy is THAI spicy--be forewarned. Lovely crowd, friendly servers, and lively atmosphere make the wait for a table bearable.   Here's what we ordered:  Spring rolls - average joe deep fried goodness (3.5/5)  Pad Thai soft shell crab - definite game changer; the crab adds an extra dimension of flavour that makes every other Pad Thai taste like instant noodles GET THIS (5/5)  Pad Kee Mao Chicken - You need to be a fan of bamboo shoots to like this because it's super prominent in this dish--if you have no idea what bamboo shoots taste like... maybe stay away haha (4/5)  Khao Soi Beef - A beef creamy curry noodle soup with crispy wonton chips! It's also as tasty as it sounds (4/5)  Pork Krapow - their basil stir fried pork is crispy and aromatic and spicy and delicious. This is tied with the pad Thai for my fave dish of the night (5/5)  We waited maybe 40/50 minutes for our food. I know that seems ridiculous but it really amped our appetite and the sangrias kept us happy! So I can vouch that you'll have a fantastic night, just don't expect a quick dinner ;)"}
{"text":"so gooood..  while it has some of the thing you do.e to expect at a thai restaurant. there are things in the menu with trying that I never seen before. I tried the pork bone soup and rad na, padseeew (this one I always get no matter where I go). all was really good. pork bone soup really sour but it was so enjoyable. . nice interiors  too."}
{"text":"Super friendly service. Drinks are bit pricey but lots of choices. The food takes me back to bangkock. Close your eyes while eating and the flavor is sooooooooo goooood it reminds me of a short trip to thialand while ago. Not sure where they even get such authentic ingredients and veggies. Don't get \"spicy\" as it was super spicy. Super nice friendly busy place. 10/10!!!!!  The bucket of beer with gummy bear and tequila comes highly recommended."}
{"text":"The service was amazing and I really wanted to try all their buckets of cocktails if I had the time. We had the Pao Kee Mao Chicken (2 Chilis) and Massaman Braised Beef Curry (1 chili). The chicken was really spicy but tasted really good so it was really hard to stop. My curry was slightly sweet so it didn't feel like there was much heat and I kinda wished there was. Overall it was pretty good but Ive definitely had better. I would go again."}
{"text":"This is as authentic as it gets in Toronto in terms of Thai food.  (The peppers aren't there merely for decorative reasons either, by the way.)  Sure, if you think Khao San Road is \"authentic\", then you'd probably argue with me on this one.  Otherwise, this place isn't just in a different league, we're talking about different sports.  (I do realize, at the same time, that some people consider Taco Bell to be Mexican food. That is, however, not my opinion.)  The negative reviews seem to be from those who just pretend to be cultured, but can't take spicy food, yet insist on needing to take instagrams selfies of their \"curry of the day\".  Don't mind them.  You'll find their basic selves in an air conditioned establishment with faux reclaimed wood furniture and stick-on grafifti tiles closer to King West.  If this place were in the core of downtown, it would crush all of the watered down Thai restaurants in the King-Adelaide corridor.  However, I'm actually glad that they haven't moved to the core as I would suspect it'd be too easy to succumb to the demands of the core's basic masses.  Prices are very reasonable here and if you want fish, it's not breaded, fried garbage with the remnants of a hydrated-from-powder curry that is mass produced once a week - you get with-the-bone, and with-the-head fish the way that people all over the world actually eat fish.  They keep the windows open, so that's why it's a bit hotter during the summer.  It also saves on air conditioning so that they can keep overhead costs lower, and not have to jack up the prices of your dish."}
{"text":"Good service. Good portion, Fresh food, a bit noisy"}
{"text":"It's definitely more authentic Thai, but the pricing is way too high for food amounts. Some of the dishes were a bit odd, and quite unpalatable, e.g., one dish was ground meat with a giant hunk of uncut cabbage. The pad Thai was ok, the steamed noodles were not, not cHive cakes were super oily and too chewy, just raw rice paper with very little in them. The traditional chicken dish with oily rice was very old dry chicken that was just not edible"}
{"text":"I have been going to the same Thai restaurants in Toronto (eg Pai, Sabai Sabai, Thai Basil) and decided to try something new.. and boy was I pleasantly surprised!   I ordered the Panang chicken and my friend ordered the beef Khao Soi. The flavours of both dishes were phenomenal. The menu says the Panang curry is spicy but I felt it was pretty mild (considering that I do not take heat well). We ordered the ice cream dessert dish that they had and we did not feel that it was worth the price. We also tried the dark roast Thai ice tea which tasted like grass jelly... if you're looking for the flavours of a traditional Thai ice tea I would not suggest it.   Only half their tables were filled on a Wednesday night --I prefer this because it allowed for conversation to take place at a comfortable noise level. Overall the waiter was attentive and the food was really good! I will not think twice about coming back!"}
{"text":"Typical Thai fare but small portions and over priced. We ordered bucket drinks (12.95) and they tasted like juice. The mussels appetizer were basically plain cold mussels placed on top of raw lemongrass-do not order! The description was deceptive. We ordered calamari, pla pa sa (fish), pad thai, curry, som tum, and pork bone soup and were disappointed. I felt like there was no effort in balancing flavours that Thai food is known for, as these items were either too sweet or too sour. The only upsides: nam tok, (although was 5 thin slices of pork) was tasty, and service was friendly."}
{"text":"Grilled squid is very tender and it goes well with the tangy garlic dipping sauce. The green curry with chicken is flavourful, the spicy level is 2 chillies seems just right. The Pai Thai with chicken I had is a bit on the sweeter side. This Thai restaurant is authentic and I am looking very much froward to trying different dishes!"}
{"text":"Found this when Googled area and I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty the food was.  I love good Thai food, but I'm picky about this cuisine (like everything, there's good, bad and mediocre).  Service was friendly, but could be a bit more attentive.  My friend arrived first and grabbed a patio table (nice seating!), but we had to ask for another cup for me, which took a little while and it didn't match my friend's pretty cup (not biggie but still)."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Thai places in the city. I've tried most items on the menu. Since I live not too far from there, I've been a regular to the restaurant. The servers are super friendly and remember their customers. The price is very decent, and it's very authentic. Wayyyy better than the previous Thai place at this exact location. I'd definitely go back. The only thing that bothers me a little bit is that the air circulation isn't the greatest."}
{"text":"The strip of church street between bloor and dundas is filled with yummy food option that always exceeds expectation. Si lom Thai bistro is another fine example!  The chicken pad Thai is very flavourful, lots of peanuts, bean sprouts, tofu, packed with yummy noodles! My friend got the minced pork over steamed noodles and vegetables. Thai food is just as appetizing to look as to eat!  There's ample amount of seating in the restaurant on a weekday night. We also noticed couple tables of customers are Thai and spoke to the wait staff in Thai! We must be in good hands if Thai people are agreeing to the authenticity of this Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had the pad thai and it was very good. I have been to many thai restaurants in Toronto, but these guys definitely did it right. Very good meal, great service and good pricepoint. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Very comparable to the more well known popular thai places downtown (Pai, Sukho Thai, Khao San Road, etc), but with a bit more originality.  There is a small patio which was full for dinner on a Sunday evening so we sat inside. We ordered the soft shell crab pad thai and the chicken panang curry with the tea bucket #2.  The pad thai was excellent, panag was just as good. I thought it was weird they didn't ask for spice level. The pad thai was not spicy at all and the curry was very mild. The drink bucket was worth getting but don't expect it to get you even buzzed.  There is also a yelp check-in promotion here for a free daily special drink which when I went was some type of special chrysanthemum tasting sweet iced tea.  The prices are on the more expensive side if you want it to be filling in terms of quantity.  Would definitely come back as it's a nice change from the few thai places downtown."}
{"text":"It's legit Thai. Good portions, lots 'o red chilies to turn up the heat, and reasonable prices for 6 or 7 choices on the lunch special menu, which featured the usual suspects -- a couple of curries and a couple of noodles.   Very quick service at around 1pm, unlike that other Thai place in the 'hood that makes you wait forever for your takeout -- I ordered, sat down to check my emails, and I didn't even get through reading the first one (Ok, it was a long work email) and my food was already brought out for me. Seriously fast.   I got the chicken pad kraprow (called \"gra prow\" at some other places) which was very good. Came with two small veggie spring rolls which was a nice surprise. Kind of didn't like paying an extra $1.50 for the fried egg (it's an essential part of the dish, isn't it?) but total price of $13 tax in is A-OK so no real complaints here. I guess egg-haters get to save a bit of $$.   I didn't stay but the place looks small, I could see it filling up fast at lunch time. Otherwise everything was great.  Will be back to try the full slate of lunch specials."}
{"text":"My friend jus came back into town and the first thing we decided to do...was obviously go eat. She had suggested to come here for Thai food and I could never say no to Thai!!!! When we first walked in, it was a tad stuffy but the service was hands down amazing. Our server's name was Nicky and he's from Thailand. He was very attentive to when we needed something and ensured that we enjoyed our meal. We used our free beverage from checking in here from yelp and got the drink of the day. My friend n I shared the soft shell crab pad Thai and the mango salad.  I got to say, the food game is on point and definitely just as good as any Thai restaurant in Toronto like Pai, Salad King and Sukhothai.  If you haven't tried this place, you should because u won't regret it!  I would definitely come back here to try their alcoholic beverages, the food and hands down the amazing servers!!!!!"}
{"text":"So excited to have an authentic Thai restaurant in the neighborhood. Pad thai was amazing. One thing that threw me off was the laarb. It was listed under salad but it turned out to be a pile of ground meat salad instead. Almost no veggies. No complaint here, I like meat. Service was pretty fast despite only 2 people working on the floor that's night. Will definitely visit again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I lived in Thailand on two different occasion?s in my life and for me,? the food at Si Lom incites nostalgia unlike any other Thai restaurant? in Toronto. The Khao Kraprow Khai Dow with prik nam pla really hits the spot. I would also recommend the som tum and pad thai."}
{"text":"I do love Thai, and this is one of a few Thai restaurants bringing real flavors! I wish I could go back..."}
{"text":"Si Lom is a Thai restaurant in the Village named after the popular district and road in Bangkok. It has an array of your typical Thai dishes, such as pad thai and curry. However, Si Lom is known for their fun cocktail buckets. These drinks are meant for sharing but can easily be consumed by one person as well. I first ordered the Si Lom Road to share, which was a pretty light and delicious drink. My friend  then decided to order the Jolly Bear & Friends Kamikaze. It honestly tasted quite similar to Si Lom Road, minus the gummy bears. I don't suggest ordering both at the same time because it's like buying the same drink twice.  For my meal, I ordered the Pad Thai Chicken dish and loved it! It's definitely on par with Pai's Pad Thai (a restaurant I always recommend to everyone). The restaurant is overall very nice and is perfect for lunch or dinner with friends and family. I think it might be one of my new favourite Thai restaurants!"}
{"text":"Friday, I ordered take out from Foodora. I was craving for Khao Soi and this was one of the places that had it. I never ate here before or ordered from this place before.   I ordered their Khao Soi which was about 15 bucks and I swear it was something different from all other other Khao Soi that I have tried at Pai or Sukho Thai. The noodles were much thinner, the braised beef was so juicy and so tender.   I was glad that they actually added the extra spices in my soup broth, however it was still not spicy. This soup had an amazing flavor, it was so rich and creamy. My favorite part was the braised beef and the thin noodles. I was always a bigger fan of the wider egg noodles but these thin egg noodles were delicious.   I can't wait to try their other dishes.   Happy Eating Fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant with a good amount of seating and great service. Not to mention really tasty fresh food. I tried the soft shell crab pad thai ($23) and it was so satisfying I will have to come back again. The portion was huge, the crab was crunchy, and the pad thai itself was very flavourful but not overly sweet like some pad thais. Overall a great experience and will be back for the soft shell crab again ."}
{"text":"Food tastes mediocre. Definitely had better Thai food elsewhere. The drinks on the other hand look pretty cool, even though i haven't tried. Service was very slow but i don't blame them as it gets busy with only two staffs working."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food that also offers different options compared to the well known Thai places. Flavours were intense, lots of spice (love it!), fast service and friendly staff. Will be back."}
{"text":"One of the most satisfying meal in Toronto for us in quite some time. A fantastic experience that involved super delicious food, creative cocktails and Thai iced tea, amazing service, and decent value in terms of price and service size. We were most impressed with the surprising taste of most dishes we ordered, and in a good way. The soft shell pad Thai is definitely deserving the name of their signature dish, the crab is flavourful, and the noodles has fresh bean sprouts and mango for you to mix in, which provides a more unique texture combination and taste. We always enjoy pad thai at Pai, Kao San, and Sukhothai, and we loved Si Lom's take on this noodle dish the most. Pla Pae Sa is a special fish dish with fried white bass fish in nugget style, and vegetable topping, then a soupy orange curry sauce is poured on top when served. It's another awesome adventure of texture and flavour. The pineapple fried rice left us wanting more, the papaya salad has on-the-point seasoning. The tom yum soup is slightly thicker than most you'd have in Toronto, and another good surprise of the right balance of flavour that has some sourness, spiciness, and mild sweetness from the shrimp and mushroom. The green curry was also great and was actually the the least surprising of all. The friendly staffs took care of us with fast service and proper instructions to eat the dishes and enjoy the cocktails too. We will definitely go back and order everything we had again, and will try other dishes on the menu. And we will likely pick Si Lom over Pai, Sukhothai, Kao San in the future if we have a choice. And that's saying a lot!"}
{"text":"-customer service was great -food was great tasting and authentic. I like that I got to eat durian and bring back memories of going to South East Asian  -establishment had a nice interior.   All in all I can't wait to bring friends here again."}
{"text":"Great Thai restaurant with good food that has a different flavour profile than the group of Sukho Thai / Khao San Road / etc restaurants. I'll definitely be back!  Food & drink - I had the vegan pad thai (kudos to the separate vegan section of the menu!) which I liked. It had much more veggies than most places which was refreshing. Good flavour overall as well! I had the lemongrass iced tea to drink which was like a sprite with a light lemongrass flavour. Most people were drinking buckets, likely to reminisce about a trip to the islands.   Atmosphere - unpretentious with a street style / bustling urban centre flair. Fun colours, metal chairs, gold intricate patterns on the wall - there's a lot going on just like in SE Asia!"}
{"text":"Given the recent drop in quality of what I've received from Sabai Sabai lately, I've started going here its great. The service was very good and friendly, the portions sizes are reasonable (not massive, but bigger than Sabai Sabai), and the food tastes great.  The chicken pad thai and the vegan pad thai are both good (although IMO Pai is better, there's nothing as good as this near Yonge and Bloor), and I really like the red curry shrimp. The curries can be VERY spicy, though. I love spicy food and the foreigner spicy level tasted like fire - its definitely much, much hotter than the same spice levels at KSR and Pai."}
{"text":"//THE FOOD// CHICKEN PAD THAI (4.5/5) - perfect combo of sweet sour & savoury. Loved the peanut bits too. GREEN CURRY WITH CHICKEN (4/5) - was quite spicy and tasted rich, would've liked portions to be bigger.  KHAO SOI BEEF (5/5) - my absolute favourite thing we ordered. The stewed beef was very tender & flavourful. I loved the combination of the rich red curry that soaked the egg noodles.  PINEAPPLE FRIED RICE WITH CHICKEN (3/5)- I liked the sour juicy bites of pineapples with the classic fried rice, otherwise it's quite mediocre   //ATMOSPHERE// Loved the interior decoration, very bold and photogenic. Especially it being pride month, there were tons of rainbow flags/banners!"}
{"text":"I came Sunday dinner, there was no wait or reservations required. We tried the soft shell crab pad Thai, medium spicy. I liked how it came with mangos. The edible crab shell is very interesting to try, it's fried similar to crab tempura!   I can handle spicy foods and my favorite spice level is usually medium at most Asian establishments. I stayed on the safe side and ordered medium since as some reviews said Thai spicy was REALLY spicy. Medium turned out to be not spicy at all, I could not taste ANY spiciness.   Overall it was a lot of food and I ended up taking half of it to go, for leftovers the day after. I felt like the noodles to other ingredients ratio was really high, but it's the same issue I've noticed with other pad Thai places. Overall it's pretty good!"}
{"text":"there's a reason why we keep on going back...the buckets, the food, the friendly service."}
