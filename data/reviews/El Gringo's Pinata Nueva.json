{"text":"I've been here a few times because my friends keep wanting to go here for Sunday lunch.  But we are not sure we will be back.  Food is decent.  Chips and Salsa are good as well.  That is the only reason why I give this place 2 stars.  Now here are the reasons why it lacks.  Service is horrible.  We were the only people in the whole restaurant during Sunday lunch and the waiter made a BIG deal about us wanting to use three tables put together instead of two and even provided unwanted attitude as well.  He is also the same waiter that is unwilling to make separate checks as well even though we asked for this in the beginning during previous visits.  In my opinion, I think this was done so he can charge the mandatory gratuity.  Hello! Just because you have separate checks, doesn't mean you can't charge for this.  Service is not very accommodating.  Don't expect much when you go."}
{"text":"Finally!! The old owner is back and they gave the place a little TLC. It feels like it used to and the food is fannntastic. I critique Mexican in the the first 5 min when dipping into the chips and salsa, and let me say that they are A grade in my book. Thin, crispy, fresh chips, and their homemade salsa is perfect consistency with the right amount of kick. Plus, I asked for custom order and they served it with a smile. I'm very happy to have this place back on track in the neighborhood again. OH, and the margaritas are great...(very important)."}
{"text":"Monday nights are the best with $3 margs! Drama the rest of the week - filled local celebs throwing fits (over Mexican food - go figure) Service is best on Monday"}
{"text":"Great place.  The food and service now is nothing like it has been for the past year or so.  The new owner has definitely turned this place around.  The street tacos are very good and authentic style with the small, fresh corn tortillas - excellent. My wife had a margarita and she was thrilled with it.  I have no idea why it is so hard to get a great margarita in this city, but this one is a winner.  We also tried one of the appetizers, which was essentially a quesadilla with chili colorado. It tasted great.  The flour tortilla was not as good as the corn tortillas in the taco, but the filling was tasty.  A minor upgrade to some locally made fresh tortillas would make this a stunning dish.  I would also recommend serving some Yucatan-style habanero sauce and avocado sauce with the street tacos.   Service was friendly and fast.    It would be nice if Yelp would allow the restaurant to reboot its ratings after changing management.  The nueva pinata nueva deserves a much higher rating."}
{"text":"Return of previous owner has brought back some wonderful Mexican food.  Had a shredded chicken queso dip that had a great taste and consistency.  The margarita was done right.  Glad that I tried the restaurant again and was pleased with the results"}
{"text":"We go out to eat a lot. I cannot remember the last time I walked out of a restaurant, it happened tonight. I have food allergies and explained very clearly to the waitress. She continued to bring out food that I was allergic to. The wait staff speaks English so the problem wasn't there. The only thing we got to eat were chips and salsa...the chips were good."}
{"text":"Wow ! Ok the truth hurts Mr.James H  what I wrote was all true !!! I get you work there so want to protect your job ! Yelp is for restaurant reviews and it's not high school ...."}
{"text":"Last time I went there, I did a pickup order. I was overcharged $10 and when I went back to show the older lady the mistake she made, she never apologized and was very, VERY rude. Even after being treated badly, I asked to talk to a manager and she looked at me and said, \"I am the manager\". It was horrible. Because of her and her attitude, I would never go back.   It's too bad because the food is decent."}
{"text":"zero stars wasnt enough...the \"manager\" alex put his \"manager\" on the phone and called me a jack ass while on hold...maybe I don't work for a fortune 500 company but I do know there is only one person in charge of a mexican take out place...  this manager asked my girfriend for her phone number....the food was bland and tasteless. Avoid this place at all costs. Limited menu and terrible service....I am calling board of heath too. there is no way this company is in compliance with health conditions...serving food with dirty dishes? how can that be? ZERO STARS"}
{"text":"this place has good, but not great food, very reasonable and I go often for lunch as it is close to where I work and the service is fast and friendly.  They have a cute bar but I have not been for happy hour or drinks, since I usually go for a work lunch.  I like their food and prices are low."}
{"text":"Drove down to El Gringo's tonight after having a good meal a month ago only to find a sign on next to the door saying they are no longer honoring their own restaurant.com coupons.  There was no further explanation given.   I turned around and walked off.    If you just (re)took over the place and are trying to repair a tarnished reputation (just look at many of the previous reviews) why would you do this?  Very unprofessional.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Just left Piñata Nueva for the second night in a row.  Food was excellent.   Great salsa, flavorful enchilada sauce... Just had to return. The only disappointment was the waitress we had on second night.   Portions are plentiful.   So much better than Macayos and Manuels  We will go back again but will be sure to ask for Mark"}
{"text":"!!!!!!!!!STOP HOARDING THE SALSA VERDE!!!!!!!  I went here for lunch one day randomly and had an awesome experience.  It was busy, but I had great service the food was delicious and the price was right. I was served this awesome green salsa. So delicious that when I told them how much I enjoyed it, they sent me home with a to go container of green salsa which my entire family got hooked on. We went there for dinner the NEXT DAY!!!! We asked for this magical green salsa and were told they NEVER HAD IT?!?!?!?! What?! Their available salsa.... mediocre.  The food here is good. It's down the street from our house and we've enjoyed the food and would eat here more, but C'MON! Give us the goods!!!! We have asked each time! How can you just keep it to yourselves?!  Here's my advice. Eat here. it's good, but..... DEMAND THE GREEN SALSA!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant.  I have eaten at this restaurant about 40 times over the last 4 years.  The margaritas are the best, and the food tastes great, but the service gets worse and worse each time I go.  Unfortunately 11/242010 was the last straw.  We will not go back.  There was not enough waitstaff, as usual, the order was messed up about 5 different ways, and the food took 45 minutes to come out.  The waitress apologized to us and gave us a free dessert, but tonight was the last straw. Sorry, Pinata Nueva.  We will miss your fabulous margaritas, but I'm not going to waste any more time waiting for your service to improve."}
{"text":"You wouldn't know it from the outside, but Pinata Nueva is a hidden Mexican food gem located in North Scottsdale.  If you've driven through the shopping complex there, you've probably seen it, but passed on by. My recommendation is to stop next time for a nice lunch or dinner in their wonderfully air conditioned restaurant.   The restaurant is small, but it is vibrantly decorated, with yellow, red and blue colored paint on various walls and countless piata's hanging from the ceiling.  I'm talking Santa, the Easter bunny, a ghost, stars, bears...they all make an appearance in this restaurant in the form of multi-colored piatas.  I think the food here is really good.  I LOVED the chips and salsa and ordered a bean burrito enchilada style for my meal ( I know, boring!).  My boyfriend ordered their lunch special, which was $6 for an enchilada, rice and beans.  My burrito ended up being around $5 something, but it was huge.    Their happy hour starts at 3pm, and they have some great specials.  $2 margaritas!! Woo hoo! I was extremely tempted, but since I was drinking later on, I passed.    I can tell this place doesn't get that much business yet...I think it's because they're located in the back of a shopping plaza and you'd have to be in the shopping plaza to even see them, so they probably don't get any drive-by traffic.  In my opinion, I think Pinata Nueva is way better than Macayo's and just as good as Carlos O'Brien's, if not better. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great location, respectable food, and really nice people. But the place really needs to be decorated by a professional. Not that they need to spend a fortune or completely gut it - just add some booths, paint, lighting, remove most of the tacky piñatas, and hire someone with an eye to do it. The ambiance just isn't. Sorry guys..."}
{"text":"Gotta get rid of the sewer odor!  Price goes up, food goes down.  Used to eat here once or twice a week for a couple years in a row- 2005-2007.  Now every time I go back, it is a bigger disappointment."}
{"text":"The last two times I have been here the place had an odd stench to it, kind of like a dirty rag... big turn off.  Also, the food did not taste as good.  Since I usually order the exact same thing here, I know how it should taste.  Perhaps the bad smell skewed my taste buds or something.  I will probably not go back."}
