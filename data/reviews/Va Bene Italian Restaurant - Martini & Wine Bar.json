{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! My husband and I both loved our meals. The restaurant is very nice and great for a date night. Authentic, homemade Italian food. Would absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"I've gone twice now, and it was better the first time, but let's see if the third time's the charm. Cute little place tucked away in a little outlet, much prettier from the inside! You've gotta try the escargot, it's so delicious you want to lick the plate--and I don't even like snails! 

Warning: do not fill up on the delicious bread they give you! Also, while the creme brulee was alright, I wouldn't recommend ordering it, as it's supposed to be firm, not watery. Other than that, the service is good and the pasta is as well!"}
{"text":"My wife and I come here for happy hour all the time. The atmosphere in the bar is awesome (the decor is great) and we always feel like we are on a mini-vacation. The drink and food specials are great as well. We treat it as a meal and have a great dinner for a great price."}
{"text":"Food quality is at an all time low...have been coming here for a decade and loved it...now positive changes will have to happen before I return...the last 3 times I have been here I have noticed a decline in menu items and food quality.  Tonight was the last straw, had to return my \"go to\" meal cause it tasted rotten.  The owners should print new menus cause the white out is beyond tacky...and serve fresh food again!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant and food was awesome. I highly recommend the gnocchi."}
{"text":"Inventive twists on traditional Italian fare. Nothing too dramatic, but everything tastes very good and the atmosphere and service are very enjoyable as well. Full bar, lots of happy hour specials and live music/dancing on the weekends. Fun place!"}
{"text":"I just celebrated a birthday this past Saturday night and this place did not disappoint. It's the second night the lady and I had reservations and it was quiet, romantic and they also had a rib eye special that I could not pass up.  The wait staff were friendly, punctual and funny. We then later headed inside the bar area where they had a live band playing."}
{"text":"I held my 50th birthday here. There were a ton of separate checks. The food was great as always and our service amazing. A server Dillon whom I had never met made a point of knowing everyone's name. Great time. Great music!"}
{"text":"Va Bene never fails.  Wonderful ambiance. Consistent high quality food. Excellent friendly service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday right at open.  Ambiance was great. Such a shame that the decor and comfort of the restaurant doesn't translate to the food. We first had calamari which was far from good. All I could taste is oil and mayo. For a genuine Italian restaurant,  it was terrible. I had the seafood main dish which had scallops, shrimp, mussels, etc. I would rate it a 6/10, the pasta itself was way overcooked. The server Denny, only checked on us ONCE the entire hour and a half we were there,  so customer service was also terrible.  On the flip side,  the salad that came with the calamari was very good. Finally we had tirsmisu for desert and that was also very good. Rated it a one due to mediocre food and terrible customer service. Maybe it's because I was spoiled with amazing Italian food when I lived in Chicago....."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and it never disappoints! Recently we went and had the flank steak special wrapped with red peppers, Gorgonzola cheese, and spinach. My boyfriend opted to not get the special but after trying mine was upset he hadn't ordered the same. I'd have to say that was one of the best steak meals I have ever had! I wish I knew when or if they were going to make that again because we would be there in a heart beat. Highly recommend this place because they're food is delicious."}
{"text":"I've come here on Saturday night and the atompshere is awesome. I've also come here on a lunch date & the food is great."}
{"text":"Amazing! I cannot remember the last time I had great italian food but this, by far, is the best! I am hesitant to share with friends and family because I don't want to give away my new secret place but it is too darn good to keep to myself. I highly recommend this restaurant. My husband and I will definitely go back for more of their outstanding italian cuisine. 

The only con to this restaurant is that it does not appear to be well suited for children which is not bad since I enjoy having a date night with my hubby alone anyway. The ambiance and decor of the restaurant is very nice and classy too. I loved it. Definitely makes you feel like you're stepping into an italian bistro. 

Please try it. I think you will be glad that you did."}
{"text":"Such a fabulous place to wine and dine! My boyfriend and I have been coming here for the past 4 months or so, and have eaten in the restaurant + take out. Prompt service, romantic, decently priced for the environment and the food is absolutely wonderful. Many great memories here. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is NOT your neighborhood Olive Garden in the heart of the Ahwatukee Foothills...this is Italian cooking at its best. The ambiance is fit for that \"I-must-impress-her\" first date or that \"darn-I-forgot-our anniversary-again\" make-up and make-out dinner. 

The ambiance is cozy and classy (white linens, and no red check table cloths) the staff are attentive and knowledgeable about the food...now that's important, especially if you don't understand Italian.

They serve lunch, and I've had their smoked chicken fettucine pasta, which is one of their lunch specials ($9-10?). The sauce was excellent--creamy, but not heavy, and punctuated with the saltiness of pancetta, if I'm not mistaken. The chicken was cooked (maybe grilled) just right, a bit on the smoky side to add another texture to the overall flavor. 

Now if you are on that date--whether it be with your spouse, significant other, or whomever--you HAVE to start your dinner with some cocktails and appetizers at the bar, where they have Happy Hour from 4-7 p.m. Tues-Saturdays. The appetizers (calamari, baby!) are half-off, plus drink specials. 

Bellissimo! I'm telling you..."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner with the wife! Small, dark, quiet and the staff is very kind and professional. Love their pasta dishes. Will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for more of a Lounge hang out with good drinks and live music -with even a small dance floor --check this place out!  You can go for dinner -and stay for the live band and evening interaction -or just plan to go during happy hour or after 8p.m to enjoy the bar area where the band camps out!  The music is always fabulous for listening and dancing if you choose.  The crowd has appeared to be 45+ on the times I have visited -and very lively and interactive -but still laid back with the lounge feel.  I only rate it a 4 instead of a 5 because the last few visits were a bit of a wait for drinks when the bar was far from full.  All the staff members are very pleasant and helpful!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here many times over the span of about 6 years. Every time the food is great and we enjoy the experience. My wife usually gets the Fettuccine Con Pollo & Fungi and I either get the same or the New York Steak. Both are fantastic. My steak is always cooked perfect and the sauce is great. The only drawback for me is it is sometimes the lighting is a little too low, and I feel it is a little spendy but it is worth the price."}
{"text":"Came in with my husband and daughter after a long day and night of working the business myself and it was like 9:05pm and they close at 10. We get greeted after a minute and was told sorry kitchen is closed. My husband asks why and his response was its been a slow day. That's it no sorry or can we get you something for your next visit nothing. Wow well no wonder your not very busy when you have service like that and you close early because you don't feel like staying open. Way to run a business I tell ya. Don't know if we will be returning and hopefully I can take down my 5star I gave them when we first tried this place. SMH what a joke!"}
{"text":"We started our date night here and were very disappointed. We were looking for wine and live music and found this on Yelp. We arrived at 7:30 for dinner, but the music here does not start until 9:00. That's on us - but just so you know, it starts at 9:00, a bit too late for dinner. The servers spent more time chatting at the bar than serving their tables.
We ordered the lamb and it was very fatty. We were scrapping fat off the top to get to the meat. I rarely turn food down, but I couldn't eat this dish.  We decided to order dessert to pass the time and wait for the music to start. The cheesecake was not fresh or made in house. We decided to go back to yelp and see if we could find another wine bar near by  to save our night. Check out My Wine Cellar for better food, service, pricing and music."}
{"text":"What an amazing mid morning lunch I had at VaBene Restaurant.  I dined divinely, I felt like a queen being served ALL delicious foods, the ambience of the atmosphere was absolutely delightful as my head bobbed to the soothing, smooth jazz, soooo relaxing. I was in a wonderful zone accompanied by me, myself, and I.  I just had a Grand old time.  I started out with an ice tea, tasting the tea leaves distinctively, which was really good, great soup and salad, I had the works! um good! yum, yum, yummy, blackened shrimp in my warm spinach salad.  It was very good, the warmness of the salad was different and I liked it!   I requested no alcohol in any of my food and was obliged by the chief.  My entrée veal parmigiana was made specifically for me without any alcohol and delicious.  I conclude that I was very impressed with my service, food, atmosphere and manager interaction.  I felt very welcomed and not at all awkward dining alone.  I would return in a heartbeat, I had an excellent experience at VaBene!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere.  Terrific service and drinks.  The food is good but not out of this world, thats the only reason its not a 5 star.  Great place to take somebody you want to impress."}
{"text":"The band on Saturday night was extremely good. Can't comment on the food since I've not eaten there and the wine list lacked substance. These stars are for the band only."}
{"text":"Unimpressed with food, service was slow. Took 10 minutes before our waiter approached the table, when he did he asked if we were ready to order didn't even offer to get us drinks. The food was bland, calamari chewy and clams were fishy. Don't waste you money."}
{"text":"Most delicious Italian food outside of Italy. Decently priced and professional, friendly service. I would highly recommend the Gnocchi, it is rich in flavor and melts in your mouth. Had an amazing Chicken Alfredo, the missus had chicken saltimbocha that was to die for. You will not regret choosing this place, YES!"}
{"text":"It was a pleasure to dine here. The service was good. The waiters knowledgeable about both the menu and the wine list. The food was well prepared and nicely presented. I dined with two friends. We all ordered different dishes which we thoroughly enjoyed. The portions were more than amble. The ambience was nice. Loved the decor and the fact we could carry on a conversation with normal voices. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"The server was very inattentive here.  It was our anniversary and this was poor experience.  The server never checked back and was so absent from the table we couldn't even order wine.  I food was just ok.   My wife wanted salmon and they had run out at 6:30 on a Friday.  

The kicker is my open table email stating we didn't show for our reservation.   Makes since because we did feel invisible. 

We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing Service. There's a band that plays on Saturday night which is pretty cool, if you want to sit and talk they have a separate dinning room."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed I like this restaurant.  And the decor and service is good.   My wife and I had dinner  Tuesday night.   I had pasta rigatoni and my wife asked about the special.    It sounded good a white fish grouper I think.  With a bed of a pasta.     It was ok nothing to write home about.   My pasta was good as usual under $15.     But when I got the bill $28.00 for the fish plate.  It was worth half  at best. And the waiter said nothing of the price      I have learned a lesson at this restaurant, no specials for us and I will alway have the sting of $28 for the fish.      For the owners have your staff announce the price of your specials.   It felt like a scam in a tourist area.    And if you have a $28 plate make it worth it."}
{"text":"I don't mind this place for a drink and some live music on a Saturday night, but I would never return for dinner. I feel like a $30 plate of fish should be better cooked than what I can do at home, and it just wasn't. It was fine but nothing special. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"First time and not very impressed. Food was good. Service was horrible. Waited. Waited. Waited. Waited. Waited! And there was no apologies for the amount of time we waited to order a drink. And waiting for our waiter to take our payment. We literally had to walk to the hostesses desk. They wouldn't take our payment and told us to wait for our waiter. Waiter had a big party but made our table of 2 feel like an inconvenience or not a priority. So .... a lot of waiting. Disappointed."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time. Atmosphere is awesome, food exceptional. Service was really good. We were pleasantly actually shocked by how reasonable the final bill was. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a great classy  place to go dancing on Friday or Saturday night. Great Live music. I have only had appetizers so  can't comment on the food yet. But I will update as soon as I go back for dinner."}
{"text":"We came to celebrate our fathers birthday. We had a reserved table 18. The food was amazing and the service was exceptional. It's a very nice atmosphere inside. Newly remodeled, and it's beautiful inside, very romantic. Our beg group
Party had a variety of entrees, but the best was their gnocchi. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best food in Phoenix for italian!! The Waiter Sergio was very nice and very funny. Gnochi is amazing and fresh can't ever find any fresh gnochi except here. For desert the tiramisu is the best I have had not including Italy. Overall this is the best place to go to for Italian food!!! :)"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything you order off the menu. Happy hour is a great mix of the Ahwatukee crowd. Very efficient wait staff. Great restaurant for date night!"}
{"text":"Bought a voucher on Living Social and I'm glad I did! Very nicely decorated restaurant and attentive service. The menu is extensive with a lot of authentic Italian dishes. I had the linguine Putenesca which had tons of capers and olives, fresh tomatoes and a light tomato sauce. Heavenly if you love capers ant olives like I do. My husband had an Alfredo type pasta which completely bores me but he liked it. Tiramisu is not my \"to die for\" dessert so we shared one and it was very well done; rich flavors but not overly sweet. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Visited Va Bene during a Sunday all day happy hour.  Prices are great, lots of drink and food specials. 

Grey Goose Martini's - $6
Well's - $3
Nice House Wine Options, I believe $4 or $5

Bartender was very pleasant and attentive, recommended a pizza dish that was not even on the menu and it was absolutely fabulous for $12 and fed both of us with 2 extra slices leftover.  

Minus a few exceptions, all appetizers were half off and there was quite a selection to choose from, antipasto platters, bruschetta, clams, etc.

Highly recommend this place for a happy hour trip."}
{"text":"Nice place for a dinner date or party. Food is great! Has a nice patio too! Only complaint, is the female bartender ignored me for 10 minutes as I stood waiting to order a glass of wine. (She looked at me a couple times) then finally another employee came over to take my order."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here, ridiculously well priced for the quality of food and service. The ambience is very nice and classy but do not be intimidated, for lunch everyone was casually dressed, jeans and even shorts.  Bread with awesome sun dried tomato basil butter is complimentary.  The appetizers looked phenomenal, with mostly seafood options, we couldn't decide what to order as a group so we unfortunately didn't try any =( I had the Penne con Brocolli, the garlic butter sauce was the best I've had, I mopped the rest of it off the plate with the fresh bread they kept refilling our baskets with. yummmmmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would! I went online to their website, made a reservation at 9:45 because my husband gets off at 9. I was hoping to surprise him. I received a call from Illeana telling me they don't take reservations past 8. I proceeded to tell her that option shouldn't be available on the website. Her response was, \"Yeah, we've been trying to fix that.\" What a disappointment. Now I'm trying to trade my Groupon and go to an establishment that has their stuff together!"}
{"text":"Va Bene was the second dinner my fiancee and I had in Phoenix.  First was a Mexican food chain where the waiter greeted us with a free dessert sampler after spending countless minutes describing our new home (while dealing with 4-5 other tables, too), so we weren't expecting much.  On the contrary, we were extremely pleased by what we found.

Our bartender, Randy, remembered us on our second visit which was over a month after our first.  Now, we go as often as I'm home and enjoy a solid happy hour filled with cheap well drinks, beers, house wines, and half-price apps.  After a few drinks and an appetizer or two, we're always ready cross the street to our apartment and \"cook.\"  

Va Bene features live music at least once per week and is loaded with cougars, so bring your magnums if you're in the mood to hunt...  Great atmosphere, great service, and high-quality Italian food are enough for me any day."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I have had in AZ.  Pasta dishes are fantastic.  Meat entres are above average but not to level of their pasta."}
{"text":"My visit to Va Bene was a tale of two meals. Since a salad doesn't come with your entree, I ordered a caesar salad, big mistake! The salad was awful. The salad was small and the dressing tasted almost like mayo. I had my wife take a bite to make sure I wasn't wrong in my assessment. 

When the server asked how the salad was, I honestly told her the salad wasn't good. The look on her face was priceless. I sucked it up and ate my salad. I hate to see $9 go down the drain.

My meal was better. I had the Rigatoni, sausage, peppers in a cream sauce.  I liked the dish quite a bit, but I was still a little scorned from the salad fiasco. 

Entree 4 stars
Salad 0  stars

The service was decent. The inside was nice and had a nice atmosphere. I can see why people like this place.  To me, this place is more flash.

I don't plan to head back to this place. If you do go, I'd avoid the salad. I think other Italian places in the area give you better food at the same/cheaper rate and overall provide better value for your dollar.

Just my 2 cents."}
{"text":"This is one of the finest Italian restaurants in the valley.. no doubt !! 

You get a Italian feeling right from the beginning because even the waiter speaks like a a true italian... Menu has a wide spread choice. Being vegetarians, we always have less of a choice in fine dining places, but not this one.

We ordered the soup of the day \" Tomato Basil\", Margarita Pizza and Pasta Fusciliana ! Oh what yummy pasta !! The cheese on the pizza would just melt in your mouth. We were so full with these 3 that we cold order any dessert. So I am definitely going here again to taste the wide variety of desserts !!"}
{"text":"What a great place for a happy hour martini, beer, great food, elegant atmosphere, and attentive service at a reasonable price.  It gets busy, so go early for happy hour and make a reservation for dinner."}
{"text":"As always, Va Bene is wonderful.  The atmosphere, service and food all hit the mark.  I met a g/f for lunch and, after a couple of sample tastings, we each had a glass of red wine and the special beef & feta salad.  Delicious.  We ended up being there over 2 hours.  The service continued to be attentive the whole time without rushing us.  The only thing I would change is for you to get a location in the North Valley!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here with my 8-year old daughter after a day at the museum. I was a little embarrassed because I had on street clothes and sneakers and the restaurant is so pretty and sophisticated.. and maybe not the best place for my 9-year old. We were hungry and I had the Groupon that was going to expire, so we went in anyway. It was just delicious. The food was homemade, yet still came out in a timely manner. My daughter had the alfredo with shrimp and I had the gnocchi with pesto. It was so good and homemade and fresh. My mouth waters as I write this."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Best kept secret in Ahwatukee!  Food is great, great drink deals...even on a Friday night!  The owner is so cool and down to earth and genuinely cares that you have a good time here.  It's so much more than a wine bar and restaurant.  Give it a shot and you'll become a regular, guaranteed!"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets in the east valley.  They are opening a new location in Chandler in the fall of 2012.  We ate at Tutti Santi in Tempe this week also, and had a 2 star dining experience.  It has gone way down."}
{"text":"We went one night for dinner because this was only place in chandler open for late night dinner. 
Food was decent. Place was full of people."}
{"text":"We should have stayed in the bar area to have dinner. Tyler gave us amazing service for drinks and appetizers. We  were greeted by our waiter in the dining room when we arrived. I couldn't tell you his name because he did not tell us (Italian accent!). He was not friendly and very short with us while taking our order. When we asked for a specific side dish he was very annoyed. He clearly did not want to be there. Too expensive for not so great food! 
Not worth going there at all!"}
{"text":"i really don't get it. All these great reviews make you all excited about going there for dinner. It is a cafetaria quality dinner, served by someone who really does want to be here. Got the ribeye special, ordered Medium, came Well Done. Mashed potatoes and greens beans was fresh out the the freezer. My wife's pasta was nothing to rave about, and our guests' food was about the same. What bugged me the most was the service. Inexistant. the \"server\" never smiled, never showed enjoyment, he ruined our experience. Like I said, feed me but serve me like you mean it. Mission failed at Va Bene. But still, I would be curious to try the left side of the restaurant... just to see if we went there on a bad day."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant.  I went this past weekend with a friend and am SO happy we did. This is one of the few Italian restaurants with actual have Italian servers, and authentic Italian food.  I haven't had home made Gnoki like that since my Nana passed years ago. BRAVO Va Bene!!!! I will be back many more times."}
{"text":"Ovo je jedan od najboji rstorana sto sam ja I mja spruga posetili. Hrana je bila fantasncna. Uslug jos bolja."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place gets such good reviews. We went for dinner last night because it always looks crowded. Atmosphere is a good one for clandestine meetings great music and service was good. But the food was awful. Cesar salad dressing (too much) was bottled, my spaghetti bolognese (tough to mess up) was greasy tasting. Very little flavor. Hubby's Sspecial was orange roughy with seemingly boxed potatoes, steamed green beans and again, no seasoning. Not cheap either...$65 without drinks. AND we had to find a bathroom on the way home.
 'nuff said."}
{"text":"Though it's hard to compare Italian and New Mexican cuisine, I vote Va Bene our best dining experience of five days in restaurant-laden Phoenix.

Waiter was superb; wine list, great; all five entrees at our table were pronounced \"excellent\".  I later dreamed about my pasta with chicken, mushroom in a creamy sauce.  For dessert: wonderful tiramisu.

Like many area finds, Va Bene is in a strip mall.  It's inconsequential once you step in the door.

Go here when you've had a bellyful of everything chile-related."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding, we have been here several times and we are never disappointed. The wait staff is very friendly, we always feel taken care of. The ambiance is very calming and sexy."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in tukee hands down. Incredible HAPPY hour. Don't know what's better ... The bacon wrapped shrimp with that incredible sauce , the bisque , or that homemade butter with the bread. Service is always perfection. Both owner and manager sasha are always eager to please with great service and awesome meals. Would recommend for any happy hour , special occasion , or a romantic date night out."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian restaurant I've been to in Phoenix yet. We ordered the caprese salad for the appetizer and it was spot on. The tomato basil soup was delicious. For our entree, we got the frutti de mare and linguine puttanesca which were both amazing! The frutti de mare had plenty seafood n wasn't digging to find the seafood. It wasn't overwhelmed with pasta. The linguine dish had capers, olives and anchovies and had an amazing flavor. We ordered both dishes spicy and it didn't disappoint. The server was very attentive which made our experience even better. Highly recommend. Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Wow is an understatement! It has been several years since I've eaten at Va Bene Italian Restaurant. Celebrating my birthday with my husband and son on Dec. 19 was a special dining experience. I have no idea what they do to their Calamari Rings, but this was an appetizer extraordinaire. There was a special sauce that was extremely tasty, but the rings themselves were prepared in a way to make them very soft. I have eaten this appetizer at many different restaurants, but this is hands down the best. They kept bringing a basket of sliced bread with a orange-colored butter that was exquisite to the tongue. Then the main course of a chicken with fettucine was very well prepared. The healthy portion allowed me to take some home and much to my surprise heated up well two days later. The Server and Manager were very attentive also. I have no qualms about recommending Va Bene in Ahwatukee for a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant. The server was a huge sweetheart think his name was Dylan not positive but he was great always checking on me, making great conversation and even gave a sample of two different domestic red wines. The chicken with fettuccine and mushroom was amazing the sauce was light not overwhelming. The atmosphere was nice as well. I live in Los Angeles but if I ever come back to visit I'm definitely coming here."}
{"text":"I had my sons graduation dinner here. The food was perfect and the service was amazing.  They were very attentive to details. Everyone loved the food and desserts."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight. They have a great patio and a huge indoor bar. I had the chicken Alfredo and it was delicious. Huge menu too including quite a few pasta dishes, pizza, salads and a variety of non pasta main courses. Service was great too. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never been here before!! I came with my family and had a great experience. We sat in the dining room which is beautiful and our server told us they had recently renovated the entire restaurant. The decor is warm and inviting in the dining room and the lounge, very tasteful and romantic. The wine reccomendations from our server were spot on and we also had amazing after dinner martini's. The bartenders really know how to make a special drink!

One thing I have to mention..... I have been to Italy several times, and the Gnocchi Ala Vodka is one of the best I've ever had! My mom ordered the Pollo Marsala, which was AMAZING. We were all very impressed to say the least. I could go on about the dishes we ordered but there were 12 of us and that could take a while.  All in all, we had a great experience, amazing food, and friendly service! Even the manager of the restaurant came by to talk with us, he was very personable and professional! Vabene is a gem!"}
{"text":"I come from an Italian house who take food very seriously so when I read some of the good review I was expecting good food. To my surprise it seems I should have paid more attention to the negative ones. Again I come from new Haven , CT where some of the best Italian food is and I can assure you I know fresh good Italian food and this was not it. Calamari should be light flour seasoned batter and what I was served was an onion ring type batter which was a bit oil saturated drenched in a type of mayonnaise. I also had  gnocchi alla vodka where there gnocchi was under cooked and sauce was just OK  a bit bitter. But I will say the most disgraceful thing was the seafood bisque it was no more than tomato soup with a single shrimp in the center . Seafood bisque should be creamy rich and vibrant also should have traces of seafood lol. !!!"}
{"text":"Ate and drank here in the bar last Saturday. We were on the early side so it wasn't too busy but became steady towards the end of Happy Hour. 
Drink: I suggest Martinis. They are generous and the HH liquor is a descent selection. Also, trust their bartenders. Give them an idea of what you like and let them create. Aldo made us a guava one that was great. 
Eat: Grilled Veggie Appetizer. I am not sure what they do that makes this so good but we get it almost every time. Calamari. Good. Both at half price for HH. We ordered the gnocchi to split and it was great. No ridiculous split plate change either. 

We will be back again. 

Regarding the Groupon. It is a good deal if you miss Happy Hour or sit in the dining room. We went for HH and the Groupon doesn't apply."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing experience- have Berta Va Bene fan for years but last night I felt like it was all about the money!!!!! The bar is I see renovation and was my Marti it the quality and price of happy hour - NO!!   In addition for a $20 pasta I do t expect to detail and shell my pasta. What a mess. Shame on you !  I'm definitely rethinking ALL the recommendations I've given. 

My even mentioning our entrees being misdelivered at our table. I am mourning my years of happiness at Va Bene"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is beautiful. Waiter not so good brought bread out and then took plates and remaining bread away before salads, soups etc were even served. I ordered minestrone soup with pesto for lunch, it was like a clear broth (no flavor) and a can of mixed vegetables thrown in, no pasta, no flavor at all. I added pepper and Parmesan still not enough. Think twice about coming here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go with the Italian family! The servers are amazing and very personable. Plus the Rigatoni Alla Bolognese is to die for. You MUST order this, you'll be happy you did. Also the lamb shanks are outstanding."}
{"text":"Va Bene just doesn't disappoint. Had dinner here this evening with the bf.  I had the Penne Salmone -- just delicious and extremely filling, so much so, that the bf got a nice chunk of it.  The bf had the Bassa Florentina of which I had a small sample -- very good too.  It's nice they have a separate dining area since the lounge can get quite loud.  May be a good place to dance as well -- don't know; will have to try it some time."}
{"text":"My all time favorite restaurant! This place has a great atmosphere and amazing food. I have been going there regularly for years and the staff and service are fantastic.
Every client, or date I have brought there were impressed and quickly became new customers themselves."}
{"text":"Coming from Pittsburgh, we didn't think we would get good Italian food in Arizona. Va Bene proved us wrong. Not only was the food excellent, the service was even better!  We were a little nervous when they put us in a back room by ourselves with our 3 children (very good kids but under 10), but it was actually ideal... we had the room to ourselves. They took their time on serving and the food was authentic. The gnocchi was a little overcooked but the manager (can't remember his name) and server, Sergio, made it right. They were both great (as were the bus boys) and made our experience at this restaurant perfect. Veal Parm (not on the menu) and Veal Marsala was delicious, as were the sides. If you're looking for great, authentic Italian food in the Phoenix area, this is definitely your place... for kids and adults alike! Highly recommend by a 100% Italian!"}
{"text":"Fabulous!
The food was superb and the staff was friendly and fun!
We'll be back next time we're in the area..."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian Restaurant.  Great food, and drinks, and the service is a hit. My husband and I love the ambience."}
{"text":"Really good Italian food.  I had the grouper, which was delicious.  Good champagne split, nice wait staff.  Friends with us had other items on the menu, which were equally as good!"}
{"text":"So we've been sitting here for an hour now since we put in our order and still no food.  Normally, I'm quick to forgive... Especially when offered an apology, which we were.  The manager assured us our order was corrected and that the food would be here soon.  That was 25 minutes ago.  Ugh.... Won't be coming back here again.  I don't care how good the food is.... If it ever comes, that is."}
{"text":"This is a real authentic Italian food place. Everything is fresh so you can make your own personal adjustments to the ordered menu items (no mushrooms et). They quite often have discounts deals on Groupon!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great prices for italian cuisine.on to of that $5 Absolut vodka anyway you like it and life music on the weekends after 9.great for a date our just hanging with friends"}
{"text":"Excellent the food was amazing. Boris was a excellent server. We started out with Sasha the manager he was good too.  We were the only ones in the dining room but they made sure to stop by often to see if we needed anything. I had the Calamari Fritti and Salad \" Va Bene\". My husband had the Linguine Frutti di Mare.  It was a wonderful place to celebrate our 36 wedding anniversary."}
{"text":"My girlfriend friend and I had dinner there on Saturday February 2nd.  We didn't have reservations but we were seated without a wait.
 We ordered the Calamari and the eggplant appetizers. The calamari appeared to be preprepared portion controlled rings of uniform size. The flavor was bland . The eggplant on the other hand wasn't bad
Probably not going back
It used to be a much better place
I understand they have a new manager and a server agreed the place had gone downhill."}
{"text":"We spent over three hours here on a Saturday night and were treated to good service, good food, and good music. We ate in the bar, which offers full dining service and a close-up view of the dance floor after 9. Drinks were reasonably priced with generous pours. We ordered the caprese as a starter and were happy with both the size of the portion and the freshness of the tomatoes and mozzarella. We used some of the complimentary bread to finish off the balsamic vinegar and olive oil that remained on the plate. For dinner, my partner had the chicken marsala which was cooked perfectly and accompanied by a small serving of mashed potatoes. I had the salmon, also cooked to perfection, served on a bed of roasted potatoes and green beans. Too often, restaurant chefs kill the vegetables and serve what amounts to limp mushy stuff but that was not the case here. The beans were al dente and flavorful and the potatoes were crispy without being overcooked. Our great meal was topped off by good music from the evening's cover band, Uncorked, making for a very pleasant Saturday date night!"}
{"text":"Went for a birthday gathering there last Friday.  

The wine list was excellent and we went with a bottle of Kendall Jackson Chardonnay.  The presentation was excellent and the wine was kept at about the right temperature.  

For appetizers, we ordered the Escargot and the Scallops.  I must say, the escargot came out completely different than what I had expected.  It came out in a soft, flaky pastry, and could be separated out in 4 pieces.  It was extremeley done to perfection!  The scallops were also excellent, and the presentation was superb.

I opted for the Linguine Vongole (pasta and clams in a white wine sauce).  I've had this dish at several other places, and I must say this was the best one I've had so far.  

The only 'downer' of the whole night was that our table was placed near the band, and it was a little distracting trying to talk over them.  Kind of hard for 10 people to have casual conversations to Journey.  :)

All in all, it was a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"The server was friendly. The calamari was rubbery and lacked flavor. The Cesar's were not great, I make better at home. The Marsala was horrible I could not even eat it. The salmon in my daughters pasta was over cooked. Based on the reviews I was expecting this amazing meal. The tiramisu was great but would not go back without the meal being better. There was little flavor in anything. Sadly disappointed"}
{"text":"definitely need to try this place for lunch the gnocchi was really good different then any I have ever had service was OK but for ten bucks you can't beat it going back real soon with the family"}
{"text":"The perfect place to go to on a Friday night after the Chandler Jazz Fest - well 7 picky boys from NY say absolutely! Actually 3 for 3 at this wonderful establishment. Ate in the dining room twice prior and it was just spectacular. We went to the bar last night and were waited on by the awesome Shelly. Great wine by the glass, superb Calamari with that special sauce and then the Penne Siciliana with the eggplant and just the right amount of garlic was Bene indeed. Made me want to do my Robert de Niro \" Godfather II\"  impression \" Bene, Bene.\" We also got the Margherita pizza which was great - loved the basil. Awesome band with an amazing singer. She was very versatile and went from modern pop to good ol' Bob Marley. Dance floor was jamming. Shelly and the staff were on their game and took very good care of us. Really cool to experience this side of Va Bene after enjoying Sinatra and the other Goldies in the main restaurant with the dim lighting, great atmosphere and very, very good food. Loved it! Perfetto, Delizioso, Sorprendente."}
{"text":"If you want a \"real\" review of this place, read the one from Nicole B.  I'm just going to give you my highlights this time.

First, they had Grey Goose on special for $6.  Are you kidding me?  Where do I sign up?  I saw the sign on the patio as we were walking thru the door and I knew it was going to be a good night!  

I don't typically order calamari because everyone seems to have a version of it and it's usually not very good.  The calamari at Va Bene is thebombdotcom.  Seriously the best squid I have ever had.  For dinner I had the Risotto Mare Monte--light brandy cream sauce, shrimp, scallops, and wild mushrooms.  Very good.

The atmosphere was dark and romantic.  No one wants to have a spotlight on them with they're shoveling Italian food into their face.  It was perfect.  It was a quiet Tuesday night with only a couple other tables.  Besides, we were getting plenty of attention from the staff and other customers.  Four hot ladies do not need a spotlight.  :)"}
{"text":"Good happy hour and good service here.  Our server was there when we needed her and invisible otherwise.  So, perfect.  The happy hour prices are a pretty good deal, and the food options are a nice blend of traditional and more unique.  Try the Melanzane Ripieni - you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Best authentic Italian food I have ever had.. Their creme brûlée is out of the world!!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. I saw it reviewed on Check Please and knew I had to go. OMG the gnocchi in vodka sauce was the best i have had here in the Valley. My daughter loves calamari and she said it was so tender and flavorful that she wont order it any place else. She  also had the fungi pizza. The crust was perfect and the toppings plentiful. Best tiramisu ever and the espresso creme brulle was outstanding. I saw linguini in clam sauce looked good with plenty of clams. The bread is fresh and the compound red pepper butter is fantastic.  I just need another excuse to go back...how about tomorrow?"}
{"text":"My wife and I shared the Caesar Salad and the Margherita Pizza--pretty standard. It tasted good but not amazing. The best part of the experience was sitting outside on the patio. It was quiet and perfect for conversation."}
{"text":"Amazingly good Italian food. This is a white tablecloth, sit down and relax classy restaurant!"}
{"text":"Just went back to Va Bene with family visiting from out of town. Boris our waiter was amazing.  He recommend some amazing dishes. Our food was great as usually. We had a Groupon and it very easy to use."}
{"text":"Some of the finest Italian food my tongue has touched. Very nice dim lit atmosphere with tables surrounding a central location bar making up fine Italian food with a quality made drink to go along with."}
{"text":"Was looking for a restaurant for a date with my wife, went here and loved it. Great ambiance, and great place for a conversation. Had the clams with linguini in a white wine sauce, was amazing! Great work to the team over there!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The only downside was they ran out of some of the menu items, but what they had was great! The service was terrific and he was very helpful in making decisions between menu items. This is a great place for special occasions and romantic dinners!"}
{"text":"Me and a girl friend hit up this place on a Saturday night after going to another local hang out (which I must say was bunk after going here!) I had never been but, my friend had and so glad she recommended it. The atmosphere is very nice, a little more on the classy side, but the band playing that night, had the \"classy\" people gettin jiggy wit it! We sat at the bar, and I was a little mesmerized by the many different types of Vodka they had on display... yes, they had my favorite kind of alcohol. We had a pineapple cosmotini? I think that is what he said. All I know is, it was perfect! The band played various types of R&B soul music, and the female singer even belted out a few songs en espanol! And I must say, she definitely had an amazing voice! She got all the ladies on the dance floor!
Quick note on the decor, the lighting was dimmed, there was long floor-to-ceiling draperies, tones of cranberry red and champagne brown. I would definitely recommend for someone looking to take their special someone.  The seating was ample for the size of the place. The outside lounging area was also set up nice. Being from Cali, it is hard to compare places out here versus Cali. But, this one was definitely a more diverse place than the last joint we stopped at, and that is A-OK in my book!
I cannot comment on the food, as our experience was more for the bar scene, but we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Such a hard review to write because service at the bar is friendly and good happy hour. But the dining service is one of the worst I've ever had. Guy serving us didn't even say hello or thank us at end. He smelled so much like a cigarette it was gross. The Alfredo sauce was great but shrimp way over cooked. What a bummer."}
{"text":"This is one of the nicest Restaurant  you can find in Ahwatukee close to the busy I10 and Chandler Blvd. Wether you just stop by during happy hour or have a succulent supper try it."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT food & service! Came here on a date last week and we were both so impressed by the quality, delicious food and friendly service. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day.  Their service is excellent and their staff is experienced and friendly.  Our waiter recommended a bottle of wine that paired well with our meals.  Their menu has a number of seafood options amongst the appetizers and entrees.  We ordered the clams from the appetizer menu.  Very good.  The pasta dishes we enjoyed were the gnocchi and seafood pasta.  Both come in a vodka sauce that is outstanding.  If you are looking for a excellent Italian restaurant in Ahwatukee at a reasonable price, Va Bene is for you."}
{"text":"By the prices they were charging, I would have expected a meal that tasted less like reheated Olive Garden doused in parmesan. 

On the plus side it appeared to be 40-something-divorcee's night at the bar next door... so that was entertaining."}
{"text":"food is amazing! And the prices are so reasonable. A great spot for very fresh Italian food.
I left my wallet at the restaurant one night and the staff kept it safe for me to pick up the next day. 
Really love everything about this place, especially happy hour daily!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch and taken friends and it's always been a pleasant experiance. I have only ever gotten the Gnocchi alla Vodka  so you mileage may vary.  It's so good I never switch up what I order.

It's a nice restaurant with a cool patio and bar so you can eat outside.

Try:
- Gnocchi alla Vodka"}
{"text":"I'm always one to give my god honest opinion, so here it is..

Upon arrival to Va Bene, we were greeted by a lovely hostess who was more than helpful confirming our reservation and seating us.  A shorter italian man filled our waters immediately and blessed us with the most amazing bread and butter.  Kudos to this guy, his service was the most superior.  Then we met our waiter, he didn't seem to have a ton of knowledge of the menu, specials, or wine.  I asked for a sweet white (moscato) and it took him a minute to process, nevertheless, we continued forward.  We ordered calamari for the table, and it was pretty tasty.  I had the gnocci alla vodka and my partner had the shrimp alfredo.  My dish was less than satisfying, too much tomato and not enough parmesan.  After it was all said and done, we had plates stacked on the table so I didn't feel right ordering desert because I didn't feel like holding the plate.

Work on your service and it'll make up for the food :)"}
{"text":"The food is to die for! I'm in love with the mushroom soup and the pesto linguini. The soup in a cream based mushroom purée that is delicious! It is a large bowl and I wish they offered a cup version. The pesto linguini is smothered in a creamy pesto sauce that melts in your mouth. I can't rave enough about the food but the service is disappointing. It is extremely slow - I waited 45 minutes for a drink and over a hour for my meal. We've decided that takeout is our best option which is too bad because the ambience is inviting, warm and romantic."}
{"text":"Had the duck ravioli with mushrooms. It was a bit heavy but I couldn't put my fork down. I tried to leave at least one on my plate, but it was tough. I've been happy every time I have eaten here."}
{"text":"As my friend would say, \"This place is grown and sexy\".  Love the dim lighting and the red curtains.  I love the huge bar area. Four of us girls dined here for dinner and sat at a high table in the bar area.  Our server was friendly and attentive and the bartender even came over and chatted it up with us.  

We all had wine and I went with a Malbec.  It was a good choice recommended by the bartender.  When our server brought over bread and butter, I was so excited to see that it wasn't normal butter. I love when restaurants don't have normal butter and the sundried tomato and basil butter exceeded my butter expectations.  For starters, we shared the clams and fried calamari.  The clams were in a olive oil, garlic, and oregano broth and dipping the bread in it made it even better.  The clams were baby clams and were good, but a bit gritty.  I liked the calamari.  They were light, and even thought the garlic sauce on them was good, I'm old school Italian and would have preferred traditional marinara or fra diavlo dipping sauce.

Like many other Yelpers, I went with the Gnocchi alla Vodka.  I'm an Gnocchi snob, but Va Bene passes my Gnocchi test.  Definitely homemade, light and fluffy.  The sauce was SO flavorful.  I only ordered a half order of the Gnocchi and was kicking myself after for not getting a whole order!  

One thing I did not like about the restaurant was that the music was on a pop station.  If I'm in a nice Italian restaurant, I don't feel like listening to Lady Gaga.  I know they have live Jazz on the weekends, so why not play Jazz music on the radio every night?!"}
{"text":"Been going here since 2003 and I love it! Great food and always top notch personalized service. One of my favorite places to take the family. Highly recommended! My favorite is the veal piccata"}
{"text":"We've been dining at Va Bene for 19 years ... Nearly every meal has been perfect ... Gracious service and excellent food ... Fairly priced ... We will be back."}
{"text":"I went here this weekend with a friend we used a restaurants.com Coupon and I am so glad we went, one of the great things about  having the coupon is you have to spend a certain dollar amount and then you get to try more. We were able to have an appetizer to share, we each ordered a salad and our own Pizza and shared a desert,   the appetizer Bruschetta \"Va Bene\" was amazing  I honestly thought it was some of the best I had ever had.  the salads were amazing I had the Insalata con Rucola it had Fresh arugula with sliced apples, pecans, crumbled feta cheese in a raspberry vinaigrette. the feta cheese was so mild the flavors melded together like a dance.  The pizza I had was the Margherita and it was delicious the crust was thin yet soft and crunchy and it was just ever so lightly sauced, and totally perfect,  My friend had the Fungi Salsiccia I am not a fan at all of Mushrooms but it still looked really good. We then shared a Crème brûlée and it had a wonderful light lemon flavor. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable and the wait time for every dish was minimal. 

The dining room though was an experience in its self it was dimly lit but still full of drama and ambiance beautiful red velvet curtains on the windows and light cream sheers in the middle various painting that looked like Picasso's and the music was so Fun Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and the likes. I would most defiantly come here again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice ambience , excellent service
Went to Ve Bene for my birthday dinner . 

Food:  I had the Chicken Marsala Entre . It was very flavorful and the chicken was perfect.  For dessert we ordered creme brûlée and tiramisu.  Since it was my birthday I was given the tiramisu complimentary with a candle in it. (Very nice). We were told that the desserts were homemade . They were fantastic . 

Service : Excellent!

Ambience : We had dinner in the dining room but the also have a lounge. I loved the artwork and decor throughout the restaurant .  Our reservations were at 8 pm and as we were leaving we could hear the live band starting to play in the lounge. If I hadn't worked a long hard day we would have moved into the lounge for a cocktail and entertainment. Looks like a lot of locals enjoy Friday nights at the lounge.  

I will definitely return to Ve bene in the near future.  If you want delicious well prepared food, excellent service and great ambience then Ve Bene is the place."}
{"text":"Wed nite found the place mostly empty.  Drinks good and reasonable.  Food while good/great but pricey...could have thrown in a small salad.  Espresso creme bruGtlee was to die for!"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend for some martinis and appetizers. I was blown away by the calamari, whatever the sauce they put on top is... is pretty delicious. For happy hour you can expect to pay a little over $4 for just the calamari and they are very generous with portions. I love the crispy-ness and the calamari itself isn't chewy. 

I loved our bartender, she was so sweet and helpful. The hostess on the other hand was awkward and rude. I am pretty sure she has no idea what her job entitles. We walked in and she gave us a rude stare as if we were suppose to be the first to speak. Excuse me, but a \"Hi, welcome to Va Bene\" would have been a thoughtful gesture as it is your job. We just didn't bother, we just helped ourselves to the bar. 

Please Va Bene, inform your hostess to talk and let them know what their job duties are. They are not well informed or you just hire high school girls to stand around. We've had this experience here a few times. 
The owner of the place was pleasant, sweet, and friendly. The staff who brought out our food was also very kind, this was very pleasing. Great establishment, great bartender, great food (pure excellence), great vibe, and amazing martinis."}
{"text":"I was down visiting my Daughter and her fiance and we decided to try this place out.  At first, I thought I might be too under dressed. it has a dining area with table cloths and candles.  I was in just shorts and a polo shirt and was not looking for a fancy place.  but they have a great little bar area with tables that worked out just fine.  I ordered the stuffed pork, wife ordered the spaghetti.  My daughter ordered some shrimp pasta and I did not get to see what her fiance ordered, but it must have been great, he ate it all! My pork was great, I really enjoyed the dish.  cooked just right, mashed potatoes were perfect, vegetables were super.  Wifes dish was very good.  I'd recommend this place if you're in town. great service, great food.  it's on the list to return to sometime."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food great. I had a spinaci salad and the seafood bisque. Very nice ambience and also have to mention the drinks were great. I will go back and often."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner last Friday. It was very busy but had no problem seating us. We sat in the bar/lounge facility where Trevor was our bartender. What a superb job he did. Service was stupendous. Overall great food with a great staff. Easily 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Staked at this place for a friend's dinner party for 25 or so. I was surprised to see one server for the entire group but somehow with some hiccups he managed to get it done. The server would grab everyone's attention and let us all know that we need to be in our seats so he can take he order. Is this grade school class?!?! Kinda ironic but I guess it works because otherwise his orders would get mixed up when receiving the checks in the end. 

I read some of the horrific reviews from prior and major letdowns were the slowness in service but quickness in receiving drinks and salads and appetizers. While ordering if someone asked for a drink that previously didn't get one the server would halt the ordering procession and leave to go get the drink! Thought that was odd yet comical. And, surprisingly our food came out quick but it was only because it was almost 9pm after majority of the customers were done eating. 

Gnocchi alla vodka: one of the best dishes on the menu or at least of what we tried. House made potato gnocchi with tomato, cream and pink vodka. $13.95

Zuppa di Vongole:  clams steamed in white wine, olive oil, garlic sauce. The sauce base was rather tasty. We were definitely missing the crostini (toasted bread) but did soak up the garlic sauce with the starter bread. $9.95

Fettuccine con pollo and fungi: normal run of the mill type of pasta dish that can be made at home. Chicken chunks and fungi pieces and creamy high caloric white sauce share amongst three. $13.95. 

Getting our checks took years and not sure why. The server would start the same process as he did for taking food orders. So if you started last in food ordering you'd get your check last. Not sure what kind of system they have but definitely not efficient."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food at reasonable prices. Nice bar. Recommended. We also enjoy having appetizers at the bar and listening to the live music on the weekends."}
{"text":"Always solid food...highly recommended the gnocchi ala vodka I sub the gnocchi for penne! One of the best Italian spots in Arizona! Also the bread and cheese butter is to die for! Enjoy"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time probably 5 or 6 years ago.  Whenever I'm in town on business, I try to make it by.  I like to sit at the bar so I don't look like I got stood up by sitting alone at a table in the dining room.  On my most recent visit, the bartender didn't seem that into help me out.  I ordered a drink and an appetizer and ended up waiting for about 20 minutes for him to return with the appetizer.  When I'd finished my first drink and appetizer, I had to flag him down to get him to come back over.  I then ordered another drink and a second appetizer.  I got my drink but 20 minutes later I flagged him down and asked him about the appetizer and he said he hadn't put in the order.  Given how slow the service was, I decided to cut my losses and was on my way.  Probably just a sub-par employee but enough to keep me from making any special effort to get back there next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Lousy customer service. Hector the barback/busboy was the only one that cared about my service. 

They didnt bring out bread with the meal. The food was bland and overpriced

Even the hostess didnt care, wow.

Save your money, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! My husband and I both love this place for date night. The restaurant is very nice and great for a date night. Authentic, homemade  Italian food. Would absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"Again, my dish vegetarian style  was better than my carnivores companion. Most restaurants make you feel weird about not eating meat or substituting. So, when I asked for no chicken in my fettuccine con pollo y fungi, I thought I'd get a look of \"ugh\". But, our wonderful waitress said \"oh, absolutely. How about broccoli instead\" I answered gleefully; \"yes, please\"  It was flavorful and delicious."}
{"text":"By far the best restaurant in Ahwatukee. You folks from other parts of PHX should take the drive to try it out. Food is amazing. Service is great!  Wonderful happy hour."}
{"text":"Went dancing with some friends a couple of weeks ago and we had a great time at Va Bene's. The live band was amazing and playing mostly 80's music. Drinks were fairly priced and the appetizers we had were very good.  Enjoyed the crowd and we will definitely be going back. I just wish there was this type of restaurant on the west side of town where I live."}
{"text":"The food and ambiance were fantastic! I will definitely return. Bonus feature, the restaurant turns into a after hours club."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has such good reviews. The bread and butter was amazing but we never got asked if we wanted more. We actually only saw our server twice. To take the order and to give us our check (30 minutes after we were done eating and after we had to ask another server). My boyfriend ordered chicken and didn't like it (surprise it wasn't chicken) and it was a very very small portion. I got pasta that was tasteless (Olive Garden has better pasta and I refuse to eat Olive Garden). 

My boyfriend ordered chicken and ended up getting veal ($8 price difference and it was only around 3oz of veal and was terrible).

I will never be back!!! Service was terrible and the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. We had a pasta dish and a fish dish and they were both superb. The general manager Rick came over and talked to us very very nice person .The waiter Dani, was very attentive .We couldn't be happier and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites, it never disappoints. it has a dining room which is pretty fancy but you can also eat in the lounge where the bar is and lauren to live music or watch the game. The gnocchi is to die for and everything else has always been delicious! great service too and the band is always fun!"}
{"text":"I often go to Va Bene for happy hour, they have one of the best happy hours in town! First off, happy hour is until 7:00, which is a huge plus. AND, Happy Hour is EVERY DAY starting at 4, and ALL DAY on Sunday and Monday.

As far as drinks go, in addition to beer and wine, they have a huge variety of marvelous martini's featuring Grey Goose and Skyy specials. The Blueberry Lemon Drop Martini was our favorite. In the past, I have also enjoyed the Espresso Martini. 

The appetizers are amazing, and all but the scallops are half price. And even full price, the scallops are worth every penny; huge scallops, perfectly cooked and served with a heaping side salad of field greens and tomatoes, perfectly dressed with a light vinaigrette. I sometimes get this for my meal. 

The Bruschetta is good if you're not afraid of garlic and the Antipasto Misto is a great dish to share. The Calamari Fritti is tasty, which is also served with a small side salad. (Yes, I eat the garnish.  What? It's good!!) 

Other favorites include the Gamberoni con Prosciutto (proscuitto wrapped shrimp) and the Carpaccio, both big winners! The complimentary bread is soft and served with delicious roasted red pepper butter, very yummy! The staff is always sure to keep the breadbasket and water glasses full at all times. 

By the time we are finished, we are all pleasantly stuffed, slightly buzzed, and 100% happy!"}
{"text":"let me preface my star rating by saying i did not eat here - only a mid workday early hh break.
apparently it's the bee's knees for italian food. and it also happens to have quite a reputation for being a bit of cougar bar and the place for the 40+ single set to be seen and take home that recent divorcee and test drive his new maserati/her new boob job.

that being said, i had no desire to try this spot out. however, i was invited here for a HH drink.

when we first showed up, it was about 330, and they didn't technically open til 4, but the bartendar said it was no prob and his smile told me that was sincere. the bar takes up an entire room, a four-sided job and extra tables for more seating. an hour and a half later and this place was buzzing with the right-at-5 HH crowd and cougars were on the prowl indeed - along with business professionals you would expect in TukeTown. 

Not sure on the prices of the drinks because i was being treated, but i would imagine they were on the heftier side, given the ambiance and style of the joint. all in all it was a better experience than i was anticipating - the crowd was certainly not my style but i didn't really feel out of place. i'll have to go back for eats and see if it's as fabulous and everyone says!"}
{"text":"Bleh. Food was average to bleh. Service good. I am from the NY area and local Italian restaurants were plentiful and delicious. Hard to find one here."}
{"text":"Came in earlier today for dinner. I had saved up an appetite for this place. I was definitely feeling like eating something meaty and filling. I decided upon the Lamb Shanks. Although coming to an Italian restaurant one would expect to eat something Italian. However, when I  saw this menu item I was sold. The dish came with two 8 oz lamb shanks and creamy feta risotto. The lamb shanks were fall off the bone tender and the risotto was really tasty and had a great consistency. You definitely get your moneys worth on this dish. (Two lamb shanks for $25 !) The only thing missing in this dish would have been some lemon wedges to squeeze over the dish as this was a heavy siting entree and would have helped to cut through the richness. 

For dessert, I ordered the traditional creme brulee. the creme brulee had to be at least 8 oz of custardy goodness. it had a nice crust with even caramelization. the interior was still very chill and velvety. Definitely the one of the best creme brulees in the phx area. Also- one creme brulee is enough for two!"}
{"text":"Attempted to go on date night. 

Sat at the bar. Took over ten minutes for the blonde bartender to make her way past three other customers that were already well into their meals. Otherwise, not busy at all. Ordered two bottles of beer - I guess you have ASK for a chilled glass for said bottles of beer. Could not get the attention of the bartender at all. 

Told \"Rick\" the manager that she must be \"in the weeds\" since getting her attention was pointless. 

And this is supposed to be one of the more fine establishments in the Ahwatukee area to dine?

Being informed via social media that this establishment is a \"cougar hangout\" and \"swinger\" hook-up spot during later hours. 

No thanks."}
{"text":"Love Va Bene! Great food every time. Recommend sitting in the lounge and enjoying the live music, but you will probably have to get there early in order to get a table or a spot at the bar. We always get the Calamari. I like to order the sauce on the side because it gets a little to greasy/heavy with it on top. We've had several of the pasta options and never had a bad meal. My favorite is the Alfredo with mushrooms. So much yummy goodness and you'll have some leftovers to take home. The service is excellent and it has a romantic feel, but not stuffy. Excellent for a date night. Keep an eye out for Groupons they have them regularly!"}
{"text":"A true gem! 
This beautiful restaurant is tucked away in the corner of a strip mall, but when you walk in the door it's as though you are transported to Italy.
European-style service means there is always a server (or helper) at the ready, but they basically leave you alone to enjoy your selections. We did not want for anything, nor did we ever need to search for a waiter.
Varied affordable menu choices include authentic recipes and offerings. Extensive wine list means there is something for every taste (and budget)."}
{"text":"We came here thanks to a Groupon. I had the eggplant appetizer and the sauce made me swoon. The stuffed eggplant was good and cheesy. For my entree I had the gnocchi ala vodka. Again the sauce was delicious and the gnocchi was light and tender. My husband had the stuffed pork tenderloin. There was an herb used that I didn't care for but the pork was tender and my husband loved it. Staff was attentive and knowledgeable about the food. Classy decor."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, atmosphere is good. Bands, etc are good. Staff is not great. Hostesses are snotty and wait staff is just okay."}
{"text":"Summary: fantastic food, wonderful service, a little spendthrift, great place to take a date, if middle aged and single, great social scene for this crowd. 

These guys are the real deal. They have escargot which is not easy to find. I little off center serving a French dish in an Italian eatery. But it is good. I am a huge gnocchi fan and they deliver. Although the bar is in full swing, the dining room remains quite. I recommend date night followed by a drink with friends..just don't expect 22 year olds doing keg stands."}
{"text":"Food was excellent service was amazing and the live band kept everyone on their feet. We came to celebrate a birthday this was a perfect get together place for people of different age groups. This is definetly a go to place in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Why only a \"fair rating\"?  I have been to Va Bene on MANY occasions.  We decided to go for at Va Bene disappointing.  To start with, I made my New Year's Eve reservation on/or about December 1.  THAT was probably a mistake... it was too soon.  When we arrived, I was learned that they had a \"Special Limited Menu\".  I was NOT informed of that when I made my reservation.  When I called, I specifically asked and was told the menu was normal!  When I questioned the \"special limited menu\", I was told that everyone was told when they made their reservation.... NOT TRUE.  I was told that everyone was called a few days before New Year's Eve to confirm their reservation.... NOT TRUE.  I was told that when confirming the reservation, everyone was told there was a \"special limited menu\".... OBVIOUSLY NOT TRUE, because EVERYONE at all the tables around me said they were NOT CALLED.  Besides, if everyone was told there was a \"special limited menu\" when your reservation was made, WHY would you have to let everyone know when you called to confirm?  OBVIOUSLY MANAGEMENT WAS LYING!!!!!  Despite their not being truthful, the choices were \"adequate\" (about 5 entrees) and she service was excellent.  HOWEVER, we ordered the Stuffed Sea Bass and it was warm at best.  I was going to send it back, but by that time, I was already annoyed enough by the way everything was going, so I just could not be bothered.  A few other couples who did not know about the \"special limited menu\" had a difficult time with the menu.  One woman was lactose intolerant and she was unable to select many of the choices including the appetizers and desserts.  They did make a special but unimpressive special desert for her (because desert was supposed to be included with the \"special menu\").  Another couple had to leave because the woman was allergic to shell fish and most of the entrees included shell fish or shell fish ingredients.  Bottom line, this was the first and only time I was disappointed with Va Bene.  I highly recommend Va Bene, however, I would be very careful on a holiday and most certainly New Year's Eve.  I STRONGLY SUSPECT, when I made my reservation on/or about December 1, they had no idea they were going to have a \"special limited menu\" for New Year's Eve and THAT is why it was such a surprise to both myself and the other guests.  Lastly, our waiter was very good, and was obviously having difficulty with the restaurant's last minute decision to have a \"special limited menu\".  He did a very good job and made a great effort to take care of the customer's request."}
{"text":"Google translates the Italian phrase \"va bene\" into the English term, \"all right.\"  This restaurant is more than just \"all right.\"

Everything here is spectacular!  I've been quite a few times this past year and I have not had anything I didn't enjoy. (And I'm not a fan of Italian, so that's saying something!) 

I was able to indulge myself and a friend at happy hour where appetizers are half off.  There were also a selection of drinks that were included, but I only allowed myself one $2 off wine. 

Some of my favorites on the dinner menu includes Fettuccine Curry. (Yes, Curry! Try it, you'll be glad you did!) The Linguine Vongole is another favorite at our table.  We've also enjoyed the Fettuccine Con Pollo & Fungi. 

Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place has always been magical to us.  Tonight was a big disappointment.  They have made a huge downgrade in ambiance and customer service.  Could have been easily remedied but the general manager just continued to make things worse."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service (Srdjan) was atrocious. After he brought the food, he ignored us for 40 minutes. No water refills, no plate clearing, no box, no check until we were finally able to flag him down. I won't go back; too bad, because the calamari was the best I've had!"}
{"text":"I'm from Philly and am a self appointed gnocchi connoisseur.  My I laws and I are on a life long quest to find the best gnocchi in the country.  Said In laws were in Gilbert last month and ate here.  The lauded the gnocchi as the best ever.  So this trip we had to try them.  They are close if not the best I've eaten. The vodka sauce is spectacular! The gnocchi are like little clouds of deliciousness...well most of them.  The only glitch, and it is tiny but we are talking the best gnocchi in the country here, so if we find a nit we must pick it. They needed to be stirred and cooked for a few more seconds as some were not fully cooked.  The under cooked were a little bit \"doughy\".  All in all the are great, go there and eat them!"}
{"text":"Server seemed bored and reeked of cigarettes. Food was pretty good but we sat outside for an after dinner drink for 30 minutes while servers ignored us. Got our own drinks at the bar before going somewhere else."}
{"text":"The wait staff and food are great!  The small jazz bands and dancing are a blast!!
Can get a bit crowded at dinner but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Food was Very Good, not Excellent but Very Good.  Portions were good size.  Service was also good.  Ate in the lounge area.  I used a Groupon, and was very unhappy with the terms Va Bene imposed.

1.  Happy Hour Specials did not apply - I accepted that, but was surprised!

2.  They automatically added the tip @ 20% of the total before applying the Groupon.  Now I tend to be a generous tipper, and will gladly pay for Good Service.  But, I DO NOT like being told what to tip, without being informed of this before hand.  

I have used Groupon's before, and this was the first time I was confronted with this tipping procedure."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there for a girls' classy dinner night:) and were pleasantly surprised. It's hard to find a decent Italian place in Chandler. We didn't go to the lounge area so I can't say anything about that, we went straight to the dining area. The atmosphere was really pleasant and there were quite a few people on a Wednesday night which is always a good sign I think. 

First, compliments and then critique.

The appetizer was good, we got shrimp in wrapped in bacon (as far as I remember) and it was yummy. The stuffed pork with cranberry wine sauce was delicious! Absolutely loved it. The portion was quite large too, I got stuffed. No pun intended. We also swapped the standard sides for their zucchini risotto which I thought was all right, not great, but my friend thought it was absolutely delicious. 

Now the critique. This restaurant is not super expensive but it's not cheap. So you'd think that after you're done with your appetizer they would take your appetizer plate away. They didn't. It sat on the table with some shrimp tales pretty much through the entire dinner. And for $8 we only got 4 shrimp for the appetizer. I get it, that's what fancy restaurants do but could you bump it up to 6 maybe? Still not a lot, but they won't look so lonely on the plate.  

Other than that, we had a really nice night out and will come back. It's hard to find a nice Italian restaurant that's not Olive Garden or (yuk) Rigatoni's quality so it was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"My family and I just enjoyed the most amazing lunch here. Va Bene is one of those special places hidden in a non-descript stripmall. The atmosphere is relaxing, the food is outstanding and the prices are very reasonable.  What took this visit to the next level was the 5-star service we received from Todd.  He was truly exceptional in every way, and took very good care of us. I'd even go as far as requesting to be seated in his section next time (and there WILL be a next time!)"}
{"text":"You cannot beat the food at this place.  You will not find better Italian food anywhere in Ahwatukee and the happy hour is awesome.   The atmosphere is great and the potato gnocchi is the best I have ever had.  This place is 5 stars all day."}
{"text":"Great place for food and live music. The band was okay, but the atmosphere was really lively and fun!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Va Bene for about five years now and still love it. 
It is one of the few classy places to go dancing to live music on Friday and Saturday nights. 
The manager and staff understand customer service perfectly. 
The seasoned butter and bread they bring to your table is fresh and savory. The pastas are always delicious. We have never a special that we didn't like- but the ravioli special is always our favorite. 
I must say they have the BEST escargot I have ever had. It is in a delightful pastry and goes so well with a red Tuscan wine. 
If you have any questions about wine, all of the servers are excellent at recommendations. 
The only complaint is that the smokers need to move away from the door. 
First rate!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Delicious food especially the tiramisu made in house.   Looking forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"Although there calamari wasn't too good. Their food was Super amazing their bread and butter was the best. Defiantly coming here again. ."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. The prices here are pretty reasonable.  The food was very good, I had chicken Marsala and spouse had pasta, then we split a spinach salad.  I did not like that they charged us 2 to put the salad on 2 separate plates.  Next time we would just share.  Overall, food was very good, will be back here."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????Worst service ever!"}
{"text":"I went to dinner here Sunday night. I left  a review about how poor the food was on the Groupon review.

Hi gina,
Response to Your Groupon Comment
Va Bene Restaurant has sent you this message in response to your feedback:
Va Bene Restaurant Dear Groupon customer. I have no comment for you except that you have no clue about food. So continue to eat the dog food that you are accustomed to eat. Because you don't have any clue what homemade food tastes like.@\"

This is what they said back to me . WOW will never go back here."}
{"text":"Just left. Everything was good. Ordered linguine frutti di mare, excellent, I'm glad I shared with my daughter, big portion. My husband ordered linguine Vongole which he loved. Good choice of wines. Waiter seemed to have forgotten us but we would come again if in the area"}
{"text":"I would give the food 4 stars. It's the service that stunk (one star would be appropriate).  Our server Sergio, was terrible.  He seemed to have the snotty waiter \"I'm too good to be serving you\" attitude.  He was barely at our table, when he was interacting with us he was short and rude.  I would try Va Bene again, but would request NOT to be seated in Sergio's section!  Hopefully, the rest of the wait staff is kinder."}
{"text":"I guess this will the last time eating here for us.  I was pretty upset last night.  When we got there for dinner, we were told that due to the \"holiday\" they were not accepting Groupon vouchers.  What holiday?  Mother's Day is not a holiday!  And when I made the reservation, there was no mention of \"no Groupon's\".  Their website also said nothing about \"no Groupon's for this \"holiday\"\"!  Since we were already there and my wife wanted to eat something here she likes, we decided to stay anyway.  

We got a grumpy and surly waiter who did not make my attitude any better.  We ordered drinks and those were fine and came quickly.  They took some things off the menu that we liked, so we ordered 4 large appetizers -- the bruschetta was fine (and this is what my wife wanted), and so was the antipasto platter.  But the both the calamari and the steamed mussels in tomato broth came to the table cold.  This added to my disappointment.  

So I don't think I will be visiting this establishment again."}
{"text":"We went to Va Bene with a coupon from Living Social. I figured that we would have no trouble spending $60 on dinner for 2 on a Sunday evening. I was surprised to see that it was harder than I thought. 

It was very slow on Sunday night around 7, and we were not greeted at the front door so we wandered into the bar. We were told we could seat ourselves in the bar, or have the hostess seat us in the restaurant. The bar was fine. The bartender took our drink orders and although my husband was disappointed that there are no beers on tap, he managed to find something he would enjoy - a Stella. No bad marks here, as not every bar needs to have beer on tap. 

We skipped the appetizers, but they look worth checking out in the future. Especially since happy hour offers them at half price. 

I had the chicken marsala - which is my favorite dish and it did not disappoint. There were 2 large half chicken breasts and a nice brown sauce loaded with mushrooms. It came with mashed potatoes and veggies, so the plate was generous. My husband had chicken in an artichoke cream sauce, and it was very good as well. 

I only have one minor complaint:  My husband's plate was cleared before I was done eating. When there are only 2 diners at the table and I am the only one with a plate in front of me I feel rushed. I am sure that was not intended, and is probably just my pet peeve, and not a reason not to return to a place that had really good food in a beautiful setting. 

When the server learned we had $60 to spend he said we should order something else as our bill was only $43. So we had both regular and chocolate cheesecakes and coffee (even after a 2nd beer, we were still under $60!). Some of the desserts are made in  house, and I should have gone with one of those. The cheesecake was fine, but did not stand out. 

I certainly recommend Va Bene for a nice dinner that won't break the bank. Also, even though I checked the box that says it's an upscale restaurant, we were not the only ones seated at linen covered tables in shorts. Hey, it's still Phoenix."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The food was good. I was very disappointed that they didn't offer fresh brewed iced tea. For a restaurant at this level they really should be brewing their own ice tea instead of using the fountain pop."}
{"text":"Excellent food, prices, service, atmosphere and happy hour!! Hard to beat this place, really!"}
{"text":"Came here with 3 others and had a great time. We had drinks from the happy hour special menu and were more than happy. We ordered escargot, clams, and bruschetta for appetizers; all were good not great....bruschetta was a bit burnt/toasty. Dinner wise I had veal Marsala and my friends had chicken Marsala, chicken Parmesan, and gnocchi, all were good not great and all were a bit on the salty side. Over all experience was great, our server Samantha was exceptional, and the meals were ok."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my first dinner at Va Bene ( the spaghetti with marinara) and promise to return for the gnocchi. Everything was spot on. the service was above and beyond.  Will try and leave room for dessert next time.  Fyi-- I believe happy hour deals are only available in the lounge/bar area, as it is at many fine establishments. Go and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Great evening out on a Tuesday night.  The food and drinks were on point and Dylan provided exceptional service.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Michelle at the bar is a freakin' Savant!  I swear.  I think the last time I was here was about a year ago and she served me a meal that unfortunately had to be returned. I don't remember why because every meal I have had here has been excellent!  Seriously. 

Anyway, she was so gracious about the problem I think she charged me 1/2 off the newly served dish (or something like that).  

Well... I walked in today (again a year or more later) and she greeted me with a Big smile and said, \"Andrew is it?\". I mean, holy schnikees Batman!  How the heck?!?!

So, come to the bar and introduce yourself to Michelle.  Never mind the smile and the great service... she obviously won't forget your name. 

Thank you Michelle!  You are appreciated."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed Va Bene for many years. The food and service has always been excellent. We were not happy with the new calamari appetiser, one if our favourites over the years. It used to have a wonderful tarter sauce with side greens. Now, boring mayo sauce and no greens. Never will order again! Still great place for music and drinks!"}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite Italian restaurant, hands down.  Service, ambience, quality of food and drinks are all unparalleled.  Has been a family favorite for over a decade!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for my wife's birthday dinner tonight. The atmosphere is very nice,  but a little dark inside the dinning area.  The service was okay.  The food was nothing special. I was not impressed with the chicken piccata, which is my test for most Italian restaurants. It's a simple dish, and if they make that well, then usually the rest of their food is decent.  Their Piccata was very salty, and didn't have much of a lemon tang as it should. The dinner didn't come with a salad, or a vegetable even. I left the restaurant hungry, which for a $16 dollar meal shouldn't happen. My wife just had soup and a salad, because she was saving room for their expresso creme brulee. She liked what she had, but said she wouldn't order any of them again. That says enough for me that we'll likely not be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Sat immediately. Water glass always full. Server gave great recommendations. Grouper special was delicious and they are flexible with the menu. The restaurant is very clean and prices are reasonable. I would come back here for sure. Definitely a new favorite."}
{"text":"I had to redeem my groupon, so I took my parents, brother, and sister who have never been there.  Okay, so it was a monday and the staff was not on their toes.  The service was non-existant, but they recovered well towards the end with apologies..  My family ALWAYS eats desert, but that was not offered.   The server never asked if we wanted appetizers, my dad wanted calamari, never asked for drinks, salads, etc.  Simply are we ready to order.  My family was unaware that options for salad or soup did not come with the entree.  There was only one other table in the restaurant, a couple.  I did see the gentleman get up and go to the kitchen entrance, so I would gather their experience was not any better than mine.

I typically always go to the lounge for happy hour and food, which is always fabulous.  This is the first time for the dining room experience.  Disappointing service experience when I was trying to impress my family with an Ahwautukee location.  My parents dine out 300 of the 365 days of the year, and travel extensively.

But, I must say the SALMON and the Stuffed PORK was truly AMAZING."}
{"text":"Va Bene.. ahhh.. well I used to live close to here.. so if we wanted to go have wines, apps or a late dinner.. AND watch the 40+ crowd get their groove on.. this is where we would go.. bc I could walk and have some entertainment... Hey man.. sometimes it doesnt take much! 
I do like the bar...its nice with alot of good wines on the list... The bartenders have always been super sweet.. 
NOT loving much on the menu.. but I travel alot and will say my fav Italian is in the east coast.. (if not Italy itself:-) ) .. 
But to counter the effects of a bit of wine.. Id recommend the bruschetta... patio..? Well it faces a parking lot.. but again.. some good stuff to watch going down out there.. like I said, cheap entertainment.. Ive more of a choice now that Ive moved:-)"}
{"text":"This place has great food and a nice atmosphere as long as you go early or when the music hasn't started. Once the music starts, this place turns in to a totally different atmosphere/ They bring in great bands who offer great music to dance the night away to, the best bands in town really! I'd say the service is inconsistent. They are either really great or really bad. Last night we had a wonderful server, once we finally got him to come over to our table. The weekend before was mediocre at best. And a few weeks ago we had a server that pretty much ignored us all night, forgot to place our food order, never asked if we needed refills, and was more concerned with whatever was on the TV than serving us. Then we got double charged at the end of the night. Very disappointing. Some nights I go in wanting to eat, but can't place a food order because the kitchen was already closed, when it's suppose to be open til 11pm. It seems that when the owner leaves then everything shifts gears.

The ladies room is unkept at night. They always run out of toilet paper, the toilets often become backed up, they run out of paper towels to dry your hands, and the floors are gross!

It's no secret that the \"cougars\" call this place home, you'll see the occasional \"swinger\" couple, and the regulars with their weird dancing quarks. Whatever, it makes for good people watching. But what I have a problem with is having to witness couples engaging in sexual behavior in the booths and at the bar without anyone on staff saying or doing anything about it. The staff just stood in the corner watching it all go down. This is disgusting, makes your customers uncomfortable, and a health violation if you ask me. They should have been asked to leave. Instead, I had several friends leave because no one was doing anything about it. Bad for business! My other issue of concern is people being over served. I've seen this happen on several occasions. Last night a clearly drunk gal punched her date in the face. And while he left, she stayed and was able to keep drinking. I just hope she wasn't driving. Oh, and did I mention the women smoking pot in the ladies room last night? Oh, yea, that happened too. Really people?!?! Leave it at home!

I write this review because I am in here very often and have been coming for many years and want to see some changes being made, especially before the second location opens. I love this place and want to see your continued success, but please make some changes."}
{"text":"This place is horible for dates what hell are u people thinking its a tacky meat market for devorces and creepers. Take this place off ur list trust me"}
{"text":"Excellent find!! Wonderful food and service! Highly recommend for genuine Italian food. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Terrible service from the unfriendly hostess to the bored waiter that couldn't be bothered to write down our order (and of course got it mixed up).  The food was good though and had some interesting specials."}
{"text":"Love this hot spot! Great service, delicious food and tons of fun!!! Live band , dancing and super place to meet new people!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, reasonably priced, excellent service. We love this place!! The atmosphere is beautiful. True Italian food!"}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks, nice patio, friendly waitstaff. I always visit Va Bene when I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wow, my wife and i decided to go out spur of the moment with our kid. We bought a groupon and went on our merry way. All of our meals tasted like a tub of salt fell into them, we couldn't eat more than a few bites before we gave up and got the check. Our stomachs are still burning in pain and we feel sick. We took some time to order our meals and we could tell the waiter was becoming impatient. It's possible this was intentional but who knows. Never go here."}
{"text":"Food was great and reasonably priced with restaurant.com coupon. I would've gave five stars if the waiter wasn't so cocky and direct."}
{"text":"I have a special place in my heart for this restaurant, as it was the site of my boyfriend and mine's 2nd date :)

However, their food is SOOOOO good.  And I don't think its because I'm biased.

I always end up getting their gnocchi with vodka sauce, because it is just that good."}
{"text":"I guess this part of town is becoming little Italy as this is just one of 6 or so Italian options in the area.

This is a locally owned non chain. As of late their bar at happy hour seems to be the place to be.

I have gone here for both lunch and dates. For lunch the place is strangely empty and it can be a bit awkward, but decent.

For dates it is great, the dining room has a classy quiet atmosphere. The bread with the sun dried tomato butter is great. 

If you hear about a special that sounds good ask the price as I was surprised by my $32 mahi mahi special on one trip. It was good however.

I typically opt for the ganocci al la vodka sans chicken. The al la vodka sauce is bright and has a luxurious mouth feel. The Gnocci have a great texture, with a nice chewy firmness that one expects in them.

The parking lot can get a bit crowed, so you may need to park closer to  Kohles."}
{"text":"Sitting in the restaurant now ordered our appetizers, salad and dinner 50 min. ago, apps and salad came out right away and where great. Have not seen waiter (Boris) since ordering, no check back at all. Still have not received entree. The food here is great but the service is terrible."}
{"text":"I had been to the bar at this trendy little spot several times with co-workers and friends, but I hadn't tried their dining room until recently.

The waiter was very knowledgeable and recommended some great entrees for us to try. With the caprese salad as an appetizer, our meals were more than enough!

I regret never having eaten in their dining room before and will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"The first time I went, I loved it. Food was good, service was alright, atmosphere was cool. With that being said, I still give it a two stars from one bad impression that I got coming here again. I brought in business, maybe 20 or so people, expecting the same treatment I got beforehand. However, I was completely wrong. Our server was HORRIBLE. He never checked on us, was rude, and the food came extremely late. We were there for hours just waiting on him. I remember we asked him for bread which is normally brought out for an appetizer and he literally told us, \"We didn't need bread.\" Uhhh, excuse me? I told him literally 3 times to bring the bread and after several attempts and getting tired of waiting, the bread finally came out. Everyone at my table was restless. I complained for the horrible service I received and there was no redemption. The manager did nothing and looked at me as if it had been a joke. This experience totally ruined my birthday and I was extremely embarrassed to have brought my party."}
{"text":"The hubski and I visited Va Bene after reading some glowing reviews.
I love this place because its a haven for cougars as well as $10,000 millionaires. Lets face it, sometimes its fun to be a $10,000 millionaire.
We have been back many times, and every time are greeted by Sasha, the manager, and by our favorite waiters. Maybe this is because of the impression ( and 10 business cards) the hubski leaves everywhere he goes, or maybe everyone gets this treatment, but Va Bene is kind of like our Cheers now.
The place has great decor and magnificent food, but you can eat for as little as $11 or as much as $35 per plate. The tiramisu is out of this world, as is the tartufo. What, you may ask, is a tartufo? Picture this and be prepared to salivate (maybe have a tissue on hand). A tartufo is a scoop of sorbet, chocolate or raspberry, dipped in chocolate (dark, I think), re-frozen, sliced on a bed of fresh whipped cream, and drizzled with chocolate or raspberry syrup. Unbelievable.
I have ordered something different every time I go, and I never cease to be delighted. The first time was the most special though- the fish of the day. It was halibut on top of sauteed spinach and feta mashed potatoes. That's right. Feta. Indulgent.
Nice bar, great wine list. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Love this place.  1st time there last night.  Bar is so cozy.   Excellent food,  martinis and wine.  Service was amazing.  Sam best waitress.  The general manager checked on us several times.  You rarely see that these days.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST!  Great decor, great outside dining, true Italian feel to the place.  And then there is the FOOD!  WOW.  Visiting from Seattle and have eaten there twice and hope to go once more.  We have had the antipasto misto, Melanzane Ripieni, calamari, clams, mussels, spinach salad.  The clams in wine sauce were perfect!  The mussels were smaller than ours in the Northwest so I enjoyed them much more, they were in a sauce that is indescribable!  Your mouth falls in love!  The champagne vinaigrette on the spinach salad was obviously homemade and could never be duplicated, sad. And the calamari was excellent with a garlic mayonnaise.

The second time we were there we sat outside during happy hour and the place was completely packed and the wonderful staff managed to take care of all of us timely and friendly.

The happy hour is the type I like, half off of any appetizers, rather than offering a few shabby dishes at a discount.  

AMORE!!"}
{"text":"If you want Real Italian   This is it. Great waiters. Great Italian Bread. Hugh wine selection. But the Best is the food. Great flavorful Italian dishes. Good portions. At fair reasonable price. 5 star"}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow, what a find.  There are so many Italian restaurants in the valley, I have to admit, I probably wouldn't have found Va Bene if it weren't for a causal search on Groupon one day.  I thought...sure I'll buy it, what's the harm in trying.  I live in the west valley so not exactly close by...but we happened to be passing through last night so we stopped to try it out.
We were early...around 5 or so.  The place was pretty empty and we were seated in the nice and quiet back room.  Our server (who I failed to remember his name but he was a friendly gentleman from Yugoslavia) was EXTREMELY nice and helpful.  He asked if we'd been before and we said no, so he was awesome in explaining dishes.  We had our children with us and they don't have a children's menu but they were more than willing to make something kid-friendly for them (although honestly my kids love everything and will eat most anything).  Our table ordered and highly enjoyed:
Pasta Siciliana
Pasta Bolognese
Shrimp with Curry Sauce-a unique twist that my husband enjoyed per our server's recommendation 
Alfredo (for the kiddies) 
Gnocchi alla Vodka-this was my dish and it was OUTSTANDING-probably some of the best gnocchi I've ever had.  I would drive across the valley again just for this dish.
I now know where to come when I am craving gnocchi...done right.
The bread and tomato-Basil butter is delicious, warm and fresh.  The starter salads were also very good, nice size portion.
We were stuffed but I had to try their 'one of a kind' espresso Creme Brûlée.  It is very unique-sweet.  I highly recommend it.
Service was fantastic....up until the end.  Took a little while to clear plates and bring the check but I won't fault them because by then it was 6:30 and they were getting busy.
This is a family owned spot and we had a wonderful meal.  I am already drooling when I think about eating that gnocchi again!!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food & fabulous complimentary tiramisu for your birthday. We had 5 different dishes Salmone Va Bene ,lemon chicken, pasta w/ chicken, pasta w/ seafood, pasta w/ veggies, and everyone was happy. 

A nice quiet patio if you want to avoid the loud bar, but don't want the formal dining area.

My stand-by favorite Italian restaurant for years!"}
{"text":"Looking at the menu, I was excited to try a non-chain Italian restaurant.
The atmosphere is elegant and quiet, and the wait staff attentive.  The restaurant is billed as a wine bar, but not one Malbec to be found.
We enjoyed our shrimp appetizer, and the Spinach salad was interesting and well dressed. Big disappointment with both entrees. The veal Marsala was pounded so thin, that it resembled jerky breaded when it made it to the table. For $25 dollars, Olive Garden does a better job.  The stuffed pork loin suffered from being dried out and virtually tasteless.  The cardinal sin on both entrees was frozen, bland vegetables straight out of the steamer.  The $95 bill was just a waste of money.  Chef needs to get out of the 1980's and come up with better selections and plate presentation."}
{"text":"Gnocchi was excellent and best spinach salad ever. Excellent meal. Only recommendation is to keep the red wine at appropriate temperature. We had a bottle of amarone and it was  warm."}
{"text":"All of the food ordered at my table was very tasty.  Overall, a very reliable hardy Italian food place."}
{"text":"came in on a Monday night for a date and sat in the \"lounge\" bar. It's open seating so we sat in a booth.

It's was pretty dead that night which was good in the since we could have our private time without loud crowds.

Service was good and our server took care of us.

We had the escargot as an app, with lamb shanks and veal for our entree. The food seemed average to me. It was good, but nothing that would blow me away. I'm be willing to come back to see what else they offer."}
{"text":"I love Italian food and no matter where I go I keep coming back to my favorite one. Va Bene is not only good but they also have a great selection of vinos.  Their arrabbiata sauce is to \"die for\". Try it with sausage over your favorite pasta. Don't forget the chianti."}
{"text":"The chicken and mushroom pasta and the espresso Creme brûlée  is TO DIE FOR! The service is fantastic and the prices are great! Was just there last week and have already planned our next date night w the wife for this weekend again!"}
{"text":"One of the best places you will find in Arizona for great authentic Italian dishes.  Sunday and Monday they have happy hour 1/2 off appetizers all day long.  We've eaten there many times with family and friends and have yet to hear a single complaint."}
{"text":"I came here for shrimp rigatoni and got some brushetta as well. Shrimp Rigatoni was good but didn't fill me up but luckily the Brushetta did. Price was about $20 for both and staff was friendly. Overall not a bad spot but bigger portions would be better . Food quality is good and they do have a bar."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the waitstaff was friendly each time we've visited.  Actual Italians?  They seemed in the way like restauranteurs we experienced in Italy.  We loved their snails appetizer and our meals were well prepared."}
{"text":"Dazzling example of near-authentic Italian. \"Near-authentic\" because the only thing that keeps it from being authentic is a 12 hour flight to Firenze. Slide on over to LivingSocial, get a coupon, and run to Va Bene."}
{"text":"From the outside Va Bene looks like an every day Italian Restaurant. But once you go in it is fancy smancy! 

I have been to Va Bene a few times for different occasions and I continue to return for the Calamari alone! The absolute best Calamari I have found, and trust me I try the Calamari every where! 

Their food is good, I have also ordered the Fruiti Del Mar, which was a really great dish. My friend a year later still talks about the best steak he has ever had. 

I think Va Bene knows what they are doing and should continue to make its customers happy if they stick to their recipe for a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Va Bene's veal Marsala was the Best I've had since moving to Arizona. The service was excellent. My wife was not happy with her pork dish because it was different from the description in the menu; the management did NOT charge us for her meal. I highly recommend you try Va Bene."}
{"text":"So, I left a review for this place December of 2016.  

I am back to send myself (and any readers) a reminder why I love this hidden 24-year old Italian restaurant and bar.  Great each time.

I went on Tuesday January 9th with 3 buddies.  Good Call guys.

I have a hard time ordering since everything is delicious, and I want to everything on the menu.  Everyone ordered but me.  My friends have their go-to dishes already.  Sensing my frustration, the bartender Brett suggested I enjoy my known favorite: Chicken Piccata.  Served on small bed of craft mashed potatoes, I said maybe next time.  But the Picatta sauce:   butter, lemon juice, capers, with white wine was still calling my name.

The owner/manager Sasha was professionally eavesdropping and suggested I substitute salmon instead of chicken and place on bed of linguini instead of mashed potato. Hello. Wow, not on the menu, this was a home run! This should be on the menu all the time.  The salmon was flaky, perfect temp, and the linguini was the perfect texture.  

Only 1 problem ...there was sauce left-over in dish so I asked for a little more of their in-house fresh bread to soak up the butter, lemon, capers, white wine delight!  Problem is the bread is so good, you need to avoid eating it before, and in my case, after your meal.  It is that good.

Va Bene is truly va bene!

PS:  White Sauce or Red Sauce Mussels appetizer is an amazing happy hour item.  PSS:  Don't fill up on bread, though you can't help yourself."}
{"text":"The food was not very good. My pasta sauce tasted like it was from a can and the salmon was fishy tasting.  I only ate a very small amount.  My husbands dish of stuffed pork also was nothing to write home about. 
The salad and app and good--but that was it.  Also the band plays in the bar where we ate and the sound system is terrible.  You can't hear the music very good and certainly can't understand a word they say.  Overall this place wasn't very good and I would not waste my money to go back."}
{"text":"Took my wife out for her birthday.  She is a great lover of Calamari and orders it anywhere it might be available.  Unfortunately it was only average,  with a sparse dipping sauce sprinkled over it.  We've had better in many places.  I ordered a chicken piccata, she a stuffed pork loin which could have used more sauce.  Both the chicken and the pork were tough, but flavorful, with fresh veggies.  Service was average but slow.  The house wine was good and relatively inexpensive.  The best part of the evening was the discount through Groupon!  Our Creme Broule wasn't as good as we had hoped for.  I can only rate our total experience as 3 star."}
{"text":"Best ever of its kind the ambiance was nice the bisque was amazing as expected snd the mussels were Devine I love the house sauce they use i tasted it in both dishes"}
{"text":"The greatest restaurant we've eaten at for our entire trip in Arizona. Very reasonably priced, outstanding service, and so happy with the experience! Our table also ordered the House Merlot which was one of our favorites ever tasted, and also completely reasonable. If you are looking for an amazing dining experience, this restaurant is a must! I cannot speak more highly of it!"}
{"text":"This looks like a great place for a quiet date night meal.  We were there for a family meal, so the ambiance was somewhat wasted on us.  In any case, I had the seafood pizza and enjoyed it quite a bit.  It is nice to find something a little out of the ordinary on the menu.  I would like to try this place again."}
{"text":"As good as it gets in my opinion. This place is elegantly decorated with crimson red drapes and beautifully framed Picasso inspired paintings. Service was very immediate, attentive and professional throughout our entire meal.

I had a halibut special which was perfectly prepared in a light garlic butter sauce accompanied by very tasty mashed potatoes and freshly sautéed spinach.  My wife never passes up gnocchi made from scratch and Va Bene's did not disappoint her. Prepared in a light vodka sauce, the pasta dumplings were tender and light. 

The portions are generous and after a full size salad, I was unable to finish my entree but I did find room for their chocolate espresso creme brûlée which was absolutely killer great 

Va Bene was a terrific Yelp find that lived up to its many excellent reviews."}
{"text":"We came out here on the weekend to celebrate a birthday.  We did have 3 Groupons within the 6 if us and knew we were pushing it when asked to sit together as this was specified in the Groupon.  
The service was very pleasant and prompt.  We ordered the bruschetta and they also provided complimentary bread with a, sun dried tomato dip which was very nice. 
We ordered 2 of the gamberi pasta, 2 pork breaded cutlets, 1 veal masala and 1 chicken with asparagas.

All meals were nice but I can't say out of this world pretty simple family style serving with mash and vegetables with the meat.  

Will be back again with groupons:)"}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want a first-class dining experience from start to finish. Phoenix seems to have a dearth of quality Italian restaurants. This is the only one in the Valley I can think of that gets 5 stars. 

Service: outstanding. Our waiter was a consummate professional, i.e., not just a \"friendly guy\" but a gentleman who goes out of his way to make sure you know this is a top-notch restaurant. Without being snobby, of course. 

Atmosphere: up-scale Italian-American. 

Food: outstanding. The \"Zuppa di Funghi\", a mushroom soup, was out of this world. In perusing their website just now I'm surprised by the lower price of the main entrees, relative to their quality. It's still a bit pricey so I don't come here often. But it's perfect for special occasions and to satisfy an Italian craving."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks last evening to celebrate a friend's graduation.  The Antipasto Misto, Gamberoni con Prosciutto (fresh shrimp wrapped with basil and prosciutto), Melanzane Ripieni  (eggplant) were amazing.  Great Happy Hour pricing!  They have a great selection of wines (I enjoyed the J Lore Cabernet).  Great food and drink topped off by wonderful service.  One of the best restaurants in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"We have gone to Va bene for work lunch and it has always been ok. Decided this time to go for dinner so I took my Girlfriend.

Right away, the service was great. We were seated fast and brought menus. We were told about the specials of the day and we ordered appetizers quickly.

I order the Linguine Fruitti Del mar, and my girlfriend had the pesto linguine. We ordered the clams as an appetizer.

The clams came out and were great. The garlic broth smothering the clams were super tasty and the bread was crispy and great for dunking. The portion is really small, I counted 6 clams and 2 of them were empty. I swished my fork in the broth to see if they fell out, but they were never there.

The main course was pretty bad. The pesto had virtually no Basil taste and if you closed your eyes, you would not have guesses any basil was used. We tried it with our eyes closed and it tasted almost fettuccine -like. My Del Mar was super bland as well. It tasted like canned tomato paste. The Mussels were tough and chewy and not enjoyable. The calamari looked like noodles and had no taste. They were mushy and seemed to be over soaked or over-boiled. The crushed Red Pepper helped to spice up the dish, but didn't really help mask the overall blandness.

I gave this 3 stars cause the service was prompt and the owner (I think) came out a few times to check up on us. The bill was appropriate for a two person dinner (roughly $50). The food was the only disappointment. I will give this place another try and hope that our next visit is more tasty."}
{"text":"I love this place. Not a chain so they can go above and beyond for you. They have an awesome patio that has a fire pit and comfortable seating. The food is great as well. Try the mussels and the gnocchi. If you sit at the bar you will most likely get Michelle on a Monday or Tuesday. She is super welcoming and as I said before, goes above and beyond to make you the drink you want. And the bar is HUGE!!! I suggest anyone that like good Italian food try it!!"}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere, Good Food, Not The Most Attentive Service...

So to start things out with the most positive... This is an nice little spot hidden just off the main roads but quite possibly overlooked. 

The atmosphere is clean and inviting with a nice dimly lit environment that prepares you for a relaxing meal. 

We found this place in Groupon where there was a $40 gift certificate for only $20 which makes trying a place out motivational!

We arrived and were promptly seated in the back room in the corner. I came to the conclusion that the staff doesn't notice you often in the corner....

Water is refilled at half cup by the roaming water fillers... 

The food was a solid enjoyable 4 of 5 stars... it was tasty and good, but not an explosion of greatness... definitely worth the price and the visit. 

Ordering desert requires more than 10 minutes of watching the waiter visit each table but ours as I waved and attempted to gain his attention.... finally he came ask we asked for the dessert menu but here is no actual menu so he verbally gave it to us... We ordered two desserts and coffee to end the night.

Getting coffee wasn't easy... the desserts came out and still no coffee. After a bit the waiter said he was making some coffee for us and then it arrived. Then we had to wait for real sugar since they brought a tray of chemical sugar substitutes that we wouldn't use...

Finally the coffee arrived and we drank it... nobody brought us refills of the coffee so we paid and left...."}
{"text":"Calamari was tasty and the portion was very large.  I ordered the linguini pomodoro and added calamari and clams and it was delicious!  Drinks were huge for $5.00 each!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place, just GO! Service is excellent, food is ALWAYS top notch. I've had nearly everything on the menu. I'm very picky with my food and all the dishes rates 'above average' up to 'stellar'! 

Seafood soup is very good and the mushroom soup is one of the best I've ever had, period. The Insalata con Rucola  comes with the raspberry vinaigrette but I recommend the champagne dressing on any salad as it is amazing. My favorite \"normal\" dish is the Pollo alla Genovese.

Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Our first time here, came with a Groupon. I must say we were extremely pleased. Service was excellent, prompt and the food... beyond belief.  We started with Calamari Fritti and Cozze Tarragon (mussel) appetizers.  Sweet and not overpowering tarragon, it was so good I wanted to have a double portion...  The calamari was tender with a garlic mayonaise sauce.  Equally good. And portion size? They don't stint. At all.  Did I make you hungry? Good!!  Come and explore the menu; I won't bore you with the rest of our lunch but be assured,  we weren't disappointed."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining here last evening on clelbration of my wife's birthday.  Food was fabulous..try the veal dishes (Marsala and Picatta) and the Mushroom Soup (Zuppa di Fungi) peppery and just the right amount of spice.  Reminds us of dining in Providence , RI.  Service was great, Boris, our waiter was most attentive and helpful in making our menu choices.  Nice romantic atmosphere, white table cloths, the works.

Now why I rated with 4 stars and not 5 to no fault of the restaurant or staff.  

The table next to us was a different story and almost ruined a nice romantic dinner.  The couple get seated, a middle-aged couple, (he was wearing a ball cap and once removed the was balding) guessing both in their early 50's. Then they both start on their mobile phones..ugh. Not once did they stop..searching the web, making calls, receiving calls, etc. HOW DAMN RUDE. Plus it was obvious they had a GroupOn for $40 and tried to stay in that limit and order food to go. When the food came he (Mr. Bald Cap) bitched at his wife for ordering the food. Well if he was off his phone long enough he could have figured out what she ordered. GEEZ. The meal continued both on their phones. So I requested the bill and even commented to the Boris the waiter how rude they were and he said that was normal behavior today...NOT ACCEPTABLE PEOPLE. I thought this ugly, rude behavior was limited to our Millenials (our children) BUT NO it is now so prevalent in our older society it is out of control.

Bottom line of the review...do to Va Bene and enjoy a nice meal with great service and tell the people next to you to turn off their DAMN phones for an hour."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the place. We didn't have as attentive of a server as I would have liked, but the food was excellent. I had the Risotto  mare Monte while my friend had the Linguine al Pesto. Both tasted delicious, flavorful, and absolutely fantastic. 
The atmosphere was relaxed and more high-end. Recommended."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful lunch here!  Everything was beautiful, the food, the ambiance and the service!  We had the steak salad and seafood pizza, simply delicious!  Great prices too!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went there last night.   Definitely good food.   The server, Srdjan, was a bit on the \"stuffy\" side, but I suppose that's his personality.   Gets the job done and is competent and efficient.   I asked his opinion about the wine.    He suggested the J Lohr, which suited my palate exactly.  Had the calamari fritti as an appetizer.  It was good.   Not great but good.   We ordered the linguine vongole and the linguine fruitti mare.   I had the linguine fruitti mare.  Since I am not a tomato sauce fan, I talked to Srdjan about it, and he asked if I would like it changed to a white sauce, which I did.   I was great!!   Had quite a bit of shell fish.  The pasta was cooked to perfect and flavored just the way I like it.    My table mate had the linguine vongole, and I was told it was very tasty as well, absolutely no complaints.    Would I go back?   Definitely .  The food and atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"What a joke me and my wife went in for a late dinner the bar bar was full so we went to the dining room . Waited about ten minutes servers bussers and hostesses passed by us so we decided to walk out . On our way out we bump into the manager let him know what happened his response was sorry and he continued on is way ."}
{"text":"Dined here tonight. We arrived around 4 and had a reservation (read some Yelp reviews that it's a must!). Though the dining area was empty when we arrived. After half an hour, a couple more tables started coming. Our waiter, who was pleasant I must say, greeted us and started telling us about their daily special - which I didn't fully grasp (too hungry to listen). We stuck with the regular menu and ordered the Caprese Salad, Prosciutto with Melon, Chicken Pesto Pizza and Chicken and Mushroom Pasta. Waiter said they are out of Prosciutto with Melon so I opted for Beef Carpaccio instead. Food was delivered after about 15 minutes of waiting. Beforehand, the waitstaff gave us complimentary  bread and butter to munch on. Our bread was a bit burnt.  Nevertheless the water was filtered and doesn't have that tap taste. Anyway, food arrived and everything tasted decent. Nothing really popped out, nothing was too exquisite for me to have the urge to go back soon. Since we have a bit of room for dessert, we opted to try their Tiramisu. We ended up wishing we hadn't. I expected that dessert would really be savory and delectable since it is from a restaurant, but I seriously had better ones from the frozen aisles in grocery stores. Meh, maybe it's just me. Then again, I wasn't the only one who didn't find it spectacular. Nevertheless, I think I'll be back. My experience wasn't horrible, it just wasn't spectacular. 

All in all, ambiance is romantic and intimate. Food is so-so. Service is decent. Solid 3 stars!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter and her boyfriend to Va Bene for dinner on Easter. I would have taken them to a nice brunch but they both had to work until 4 o'clock. I read some great reviews and I read some horrific reviews so I decided to come up with my own opinion. We were created promptly by the waiter who seemed as though we were a bother more than a customer. The food runner and busboy were on point they were pleasant. We ordered an appetizer the calamari it was different it was thin rings with a sauce which was very good. It was odd that the waiter took our appetizer and food order together. My daughter and her boyfriend both ordered the pasta with vodka sauce and I ordered the veal Picatta. 
The pasta was a hit and so was the veal though both portions were very small. The veal was $25.95 and in my 38 years of going out for dinner I never paid that much for so little. The meal was served with mashed potatoes set on the plate with an ice cream scoop and the vegetables were under cooked. I can honestly say this was the first time I left a restaurant hungry. 
To finish the meal I ordered the cheese cake if it was made with ricotta cheese the waiter informed me he was not sure how it was made let me check the box. Really check the box even if it did come in a box don't say it. I informed if it is not ricotta cheese I will have the cream brûlée. Well the food runner brought out the cream brûlée. We never asked if we wanted coffee. The decor reminded me of the Italian restaurants in Chicago in the old Italian neighborhoods not for the food quality and portions but the decor. 
Just a note to the owners don't cut the veal paper thin skip the mashed potatoes and offer a side of pasta and make sure the vegetables are cooked."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices. We enjoyed a bottle of wine and great offering of apprizers which the lady and I shared. Thankful we found this little gem in Chandler. The staff was amazing and attentive even though you could tell a large party departed before us. They still accommodated us even after we arrive close to closing time."}
{"text":"Service - excellent! The host was friendly, our server was awesome, gave me great suggestions - i love love love the bread + butter, mussels appetizer.

Food - Portion was great, not too big, the pasta was perfectly cooked (I requested mine to be al dente) i like mine to be spicy so I requested for red crushed chili pepper. SO GOOD!

Overall, was such a great experience, wish my stay in Phoenix was longer. Will definitely going back to this restaurant next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Service - not good.  Food - even worse.  Ambiance for 3 girls celebrating a birthday on a Friday night - yuck.  Long story short - not recommended.

*side note: This review is based on a happy hour experience.  Maybe, just maybe, dining on the other side of the restaurant would have resulted in a better review."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful ambience, and nice owners! I'm even using them for the company holiday lunch!"}
{"text":"Tried Va bene after eyeballing it on Groupon for quite a while. A few days before dinner I called and made a reservation; upon arrival we had to wait. The restaurant is kind of a yin and yang situation; one side is a full loud bar with TVs blaring sports and the other half is the dining area. The tables in the dining room are pretty close and the atmosphere is very loud and chaotic, not relaxing and romantic as I'd hoped.

At first our server seemed really icy and rude but throughout the night he became much more personable. Food wait times were bordering the \"I'm getting very hangry\" point. While the portions were VERY generous, the food was just very average to me. Not bad, not great. I think that on a slower night things could be better; I just don't live close enough to make that gamble."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!

$5 for house wine
appetizers are all half off with the exception of one. I would say the calamari is the best bang for your buck.  You get literally a giant mount and its pretty delicious. I also love the carpaccio.  Very simple but really good. I always find myself wanting to order another plate. the only thing that I didn't enjoy was the escargot. it came wrapped up in a puff pastry with a creamy sauce inside but the puff pastry was very underdone so it was basically still raw on the inside which made for an even chewier experience then the snail itself. but overall I like this place and would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to grab a few appetizers and brings.  

Haven't tried the dinner menu so I can't comment on how their main courses are."}
{"text":"I'm in Phoenix on business and visited this place after my boss raved about it...I sat at the bar which is very spacious; a long triangle of black marble, ringed by a number of small tables and booths. Nice decor, dark and relaxing atmosphere. I ordered some bruchetta and ordered the rigatoni bolognese while watching some ESPN. The place looks pretty upscale.. Fast service, good food, nice digs. $24 for the appetizer, meal and 2 Heinees. Not bad. I'll be back next time I'm in town...
Oh yeah, my boss asked me to look out for this beauty named 'Shannon' at the bar...no luck."}
{"text":"For being an Italian restaurant, they sure do have amazing steak! Every time I come here I order the bacon wrapped filet mignon, it is one of the best steaks I've ever had! Our waiters have always been fantastic, and even though they don't always offer that specific dish, they will usually make it for me anyways. I love that it's quiet and romantic, and it can be casual or formal. Great bar area as well, we really love this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I selected Va Bene for our wedding reception. We were having a small wedding, 40 people, and had heard Va Bene was an excellent restaurant.

The wait staff and food was delicious. We could have not have asked for better service or food for our reception. People complemented the service and food - for that I would have given 5 stars...

However, I took a couple of stars off due to the manager Donna and lack of communication. We originally started talking back in November over email as we live in NYC. It was easy enough to book and she provided us with a simple menu which we were pleased with. I emailed her to ask to meet with her in February as I was flying out to finalize things before the April wedding. She agreed (we did have to change the date since my flight was cancelled and rescheduled, but she agreed to meet me at the same time the following day). When I arrived Donna was not there - they had no idea that I was coming or when Donna would be in. We waited for a half an hour before Sasha helped us - I was ready to change the venue. Sasha was helpful and nice and offered a food tasting during the week. We came back for the food tasting and Donna met us - although she acted as though she couldn't be bothered with us. Michele, another manager from my understanding, took care of us.  Without Sasha or Michele I would have changed the venue. 

Donna was also very hard after that to get in contact with. She took up to a week to respond to us, and the only time we really got any information was when Michele took over the emailing while Donna was on vacation. Additionally, Donna forgot to inform Michele that my husband would be by the day of the wedding to drop things off - we agreed at 3:30 so the room would be ready. When he arrived nothing was set up...

In the end, the food, wait staff, Michele and Sasha were wonderful. I would eat there again, however, I would shy away from arranging another big event."}
{"text":"A mixed bag.  The melons in the melon and prosciutto appetizer were the crunchiest I've ever eaten, the mozzarella was so-so, and the pasta was cooked past al dente.  There were some nice individual flavors, with the chicken and artichoke in a dijon sauce being quite tasty, but no dish we ordered really came together well.  Also, the service, while friendly and gracious (they comped us a glass of wine to make up for its slow delivery), went through a rough patch during our visit. Our water glasses were not refilled, dirty plates remained on the table for 20 minutes after our meal was finished, and the waitress brainfarted our creme brûlée order out of existence.  Which is ok - we didn't need dessert, but we did kinda want it :)."}
{"text":"Hosted a party of 10 people for my husband's birthday and was very pleased with the food, service, and ambiance. My husband is 2nd generation Italian and he grew up with his great grandmother making gnocchi every Sunday duing the winter time. So of course he had to order the gnocchi! The verdict? Rediculously good and some of the best since his grandmother's! I ordered the linguini puttanesca with a glass of white wine and they were just as delicious. We will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Great place. Ate snails for the first time, shared different apps with some friends and hung out on their clean and ultra sleek patio. The general manager was super nice and personally came out to check on us several times throughout our visit. Great happy hour with reasonable prices and perfect top shelf martinis."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a wonderful atmosphere and gives the impression that it's fine dining, however it was very mediocre.

Our waiter walked away from us while we were ordering our drinks and said \"hold on\" before coming back, which was rude. 

We ordered the clams and they were so salty they were inedible and i can handle salt. The waiter gave us an excuse about where the clams come from and that's why they're salty. After saying we didn't want them, he awkwardly offered the mussels which we accepted. They were over cooked and cold. The white wine broth tasted like water.

I ordered the ribeye and orzo Risotto that was on their specials. The steak was cooked correctly but I don't believe it was a ribeye cut because it tasted like a steak from Marie Calendars and despite looking pink and delicious it was still somehow tough and chewy. The risotto was very good though.

All in all the food is way over priced for the quality. I would not come back here."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Va Bene thru Doordash.  I got the fettuccine with clams, mussels, scallops and shrimp.  I also ordered the appetizer Melanzane Ripieni which is eggplant stuffed with squash and ricotta and WOW.  I've never seen this item on a menu before, and since I'm adventurous, I decided to give it a shot and now it's my favorite thing ever.  I'll have to try out my cooking skills with this one.  Anyway, TONS of seafood in the Frutti di Mer and the sauce was delish.  Next time I order I might ask for an extra side of marinara. Also, I got the Pasta E Fagioli because I always order that when it's on a menu and that too was so yummy.  This place really feels like the italian restaurants I miss from back east."}
{"text":"Great service, nice atmosphere. I had the gnocchi and it was heavenly. The tiramisu tastes homemade. Definitely an authentic Italian experience, will be going back again."}
{"text":"Quiet exquisite atmosphere! Will definitely recommend to colleagues and friends!
Escargots! Great experience!"}
{"text":"The eggplant appetizer was delicious as was the rest of our food. A+ rigatoni. Cooked to perfection. The service was great and the food is superb. Going to recommend this restaurant to everyone at work!"}
{"text":"Food was good, not spectacular. Service was fair. Had to ask for utensils no fresh cracked pepper or cheese. Have had better."}
{"text":"My book club met there for Happy Hour last month and if my review was based solely on that experience, I would've given 4 stars. Great lounge with ample seating, good music (loud, but not too loud, we had no problem hearing each other speak across a table of 6) and GREAT PRICES. I had 3 glasses of Chianti, the grilled veggies and the little-neck clams (with plenty of bread to sop up the delicious buttery wine sauce) and the check was just $25! Holy bargains Batman!

Unfortunately, my recent Friday night visit (6:45 - 9pm) did not leave me so giddy...
There was no room in the main dining room and since this was Date Night with the hubby (as opposed to Fire Sale at The Local Meat Market) we opted for the \"quiet side of the patio\" out front. Unlike the inside, VB's front patio has ZERO ambience. And with no twinkle lights or even a faint stream of music, the view of the parking lot reinforces thoughts of hopping in the car and heading elsewhere...
As far as the food goes, it started off GREAT. The scallops appetizer was nothing short of perfect (my husband concurs)--sauteed in a pesto and SO juicy. The side of greens was an ideal accompaniment, with a light vinaigrette. The entrees, on the other hand, were so disappointing... The veal marsala was meh: while it was tender enough to cut with a fork, the sauce was very generic, almost tasted like brown gravy, which is exactly what ny husband said about the sauce on his ahi tuna dish. As far as the sides of potatoes & veggies that came with the meals--on par with your average cafeteria, and unfortunately, there was no salt nor pepper on the table to remedy the absolute blandness. By the time the waitress got back to our table, I had decided not to bother requesting seasonings, as they were already cold.
The dessert (chocolate cheesecake) was passable, but tasted prepackaged.
As far as the service, she seemed a bit overwhelmed and unencouraging with regard to our food choices...
Although we used a Groupon and therefore paid almost half of what the bill would've normally been, we were still underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Had the seafood pasta.  Seafood was a little better than an average restaurant and the pasta noodles were way too soft (waiter said would be al dente).  Wouldnt go back."}
{"text":"Va bene is such a great place to have drinks or dinner. The staff is so so friendly! The manager, Rick, I always so welcoming. The bartenders and staff are equally as friendly and so attentive. I recommend the pasta...it's all so delicious. When I've gone in I've noticed a lot of familiar faces so they get a lot of regulars and I think that speaks highly of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I was super impressed with this establishment. To begin with, our waiter had an Italian accent. Not sure if it was legit or not, but it added to the ambience and experience of our meal. The waiter asked if we were interested in hearing about the specials. I decided to order the filet mignon special.
The wait for our food was a long one. They did keep our drinks full, and the bread basket and butter held us over.
The filet was melt in your mouth. Absolutely delicious! It was not over cooked, rather, it had just the right amount of pink. The sauce was divine. The green beans were very fresh and quite delicious as well. The mashed potatoes weren't great, nothing to brag about.
After our meal. The waiter asked if we would be having dessert. Uh, duh! I was torn between the Creme brûlée and cheesecake. I decided to go for the Creme brûlée. It was definitely over carmelized and had to scoot most of the over charred to the side.
Overall, a wonderful dining experience. Intimate ambience and wonderful service."}
{"text":"Happy hour here is amazing; half price appetizers, and good deals on yummy drinks. My favorite appetizer was the calamari-which was probably the best I've ever had. They also bring out complementary hot fresh baked bread-served with sun-dried tomatoes herb butter. SO GOOD! We ordered many other appetizers and drinks throughout the evening and all were delicious. I cannot wait to come back to try entrees and deserts."}
{"text":"Went here on a Groupon and the customer service in the bar and main dining room is outstanding.  That being said the food is an Italian find.
The happy hour is very reasonable $5.00 clams yummy all the appetizers except 1 is 1/2 price.

Sergio in the dining room is wonderful and is very patient at I asked  a lot
of questions on all the entries.  He offered a parmesan chicken that was not on the menu with fetachini it was delicious  and the gnocchi was knock it out the park.  Husband had the Linguine Frutti di Mare and was bowled over with the flavors, amount of fish, etc.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"What a great experience! The lounge is great for happy hour and they serve the best pineapple martinis. Randy at the bar is perfection. We have an Airbnb minutes away and have put it in our guide book because this place is so amazing. We live in San Diego but coming here is one of our favorite things about Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Classy as can be, but casual at the same time. Wonderful happy hour with half price appys and drink specials. Pretty much every appy is amazing. Fun friendly bartenders too! Will come again and again."}
{"text":"My wife & I have dinned at Va Bene off & on for 4 years. When we want clams we either go there or to the Salt Cellar in Scottsdale. Yesterday ( mothers day), I phoned Va Bene ahead of time  to make sure they would accept groupon before I went online to buy it. The young lady on the phone said yes, so I purchased it.
My wife and I are in our 60's and enjoy eating at the bar. When we tried to order clams the bartender said they were out of clams. It was around 5 pm. For a Italian restaurant not to have clams is like a ice cream parlor that doesn't offer ice cream but there were other food options we entertained. After spending $75 for 4 drinks & food we presented our groupon & credit card for payment only to have a lady by the name of Donna flat get in our face and told us she wasn't allowing us to use the groupon. No apologizes, just total rudeness. She was extremely indignant & unprofessional, enough for our bartender to be embarrassed. My wife & I felt very insulted by this person and from now on we will dine at the other restaurant that offers excellent service & always has clams. Last but not least, after buying the groupon I found an older one that we had't used that indicates \"never expires\". Donna indicated she would never honor that one as well."}
{"text":"Paid for the Groupon, also used a 20%off coupon so I paid $20 for $40 worth of food. Unbelievable price to try something new! This is an authentic Italian spot with real Italian waiters and cooks. The smell of the restaurant made my stomach growl and mouth water. Remember to dress nicely when coming here, I felt under-dressed wearing khakis. A candle lit dinner was nice but my table was unstable and wobbly. The waiter was hardly checking up on us, it felt like he had better places to be. We ordered the chicken mushroom dish and it was spectacular. Also ordered creme brûlée and it was very delicious but they burnt the sugar on top  too much so it became very bitter... Food: 5 stars 
Service: 2  If I come back, it'll mainly be to try another dish."}
{"text":"I was talked into going here by my wife who had been previously. I was somewhat skeptical having had a favorite Italian restaurant for many years that just recently closed. What a pleasant surprise! This place feels like the family restaurant that it is. It's not a corporate debacle. 
Great band, comfortable seating, very attentive staff. It seems like we got there at the right time because seating wasn't an issue and the drinks showed up right away. If you're looking for a place you can walk into and be immediately comfortable I recommend this."}
{"text":"Oh how I love great Italian...let me count the ways. Great pasta, super satisfying calamari, nice selection of California wines and imports (by the glass). The ambiance is refined, relaxed and modern. I simply cannot wait to return here - especially after the no smoking law goes into effect at the bar. Friendly staff, great service, delicious food. In the 'burbs and worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early Mother's day dinner this afternoon in the dining room and was quite pleased with the experience at Va Bene.

The waitstaff was excellent, we didn't have to wave anyone down when our glasses started to look a little low, the bread basket was always full (and their tomato basil butter was delicious, too!)

It was a little pricey, but the food quality was certainly worth the price paid, imo.  I would certainly recommend Va Bene for anyone that would like an attainable, upscale Italian dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"k...  Here is the deal.  I would give this place a 5 if I had never had east coast italian.  Fot italian food anywhere I think this is a great place though. Really cool decor. Loved the bar. Our bartender Frank was a really cool guy.  

The fact that this place is a cougar heaven makes it extra cool (Cougars need lovin too!)

I think the best italian I have had in phoenix.  Had a spinach salad and bruschetta which was SO good.  Bruschetta was one of the best I have had anywhere.

Had a Sausage and peppers in a red Cream Sauce.  Very very tasty.  Food was way better than I thought it would be.  

Just might go for happy hour today because I am cravin the itailian and the cougar atmosphere is a good one."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this restaurant last night on recommendations from a friend. It was a Tuesday night around 7:30, and we were dressed casually, so when the hostess told us we could sit in the bar area (which is very large) we opted for that. Probably not the best choice, because as the night went on the music got louder. 
We found their wine list adequate and ordered a lovely bottle of Valley of the Moon sangiovese. That was probably the best thing we had all night, sadly. Our server was lovely, I must say. Very charming and upbeat. We ordered the calamari appetizer to share, which was pretty good. The batter and sauce were tasty, the squid a little chewy. But I liked that it came with a salad of romaine and tomatoes on the side. Good combination! Then came the entrees..I had the Veal Marsala and my husband ordered the New York Steak medium rare. The Veal was good and tender, but the mushroom sauce tasted like it came right out of a can. My husbands steak was cooked medium well, not rare, which he was very grumpy about. And the veggies they served along side were cold and hard and obviously frozen. One more chance: dessert. We ordered a tiramisu to share...on the recommendation of our server....and it was very ordinary, and tasted like it came from a grocery store. 
I have heard this place does have a great happy hour and I saw they did grey goose martinis (my favorite) If we were ever to return, I wouldn't mind trying those! And probably munch on the calamari....and forget the rest of the food."}
{"text":"I'd give the food a 3/5 and the actual restaurant a 5/5. The food was really just okay, but this place looks GREAT!"}
{"text":"Great food and nice atmosphere. Service was good and prompt. Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Really like this place. The food is great.  I love the mussels. Bartender very good. Good place to meet up with a friend like I did."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour! Appetizers half price except prosciutto wrapped shrimp. The Calamari Fritti is soooo good and is served with salad so you can make a salad or eat each separately! The Melanzane Ripieni (eggplant and squash-both I love) was good, but extremely cheesy (which many will like!) Good drink prices for happy hour and a nice fire pit table outside if you want to attempt it in the winter :) I will be back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Very nice \"upper-crust\" Italian place.  Pastas were typically $12-15 and Special entrees were typically $15-$30.  I visited on a Thursday night, no waiting, and few people there.  Very nice, comfy decor with red velvet drapes, dim lighting, white table-cloths, and picasso-like paintings all around.  Service was ok...the water-boy was good, but the waiter sporadically came by my table...always a bit late, and two waiters actually waited on me.  The menu had too much cream and pink sauce for me.   No whole wheat pastas.  One waiter actually helped me design my own meal which was nice.  I asked for a small side of arrabbiata  sauce expecting a hot red sauce, but made a cheesy, creamy mushroom sauce for me instead.  The complimentary bread was a bit stale and came with a cheesy stiff buttery kinda sauce...I had to ask for olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  They have a dining room and a separate lounge with a live jazzy band.  I think there's a private conference room too."}
{"text":"We had out of town friends that we took to dinner. We all enjoyed the atmosphere, the service and the food! We have been to Va Bene numerous times and we were not disappointed at all!"}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED. We were excited to come here after reading the great Yelp reviews but wow were they misleading. The food is good but it took over an hour to get when everyone around us that got there after us got their food first. Our waiter straight up ignored us and wouldn't come to see us or the people sitting near us. When we asked for him to come see us they sent someone else and they made an excuse how a big party ordered before us. Well, that is understandable but it was not understandable that other people that ordered the same thing got it before us. Pasta does not take 1.5 hours to make. Also, once we finally found our waiter he smelt of strong cigarette smoke and it was obvious that he was outside smoking the whole time we were not being helped. I do want to mention the guys that fill the water and bring the bread were nice! They should be the waiters you guys have and fire your current waiters! We won't be back."}
{"text":"You've heard the expression, \"you only have one chance to make a good impression\", right?  Hmmmmm...hold that thought.

I saw Va Bene reviewed on PBS Arizona's, \"Check Please\". It's not at all convenient to where I live so I waited until I was \"near\" and decided to try it. (I was \"near\" all right: still took 25 minutes on I-10 to go from the 60 to Chandler Blvd).

I walked in and the place was hopping!  The bartender, alone, was crushed, waaaaaay too much bar for one person, yet she was friendly and efficient.

I asked The Guy In The Black Suit about appetizers and he assured me the right pick would be the mussels with marinara, Italian sausage, peppers and onions (\"Cozi Va Bene\"). It came out in good time, the marinara was amateurish. 

Before I filled up on bread, I ordered the Chicken Marsala and 35 (!) minutes later, I complained, it got fired right away and delivered- and it was not acceptable.  Not cooked. Problem in the kitchen. 

The Guy In The Black Suit comp'd my drinks and the uneaten entree but he couldn't comp the disappointment. Consider the gap between a TV exhibition so impressive that I made the effort to try a restaurant on a night bursting at the seams under the weight of too few staffed employees. 

Though this restaurant was WAS out of my way, I've got no problem driving a distance  for a great meal. This experience was a complete and utter failure and, no, I won't be back. For any reason.  Enjoy the exposure from the PBS spot. Waste of my time."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here early on a Friday evening without reservations.  We were seated immediately.  I liked the ambiance very much but felt the food did not live up to the upscale atmosphere.  We would have been happier at any number of chain Italian restaurants that do not make their food from scratch.

I had the cream of mushroom soup that tasted like Campbell's, fortunalty... I like Campbells.  I asked the waiter if the pasta was made fresh... NO.  So I ordered the one item that is made fresh... the gnocchi.  It was very mushy like paste and the sauce tasted like it came from a can.  We also tried the pesto pasta which was meh.  We did not finish any of our pasta courses.  We skipped the main course and went straight to the dessert.  Once again, I ordered the only thing made fresh in house which was the cream brûlée.  It was from the fridge... cold in the center and also meh.  The other dessert we tried was the chocolate cheese cake, not made on the premises, which was good."}
{"text":"Took wife to Va Bene for her birthday. There were 4 of us, We started with Bruschetta \"Va Bene\" and Antipasto Misto. Wife had the Filet Medallions and they were wonderful. I had the Gnocchi alla Vodka and I will have it again. We paired dinner with a nice Chianti. Food and wine was wonderful.

Only negative was in desert. I had Creme Brulee which was served cold so the top was nor as crispy as it should have been.

We will go again both for the restaurant and the bar."}
{"text":"Our first time there and it was great! Nice atmosphere! Food was delicious and service was wonderful! Staff was very attentive and totally worked as a team! The general manager came by and checked on us and introduced himself, really cannot say enough about the service! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for many, many, many years.  I believe reviews should be based on several experiences and NEVER judged on one excellent or poor experience.  For my family Va Bene has always been very consistent.  Absolutely fabulous Italian food with both the standard menu items along with insanely great specialty dishes.  Not much more I can add as pretty simple place to review."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and was not disappointed. Food, service and ambiance were all excellent.
Beer was cold and the pricing was ok. 
Looking forward to the next visit"}
{"text":"The food here is really good! They have amazing happy hour deals too. The downside to that is you'll be surrounded by an older crowd. Diners beware: You might end up on a Cougars plate. Our waiter was really nice, friendly, and attentive. I had the Fettuccine Con Pollo & Fungi which was awesome!! Their bread is pretty tasty too! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love their happy hour! Killer martinis!"}
{"text":"The food is good.  The service is spotty.  The happy hour deals are good and the atmosphere in the bar area is great for happy hour. Stick to the pasta dishes as the higher end entrees aren't anything specatular."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to celebrate our anniversary somewhere special because we've had an extremely difficult year and we needed a cause for celebration.  We had one of our first dates at Va Bene and loved it so much (the only time I would have given it five stars, but that was a long time ago) that we booked the restaurant for our wedding reception.  As most brides, I don't remember much of the reception, but I was surprised to hear bad feedback several weeks after the wedding about the restaurant/reception/dinner from our guests (including my matron of honor who recommended the restaurant to us initially for our date)...so maybe they don't do wedding receptions well..I cut them some slack.  We decided to give them another try for our first anniversary and the food was awful, but the service was worse.  We left so disappointed that we didn't return until last night (many years later) at my husband's suggestion (he wanted a romantic evening).  After reading the great yelp reviews, I thought they had recovered their mojo, but they did not.  We arrived in time for our 7pm reservation, of which they did not have a record...and the hostess didn't apologize, but blamed their systems.  They were practically empty, so they had plenty of room and instead, seated us against the far wall near the kitchen entrance and a large loud table.  I mentioned to the hostess and again to our server that we were celebrating our anniversary.  The server never asked us if we wanted drinks (but we had plenty of water).  One would think that for restaurant that promotes itself as a martini and wine bar, the server would ask about drinks.  If he had asked, we may have purchased their most expensive champagne, but he never asked, never gave us a wine list and he hurried us through a cocktail-less meal.  The calamari appetizer, while huge (because it was served with a salad) was frozen.  I ordered the Va Bene salad and it was soggy. My husband ordered the linguini with seafood and it was salty and my fish (the special) was bland, the spinach was overcooked and the potatoes were undercooked.  The best thing we had was their butter for our bread. Our server did bring us a slice of cheesecake to celebrate our anniversary (I was expecting Italian style cheesecake, but it was the heavy cream NY style cheesecake...it tasted fine, but just not what I expected), but he never asked us if we wanted coffee, tea, after dinner drinks or a different dessert.  I looked around at all the other tables and they had wine, beer, coffee and tea. So I thought, \"what about our faces said we are in a hurry to get home\"?  Our date night was an hour long and really, really disappointing.  We were hurried out of an empty restaurant at 8pm.  We will not be returning for any future anniversaries.  Three strikes and Va Bene, you are out!  Our marriage on the other hand, will survive this less than ideal anniversary dinner and we will celebrate next year at an establishment that considers an anniversary special."}
{"text":"I always liked the food here. Their salmon was awesome. Their prime rib was tasty as hell. I tried their lamb shanks which were alright. I had better lamb shanks at Byblos for sure. They have good wine choice and their ambience is good."}
{"text":"Great Italian style restaurant.  They have a cool bar and patio section.  They have live music some nights.  Cool spot."}
{"text":"The service was good and the food was excellent.  

This was our second time to this restaurant, the first time for a family event of 8 as we used a gift card  with many restaurants options.  We did use the second of our 4 'card/coupons' this evening for Va Bene.  Both experiences were excellent. 

Certificate or not, excellent food and service."}
{"text":"Va Bene is one of the best places in chandler! I love the atmosphere, drinks, and the manager Sasha Perric was nothing but accommodating and friendly! I will certainly be back with my friends and family. Thank you Va Bene and Sasha :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. I got the filet mignon for $40 and it literally had no taste to it. On top of that it was the special of the night. It was one of the worst filet mignon I have ever had. I don't like to give 2 stars, but that's how bad it was. Not only would I not suggest this place to anyone else, but will never be going back; very disappointed."}
{"text":"Vabenne is one of the best if not the best Italian restaurants in Arizona. My favorites are the tarragon mussels, Cesar salad and the Pollo Con Fungi (Chicken Fettuccine with mushrooms)! Everything you could ask for in an Italian meal! Sooooo good! Happy hour in the bar is the way to go as it cuts your bill in half and you can watch a game on the Ty's or hear live music on Friday nights."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here for Happy Hour,  especially when it's just before sunset! They have a really nice seating area outside with a fire pit with surround seating! We love the calamari con misto, prosciutto con melon, prosecco, chicken picatta, fettuccine alfredo, tonight I tried risotto with shrimp and mushrooms and it was amazingly good! They also have amazing chicken pesto pizza and tiramisu! Their lemon drop Martini is delish!"}
{"text":"Management has changed and it shows and not in a good way.  We were there for 4 hours and should have been out in 2.5.  The service is horrendous - aside from being slow, they are not the friendliest folks in the world.  Instead of having 2-3 hostesses sitting at the front desk twiddling their thumbs, put them to work and have them refill waters and clear tables because the wait staff and bus boys can't maintain the level of service there once was.  The food is sub-par - I had to return the Carpaccio because it was truly disgusting.  We had 6 people in our group and there were 3-4 separate checks for the group.  Why are they adding 20% gratuity on each of the checks for a party of 6.  Unreal and uncalled for.  The ceiling needs work - there are huge open vents with freezing cold air blowing through them.  Hope they can get their act together, or they will lose their client base."}
{"text":"I have been here few times for happy hours, always love their martini choice. My husband and I took my sister for dinner,  the Apple martini always is my favorite drink. The clams steamed sauce is so good with their bread. My sister love the Chicken pasta with cream sauce. The meat ball just like the grandma homemade, We can not stop eating it.
The service was very good and friendly, My sister ask \" Can we come back again before I went back?\" We will denfinitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this \"hidden gem\"! Brett is an amazing bar tender and Rick, the manager is constantly engaged with his customers! The food is always wonderful and the portion size is perfect. The drinks a great too! We love the fact that they have live entertainment on the weekends and the small dance floor gets crowded. This is definitely our \"go to \" when we are on that side of town. We really enjoy their other lounge \"VB Lounge\", which is closer to where we live. Bother worth checking out! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went for an early lunch on a weekday.  The restaurant was pretty empty, but it was just open, like I said it was early.  The restaurant itself is very beautiful.  The service was perfectly fine.  The food was great.  

The tomato bruschetta was excellent.  The gnocchi (specifically ordered due to William H, 8/18/12 yelp review) was very very good.  

Not ready to give 5 stars yet, would like to go and see how they do when busier.  But I will go back!"}
{"text":"Okay, I cannot say enough good things about this place. Yum. Yum yum yum yum YUM! This is hands-down the BEST Italian restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of eating at. I went for a celebratory dinner with my boyfriend after one year together and the atmosphere in the dining room was just lovely. Very romantic.

Now on to my favorite part: the food. My guy had the Penne Sicilian, which was good, but not really something to rave about. I had the Gnocchi alla Vodka, a, and I quote, \"homemade potato gnocchi in a pink vodka sauce with shallots, fresh tomatoes and a touch of cream\". Absolutely heavenly. I scraped all the sauce off my plate just to be able to taste how wonderful it was until the very end. The homemade gnocchi was exactly the right texture and the whole dish just worked together so wonderfully. You need to try this. You deserve to try this! I dream about dishes like this one, seriously.

The dessert was also fantastic. We split a raspberry tartufo (we were so stuffed from the huge portions of pasta) and it was a great finish to the dinner. The final bill wasn't ridiculous, especially for the quality of the food (on my end, at least) and the atmosphere. I thought it was very reasonable and will definitely be looking forward to my next visit there soon."}
{"text":"Found this place on Idine and tried it for lunch. Very nice place with a very large bar. On the high end side if that is what you are looking for. Food was excellent and service was very good. I had the linguine with chicken and mushrooms in a cream sauce with a glass of white wine. They brought over some good crusty French bread and I had a wonderful food experience. What I also liked was that the menu was overloaded. You have enough to pick from but not too much so you know the chef can do everything properly and fresh. Will go back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Our third visit to Va Bene this month, and we have become fans! Rick, the GM, has been most cordial and helpful, and Daniel was a very efficient server, as was Laurie in the lounge... although Sergio was overwhelmed when we went on a Saturday evening, The Martinis and Calamari were wonderful [and quite inexpensive] when we went to Happy Hour... and the Sea Bass [Basso] was one of the best that we have had. We plan to return regularly!"}
{"text":"This place is an Italian restaurant with decent food and and very good wine list with prices and ambiance leaning toward the upscale.  I had been here once with my sister for dinner shortly after they opened and found the prices to be higher than the quality of food and service warranted and so promptly forgot about it and never came back (and apparently never even wrote a review).

Flash forward to last Friday night when I am out with a bunch of ladies celebrating not one but two birthdays. We were in a party mood and so opted to sit in the bar area.  Boy, we did not know what we were in for.  Crazy loud music with a total meat market atmosphere. Unfortunately the band that night was a funk/r&b band which is not at all our style. After watching the cougars stalk their prey and the odd couples on the dance floor gyrate to Prince and Parliament songs for a couple hours, I was ready to get out of there. I think with a different band I may have enjoyed it a little more but I generally prefer a more laid back atmosphere and to be able to talk to my friends at the table without having to shout.

On the plus side, the food was very good.  My favorite Italian place in this part of town is Vincitorio's (on Elliott and McClintock) but I don't really care for their linguine with clams dish so I took advantage and ordered it here at Va Bene and it did not disappoint one bit.  I mean, it was so good I ate the whole thing and then mopped up the sauce with the rest of the bread in the basket.  Yum!  I also sampled some of my neighbors Gnocchi and that was fantastic as well.  Everyone at the table of 8 girls seemed to love their food and we all ordered different wines by the glass and no one was disappointed in that, either.

So, if you are in Ahwatukee looking for good Italian food and good wine and you don't mind spending a few extra bucks then this is a good option (Caffe Boa just up the road is a more affordable with same ambiance) but don't come on a Friday or Saturday night unless you are looking to party, hook-up, or shake your booty... or maybe all three!"}
{"text":"I took a client out to eat at Va Bene's, one of my favorite local restaurants. After waiting a half hour for a salad, they completely screwed it up. My client nicely, but rightfully rejected it, and the asshole waiter literally patted my 60-year-old CEO client on her head (WTF!) and told her it was fine even though it was loaded with the very foods she had specifically requested be left off. Not cool!  He didn't like my request to take it back and sabatoged every aspect of the meal for the reminder of the night, from ignoring us, screwing up what were supposed to be free desserts, mischarging us, dumping off take-home boxes with no bag, serving the meal without silverware, and just generally providing horrendous service that was unbefitting for this establishment. This s*it show dragged on for 2 hrs with mistake after mistake and major attitude. I was deeply embarrassed and will never be back, let alone ever bring a client."}
{"text":"Don't come here after 9pm to have a nice dinner. That was around the time the bar gets hopping...with old people. They were loud and took away from the restaurant experience. Luckily for them the food saved them on this review. The main course was good and so was the tiramisu. The bread was good but they don't give you much. The kind they give you comes with a olive oil type butter that was interesting and pretty good."}
{"text":"So husband and I decided to try a new place, wow disappointing. They served him chicken with what tasted like canned cream of chicken soup poured over it, cold mashed potatoes & mushy vegetables. I had the pizza it was alright, wine was good (had to ask for Moscato not on wine menu) the booth next to us looked like there was a mob hit, big hole. The paint was peeling from the ceiling from water damage. I ordered a slice of the cheesecake to go, got home and found it to be unetible! Completely dried out must have been in the refrigerator for about a week. Sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"First, there are not that many Maserati's!!!  

A visit to Va Bene is not complete unless you start at the bar.  Matt knows how to tend bar and take care of his regular customers.  The scallops are no longer a part of the 1/2 price appetizers during happy hour.....be a big boy, buck up and buy them anyway, worth every last penny. 

If you find your way in after happy hour - expect to find dancing and large crowds in the bar.  This is the place for adults to see and be seen in The Tuke!

On the restaurant side, dinners are terrific and the Chef's Specials should always be considered.  Great service and friendly staff.

Va Bene is a gem in the area.  Great food, staff and reasonable prices.  A great place for dinner - just watch out for the cougars!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. We had Lemon-Drop and Cosmopolitan Martinis, and two of the Pollo con Pesto pizzas, along with their complimentary bread is to die for. The dance floor gets crowded on Friday night, but it is a wonderful place to have fun with friends and family."}
{"text":"Terrible. I don't usually write reviews but this must be said. I'm pregnant and would eat anything but after tonight's experience everything BUT Va Bene. Now I know what it tastes like to drown in ocean water because that's what my meal tasted like, a mouthful of salty sea water. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a late lunch. Had been here once before and enjoyed it. This time we both enjoyed lunch salmon salad and linguini alla pesto with Rocky Point shrimp. A screwdriver and Chardonnay complimented the meal perfectly as did the service at the bar by Peter ... a great lunch!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why this place has such high ratings.
First off, upon walking in and letting the seating hostess know we would like to sit in the dining area, as the lounge was BLASTING with music, mind you, I LOVE MUSIC, but it sounded like a full blown stadium concert, I asked where the bathroom was, she pointed and said very edgy, \"Last door.\" I figured that she was trying to be straightforward because of how loud it was.
I found my boyfriend in the lounge and he said he was glad I had gone to the bathroom because when he walked in the manager or supervisor was yelling at his employees, dropping \"f\" bombs and didn't even have the decency to at least close the curtain. While he is telling me this, I hear more yelling, we try to ignore it and enjoy our night.
We got our food and OMG!!! Can you say SALTY!?! And that doesn't go just for their food but a bit towards our waiter, as well. With food that salty, at least make sure I have water so I can wash it down, and don't look at me like I'm a bother when I politely ask for more water and am the only one in the dining area.
My boyfriend is also one of those, when we go out, he wants an appetizer, main course and dessert but before he could even ask about dessert, the waiter came with our check, dropped it on the table and left, at least he cleared our plates as he walked away.
Overall, the only good thing was their warm bread that came with tomato basil butter and the guy who wasn't even our server but was there to help out.
We will not be returning."}
{"text":"We Love this place! Although the food is to die for, and they have some good vegetarian options, my review will focus on the wine bar/entertainment.

 There are very few places around town that a person who is not in their 20's anymore can get their groove on. This is it! 

Va Bene is an upscale (read: no base ball hats) wine bar that has a full bar, a dance floor and a stage! The decor is very classy with deep red long velvet drapes. Seating is around the HUGE bar, tall tables that seat 4 with white tablecloths and intimate booths (yes, IN THE BAR!)  They have great outdoor patio space on 2 sides of the restaurant with heat lamps in the winter and a nice counter height fire pit.

Va Bene hosts the best bands around like The Soul Solution (these girls can SING!!) and the sax player Todd is amazing!) and Contra Band. The bartenders and wait staff are friendly and make really great drinks. Try the Chocolatini!

The crowd is a high energy, great mix of everyone and it can get quite crowded between 9 and 11pm. You will see anything from sequins to nice jeans to suits.

FYI  The 2 corner bar seats on the left are reserved for my friend Kiki and I when the Soul Solution is playing. If you sit there you will be glared at by everyone. Lol!"}
{"text":"Located thousands of miles from Tuscany is no challenge to this fabulous Italian Ristorante. I wish my stomach could accommodate more as every dish is elegant and delicious. Sipping on a bottle of Sartori Pinot Grigio and sampling our 4 course dinner is the epitome of Italian cuisine. Do yourself a flavor and book your reservation today."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for happy hour or after hour drinks. I recommend dining in the bar/lounge as the dining room is a little stiff. The bar is elegant and large with very comfortable bar stools. There are several TVs which are usually playing a sporting game of some sort. Our bartender, Tyler, was fantastic! They offer generously sized $6 martinis with well liquor. The price drops to $4.50 for happy hour, which is unbeatable!

Unfortunately, I wasn't terribly impressed with the food. It wasn't bad by any means but it was lacking. The pasta was quite overcooked, there was way too much cheese on the salads (thick slabs of bland mozzarella), the chicken piccata was somewhat bland, the sausage was extremely undercooked. So much so that we had it sent back to the kitchen. Tyler was very cool about it and gave us a cocktail on the house. 

Although I'm a little disappointed with the food, I very much approve of the laid back bar scene and the extra friendly bartenders. With a little added passion in the kitchen, they will be well on their way to being one of the hottest spots in town. 

Give it a shot, you may really enjoy it! It's got lots of potential."}
{"text":"Came here Friday night for date night with my husband and we had a wonderful time. The wait staff were very friendly and helpful with the menu. They have a great menu and their food is delicious! The atmosphere there is very nice  and such a great place to go for a nice dinner with your significant other. I love this place and we will definitely be back for more. They also have a great happy hour in the bar."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the most consistently great places I visit. I'm a bar-person who tends to also make use of the patio. Everyone, from the bartender to the bus staff, always says hello and offers help. The food is fantastic and the weekend music is always a plus."}
{"text":"Ok so this place would have been 5 stars if my creme brûlée wasn't burnt, yes I'm that picky. Lol. 

Let me start off by saying the waiter was awesome on point and always following up with us, he gave suggestions and always had a smile in his face. Now for the food- we started off with the calamari and it was AWESOME....I asked if the had Cannelloni but I was out of luck fortunately the waiter suggested something else the chicken pasta with mushrooms (not the correct name but you should be able to find it on the menu) and it was great. The over all atmosphere was great and service was on point. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"First time we've been to this place and it started off good but went down from there. Our waiter never checked on us. Never asked how our food tasted or refilled drinks. Too bad for him because I would have loved another glass of wine but I was never asked. The food was very salty for me. The hostess never thanked us for coming in, she just sat there on her phone texting. For this kind of service and not really great food, I don't think it's worth the money."}
{"text":"I always say \"No one does Northern Italian cuisine well in Arizona!\", but I am absolutely wrong!  Va Bene is the epitome of fine, affordable, Northern Italian cuisine!  In fact, I order one of the specials every time I go and they are simply as good as it gets.  I tip my hat off to their chef -- I will never say you can't find good Italian food in the Phoenix area, again.  I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"great service and the food is excellent.  I usually have the rigatoni bolognese or the gnocchi in vodka cream sauce they both are outstanding if your in the mood for pasta.  they have a great happy hour and live music Friday and Saturdays."}
{"text":"We were in a party of about 20.  We had 1 waiter. We sat there over a hour for bread to arrive.  Service was horrible.  Hardly seen the 1 waiter we had.  At one point we wanted to change seats due the family of the birthday girl came late and we thought we would want to sit with her sons.   The waiter happened to be in the room when we did it and basically yelled at us like we were 5 years old.  It was so unprofessional!    When he arrived with my food, it wasn't what I ordered so I asked for at least another type of sauce to put on it, never saw the sauce.  Never came back after that  to ask if we needed anything. I finally asked him for our bill and he was very rude. Told me he was getting it but it was difficult with so many people and all having separate bills. With the party of 20 gratuity was automatically added to our bill.  Our server didn't even deserve a tip.  If you plan on having a dinner party I would not recommend this establishment.  Horrible!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last night.
 I had a lots of fun there last night . The band was great ! The drinks were great ! The atmosphere was great! I would recommend it to others I will go again."}
{"text":"I have been a regular for years. Everyone here is great! The food is awesome,, The bar is beautiful and they are all nice and very professional. I recommend to many friends and they all leave happy! Try it-- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"From our entire family to your team - we want to say a heartfelt thank you for the kindness, hospitality, and generosity you showed us in our time of need. 

After my mothers passing, we chose Va Bene for a memorial dinner, and you handled it professionally, respectably, and delicately for us during a very emotional time. 

The food was unbelievable, the choice of wine (which we left up to you) was perfect, and the atmosphere was both warm and comforting. Thank you again for everything."}
{"text":"COME SEE RICK. HE IS OUTSTANDING! Wow. What a
Personality, can we bring him to Chicago!? He really is the grease to the wheels of this establishment.  He was recommended to come see by Anne from wild horse pass casino and resort.  Must stop in!! bands, amazing clean atmosphere and unbelievable drinks.  The calamari is so delicious a cooked to perfection, and I'm a calamari snob. Thank you yelp.   COME HERE!!!'FUN AND CLASSY."}
{"text":"Top marks for the service, very attentive and on the spot. Calamari was great and very enjoyable. The stuffed pork chop was a tad on the salty and dry side, no horrible but not top notch. Salmon was well presented and very good. Prices are good so definately well worth the meal, overall a good experience worth a return visit."}
{"text":"The place is very nice, staff is friendly and the food is decently priced.. we ordered chicken Marsala and rigatoni bolognese both were good.. can't wait to come back to try their other stuff"}
{"text":"The steak here blows the doors off any other steak house you may think is the best.   You have not had the best until you've had it here.  The service is always 5 star.  The portions and presentations are just right.  The desserts here are amazing. This place has a European flare;  cloth tablecloths and napkins.  It's a great place for a special occasion and always well prepared.  The cook may not match up the menu to what is in season entirely.  But it is always done right and never disappoints.  I have been here several times and always highly satisfied in every aspect and nothing left on my plate.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We ate here as a part of my conference. My Italian boss's wife chose the place. The service was fantastic and the calamari were huge. I enjoyed the veal piccata the veal was tender but a bit salty for me. The sang me happy birthday and brought me a dessert, it tasted fine but I don't eat sugar so not really my thing. 

I cannot say enough good about how the service was with almost 20 of us they did great a couple of mix ups on who got what but that's to be expected"}
{"text":"I met some girlfriends for Happy Hour on a Monday, which must be the least popular day for happy hour, as the place was completely empty. Appetizers were delish - prosciutto wrapped prawns, bruschetta and eggplant drenched in cheese and marinara sauce. The wine list was pricey and not that impressive of a selection. They don't have a cocktail menu, but have some specialty drinks that the bartender will tell you about if you ask. The ambiance was just ok for the prices. The bartender was really funny and full of great suggestions.  

This is NOT a place I would take my preschooler - the restaurant would not mind, but there's no kid food on the menu and there is nothing entertaining about the ambiance.

Apparently, this place is a wild dance club in disguise! The place turns into a dance floor on Friday and Saturday nights where the 70's, 80's and 90's music is pumpin. If you want to shake your thing in Ahwatukee, this seems to be the place. (I may just try it out and report back.)"}
{"text":"We had such a great experience at Va Bene tonight! The food was amazing (especially the Tarragon Muscles) and our bartender Shelley was excellent! I highly recommend trying Shelley's specialty drink, the Italian Lemon Martini!"}
{"text":"I have been here about five times for happy hour.   The happy hour is great because all the appetizers are half off.   The food is amazing!  I have only eaten in the bar so I am looking forward to having dinner here soon."}
{"text":"It's been some time since I've been in Va Bene. So I grabbed a Groupon and dropped in on a Sunday evening for dinner in the bar.  My first impression was pleasant; there wasn't a plethora of Cougars sitting around the bar ready to pounce. Ordered a bottle of wine and Michelle suggested a dish that wasn't on the menu that would pair well with the wine. It was fabulous!  Great dinner with fabulous service!"}
{"text":"Go to spot when I'm in town. I remember coming here when they first opened and have been in love ever since! Menu is authentic Italian and the staff is trained to know and ready to answer any questions. Aside from professionalism I always feel at home while here for you'll have the chef come out to ask how your meal is or the owner come by to say hi. Server Samantha, Dylan and bartender Brett always provide an amazing experience. Escargot, mussels, siciliana, gnocchi and espresso creme brûlée are must haves! Ask for a wine pairing and you'll never want to leave."}
{"text":"It was okay... We didn't had a reservation and planned to either sit in the bar or patio area. The patio area had a lot of smokers, so they told us we could sit in the front where it was non smoking... They hostess took us out front and it was completely unlit. She brought us a candle, which did nothing. We moved over to the other side of the patio which had a little more light. The patio seats' webbing was broken. We had to switch them with other tables on our own. I later saw other customers also finding broken seats at their tables. 

Our waitress was friendly. The food was decent, but not fantastic.  I had the ahi tuna. It was unmemorable.  My friend had the pollo alla pizzaiola which was tasty. But overall, not worth the price.."}
{"text":"Service was good but food was just ok, nothing to write home about. They do have live music on Saturday night but unfortunately we didn't care for the band we heard the night we went. The restaurant itself is very nice inside though"}
{"text":"No thanks not going here again... Me and my girlfriend used to love coming here that is until last night totally ruined that for us. My dad was visiting from out of town and we were telling him we had to take him here so we get there at around 9:15 their hours says 10 o'clock they close ok so working in the business myself I think 45 minutes is a reasonable time that your not being a dick and coming in right before their about to close. So the pros food is always good. The owner who actually took care of us for most of our time there was very nice and helpful as well as a server there Daniel is very good and friendly. We are there for about 5 minutes just got our drinks when the bartender comes over and says \"do you guys know what you want the kitchens waiting on you I think they're trying to get out of here\" ........ I consider us very easy going customers but I have never felt so uncomfortable out to eat in my life.. Even if that's the case don't EVER say that to a paying customer that's just a huge no no. And as I said it wasn't like we came in right before they were closing they were open for another 45 minutes!! My dad even said something about it to us and he's been in the business his whole life and is as easy going as it kids. It was just a very uncomfortable feeling and it made the dinner very awkward the rest of the time we felt rushed and tried to eat as fast as possible as we felt like a burden being there. Also when the food runner brought out the dishes my girlfriend asked if she could have some pepper on her pasta dish. Very reasonable request very common the food runner was nice about it and obliged he comes back to the table with red crushed pepper she had wanted the ground black pepper. Easy mistake obviously so problem but the food runners reaction was just the icing on the cake to the whole meal he gave her this disgusted look and rolled his eyes I couldn't believe it. I thought at first I was the only one who saw it but then when he walked away my girlfriend said something about it too. We were very disappointed like I said food is always great here and reasonably priced and any service we've had hear from Daniel and another couple people that work in the bar area it has always been great but this time was enough to make us never go back. The lack of professionalism was amazing to me especially at a place of that caliber. Very sad because we enjoy the food maybe we will get takeout but probably won't be back. Oh and I had the stuffed pork on the menu 18.95 when we get the bill 22.95??? I could care less about the money I still would've got it if it said 22.95 on the menu but that's definitely illegal charging different prices then what's on the menu.. Very odd and disappointing"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The chicken and mushroom alfredo is amazing. We started with the muscles in sausage and peppers and finished the meal off with a homemade tiramisu. Everything was fantastic and the service was excellent. 

We will definitely be back. One of my favorite Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"When I see escargot on a menu, I never pass it up!!!  Escargot Sautéed with garlic and a creamy gorgonzola cheese baked in a puff pastry with a spicy mustard sauce....YUM!  Wow. Enjoyed it so much. There also was a drizzle of a sweet strawberryish sauce in the sides of the plate. Oh so nice. A gentle blend of flavors that simply melted in my mouth!  Puff pastry was a tad undercooked, but only a tad. It was too good...I want to go back and have more. 

I was debating on veal Marsala or the stuffed pork chop with prosciutto. The waiter suggest a non-menu item: veal parmigiana. So I went with that. Never had it like this. I did wish I ordered the Marsala. That being said it was very good. Tomato sauce was so fresh. I did like the leaves of fresh basil I could mix in with the meal. Made a huge difference. The thinly prepared veal was sitting on a bed of spaghetti flat noodles.  A nice portion. The veal...each bite, every single one, tasted tender and had a mellow flavor. (I do. It think they were breaded). What I am trying to say is that each bite tasted identical. Yes!  Each bite was equally tender. Each piece of meat was wonderfully prepared before cooking.   

Service was friendly and service was done in a timely manner. I had forgotten what cheese was in the escargot, before it arrived and asked the waiter. He did not know. That surprised me a bit.   

Someone did order the stuffed pork chop. Came sliced resting in a clear mushroom sauce. He said it was a little dry but tasty and the sauce was not as flavorful as he would have liked. Overall...he liked it!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Italian food. Make a reservation if you know you are going. They like to act like sticklers about reservations. Ambiance is is a bit like modern Italian. Prices are reasonable for how good the food is. Fettuccine de pollo and fungi is very good. As is their meat sauce."}
{"text":"Food was okay server kept coughing. Kept waters filled. Chef did an okay job with fettuccini with chicken and mushrooms needed some spice maybe a touch of rosemary. For a martini bar there dirty martinis are not very dirty. I would probably not go back."}
{"text":"Dropping them a star for my last experience. Bartender could not have been less interested. No excuse when there are only 2 couples in the entire restaurant at 5 on a Monday!

I won't be coming here when Michelle is working the bar anymore. The experience of sitting at a bar and enjoying some drinks and food is meant to be shared. She would drop off a drink and run to the other side of the bar. No type of personal connection. With Randy its the complete opposite. The owners should take heed of this."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to eating here. Reviews pretty good. The service and atmosphere were very nice. It's just that the food lacked in flavor. Had to add salt which we hated doing. Will not return."}
{"text":"We went the day before Valentine's Day. Sadly, they were out of veal that evening so I ordered the lamb. It was incredibly tender and tasty. We ordered the salmon as well and came away unimpressed by the overall taste. It was cooked properly but was missing something. We also shared a tiramisu for dessert which was average tasting. The wine selection was incredible and the glasses that it was served in were classy and artistic.
The atmosphere was very nice but the hostess was wearing jeans. We would have been more impressed if she had been wearing slacks. The background music in the restaurant area was perfect......Sinatra and Tony Bennett....nice."}
{"text":"I would give this place another 1/2 star if they had a better selection of wine. The food was great, the atmosphere was good, live music was a nice touch. The service was above average. The patio outside was great with misters, but people were smoking out there so that was a definite negative. Over all it was great and we will go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious. The food here was so tasty and the service was great. We came here around 9 PM on a Thursday and it was pretty empty which was fine. The three of us in my group ordered pasta, I got the rigatoni with meat sauce and it was perfect! I even tried my SO and friends food and it tasted delicious as well. This is a cute little hidden spot that looks like it's been here a while and has accumulated some bar regulars. I just wish they played Italian music throughout the restaurant to give it a more authentic feel. I would hear Taylor swift in the dining area but big band swing music in the bathroom. And the prices are kinda expensive too but overall I had a good experience!"}
{"text":"This place is very nice.  The atmosphere is dark and relaxing.  Goodfor a date or a night out. Food is delicious and reasonably priced.  The portions Jette are good size to.  You can just about split a pasta and salad.  Servers are also very friendly and attentive.  I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"I really wish Va Bene was closer.  The happy hour is amazing (try the eggplant dish!) with great specials on food and drinks.  I've had the vodka sauce pasta, and that was pretty tasty, but mainly I stick to the appetizers and drink specials.  Luckily, they have happy hour 5 days a week!  The crowd is a bit older and they have karaoke after happy hour.  If you're a 40something on the prowl, watch out!  Otherwise, come earlier, or sit in the dining room to avoid the cougars."}
{"text":"When we first arrived we went into the bar and were basically ignored. The hostess eventually brought some menus over. However, once our server came over from that point forward everything was great! We had the steamed clams which were delicious.  The gnocchi was some of the best I've ever had. Highly recommend. They have a great happy hour as well."}
{"text":"I live close to this place and every night it has a good amount of people hanging out on the patio where they have a fire pit and a wine bar. We happened to go on a very slow night for a nice italian restaurant/bar, because it was the same night the NFL conference championships were playing. We tried the bacon wrapped shrimp (4 pieces of small shrimp) as an appetizer, and I was very disappointed by the overcooked, tasteless pieces of shrimp. I chose the \"special\" for the night, which was not very special. It was described by the waitress as a \"Prime Porterhouse\" steak, with brussell sprouts cooked with bacon and pecans as a side. The steak was definitely not as tender as prime beef should be, and it was a T-bone at best, NOT a porterhouse size portion as described. This mediocre dish was $38, which is more expensive than anything on the regular menu. Being that it was a \"special\", I did not think to ask the price before ordering. The only good thing about this place was the stiff drinks that our waitress poured. Other than that, I probably wont have any reason to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice place to enjoy a quiet dinner. Since we not from the area we took a chance based on the Yelp reviews and I'm happy to repetitious that Va Bene is a winner. The dimly lit interior sets the mood. The wine list has some nice choices across the price ranges and the menu has the standard as well as some unique dishes. We started with a glass of Pinot Grigio to accompany the Mussels with Sausage. The light red sauce was tasty and this interesting combination was great. We each had a salad next. Both the Caesar and Mediterranean salads were good. Fresh veggies and decent dressing. We ordered a Chianti to accompany the Mains. Chicken W/ Asparagus in. Lemon sauce with fresh mashed potatoes and Broccoli was excellent. Tender chicken and veggies cooled to perfection. The Rotini w/ Eggplant was also wonderful. Cubes of eggplant in a rich fresh tomato sauce."}
{"text":"This restaurants food, decor and service was outstanding! It had a great romantic atmosphere, perfect for my boyfriends bday dinner tonight! The food was delicious, from appetizers all the way to their fabulous tiramisu! (We even took a second piece home!) I had the risotto while my boyfriend had the pesto pasta and they were both just fantastic! All staff members were very nice and attentive!  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We had read several reviews of VB on Yelp that were less than stunning, but we have been trying to find a good Italian restaurant, so we wanted to try it and we had a very enjoyable evening.

Our server, Boris, was knowledgeable, efficient and had some good suggestions. (For example, my wife ordered the veal piccata and he suggested fettuccini as an accompaniment instead of the mashed potatoes that it comes with.) 

The food was excellent, as I said above, my wife had the vela piccata and I ordered the linguini vignole.  Each was well prepared and the pasta with each was al dente.

The wine selection is extensive and offered a good variety.

Overall, we had a great time."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 9pm on a weekday. We walked in before 9 and there was no one to seat us. We waited for a bit thinking that they would notice we were there. After about 10 minutes.. I walk towards the bar and THEN someone came to get us a table. It was quite dark in the dining room and the food was way over priced for the \"Olive Garden\" taste. The only reason for the two stars is the waiters service was not bad and the food was edible."}
{"text":"Very intimate setting. Very reasonable prices. Had the Lemmon chicken with asparagus..was delicious! Will return"}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour one evening.. 4 stars? Of course we have to check it out..

They have happy hour from 4-7. For food we ordered the Bruschetta, and the Melanzane Ripieni. The bruschetta was ok. It was just mainly tomatoes on it. I felt like a slice of cheese with it would've been perfect. It was no meat friday again so these items were perfect. The Melanzane was good. It's baked and filled with eggplant, cheese, zucchini, etc. I felt they could use some more items on their appetizer menu. It's mainly all seafood. Mussels, calamari, scallops etc. 

For the drinks... I was kind of shocked that they don't have a drink menu. They don't have a regular drink menu, wine menu, or anything. You basically tell them what you want and that's it. The first time, I ordered a Strawberry Martini while my friend got a Cosmo. Then we told our waitress, can you just have the bartender mix up a fruity martini. I'm not sure what was in it, but it was really good! The good news is their martinis are really good and they're a steal! $4! 

I would really recommend having a drink menu though, maybe throwing some specialty drinks on it along with a wine list and perhaps expanding the happy hour menu with the appetizers. I'd come back for a martini though for a price like that! =)"}
{"text":"Escargot heaven!  Had to order a second round-it was that good! Risotto Mare Monte was to die for!"}
{"text":"Great place to visit.  Found it on yelp.  They kept the kitchen open for our group of 5 and gave us a custom chef made meal. Grouper is awsome. Service was top notch"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! Great Service. The calamari is excellent. I have never had a bad meal or service at Va Bene. I always sit in the bar area. They have excellent wine selection."}
{"text":"This time I went in with just a white T-shirt.  Out of respect, I ask the host if the restaurant would serve me and I told her I will be glad to get dress for this place.  It was 118°F outside with record breaking heat in Phoenix so she said no problem.  Asked for a seat and enjoying my appetizer while I waited for my partner.   The dinner was nice and server were attentive but the bussers were less than friendly initially.  Smart wait staff would sale like I did but I saw none of that.  Since I knew exactly what I wanted and got what I need, it was a decent experience."}
{"text":"Great place for a date night. The salads are amazing!!!! Sweet glazed pecans and fresh vinaigrettes make their salads stand out from the rest. I always enjoy the Risotto it is always cooked to perfection!!! The margarita pizza is another fav. 
 The happy hour specials are great as well if you happen to go during the hours of 4-7pm.

An added bonus is the live jazz band that plays and sings in the bar area. (During certain times)"}
{"text":"The food was great and the prices were very reasonable. The restaurant is gorgeous inside and out and the environment was peaceful. Usually when I get large portions I worry about food qaulity, but in this case, I was served a large portion of great quality food."}
{"text":"Quite satisfied! My wife and I were looking for a new date-night spot and came across this joint on Yelp. We checked it out and we're impressed with the atmosphere, the service, the food, and the prices. Happy hour deals are great (ex: half-off appetizers and $1 off wine) and the food was terrific. We sat in the bar area and shared the beer-battered calamari (which was delicious!) and enjoyed the fettuccine with cream sauce pasta dish for our main course. The service was also fine--nothing too great, but kept our drinks full. Overall, a nice evening. We would definitely try it again when we're in that area."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for the 2nd time. ordered a cosmo YUM. The bartender was awesome.   The mood in the restaurant is very dark and the bar is impressive. 

The bread was fresh out of the oven and the perfect mix of doughy and crispy

Got the eat and cheese platter. I would recommend it. 

I ordered penne with the meat sauce and my boyfriend got the curry linguine wit shrimp. Mine was war better - the meat sauce is delicious. The curry linguine left much to be desired.

Overall, friendly, attentive, pretty good food. Will be back when I have a craving for some pasta."}
{"text":"This is a delightful restaurant with cozy ambiance. The menu is typical Italian and all our choices were excellent. We especially liked the sausage rigatoni and the seafood bisque. We had very attentive servers and thoroughly enjoyed our evening."}
{"text":"Omg everything was delicious and authentic. Lunch: Apple walnut salad and clams are a must, espresso brule is to die for. Beautiful dining area. Very intimate, definitely good for date night."}
{"text":"Good food and very nice bartenders ( Roberto and Rick) but the band  left a lot to be desired. Hurt your ears if you're into music."}
{"text":"We had the prime rib and the stuffed pork. Both were delicious!  Prime rib was perfectly cooked. Sauce was just right. The stuffed pork was yummy as well. Wine and beer selections are great too. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food from this little place tucked away in a strip mall in Ahwatukee. We had a lovely lunch with friendly, helpful service. Starters were fantastic - full flavored vegetables including eggplant and zucchini, and some tomato bruschetta. I've had better bruschetta but this stuff seemed to work. Our party of six enjoyed a few different pasta dishes, mine was a great olive oil, tomato, and garlic delight. I'd definitely try this place again for dinner in the future."}
{"text":"Midway typing my review, I decided to read others.   Were we just lucky that night??   The food was excellent as was the service.  I thought the prices were reasonable except for the Grouper special at $32 which needed some type of sauce on it.  Would we ever return??  Absolutely!  Just wished it was closer to Gilbert"}
{"text":"Found them on Groupon so decided to give them a try. Went there on a Monday evening. Hostess wasn't welcoming or friendly when we arrived and it was the same when we left. The restaurant was empty so I'm not sure what the issue was with that. 

We were seated in the dining room which was nice and quiet. Our server was great. Friendly, upbeat, and knowledgeable about the food and wine menus. He made great meal suggestions and the service was fast. We ordered calamari to start and had the linguine vongole and the penne aglio olio peperoncino con broccoli.  The food was amazing and portion size was on point. We ate it ALL. I don't even know how we managed. It was so good, we just couldn't stop eating.  

There were only two things I would've changed about our visit. First, when our main dishes were brought out, they left our empty appetizer plate on the table (this wasn't our server). It would have been nice if it were cleared off after putting down the main course or even prior. It ended up sitting on our table for a little bit. When our server came back to check on us, he saw it and quickly cleared it off. Next, would be the hostess. They are the first and last interaction guests experience with the restaurant. I would think a little training would help in both cases. 

But overall, we enjoyed it and plan on returning again."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for our weekly Friday night out and we'll certainly be back. The food was excellent. PJ had one of the daily specials, orange roughy in asparagus sauce, and I had the rigatoni bolognese. The service was top notch and checked on us often throughout the evening making recommendations along the way.

As much as we like him, we could have done without the constant Frank Sinatra music. At least throw in a little Tony Bennett once in a while, guys. ;)

Overall relaxing atmosphere in the restaurant side. We didn't even know there was a bar until we took a detour to the restrooms on the way out and exited through the bar which, while quite noisy, couldn't be heard from the dining room.

The place is tucked away in a corner of a strip mall, not where I'd expect it to be at all considering the dining experience which was fancy without being intimidating AND without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for happy hour and dinner. If you're coming for happy hour on the weekend beware, the place gets very full and it can be a challenge to find a seat. I'm an Italian food fanatic and I must say they do a really solid job. Some things are a little different from back east but everything is tasty and well executed. The only negative about Va Bene is sometimes the service is a little slow. It's like after all of this time in business they don't know when to expect a crowd... really? Don't get me worng, it's never been so slow that I wanted to leave or anything, it's just that it shouldn't take that long to pour a glass of wine. Oh by the way, the Calamari is really good, lightly battered and cooked properly -- try it."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere. The Calamari and Caprese were delicious! The service was fantastic!  The best part of the evening was the company and the staff was gracious about letting us enjoy our time together.  Memorable evening with fantastic friends and great food. Manga!"}
{"text":"Visiting this area. First time here. Birthday celebration. Our server Boris was amazing. Great food and wine recommendations. There were seven of us including two children. Everyone was pleased with their entree choice. Calamari appetizer was one of the best I have ever had. Desserts were great."}
{"text":"We called ahead to ensure they were serving linguini with white clam sauce, mainly because my stepfather was craving it for about a month and a half.  We were assured they were.  I convinced my parents to come to Ahwatukee to dine at Va Bene instead of going to the West Valley because, well, you know I don't go West of 7th Avenue except in extreme circumstances.  

We arrived and found Va Bene's dining room to be extremely dark.  I am all for ambience, but when I am eating I like to have a little bit more light so I can appreciate the plating of the dish.  

We were seated in the dining room to the right of the host stand, which was nearly empty at 5:30 on a Saturday, but started to get a few tables by 6ish.

We ordered several appetizers, chianti and sangria for the table and five entrees, including two orders of linguini with white clam sauce.

As our appetizers were delivered, we were informed that the chef did not think the clams were any good.  If we were told this when placing the order (or when the order was put in), we would have chosen to go to another restaurant.  At this point, we were stuck having to order something else.  There was another seafood dish offered as a replacement, but it was a few dollars more per dish.  We went ahead and ordered it since we had no other real choice, but to stay.  Of course, we were glad to not be served bad clams!

The appetizers were hit or miss.  
The calamari was EXTREMELY chewy.  My daughter could not bite through them at all.  I had difficulty chewing through the rings and chose the tentacles instead.  The Melanzane Ripiene was delicious, but it was a very small portion.  I don't eat Carpaccio, but my mom said it was pretty good.  The bruschetta was average.

The linguini frutti di mare was also average, even prepared with a white wine and garlic sauce.  The mussels were a bit chewy.  

For my entree I had Fettuccine with mushrooms and artichokes.  I love artichokes in everything, so this was a win for me.

My mother had the risotto.  She said it was \"just alright.\"  However, she ate a few bites and left the rest on her plate.  

My daughter was happy with a plate of spaghetti with butter and cheese.

At this price point, there are too many other better options for us to ever return.  We still had a nice time, but it was the company that saved the experience."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never written a review of this place. 

I think they have delicious food.  I wish their calamari were better.  But the other items I've had on the menu are tasty.  I had no idea they had a formal dining room or a private dining room.  I've ALWAYS only gone to the Lounge.  The atmosphere in the lounge is usually energetic and fun.  THere is an outside patio if you like sitting outside.

I have gone here on weekend nights to hear live soul music and to dance.  The crowd is a 30+ crowd and I personally love that, since I am 30+.  :-)  I have been for HH and for the later hours for the band.  I think they have great HH offerings from the appetizer menu and for the drink menu. 

The service here has ALWAYS been top flight and top class.  I've never been disappointed with the quality of service here.  My only complaint about this establishment is that it is in Ahwatukee and not in a more central location."}
