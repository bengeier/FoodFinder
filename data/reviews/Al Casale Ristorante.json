{"text":"Decided to take a trek up to this place last night with the boyfriend.  We drove up Leslie and its actually quite a nice drive when you get past Richmond Hill - it reminded me of a drive in the country - winding tree sided roads

Al Casale is a 200 year old farmhouse that was converted into a restaurant.  I always like house conversions.  Eating in little rooms makes it warm, cozy and intimate.

We started out with calamari which was done nicely - very lightly fried and fresh with a nice dipping sauce.  I had the fettucini with chicken and sun dried tomato.  Very nice.  My bf had the Linguine Di Mare.  I tried it and the sauce was really good - not too oily and the seafood was really fresh.  We had wanted the as advertised 'famous' tiramisu but sadly, they ran out by the time we ordered (people in the subburbs eat dinner earlier I guess).  The cheap $6 glasses of decent house wine made up for it though!

I'd recommend anyone who has parents in the northern subburbs and are visiting, or if you happen to live in the northern subburbs, to take the time to try this place.  It was a nice, pleasant meal and it was almost like a mini get-away.  Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! It was recommended to us by one of my wife's colleagues who had been here and loved it. So we decided to head there for our 4 year anniversary. Easy drive up Leslie from Aurora. 

We walked inside this cozy, quaint, very tidy environment through one of the many small rooms. It wasn't too busy which was not surprising considering it was a Thursday evening. We had a bottle of wine and some of their very fresh bread to start. For dinner my wife had their Caprese salad to start, the gnocchi for main, and the tartufo for dessert. I had their grilled calamari to start, veal parmigiana for main, and crime brûlée for dessert. All food was very fresh, savoury, and well prepared. My wife still claims that it was the best gnocchi she's ever tried, and considering the amount that she's tried I take this to be very true. 

The service we received was above and beyond what we expected. We were given an interesting story on the heritage and history of this 200+ year old house. Also, our desserts were brought out with lit candles to celebrate our anniversary and the server even sang us the Happy Anniversary song.

Overall, we had an excellent experience and we would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a special place to celebrate that special something."}
{"text":"Al casale's serves very well made dishes. I wouldnt reccomend going on day like valetines though (they cook few options in large quantities.) however i have never been dissapointed here. Wonderful pastas, great apps and a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"For my 70th Birthday, my mother-in-law and wife took me to this ristorante. We had very attentive service and they were to able to accommodate all of our varied requests for changes to their menu items.
My beef tenderloin was cooked perfectly, my wife's pasta dish was extremely tasty and my mother-in-law surprised everyone by finishing both the chicken Parmesan and the apple crisp dessert. My wife and I enjoyed the tiramisu for our dessert. 
The total bill with wine and dessert and  tip was under $60 per person which was very reasonable for the quality and the service. 
This is one place I can recommend with no hesitation."}
{"text":"I've been going there a few times a year since they opened.
There must be new owners!
The experience today was not the best.
The steak was tough and overdone.
The sides seemed to have come from a McCain's bag and were tasteless.
They seem understaffed and the service was slow - 3hrs for lunch?
I was surprised to see one of the servers sit down for their own lunch while we were still waiting for dessert and coffee to be served. 

Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great spot to eat! Went for my anniversary with my wife, the staff was incredible! It was incredible how approachable and friendly the staff was. The food was insanely good as well great portions made to perfection. Ensure you try this place, must eat place in Newmarket."}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday supper. The atmosphere was perfect...cozy with no hustle and bustle of a busy chain restaurant. We started with the grilled calamari...perfection!  The seafood risotto was also incredible. I have food allergies and the staff was able to meet my needs without making me feel like I was an inconvenience. I am looking forward to coming here again."}
