{"text":"oh my gawd.. I love the robo duck truck. such amazing and tasty treats! be sure and try the taco nauts!! yummm! definitely coming back for more! #taconaut @vegaslife"}
{"text":"If you see this truck at a food festival or something, stop and get the taco-naut. If you really like sushi, you'll like it as much as I do. It's definitly a texture changer when it comes to sushi. I think I have only had taht but its enough to make me stop and get it as an appirizer."}
{"text":"Looking at their menu the rawwrrr sounded good. There was no line so the food was ready in a timely manner. The sandwhich had Thai style chicken with a sweet chili sauce and components similar to daikon. The bread itself was suppose to be toasted but was very soft. Not a big deal but a crispy baguette would have definitely made a difference. The Jalapeño fries were just meh. The tasted like regular fries with a few jalapeños on top, there was no hint of ranch seasoning but they made have helped. I want to try more from this truck, maybe next month at first Friday"}

Formerly the Flying Monkey Truck, the Robo Duck Truck has the same fusion menu and font/color design. I'm pretty sure it has the same menu too. When I saw them at the Sunset Park'd food truck festival today, I knew I had to get the Taco-nauts again.

The Taco-nauts ($5) are four pieces of crispy wonton, each topped with a bed of sushi rice, a chunk of grilled miso salmon, and a drizzle of spicy mayo and eel sauce. I thought the food came out a little cold, but the flavor was still as good as I remember it from last time. This is a great appetizer and a treat to share between friends, so if you see them at a food truck gathering, stop here first.

Perhaps I'll finally try another of their offerings next time. Kurobuta udon sounds nice because kurobuta is always a treat."}
