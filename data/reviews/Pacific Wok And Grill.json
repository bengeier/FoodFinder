{"text":"Not often do I feel sorry for a restaurant owner because every time that I go to the Woodside Square food court, this place is deserted.

I can only speculate that the high school students across the street must eat here and that is why this place is still here.

On this occasion, I was in the mood for chicken pad Thai, which was on the menu. It seemed reasonably priced at $5.99.

While I was waiting my wife came and we both noticed that the food on the hot table had been there some time and didn't look appetizing. So, she asked about getting some fresh orange chicken which was on the board but not on the hot table. She was rejected, they wouldn't make it for her. She left in a huff.

As I was paying for my meal, I noticed that he charged me $1 when the sign said 99 cents, kind of misleading, but because it was only a penny, I let it slide but my eyebrow lifted.

When I got my meal, I opened it to what looked like chicken rice noodles, so I brought it back because it wasn't pad Thai. I complained. We argued about it.

I took it back, had a bite and realized it was beef! Not what I ordered, so I took it back and complained and we argued more about it.

No satisfactory solution was made.

So, I ate what they served me. It was not chicken pad Thai. In fact, the vinegar that they put in the dish made it repulsive and not good to eat. 

So, I will not be eating there again, EVER!

This is my warning to you...STAY AWAY, you eat here at your own peril.

This review is not funny because, there was no silver lining to this meal. I gave them a 1 on this review, because I could not give them anything less like a 0 or possibly more accurately a negative number.

So, you can't cook, you improvise, your food is stale, your argue with your customers, don't give us what we order, why are you still in business?

Goodbye forever, I will not miss you or feel sorry for you."}

{"text":"Ate here with a friend. He ordered a two meat combo with rice noodles and I ordered beef fried rice noodles but the owner was persistent that i get the shanghai noodles instead. I had to repeatedly insist for beef rice noodles before he accepted my order.

When my friend opened his takeout box, he was given cold leftover shanghai noodles instead of the rice noodles he had asked for. The meats were cold too. 

When my fried beef rice noodle came, there was no freakin beef in it.

How do you run a business by giving your customers the leftovers that they did not ask for? what pissed me off most was that he tried to get me to order what my friend did knowing that it was going in the garbage soon.

Pls don't eat here."}
