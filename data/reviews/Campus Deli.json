{"text":"I absolutely love everything that the Campus Deli has to offer. It's super convenient and quick. They deliver and you can even order online. I recommend the Philly Cheesesteak which is amazing and my go to item on the menu! Also, the menu is super fun and completely college oriented."}
{"text":"These guys are awesome! Food is always delivered quickly, piping hot, and fresh! Only complaint is that I ordered ranch with the loaded fries a couple of times now, and it always gets left out. No biggie. Check them out on grubhub if you don't feel like leaving the house!"}
{"text":"Staff was rude and disrespectful. The food tasted like it was cooked from a frozen conglomeration of mystery meat. But I simply can't get over the inexperience on the grill. It's almost like they sacrificed talent for convince. Their manager Joel (?) is really nice but the rest of the staff couldn't give a crap less about the business."}
{"text":"Definitely the best sandwich shop/lunch stop in Oakland. Very delicious and reasonably priced! The buffalo chicken wrap is amazing! Perfect amount of spice and flavor! Highly recommend Campus Deli!!"}
{"text":"I've had campus deli many times and it tastes great IF YOU GO PICK IT UP. Ordered food and got it an hour and twenty minutes later. And I had already paid the tip online, the food was cold and the delivery guy was rude. I am livid."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about Campus Deli and I was excited to try them when I was visiting Oakland. I placed an order for delivery: 2 sandwiches and 1 order of fries. The order was 2 hours late and ice cold. When the order arrived the delivery girl sat in her car and texted me to come out and get it. 

Be sure to have your oven ready for reheating your food when it arrives. Also, make sure to order a pizza to snack on while you wait -- (like we did)."}
{"text":"One of the most incompetent places I've ever seen. They wrote my address AND phone number wrong. After an hour and 40 minutes I had to call them to ask where my order was only to be told about how they called the wrong number and never got an answer. To top it all off, they offered to send the food, the SAME food that was sent out before and they only offered to reheat it and not even make new ones. Really bad service. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"definitely an old school deli. has  that feel. all their sandwiches (even a decent Philly cheese steak and im from the Philly area)  with names of sandwiches like the frat guy, the professor, the freshman, etc. this plays well into the college town vibe. good prices. with a beer distributor next door grab a few cold ones and get food and you got a good meal 

prices are really good too. everything is less than 8 bucks roughly, and you can walk in with a ten spot and get a good quantity of food. they don't short your on that here."}
{"text":"Want your order to be late every time? 2/2 orders, both over an hour late. College kids that have no concept of time management. Participation trophies breed this incompetency. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Awesome spot near campus for a tasty sandwich. Highly recommend this if you're hungover and need to get back on the horse. Prices are a little steep but the guys who work here are cool and will make your order fast."}
{"text":"Tasty sandwiches. South Oakland sub spot with lunch hours. Tasty and lots of meat. The price is super steep but the service is friendly and fast. I'd actually rank them above a Jimmy Johns or Papa DaVinci's in taste, which threw me off. 3.5 stars....subs too small overall for the price but taste is solid."}
{"text":"I live down the street from this place and wish for nothing more than for it to be better.  I was excited to hear the items on the menu.  I am a sucker for a sandwich with lots of abstract foods on them.  I have tried The Student and The Professor on multiple occasions.  Every time I just wish they had a different sauce on them and more of it.  The sandwiches are dry and lacking in flavor.  If you ask them to put more sauce on (which I did after the first time), they charge you extra.  I dig the creativity but it is lacking in everything else.  

The wait is also ridiculous.  It takes almost 20 mins each time I've been there for them to make the sandwich even if there's no one else there.  Not to mention the people who work there are rude."}
{"text":"Good Philly Cheesesteaks can be tough to find. Especially in Pittsburgh. I'm glad to have stumbled across Campus Deli - by far, they serve the best cheesesteak around.

Admittedly, in this city, that's not exactly saying much. But that's alright. I'll be stopping here again in the future.

On another note, the bacon cheese fries are excellent. Though they probably took a few years off my life, and my arteries are probably still upset with me, I can't deny that I loved them. Crisp, consistent, and no grease. It almost makes the trade-off worth it."}
{"text":"I have walked/driven past Campus Deli too many times to count and based upon appearances I was never willing to venture inside. A friend had always claimed that they make some of the best subs he had eaten. The combination of his gleaming reviews and their newly redesigned deli finally drew me inside and I was not disappointed.

They use Boar's Head meat, quality cheeses, and THE BEST sub buns around (perfectly chewy). I ordered \"The Sophomore\", capicola, prosciutto, salami, ham, provolone, sun dried tomatoes, lettuce and vinaigrette. It rocked! Inside is a wall describing their 20-30 sandwiches, all of which sound delicious and are priced between $5-8. Based on the quality of the ingredients, the taste, and the price, I can't think of a single reason to go to Subway or Quizno's."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a long time.  I should have waited a bit longer I suppose.  The experience I had was not stellar at all.

I opted for the breaded chicken salad after contemplating several other items on the menu.  I should have stuck to a sandwich from here.  When the salad arrived, the dressing was missing.  A very important key ingredient to any salad is the dressing.  With me being at work and on a limited amount of time to consume my salad on my lunch break, I had to rummage through the work fridge for some type of salad dressing to top this off.

From the description on the menu you are to receive a handful of fries along with all the other ingredients for this salad.  If they consider this a handful of fries, I consider that they have a two year old working there.  I counted, and there were no more than eight total fries on this salad.  The breaded chicken was actually good.  It appears that they may make it on site (I cannot confirm this), but is was lightly breaded.  Not like the chicken tenders at most other restaurants.  Easily the best part of the salad.

One other shining star to this salad was that they give you a pita on the side instead of bread.  Giving you the option of putting the salad in the pocket and eating while doing other tasks.  But it wasn't shining enough to give this place more than two stars in my opinion."}
{"text":"You'll be hard pressed to find a better sandwich in Oakland, especially one better than the Buffalo Chicken Cheese Steak .  Great hot or cold sandwiches and tons of options to choose from.  A little pricey but well worth spending those hard earned pennies on.  Oh yeah....they're open late night on the weekend and deliver as well."}
{"text":"Chicken Parm was good. The Professor was interesting, but still good. For the price and convenience, not a bad stop"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but do not order from here unless you want your food to be totally wrong when it's delievered. This has happened to me 5 out of the 8 times I have order from here within the year.

Probably won't order from here again."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Oakland. All of their specialty sandwiches are perfect hangover cures. If you're going to get campus deli, get a sandwich. Their salads aren't very good at all, but are salads ever really that good? The sandwiches are all around $9, but for me they last two or more meals. DELICIOUS. LOVE THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"The Deli reeks with scent of variety. Lots of sandwich/wrap choices. Expect to pay $10 for a sando that may still leave you hungry but will usually be tasty. Lived off this joint for a year, but it was only because I lived across the street. Recommend the jalepe√±o poppers or the buffalo chicken wrap.

3/5 clams - TV"}
{"text":"I'm confused why this only has 3 starts? We order delivery from them at least once a week and everything is amazing. The chicken strips and fries are a favorite go to, the chicken wraps ate always great and the themed sandwiches are amazing! I just wished there fries were bigger since they are almost $5."}
{"text":"I lived beside of Campus Deli last summer, so needless to say, we ended up there pretty frequently. The food is alright if you go during the day, but the quality of your order relies entirely on when you ordered it. Free delivery? Great, but expect soggy food."}
{"text":"A convenient local deli which quickly serves up both hot and cold sandwiches. It's open late."}
{"text":"Good place to go to if you want to pick up a sandwich. We went around opening time and there was already a short line but honestly not that bad. There are a bunch of different sandwiches to order from, and we decided to get the Buffalo Chicken Philly Cheesesteak and a regular cheesesteak. We got the fries and onion rings. You get a good amount of fries but for whatever reason there aren't a lot of onion rings. They were well made but it was unfortunate there weren't that many that came with it. The regular cheesesteak is good except it's a little dry. 

I would probably come again though I did think the sandwiches were a little bit on the pricier side."}
{"text":"Usually these guys have good food, but NEVER ordering again! THEY DO NOT CLEAN FRYING OIL/GREASE. Do not order any fried food from this place. I got mozorella sticks here the other day, and they smelled so bad. Sadly I actually ate one and the after taste was in my mouth for days! Grossest experience I've ever had. I used to be a regular but will forever warn people of this establishment. Truly dissappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of them for years.  Great place for a good lunch, they still deliver to me all the way in Regent Sq.  Just a great place to get a good sandwich."}
