{"text":"just perfect! I had a pears tart and an apple muffin. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"So good I'm writing my first ever Yelp review!

I stumbled upon this spot after a somewhat disappointing visit to Saint-Viateur Bagel just a few doors down (apparently I should have waited for a fresh batch of sesame bagels), and ended up having THE BEST berry tarte of my life.

The chef/owner is super delightful and loaded me up with lots a goodies to take home after I told him how sorry I was to have discovered his shop on my last day in Montreal.  The berry tarte is still my favorite, but the mango and raspberry sorbets, brioche, eclairs, and chocolate croissants were all superb.  I also really enjoyed a thyme-seasoned croissant, which I ate with cheese and fresh tomato as the chef recommended -perfect for an afternoon picnic.

I highly recommend this spot - I'll definitely be back here the next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Topnotch quality, one of the best pastry shops in the city.  We always order our special occasion cakes from here and have never been disappointed.  Always a hit with our guests. Not to be missed!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I spent a month trying a new cafe every day in Mile End, and then started coming here every day. The chef and his staff are so friendly and helpful. They speak both French and English. The croissants are the BEST I've had in Montreal and only $1!! The chocolate croissants (called choclatine) are my absolute favorite. Husband loves the almondine, our son loves the fromage. All baked fresh every day. The pastries, cakes, and lunch items are also amazing. I love the fresh pizza, especially the bacon. The chicken curry lasagne is also amazing, and his seasonal soups are delicious! Also his fresh artisanal sorbets and gelato. The chocolate gelato and lemon sorbet are to die for, and he always gives my son an extra big scoop and lots of samples! Perfect and refreshing on a summer day. The chef is a native of Paris so you can be sure everything is authentic and fresh. He will welcome you here with open arms!"}
{"text":"Patisserie Chez de Gaulle is tastefully amazing . I would gladly recommend you to go there for your morning bread or to treat yourself with their wonderful pastries ! Bravo !"}
{"text":"Kind old looking pastry shop! The appearance isn't attractive, but we don't judge by its cover. 

The service is was very good. Our server was one the sweetest man. We were confused about the croissant, so our gentleman recommended chocolate/almond croissant. My mom was in heaven. Then we had cappuccinos; they were super good. 

It was a nice stop over."}
{"text":"Cette petite pâtisserie offre un service très sympathique et des produits délicieux. Les croissants au beurre sont à 1$ et ils surpassent vraiment ceux des autres boulangeries/cafés du coin."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood patisserie. Everything thing is fresh 7 days a week. We get our croissants here every week. Only $1 a croissant!  Chocolatines are great as are the chocolate, rum and almond pastries. Great place!!"}
{"text":"We were wondering and lured inside by the tastiness in the window.  

Despite having mostly spent the day eating ( OMG Montreal food! )  we couldn't walk by the treats in the window.   In my defence,  I'm weak and was on vacation and I'm sticking to that. 

It's always a bit risky because we were the only ones there and we hadn't checked yelp so I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of my random find.   It looks like a small family shop (the kids came home from school while we ate) and everything was very friendly.   The little chocolate cake I had was super delicious.   Not too big but pretty and epic decadence.  I'm sure this place is owned by a pastry chef with classical and likely european training.  

I would totally check out this place again for more sweet treats if I were in the area."}
{"text":"We love this place!  It's about a 10 minute walk from where we're staying this summer and we come almost everyday for delicious croissants, ice cream, breads, desserts, pizza and lasagna.  

We've become great friends with the Parisian chef and the staff.  Very friendly and kind. He actually taught my wife how to make croissants...which was a dream come true to be taught to bake by a French chef.  

My personal favorites are the chocolate Almond croissants (a bit heavy and very sweet, but thats perfect for me) and the curry lasagna. 

We had a custom fondant cake made for my son's birthday for less than $20 that he loved and was really good. 

The $1 crossiants are light and buttery and my wife loves the chocolatines. 

Nice comfortable atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick bite. Ordered a roast beef sandwich and a slice of pizza. Sandwich was good, pizza was very good. Very friendly and courteous staff. They have a large variety of pastries and cakes which seemed to b very popular. 

There is a nice area with outdoor seating to enjoy your food while people watching"}
{"text":"Small little pastry shop which has many sinful dessert items and some delicious looking pizza. Our stop here was for my daughter and she enjoyed a very nice cone of ice cream on a warm spring day. They had a very nice relaxing terrace (outdoor patio area) where we relaxed while my daughter enjoyed a nice requested smaller ice cream cone. 

Inside the shop is small and there is a nice selection of prepared pizza plus lots of very decadent desserts and French (from France desserts and eclairs). If you ate here regularly you may have to loosen the notch on your belt by one or two. A nice addition to the neighbourhood and the shops owners were gracious in acknowledging us and were pleasant. 

A great place to come if you are having company and need some quick desserts or if sweet food is your calling in life!"}
{"text":"We went twice at this place. The first time we had breakfast: I had a cappuccino and a chocolatine and my boyfriend a croissant and a latte. The chocolatine was really disgusting, like dry, the croissant was without any particular taste. And we paid 17$ for this! But we gave them the second chance, we went to grab a coffee and a piece of cake. My hot chocolate was really awful, and my Saint honorè was really bad. My bf grabbed another sweet that wasn't really bad, but we paid 20$ and it's too much for 2 pastries and 2 boozes without nothing of special like those. 
Never again!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite pastry shop in Montreal. The desserts are true quality, delicious but not overly rich. The owner is so nice and helpful. A must try!!!"}
