{"text":"Pheeeeeenomenal Falafel! I consider myself something of a falafel connoisseur, and this hit all the bases for what I look for. Choice of pita (I got flax.. it was fresh and soft and chewy and perfect) tons of great toppings, and the most moist and flavourful patties you'll ever sink your teeth into.  I've been a yelp follower for a while, but using it for a heads-up of places to avoid and places to definitely visit, but after eating at Pita Break I almost ran home to sign up so I could review it and tell everyone how great it is.  GO GO GO!!  ps: really sweet falafel artists"}
{"text":"I would definitely not consider myself a Falafel connoisseur by any means, but I do enjoy them as a nice change from time to time.   The felafel's are great, but don't stand out on their own. It is combination of all the elements. The coriander sauce is delicious, mixed with the hummus and the other great toppings, and to top it off the pita is probably the best I've had. Always warm, soft, and never falls apart.  The service is always really friendly, and the cherry on top is they give you the top portion of the pita to nibble on while you anxiously await your tasty sandwich.  I definitely recommend this place be incorporated into your rotation."}
{"text":"not really a review but am so sorry that this restaurant is no longer there and another stupid shawarma place has opened in its place with terrible signage to boot"}
