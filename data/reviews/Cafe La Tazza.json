{"text":"Cafe La Tazza is a nice mix between a coffee shop, and a fine grocery. It was a real surprise for me when I went for the first time after a nice walk in Verdun. Coffees are excellent, and snacks seems to be delicious. On a hot day, you can enjoy a cold beverage as some Gelato.

The woman that was there was so pleasant, and was smiling all the time. She seems to be the owner, and she is definitely there to take care about her customers. If I had to say only one negative thing about this venue, is that it's too small, so they cannot have too many people at the same time. I think they have something like 6 tables.

If you are in Verdun, you really need to stop there, and enjoy a good moment with your preferred beverage in a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Nice that there is a specialty Italian goods shop in this part of town. You can find them in Saint Leonard, LaSalle and other spots on the island, but this is the only one I know of in Verdun. Does have a cute little sitting area to munch or sip on things. Watch for their hours, as I believe they are closed on Mondays, but again always good to check before you go, especially if coming from further away. Lots of gift options to be found if you happen to need. Ciao"}
