{"text":"Sometimes vegan food sounds good to me but this place is making me contemplate becoming a vegan great food all should try it"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at OSB a couple of weeks ago and were delighted with our meals. The atmosphere,  the friendliness of the staff, Gregory our host and even the chef were all welcoming. We felt as if we were family.  The only person who did not interact with the guests was Oliver,  though he was walking around.  Food was amazing and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Lots of Gluten Free options. Awesome dry soy capaccuini (not an easy task). I will become a frequent customer."}
{"text":"Coffee is phenomenal! Has late night hours and beer on tap. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Place was awesome me and my wife met are friends there who introduced us to it and the coffee, food, lemonade and customer service was amazing highly recommend layout was very retro and good corner location and parking just behind it."}
{"text":"The food was SO special...I had the Arizona Quinoa salad and shared a hummus with a friend...I cannot wait to go back next time and have a beer!  Loved the location!"}
{"text":"I've been perusing all the other reviews and it looks like everyone else had a pretty good experience. I wish I could say the same. My friend and I stopped in after the gym to grab a sandwich and a wrap to go. There were two tables occupied and the people at the tables were finished up with  their meals. When we ordered our food to when we got it, no other patrons walked in and no one else was served. We waited 27 minutes for one chicken salad wrap and a tuna melt.  I assume both salads are made in batches and could have been assembled quite quickly.  Even if not, that's a ridiculous amount of time.  If that's how long it takes for a sandwich and a wrap when the establishment is basically dead, I would hate to see how long anything takes to come out when you're busy.  Also, someone sitting at a computer that worked there told us where to find the bathroom key and when we told him how long we had waited, he told us they had been busier earlier. He could certainly tell they were dead from when we had arrived and should have went back to the kitchen to check on our food to see what the hold up was, which he did not.  I wanted to like this place so much!! Maybe it was just an off day.  The food was good, but with so many other options in downtown Phoenix with much better service I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great place and food.  I enjoy sitting on the patio with my dog, Missy.  I'll see you there."}
{"text":"I wandered into this place on a Monday afternoon. The space is bright and open and there are plenty of outlets to plug in devices. I got the Sweet Potato Bruschetta (not sure if that is the actual name) and a mint green tea. Both were really, really good! The staff was friendly and attentive.  I will definitely be back. A great place to work or hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Downtown to visit the art museum and after two hours of intellectually stimulating wandering we found ourselves ravenous. Yelped the area for vegetarian friendly spots and came across this gem. Newly opened & they are incredibly welcoming and friendly. A family operated spot with a modern layout and super diverse menu. (Most importantly, they're Vegetarian friendly.)   I had the chipotle wrap with the sweet spicy pickle. Amazing! Two portions worth, and the smoked gouda was spread through the whole wrap making every bite phenomenal!  Mom had wild salmon melt and it came as several little toast points which she assured me were perfectly seasoned and absolutely incredible.  Also notable was the homemade organic lemonade. It is out of this world!!  Local sourcing and herbs grown in restaurant show you their commitment to premium, fresh preparation.   A fantastic experience, will look forward to visiting again very soon!!"}
{"text":"My wife, son and I came here to meet friends from out of town. Breakfast was outstanding: I had eggs and cheese on arugula with pesto. Tasty and fresh: the mint on the fruit cup was picked from their indoor garden. The light drip coffee was perfectly roasted. Clean, friendly, terrific atmosphere for a Sunday morning. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you are a cold brew fan this is a MUST try place in Phoenix! Delicious coffee, great staff and a nice spacious place and design. Super excited this opened up in my neighborhood. I will be making this a regular place!"}
{"text":"Oliver's Sophisticated Bean is a welcome addition to RoRo. Great food and friendly staff, and a comfortable space, were all elements I appreciated during each of my visits to OSB this month. In addition to enjoying a few lunches here myself, we also recently hosted a private event at OSB. Oliver and his team couldn't have been more wonderful to work with throughout the planning and execution. They were completely accomodating and the food they served our guests all won rave reviews from everyone. And the special-order carrot cake that Juli, Oliver's mother, made for us was incredibly delicious and decorated artfully in keeping with our event theme. We are so grateful to Oliver and his great team for all they did that helped make our event a huge success. Thanks, Oliver, Juli, Bryan and the staff at OSB for everything."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great service, atmosphere, and food! Not too many customers when we arrived so we got a 5-star service but that's not to say you wouldn't receive a 5-star service if it were busy. In conclusion, I felt very welcomed and will definitely be coming back more often."}
{"text":"Excellent owner, great coffee and ice tea, and awesome Quinoa Salad. Nothing says more than compassion and great space to get some work done. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I happened to wander in here on a Sunday night. And little did we know that we stumbled on something amazing.  My friends both got coffee, which I sampled: cold brewed coffee (SOLID), and an iced vanilla latte (A+++), and I got their bacon breakfast burrito. The burrito took a little time, maybe 10-15 minutes (the guy taking my order also let me know it might take some time; and the heads up was appreciated), but it was absolutely worth the wait!  The guy and gal working behind the counter were both very nice, patient, and helpful. So the friendly staff definitely seals the deal on this. I don't always find myself in this area looking for coffee, but I will be back!"}
{"text":"I meant to post a review after my first visit... but then I went back four more times before I had a chance to write my review. The food is wonderful, the vibe is excellent, the drinks are fantastic. I am so happy that OSB is downtown and it fills a much needed space as a go-to coffee shop/breakfast/lunch/snack/easy hangout space. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I took my parents here for breakfast because of all the great reviews. This intersection has a lot of construction going on so just be prepared for that. I parked at the meter (which is to be expected in downtown) but I didn't see any nearby parking lots. The shop has windows all around which makes it feel very open. The decor is industrial (loved it) and they have plenty of seating inside.  I ordered a latte (no flavors added) and the rocky point wrap (if I'm not mistaken on the name but it was amazing!). The wrap had black beans, egg, avocado, cheese, and salsa; the flavor was perfect! I also tried my mom's yogurt bowl and that too was pretty amazing.  They're still fairly new and working out the kinks but this was a wonderful choice for breakfast. I do have a couple of suggestions :) - provide napkins (maybe next to sugar/water station) and keep an eye out on the food orders (ours sat for a few minutes while they were talking). Other than that, great place and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great to know that this place is open until midnight, especially when I need to tackle school work. I wasn't too fond of the iced vanilla latte but after hearing murmurs from other individuals and their love for their drink I will have to try something else."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Some of the best coffee I have had in the Phoenix area.  Only downside is that because it is in the center of Phoenix it is hard to find parking or you need to pay for parking but the coffee makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Great organic products, including fresh local milk-grass feed and uninterested with RBS-t. Almond milk and strong delicious coffee."}
{"text":"It was the cold brew that called my attention to this place. Crossing the threshold, my senses were overwhelmed by the spicy smells of chai and the planter to my left where fresh herbs are being grown indoors. It's amazing how scents can really penetrate the core of your being. I was greeted with a warm welcome and shared more than just small talk with the man working the counter (I later found out he was the manager) as he was genuinely interested in providing me an excellent experience here. The cold brew: refreshing, chocolatey. Perfect for the 100 degree Phoenician weather. My girlfriend tried the iced chai - the best I've had yet. We decided to sit at the bar and an inspirational conversation with the man seated next to us was stirred up. He shared his life experiences and musings that led him to opening this place. Oliver is a really cool guy with a positively encouraging perspective on life.  Try the sweet potato bruschetta. So simple, and yet I dare say it was life changing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Friendly staff, yummy, fresh food & good prices!! Try it out if your in the area!  I suggest the yogurt parfait!"}
{"text":"Talk about an awesome, beautiful eating spot...this is exceptional!!! The food is the freshest (some of it even grows inside the restaurant), and most delicious in downtown Phoenix! You must give them a try!!! Oliver, Julie, and Greg are also the must generous, kind people ever! I love your healthy food so much, only wish I lived closer!  God bless ya\"ll real good...with health, happiness, and prosperity."}
{"text":"We wandered in because I was looking for breakfast & I had driven by lots of times, but with all the construction in the area found it difficult to find a parking, thankfully, I found one. Not only were we greeted warmly, our server was friendly & seemed to genuinely like what he was doing. I find that so refreshing as working in the food industry can be overlooked. I find this kind of work is extremely difficult & have mad respect for those who choose to work in it. Now to the food... absolutely delicious. I had a breakfast bowl and my date had a burrito. The coffee was fresh & delicious. If you like strawberry lemonade definitely try theirs. It's made fresh to order and almost like a dessert. They serve wine & beer as well. The atmosphere is open, relaxing & can't wait till the weather cools, to be able to relax sit outside & enjoy more of their delicious food, which I am looking forward to. Only bad thing, as with most downtown areas, parking can be difficult at times.   Once construction is done I'm sure will get better."}
{"text":"Wow! What a coffee shop!   Along with this great downtown location and beautiful space, the food was delicious! A friend and I split the multi-cheese grilled cheese sandwich and Spring goat salad based on the recommendation of a friendly employee. Literally, we watched another employee pick salad greens from the in-house garden. Our meal was hearty, tasty, and just clean-living kind of food. I'm looking forward to trying the coffee and tea next time.  The employees were friendly and funny--including the owner, Oliver, and his parents, who came over to say hello after our meal!  Lastly, downtown parking was a pain, but don't get discouraged by the meters. There were free street parking spots located nearby, if you're ok with walking a short distance.  Summary of the highlights:  - opens early and closes at midnight! - plenty of accessible electrical outlets - good food and variety of drinks/milks - reasonable prices - free wifi  - student discounts  - comfortable chairs and tables - no overwhelming coffee smell or excessively loud music while you work"}
{"text":"I come here just about everyday for a meal. I'm health conscious and the food here is fresh organic all from local venders. I can tell by the taste. Everything is deliciously unique. The Quinoa AZ is one of my favorites. The fresh mangos, kale, nuts, black beans, tomatoes, corn and quinoa is the best superfood combo. I've also tried their veggie wraps, yogurt parfait bowls, and the smoking bacon burrito. There is something for everyone here if you're a meat eater, vegan, vegetarian, gluten free....  The coffee is exceptional! It is very smooth and full in body. They use local milk and also have plant based milks as well so all the espressos come out delicious. Also their green mint ice tea is so refreshing as well.  One of my favorites is their signature drink called the Aussie... It's gelato ice cream with espresso shots poured over it! Something I've never seen anywhere else.  All in all the atmosphere is wonderful. Great place to do homework or just come and hang out with friends. The staff is knowledgable and friendly and the owners are great people who you can tell truly put their heart into this place by making it so welcoming, healthy and delicious picking everything strategically to the cleanest and highest quality."}
{"text":"This place has the best tuna melt in the city! While the presentation of the sandwich is reminiscent of bite sized tuna cakes, it is indeed just a sandwich cut into perfect bitesized portions. Which in turn makes it less messy to eat. The flavor is wonderful, a blend of cheese, fresh herbs, capers, and tuna. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Great environment, great people and not to mention food was flavorful. Even got a little back story on Oliver and how this coffee shop came about. I had the vegan burrito and it was a must try ! Also the coffee was freshly brewed. Definitely coming back and bringing friends !"}
{"text":"The food and owners are great. Healthy options and a casual environment. Also, I came in last night but I forgot my wallet and the owner's dad was at the register and comped my meal. I returned tonight and there was a different person at the register and I told them I also wanted to pay for last night's meal. She told me not to worry about it, but I insisted. Point is: I didn't return just to pay for my comped meal. I returned because the food is great."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Was able to meet staff and all were very nice and welcoming. The owner seemed like a nice guy and was great to see that it was family owned and operated. Chef definitely takes pride in her work and puts out beautiful delicious food. Prices were all very reasonable and is a great place to hang out with some friends or sit on the couch to study and read."}
{"text":"I've been having a carby life lately, so when a friend said, \"Let's look for a salad place,\" I said, \"Yes, please.\" This was perfect. All I had was some delicious walnut & goat cheese salad made of very fresh butter lettuce, and all was well in the world."}
{"text":"Taste the difference with their high quality ingredients. The flavors are just right. I've been having issues of late with many of the restaurants downtown having over salted food. Not this place. The music was the perfect level to build a relaxed ambience yet still have a conversation.  I had the Rocky Point and it was delish. The chocolate pecan cookies for dessert were the perfect end for my meal and tied with the delicious coffee.  My new favorite breakfast/brunch place."}
{"text":"Terrific new place with great coffee and food. And open late! So happy they exist. Thanks for a lovely meal as we were heading out of town!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Vegan/Vegetarian Cafe' located in the Arts District of downtown Phoenix ! The vibe and the neighborhood mirrored downtown Las Vegas' Arts District, so I felt at home.    As soon as My gf and I walked inside, everyone greeted us hello with a smile . Very refreshing especially for being out-of-towners.  My gf and I opted to split breakfast, so we can grab some goodies later on from the Saturday's Farmers Market on Central .   We decided on the following :  The chipotle veggie wrap 5/5 Organic house lemonade 5/5 Black bean Organic Brownie 5/5 Ethiopian roast with almond milk 5/5  Probably one of the best lunches and hospitality we had in a very long time, you guys rock \m/"}
{"text":"Oliver's is a new addition to Roosevelt Row and has burst onto the scene quite impressively.  Prominently located right on Roosevelt on the bottom floor of the Roosevelt Point apartments on 3rd Street, Oliver's has the advantage of being very visible at the heart of Downtown Phoenix's trendiest neighborhood.  Can only imagine the crowds this place will get on First Fridays when the sidewalks are packed with humanity.  While coffee is Oliver's calling card, I wanted to check out the food (not being a coffee drinker and all).  I scoped out Oliver's menu online and figured I'd give them a whirl just after work on a Friday afternoon.  First thing I noticed stepping inside was how spacious the restaurant was.  It doesn't look like it from the street, but there's a fairly large amount of seating here.  I'd guess seating for about 40-50 inside with room for another 10 on their patio along 3rd Street.  The menu is prominently displayed behind the counter where you order and they bring it out.  For this go around, I ordered the Spinach Artichoke Grilled Cheese sandwich.  To boot I got a glass of their house made strawberry lemonade and a house made snickerdoodle.  Total cost including tax came to about $15.  They brought the snickerdoodle and lemonade out right away while I waited for my sandwich.  This is where Oliver's gets docked a star for me.  One of the cooks apologetically came out and said they had a massive lunch rush and barely had enough ingredients to make me half of my sandwich.  Really?  You're open late, but you run out of sandwich fixings halfway through the day?  Yikes.  To her credit, she apologized profusely and offered to serve either an entirely new item or half the sandwich I wanted plus half of anything else on the menu.  So I went with half the sandwich I ordered and half of their Chipotle Grilled Cheese.  About five minutes later, my two half grilled cheese sandwiches came with greens and they also threw in some of their vanilla almond protein bites for free.  I appreciate that they at least tried to make it right, but in the future, the Oliver's staff might want to do a better job of stocking up on ingredients so as to be able to serve the masses what they want all the way to closing.  Now then, let's talk about the food.  The strawberry lemonade was excellent.  Crisp, refreshing, and apparently organic.  Nice.  The greens were lightly drenched with a champagne vinaigrette and the snickerdoodle was surprisingly soft and light (not the crumbly sugar bomb you'd get at Paradise Bakery).  The protein bites, well, they tasted like cookie dough with vanilla and nuts.  Not bad, just unexpected.  As for the sandwiches?  The spinach artichoke grilled cheese was excellent.  Spinach, artichoke, cream cheese, chicken, and colby jack cheese on toasted bread.  Fresh ingredients, great bread, super tasty.  The chipotle grilled cheese includes gouda, arugula, and what I think was pecorino on a cheddar chipotle toasted bread.  Pretty tasty as well, though I was still partial to the spinach artichoke one.  So to recap, docking one star for not having enough inventory for the full sandwich I wanted, but there's still enough positives about Oliver's that I can recommend it.  The prices are reasonable, the ingredients are sourced locally (they show off their suppliers right up front), and many of their menu items are organic, vegetarian, or even vegan.  The location is great and an ideal gathering spot for local artists and downtown college students alike.  And per my experience, the staff was friendly and accommodating.  Nice addition to the neighborhood, provided their kitchen is fully stocked going forward."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place? Their food is always incredible and they have plenty of gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan options which is wonderful.   They locally source products from other small businesses which really says something. They dont just cut costs and do all their shopping at Costco like so many places do. Nothing wrong with Costco, but that doesn't support other local businesses or keep that money here in the valley.  The people who work there are amazing and super friendly. It's a small, locally-owned business. I always feel welcome and they're willing to make my customizations on my orders. Their breakfast burritos are bomb. I loved the lunch items I've tried also.   They have broad hours which is a major plus. A lot of things close early downtown so I can appreciate their extended hours."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast and got the farm house egg sandwich. Super tastey, definitely worth the $10 for all locally sourced products. Nice, clean dining and lounging area and I really appreciate that they grow their greens and herbs in house and clip them right in front of you! Overall, pretty good. Would come here again."}
{"text":"This is a family business that you WANT to give business to. I go out of my way on my commute in the morning to stop in for coconut iced coffee and a bite to eat. They have yummy cold brew, and they make all of their dishes and goodies in-house- with love and delicious ingredients!!!  If you don't know the back story on this place, I recommend you look into it as well. It'll draw you in even more than the breakfast. All my love!"}
{"text":"The food and service here are exceptional! They support locally grown products. The spinach and artichoke grilled cheese was amazing!!! I will frequent this new hidden gem. Local beers are on tap, as well. It's in a loft-style place with modern decor, exposed vents and repurposed wood."}
{"text":"Came in for a late dinner, pleasantly surprised!  Wife got the Spring Goat salad and I had the chicken salad on a croissant and added bacon.  Both were delicious.  The cold brew coffee was also quite good.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick cup of coffee before heading to the Barber Shop down the street. I was very impressed with this intimate coffee shop. Coffee was amazing and staff were extremely friendly. I hardly ever go out and dine on Roosevelt Row...but I will definitely return to this place often. Cheers***"}
{"text":"I met a coworker here for lunch this week after hearing such great things about Oliver's.  The space is bright and cheery, the staff is extremely friendly and the food is good.  I enjoyed a pixie juice of strawberry, pineapple and orange and a spinach and artichoke grilled cheese with champagne greens.  My coworker enjoyed Oliver's as they offer several vegan items to cater to her diet too.  Definitely worth a stop while in downtown Phoenix looking for some quick, tasty food or a coffee."}
{"text":"Great family owned spot. I went on a weekday morning to get work done while I was visiting Phoenix and it was perfect-- large clean space, lots of seating and outlets, not too loud music, delicious food, and amazing local coffee. The owners/managers (a family) are really nice people. I wish this place existed where I live!"}
{"text":"As a verifiable coffee snob, I've tried nearly all the coffee shops in Downtown/Central Phoenix. This place is great. The brew coffee is flavourful and strong and the latte was excellent. I have only had one item of food from their menu, but it was superb so I can assume the rest is good as well. Great atmosphere and friendly staff, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was day one of my journey of transitioning to a vegan lifestyle. And I was completely unprepared. :-/ I thought well today I'm just going to starve until I get back home tonight. But as I was driving I thought--Wait! Let me Yelp for vegan restaurants close to work. To my surprise, I was walking distance to this life saving gem! Pulled right up front and ran in to see what sounded good. It ALL sounded good! The staff was polite and friendly and very encouraging of my new life shift. The atmosphere was inviting and I loved the interior design of the place. Great big windows to look out and a lot of natural elements inside as well.  I got the vegan burrito and boy was it yummy and an excellent size for the $10 price tag. It actually afforded me two meals for the day! Half now. Half later. Score! I will be back often! This place is a must for healthy eating options regardless of your dietary title. Just eat good whole food!"}
{"text":"Good place to work or study.  Plenty of table space and outlets.  Friendly staff and good cold brew.  Huge downside is the fairly loud Christian music that is always played."}
{"text":"Must-Do Phoenix Venue for your Yummy list! From Vegan to traditional, to All-day Breakfast, to 20+ local organic food suppliers, this place has it all.  Oliver Bryan (co-owner) is the real deal. You will instantly feel at home in this, modern venue that includes a few tasteful large screen monitors.  Usually local or sporting events, video only so you can have a relaxing conversation in the dining room or the steel structure lounge below his office. Get out, get here, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have some mixed feelings about this place. They buy from local businesses, which I think is pretty great. They pander to the anti-science crowd though in regards to GMOs, which as a scientist, I don't honestly appreciate at all. But that is the popular trend right now and it is not why I am rating this place as less than stellar.   The general atmosphere is actually very pleasant. I love the lighting, the seating arrangement, and the spartan interior decoration, with music that is just quiet enough that you don't have to raise your voice to hear someone you are talking to. I haven't explored the menu too thoroughly but I did find their grilled cheese to be wonderful, if a bit overpriced. Their coffees tend to taste a bit milky. This is either because they skimp on the syrup pumps or they haven't quite figured out a balance between their expresso shots and milk portions. That said, some creative combinations on the part of the customer can create some satisfying lattes. The Arnold Palmer tea is very good but the measurements are arbitrary and you will not get a tea that tastes the same from one barista to the next.   It is a family owned business. I have not directly met the owner but the owner's father is there every day. While most of the other employees are very polite, I find the owner's father to be incredibly passive-aggressive. I have gone there nearly every day for two weeks, spending anywhere between $4 - $13 on food and drinks and always leaving tips, yet I always get the impression that he wants me out of his establishment. He once has even strongly encouraged me to sit in the back, where I am out of sight. Perhaps it is because I spend at least 3 hours studying whenever I go, or maybe it is because I take advantage of the free tea refills they offer, or maybe it is because when I am not in a lab, I just wear a tank top and gym shorts, I don't really know. One thing is certain though, I get the distinct impression that I am not welcome. When getting the tea refills, the father almost addresses me as though he believes I am stealing from him.   I imagine that most people will enjoy the place quite a bit and all things considered, I hope the place thrives. It is likely that my personal experience is an isolated one. It just is not a place I can visit in the future."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both time I received great service! The cold brew is great and refreshing. I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I Love This Place! Tell Everyone you know and don't know. I am so thankful for the selection of amazing food, drinks, and more. I can eat out again (gluten, dairy, and meat sensitive). Check it out and see for yourself. Mahal OSB and Family!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here about once a week since they opened. Excellent coffee. Fresh, delicious food.  It is always clean and the staff are helpful and friendly! You cannot go wrong spending some time and money here."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is clean and bright.  Staff are funny and helpful.  Food is beautifully presented (artful even) and tastes even better than it looks.  Must try!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Run, don't walk , to come here. Seriously, the food is amazing, the cold brew is to die for and the owners are some of the nicest people I've ever met.   Get here. Now!"}
{"text":"Restaurant/Ambience: Medium sized, uber-modern café and lunch spot. Extremely well maintained. Well lit with lots of natural light.  Decor is heavy on stainless steel and IKEA-ish feel. Typical patrons are from all ages but seem attract the Vegan-Vegetarian-Food Intolerance crowd.   Food: Great selection of hot/cold sandwhichs and salads, with most selections being Veggie/Vegan although they do offer some meats: tuna melt for example. The veggies used in the sandwich's and salads are some of the freshest I've had. They appear to source most of their food locally. Everything tastes extremely good and you can tell a lot time and expertise goes into the food.  Service: Everyone was extremely helpful, courteous, and respectful. Good vibes.  Price: Quit pricey. Most sandwich's are in the 9 to 10 dollar range. Portion sizes are on a appropriate scale for a health-conscientious person, but might be considered small for the price for others.  Overall: Restaurants geared toward the Vegan-Vegetarian-Food Intolerance crowd are becoming more common. Even if you don't find your self in the above categories you can appreciate the healthy/fresh/culinary-expertise factor in places like Oliver's. The only down side about Oliver's for me is the price. Phoenix has many other culinary-forward café's with better pricing."}
{"text":"This is a family-owned business and I absolutely recommend anyone to come here! The food is all organic and it's quite delicious! The staff is so incredibly friendly and they are proud of their place. It's in a great location and has a great vibe. The only reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 is because, though the food was yummy, it wasn't the best I've ever had. Regardless, this place is great and I suggest anyone to come eat here :)"}
{"text":"OMFG!!!! This place is insane!!!   Super clean modern decor. Gluten Free and vegan baked goods for days.   Midwestern values, hometown family feel.   Oliver is amazing and his parents help out and it's like having your pops feed you and make you breakfast in a bomb ass spot in downtown Phoenix.  92 5 star reviews... are you kidding? No, no joke. Go here and chill. Hop on the wifi it's like your parents living room but decorated by your best friend and next level snakes and coffee.  I can't even with this spot!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I went here and got the veggie chipotle wrap and it was lovely. There was nothing incredibly fancy about it which made it so good! Everything tastes fresh and the portions are huge. What's not to love?!?! Definitely will be back. By the way the vinaigrette they dress their greens with is delicious, very citrusy."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the vibe, love the owner's story, everything about it. We went in for a lunch. I had tuna melt and hubs had salad. Both things were delicious and just large enough. Coffee was great, loved that espresso is served in ceramic cup. I hope they will expand lunch menu a bit. Parking can be a hassle but it's downtown, so it's kinda given. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The owners are kind and so incredbly hard working.  The food is carefully prepared and tastes delicious! I prefer this place over jobot and some of the other coffee shops in the area.  They have high quality food and a great atmosphere.  It's the only place other than the library that I can study in.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Omg talk about obsessed. This place has become my Oasis from work during my lunch hour. The food is amazing, fresh, new, and satisfying to every palate. I am sure the coffee is also amazing I just don't drink coffee.I cant get enough of the food and desserts.Perfect ambiance for everything!!! Please keep doing what your doing awesome service also:-)"}
{"text":"Such a cool vibe and the staff and owners are wonderful!!!  Had already had lunch when we stopped in, so we just had a scone and an iced tea and iced coffee - all were delicious!!  Spent over 2 hours just relaxing and enjoying the spot!  We will definitely be back to try all the wonderful menus items, especially the vegan choices!! So glad to have a place that cares about healthy, clean food and still be hip!  Felt very at home here!  See you soon, Oliver, Gregory and Julie!"}
{"text":"I stop by once a month when I get my hair done next door.  I absolutely love everything on the menu but my favorite is the tuna melt.  On opening day I got a cup of coffee and I kid you not it was the most delicious coffee ever.  But seriously guys the tuna melt.  It's even cut up and served fancy even though this is a casual place.  Delicious, polite, comfortable, and friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious food, craft brews on tap and good vibes. They support local too so you know you're giving back while filling up."}
{"text":"This place is dope!    Super personable staff, fresh ingredients in all of their delicious food, their coffee is great (says the casual coffee drinker). Just had their carrot cake for the first time - it was, had-to-go-back-for-a-second-piece good..  They serve approx. 8 beers on tap (the majority of those being from Az brewers) and wine!  No need to choose between caffeine or booze eh! Prices are okay, but the experience makes up for any potential gripes.. I hope you enjoy Oliver's as much as I have!!   -Tim"}
{"text":"Yes! As good as it gets!  This has quickly become my go to coffee shop. BUT it's not just a coffee shop. Their food is amazing! They use quality ingredients and offer unique items on their menu. Their Humus plate is a MUST try!  Also, please try the Aussie. It's 2 shots of espresso over ice cream. You'll be wired for hours! The latte's are good also.   Great service, great spot to work out of also.  So happy they opened recently. Late hours also. Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Terrific place for lunch or coffee, employees are friendly and attentive, food is high quality, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Really good place. I liked it a lot . Lemonade excellent. Sandwich so good.  .good place to come back. Thanks"}
{"text":"Oliver is the sweetest man! Be sure to chat him up! Also, don't be afraid to ask for a punch card because I know you'll keep coming back here for more! ;)"}
{"text":"What a lovely edition to the new ever changing Roosevelt row area. The open space is very clean and inviting. The staff makes you feel like a regular the minute you walk in the door.  What I really think is neat is the coffee shop and the wine bar share the same space so everyone is happy... the coffee drinkers and the beer/ wine crowd.  I happened to be both.  We were treated to an inspiring conversation by the owner Oliver Stone who has a miracle life changing story to share.  He also recommended a wine (Purple Heart) which I had never tried but loved. My friend had a latte and a pumpkin scone which was delicious. (Yes, I know she ordered it but I ate it!)   I look for to returning to try some of the menu items because the choices were ample and looked delicious.   It's conveniently located near many theaters and parking is ample."}
{"text":"I just have to say that this is the most friendly coffee place that is downtown. Also, I cannot get their breakfast burritos out of my head! Best burrito I've had and they gave us an extra hot salsa that was to die for if you like hot stuff. I would buy the salsa alone it's that good."}
{"text":"The people that work here are super nice. We had never been here before and we didn't feel pressured to order upon arrival. The friendly guy that was ringing us up even recommended some favorites. He was on point with his recommendations. Another gentleman also came about halfway through our meal to check if we needed anything. We will be visiting again very soon!! So glad I live so close by!"}
{"text":"Delish americanos for a really great price. Staff is super nice, ceilings are high, view is lovely. A welcome addition to the Row!"}
{"text":"Great tasting americano/espresso and food; the salad I had was amazing. The price point is the best I've seen in the city. Check it out."}
{"text":"When I saw a five star cafe in the heart of downtown, I knew I had to come here for lunch. I loved how spacious Oliver's was and how the walls are made up of floor to ceiling windows which was great for people watching. I asked the lady at the counter for a recommendation and I got the Wild Tuna Melt that she suggested. Best choice ever! It had a hint of spice; I'm a pansy with anything spicy and I thought it was the perfect amount of zing. The service was amazing as well! I think the chef brought out my food personally and made sure I didn't need anything else."}
{"text":"Oliver's Bean not only has great cold-brew coffee but the vegetarian menu is truly great! The proprietors are so accommodating and nice to talk to. A friendly, open environment with tons of places to hook-up your electronic devices! A great place to have a meeting or just meet friends."}
{"text":"Repeat visit for me, great coffee and friendly staff keeps me coming back.  My son had some organic banana bread that he was nice enough to share.  Of course he was happy knowing there was free WiFi."}
{"text":"My crew and I came here early and often during last semester's study cram for finals and found the place pleasant, welcoming and most importantly, open late.  Unlimited refills on black coffee? Check Beer and wine for post-study? Check Couches in a secluded alcove? Check Friendly service? Check Affordable? Check Clean? Check Check? I don't know, I paid credit  Oliver's isn't in a competition to be the most hipster of all coffee shops (go to Lux if you want that).  Also, try the food. It's fantastic."}
{"text":"Oliver's is tucked within Roosevelt Row in Phoenix. This area is really growing into a nice hang out spot.   The overall feeling inside is fresh and new given it's silver and industrial design, it's not your typical cozy coffee shop. You'll notice a board of local vendors that they work with which is great. The have some delicious vegan meal options to eat and other healthy snacks.   I tried the vegan breakfast burrito and really enjoyed it. I also tried the pumpkin pie latte which was not vegan, but it was delicious.   Great spot to work remote in, grab a drink, or lunch."}
{"text":"I was lured in by cold brew but unfortunately it was flat and watered down.  Maybe it was just an off day, or maybe other reviewers just haven't had good cold brew.  I like the looks of the place and their breakfast sounds good.  They had a vegan breakfast burrito on the menu which excited me because my husband is lactose intolerant and we love a good breakfast burrito.  I asked what kind of vegan cheddar they use and the cook said they got rid of it because it didn't melt well -_-  Hopefully they try something new or update the menu.  They have fresh herbs being grown in planters when you walk in which cozies up the massive shop.  I will try again when I'm in the mood for something OTHER than cold brew."}
{"text":"Fresh veggie chipotle wrap for lunch! I got lettuce wraps instead of a spinach tortilla! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow! Great place for coffee, food and other amazing beverages! It's an amazing space for working meetings or just hanging out. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I have been patiently waiting for this coffee place to open, and now it has.... Huzzah. This coffee shop is large, in a good location, and has a trendy vibe. The owner and his dad were extremely nice, welcoming, and helpful. I had a conversation with each of them, and they seemed to be invested in quality ingredients and their customer base. If you haven't heard their story, the owner of this coffee shop suffered from a traumatic brain injury and went through extensive rehab. This shop is an incredible accomplishment and an inspiration to others who may have to overcome adversity. Go Oliver!  Now on to the coffee....they use locally roasted beans (bergies) and local (expensive) milk (danzeisen), so of course my latte tasted good! You can't go wrong with high quality local ingredients. Additionally, the latte was fairly priced at 3.80 after tax. I was a bit sad that they don't have chai yet, but Oliver said he would work on getting it soon. I would highly recommend you get your behind down here and check out this coffee shop!  Ps - I know there are many good coffee shops in the neighborhood, I wouldn't say this one is better than the rest, but a definite contender...I think I need to start a rotation"}
{"text":"Been there three or 4 times now for coffee and a snack. Good coffee and lattes, owners are very nice and enjoy talking to customers. Best thing is on the weekend they are open until midnight. Have not yet tried the food but it sure looks good."}
{"text":"I can not say enough good things about this establishment. The gentleman who was working was so kind. The breakfast burrito I purchased was probably one of the best i've had in the valley.   Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure stopping by Oliver's! The food and coffee are so good. Has excellent wifi!"}
{"text":"Loved this place the spring goat was delicious and tasted fresh! It was a pleasant place to spend my lunch at! Erik Els review is ridiculous to lower your star rating because of a opinion as a \"scientist.\" Who belittles other people's preferences over GMO. Personally I could take them or leave them.  BTW. Most doctors don't get more than one required nutrition class.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice in 5 days and I can't wait to go back again. The atmosphere is enjoyable and the owner and his dad are great. I ordered the sweet potato bruschetta and The Goat (a salad with goat cheese, agave sweetened pecans, yellow bell pepper, cranberries and a delicious balsamic dressing. It was delicious. I ordered it again the second visit and also shared the artichoke grilled cheese on the gluten free bread. It was AMAZING! It has turkey on it so be sure to ask for no meat if you are a vegetarian. I also tried the carrot cake (yum!) and the black bean brownie (it was a bit heavy on the baking soda) but a decent chocolate desert if you are GF. Considering the accident that Oliver had, it is quite impressive to see him over come a traumatic brain injury and running a restaurant. I look forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"Really good coffee and food. GF bread (not made in house) is to die for."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, this place is incredible. Gregory, was absolutely so wonderful! He was attentive and kind. The food here was phenomenal!!! We left full and happy without the after, \"overloaded, sluggish, gluttonous,\" feeling. The menus are separated by vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free. The bathrooms are sparkling clean and the have convenient, free parking in the back. We will definitely be coming back here, and asking for Gregory to help us again."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what downtown Phoenix has been waiting for! The chef who has a nutritional background is putting out some of the best dishes I have had in a cafe. Great atmosphere with an industrial vibe, and really good coffee and espresso!"}
{"text":"Oliver's is a great, low key place to come study, have a meeting or just to grab a cup a coffee to go. It is quiet and doesn't feel the need to blast music like some other hipster places (I'm looking at you- the Lux). The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is calm and chill. Definitely would recommend for coffee, the breakfast sandwiches, and the Clubber for lunch."}
{"text":"Friendly service- nice selection of coffee and food- lots of space- plenty of outlets to charge your electronics- open late-all around great!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat healthy food, drink awesome coffee, study, have a meeting, hang out, etc. Open 7am-midnight every day (except Sun it opens at 3pm)."}
{"text":"What can we say that hasn't been said? Amazing place to eat. We had the Quinoa Arizona salad. What a work of art. All fresh ingredients and made with such love. This concept of fresh, healthy, local foods is a win win. Hope one day we can say we remember when it all began! Love to see hundreds of these locations some day! This is the future!"}
