{"text":"A little gem indeed! Very good prices and awesome food. I'm a picky eater when it comes to Mexican food and this place is great. Have tried the torta, burrito, and nachos. (Different occasions of course) All fantastic and the nachos are just loaded with goodies. My favorite meat choice there is the boiled steak and my boyfriend likes the tongue!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome little place. A short walk from the convention center. It is a perfect place to take a little stroll from whatever craziness you are in town for, get away from the crowds and relax with a good lunch.  The food is awesome, real Latin mom and pop type deal and a cheap price.  The tamales are a good choice and you can get a taco for super cheap. Awesome options as they have everything from pork and chicken to beef tongue and head.  Definitely stop in if you have a chance."}
{"text":"I was at the Las Vegas Convention Center South Hall. The food options at the tradeshow were minimal and did not work with my diet. I walked out and found this little gem. Cash only. The staff is friendly. The good was very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Clean, great price, fresh food and the staff are very friendly.   Great place to take the family. Visit for  volleyball tournament. We will be back when we return Vegas. We found our new spot in Vegas. The outside doesn't look much and the lights need to be fixed but don't let that stop you from visiting.   Two visits in two days. Yum. Thanks La costa."}
{"text":"We are originally from Houston, Texas and were in search for good seafood and great micheladas. The food was phenomenal and the waitress super sweet and fast. We got here a little late on Christmas Day and we felt bad and wanted to rush out but the owner came to us and told us to please stay and finish our food. Super nice people and amazing food. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is a great little hidden gem. Very reasonably priced authentic Mexican.   3 tacos and a burrito with some horchata make for a happy food coma.   The staff are always friendly and willing to explain what an item is if you're not familiar with it.   I'm really glad I live nearby, otherwise I might never have discovered this place."}
{"text":"Great tacos and fresh guacamole made while you wait. Not the fanciest restaurant but great food at a great price."}
{"text":"Nice Mexican restaurant with nice service and good food. Could be a bit cleaner though."}
