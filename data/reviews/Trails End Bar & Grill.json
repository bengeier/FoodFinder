{"text":"Great place! Don, the bartender, Wed-Sun nights (3-9) is great! Very funny and does magic tricks at the bar!  The food is pretty good- big fan of the quesadilla, wings, bruschetta for starters. I have not had a bad special for dinner. It is a resort so expect to pay a little extra but they do have all the football games on!"}
{"text":"I had the Breakfast Burrito for lunch and it was excellent. The service was friendly but not very responsive. Everyone in our group liked what they ordered.  Despite the service I'd definitely go back and try some of the other menu items I was eyeing."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting, and after mentioning that we had a problem with our first, the manager, Dave, invited my wife and I back for a meal on the house. The food here was incredible, I got the ribs and my wife ordered Agave Chicken. Both meals came with cooked asparagus, and we also ordered the carne asada nachos. All of the food we ordered was delicious, and the portions were very large. Dave took an outstanding customer-oriented approach to making sure we came back and left their restaurant wanting to come back after our second visit, and that's exactly what happened. You cannot always prevent issues, but this place (and Dave especially) really knows how to take care of them and rectify the situation, which I believe is what counts. Highly recommend, the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim because of a Groupon offer. We also decided it would be a good place to try because of the good reviews on yelp and Groupon.  WRONG!    First off, it's not very clear where the restaurant is. None of the signs say the name of the restaurant and if it weren't for a pamphlet at the entry we wouldn't have known for certain where we were. We were seated quickly, the place wasn't very full so we weren't concerned about a long wait.  After being seated we order drinks and it took a while for anyone to come back around. The man who took and brought our drink order turned out to not be our waiter so despite being ready to order we had to wait for a server. It was 26 minutes before the server came to our order. During this time many other tables were seated. Other people ordered their food as well and we waited. In the hour and six minutes that we waited for food three other tables seated after us received food. One table also ordered and received dessert in that time. Another table got their food, ate it, paid and left before we were served. Now you may wonder what we had ordered?  Maybe it was something that takes a long time?  NOTHING TAKES THAT LONG TO PREPARE.  We ordered their fish taco special, grilled salmon and a quesadilla.  We were on borrowed time at this point as it was nearing our children's bed time and they were starving as were we. We paid our bill and requested to go boxes before our food arrived. Despite that we still didn't get our bill settled until we were half way through our food. And we also ended up waiting fo the to go boxes.  I wouldn't actually tell anyone to come here unless they were already at the gold course or if they aren't hungry.  Need a drink? This is your place!  Want a delicious meal that takes and hour and half to get?  Then this is where you should eat.   Now you may be wondering why I still gave them 3 stars. Our waitress was very nice in spite of her obviously being over burdened with tables. The prickly margaritas were actually quite good and reasonably priced for a gold course. Lastly, the food was actually very good. The grilled salmon was as close to perfect as I could expect from a standard American restaurant, the quesadilla was actually grilled and the cheese was melted ( since being in Arizona we have noticed a lack of melted cheese) and the fish tacos were fantastic.   Will we return here? NO  Is this place kid friendly? NO  Is there a diaper changing table in the bathroom? NO  Will I tell people to go here? Probably not  If you do go here use a Groupon or the check in offer for 20% off. Other wise it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Food was ok but service not so good. It took 40 min to get the food... don't know if I want to came back."}
{"text":"Yuck.  It took an hour for our food to arrive, which was barely warm and all looked like something Applebee's would serve (it tasted worse then Applebee's). Ribs were boiled, slathered in bland sweet barbecue sauce and then charred under a boiler - no flavor. The meal came with a loaded baked potato and asparagus which, again, had no flavor (no seasoning and we all suspected the side dishes had been sitting out for hours - not freshly made to order).   We also order calamari which was all agreed came out of a freezer bag - limp, soggy, no crunch and once again no seasoning.   Also one of our table members order the scallops appetizer for his meal - for $15 he only got three small scallops- which of course made him not only sad but annoyed since he asked the waitress if it would be enough to be considered a meal. Also, we all agreed that three is a really odd number for an appetizer, how do you split this appetizer easily with a group?   For a resort and the prices they charge we expected something much better.   The building itself is very out dated, the ac was leaking inside the restaurant with a bucket to catch the water. The staff seemed not engaged and not even willing to recognize that they had a table of unhappy customers.   If you stay at the resort stay for the golf, but skip the restaurant."}
{"text":"While staying at the Legacy golf resort we ordered take out, just some appetizers and a dessert. The crab cakes, quesadillas and chocolate cake were very good. The fried calamari were just OK. The staff was nice and the food was ready pretty quick, although the restaurant wasn't very busy when I went in."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Legacy Golf Resort and decided to have dinner here since it was in the resort and we had a gift certificate from www.restaurant.com.  Service: The service was good but not great.  I had to ask for bread more than once but it game out.  Our server knew the dinner menu pretty well but had no idea about breakfast (he only worked there for dinner shifts) but he was able to find out the answers to our questions.  Food: The food was decent.  This is what we had... - Calamari: overcooked and very chewy.  I would not recommend this!  - Angus Burger: I ordered the burger and it was quite tender and juicy.  The fries that it came with were crispy and seasoned.  The veggies were also crisp and fresh.  - Ribs: My wife ordered the rack of ribs and those were delicious.  Highly recommended.  The meat was very tender but it wasn't falling off the bone.  There was plenty of meat on the ribs and the bbq sauce was sweet and tangy.  She had the Sicilian potatoes which were very tasty (sliced potatoes with onions, ham, cheese).  This dish had a lot of food and she was only able to finish half the rack.  Overall, the Trails End Grill had decent service and good food.  It is well worth it if you get a cheap gift certificate from www.restaurant.com."}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from this restaurant through grubhub. The food was superb but the delivery not so much. Three out the last 4 times I've orderd something was wrong. The first two times I ordered 1 blueberry muffin and one chocolate. The first time I got 2 blueberry and the second time I got 2 chocolate. Not big deal as they cost the same and were eaten. The last time I ordered 2 lunches entrees for my mother and I. I ordered the pest flatbread with a side of tots, not side arrived. The food is great and the service was nice, but it gets annoying to not have the order correct."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, lunch and dinner!!  Fast and friendly service, yummy food and relaxing atmosphere!  We love to sit on the patio overlooking the golf course at sunset.    Must haves: Breakfast Burrito - and the breakfast potatoes that come with it are killer!   Buffalo Wings  Calamari - this is my absolute favorite - crispy, crunchy and delicious!  Prime Rib Dinner   Trail's End Grill does not disappoint!!  So, whether you are staying at the resort, playing a round of golf or just happen to be in the neighborhood, stop by for a bite!  You'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant surprise to have such a delicious dinner after our round of golf. Normally wouldn't dare order salmon dinner at a golf restaurant, but so glad I did! Perfectly cooked salmon, asparagus and cilantro rice with a nice butter/lime glaze...my mouth waters just thinking about it!  Others ordered burgers and said they were delicious too!  Service was great with a friendly staff, and they were pretty busy when we arrived which is a good thing in my book...lots of folks know how good the food is here!  Pretty casual, so come as you are!"}
{"text":"We went here for their prime rib special on Friday night. Our waitress was very nice, but the service was slow. They were a little busy too, but still not a reason to not refill my husbands water. The prime rib was good."}
{"text":"I had breakfast twice, dinner once, and happy hour once at this nice restaurant located at the Legacy Golf Resort in Phoenix, Arizona.  Spent a week here at this fabulous resort and the restaurant lived up to the reputation of being a fine dining choice.  One morning I had the Western Omelette and it was delicious and quite large so much so that I couldn't finish it.  On another occasion, I had the Eggs Benedict and that also was delicious.  My dinner choice one evening was the Rib Eye Steak which was cooked perfectly medium rare like I like it and I was quite satisfied.  Again, I could not finish the whole steak which was almost 16 ounces.    It is nice to be able to have a fine meal and not have to leave the resort and we were happy that The Trails End Bar & Grill was there.  BTW, all of our servers were excellent and even gave us tips on other dining establishments in the nearby area."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came in with a Groupon, when we walked in a server gave us two menus and said we can sit anywhere that's open. I asked if we could sit outside on the patio and she said yes anywhere that's open again. So we sat outside on one half of the patio that wasn't as crowded. There was a few tables that needed to be bussed because there was cups and trash on them but we found a clean one and sat down. We were sitting for almost 30 minutes and no one ever approached us but the tables on the other side of the patio were getting served. There were three servers who all looked over at us but no one approached the table. I had to get up, go inside and tell the bartender we needed a server and we've been sitting for awhile. Finally someone came to our table and told us \"we actually don't serve on this side of the patio\". Okay that is perfectly fine if they don't serve on one half of the patio I am not upset about that. However, the fact that three employees physically looked at us with menus sitting down staring at them waiting for someone to come over ? No one ever asked if we needed help or even acknowledged we were even there. So rude and unprofessional. Do they not want money? Anyone could have came up to us and informed us in the 30 minutes we were sitting down but instead they ignored us until we complained. Never coming back ."}
{"text":"Super service.   Kinda too \"resorty\" food.  Limited menu.  Food was good but not everyone likes rosemary potatoes for breakfast.   Plain potatoes or hash browns are easy to add.  We will be back.  :)"}
{"text":"OK, I posted the bad, now I will post the good.  As I mentioned two weeks ago, my wife and I go here frequently.  Two weeks ago there was an entire golf tournament trying to eat and drink in a place that was staffed with only two people.  Yesterday (see photo) it was the restaurant we have grown to love.  We both had the fish lunch.  Mine with delicious crispy fries and my wife with grilled asparagus.  The four fillets of fish were light and crisp and not greasy.  (The lemons were a little bit dried out, and they actually did forget the pico de gallo printed on the menu.)  The fries great and the asparagus wonderful.  The tea still tasted a little strange to me, so I sent back the ice tea and got a Pepper Mary (Bloody Mary with paper around the rim).  For two of us, the total bill came to $35 including tip.  Whew... I thought we were going to have to find a new dive.  I am not going to delete the previous review, because it was an actual experience, albeit an exception rather than the rule.  I highly recommend this place WITH the caveats mentioned on my previous post:  keep a menu, check your plate, etc."}
{"text":"We just moved into the neighborhood and have dined at Trails end a number of times with family and friends. The food and service never disappoint and the happy hour menu is great too!"}
{"text":"Over the past two years, I have always considered the food and the service to be great.  As of late, the menu has been revamped and the food is even better than before!  If you haven't tried it recently or this may be your first time in, I definitely recommend enjoying a meal (or several) here. The staff is always friendly and welcoming and the specials are all great."}
{"text":"This is really a typical golf restaurant. The menu was surprisingly big and there was quite a lot of seating. There are daily specials that I'd be willing to go back and try.   I only have one complaint and it's a big one. The night I was there was a week night. The bar had clearly over served several other guests and the bar was just a big rowdy drunk group of people yelling and drinking. The amount of people in there that were clearly very drunk seemed somewhat inappropriate."}
{"text":"The driver told me that there was nobody at the front desk and have to go to the office to get someone, horrible experience. I actually love the egg, but some of the potatoes were unfresh.  They did not give me the coffee that hive order."}
{"text":"Be aware that they are no longer accepting the restaurant.com certificates. The food was decent but not great for the price with out the discount. We were disappointed at the change in policy since our certificate had already been purchased."}
{"text":"Another good meal with good service! We split a Reuben. She got the fries and I ordered an extra side salad. They brought me some extra french fries anyway. Not to be expected every time, but it was a nice surprise this time."}
{"text":"This is easy yet hard to explain.  So many different things to say and I can't find one thing that stood out to be good.  Not great but just good.  First of all, their touted Chef's Special of ribs was not available so I as all of this party ordered the new york strip.  Awfully average, undercooked as to mooing was less rare.  An ice cream scooper of garlic mashed that appeared to be out of a box as mine had a flake or two and 3 spears of asparagus was the final plate.  After waiting at the hostess desk for 10 minutes, one more and we were out the door, a waitress, the only one of a bunch of two, the other sporting a man bun, seated us with dirty dishes in her arms. We ordered our drinks after finally getting our menus, another 5 to 10 minutes and the beer I ordered was cold and came quickly.  A good point I guess.  Food arrived on time but a little late in my book.  The waiter was very nice when we spoke to him when we saw him.  Never saw him again, dinner done, no beer, no margs and dirty plate every where.  Then came the Caesar salad my friend ordered for before the meal.  He ate it with a cold glass of water.  Here's the catch.  No Management and if I would have been able to talk to them I would have told them they should be ashamed for putting this staff in an all out failure mode.   I still upped the tip to 30% because it was not the fault of our server but full blame goes onto the back or backs of owners. Rating:  AAAC or AVOID AT ALL COSTS"}
{"text":"The restaurant at the resort and golf course is pretty good.  They had a good special on appetizers later in the evening.  The to go service at the bar was slow but the waitress and hostess service was very good."}
