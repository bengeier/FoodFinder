{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on a trip to montreal. We ordered the blue fairy and figaro sandwiches as a recommendation. Both were fantastic!! Definitely coming back again, everyone should go and get the great service. Such a cozy place!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich shops/cafes I've been to in a while. My friend and I had 2 different, equally delicious sandwiches and a couple of the Italian pastries for dessert. The coffee was also excellent, and the owner (i think) even gave us a few delicious cold espressos to enjoy on the terrasse next to his tomato garden. Will be going back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Tres bon café. Proprio sympathique. Un peu petit, mais vient d'ouvrir. Définitivement à essayer :)"}
{"text":"Super petit bijou du quartier. Le staff est super accueillant et sympathique. Et la nourriture.. Waow ! Les sandwich sont divins et les cakes fondent dans la bouche. À essayer !"}
{"text":"Toujours aussi cool le service et souriant vraiment un petit endroit sympa tranquille et relax"}
{"text":"Beau ET bon petit café de quartier! Ils vendent même du pain italien succulent! (Ils prennent seulement l'argent comptant, mais ce n'est qu'un détail)"}
{"text":"Une magnifique place!!! La nourriture est délicieuse et très abordable! Les proprios sont très sympathiques et offrent un très bon service. L'ambiance est parfaite pour un bon café/grilled cheese le samedi matin!"}
{"text":"The most adorable spot discovered through passport barista! It's called Pinocchio! It's small; and the aroma of fresh bake good warms you up. Since it's named after Pinocchio, their menu is named after the main characters from the beloved animation, like Blue Fairy, Jiminy Cricket, Figaro and many more. 

I was served by Kay! What a lovely person! When it wasn't busy, I had a lovely conversation with her. She explained me the story behind the coffeeshop' name. The shop's owner's father is in construction and he enjoys the wood. He loves the rustic feel like Geppetto, from the animation, hence the title of the shop.

I took a delicious latte and the best ever almond croissant (it had lots of almonds unlike any pastry place). 

I highly recommend this beautiful, delicious and friendly place."}
{"text":"Tiny little place with 8 seats. Great coffee and deserts. They make great grilled cheese sandwiches. They panini grill their sandwiches with great fillings. Neighbourhood cafe with limited parking. Of course in summer they have a great terrace on the side.  Good place to grab a latte and read your paper on a lazy sunday morning. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A cute litte cafe that was included in my passport barista. The cafe is very small but cozy with a few stools near the window where you can sit and enjoy your coffee. There is a lot of cute artwork around the cafe of pinocchio. So if you are a disney fan like me you will enjoy the atmosphere. My chai latte was perfect and there were many delicious snacks to choose from. The barista was very kind and helpful. Definitely a nice little spot to visit on a cold day for a yummy hot drink."}
{"text":"This is my favourite coffee place in Montreal. The cappuccino is very affordable, the people are so friendly, the sandwiches are great and the cookies with ricotta cheese and lemon are simply divine. But most of all, I love their cozy, warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"Le personnel est vraiment très sympathique, rien à redire non plus sur la petite terrasse l'été un peu à l'écart des grandes rues... Je n'ai pas été trop impressionnée par le café mais les sandwichs sont à tomber (mais un peu hors-budget pour moi...). Ca vaudra au moins le coup de retenter cet hiver après quelques mois de roulement!"}
{"text":"great locals place went twice while in town felt very welcome each time will come back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"When we visited Montréal, we got breakfast here every morning as we were staying at an Airbnb a block away. The place is really affordable, the service is super friendly, and the coffee is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Petite sandwicherie de quartier à Villeray à saveur italienne. Grilled cheese au provolone, cheddar, cheddar bacon tomates, etc. Autres sandwichs aussi disponibles.
Les \"fers à cheval au nutella\" sont extraordinaires. Un dessert ou collation parfaite. 
Breuvages italiens dont San Pellegrino et cie.
Sympathique proprio."}
{"text":"What can i say...just an amazing place to be...coffee is great and the people are super friendly. 
The sandwiches are just to die for,,,,and the pastries and cakes superb..The place has just added extra seating by removing  the large fridge..so more seating .  The terrace is a bonus in this area..most  new coffee  shops in Villeray barely have a toilet to use...this place is the hidden jewel of Villeray.

A defenite cafe to see in Villeray...no rush..no gossip..no problem...
a family vibe.. AND THE PRICES ARE JUST INCREDIBLE for what they give you..


At any given time a family member is here to help you with anything you  wanna eat or drink...
Tell your friends to pass by...you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place makes you feel like you're family. I just keep going back to have Italian style lattes and incredibly buttery grilled cheese sandwiches in the company of those fabulous people. So much love."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Villeray: this place has AMAZING sandwiches. Fresh, tasty, made with love and awesome ingredients. The staff is super nice, and the terrace in the summer is very laid back. Dog-friendly! Thanks for a super chill lunch experience..."}
{"text":"Thank you to Yelp for leading me to this adorable little coffee shop in the neighborhood where I was staying. I dropped by here one morning and got a small coffee ( which was veeeery small) and a Kouign Amann. The coffee was so rich and perfectly frothed....the flavor was fantastic. The pastry was even better! Perfect in every way. The price was on point, less than 5$. Would highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Small european cafe serving a lovely choice of deserts and coffee. They also serve breakfast. I love lattes and was happy with mine. François served me and was very friendly and gave a good service. 

The name explains all the Pinocchio theme decorations which makes it unique. There's construction going on so it looks like they are expanding."}
