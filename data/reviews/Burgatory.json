{"text":"Went here with a party of four last night, and we had a great time!  It wasn't where I expected to find it; sandwiched between a TJ Maxx and a Marshalls, but it lived up to the reviews.  Got there around 7:30 and told there was a twenty to thirty minute wait which was fine with me because I can always shop, but we were seated within ten minutes.  No one was super starving, so we skipped on appetizers.  Solid beer selection which pleased our group.  They also have alcoholic milkshakes.  One person ordered the granddad.  Holy booze - this shake was delicious, but there big and strong so be careful!!

BURGERs:  You can choose from organic, free range beef, bison, chicken breast or a veggie burger for all of the burgers.  I don't eat a lot of red meat, so when I go all in when I get a burger!  Two of us got the Monty; peppercorn rub, horseradish cheese with a Cabernet sauce and onions... SO GOOD.  Ordered medium rare and they were perfect.  Other side of the table did the custom burgers and they were extremely happy as well.  Burgers come with homemade potato chips, but you can also substitute fries and coleslaw too.  Chips were great, and the fries were good too (they had some kind of rosemary seasoning).  By the end of dinner, everyone's plate was empty.  Service was great too!

Bottom line: Check it out."}
{"text":"Burgatory, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.

Come on, it's a build your own burger bar, and it's fantastic. Add-ons on top of add-ons for those with poor self control and little regard for what makes a sensible burger (you mean I can put a fried egg on top AND have 2 kinds of cheese AND bacon? it's a good thing I don't eat like this all the time) means it could cost a pretty penny, but the entire experience is so worth it. If you have a love/hate relationship with your intestines, go for the milkshakes as well. The waitstaff has always been nothing short of friendly and attentive and seem pretty genuinely jazzed to be there, and so should you.

I can't say for all days of the week, but the wait is usually ~45 minutes in my experience. Troll around Barnes and Noble for a while, and let the spirit of the Waterworks wash over you.

They've opened up a new spot at the Waterfront, and it might be a bigger space, but the OG location has won my heart."}
{"text":"Their caramel pretzel shake is awesome. I was expecting something way too sweet from the description, but the saltiness and the crunch of the pretzels really balances it out well.

I didn't quite enjoy my Morty's Steakhouse burger... I prefer simpler burgers with no condiments where you can really taste the meat. The meat itself was perfectly pink and juicy but I didn't like that the bottom bun was soaked with grease. Also wasn't a big fan of the Haystack Onions (I've had better onions that style, from Flour in Boston). Overall, it was fat overload, especially with the shake.

I would like to try a custom creation next time, without any sauces or fancy toppings (and no shake - that thing is a meal of its own!) I actually enjoyed the cracked peppercorn rub a lot - flavorful without being overpowering - and I'm curious about the other rubs, too."}
{"text":"I have only been here once but I can't wait to take my husband here. I loved the bison burger and the shakes are all I can crave now that it's summer.  Carmel Pretzel was what I tried and it was great because the pretzel bites were not soggy the whole time I drank it. Service was good, not overly friendly but didn't leave us hanging for a long time."}
{"text":"I'm pretty much obsessed with this place. The milkshakes are so amazing, so big and decadent, that they've ruined milkshakes for me that I used to love before I knew how great milkshakes could truly be. My favorite is the Cookie Monster shake which has nice chunks of chocolate chip cookie mixed in. I always order the same burger -- Phat Patty's Veggie burger. I'm no longer a vegetarian but I was for a long time and I still get a craving for a veggie burger now and then. Honestly, this is the best veggie burger I've ever had. I adore it. It's so flavorful. I thought about giving this place a 4 because sometimes the servers haven't been very friendly. However the food is so good that I'm going for 5 stars."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. First of all, the prices are outrageous. $14 for a burger with cheese, lettuce & tomatoes? That's the \"Meet Your Maker\" burger & the one I ordered. Oh you want fries? $1.50 extra for that. So $15.50 for a smallish burger & fries. My friend got the standard deluxe with fries. She asked for bacon & was told that they could bring bacon out on a side plate next to the burger but NO, they would not add the bacon onto the burger before serving it to her. That's some hipster nonsense right there. Whatever.

So first I get the wrong burger. As in, not the one I ordered. I send it back. I watch my friend eat 3/4 of her food before my correct burger comes out. I ordered it PINK. It came out EXTREMELY WELL DONE. This is like the TENTH TIME that I have attempted to order a pink burger & gotten one that was well done at Burgatory. I mean, it's literally a JOKE to me at this point. I wasn't even surprised that they overcooked it. My friend suggested I send it back AGAIN but at this point, she was done with her food & I wasn't waiting another 15 minutes. Oh and guess what else? Our buns were very stale. Nice & tough & crumbly. Yum.

The bill comes... nothing was comped. I wasn't expecting a free meal but maybe free french fries? Or $5 off the bill? Nothing. 

Total price for two iced teas & two burgers with fries? $35. THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS. I tipped the waitress 20% on top of that, even though she messed up my order. So that brought it to $42.

If you want mediocre food not cooked to order, an attitude about adding bacon to your burger and to be price-gouged, then by all means, continue to patronize this overrated chain restaurant. Otherwise, SKIP IT."}
{"text":"It is unbelievable when it comes to having a burger. It should not take more than 15 minutes to be seated, but it usually takes a lot longer. I usually go to Five Guys, which has a max wait time of 15 minutes. Easily, you can buy four Five Guys burgers for the price of two burgatory burgers."}
{"text":"Went back last night with fam. Consistecy is KEY!  Burgatory has never disappointed! The staff is awesome; Burgers still on point and I SWEAR the STILL the best damn margarita I've EVER had!!! Ask for Orlando to make yours!"}
{"text":"Love love this place! The burgers are incredible and you can build your own with so many delicious toppings and seasonings! My favorite though are the incredible milk shakes and the truffle fries! Sometimes I just go and eat those two things! Sooo good!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries... The best milkshakes. I love the build your own burger. I was able to put things on my burger like horseradish cheddar cheese and sirachacha remoulade. The truffle fries are incredible! The best things ever.. I have been seriously thinking about them daily. I had the S'mores milkshake, which was super yummy. It was creamy, had the caramelized marshmallow flavor, and the hint of milk chocolate after flavor was to die for! I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday afternoon with the wife for the first time.  We were seated quickly but we aimlessly looked at the menu for about 4 or 5 minutes before our waitress stopped by.  She asked if we had been there before (we hadn't) and then haphazardly explained the menu (\"You can order one of the pre-designed burgers or make your own by filling out this form.\") and the concept.  They have all these different rubs and sauces and such.  Some of them are self-explanatory but then there are others that you have no clue what is in them (such as the angel dust).  Having never been there and the fact that my wife is pregnant and can't have gluten or lots of sugar/carbs (and I explained this to the waitress), we had a lot of questions.  Our waitress wasn't very happy about that.
As for the food, I ordered the topless bison burger with horseradish cheddar, the truffle aioli, the bayou cajun rub, pickles, onions, mixed greens and banana peppers with the quinoa salad.  The wife ordered the hormone free beef burger with white american, mayo, lettuce, pickles and angel dust and the organic mixed greens (salad).  The bison burger was good, between the cheese and rub it had a nice kick to it.  There was so much mixed greens that it was impossible to see the burger.  The quinoa salad was kind of bland, if not for the bell peppers and goat cheese.  The beef burger was good, but kind of your standard burger.  The wife really would have liked to have pepper jack cheese instead of the white american, but the pepper jack isn't offered.
All-in-all, we felt it was an underwhelming experience, considering the price and the hoopla associated with the place.  We probably won't go back again.  Oh, and make sure that you pay with something other than the Discover Card, they don't accept it."}
{"text":"Honestly so overrated. Everyone talks my ear off about this place but the burgers aren't anything special, the milkshake i had was WAY too sweet and i seriously like my sweets. The worst thing about it was the prices; simply ridiculous. The place is way too small also. Honestly i'd rather eat at the five guys next door the burgers are better. Oops. Won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Great tasting burger, of course, cooked to order correctly, this is apparently not as easy as it sounds! But they got it right :-)  
Setting has REeeally close booths and tables... I felt like our date night included the couple next to us!  = -1 star, 
If you don't know  the system,  the Staff can be kinda snarky to help you through your burger order, you've gotta fill out a order slip with your preferences, and just hand it in. My Wait person was not happy we weren't \"ready\" and neither was I... long delay until she got back.  It wasn't filled yet, but it was Saturday, so guess she knew the crowd was coming.  But that's why we went early... to not be rushed through!  = -1 star"}
{"text":"I'm not a burger fun , but I can eat almost one burger here
The good thing is I can creat my own burger."}
{"text":"I was there in the morning during the week.  Service was decent.   I order the Farmers burger and had one bottle of beer.   That came to over $18 which is pretty expensive to me when you come away hungry.   There are better places for the money."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our visit here.  hubby started with a Samoa (girl scout cookie) non - spiked shake.  I had the salted caramel and pretzel shake spiked with chocolate vodka.  His was great.  Mine had a fantastic flavor, but the pretzels eventually got soggy and all clumped together on the bottom of the glass.  I just didnt eat that part and iy was fine.  We then ordered the Holy 'Mole which is a great guacamole and chips.  The guac had a slight spice which was very tasty.  Husband ordered the Buffalo Bison burger and really liked it.  Great flavor and HUGE portions!  I had the Morty's Steakhouse burger and it tasted like steak.  Really, really, really good.  We both ordered the sea salt and herb fries instead of chips and they were fantastic as well.  Truly, after the chips and shakes, we took a few bites of burgers and fries then had to take the rest home for later!  I think for quality burgers like tgis, it's worth the price.  We will definitely go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"One of the better burgers I have had in Pittsburgh. 

Came here for a small event. The food was delicious and the hospitality was incredible. We all received 4 sliders and 3 milkshakes. My favorite milkshake was the S'mores - you could taste the graham cracker bits and it was delicious. 

Burgers were juicy and the toppings really worked with each burger.

The ambiance is great for any occasion. I loved this place!"}
{"text":"My wife, 1.5 yr old son and I visited on 7/3/2015 and here are our grades:

location: A, the Waterfront is safe and nice.

ambience:  A, not a dive

wait:  A, around 30 mins

staff and waiter: A, very nice people and excited about working 

shake:  A+, my wife got the s'mores shake.  best tasting shake to date.

appetizer: A, we got the gorgonzola fries.  very tasty and tasted good the next day.

chicken brest burger: B, i did the build your own burger options and was happy with the results.  

hambuger: C,  we loved their concept of creating your own burger!  However, it wasn't juicy or tasty.  For starters, they don't allow you to get your burger grilled medium well.  They only offer medium and well done.  My wife got her burger well done and it was dry.

Overall:  -B.  It was good but if you're only in Pittsburgh for a day or two, find another spot.  If you really want a good burger fix, try 5Guys."}
{"text":"not worth the money way overpriced for a hamburger....long wait times, atmosphere just okay..Not a fan favorite"}
{"text":"Cutesy hell-themed (kinda) burger joint.  Burgers are good, but not as good as they should be for the price in my humble opinion.  Great milkshakes."}
{"text":"We didn't wait at the beginning of Happy Hour and quickly got a booth for 4 in this small yet trendy bar is central with some booths and tables.

As it was Happy Hour - Yes - we quickly ordered a selection of the half off appetizers and drafts. Quite a deal

Beer - Yes - ever-changing selection of 12, some unusual.

Sliders - Yes - 3 - chicken, bison, beef - on delicious brioche rolls. These were the best thing we ordered. I would have wished each to have a different personality but they all had cheese and a pickle. We liked the chicken best and though the other two were slightly different we couldn't (nor could our server) tell which was which (note to Burgatory - put a different marker on one of them). Sadly they were a bit dry which may not reflect on the regular size burgers that we didn't try. I'm a toppings person when it comes to burgers to that decreased my enjoyment of the selections. A homemade pickles/toppings bar like Michael Symon's B Spot would be welcome. We should have stopped with just these. 

Mushroom Fries - No - as other reviews highlight the large battered portabello fries and I love mushrooms I was looking forward to but disappointed by these. I was pulling the batter off and then wiping copious grease off my fingers before trying to enjoy the plain mushrooms. Perhaps leaving the gills/underside of the large pieces makes the coating wet when it goes into the frier? Not sure but a mistake. And I love peanut sauce and could discern some peanut-y flavor - maybe from peanut oil - in the dip but I'd call the black thin sauce Asian or Soy or something other than peanut that I expect to be thicker and more peanut-y.

Side of fries - were fine.

Wings - these were okay. The skins were a bit rubbery but edible and tasty. We were disappointed though because they were called Siracha Wings which sounded awesome. We expected a spicy, hot and red wing. These were natural colored with a thin Asian style sauce and a sprinkle of sesame seeds and scallions. Far too mild for us.

I would go back if I were in the area to try the bigger burgers, the veggie burger, milkshakes and more drafts but I would not drive across town to go here."}
{"text":"I know there's always a debate as to which burger is the best in town...my pick, Burgatory!  Juicy, flavorful, and cooked perfectly!  It's not the closest to me, but it's definitely worth the drive to go to Burgatory.  

The setup is well done too!  Sometimes there can be a line, but their wait list system allows you to leave a number and shop while you wait!  And when it's time to order, they have an order sheet that allows you to select and document whatever your heart desires!

There's also a decent happy hour selection, but really, I'm there for the burger!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!  We started dinner with the Bangkok Steak Fries appetizer, which was really huge pieces of portabella mushrooms in a tempura batter.  Yum-o.  Then for the main event.  My husband ordered a burger off the menu (Morty's Steakhouse) and I created my own (cajun rubbed beef patty, smoked gouda, bacon, and BBQ sauce).  Both were flavor-packed and cooked to perfection!  We then finished off our meal with the Espresso Love milkshake.  It was soo tasty but we couldn't finish it all.  We wheeled ourselves out of Burgatory with smiles plastered on our faces.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We stopped by on a whim after driving across the state. The place was super clean and whimsical. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and helpful offering us Pittsburgh tips. My husband and I both thought these were the best burgers we've had in a long time--perfectly cooked, tasty. The waitress suggested a hard cherry cider which hit the spot. Our kids loved the bacon and cheese quesadilla and their burgers. Milkshake was good, but served with a little too much whipped cream on top. I wish we had one in our hometown. I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"I seriously want to eat there now, just thinking about it!! The specialty mixed drinks are decent if you are feeling adventurous, but save room for your burger. They are huge and delicious :)"}
{"text":"The food is always great and the service is always great!  The wait always seems to be a little less than what they tell you which is great.  They use a text messaging system for waiting  which is awesome, especially with kids.  Very kid friendly place. 5 stars all around"}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars I would. Seriously awesome food.  The create your own burger is the way to go! 

They also do take out, and it's just as good as eating in the restaurant.  My only complaint is that I wish they would keep cold food cold until you pick up your order (the kids meals come with carrot sticks and they're always warm).  Also, a little less salt on the fries. 

But seriously if you haven't tried this place out you're missing out"}
{"text":"Ate here on a Thursday around 7pm with my parents and two kids. About a 20 minute wait, which wasn't too bad (they said 20-30). Ordering proceeded smoothly, even though we'd never been here before and had to decipher the system, and the noise level was so high (loud music, huge room, high ceilings, concrete floors) we could barely hear each other speak. 

Drinks and milkshake (delicious) arrived promptly, but then things ground to a halt as we waited at least another half an hour for our food. There were some empty tables (although also people waiting), so it's not like they were packed. No one ever explained what took so long, though the waitress had an apologetic air when she finally delivered the burgers. 

The burger itself was great. I ordered it \"pink\" and it was exactly that. The garlic mayo was pungent but that's how I like it. Others at the table were satisfied with their burgers too. I just wish we hadn't been so drained by the long wait and the overwhelming noise level -- by the time the food arrived, we were all eager to just eat and get out. If it's always that slow (I assume it's always that loud), I doubt I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"As far as my dietary restrictions go, Burgatory is the easiest place for me to eat out. My other options are essentially limited to the Whole Foods salad bar and Chipotle (if I'm seeking convenience, cost-efficient, and easy to manage options), and Burgatory is easily the most bang for my buck.

I follow a paleo diet, so navigating main dishes is sometimes difficult. Here, I choose a sustainable source of meat, a lettuce bun, no cheese, and whatever toppings I'd like. I love the option of receiving greens on the side instead of chips. I feel satisfied without having to make two-three substitutions or sacrificing the volume of my food while paying more for extras like guac (i.e. Chipotle). 

In my opinion, this is the most health-conscious sit-down restaurant in Pittsburgh, and I'm glad there are multiple locations. I'm a Burgatory addict. I wish they'd come up with a dairy-free milkshake though..."}
{"text":"This place should be renamed Purgatory - the eternal wait!  Well, I'd like to review the food and drinks, except for the fact that we never sat down after waiting for 2 hours.  We knew that  with our party of 11, on a Saturday night on a holiday weekend that we should expect a wait.  We heard the buzz, liked the concept and were looking forward to having a little family reunion to eat, drink, have some burgers and spend some money!  We were patient, flexible and told the hostess we could split up the party.  We were initially told that the wait would be 60 minutes and that they would text us when our table was ready, so we thought that was great and went out and shopped for nearly an hour.   When we checked back at the 60 minute mark, we were told they had initially quoted 60-75 minutes, then the 3rd time we checked in, we were told that they said 75-90 minutes... What?!?!  During this wait we saw (4) booths in a row open up and a 4 top with (2) 2 tops next to it that could have been pushed together.  Finally, I asked to speak to the manager who was unhelpful and insincere.  Apparently only one table was designated for large parties.  Rather than compromise or use common sense, they chose to lose customers and business.  We walked around the corner to Five Guys and received excellent food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Decor was pretty fun and went well with the theme. They offered wagyu beef for hamburgers among other things. The wagyu was awesome and cooked perfect. I didn't care for the chips or baked beans. Server was nice but not too knowledgeable with the alcohol list. Over all it was a fun, tasty experience :)"}
{"text":"Let them get their kinks worked out.  I've been here twice and both times the service has been horribly slow.  One time was 11 30 am on a weekday before the lunch crowd got here.  Today it was130p on a Saturday and we still waited a while to get the food.  Today our buns were stale and again the service was slow.  The concept of burgatory is great, the execution in Monroeville has a long way to go."}
{"text":"I love coming here! At times it may extremely difficult to get a table because it so busy, but that is definitely not something that I believe should penalize the establishment. It really is a nice hip and trendy location that I believe the Waterworks was desperate for.

I really would love for more of these locations to open."}
{"text":"Burgatory has great food! The bison burger is definitely my favorite, along with various milk shakes. The prices are a little high though."}
{"text":"I just docked a star from my review of BRGR. 

There's a new sheriff in town, and he's telling BRGR to suck it. 

My brain is still spinning from so much awesome, so I'm going to have to enumerate everything I love about Burgatory. 

1. Someone at Burgatory stole my iPod and hit 'shuffle'. I spent as much time singing along as I did chatting with my friends. Either my taste is becoming progressively more mainstream as I get older or there are some very cool (and aggressively non-hipster, I hope) people in charge of the music.

2. Spiked milkshakes. Spiked Milkshakes. SPIKED MILKSHAKES. Heavens, what was I thinking when I foamed at the mouth over BRGR's? I wasn't thinking. I hadn't yet experienced Burgatory's Apple Pancake and Bacon shake. Did you absorb all the Awesome in that shake's name? Again: Apple. Pancake. Bacon. There's also alcohol in there, but it's almost secondary to the chunks of apple and bacon floating in the heavenly swirls of Happy. The whipped cream tasted homemade and worked surprisingly well with the slice of bacon (A SLICE OF BACON!) adorning the side of the glass. Oh, heavens. I'm having heart palpitations just thinking about how amazing it was. My friends' milkshakes were equally swoon-worthy: the bourbon and caramel soaked Grandad's Secret and the rummy banana goodness of Monkey Business.  

3. The menu burgers were insanely creative, and unlike BRGR, you can create your own masterpieces. A little gouda here, some Kona rub there; Cabernet sauce here, applewood bacon there. The possibilities are endless... and DELICIOUS. The only area Burgatory seems to fail is with well-done burgers. A little too dry. But not enough to take away from the overall experience. And even if the burgers totally sucked, the milkshakes would've made up for it. Seriously. I would go to the restaurant just to drink myself into ice-creamy oblivion. 

Word of warning: because Burgatory is still in its infancy, it gets packed very, very quickly. We waited over 75 minutes for our seats. And every minute was worth it."}
{"text":"Decent food, the milkshakes were pretty awesome. Super slow service though even after the long wait for our table to be cleared. Their build your own burger was cool."}
{"text":"Burgatory is okay. The first time I went here I made my own burger and got it to go. It took them a really long time and when I got home, I realized they left off some of the toppings that they charge extra for. :) 

The next time I went, I got tacos. These were delicious; however, the service was awkward. Our server would walk by our table, slowly, as if he was going to check in with us....but would just end up walking away. Lol! I also got to try a milkshake. The amaretto one had good flavor but the texture was off since the pieces of almond were a little large for a drink. 

Overall, I'm not really impressed with this place. It's fine, but there are better places. I prefer BRGR."}
{"text":"Nachos are out of this world and so are the burgers.  Great beer selection and oh I forgot ALMOND TORT milkshake :-0 RIDICULOUSLY delicious."}
{"text":"Moved from Bar Louie and experienced a total change! Great food & drinks, friendly and attentive staff"}
{"text":"I keep going and getting fooled by this place.  It looks like so much fun.  Their decor is witty and exciting but for me it ends there.  I have gone twice during lunch time and my burger was over cooked.  The meat was nothing better than the five guys that is right down the street.  Keep in mind I am talking about the meat as is.  It could be rat meat and you could put all the crap that is there on it and it would taste good.  The burger itself isn't worth the money.

Go to five guys.

Colin"}
{"text":"Burgatory. Aptly named as paying $40 for two subpar burgers and some limp, oddly flavoured potatoes sure made me feel like I was in hell. 

I'm giving you three stars to be fair, as I did order online and can't judge the dine-in experience."}
{"text":"Ok, yes I know the food is great and the milkshakes are literally knee shaking, but the host staff is terrible. The waiters and waitresses are fantastic, but the people greeting you at the door (you know the ones meant to keep you in the restaurant so you eat there) are terrible. We used the no wait app they use and had no problems we left with enough time to not be skipped over and when we arrived it said there was one party ahead of us. We checked in with the host and hostess and the host told me that we got there 53 minutes into a 45-60 minute wait so we expected to wait 7 minutes. 15 minutes and 4 parties (3 of which were 2 people parties like mine) later THE INCOMPETENT HOST LOOKS AT ME AND ASKS ME IF WE'D BEEN HELPED!!! We didn't leave, we didn't walk away, we were literally three feet from the host stand the entire 15 minutes. Trying to remain calm I said to them yes we came in 15 minutes ago to check in you told me that we were 53 minutes into a 45-60 minute wait and we had 1 party ahead of us yet you managed to seat 4. The hostess standing next to him rolled her eyes and asked us to follow her. The only thing keeping me from losing my cool was definitely the thought of the food. Our waitress was super nice though and everything else was great, but the host staff needs training or replaced. Their job is to keep people in their restaurant and with a five guys within walking distance they need to step their game up."}
{"text":"Really good food. Large menu selection. Very clean and wonderful, quick service. Only downside is that it is quite on the pricy side."}
{"text":"Expect to wait a little.   It is worth every minute.  It gives you a chance to absorb all the aromas.  

Be adventurous and create your own burger.  Try something new like Elk or Bison.  

Don't forget the Bankok Steak Fries.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My family and I were in Coraopolis when my father had business training. After the rest of us spent a day at the Pittsburgh zoo (and in awful city traffic) we picked him up and were at our hotel wondering what to do for dinner. We'd seen the billboard for burgatory along the highway and laughed at the clever name ( we've been known to visit restaurants because of their name many times) so I looked it up on yelp. I'm not sure why this location has fewer stars than the one in Pittsburgh, but don't head into downtown traffic if you're going to burgatory. Anyway, we wanted ice cream and had noticed that burgatory was famous for its shakes, so, being in a meaty mood, we opted to go there and get dessert there as well. Best decision of that whole trip, foodwise. It was less than ten minutes from our hotel, and easy to find in a small strip. The inside is decorated with a giant decision making quiz thing on the wall and red outlines of haloed and demon tailed cows (that sounds creepy, but it's not, I promise.) The hostess seated us right away, and a waitress arrived right behind her to take drink orders and explain the menu. As other reviewers have explained, each table has notepads on which you can mark your choices of patty, bun, sauce, dusting, cheese, and dozens of toppings to build your own burger. And not just as in one patty or two, american or swiss, but as in choose from beef, elk, crab, chicken, beef and bacon ground together, veggie burger. . . yeah. The menu lists several favorite in house burgers, one of which I got. It was the bacon and jelly and PB one, I forget the name. My parents shared the classic burger, and my brother got the kids burger, which is actually two tiny sliders. Everything comes with chips, but you can get their jalapeño cornbread, fries, side salad, or potato salad instead. They also have sandwiches and salads, but if you go here, it's a bit of a sacrilege to get anything  but a burger. Anyway, all of ours were phenomenal. I got the cornbread as my side, and it was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. And speaking of sweet. . . the milkshakes. I'm a bit of a milkshake addict. These hit the spot. They have several alcoholic flavors and several plain, all of them special creations you'll be hard pressed to discover elsewhere. Be warned: I ate my entire milkshake and three bites each of burger and cornbread. That's how huge the shakes are. Think old diner or soda fountain style, with the server bringing out the metal mixing cup with your whipped cream topped glass. I ordered the butter butter fluffernutter shake, my mom the salted caramel pretzel, my brother the chocolate chip cookie, and my dad just plain chocolate. They were all fantastic! The waitress was polite and attentive the entire time. The only itch was that the shakes were a bit slow coming out, and they mixed up my moms order. Other than that, this place was marvelous! Definitely go and get a shake - just be prepared to share!"}
{"text":"I've heard some good things about Burgatory and finally had the opportunity to try it last night. Since it was late on a Monday night there was no wait and we were seated right away, which was great. The staff were friendly, helpful and took their time with us...but I don't know if thats because it wasn't so crowded. 

The menu looked really interesting with plenty of options for finger foods, sides, burgers, and sandwiches. I would have liked to try more things but I HAD to order a spiked milkshake. I ordered the almond tort and it was SO GOOD. There was a ton of whip cream but I didn't think that was a bad thing. You could taste the liquor but it wasn't overpowering and I really enjoyed it. My friend got the non-alcohol nutella milkshake and that was delicious too. 

For my burger I ordered the Jerk Chicken one. I would normally just get a regular beef burger but this just sounded very interesting to me. It had jerk seasoning, pineapple, banana ketchup, and other toppings on a whole wheat bun. It was messy but pretty good. I think next time I would go for a beef burger. There was the option of building your own burger, which my friends took advantage of. Their burgers looked delicious and they had nothing but good things to say. 

I would go back and explore the menu a little better."}
{"text":"In terms of Burgers, this place gets 5 stars.

I have never had a better burger than their Elk burger, combined with crunchy iceberg lettuce, dill pickles, an egg, and the Truffle aioli.

I usually dont like chicken or turkey burgers, but this one is amazing as well.  I was completely shocked at how good it was when trying a bite of a friend's chicken burger.

The hormone free beef is simple and good as well.  Although, sadly, I cannot tell the difference between the regular beef and the Wagyu burger.

The baked beans as a side are tremendous.

Any bar that makes their drinks with fresh squeezed fruit is top notch in my book.

This place does it right."}
{"text":"I would have to say that Burgatory nearly lives up to it's reputation. While the food is on point, the restaurant could use a makeover. Walking in it, just has a confusing layout to it. Because of that, attempting to dine there is a very awkward and uncomfortable experience. This feeling might have been appeased if the restaurant had been decorated in an appealing way. Instead it is extremely dull; and gives you the feeling of being in a building that is in its final stages of construction. However, after choosing between the endless number of savory condiments and free toppings that are offered and after waiting a delightfully-short time, \"my creation\" arrived. With one look I could tell that I would have a meal for later, too. As soon as I bit into my burger, I understood why I always hear people talking about Burgatory. I would certainly call that burger heavenly. I would have to say that they take burger places to a whole new level."}
{"text":"I was traveling with my family on business and we stopped at this place before leaving town. All I have to say is wow, the burgers were cooked to perfection, our appetizer of chicken wings were cooked perfectly nice and crispy without being dried out. The music was a bit loud making it difficult to talk without feeling like I was shouting. The decor and over all feel of the restaurant was lively and up beat."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's become one of my favorites that I return to often. Never had a bad customer service experience here and we have a different waiter/waitress every time. They're always super friendly and helpful with the menu! Great drinks, shakes, and burgers, especially with their signature sauce. I just recently chose this place for my birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian and vegan options! The veggie burger is FRESH and delicious ! They offer vegan cheese which tasted great! They even have vegan milkshakes which tasted very good! Impressed with their ability to cater toward vegans being a burger joint. Also - excellent service!"}
{"text":"The absolute best burger I've ever had. Beef (rare) on a whole wheat bun with a cracked peppercorn and sweet onion rub, cheddar, applewood smoked bacon, Dijon mayo, sliced tomato and organic field greens. Heaven. Paired it with their herbed chips and pear hard cider. 

The place was crowded, the tables are close together, and it's a bit noisy but it's a burger joint so that's appropriate. Wait staff were attentive and fun. Looking forward to trying the Murrysville location."}
{"text":"It was a nice place, very clean. the food was great! service was a little slow but I guess that's to be expected in burgatory haha! It's defiantly the place to come if you want a burger. Just burgers though. And the bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place in Pittsburgh! Love that they use local produce. The \"Meet your Maker\" is my favorite there. The green salad is always fresh, and it's huge!"}
{"text":"Wow!!  A burger joint where the burgers taste as good as they look!  Finally had a chance to take the family for some shakes and burgers and the kids keep asking to go back!  Love all the different shakes and the flavor twists!  My son tried the mini-cheeseburgers and LOVED them.  I had a bite and was very impressed how the kids burger tasted - not a dried out round orb that they normally serve to children.  Burgers were cooked perfectly as requested.  Loved that you could build your own burger with really different options.  This will be our go-to dinner spot from now on!"}
{"text":"Such a good burger place.  I love a place that gives you options and they give you tons.  I chose their Buffaloaded Bison burger which was great.  They also have amazing shakes.  I got a hard shake and the liquor taste was a tad on the strong side, however, my friends caramel and pretzel shakes were delish.  I would highly recommend this place for some good times and good food."}
{"text":"Lots of mistakes on our order. So far very very slow services but many are standing around."}
{"text":"Good burger but expensive. Very skimpy on the extra toppings, ordered grilled onions for extra $ and did not even get one tablespoon on burger. Chairs are VERY uncomfortable!!"}
{"text":"Excellent shakes both hard and regular. My son let me try his Salted Nutella Crunch and it was easily the best shake I've had in years. The burgers were pretty good but the toppings seemed to just haphazardly slapped on my burger - two small slices of tomato stacked on top of each other. The onion rings were a big disappointment, five rings for $8 and the rings were slightly undercooked.

Verdict - definitely go if you like shakes and burgers but skip the onion rings."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this one but been to the one in Waterworks. If you live in Pittsburgh and haven't been to Burgatory do yourself a favor and slap yourself, then go to Burgartory. This place has off the chain burgers and shakes."}
{"text":"good service, but the food was not good, and I'm pretty sure the quinoa salad had spoiled---it tasted suspiciously tangy (agreeing was one of my companions)---but the restaurant insisted that's the way it is supposed to taste.  dubious."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave 5 stars was because the burger I ordered knocked my socks off!! Piggy Butter and Jelly: Cajun Dusted Ground Beef & Ground Bacon Burger with White American Cheese, Candied Bacon, Bread & Butter Pickles, Peanut Butter & Habanero Jelly.

OMG. I was skeptical, but man this burger was so good. 

I have no idea what else was going on in the restaurant because my burger was THAT good!"}
{"text":"Love the place. Even has good veggie burgers!! The best feature is you can customize the way you want your burger to be. Always a waiting but you can shop till you get a call."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in after a Pirates game, looking for a place to eat. We are from out of town and took a guess from yelp reviews. We had the honey habanero  wings a chopped chicken salad and a create your own burger. Everything was excellent and had so much flavor. Service was great food came fast drink were always full and sever was fantastic. The place had a cool vibe with the garage doors and the tv playing the pens game. Will be looking to stop back in the next time in town for sure. Great job Sam T."}
{"text":"Burgatory at The Waterworks is exceptional!  Great service and delicious food are a guarantee at this Burgatory location!  A few issues I have encountered at this location was when I was given chewy sweet potato chips that were not the freshest and the long waits.  A 40 minute wait is not something I particularly enjoy, but it's no wonder there is such a long wait because of the variety of milkshakes and burgers!  Other than those issues, Burgatory at The Waterworks has outstanding food paired with great service!"}
{"text":"Please don't have the servers come to the table every 7 min to see how I'm doing. And then if I do have a question please know the answer or at least say pardon meet I will find out. The sorry it's above my pay grade answer isn't helpful."}
{"text":"It's a burger joint. Menu doesn't change and I've grown bored with the burger combinations. Still a good burger, but my visits are a lot more spaced out now unless there's a peculiar new featured milk shake that caught my attention."}
{"text":"First our server Caitlin was very sweet and attentive. The peanut butter and habanero jelly burger is possibly the best burger I've ever had in my life. The truffle fries with Gorgonzola are phenomenal. Awesome experience. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Perfect. Literally the best burger I've ever had, and I'm from Texas. Nice atmosphere, smells great?! Clean and service was very friendly. I had the beef burger with Gouda, avocado and truffled shallot aoili. The custom burger menu is HUGE. My vegetarian friend had a great burger too. Don't feel like you need to get the expensive sides cause the house chips are KILLER. Definitely a great lunch place!!!"}
{"text":"Over-rated.  Some food features, such as shakes with alcohol, but burgers are so-so and menu doesn't have much else."}
{"text":"Get the \"meat your maker\"! You won't regret it. Extremely delicious burger! 

Don't get a shake and a burger, unless you're up for a quantity challenge. Both are great, but you'll be full faster than you can say burgatory."}
{"text":"The wait was so long. The front disk person was no nice and not welcoming. The food was good but over priced for burgers"}
{"text":"I created my own masterburger with bisonmeat (pink), fresh pineapple, spinage, lettuce and cheddar cheese. It was delicious!! Never had buffalo before, but this was a great introduction.

If you come here, you CANNOT leave without atleast one of their signature shakes! Too full, you say? Take it to go! 
...warm recommendations for the salty caramel pretzel-milkshake; it was thick, saltysweet and dangerously easy to finish. Next time, I'll give the S'moores a go."}
{"text":"After speaking with our friends about how exceptional this place was, hubby and I took a drive over to have lunch and then do some shopping.   By no means am I a connoisseur of gourmet hamburgers, but this really was a major disappointment.  My \"pink\" burger was so dry and tasteless that I only ate about a 1/4 of it and boxed the remainder for my dog.   Hubby ordered the \"Meat your Maker\" and he also said it was terrible.  I've come to realize that I'm just a Wendy burger girl myself, they are always so fresh and the fries are the best.  I really don't like the idea of all those different toppings, somehow they drown out what should be the main star---the Burger itself!   

Hubby also ordered the Bourbon milkshake but didn't care for all the whip cream that just wouldn't melt--it drowned out what should have been a delicious smooth drinking shake.  I'll take a Wendy's Frosty any day over this."}
{"text":"Best burger you'll find in Pittsburgh. Make sure to get as much on it as you can and get a milk shake! If you still can move after this meal you did it wrong, perfect burger, great shake and good fries! (The chips are good too but get the fries)."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was good...there was a 20 min wait but the milkshakes are worth the wait."}
{"text":"I went to the Burgatory in the waterfront I had a bad experience with the waitress and manager I ordered a alcoholic shake had proper I.d note I am 25 years of age showed it the waitress takes my order. Then comes the manager asking to see my Identification again I pulled it back out she asks do I have anything else with my name on it I pull my drivers license both issued by the state of Pennsylvania she the proceeds to say the photo doesn't look like me my nose and facial structure isn't the same???? Really I then pull a social security card out I feel this was very inconvenient for me to go through all this after me showing identification twice and three forms of it ."}
{"text":"This place serves the most delicious food every time!  We have tried the Waterworks and McCandless Burgatory restaurants, which are good, but always come back to this one.  The chefs are just a step above here.  Plus, as long as there are no events at PNC & Heinz Field, it's always more pleasant to visit this location.  My husband adores the Wagyu Burger (builds his own & I forget what he always get) and I love the ground chicken burger.  Every time I swear I'll try something new, but my mouth waters when I think of the ground chicken.  I get brioche bun, gouda, mushrooms and spinach and it is wonderfully delicious each time.  My kids' meals are also always delicious.  We always appreciate a restaurant that serves our children as quality a meal as our own and they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Wow, the Burgatory was fan-tastic!  I highly recommend.  Clean, good service and not outrageous prices for a good burger and sides.  Yeah, we'll be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  We've been here several times and always leave pleased.  I suggest making your own burger or the \"meat your maker\".  I usually do the bison meat but the wagyu is great too.  The fries with toppings are awesome.  Appetizers are huge and equally good.  We did find the chicken burger a bit of a let down but hey its a burger place.  

Our favorite milkshake is the carmel pretzel but on one or two occasions its been way too salty.  We asked and they happily replaced it.  The other milkshakes are great too and they can add liquor to any shake. Great beer list too (not huge but quality craft beers).  

One piece of advice is go early and/or with time flexibility.  They'll text you ten minutes before the table is ready so we usually go back home or do some shopping/people watching at Walmart."}
{"text":"Shakes are delicious and decadent. Burgers are really good, great toppings.  But I had the crab burger, and it was a food-service, previously frozen, tasteless and mushy disappointment.  Considering the emphasis on fresh and local, I expected better quality for a non red meat option. Stick to four-legged creatures and you'll be fine. We were there on a Thursday at lunchtime, and service was really slow."}
{"text":"The food is not bad but nothing to go crazy about. Plus in my opinion everything is well overpriced. Probably not going back since there is a ton of places around with better food and lower prices."}
{"text":"I really like Burgeratory. The food and drinks are good, prices aren't to bad. I am just alil disappointed by the wait time and the seating. You are so close to others. I have no problem with sitting next to people. ..but it's hard to have a conversation and some privacy. I would give 5 stars if seating was more spaced out."}
{"text":"On the road. Nice place, good vibe. Filling burger and the gorgonzola fries are amazing. Nice selection of beers. Will return."}
{"text":"They have every kind of burger you can possibly think of, very nice staff, and an overwhelming selection of milkshakes and beer. Not too expensive too."}
{"text":"We recently went to Burgatory and it was amazing.
  
I made my own burger creation which included the following:
Hormone Free Beef, Brioche bun, Sweet Onion Rub, Buffalo Cheddar, Habanero Jelly Sauce, Baby Spinach, Organic Field Greens, Arugula and Sliced Tomato with free chips on the side. And I love it!!! Most delicious burger ever!!! There was a sweet taste with a spicy sensation. Very unique taste! 

Also our server was friendly and helpful; however, the service was a bit slow since it was very busy and packed. 

Overall, I highly recommend everyone to try this place out."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I am no stranger to heavy meals and grease. I love bacon, fried anything, steaks, burgers, bone marrow, you name it. But my wife and I ate here today and halfway through our meal here we started feeling sick from all the grease. There were literally pools of grease underneath every burger, appetizer, chips, etc. The onion rings and the portobello fries especially were soaked, we only ate about one each of these, and I have never been known to moderate myself in front of a plate of fried items. We both built our own burgers and asked for them to be cooked medium. Mine came well done, hers came raw. I also ordered the Napa slaw, which was dry and bland but way too heavy on the black pepper (black pepper slaw?). The actual taste of the burgers was not bad, but we both left feeling pretty gross. **** Grossness alert ***** I actually went home and threw up and saw for the first time in my life an actual layer of grease/oil floating in the toilet. Ugh. 

I will say the service was good and the dining environment was not bad, on the upscale side for a burger place. But you certainly pay for it too, prices were fairly steep for not so upscale burgers and apps. 

Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Long wait...overrated food....way too expensive.  Tessaros is 100%  better."}
{"text":"Let me preface by admitting that I'm a tad over 60.

This restaurant is not my cup of tea because:

A) cramped and tight seating ... Too many tables in a small space... Don't want to be closer to people at the next table than with others in my party.

B) too noisy ... Found it difficult to hold a conversation.

C) no Guinness draft beer
 
If I do go back it'll be on a weekday when it's not as crowded."}
{"text":"Great burger.  I had a great burger.  Loud environment, could not hardly converse.  Pricey, we left with a $50.00 lunch for two.  The milkshake was super"}
{"text":"We've eaten at the Burgatory in Aspinwall many times so I was excited to see if the new location was as good. We weren't disappointed. It had everything we have come to expect. Our service was good, the Milkshake of the Day was awesome (strawberry pound cake) and our burgers were tremendous. We took two friends whom had never been and they were very impressed."}
{"text":"Another example of you just can't copy the original. The snobby hostess with the \"come as you are\" shirt is not an asset to this establishment. Maybe if you put a smile on your face and lost the entitled teeny bopper attitude you would be happy!!  As far as the food. Nothing like the original. Burger was bland. Won't be returning to this location. Message to management :  Hire people that want to be there and give quality service and serve quality food."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! I've been here a few times and was impressed every time. I'm sure the burgers on the menu are tasty, but the create-your-own is the way to go, especially if you like unique burgers and topping combinations. 

My favorite's the Bison burger with buffalo cheddar, garlic mayo, a fried egg, avocado, organic greens, and tomato. Tremendous combo!  I don't get the rubs, I feel like it's too much with all the other toppings. 

There is always a wait here, but I can't fault the place for being busy. I'm sure the Barnes and Noble right next door is very appreciative."}
{"text":"I called to order a milkshake which takes seconds to make but they refused to make it even though people were still there. Then the guy who answered the phone - hung up on me."}
{"text":"Freezing cold - air conditioner blowing on us when it's 50 degrees out. Told the waitress but not much she can do I guess. Also- don't order ranch on your burger ...  They won't put much on but will make you pay for more. Won't be back."}
{"text":"First time I went to burgatory I was hooked! Now I basically go there every Saturday love it!!!!!! they care about your nut allergies if you have them! very nice people! I even drove there in a midst of a snowstorm 10 out of 10. Man bun alert!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great. I had heard about it and was a bit skeptical as I'm a big fan of Tessaro's; and the create-your-own menu was a bit overwhelming initially. I mean, who am I to create my own burger? I didn't even know what half the toppings were. That said, once I calmed down and picked all my toppings, I was rewarded with an incredibly tasty burger. I also was a bit doubtful about the milkshakes that everyone had hyped. I was happily proven wrong. My shake was delicious as well. And the nachos: they were an absolute treat.

My only complaint is that there food is so good, and they give you so much, that it's almost impossible to eat it all!

Also appreciated that they text you when your table is ready. We were able to do a little shopping at local stores including Barnes & Noble while we waited.

A must try for anyone who like burgers or shakes. Even better if, like myself, you like both!

I can't give it a 5-star rating until I prove to myself that it is consistently great. At this time, I've only been here once."}
{"text":"All I can say is..... AMAZING!!! Burgersare obviously their thing, and should be because it was the best burger EVER! BUT- if you are going you MUST MUST MUST order the Truffle Gorgonzola Fries... T D F!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I have lived in Philly and good burger bars are a dime a dozen there so I probably have higher standards than most.  I give Burgatory an A for effort in that they definitely have some interesting choices with how to create a burger and their burgers are pretty good.  However, beers are overpriced and the wait is usually pretty long unless you can get there around 5-530 for dinner.  Plus it is in a strange location in a shopping center tucked back in a walkway area and it is a pain to get to if you are coming from town.  BRGR is very similar if you are in town and looking for a chic burger bar."}
{"text":"It's the best restaurant that I have ever eaten in. Close your eyes and put your finger on the menu, and I guarantee that every thing is gonna be delicious."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, the veggie burger is amazing! I love a burger place that has fresh options for vegans and vegetarians!"}
{"text":"This Burger Bar turned Haute cuisine presents meticulous preparation and careful presentation of food, at a minimal price level, accompanied by a great beer selection. Although the potato 'chips' given with every order are less than desirable, other side options are available. The Malt Shakes provided are a perfect compliment to any meal, and are eachly unigue. The service is fantastic! Waiters/Waitresses are well skilled on the menu and all of it's resultant combinations.
 ...It is in your best option to make reservations ahead of time, for an average dinner wait could set you back a good 45 minutes, but it is well worth it. Many people try to compare Burgatory with BRGR, which is a similar burger joint in Pittsburgh. Let me first say that Burgatory is alike only in the fact that it serves gourmet meat patties, but BRGR definitely surpasses the Haute quality on many levels. Overall, if you are desiring a good buger with the availablility of countless toppings, Burgatory is the best bet. The only gripe I hold, is that they do not have Blue Cheese or a Buffalo sauce, nor an option of a crispy grilled Foie gras. 8/10 ...Go Steelers.."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but after three visits I feel like I can confidently say that it is extremely overrated. So many of my friends rave about this place and I just can't see the appeal. Burgatory is overpriced and often has long waits. Unfortunately, the food doesn't justify the price or the wait.

While the burgers aren't bad, they certainly aren't anything special. Every single time I have gone to Burgatory there has hardly been any sauce on my burger.  I find it kind of ridiculous that they would charge someone for a side of sauce when really have to search the burger to see if there even is any. Since they charge for any extra side of sauce, ask for your burger with the sauce on the side. This way you actually get enough sauce for your burger and you can use the extra for your side. 

I actually did really like the Campfire Smores shake. However, this is the kind of restaurant that I would go to if all of my friends/family wanted to go, but that I would never suggest to go to. Honestly, there are quite a few restaurants that aren't \"burger-specialty\" with menus that still have quite a few burger options and they are much better. Time to try Fat Heads!

Tip: Use the NoWait app to reserve your table without going into the restaurant. This app is also a great way to figure out beforehand how long of a wait it will be"}
{"text":"The five stars are for the shakes , I dont eat burgers, I had the carmel pretzel and it was so good!! Big enough to share. It is a little to dark in there."}
{"text":"Good burgers and shakes, but a bit on the expensive side. I like the custom burger option, and that they offer the whole wheat bun. Had a pretty bad experience my first time here when ordering at the bar; I asked how long the wait would be for the food to be done and was told less than 30 minutes. So I waited patiently while eating the shake I ordered. When I asked where my food was about 10 or 15 minutes after I expected it to be done, someone went back to find out and brought it back cold. So I had to rush to finish my cold burger and fries before my lunch break time was up. It was a while before I went back after that bad experience, but my other experiences have been better."}
{"text":"Positives: The burgers are truly awesome.  I loved mine. Where else can you order a bison burger with your choice of extremely weird toppings.  It was divine and the portion size was just right.  The shakes, made with their own ice cream and served with an industrial-sized straw are thick and completely off the hook!  Order the burnt almond torte shake and you won't be disappointed.  

Negatives:  My husband, on the other hand, ordered the Burgatory version of a french dip and was extremely disappointed in the quantity of meat and the size of the sandwich--it was like ordering a sandwich and getting a child's portion of meat.  This menu item needs to be reconsidered.  Likewise, the inclusion of house-made potato chips with every meal.  The chips are nasty-- too thick, too hard and generally inedible.  I had requested sweet potato chips only and was told this was not an option because they mix them with the russets.  Honestly, they were so bad you couldn't tell which was which anyway.  The noise level in the place needs to be brought down.  Having a table conversation is like trying to make a phone call at a rock concert.  This can be easily remedied by turning down the volume on the speakers.  When you have to shout to place your order and the waitress still manages to flub because she heard inorrectly, it is a sign that something should be done."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town over the 4th and came here with friends for dinner that Sunday night. Had a great meal. The burgers and sides were delicious and shakes amazing. Despite a very long wait our wonderful hostess kept us informed and entertained while we waited which is important when you have kids with you. Will definitely come back on my next trip to the Burgh."}
{"text":"First of all, the chairs are painful. Too small. Legs don't allow room to get comfortable. (There were potato chip crumbs on the chair we weren't using.) It's very loud and the music doesn't know what genre it wants to be. The menu isn't appetizing. The \"create your own\" menu is annoying. It's like an airline. A buck if you want this. A buck and a half if you want that. The chips will take a tooth out if you're not careful. But the overpriced burger? Just okay. You might get a serving tray that isn't warped. Mine was. You couldn't fork a fry without the damn thing spinning like a top to get away from you. I can tell my friends I went there, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This location is never too crowded and food is consistently delicious.  Portions are large enough to share.  I'm always happy to eat here."}
{"text":"Ever since I learned to make Juicy Lucys, I haven't been tempted to try out the high-end burger joints like BRGR or Burgatory.  Doesn't paying $13 for a fancy schmancy wagyu burger seem akin to paying $100 for designer jeans?  Well, I actually have a couple of Lucky Brand Jeans, so let's get this review going!

I had a great meal!  A bucket of truffled gorgonzola fries?  Yes, please.  \"Unbelievable,\" was uttered.

The Meat Your Maker, a wagyu burger, was as advertised.  I was pretty skeptical of the Make Your Own Burger approach.  I thought it was a gimmick: No, sir, if I wanted to make my own burger, I would have stayed home! But, there are 5 to 12 options for meat, buns, cheeses, rubs, sauces, and condiments .  These are all high-end, gourmet condiments (e.g., Kona Rub, truffled shallot aoli, aged gruyere, avocado wasabi) and you can really create a fantastic burger to your liking.

I shared, reluctantly, the Nutella milkshake.  It is enough for two, and it was a great desert.  There's nothing like an old-school, new flavor milkshake.

So how many calories are we at now? 5000? No worries, I just took an extra Lipitor and Aspirin when I got home, after I popped the button on my Lucky Brand Jeans.

Burgatory exceeded BRGR in terms of tastiness, ease of parking (at the Waterworks Mall), kid-friendliness, and overall service.  If you're deciding where to go, choose Burgatory (Lipitor and Aspirin not included)."}
{"text":"Burger was really good but fries were terrible. Cold, limp, and flaccid. The guy at the PNC baseball park box office cautioned us that the fries were bad when asked about the place. He was right. We even ordered them extra crispy."}
{"text":"In just the past month, I ate in this establishment at least 10 times. As a burger reviewer, I have tried so many burgers in my life, nationally and internationally, as well as trying almost every major burger restaurant in Pittsburgh. Burgatory has just taken their burgers to the next level, making the best burger I have ever eaten in my life. I literally become addicted with their Morty's Steakhouse burger. The peppercorn crosted beef patty, medium cooked, makes me enjoy every bite. Honestly, whenever I feel like eating a burger, every other place seemed bad to me compared to Burgatory, so I'd rather spend my money on Burgatory, which is why I come here a lot. Not only their burgers are fantastic, but also their service is just so great. As a heavy Soda drinker, I always rate my server and determine the tip based on how many times I get my soda refilled without asking. With this concept, I would rate ALL their servers 5/5 because I have never came out of this place without drinking at least 3 cups without asking. In fact, they usually refill my cup before I even finish it. A combination of delicious food and great service is what this place all about."}
{"text":"The burger and shake were awesome. The shake was grandpa's secret or something like that with bourbon. I really recommend the shakes here. However, the place was very crowded when we got there. Especially because it was a time that movie séances has just ended. We had to wait for 20 mins to sit down and the server took a long time to bring our food."}
{"text":"Not a bad burger place due to the variety of options. They have burgers made from various animals such as bison, elk, veggie and others. I ordered the potluck dinner burger which came with pot roast, cheddar, onion straws, and horseradish cream on a Kona crusted burger (supposedly a slight coffee crusting which I did not detect at all.) It came with their house made chips. 

The burger had a good, natural flavor that actually stood up to the huge amount of toppings and various flavors. This was a good thing. The pot roast added little flavor but the sauce and cheese was good. The chips were average but you did get a lot of them as a side. 

Overall the food was good but I did drop the rating due to the service. Our waitress at lunch had no idea what was on the menu. We asked a couple of questions since it was our first time there and she admitted she just started a few days ago and has never ate their. FYI to management, you have to train your staff! Have them sample the menu or at least be able to describe it!"}
{"text":"Update: we stopped in for happy hour, which has to be one of the best in the city.  Half price appetizers and beers, and only $5 for their house cocktails.  Considering their portion sizes, you can fill up real quick and have to pay almost nothing for it! We had the nachos, truffled Gorgonzola fries, a strawberry shag and a few drafts.  Everything was AMAZING."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  If you haven't been to Burgatory yet, you're missing out on the best burger (and shake!) in the burgh."}
{"text":"Ridiculous wait (45 minutes) only to watch several patrons walk in to get near immediate seating. When asked, \"we have no reservations or call ahead seating\" per the iPad riveted hostesses. When pressed, \"well you could download the NoWait app to check in.\" \"Isn't that called a reservation or at least a call-ahead seating?\" I was derisively told \"no, it's an app?\"

In my opinion the food was at best mediocre and over-priced (10 hamburgers on the menu with average price of $11.40).

We received heavy pressure from wait staff for \"upgrades\" ... from the chips which come along side of these $11.40 burgers (chips appeared made in house and were grease-laiden and burnt) as well as for milkshakes and appetizers.

$8 milkshakes; to quote Pulp Fiction, \"that better be a good shake\" (in this movie, that was for a $5 shake.)

I have had the good fortune to travel throughout the states to eat at the complete spectrum of eateries. Burgatory for me, does not make the cut. There will be no return visits."}
{"text":"Don't get it twisted - a strip mall resty can be the bomb.com. The wait was excessively long, but not surprising due to the lack of seating. The Oktoberfest beer? Hell to the yeah. I can't help but mention that the hostess is a miserable, poorly dressed troll. You should feel blessed to not be seating me at Golden Corral. Black full bottom underwear with a white pleated skirt. EL OH EL. Marg? Yum. Get eight. Great server - attractive, knowledgable, and personable. I love a drink and this place knows their stuff. (My reviews are super lackluster without my peppered swearing, but you'll deal.) Bison burger!!! Duh! Not exactly heart healthy but you can stick your toothbrush down your throat if you feel so inclined. Ginormous cookie? Creaming myself. Oh, and if you don't ask for Marie to serve you then don't exist. Eating at her boyfriend's place next, Meat and Potatz. Seriously worth waiting. Patronize this ish or tie your neck to the rafters - just don't leave your wife with ten million in debt."}
{"text":"Went to Burgatory a couple days ago! Burgers were delicious and cooked just the way you like them. I chose to create my own and it came out just right. Our waitress was very helpful and able to provide suggestions to help guide us in picking our meal. The only negatives I would say we ordered Onion rings as an appetizer and they were a little greasy. Granted the place was busy but service was slow. We were waiting a while before our burgers were served."}
{"text":"Went to Burgatory for the first time last week when my mom came to visit and my burger was delicious. I got a ground chicken burger and topped it with gouda cheese, lots of veggies, and some chipotle mayo and it was delicious. The hamburger itself was to-die-for and I loved the fact that my burger came with homemade potato chips as well. My mom, who isn't really a burger person, also loved her meal. We will definitely be back again and next time I'm trying one of those delicious-looking alcoholic milkshakes! ;)"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Shoulda went to 5 guys.  How are your choices for burger temps red, pink, or no pink???  I ordered pink it was def rare.  20$ for a burger and a beer is way too much! Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"When I'm going fast casual and thinking of a burger, I'm a Five Guy kinda guy. So I'm happy I wandered out of my comfort zone and into Burgatory. 

Like other yelpers stated, the wait for a table is long. We were quoted a 45-minute wait ... on a Sunday at 2pm! But don't let this deter you from going; it takes some work to get into Heaven. There a ton of stores located around this space and they have an incredible texting system that alerts you when your table is ready and you can check in to their site and see how many guest are ahead of your spot. While we waited, we went to Wal-Mart and did our weekly grocery shopping and return with only 4 people ahead of our spot on the list. 

The hostesses weren't overly friendly like noted by other yelpers, but who cares? I'd sacrifice a manufactured smile for efficiency any day. It's a daunting task seating this many needy guests and you got to stay focused. With that said, I didn't know there was a bar at this location until we were seated! If we were told so when we checked in, I'd of elected to drink away our wait than shop for groceries.

On the other hand, our server, Marisa, was very personable and friendly. For as busy as she was I was amazed at her attention to detail and she seemed genuinely determined to enhancing our experience. 

I got the Morty's Steakhouse burger - peppercorn and horseradish are two of my favorite things. I ordered it medium rare or 'pink' as Marisa confirmed. Unfortunately, it came out well done. If this had occurred at Tessaro's or any restaurant above fast casual, the burger would have been sent back. However, It's my feeling that these fast casual establishments don't want to cook a medium rare for a myriad of reasons. At an establishment like this you tend to sacrifice quality for convenience. With that said, it was the best damn well done burger I ever had... dry, but good. 

As a side I received cold, hard sliced potato chips. I got the feeling due to the high volume of business they were fried well ahead of time and I got the bottom of the pan. But, I shouldn't even be eating them, so no harm. I hope when I return to Burgatory they will offer an alternative, non-fried side like potato salad or coleslaw, especially for the summer season. You can only have so much sin, which leads me to.....

Heavenly Shakes! Before we even ordered our burgers, it was determined what milkshakes we'd be ordering to-go. This is the way to go... eat your burgers there, skip the fried sides, and take a milkshake home! I got the Carmel Pretzel and my friend got the Coffee & Donuts. Just amazing.

Four stars may seem generous for a burger place that couldn't even cook the right temperature for a burger, but Burgatory exceeded my (low) expectations. From top to bottom, the menu is creative and original. This is a well-run business that put much thought and effort into guest convenience and enhancing their experience."}
{"text":"This is truly the best burger and fries I've ever had!!!  It's so good that I can't even eat at other burger places any more!"}
{"text":"I am sure that because they are packed, they do not need to do anything about customer service before you are in the seats. They accept no reservations and no call ahead for putting your name on the list, so when you have a large family, it's impossible to go there for anything at a normal eating hour. Burgers are my kiddo's favorite and I would have loved to treat him to it after a celebration for him, but the wait on a Saturday was 1 hr. 45 min. No, thank you. Moral of the story, if you have something special going on and want to treat the crew to lunch or dinner, especially on the weekend, you might be better of going somewhere else. Definitely, if you are a party of 6-9. 

Having been there before, I knew the food was good. It's a little different, and worth trying if you are a small group at an off time."}
{"text":"I remember once upon a time--about, oh, five years ago--when I lived in a typical New England college town.  A few months before I graduated, the most fabulous, incredible, mind-blowing restaurant showed up (or at least the most fabulous, incredible, mind-blowing restaurant since the cookie-&-doughnut delivery place Sugar Jones).  It was aptly called Fatso's, the premise was custom-built burgers & fries (and oh, the fries...), & it forever ruined me by giving me the ultimate discriminating veggie-burger palate.  No more bland TVP patties for me.  I demand the best.
Thanks to Fatso's, every single veggie burger I've tried in the 'Burgh has been a disappointment.  D's is good, but not great.  Double Wide: consistently a letdown.  Even Quiet Storm couldn't cut it for me.  But Burgatory rocked.  My.  World.  Maybe it was the two half-price drafts I downed in 30 minutes to take advantage of the awesome happy hour special ($3.00 Rogue!!!!!).  Maybe it was the mere thought of the grilled mushrooms & fried egg on my burger to come.  But after one bite, I was smitten.  Well-textured with added flavor from nuts, balanced spices, & the fantastic grain mustard & garlic mayo topping my roll, this veggie burger now holds a special place in my heart as my favorite.
All in all, great veggie burger, great happy hour, good shakes, & leaps and bounds better than the other restaurants (Fuel & Fuddle, Uncle Sam's, Joe Mama's) owned by the same purveyors."}
{"text":"Superbly decent. Went in with a bad attitude and came out greatly satisfied after building a magical burger."}
{"text":"Try the custom made burger
But you need to ask the waitress about the rubs as they give them nick names"}
{"text":"Went here this evening and it was very good although the milkshake was probably better than our burgers. And the waitress didn't have a very good attitude and acted like we were bothering her. We tried to tell her our burger order instead of filling out the create your own checklist and it seemed like that annoyed her. Other than that, it's a decent place."}
{"text":"Pretty good milks shake with decent burgers! Also the using of NoWait is absolutely cool!"}
{"text":"Came here because of the raving reviews of friends, and even people I don't know just hearing Burgatory in the conversation. Unfortunately the place did not live up to its hype... At least for me.  

I came here with a friend as we were in the area, it was probably around 9 or so and the restaurant was empty, just a few people at the bar watching the Penguin game.

Looked over the menu (obviously getting a burger) looked at the selection and was impressed with the types of meats, decent toppings but not as unique as i imagined they would be.

So i got the \"Meat You Maker\" mostly due to the Wagyu beef. Came out pretty quick, probably because we were the only people eating.

Now there was nothing wrong with the burger (was a bit on the dry and over cooked) but it was not good enough to rave about endlessly like everyone in Pittsburgh loved to do. Asked my companion and she was not wowed either.

Food aside the waitress clearly wanted to get out of there and left the bill a minute after our burgers arrived... Then kept coming around to check if we had paid, even though the restaurant want closing anytime soon.

Overall i give it a 2.5 stars rounded up to 3.  Is it good yes but it is not worth all the hype that is associated with it."}
{"text":"Look, if you haven't been here yet and you are contemplating it...just go. From the appetizers...to the fries...to the burgers...to the shakes...hell, even the water is amazing here.

But seriously, if you really want to enjoy a night out and have some delicious food, just go. 

**Use the No-Wait app to put your name in prior to leaving. The only thing you may be disappointed with is the wait (because it is that great.)

Finally, my favorite shakes in order, if you're questioning which to get:

1) Salted Caramel Pretzel
2) Fluffer Nutter Butter
3) Coffee & Donuts
4) Choco's Taco (without alcohol)
5) Salted Nutella Crunch
6) S'mores 

(And S'mores is still absolutely amazing...)"}
{"text":"So this is a new chain in pittsburgh. I have tried them before and liked it. 

Service was really good and fast. Got a good burger with blue cheese and onions. I liked it and liked that you can build any kind of burger that you want. 

I was with four other people and we all did the same thing. I like how you order with a pad of paper. Just like you are getting sushi. 

Will go back again."}
{"text":"The burgers are not very good, and they nickel and dime you on the toppings. Why do things like grilled onions cost an extra dollar??

I came here absolutely starving after not having eaten for a day and my best description of the burger is \"meh.\" Overall not a good sign. Really, just go to BRGR in East Liberty instead."}
{"text":"Today was their 1st day open and it showed. The burger was very average and it  took way too long to get. I'll give  it a few weeks and then try it again. Hopefully they get the kinks out by then. Atmosphere was nice.  Good luck Burgatory your going to need it with 5 guys beside you."}
{"text":"The family ate here for the third time today so I feel like I have given this place plenty of chances. The food is good, but the service is sub-par at best.  EVERY time I was here we were suppose to get a text message when our table was ready, it never happened anytime. When I finally complained  this time, after tables that arrived after us were seated, I was seated right away with a quick \"sorry\" .  It is EXTREMELY loud so much that my 6 year old said so.  It is pricy, but I have never been mad at paying for a good meal with great service. However this will be our last time here.  The bottom line is that if you want a pricy good burger, to not being able to hear your date across the table, with a wait no matter the time of day and then sub-par service than this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"The hostess staff certainly are not the mostest! They clearly do not care about the customers and have people sitting behind you, next to you and basically on top of you if they sit you next to the bar area. I asked to be moved to open tables due in part to allergies and other part to actually be able to have a private conversation but was told no and that we would have to go back to the wait list as this was our assigned table! The food is really good and our sever was excellent but if you want to be comfortable and have conversation with your company stay away as the seating stinks!"}
{"text":"In town for the Pitt Penn State game. Our daughter is in the Penn State blue band. Wanted something to eat so we checked the hotel guide book. Burgatory was close by. Our waitress Jennifer was extremely friendly. She explained the menus for us since we never ate there before. We had milkshakes with alcohol. They were very good and they were very filling. We ordered onion rings that were huge and delicious. The sauces that came with them were a little spicy. We also custom ordered burgers. We picked everything from the buns the meat and the toppings. They were some of the best burgers we ever ate. The staff were all very friendly and they kept the restaurant very clean. Highly recommend Burgatory."}
{"text":"Simply the best burger joint I have ever had the pleasure of visiting. The food was top notch, the milkshakes are awesome, and the service was second to none."}
{"text":"Holy &@;!... Best burger EVER! (Sorry about the language)

Burgatory is an absolute must if you're in the Pittsburgh area. I've eaten at several of their locations and the food, service, and atmosphere were all consistently great. The biggest drawback is that the servers are so good I'm compelled to leave larger than usual tips!"}
{"text":"Crazy good shakes and kicka$$ gourmet burgers. What's not to like...?"}
{"text":"Someone needs to tell Burgatory that salads usually have lettuce in them. Ordered the Grace salad, what i got was a whole sliced up tomato, with some onions and goat cheese on top. Burger was pretty damn good though, but a bit smaller than imagined"}
{"text":"If you are craving a great burger, this is the place to go! We also had milkshakes which were fantastic. Be careful with the \"Build Your Own Burger\" option because some of the toppings cost extra (which it does clearly say on the order form) and it's easy to turn a $9 burger into a $15 burger. Our entire group was very happy with the food and service and will definately be going back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Burgatory quite a few times with my daughter and her friends. I almost always order a burgers even though I rarely eat red meat. These are just too good to pass up! You can order different condiments, cheeses, vegetables (lettuce, tomato, avocado, etc), sauces, etc., and really customize your burger. They also have veggie patties if you prefer to skip the meat. I can't remember what is in them, but they are a tasty alternative to a red meat burger. They also have great salads. We shared a peppercorn caesar salad and the contrast between the hot kick of the peppercorns and the smooth, almost sweet dressing was fabulous. The chicken chili is another good option for something lighter than the burgers. 

Besides exceptional burgers, this place is known for its milkshakes. I've never tried one with alcohol but my friends raved about them. I've had a few of their non-alcoholic milkshakes and they are super thick, rich, with lots of flavor--the chocolate milkshakes are especially yummy! 

If you try to get in here on a Friday or Saturday evening, be prepared for a very long wait. I'm not a big advocate of waiting long for a table, so I try to hit this place during less popular hours."}
{"text":"Good burgers (fries are sometimes a bit flat) and great spiked milkshakes. Fast service for how busy they are."}
{"text":"What's not to like about Burgatory? Customizable burgers with almost endless options, healthy alternatives, and to die for milkshakes! We are big fans of this place. Considering we normally don't do chain restaurants, this is high praise indeed!"}
{"text":"Love the build your own burger concept.  Food is great, but milkshakes are better!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. My wife and I have been here twice with our daughter, who has three visits as a result...lucky girl. We have never had to wait and our last visit together was perfect to \"wait\" for the start time for a movie we wanted to see on a rainy day. The portabella mushroom (Bankok Steak Fries) appetizer is great and our daughter, who is not a big fan of mushrooms, likes these. My wife and daughter have created their burgers each time. They have gotten shakes both times and I got one this last visit...it was one named after the Samoas® girl scout cookie and was very good. I have ordered MORTY'S STEAKHOUSE burger both times and enjoyed it both times. Sha got the smores shake this time and it was great. The large marshmallow on top could used as a pillow ;). We all look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Good selection of burgers. Love the fact that they have a build your own menu. I was impressed by the fact that they offer beef, chicken, elk, bison, and even crab. Price is going to be on the average of $10-12 a person. Only huge kicker for me is a beer for $8. Didn't know I was at Yankee stadium."}
{"text":"We went to burgatory for dinner. My party was 2 50's and 2 80's in our group. When arriving they told us 45 minutes to one hour. After agreeing to wait, we were sitted in less than 10 minutes. The food was good. We're we being profiled at the door, are they searching for a younger crowd. Patrons beware of this practice."}
{"text":"Burgatory is amazing!  We go every time we make a trip to Pittsburgh! We went today and our waiter was Jacob. He was awesome!!  The food was awesome! The shakes are awesome!!!  Super awesome place!"}
{"text":"Jimmy apparently the \"district manager\" himself told my fiancé and I that they were closed when we arrived at 10pm even though their hours stated they are open until 11pm we are regulars at the murrysville and waterfront location and haven't been disrespected so much. The north shore location is HORRIBLE. They told us they are owned by the same people so if I'm going to be disrespected by an apparent district manager I will make sure my family and I will no longer conduct business with Burgatory I work with many customers and refer their business as one of best burger places in town but no longer!!! Absolutely horrible do not recommend the north shore location at all!!! Horrendous customer service!"}
{"text":"One of my go to places! Place has great staff and amazing food ! I love how the staff will remember your order when your a regular even the specifics on how we like it to be prepared ! Either it being a tough day, celebrating a special event or just looking for somewhere to grab dinner you can always count on burgatory in murrysville :)"}
{"text":"Have to admit that the first time I was there, I was somewhat unimpressed. I guess that nothing with the food stuck out. Honestly I remember more about the milkshake I had than the meal I ate. Great variety of the different kind of shakes you can get, but the food was good...not great."}
{"text":"I had the Bison Burger and it was fantastic. Atmosphere was good and the server was very attentive. The only thing that made me give it 4 stars were the fries. They weren't crisp and were a bit soggy. The free chips would have been a better option."}
{"text":"When for lunch with a grouo of co workers.  The service was excellent.  The milkshake was unbelievable!!!!  The burger was good.  Not a fan of the chips/fries.  Inwould go back just for the milkshake."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere! Really good food!! Even VEGETARIAN friendly!! My husband and I shared the coffee and donut milkshake (let's not count the calories) amazingly good! But the truffle and Gorgonzola fries... To die for!! So good, a must!! We both had the veggie burger, really good! But next time I'll get it on a different bun. I've also tried the crab cake burger and I prefer that over the veggie! Our server was great, up beat and really nice. The price is average and I think good for the quality of food. Over all a good time!"}
{"text":"Great shakes, great options when looking for a burger. Chili very underrated! Pretzel Carmel shake is probably the best Milk Shake I have ever had in my life. Buffalo Burger Fantastic , and lean."}
{"text":"Good spot for a quick burger and fries. We had the Greed and Envy burgers, both of which were tasty. Fries are great!

Friendly staff and good atmosphere. 

Would visit again."}
{"text":"I tend to prefer thin, sloppy burgers (e.g., Shake Shack) to thick burgers, but this was good for a thick burger. I don't understand serving burgers without fries, though. Burgers and fries are like peanut butter and jelly. Don't give me chips with my burger and then upcharge me for a burger's natural companion.

The milkshakes make up for it though!!! Tip: unless you have the biggest appetite on earth, either split a milkshake with someone or split a meal. I ALWAYS finish my food and could not finish my burger, fries, and milkshake. Maybe that's why they serve chips instead of fries. Hmmm, interesting. I still don't approve."}
{"text":"I loved the Burgatory in waterfront but the Burgatory in Murrysville was terrible. We called ahead and still waited two hours to be seated. Our food took 40 minutes to come and the orders were wrong. One of the \"corrected\" orders, the bacon was cold and not cooked. Staff was very rude."}
{"text":"I just had dinner there and it was amazing. The customized burgers/chicken are my favorite and they have vegetarian offers as well. It's all build your own and you really can't pick anything wrong. I had a Bison burger I'm not big on ground beef so this was a great option for me. The bbq rub and sauce are really good with the grilled pineapple on it! I didn't get a shake because I was entirely too full from the burger but that's on my to do list. This place is awesome! Not a single complaint from me!"}
{"text":"Food and bartenders are awesome! Go see Jane at the bar. She is an incredible bartender with lots of personality and knowledge about what's good to eat. Clean and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Simply stated this place was FANTASTIC! I won't go into my history, but I know burgers! People, trust this review, this was a hit. Service was great, the food was very tasty. If you want McDonalds that's fine. If you want a quality, fresh burger....go here.
I am amazed that 5 guys has any business being so close to Burgatory and I like 5 guys. This place is worth every $. Even the milkshake was incredible! Damn!"}
{"text":"Tip: call ahead of time or set up a table early and go walk around the wait time is always crazy. Me and my gf just put our names in then they text you when your table is ready. Now onto the food it was amazing at a decent and competitive price. I loved the build your own burger and my gfs burger was amazing. If you aren't into potato chips make sure to ask for fries because that's what they come with. The cost for two burgers water and a shake was 32$ so not bad for a big burger and a lot of food."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Worth the wait for us, but we went at an off time.  The place was still packed.  Alcoholic milkshakes, humongous burgers.  Very tasty reason to take a statin."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday, a Sunday afternoon, around 3:00. We were seated right away, but the place was packed!  It was a tight squeeze between tables and my husband was uncomfortable in his chair; I was seated on a long bench. 
Our waitress came and was very friendly. She got our drink order and offered assistance since it was our first time. She came back a couple times offering help before I finally decided what I wanted. I made my own burger- beef and bacon on brioche and various toppings. I also got a salted caramel pretzel shake. 
The shake came out first. Although I don't normally order drinks I have to chew, it was pretty tasty. For being \"known for their shakes\", they didn't really have a large selection. If we were to return, I don't think I'd order another. I think Steak 'n Shake and many other places are better than Burgatory shakes. 
The hamburger I got was pretty amazing. They fixed it just as I had asked and it tasted good. 
All in all, I'm not sure we'd go back - mostly because we live more than an hour away and there are lots of other places to explore. If we lived in the area, we would return."}
{"text":"What's not to like about this place other than the long wait times? Very creative and near perfect execution. Only slight complaint is meat usually too done for my liking, but I prefer my beef walk to the table after a quick tatoo from the grill. Flavor still topnotch. Nice to stumble on a place in the burgh that cares about quality. They could hold their even own in Houston & Austin."}
{"text":"I recently discovered two great reasons to eat here: The burgers are delicious, and the staff is super friendly and upbeat. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place. New construction, clean and friendly staff. Great burgers made anyway you want! However the best thing on the menu (in my legal opinion) is the Harvest Salad with Chicken and Avocado (ask for it to be chopped up). It's just Jesus!"}
{"text":"Great for kids and for making you feel like a kid again. Milkshakes are big enough to share, too."}
{"text":"Obviously the burgers are banging. It's the premier place to have a high class burger, which is my favorite food. 

With the burgers we had the sriracha chicken wings and steakhouse mushrooms. The wings were tasty and had a sweet and spicy sauce on them. Reccomended. The mushrooms were underwhelming.  Big slices of portobello mushrooms in thick, heavy beer batter. (I didn't know they'd be cooked like that) the mushrooms were lost in the batter which was a big grease ball without taste of its own. 

If you can stand the wait to get in, get yourself down to burgatory. Just don't order the mushrooms. ; )"}
{"text":"I went to Burgatory on a Tuesday night with some coworkers for a little get together because I'm moving out of the state and wanted to go to one last time before I leave. I've been to the other locations, always had a pleasant experience, good food, nice servers, and tasty drinks. Each time I've gone to Burgatory I've had a 30 minute to an hour wait. We arrived at 6:45 or so and the hostess said it was about an hour wait. We got on the list, but due to being hungry we decided to drop in for food at a nearby restaurant and come back to Burgatory for drinks. When we got our text that the table was ready we walked over and were seated immediately. The waitress arrived and asked for our drink orders and I told her we probably we're just going to stick with drinks tonight. She went and got some water and came back to take our order. Before taking it she responded by asking how long we waited for a table, and then followed it with a not so tactful suggestion that we could have got millkshakes to go, and that next time we could do that, and that we could get them to go right now. She then preceded to ask us if we wanted to still eat in the restaurant. Well, I didn't know I'd really put Burgatory out by coming in on a Tuesday night just for drinks. Sidenote at that point after her not so warm welcome the idea of leaving was pretty tempting, however those adult milkshakes cannot be taken to go.

Anyways it spoiled my mood, here I had wanted to have my last Pittsburgh hurrah at one of my favorite restaurants and right away we were met with an attitude. Now I know servers have difficult nights and heavy loads, so who knows what the deal was and maybe it wouldn't have happen again.

I just wished it would have been more welcoming and that the server had not insisted on taking the cocktail menu after we ordered. We got the idea and we took took round elsewhere. But Burgatory, that experience really bummed me out."}
{"text":"The veggie burger is heaven...and the truffle fries don't hurt anything either!!!!! I think the Campfire Shake might be the best milkshake I've ever had."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Burgatory. We came in at about 6:00 on a Friday night, and while it was really busy, we were seated in the time frame that they initially told us we would be.

I had a bison burger on a whole wheat bun with mixed greens, arugula, smoked gouda, onions, whole grain mustard, and bread and butter pickles with the side salad instead of the chips. The burger was incredible, and I was really impressed that the side salad was just as amazing as the burger.

My friends both got the Phat Pattie's Veggie Burger with the fries, which they loved. 

We shared two milkshakes among three of us- one peppermint pattie hard milkshake, and one caramel pretzel. Both were divine.

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have heard of Burgatory from friends so I knew I needed to try it when I came to town.   I made my own Wagyu creation and it was excellent with horseradish cheddar. 

You have to go and try it."}
{"text":"I would give all of the Burgatories a 5. Best burger in Pittsburgh, hands down. This one is less busy than the original locations but still be prepared to wait. 

Spoiler alert: it's worth it."}
{"text":"Came here with husband and bonus daughter while on vacation. Love the texting when your table is ready concept. 

The shakes are very yummy and incredibly filling. I got the expresso one. my husband the caramel bourbon and the 8 year old got the Smores. The Smores one comes with a roasted marshmallow on top! You get your glass of shake with tons of think, almost Fluff-like whipped cream on top plus the metal container that the shake was made in with all the extra that wouldn't fit in the glass.

My husband got the Farmer Browns' burger and enjoyed it.

I got the Hot Chick sandwich and it was incredible! The perfect combination of flavors and amounts of sauce, cheese, etc. Chicken was perfectly seasoned and grilled. 

The Bonus Daughter got the grilled cheese and for an extra $1 (only homemade chips come with the sandwiches) got the fries. She did not care for the fries. The fries were a bit overly salted and also had pepper and I want to say rosemary on them. I loved them but did try to scrape off some salt.

The waitstaff was very friendly and we got to eat in the outdoor covered area. Great spot. Wish we had something like it close to home."}
{"text":"Busy, fast paced but set up for multiple preferences of sports fans and food connoisseurs alike. Whether you'd like to grab and go, get a drink/snack and stand outside enjoying the day, or prefer a nice set down meal in a upscale contemporary setting with full bar, Burgatory has got what you're looking for.
I enjoyed the light casual feel of the design along with modern contemporary flare.
The food: The customization of the burger puts the power in your hands to create a masterpiece burger. This isn't a normal line up of toppings either. The chef knows just how much of each topping to add.
Service was solid, don't expect the place to be empty!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers!  Nice selection of toppings so that everytime you go it can be something different.   I do not like how close the tables are as I feel that you almost need to introduce yourself to your table neighbors.  You are so close to your neighbors that you really should not talk about anything personal as the neighbors will be able to know all about your issues.  I would like it more if the tables had at least 10 more inches between each table.  That would make it a littel easier to squeeze into your seat without knocking the condiments, or the food off the tables."}
{"text":"'I can't explain, I think it's love.'

Only downside. Went on a Friday night without a reservation. Had to wait 1.5 hours. Either make a reservation or go at a different time."}
{"text":"This place is great! You can either pick from menu items or create your own burger - there are tons of topping options, and some great meat choices besides beef. Menu said they locally source as well, which makes me want to support them even more. If you love traditional burgers, fries, and shake meal but want a twist, check this place out!"}
{"text":"The best burger place in Pittsburgh. 

I went here twice during my stay. The first visit was absolutely mindblowing. I had a chicken burger, which was perfectly cooked, and the organization of the toppings was excellent. The second visit was good but not as good; the burger just seemed rushed. It still tasted pretty good but was a little dry and toppings were added unevenly.

The shakes are delicious and come in large portions. I wasn't a big fan of the hard shakes, but that's probably personal preference.

The wait times can be kind of long, and afaik, you can't make reservations ahead of time.. I suggest you come in between traditional lunch and dinner times for the shortest wait. I came at around 4-5 pm and was seated fairly quickly."}
{"text":"This place was really good. The wait was about 40 minutes for us, but they have a pretty good text messaging system for waiting. I got the Crab Shack. It was good but I feel like their other burgers were probably better. It's basically a big crab cake made into a burger, so if this is your first time, try something else is my recommendation.

We were too full to try the shakes, but my friends and family won't stop telling me how good they are."}
{"text":"It was absolutely delicious!! Way better than Brgr (in Shadyside). 

It was really busy- as expected (friends had highly recommended it) but they texted us when it was ready (after 40 minutes out of the 45-60 min estimated wait time). There are a ton of shops around there to spend the wait time (we went to Barnes & Noble). Staff was friendly and service was prompt once we were seated.

I designed my own burger- I got the bison burger (medium rare) on brioche with a peppercorn rub, sliced tomatoes, and avocado wasabi sauce (which had the perfect touch of wasabi- not too much). The shakes are great too- I tried some of the caramel pretzel shake and it was really tasty (lots of whipped cream). The homemade potato chips that came with the burgers are really good too."}
{"text":"Burgatory's burgers never fail to impress me.  Elk, Bison, build your own and a bunch of creative combinations!  The staff is always excellent and these burgers are worth every penny.  if you love a good burger, I can't say enough good about this place, you just have to check it our for yourself."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place in Pittsburgh! I've eaten here several times and it's always been top notch. I highly recommend the \"Meat your Maker\" burger. has a high end taste that you just don't find at other burger joints. I also like the fact that they use local, organic produce and local beef."}
{"text":"Good eats and a nice atmosphere.  Less expensive than other high end burger places, but u order from the counter and take your food to the table yourself."}
{"text":"My favorite burger. Very good. Thick and juicy. Yum.! Also big selections of meats and toppings and even bread"}
{"text":"Hearing how this place specializes in specialty burgers and craft brews, we went in anticipating a good time and had high expectations.

We were not disappointed. The atmosphere and the decor were relevant to the theme. My burger; a buffalo bison on toasted foccacia with romaine, sun-dried tomatoes, sharp provolone, house ketchup, and whole grain mustered was spiced with \"angel dust.\" I am not exaggerating in saying that it was the best burger I've ever had.

My only gripe was that the waitress was somewhat forgetful but I chalk that up this being a new joint rather than anything detrimental. She was otherwise very friendly and did a great job."}
{"text":"If you want to know what a \"Good\" burger is come here. Chips aren't too great though. Besides that though, I will DEFINITELY be a returning customer."}
{"text":"I don't really get it.  I've been here twice, once last year and was not impressed.  I returned on a day of errands at the end of November.  At first, I thought maybe it's the kitschy name and overall concept.  I want to know why Burgatory? What does purgatory have to do with burgers?  What is the relationship?  And I don't really want to make a burger, I want a chef to combine great flavors that I didn't think of.  And lastly, I reallllly don't like the Red, pink, not pink options for doneness.  Why? Because this is food for dummies.  And in my case, food that made me feel awful within 30 minutes and had drive to a restroom.  It was partially my fault for ordering \"Red,\" but I want my burger to be medium rare like it was intended.  Real restaurants use the normal meat doneness chart used by every other restaurant, excluding the child menus.

Now let's talk about the meat.  The meat is simple and somewhat flavorful, but overall not full of taste in any way.  I know a great burger when I take the first bite,  this was not one.  Your burger is your calling card and this is your best effort?  Sadly, PIttsburgh has made great strides in food, but gourmet burger joints have not kept up.  BRGR and Meat and Potatoes have the only worthwhile burgers in the city.  (I've not been to Winghart's.)  The fries were slightly above average, but not great for a burger joint.  This is your Robin to the BurgerBatman.  And if Burgatory was a comic, it would be on the clearance rack."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Fantastic food, atmosphere, and prices. I hope more of these start popping up."}
{"text":"Terrible experience

This place is to small, the bartender had no personality and I waited 25 minutes for a burger, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I will start with honestly saying, i didn't really want to eat here. It was my Fiancée's choice of date night though. 

Last time I ate at Burgatory, I tried the crab burger. It's about this time when someone yells \"you go to burgatory for burgers! Its not the Crabatory!\"... personally, I feel everything thats on the menu should be executed well, or removed from the menu. The crab burger, was not very good- too much breading, served on a bun...its basically a seafood tasting piece of bread. 

Anyhow, back to my second visit. Not in a burger mood, I placed an order for the Korean Tacos, a side of fries, and a Smores shake. Shortly after placing the order, I thought that theres no way I would be able to eat the entire meal....Fortunately (for my stomach, not so much my wallet), the $9 tacos were the size of mini pancakes and they did not come with any side included (3 tacos per order...or $3 per tiny taco). The tacos had a decent flavor, but overall they lacked any great trait, completely forgettable. 

The side of fries that I ordered was generous, however, it was an additional $4.50. They were good, but it doesn't take much skill to make good french fries. 

As for the S'mores Milkshake.... The flavor was great, the thickness was spot on, the price was a bit steep ($6), but most importantly it was quite disappointing overall. Why? Because my shake that I ordered happened to be 50% whipped Cream. I am not exaggerating. A few sips in I hit thick, creamy whipped cream....and that was it, all that was left really. This could have just been a mistake on mine (although my fiancée's was just as packed with the whipped cream). 

My Fiancee made her own burger, it came with a decent side of fries and overall was affordable. She really enjoyed the burger, disliked the shake for the aforementioned reason. 

I ended up getting sick the following morning....avoid the tacos.... I know, i know....its not the TACOTORY....but again, don't sell stuff that you can't make well."}
{"text":"It took the waitress some time to discover that we are waiting for her to come take our order but she was pleasant.  Negatives: Menu has several code names that we had ask about.....Angel dust, Kona crust, etc etc. Cute! But not helpful for a grouchy, hungry guy like me now. Two: what's up with the chairs? metal, no padding, with two tubes really constraining my butt and I am not the biggest person! Balance chic with comfy please. Positive: The best hamburger I have had in a long while. I had their traditional burger. Fab! My son piled all sorts of stuff on a chicken burger. That came out even more fabulous! I recommend going their in off peak hours. It took them longer on a previous occasion to get us seated and even longer to bring the food which was NOT the taste and quality of our burgers this time. I guess if they are not busy, they put their hearts into it."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food and a wonderful experience. I love the theme and decision tree on the wall."}
{"text":"Bummed with Burgatory.
I usually love this place but tonight's experience in Robinson Twp. Burgatory was not so hot. I ordered a burger, no pink. Guess what? It was pink. So, I sent it back and my second one was also pink, albeit not as pink as the first one. It was edible... if I ate around the pink. Our server didn't even ask if the second one was ok. The manager did come to our table and make amends by taking it off our check. They did the right thing, and I will try Burgatory again. But, when 90% of your food items are burgers, you should be able to cook it to the right temp."}
{"text":"Great food and better shakes. Not as long a wait as I thought."}
{"text":"Epic fail! We ordered three burgers for take out. First, the person who took the order acted like he didn't want to work there....and maybe he shouldn't be. Second, the order was wrong. We only got two fries and paid for three. Two of the three burgers did not have the correct toppings. One had no toppings. And all three burgers were supposed to be cooked medium - one was rare, and one was well done. 

We paid $44 frisking dollars for a bad attitude and the crappy tasting burgers. Perhaps other Burgatory's have better service, but It's not worth finding out."}
{"text":"When it comes to burgers I can no longer venture to others restaurants. When it comes to customizing a burger you won't find better options anywhere.  I challenge you to find another burger place where they have 9 different unique choices."}
{"text":"I don't get it. The burgers are just ok and uninspired which is why most of you build your own, which I can do in my own kitchen frankly. I try not to refer to other businesses when I review, but burghers in harmony pa is THE best burger. Local beef and inspiration for many of his custom creations. This place serves an ok burger, same level as max and ermas or  TGIF which is not my cup of tea. Milk shakes are good, good beer list.  Perfect location for their business. They'll do well based on that."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!  The meat was seasoned to perfection.  This burger is tasty and juicy. I was surprised and shocked. This is a definite stop when in the Steel City. The fries are very good and crisp. I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Met my expectations.  Not the best burger I have ever had but it was great overall.  The wait time was a little longer than I had expected but the food that came out was worth the wait.  I like their burgers because you can fully customize what you want and they have every topping imaginable.  I enjoy having fried egg on my burger and they had that option (not many places do).  They do have some really good shakes and I think that those are the highlight of the restaurant.  Reminds me of red robbin.  I give red Robbin the edge on the burgers but give burgatory the edge on shakes."}
{"text":"Ah, gustatory Burgatory.  Outside of the State Fair of Texas, I've never seen so many grams of fat in so small a meal (not a true story).

There are so many wonderful things to say about Burgatory: the drinks are awesome (try the spiked milkshakes), the burgers are excellent (ask your server about the burger of the day and remember Saturday is wild game day), and the fries, while very salty, are excellent.  Burgers come with house-made potato chips that I don't particularly like, but they'll gladly substitute fries for those.

The bland strip mall that serves as Burgatory's location does no justice to the amazing service and food you'll find inside.

The one thing that brings this down from five stars to four is the wait.  I'm not sure *any* burger is worth a two-hour wait, so I tend to hit Burgatory later in the evening, at which point I'm nearly starving, the servers are visibly worn out, and the wait is a mere one hour instead of two.  At least there's a Barnes & Noble a few doors down."}
{"text":"After a couple of visits, I am totally a fan of this place.  Whoever is the mastermind of this concept has got to be doing well.  Where else can you have your shake cost just as much as your burger?  Genius!  

The first visit, our family went with:

Salted Nutella Crunch shake ($6) - delicious - enough for our table of 4 to split
Grand-dad shake ($8) - lots of caramel and bourbon - would be good as a dessert if you have room to spare
Morty's Steakhouse ($10.50) - lots of flavors going on here - everything sort of got muddled by the end.
Standard Deluxe ($8.50) - my wife loved her choice of burger.  Simple, to the point, delicious.
The kids got chicken tenders and the hot dog ($6 each) and you get a choice between a Cherry Coke Float or a Coke Float as a dessert.

On the second visit, my wife and I each got the Standard Deluxe and we skipped the shakes.  The burgers were perfectly cooked and dressed - simplicity was key here!  I opted for the $1.50 upcharge for fries instead of the homemade chips.  This was a great choice - there were rosemary sprigs in the fries which really added some great flavor to them.  

On both visits, there was a substantial wait of 1 hour+.  When you check in, you give them your cell number and the hostess will text you when your table is ready.  If you have a smartphone, even better.  Click the link on the confirmation text you receive and you can actually track your wait on your phone's web browser.  When I checked in, there was a tracker showing me there were 22 parties ahead of me.  Each time I refreshed, I was given a real time view of how we were moving up in the queue.  This allowed our family to run some errands and accurately track how much time we had before being seated.  This is a great feature.

My only criticism has got to be the service.  The food is worth coming back - don't get me wrong.  However, both visits were a bit uneven in the service department.  Drinks went unrefilled for long stretches of time and a bit of a lag waiting for our check.  Our servers were courteous on both visits - just a little hard to find when I needed something."}
{"text":"Very delicious! perfect place to go for lunch. Burgers are big and milkshakes are phenomenal! Though i haven't gotten the pleasure to dine in yet, at work we would all order take-out."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, wings, and shakes.  Solid beers on tap, and big screen sports.  Doesnt get much better than this for casual fun with friends or family"}
{"text":"I'm from California. My first time in Pittsburgh (cam specifically for the Steelers Game) and I have to say I was not disappointed with this restaurant selection. The food was excellent! Wide variety of food and the milkshakes are to die for. The customer service was exceptional and our waitress was very attentive to us. The only reason I'm not giving them a five star rating is because of the miscalculated wait time in game day-we waited for 2hrs but was told an hour and fifteen minutes would be our wait time. We'll be sure to come back and try different things when we visit again."}
{"text":"Creating your own burger is such a bonus! Well taken care of from start to finish.  The burgers are unbelievable.  Beautiful place and staff!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after the Steelers vs. Patriots game(proud Pats fan!!) and my burger was absolutely outstanding!! Created my own with the wagyu beef and it was delicious and juicy like a burger should be. Would absolutely recommend if you're ever in the Heinz field area."}
{"text":"My waiter came to my table twice. He was very kind but i find it unacceptable especially for this price range because its bad enough having a forty-five minute wait for two people. The food tasted fine. However, i paid extra for cabernet sauce which felt like an insult because i love that sauce but they literally gave me a dab of it for my quarter pound of meat. By the time my waiter came back after serving us our food i just wanted to leave. I paid a lot of money for a simple burger and really mediocre service. The milkshake was ok but people are ridiculous making a big deal out of it like jesus is behind the counter making them. It was a milkshake and it was OK. I'd feel better spending 1/4 the price for a larger one at Paige's down the road. Why? Because its a MILKSHAKE. Hopefully the other locations are better..."}
{"text":"The deep fried ribs appetizer was delicious! Along with the expresso love hard milkshake. Trippin mushroom chicken burger was great. There wasnt one dish at our table that wasnt fantastic. We went on a Wednesday night so the place wasn't packed. Location was very nice. Enjoyed the decor. Prices were on point. A must try!"}
{"text":"So good! Nice, small dinning room with open windows. Great service and vanilla fortune cookies after the food! And kids get free cherry coke floats if they eat everything."}
{"text":"What a great find! Flew in for business and ashamed to say my GPS was taking me to Fuddruckers in Waterfront. Little did I know that when I got there it was out of business with no sign it had ever been there. So, I parked and started to walk around the shops and ran across BURGATORY. Man on man am I ashamed to have ever looked for the F place. BURGATORY is the bomb! I ordered the bison, cooked pink with buffalo gouda, lettuce tomatoes, red onions and side of creamy horseradish. It was heaven on a bun. Got a side of the fries and cole slaw. Everything was fantastic and I'm already looking forward to my next trip to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Burger was a burger. Nothing special here. A generic burger for $10? I feel cheated. I will not order again. They'll be bankrupt within a year."}
{"text":"Meh. 

I'm always down for a good burger. I got the Meet Your Maker with fries and a vanilla shake. It was ... Good. Nothing special. The burger was definitely pink/red inside (which I prefer) but the outside of the burger tasted burned. Not sure how that happens. Serving sizes are small. The shake was pretty tasty and very thick. Customer service was appropriate, though the gentleman at the front desk did make me feel rather uncomfortable as a single woman going to the restaurant alone. I would consider coming back with a group and trying the drinks/hard shakes."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for lunch. 

Excellent burgers. The meat, bun, and toppings are all good. Unlike some other burger joints, you want to go a bit light on the toppings so you can taste how good the beef is. 

Take the time to create your own burger. The wait staff will help you navigate which rub you want if you are unsure what each one you will like best.

For sides I can recommend either the organic greens which is a tasty salad or the fries which are equally tasty.

The milkshakes are excellent, though the whipped cream tastes a bit like marshmallows which some people like and some don't. 

They are very allergen friendly.

The only thing I can say bad about them is their kid's meals. My kids don't like any of them, but they do like splitting a full size burger that they enjoy creating together."}
{"text":"Ate here and BRGR within a two-week period (do not ask me for my cholesterol count).  And this place was as awesome as I had been told.  The \"Morty's Steakhouse\" burger was delicious.  Only negative was the long wait for a table (and no reservations on a weekend).  Bit of a bummer - but definitely worth the wait if you have the time."}
{"text":"In town for the steelers game over the weekend and was so excited to visit this spot. Unfortunately it was one of the worst experiences ever. Walked in Friday night and it was an hour until the kitchen closed. The bartender was rude and barely would let us pick what we wanted to drink let alone offer a drink menu until we asked. Then finally after rudely giving drinks and not even saying a \"your welcome\" after saying thank you for drinks she asked if we had ever been here before (we had only been at the bar for 20 minutes) She then proceeded to offer menus and we ordered a couple appetizers and they were cold and awful. Such a bummer this was such a horrible experience. We come to Pittsburgh once a year for a game and will not go back at least to this location. With all other bars and restaurants in the area this and coming to the Pittsburgh for years this was our only bad experience out of the whole city."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! Food and service rocks!!!!  Burgers are the best I have ever had!  Friendliest staff in town!"}
{"text":"Good burger.  Great shake.  Fine beer selection.  I have been on the search for the best burger in the country, and although this place is good, it still falls below Schuberg's Tavern in  Michigan, some drugstore in Savannah, and Dot's Back Inn in Richmond, Va.  I'd come here again...good fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. The food was delicious. I had the Sonoma Chopped Chicken Salad for 13$ and it was a great salad. It looked and tasted great. 
I also had one of their famous shakes, the Salty Nutella Shake (or something like that) for 6$. Really nice Bar. My husband had an elkburger and he loved it. I would go back there anytime we had a great dinner."}
{"text":"This place is always packed. I had the Yin-Yang Chicken. It was good. 

I guess I eat out too much because my only real complaint is the menu hasn't really changed at all since they opened. If you aren't friends with the hosts/hostesses be prepared to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Super awesome.

The H and I went last night and had the make your own burgers.  Bison, to be exact, which is much lower in fat than regular meat.  SO very tasty.  Also, we had the onion ring appetizers, which are as gigantic as everyone says they are.  

H had the Grandad's Secret milkshake, with caramel and bourbon, and they didn't spare the bourbon.  I had the Monkey Business.  Apparently there was banana liquor in there, but I couldn't find it for the dark rum.

The place was packed, so they told us a 25 minute wait, took our cell phone number and we were free to roam.  We were texted early, seated early, and when we were done, we got a thank you text!

Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Both at the Penguins stadium (although limited menu) this place always satisfies. Between the hard shakes (toasted almond torte) and the bison burger I don't know where to begin. I even had the quinoa Apple salad the other day and it was surprisingly delicious! Ive stopped here for a quick meal and the sliders and some Gorgonzola truffle fries are a tasty snack. The fries alone are amazing. Don't expect to get out of here without stuffing yourself. My only complaint is that the seating is kind of odd. Lots of high tops (which I don't like) and uncomfortable chairs. Sometimes the area can be quite loud with the TVs on and a bunch of people talking in the open air environment. Overall, extremely pleased with this burger joint and will continue to return!"}
{"text":"Received call back from Director of Operations Vic Bovalino who apologized but wasn't willing to correct the situation by parting ways with the bad server. I guess management values bad servers more than paying customers. I'll be sharing my poor experience with everyone I can. Owners of this restaurant need to clean house."}
{"text":"After driving for over an hour and waiting another hour for my burger. .....you get something that looks like it was dropped enroute to our table.....rare or red does not mean dark brown.......I did not have another hour to waste and return it.....cute concept as far as design....but had to be the worst burger ever...p.helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They start out by using the nowait app which allows them to text you when your table is ready, so you don't have to stand there in the restaurant waiting, you can go shop around the plaza. It is a nice change of pace. 

One suggestion I make is if you are going to get the Shakes, share with someone else because a shake and a burger from here is just TOO much. SO DELICIOUS though. 

I typically make my own --- but the last time I was there I had the crab cake sandwich and it was, I'm fairly certain, the best crab cake sandwich I have ever tasted. 

They have a different list of beers on draft when you're there so that's always fun. They recommend asking the waiter, but when a friend of mine asked the waiter what the sangria tasted like her response was \"idk, i'm not 21 so i cant drink it\" as if that was somehow our fault. Tip to any waiter or waitress, if you don't know... find out the answer, because it caused my friend to then not order a drink and just get the standard free water. It was a very rude way to handle the question. Our waitress was not polite and when we were ready to free up the table and move to the bar to finish watching the hockey game, she was nowhere to be found.  (I'll tell you, though, this isn't the typical service I get at this restaurant, the wait staff is usually VERY VERY helpful and friendly). 

Their onion rings are to die for. They used to have a buffalo chicken dip that was really good too -- though I didn't see it on the menu when I was there last. 

Overall- you won't be disappointed. The atmosphere is just like any other bar-type restaurant. Everything on the menu is delicious, I've been with multiple different people and have never heard a bad thing about it. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I was FINALLY able to try the famous Burgatory here in Pittsburgh!

Some of my first thoughts--very cool looking place! I love the walls and decorations they have around the joint. The bar is also very contemporary and sits nicely in the restaurant.

The burgers? Good--but I have to report (sadly) that I was a bit underwhelmed. Perhaps it's because there has been so much hype about these places and from my friends that I thought that the burger would have just blown me away. I had a milkshake for desert. Spiked was a little too rich I thought.

Is it worth it? Sure, but not for a 30 minute plus wait. Come check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, awesome fries, and to die for homemade cream sodas ... what more can I say. Get your butt down to Burgatory and sin sin sin"}
{"text":"Let's start with a decent beer list.  Young's Double Chocolate Stout?  Thank you, I'll have several as it's very rare to find it served anywhere in Pittsburgh.

We went on a Thursday night, full house, but we were seated almost immediately.

As for my burger, I decided to build my own: PCP-laced Bison cooked med-rare; topped with bacon, gorgonzola and roasted peppers.  It was excellent and all I could do was lament the fact that this place was not located downtown.

I cannot recall what my friends ordered, but perhaps worth noting that this was their 3rd or 4th trip.

If Burgatory's quality holds up over time, it could supplant Tessaro's (blasphemy, I know) given their broader selection."}
{"text":"Burgatory is the only place to get the real best burger in town. I have heard people complain about the price, but frankly you get what you pay for. If you want a generic burger theres plenty of so so places around. 

Everytime I go to Burgatory I do a build your own burger. I highly recommend going with bison as your meat choice. They cook it medium and it is so tender and delicious. As an fyi, my bf always get the standard beef and raves about it as well. I love the bayou cajun rub because it gives it an almost blackened flavor. I have tried several of the different unique flavors and the horseradish cheddar is my favorite. The whole grain mustard and spicy ketchup are great twists on your basic mustard and ketchup. There are tons of toppings to choose from as well!  The homemade chips on the side are a mix of regular and sweet potato. I dont even like sweet potatoes and I eat these chips. The service is great and ambiance is neat. We have also ordered to go and surprisingly, the quality remains even taking it home!  Definitely a must try if you love burgers!"}
{"text":"When I get glowing recommendations from friends, I am skeptical. So when I had my first chance to go to Burgatory I was cautious.  How can you be known for great burgers and shakes?

This simply was the GREATEST BURGER I have ever had.  The flavor was out of this world. The options are unique and tasty.  The rest at this table were equally impressed. That never happens.

The shakes were sooo good too. They were appropriately served with super wide straws.  The whipped cream was a decadent topper.

The theming is spot on and fun.

I don't work there or know anyone who does. Don't second guess going here.  Just go and indulge."}
{"text":"Huge shakes. Good burger. Decent Gorgonzola fries (I say make them less greasy). In total LOTS of food. I was full before I even got to my burger by sipping on my bf's shake and sharing the fries. Love the fact that you can customize your burger. This scores major points with me!"}
{"text":"Love the fact that I can really have a burger the way I want it! I can chose to have Bison, Elk or just a plain old fashioned beef hamburger made to the exact temperature I like. A great array of toppings starting with the rubs down to the lettuce and sauces. The home made chips added as a side are the perfect compliment. 

The kids love the shakes and I love the fact that they bring all the extra to refill which gives me the opportunity to taste each one (drives my kids crazy). 

I have never been disappointed after having a meal there and the kids enjoy the place so it is a win win!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal here last night !  Amazing bison burgers and fantastic service. Yes it is expensive for burgers .... But you definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"It's an interesting concept, I felt it could have been done better, but the business seems to be thriving. They keep track of the wait by ipad and send you a text when you're table is ready. I had a bourbon milkshake and she had a flavored gin and tonic, I thought both were good, only mine was a little overpriced for how much alcohol you get. I had the farmer's burger and she the vegetarian. Hers was alright, mine was less so. The vegetarian was good, but lacked proper texture for a veggie burger. The farmer's burger, which has an over-easy egg on it, came out brown and not pink with an over-hard egg on top. It was just dry, thankfully I had a boozed up milkshake to wash it down with.  The service was great, if a little amusing, kept leaving our drinks at the bar for two minutes then apologizing profusely. Overall, not worth the drive, considering brgr is right down the street; but if you're in the area, it's worth the price."}
{"text":"We went to Burgatory to grab a bite to eat before a Pirates game. There was no wait and ample indoor and outdoor seating. Menu prices were higher for a burger joint but considering the location, not outrageous.

The burger menu was fantastic and there were even a few lighter options that also sounded delicious. Definitely good to note if you're not in the mood for a burger. But we all were and the burgers, chips and fries were fantastic! 

The shakes looked great too but after the burgers no one had room. If you want to try both I'd  recommend splitting a burger."}
{"text":"You can eat your weekly calorie allotment here in one meal!

Caramel pretzel milkshake is to die for!  Note to all:  split it, don't try to drink it alone if you are eating a burger as well.  And, it's not that great when it is all melty!

Beef burgers are made to order--yum!  Got the ciabatta bun--mistake.  Too hard to eat your burger this way.  Not exceptionally big burgers, but they can be loaded with all your favorites!

Go at an off hour if you want to hold a conversation with the person you are with.  Extremely noisy!"}
{"text":"Being someone who does not eat red meat, it makes if very difficult to find a good burger- Burgatory is just the place to do that. I had a make-your-own-esque burger and the list of things to add to it went on for a full page. Everything from the standard, to pineapple was offered and an addition was only $.50 or $1. 
The only thing that was disappointing was the service, but then again it was at a rush on a Friday evening. Overall a great meal for a good price."}
{"text":"DON'T GO! BAD FOOD BAD SERVICE!!!!!
we ordered bison and meat ur maker
wings and fries.. not worth it!
i went to burgatory with my brother and it was the worse burger we ever had aside from that the waitress who was very rude and didn't have any information about the menu. My brother order his burger with no pink ( how they say medium well) and it came out raw all through. Nothing special about the fries or chips we also ordered the wings that were ok."}
{"text":"The shakes were soooooo good! 
The burgers were...fine. Can't really comment on the regular meat burger, although people seemed pleased with their meals but nobody was blown away. THE VEGGIE BURGER: it needs work. Too mushy, it fell apart when I tried to eat my burger. Not flavorful enough, even though I put a million (ok 5ish) toppings on it.

Oh and a 1 hour wait on a Monday night? :(

It was fun but I have had MUCH better veggie burgers, so I am still on the hunt for my Burghy burger joint!"}
{"text":"\"Honor they burger and they mother.\"...That's the sentiment on the wall at Burgatory, and it's clear they live by it. 'Cause yeah, they honor their burgers there!

Let me start by talking about the Truffle Gorgonzola Fries, because OMG -- they're so freakin' good. The truffle flavor is prevalent, and they don't skimp on the gorgonzola. The serving is fairly large, so if ya wanna finish your burger, you should def split this with someone! 

I've gotten the salted caramel pretzel milkshake every time I've gone. It's just one if those things that's so delish, I am not even willing to risk trying something else that may not measure up. The lil chunks of pretzel swimming in the creamy caramel ice cream... Perfection.

All the burgers I've had there have been delish, too. And large. They're big. I haven't finished my burger once. 

Oh, and if you're going on a weekend day, be prepared to wait, because you very well may have to -- especially if it's later in the day/evening. But, it's really not so bad because you just give them your cell number, and they text you when your table is ready! Since they're in a plaza, there are stores galore that can occupy your waiting time. (I recommend the TJ Maxx next door!)"}
{"text":"I've visited twice, once on a Friday night and once on an off-peak week night. Going on a Friday night is/was a mistake. The place is packed, you can't make reservations as I understand it, and they have an odd procedure for putting your name down. We witnessed people being given upwards of 15-20 minutes to return once they were informed there table was ready. Frustrating. But I knew it was gonna suck as far as wait being Friday night. I'm a firm believer that NO meal is worth waiting for, expecially for for waiting over and hour - for a burger. But as I said that one is on me for going on a Friday night. My other visit was much more pleasant and prompt. 

Out of all the new burger joints in the 'Burgh. This place is the winner thus far. Portion sizes up to par. Tasty food. Ability to create your own burger. The only improvement would be the one I make for just about every restaurant - please stop using vegetable oil for frying. It tastes like crap and it's horrible for your health. Lard, bacon fat, butter, etc. All far better options. 

Burgatory has offically been added to the rotation, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I came with my wife and kid due to reading all the positive reviews it got. We liked the atmosphere and energy this place gave off and the food was good but not that great. People i guess tend to like atmosphere more than food in this day of age, me however food is number one."}
{"text":"After a 2 hour shop a thon @ IKEA we needed booze and food fast. We stopped in for a quick bite. There was a 30 min wait for a table so we grabbed 2 seats at the bar. We were greeted immediately and skimmed over the menu. We both decided to build our own burgers. I was delighted to see they offered a chicken and veggie option. I chose a chicken burger on foccia Cajun dusted, Habernero Honey Mustard, onions, and jalapeño.(yes I like it spicy) The spiked milkshake of the day was a chocolate covered strawberry #heaven. It didn't take long for our food to arrive. This was the best chicken burger ever!!!!!!! I'm so glad we stumbled upon this place I will absolutely stop back in!!!"}
{"text":"It was a little loud for a Saturday pm, but when we asked the hostess to turn down the music, she did! She made a smart remark about it being a part of their thing or whatever to keep the music at an unhealthy decibel level but I really appreciate them doing that. It's nice to sit down to a meal and actually talk to other people. Though we notice many youngsters stare at their plastic palm pilots.  

To the meat. Burgers were very good. One of us had a chicken breast sandwich instead. (Weirdo.) We also ordered onion rings which were very good but too expensive for what you received. We all substituted fries for chips and it was worth it. I am not sure where they get their beef but it isn't the best I've ever had. We get beef from our local butcher which is better, but they did a fine job with cooking it -- charred on the outside with a pink center, and they were generous with the toppings. No complaints, just happy chomping.  

Service was decent. When we took our time ordering, we felt we were forgotten. But our server recovered. Our food came out quickly. No big deal. We left happy. 

They have a good selection of beer, but it's way over-priced. I think I will try a shake instead next time or maybe I can sneak a carafe of white wine like my mom used to at Pizza Hut. She would ask for a cup of ice. To this day she will deny it. 

For a party of three, our bill came to $75 including tip, but we also had 2 beers. Skip the alcohol and it seems reasonably priced for the quantity and quality.

Thanks again for turning down the music. We live in the age of Walkman's when everyone can deafen to their own tunes. Or next time I will bring my boom box."}
{"text":"Totally overrated and was WAY better when it first opened. Food has consistently gone downhill over the past year, and is in no way worth the outrageous wait times. We never wait. If we can't get right in, we leave. The food is often over salted and the milkshakes too thick. I think if Burgatory had stayed focused on its food and not on becoming a local chain, the quality would not have suffered so much."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  About two weeks ago my husband and I wanted to eat out and couldn't agree on a place.  He suggested Burgatory.  We hadn't been there in months and frankly I'd gotten a little tired of it but acquiesced.    We placed our reservation using NO WAIT app (the very best for Burgatory) and by the time we'd ordered drinks at the bar our table was ready.
I really didn't know what I wanted to order so I asked the Excellent server for her suggestion.
And the burger she suggested was A-MAZ-ING.  Truly, I told my husband I wasn't going to be able to talk very much because I was taking the time to let the flavors dance on my palate.  I mean it was wonderful.  I don't remember the Name of the burger, but I know the protein was \"50/50\",  that is 50% beef and 50% ground bacon.  And it had a rub on it.  Sorry I can't be of more help there.

But I wanted to write the update in case you, like me, thought you'd had all that Burgatory can offer.  Let me say for the record that they CONTINUE to add new dishes and tastes.  This one knocked my socks off!!"}
{"text":"Our server Courtney was amazingly attentive and friendly.   The burgers did not disappoint.   I would say that this is my favorite burger joint bar none, however the chips and fries were cold and limp.   Won't deter me from coming back."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!  Fries are the bomb!  Burgers and shakes good too!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I love Burgatory--we frequently visit the Mccandless location. We don't like that they switched their fries, but they're still good. Service is great, food is great, and if you want a fast burger, then you should go through a drive-thru. It is well worth the wait for the quality and service you get."}
{"text":"New to town. Saw on news that they won some burger contest and we decided to give it a try. 

Hostess was too cool to work there...but the did have the cool text message wait list...always convenient. Waitresses was nice and helped walk us through everything. 

Burgers were not contest worthy...nearing bad. Over priced under-sized and under-cooked...I like a pink burger but this was half alive when we ate them. 

Milkshake was topping overload! All it was was chopped up pretzels with a little bit of ice cream. Not pleased.

Onion rings were best part of the lunch...they were good but we were also really hungry at that point as they were apps.

For 2 burgers, 2 kids grilled cheese, 2 drinks, onion rings and one shake....we spent $80. Would rather of had 5guys, right next door, which I don't like...but 5guys has a better product that doesn't force me to skip a mortgage payment.

I miss Smashburger!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing - you can't beat the atmosphere (except the heat could have been up a little higher) - everything about the place is cool and the burgers are exceptional - fantastic quality meat and a substantial burger - the service and the price aren't half bad either."}
{"text":"If I could give 5 stars for their food I would because  it's good but when you are told 25 min for curbside pickup you take 15 min to get there then wait 30 and still no food WTF"}
{"text":"This place is your typical gourmet burger place, and their prices are pretty reasonable given the quality of the meat and the toppings. I went with a group of four, all of us got the build your own burger. I got the ground beef with the peppercorn rub, grilled onions, and onion straws. Also with a side of BBQ. They did forget to put the onion straws on, but it didn't take much out of the flavor. It was a fabulous burger. The cut was probably about a quarter pound and it was very juicy on a hearty bun. The BBQ sauce was spicy, which surprised me. The burgers typically come with chips, but two of the people in my party upgraded to the jalapeño cornbread. They said it was very good and moist, and ended up being more than they could finish. 

All in all, the food was great. I would go back in a heartbeat. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was for the service. Forgetting the onion straws and overall attentiveness."}
{"text":"Definitely the better burgers around town. Not expensive and I like the create your own burger menu as well. That being said the staff can sometimes be invisible as far as wanting to order or when sitting at the bar and there's only one bartender. 

Seating is the worst part of this place. I refuse to take the bench seating that you basically sit right next to some stranger with and can have no private conversation. 

All in all I would ask for a booth or sit in the bar area. Know what you want when you get there and don't keep the waitress coming back or she'll forget about you."}
{"text":"Best veggie burger I've had in Pittsburgh. The milkshakes were so quite delicious and thick. This location is one of a few in the county but this is brand new (as of April 2014). The other locations usually have a 2 hr or long wait and hopefully this will help drop it."}
{"text":"Best burger joint in town! I'm from Chicago, and I have to come here every time I'm in Pittsburgh for a baseball, hockey, or football game! Great burgers! Great atmosphere! Great service! Right next to pnc park and Heinz field!"}
{"text":"i had been waiting sooo long to come here after i saw a friend post a picture of their gorgonzola fries, and alas! the time had finally come. well... after an HOUR AND A HALF / HOUR AND FORTY-FIVE MIN wait to be seated. (you'd think they'd learn to either take reservations or expand by now).

well, at least after getting a table, i'm happy to say that burgatory definitely did not disappoint (and i definitely went  home in a massive food coma). 

ordered the onion rings & gorgonzola fries to start / on the side. boyfriend ordered their crabcake sandwich & i made my own bison burger. the gorgonzola fries were heavenlyyy. the onion rings were also thick and crunchy, though i would probably hold off on ordering them next time and save room for a shake (which i heard are quite delectable).  and of course, i enjoyed both the crabcake and bison burgers. 

took the side chips in a to-go box. still crunchy and delicious the next day. can't wait to come back here, though i'll probably try to come on  a tuesday afternoon or something."}
{"text":"People seem to love this place. We went on a Tuesday night and had a minimal wait time to be seated. Parking is a little bit tough on weekends so beware! The waitstaff was nice enough. They answered our questions politely but had the tendency to disappear for long periods of time. Still, they did their job just fine and I don't really like when waiters hover. 

The food seemed pretty straightforward. Burgers taking up most of the menu. They give you the option to build your own so I took that route. I got a beef burger, wheat bun, chedder cheese, salt and pepper rub, garlic mayo, lettuce, onion, poblano peppers and greens. Their system for asking how you want the burger done is red, pink or done (I can't actually remember the word they used for well done, sorry). I chose pink. 

My burger arrived and I got American cheese instead of cheddar. Kind of disappointing right off the bat but not a deal breaker by any means. The garlic mayo was fabulous. The toppings were all fresh and crisp. The wheat bun was delicious and not too thick. The actual burger patty was a huge disappointment. My burger was charred on the outside, pink in the middle, and super dry. Maybe we were just there on an off night but if they did a better job of cooking the burger it would have been a heavenly hamburger. Everything about it was great except the actual beef. Another member of our party got her burger done to \"red\" and she said hers was the same way. Charred on the outside and a bit dry though red in the middle. It was kind of disappointing. I've had better burgers but really think if the actual patty had been cooked differently it really would have been a great burger I got my burger with the standard russet and sweet potato chips. There were about three sweet potato chips to the rest russet. Kind of sad since the sweet potato ones were far superior. I'm going to give this place another chance and hope for a better outcome."}
{"text":"The vegan options are so great! The server was educated about vegan options and the food was delicious. I couldn't believe how good the vegan milkshake was! They even have nondairy whip on top. Love having a place nearby with delicious vegan options!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers for those who like to try something new or customize all the way.  Portions were good size and the food was outrageously good.  The staff were all very polite and pleasant.  Only downside, they were a bit slow on getting drinks but you may need that amount of time to figure out what to settle on for your meal!  Overall a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Gave this place 2 tries and was let down both times..the chips were so bland and the burgers were...fine. Nothing extraordinary for the price..wont go back."}
{"text":"Great food and great service :) Burgatory is my favorite burger place in Pittsburgh :)"}
{"text":"My favorite burger place!!!!  Meat your maker is absolutely the best burger I have ever had. And the sweet potato chips!  The milkshakes are pretty awesome, too. I wish they would build a Burgatory in NJ!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have eaten. A lot of options to choose from and a very friendly staff. Def recommend trying if you are looking for a really good burger around the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Gourmet Burger places are all the rage and this place holds it's own and then some.
Great options for building your own burger as well as pre-made gourmet burgers. I like to try the pre-made burgers to evaluate the chefs and I was not disappointed. I had the Meat Your Maker and it was amazing. All burgers come with free chips with other sides like fries, baked beans etc for an up charge. Good craft beer selection and great staff. The decor is also quite nice. Trendy & cool but not snooty. My only complaint... No Pretzel buns.  Also they should add Poutine to the menu. I'm not Canadian but I know this place needs Poutine. Finally I had to try a milk shake I didnt go for an alcohol induced milk shake which was probably a mistake but I had the Salted Carmel Nutella shake and it was delicious. My second suggestion would be to add Malts to the Shake menu. I will certainly be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh. Loved it."}
{"text":"I've been to the Burgtary at waterworks mall. This one is equally great. Shakes are AMAZING! Love very one of them! Staff is friendly. We got there during weekday lunch time. Not like the one at waterworks, we didn't have to wait for seat."}
{"text":"I've been to Burgatory many times and each time I go the quality seems to decrease. After the last time I went, I will never go back. Their burgers are always over-cooked no matter how you ask them to be grilled and they use really cheap buns. Their food is just not good.  Everything is super over priced based on the quality of what you get. The wait is always horrendous too.  This was a really cool place to eat when it first opened; you couldn't pay me to eat there again."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner on a Wednesday night a few weeks ago.  The server was just terrible.  Food came out after about 35-40 minutes and we had no silverware.  When I asked her for silverware she walked in the back and continued serving drinks to another table.  She never returned, so I had to go up to the bar to ask for it.  She needs training big time!"}
{"text":"I was meeting my sister for lunch when I was up in the Pittsburgh area.  We had to decide where to go near Robinson so of course we followed fellow Yelpers and said we HAVE to try out Burgatory.  Surely this is a meal that would not disappoint.  Sigh.  Oh my did it ever.  Preface:  There were three of us eating and we checked it at around 2 p.m. after the major lunch crowd and before dinner.

When we entered we were greeted by the world's most depressing hostess.  We laughed about this afterwards because each time she came to seat another group near us her angst was almost palpable...the subtle scent of bitterness wafted through the air with her every approach.  Then, my sister and I went to use the ladies room before we went to our table.  The bathrooms are so dark you almost need to use your cell phone as a night light.  They were only semi-clean and one of the two soap holders was completely empty and the other barely hanging on.

We made our way to their patio section which is open to the main bar.  It is a nice area and if the weather permits, I suggest sitting there because not only is it covered to avoid rain, but you get an excellent view of the bar/tv's, etc without being totally indoors.  We were then greeted again by one of the worst waitresses I have ever had.  I could go on and on, but she consistently rushed us and made us feel as if we were imposing on her schedule (again, not during a rush time of dining).  For example, one time when she came back to our table to see if we were ready to order, I told her that my sister was outside taking a business call (politely left the dining area not to disturb other customers) and she acted as if this was an imposition.

Food and drink.  There are only two wines that Burgatory offers.  Neither of these are listed on the drink menu; rather, they are listed within the main menu.  You are supposed to intuitively know this, otherwise your waitress will make you feel like a dummy.  At $8 per glass they do give you a generous pour (probably 6 ounces) but they brag about how many beers they have on tap and their mixed cocktails and yet only provide a \"red\" and \"white\" wine selection.  Also, I don't want to spend $4.50 for a Yeungling draft beer when I am in PA.  Down in the south where it is a domestic \"import\", yes I would.

For appetizers we ordered the onion rings and the nachos (with chicken chili on the side because I am a veg/pesc.)  The onion rings are $8 for five onion rings.  They were large and amply breaded but I thought they were not as crispy or worth the price tag in my opinion.  At $1.30/piece I expect perfection.  The nachos were a mess.  They are huge and full of wonderful toppings but by the time you receive them, all but the outer chips are soggy and a mess.  We left most of the plate uneaten.  

For dinner the hubby ordered the Meat Your Maker burger ($14).  I tried one of his fries after he said they were terrible and I agreed.  They were soft, no crispiness at all.  He ordered it with the beef option and said that it was OK.  My sister and I split the Crab Shack burger (portions, beside the onion rings, are huge).  This was the saving grace of the experience.  If you go there, this is the burger to get.  Ample crab meat, few fillers and pan fried perfectly. However, the \"chips\" they serve along side were overly cooked, almost burnt.  Not at all a good accompaniment.  

In total our bill was $109 for 3 people for three draft beers, two glasses of wine, 2 apps and 2 sandwiches including an 18% tip (after tax so really 20%, as opposed to my usual 25%...because of terrible service).  That price tag is right for an excellent lunch but certainly not appropriate for our experience.

In short, highly overrated and highly overpriced.  Even if my expectations were elevated by its reputation, this restaurant falls dramatically short of a 5 star rating.

P.s.  When we went back to the restroom after dinner the soap dispensers were still empty and we did not receive a thank you from the depressed hostess.  As Yelp says, \"Me thinks not.\""}
{"text":"Out of 5:

2.5 - Fries
1.5 - Wagyu burger: very overcooked, dry
2.0 - Beef burger: cooked better, but still unsatisfactory

4.0 - Salty pretzel shake - delicious, chunky, and a lot."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place since my husband and I were in the area. I have to say, pretty darn good burgers. I like how they offer a variety of burgers with different types of protein and you can even build your own burger. I tried the Elk gone wild which was full of flavor, especially with the bacon jam! My husband ordered the Meat your maker, which I thought was equally as good. For an appetizer, we ordered the seoul tacos. It was pretty scrumptious, the meat was so juicy and tender. We also tried the expresso love milk shake, which is great for all the coffee lovers out there! I liked how there were bits and pieces of the coffee bean in the milkshakes so you still have some crunch with the milkshake. Good food and nice lively atmosphere. Would definitely come back to try the other burgers and milkshakes."}
{"text":"I'm biased. I eat here once a week and I love this place more than any other place in the burgh. They continue to increase their variety in meats. Win. This place only deserves 5 stars. Great service, better food."}
{"text":"So after a long trip, we need something to eat. Let's try something new. All I can say is this place is average at best. I could tell the host was annoyed that tables weren't getting cleaned fast enough to seat a hungry waiting crowd, but he should have kept his cool (it's all good, man). Once we got a table, I felt like the waitress was rushing too. (They were busy). I ordered the build your own burger, which was ok, and the potato salad... It was extremely cold...I'm eating potato salad, not ice cream, right? All in all, I think this place could be awesome, just came on the wrong night. Smh :-("}
{"text":"I never post. But this place was well below expectations. Flat Beer. Cold Fries. Burger underwhelming. Only redeeming part was my great company. Don't go here"}
{"text":"The best milkshakes in town!!! The best veggie burger in town! Nothing compares to the fun atmosphere this restaurant provides. I live making my own creation. Everything I've tried there was always great. The seating in the main dining area can be really tight....meaning, you can look as though you are sitting WITH other diners that aren't in your group...yep, it's that close! But, other areas have more space. Try the onion rings; they are huge and delicious; especially with the kickin' ketchup. If you are a vegetarian, you MUST try phat patty's veggie burger. You won't be disappointed. The bison burger is my hubby's favorite. The fact that this place uses LOCAL produce and ingredients is always a bonus! They help support local charities and businesses! That, I appreciate."}
{"text":"Visited the Pittsburgh area on March 28, 2015 and we like to try local spots and try to avoid the chains. I noticed this place is a local chain but that's alright. It was a Saturday afternoon and this placed is tucked away in the corner of a very busy strip mall. It took us about 10 minutes driving up and down the aisles until someone left
to park.
It was well worth it. It was packed when we walked in, however, we quickly grabbed 2 seats at the bar. The decor was really nice. We of course ordered burgers. I liked the fact that the beef is grass fed. There is a difference. The choice of building your own was incredible. We got pretty creative. One of the best burgers I've had!! Also liked the beer selection, sorry, I don't do shakes. We recommended it to some of our friends who were in town for the same event. They thought is was awesome as well.
Our server/bartender was great. She answered every question we had. Well informed. Thanks for the meal. We will be back."}
{"text":"First off ... they don't take reservations and are always packed. That isn't knocking the place, because they are that good. There is an app that my wife uses that puts your name on the wait list though.

Ok, so the burgers are very good. Although I customize my burger and have finally created the perfect burger ... that is what makes this place even better because you can go crazy with your burger.

I am not crazy about their chips, fries or other sides, but when I go here really all I want is a burger and beer (which they always have something drinkable on tap).

My wife likes the shakes and veggie burgers, but I can't really comment much on that, but I guess everyone raves about them so they must be good.

Bottom line ... if you need a big, tasty burger then come here."}
{"text":"Milkshakes are top notch. The burgers seemed to be pre made  patties.  The atmosphere seemed uptight.   5 guys is 2 doors down in the strip mall. Five guys is more bang for your buck!!"}
{"text":"We became regulars here very quickly! Love the burgers. Love the staff. The changing draft beer list is always fun to try new things! The happy hour is the best deal but honestly it's great quality food in filling portions, so it's well worth the price!"}
{"text":"The NoWait app said, \"Come on in!\" and we did. Just like the app said, we were seated immediately. The restaurant was crowded, but not packed, mid-afternoon during the holiday week. Service was good, though there was a relatively long wait between ordering and being served despite the crowd thinning out. The food arrived hot and was tasty enough, but 2 of the 3 orders were wrong. (Surprisingly, it was the 2 orders written down on their custom order form that were wrong.) One order was missing onion straws. My order was a fiddy-fiddy (50% beef - 50% bacon blend) that was to be red in the middle. Now, maybe they can't serve a fiddy-fiddy rare because of the bacon as it came out brown all the way through. And, if it was 50% bacon in the blend, I would be really surprised as there was no bacon taste to it at all and it was somewhat dry - not what I would have expected with that much bacon in it. 

If they couldn't serve it the way I asked, they should have told me before cooking it. If that wasn't the reason, then I really am disappointed that they couldn't cook it to the temp requested leading me to believe that it wasn't even the correct burger patty put on my sandwich.

The reason I am giving three stars is, despite the mix-ups, the taste was still good, but not as good as I had hoped!   

P.S. The day before, I got a perfectly rare burger at the Industry Public House."}
{"text":"The burgers were good but not good enough to wait 90 mins for. IMO go around the corner to 5 guys."}
{"text":"Absolutely great addition to the North Shore. I had some of my team members in town and ended up at this location twice and once at the one in Robinson. The Shakes are amazing (I'm sure terrible from a calorie perspective, but definitely worth every last bit. Beer Selection is not terrible (on par with what I expect, and I tend to be snobbish at times). Appetizers, the nachos were good, but the \"When Pigs Fry\" fried ribs came out. They were phenomenal, this was unbelievable. Further all of our burgers were great. I had the \"Meat Your Maker\" served as \"red\" (they do red, pink, and no pink) I was extremely happy (in fact blown away again.) I had team mates from Philly, Jersey, NY, and Virginia and they all said it was one of the top 5 burgers they've ever had so way to put Pittsburgh on the map."}
{"text":"This is the best burger I've ever had. Got the bison and it was perfect. I tried the margarita, it was awful but they took it off the check and got me a beer. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"In town to meet some old college buddies for a baseball weekend. Burgatory was close to our hotel and most had not had lunch upon arrival, so we made a mid-afternoon visit. Overall the group was more than satisfied with the speed of service and quality of food. On a personal note, my burger was top notch. Properly cooked (you build your own from a plentiful checklist of options) and presented, the flavor was better than average. I would give four stars, but the chips that accompanied the burger were kind of stale and a bit greasy. 3.5 stars from me, but the site requires whole numbers, so I went with three."}
{"text":"The burgers are quality beef, flavorful and juicy. Our waitress was the sweetest girl ever and the milkshake (we got the caramel salty pretzel one) was absolutely amazing. Will definitely be back here again!

I made my own burger and stuck with classic beef, garlic mayo, mustard, pickle, lettuce and bacon with cheddar. The burger was tender and full of flavor. Others at the table got the chicken sandwich and they loved it. Burgatory did not disappoint and is a great place to hang out with friends, have a casual date or a fun time with family. It was a great, laid back environment and some of the best milkshakes anywhere. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Holy SHIT! I like a good burger, but  this was a different level. Everyone in a while 5 Guys or In 'n' Out will do, but this is in a league of its own. Just like in college when you drank what was cheap but when you graduate and make real money you drink what is quality. This is you quality burger.

5 senses review:
Sight: 5- Nothing extraordinary. But you aren't going for the sights anyway.
Sound: 5- It is an open space with a bunch of people, but it isn't awfully loud.
Smell: 7- Lots of great smells. 
Touch: 3- This depends (clearly) on what you order and how your burger comes. 
Taste: 9- QUALITY! Meat, sauces, shakes!

If it wasn't for the great meal this rating would be lower. Only because of the damn popularity of this place. The wait would have been one hour to an hour and a half. When you have a 3 year old, that kind of wait is toooooo long. However, my wife and son went home to relax and my friend and I stayed, so we went to the bar and bypassed the wait. 

I think the greatest thing here at Burgatory is the diversity. If it is your first time, please get a burger! Even then, the choices are plentiful. If you are someone trying to maintain a \"healthy\" style of eating, you can do that. If you want to go way off the deep end of Guinness proportion calorie intake, you can do that. Choose a burger or create your own. 

I wanted an in-between experience. So I went with the topless (no top bun) grass fed Elk burger (with one of the rubs, spicy ketchup and cheese) and a Fluffer Nutter shake. The meat was amazing. Super lean, cooked perfectly and did not make me feel like I was going to fall over after eating. The shake, however did put me over the top. But it was blissful. 

Service was quick!!! 

The best tip is to make a reservation or sit at the bar. For as great as the food is, nothing is worth 1-1.5 hours of waiting."}
{"text":"First stop after I arrived home from a semester abroad in Europe. I just wanted a good ole 'murican burger. Oh man, the burger AND the milkshake were AMAZING. 10/10 would go again!"}
{"text":"So I created a burger myself and loved it for me it's the best burger in town and well worth the long waiting time for a table - sometimes 2 hours! 
What we do, but our name on the list and go shopping in the places around it you get enough time to come back. 
Also it's hard but save some room for the gorgeous milkshakes, my recommendation Campfire Smores as dessert!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, it's nice to be able to make your burger exactly what you want
But its not worth the $$$ nor the 2 hour wait

Milkshakes are good though!!"}
{"text":"The food there is sooo big! Like, woah. Big. The staff there is very friendly, and they prepared the food very quickly. It was exquisite. I made my own burger, and they cleverly disguise costs in the paper, which is cool if you look hard enough. It is also very well themed. Lastly, it was very location specific because it had references to North Park, the Trader Joes nearby, and the overpriced movie theater candy, which I found very hilarious! I will definitely be coming back to Burgatory! Oh, and the shakes are perfect!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it is always well done.  Last minute table for 14 on Black Friday, no problem!  I had,regular burger with the house dust on it and 
I added some smoked Gouda and cheddar cheese along,with some veggies and the burger was very good.  I added the fries and was lucky enough to sample a couple shakes that my daughters got!  
Been here before, and will be back again and again!  I hit the Fox?chapel location also, and I have always had good luck there too."}
{"text":"I love this place, first time there fast, friendly, patient, help. Even texted me when our table was ready."}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch before heading into work the other day. Sat at the bar and was immediately attended to. Told about the Happy hour and drink specials. Because it was before work I stuck to a sprite which always stayed full. The beer selection was enough to make me come back. I had the wings on the half off happy hour. Amazing. And the bison burger. Out of this world. Staff was awesome. Environment was cool. Food was amazing. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Caramel pretzel shake is absolutely delicious!!!!! So is the pot luck dinner burger! If you leave hungry, it's your own fault!!!!"}
{"text":"Walked right in and got a table without problem.  The wings were hot and had great taste.  The burgers were huge and full of flavor.  Our server was awesome as she made sure our drinks were filled and made sure to check on us on a consistent basis.  Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wish this place has a better beer selection.
Good food,  not many choices for vegetarians.  Have cut fries.  On tap beer was expensive $8 for a local beers."}
{"text":"Overall, I am a fan of this place. It is a super close walk to Heinz Field. Also has a ton of TVs, so you won't miss any of the game no matter where you're sitting.
Also, the food is pretty on point. I ordered the meat packer burger, which I was not a huge fan of. I feel like it just didn't have a lot of flavor. I think next time I will try the create your own burger. 
All burgers come with a side of hand made there potato chips. They were pretty good but I ordered a side of ranch dressing to help the flavor a little bit. And that cost me $.75. I think it's dumb when restaurants charge for dressings (unless someone is ordering 10 of them to go). 
I also tried the caramel pretzel milkshake. I did really enjoy that, it was a perfect balance of salty and sweet, just like the description says. Their whipped cream was very creamy and not watery (which I feel like a lot of places have that issue). 
This is not the only location for Burgatory. I do enjoy their extensive list of creating your own burgers. And their milkshakes taste fresh. Worth a go if you are a burger and milkshake fan. 
Your check will come with a fortune cookie. I thought that was really neat, until I opened it and all it said was \"buy the person on your left a milkshake\" - So kind of cute but overall wasn't as awesome as I originally thought."}
{"text":"Not the best service.  Halfway through waiting on our meal, another server went through the whole initial Burgatory experience for first timers.  We were not with our server.  While waiting (long time), we discovered the \"build your own burger menu\".  In order to get refills, I pretty much had to grab the server.  Maybe it was her and not them........"}
{"text":"Everything is usually pretty good but i feel it's very expensive for what you get. There are many burger and fry joints now with the same stuff and more affordable."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place when we were on our way into town for a hockey game. We arrived shortly after 11 am on a Friday and were seated by our waitress, Gill. She was great! The place wasn't at all crowded so she spent a good amount of time going over the menu with us and explaining all the different choices. She also made some recommendations but we ended up building our own burgers which was a little overwhelming. The black and gold shake was great. The burgers were perfectly cooked and we enjoyed being able to customize them. The fries were edible but not great. The housemade chips were awesome! Overall, we were happy with our meals and service but it is definitely a little pricy for a burger joint and after we ordered it seemed to take a while for the food to come out considering that there were only a few tables filled."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Burgatory but in the past couple of times, it's been disappointing. The food wasn't that good especially the burger buns. The Herbed focaccia is especially bad and it tastes like stale bread. The meat is good as per the usual.
Also, the wait was exceptionally long. I don't mind it when the food is good, but it hasn't. I'm disappointed because for the longest time, it was my favorite Pittsburgh burger place."}
{"text":"First time and probably last, I would give this place one star but the waitress was nice enough. The food was bland greasy and over done. The set up was uncomfortable and dark. This place had identity crisis written all over it they sell burgers have a bar and finish with a fortune cookie? Stay away if you want to save 50 bucks"}
{"text":"My husband has been traveling to Pittsburg for a year now and every time he comes home he talks about how good this place is. Well I finally traveled to Pittsburgh to check it out. I started out with a choco taco shake, very very yummy! Next I had the fries with Truffled Gorgonzola, oh my gosh they were yummy melted in my mouth. We also tried the FIRE KISSED SRIRACHA WINGS, the sauce was very nice, so tasty. Then we had the burgers (yummy yummy yummy) try the elk, you will not be disappointed. Overall this place was great. Great food, service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I haven't had Burgatory for years! But it is still tasty just like the first time that i had! 
I ordered a create-your-own burger with chicken and \"top-less\" bun. Most people would get beef for their burger meat, but if you'd like to have something light and not too greasy, I would recommend the chicken for your burger! It's just great! And \"top-less\" bun is good option for small appetites. I also added extra guacamole for $1.5, it's a perfect match! But the amount of guacamole could fill up little bit more."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced for average quality food & service. Build your own burger is creative, but nowhere close to being worth up to $15. The milkshakes, in short, are bad. Not worth it - try the place across the street."}
{"text":"Finally! I made the trek out to Burgatory for what is supposed to be one of the best burger experiences in Pittsburgh. This place has what it takes to be the best but our meal fell a little short. 

We had to wait 45 minutes to be seated, I have no problem because they have a bar with some great beer choices at reasonable prices. What I did have a problem with was that they use a computer based system that will text you what your wait time is once you arrive and give them your telephone number. I waited exactly 45 minutes until I received a text that my table was ready. Not 40 or 50 minutes but exactly 45 minutes which is what I was told by the waitstaff upon arrival. I find that interesting, is it a scam to get you to go to the bar and spend more? Something to think about. The few wines they offer(2) they will pour a generous $6 glass.

Once we were seated at one of their high top tables. We were sweating our tails off because they had the garage door entrance to the patio area wide open. It is 95 degrees out and if I wanted to dine outside I would have asked to be seated in the patio area or stayed home and grilled my own burger. The burger was A-OK for this reason, way overcooked. Was by no means moist or juicy. It did have overall good flavor but, to have a truly awesome burger int needs to be both seasoned properly and also show that some skill and care was taken to actually heat that hunk of meat to perfection. The ingredients burgatory have are obviously top notch but honestly what's the point if you cant cook the the meat properly. 

Service at Burgatory was very quick and my order accuracy outside of the burger being overcooked was right on.  Will I make the trek back out to Burgatory? Probably not but I will stop by if I'm in the area and there isn't a wait."}
{"text":"We were told that the wait was gonna be 1.5hrs, usually you think it won't actually be that long but in this case it was everybit of what they said, but with all the hype that this place received I thought well it must be worth the wait. So after killing time they finally texted us that our table was ready, our server was excellent, very knowledgeable and curteous. We decided to get an appetizer of the Bangkok Steak Fries, which were actually tempura fried portebello mushrooms, they were excellent to say the least. I ordered the buffaloed byson burger and the wife ordered the phat patti's veggie burger. We received our meals pretty promptly and everything was what we expected, but I have got to say that in my opinion this place is a bit \"Over-hyped\", I mean don't get me wrong the food was good but maybe I just set my expectations a little bit too high.  Maybe next time we will go at a different time of the day when it isn't as busy, we would try it again but it won't be anytime soon as I know of alot of burger places that surpass Burgatory as a premier \"Gourmet\" burger joint."}

{"text":"Wow! Yum! After eating lots of mediocre homemade veggie burgers or reheated boca burgers throughout my life, I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious my meal was. This was the best veggie burger I've had in Pittsburgh, and among my top 3 ever. It's hearty with great flavor. It's fun to customize the burger by choosing from countless toppings. The pretzel bun paired perfectly with the burger. I've tried the focaccia which was pretty good but didn't complement the burger as well. The side salad (for an extra $1.5) is a large mix of spring greens with Parmesan and was delicious - worth it. 

They also have a great selection of milkshakes and non-burger entrees which I've heard are great as well. 

I've taken my mom too and she loved the chicken burger with the gluten free bun. She's tried a lot of GF foods and liked this bun so much she ate it before I could even try it. 

My waiters are always friendly and kept our glasses full. The decorations give the restaurant a fun atmosphere. 

Overall: 5/5 for vegetarians and it's a place where almost everyone can find something. Go."}
{"text":"This review is for shakes only. But they are really good shakes. We stopped after dinner for a booze/dessert nightcap and got the Apple Pancakes and Bacon and the Choco's Taco. Both delicious and big. We will have to try the burgers sometime."}
{"text":"Burgatory is one of my favorite spots.  Each time I get something different, which makes dinner more fun and creative when you can make your own burgers.

Follow them on facebook for Burger Of The Day updates.

Oh, and try the truffle fries - they are a $5 bucket of heaven!"}
{"text":"in the category of burger places, this is great... loved the fries & two burgers we ordered, can't wait for return trip (we're out of towners) to work our way thru the menu and likely try one or two of those shakes... Erin ranks up there as one of the best servers EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Great Steakhouse Burger.
Wife loved the NEW Impossible Burger 
Lots of Shakes and real nice looking 

Near the Ballparks"}
{"text":"Went to visit Pittsburgh for 4 days and loved coming here.  Had an awesome waiter named Connor.  The guacamole is fantastic and so are their burgers.  Wish they had one in NYC!"}
{"text":"Delicious. The atmosphere is very casual and fun. You can make your own burger/sandwich whatever you want. A lot of the toppings are a $1 so you have to watch because it can rack up pretty fast. It feels a bit to expensive when the bill comes. For two people our bill came to $50 with tip for two burgers a basket of fries and a milkshake. Going home with all of our extra fries and half a burger though. The milkshakes are so good, and my favorite. Would recommend saving room for dessert."}
{"text":"If you're not familiar with the Burgatory restaurants you have to go at least once. Obviously their specialty is hamburgers. You can create your own (recommended) using different types of beef and other ground meat like elk. They have different types of buns from brioche to pretzel rolls. Large selection of toppings and they offer adult milkshakes (espresso love is my favorite). They have fresh cut fries and the jalapeño corn bread is awesome. The place is clean, casual and the staff is friendly. Be warned it is expensive."}
{"text":"I love Burgatory. It's expensive, but the burgers are fresh and there are lots of gourmet options. There are rolls like brioche; toppings like habanero jelly- yum. The jalapeño corn bread is amazing and they have adult milkshakes with alcohol. Espresso Love is my favorite."}
{"text":"They made one of the better burgers that I've had and cooked it bloody rare as requested. I chose to make my own burger and it did not disappoint. I got the caramel pretzel milkshake and it was also extremely tasty and filling. My fiance got the crab burger and said it was very good. My only complaint was how expensive it was."}
{"text":"The greeter asked me if I wanted a kids menu and I am extremely offended then went of to make fun of my height. Bugs were flying around my food which was absolutely disgusting but it doesn't help that we were right outside the restrooms. The whole time the greeters would stare at us and giggle which triggered my anxiety. The food was aight."}
{"text":"So glad yelp lead me here!  Awesome food and wait staff.  Try the 'skip line' feature... it works!"}
{"text":"I had an absolutely fantastic experience at the Burgatory in Murraysville, PA. I had the Elk Gone Wild burger which was made to perfection, medium pink and juicy all the way through and just the right amount of spice and flavor with bacon jam, smoked gouda cheese, sautéed onions. My waitress was excellent, and she refilled my drink 3 times for no charge. I had a strawberry basil spritzer, normally made with alcohol but since I got it non-alcoholic I was only charged for the price of a lemonade. Nice! The atmosphere is fun and casual. I would definitely go back and hope to while I'm still in school near Pgh."}
{"text":"Very good unusual milkshakes great burgers the buffalo burger is great. Prices are a little higher then normal but still not bad. Check there web site for wait times it could be an hour just to get seated but there is alot of shopping around. Would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"BE SURE YOU GO HUNGRY.  Although it is expensive for a college student's budget the amount of food you get and the quality is absolutely AMAZING.  Seriously one of the best cheeseburgers I have ever had and the best part was I got to customize it myself.  Don't be boring and get a water or soda, go for the milkshake!! Their milkshakes are just as good if not better than their burgers. Only complaint is the long wait, so be prepared if you're going on a Friday or Saturday."}
{"text":"My wife loves burgers and when I want to take her to a burger place this is where we go.  They never disappoint.  Fries are awesome and when we do get drinks the bar is a cool place to chill for a little while."}
{"text":"I went to Burgatory in Homestead for the first time last week and I love it!! First off, the staff is all very friendly there and the service is good! Once you get seated there's a tablet where you mark off everything you want on your burger, you \"make your own burger.\" There's also a menu that you can pick a sandwich that is already pre made. It can get a little pricey if you check off a lot of stuff for your burger. It's totally worth it! Everything was so good! I got the caramel pretzel shake for dessert and it was incredible! I will definitely go back to Burgatory again. I would like to try other locations as well."}
{"text":"Horrible hostesses - keep in mind, these are the faces of your restaurant.  I went After a steelers game - I know it's busy, that's fine. I hadn't been before and just wanted take out.  When I got in a girl at the front was on a tablet and just looked at me.  She kept looking so I asked I she worked here and she asked if I wanted a table.  I just wanted a take out menu and she gave it to me.  I looked for a minute and tried to find out who to talk to to order, and when I asked someone, she said the bar, looked at her phone and walked away.  I asked another girl right there where the bar was and she just walked away.  I followed the beer taps to the back of the bar and ordered... despite just wanting to walk out, this staff was fine.  
I got a milkshake, chili, and guac chips.  The food was all perfectly fine - not the best ever (chili didn't actually have much flavor), but really fairly priced (21.00) I'd go back for the food, but unfortunately, the service would send me somewhere else."}
{"text":"Custom make a burger and get an awesome milkshake,  what isn't to love. I stopped in over my lunch hour and had to rush out because it took a while for the order to come out. Very good and very filling!"}
{"text":"This is one of the places that I miss most about living in Pittsburgh (moved back to Cleveland about a year ago). Every time I go back to the city, I need to either get a burger or a shake from there, no matter how late it might make me to something. I am obsessed with its caramel pretzel shake. It is to die for -- I highly recommend it. Food-wise, I am obsessed with the 'meat your maker' burger. You cannot go wrong with it. The food is always done to perfection, and the fries are crispy and golden. You might have to wait a little while, and since they don't take reservations, I highly recommend downloading the \"nowait\" app, so you can jump in line and not have to wait in line at the restaurant if it's a long wait. I can't wait to go back to Pittsburgh and grab another shake, or meal, while I am there, from Burgatory."}
{"text":"The motto you get what you pay for doesn't hold true here!  Let's start with draft beer choices...way to many IPAs for me...but, if an IPA is your thing this would be a great choice.  Now to what they are known for...the BURGER!  Was it good?  Yes!!  Was it $13 + good... NO!  The concept is good!  Order a burger the way you want it.  You get to choose the meat, cheese, rub, toppings and bun.  Just be careful!  Many of the adds (ie cheese) are at an additional charge.  So, before you know it the $$$ add up!  Although I must say my husband and son rave about the burger so if price is not an issue or you would like to order a burger the way you want it is worth the stop!  The service was good and atmosphere is lively!"}
{"text":"My opinion may not matter but, being as I've never been here until yesterday and the fact I hate burgers could also reflect my stars ... 

We went after the Pirates game on our way home. We were seated quickly and our waiter came over and asked if we had been there. Everyone in my party had been but, I. I found the menu and choices a little overwhelming. I asked if they could make the burger a little smaller (I'd still pay full price but, I wanted to try it and he declined) the milkshakes were wonderful but, hardly worth the price. The burger even with all the rubs had no flavor. It was mediocre at best. I was very unimpressed with our overall visit and I know that I will never be returning."}
{"text":"It. Is. Incredible.

Start to finish.

Service is understandably sluggish due to the nature of custom burgers and the overall crowd, but I couldn't recommend it any higher.  It rivals only Shake Shack on my power ranking of burgers."}
{"text":"We had an early dinner at this Burgatory. Already pretty busy around 5pm on a Saturday. We had a short wait for a pretty crowded place. 

The environment is really busy, noisy with the Air Conditioning on 50F. This place is too loud for normal conversation and I found it to be hopping a little too much for a family.

The milkshakes were delicious but really filling for how much food was still on its way. 

The holy mole guac was fresh and delicious but there were not enough chips, although they were hot and fresh. 

The burgers were all around good including one with gouda, short ribs, and onion rings on top of a well cooked patty. The fries were good but not included....you get chips without upsizing.

Who doesn't eat fries with their burgers?!

Anyways I found the place just a bit too much for a family: too loud, too over the top.....for a couple of young guys/girls on the town, sure.

4 stars cause the food is fairly solid."}
{"text":"First time here-came while visiting my brother. We checked in through a friends app before we left so once we got there we only had to wait about 10 minutes. The atmosphere was pretty cool. Our server was very helpful and had many suggestions. Their alcoholic milkshakes were decent-I had the chocolate caramel. For diner I decided to go with something a bit different and got the crab-shack burger. It was awesome! All in all we had a really good experience and would recommend."}
{"text":"Went out one evening recently for 1st time after all the hype in town calmed down. Not good for families with children. Too loud to hear any one of us even while yelling. Server was good. Food was good but not worth the price at all. Fries were ok. Was a special occasion for us and this was the place picked. We even used the no wait app and waited 1.5 hrs for a mediocre table (not exactly big enough for our party, not enough seats). Won't be back. We will stick to red robin."}
{"text":"We waited weeks and drove nearly 500 miles to try the Impossible Burger at the Burgatory. It was worth every bite. 

During a Thanksgiving trip to Pittsburgh we stopped off at Burgatory to try this new meatless burger created by Silicon Valley startup Impossible Foods. I read about the Impossible Burger in the Wall Street Journal and read an article about it in Wired magazine. 

Let me say this is not at all like a veggie burger. The consistency and taste is as close to meat as I've ever seen. The flavor was outstanding. 

The Burgatory allows you to customize your burger. I had mine on a brioche bun with grilled onions, a grilled pineapple and honey habanero sauce. My wife and two daughters also had their own customized Impossible Burgers. There was a lot of munching and not a lot of talking during dinner. I can't speak highly enough of how fantastic these burgers are. 

The ambience in Burgatory was great. My daughters ordered $6.50 milk shakes.  I felt a little like Vince Vega at Jack Rabbit Slims in Pulp Fiction. They were pretty darn good shakes. 

Ironically there is another burger joint right across the street at the Burgatory location we visited. The restaurant was full and there was a long line of people waiting to get into the Burgatory but the other place was half empty. A pretty good indication of which place you want to go to."}
{"text":"Totally surprised at this one!  Visiting with a friend from out of town and we were chilling at Panera studying when we looked over and saw \"Burgatory\".  Great name and a Devilish cow to entice you in.  We kind of felt that we had to check out since they were touted such a name.  Much to our skeptical surprise we loved it.  We both had Beef Burgers and they simply rocked.  The fried were fresh and tasty too.  I had an alcoholic milkshake and my only complaint was the size of the straw.  You could park your motorhome in this thing if you wanted to!   We went back the next day and I got the crab burger....not as great as the beef, but still a solid sandy.  I am super critical when it comes to burgers, and I have to say their beef burgers ranked very high on my list.   Rock On Devil Cow!"}
{"text":"Burgatory is one of the better burgers in Pittsburgh, when cooked well. I've always gone the custom route which includes some variety of avacado, lettuce, tomatos, fried egg, grilled onions, and chipotle sour cream (which is no longer on the custom menu, but you can still order it). And I always get the black peppercorn rub. When I do have room for a shake, which isn't often, I really enjoy the peanut butter shake (fluffer nutter? I can't remember off the top of my head).

In comparison to other burger establishments in the area, they really lack on their sides. Chips are \"OK\" but always seem to be rock-hard and you usually only get 1 or 2 sweet potato chips. Fries are sub-par and try as I might, I do not like their \"organic\" side salad option.

Some of my bigger complaints is how they prepare your burger. It doesn't matter what temperature state you order your burger (pink, some pink, no pink), it ALWAYS comes in-between pink and some pink, which means blood soaking up in the bun. I was even advised to order \"no pink\" on my last visit, to which I did, and it still was almost rare. 

And from a custom menu standpoint, I don't understand some of their pricing - the burger is certainly big, but $1.00 for grilled onions? Especially when they are just purple onions that have barely been sauteed, let alone caramelized. 

Staff is hit or miss, and I won't forget the time their Twitter rep argued with me about an experience I had with slippery floors, odd as that sounds."}
{"text":"Over the years, I've found myself coming here less and less. As far as burgers go, there are many better options in the area - although their free birthday shake always gets me in the door. 

I've always only ever ordered custom burgers, and they tend to be hit or miss from how they are cooked to how much of each topping provided. I tend to enjoy them, but rarely do I crave to go here - which is what the best burger places tend to do.

The staff at this particular location are incredibly friendly though, so you won't be disappointed for a visit."}
{"text":"This is our favorite relax and grab a meal place. We loved it at the Waterworks Mall but it is even better here.  The staff is friendly and informative.  Their chicken burgers are fantastic...a ton of flavor!  We have tried several things on the menu and have never been disappointed.  We like eating at the bar because the bartenders are favorites!  It is well run and the atmosphere is relaxed and friendly.  You will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service every time that I have been here.  Normally get the Crab Shack or Meat Your Maker.  Both are amazing."}
{"text":"Burgatory... the name speaks for itself... you walk in expecting a tasty burger, but due to a terrible hostess, piss poor management you end up in limbo for far to long watching other parties go ahead of your group. Can't even review the food because of the incompetence of the service. Burn in Hades Burgatory..."}
{"text":"That burger was amazing! I will be back! I made my own, had the dry aged wagyu beef and topped it with all kinds of goodies including the buffalo cheddar and the bacon jam. Best burger I have ever had. We also loved the guac."}
{"text":"We tried to get into Burgatory with out of town visitors a few months ago, but didn't want to wait the 2 hour quoted time. We went back last weekend to see what all the excitement was. We both enojoyed our burgers, but weren't blown away by them. My husband's burger was over cooked and dried out. Mine was tasty, but still didn't seem worth the $13. The truffled gorgonzola fries were fantastic!"}
{"text":"This location is spacious and really like that there is plenty of booth seating.  I love this setup!  The seating at the robinson location is too close together.   I prefer to have some type of distance between myself and others that are in the restaurant.  Our visit was around lunch time 12:30.   I was surprised we didn't have to wait for a table, however; we did wait about 20 minutes for our food.    I got my usual burger (custom - pictured) and it was delicious as always.  I love the selection of fries especially the Truffled Gorgonzola for $8.00.  Perfect size to share! 

$5.00 Parking in the closest lot.   I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of burgers so love burgatory for their made to order burgers and great menu.  

I have tasted almost every milkshake they make they are out of this world. I think they just recently changed the shape of their fries.. they are no longer those skinny - tiny fries they are the regular size.
The one thing that I don't care for is the seating setup.  Everyone is practically sitting on top of one another. When I go out to eat it's an experience.  I do not wish to sit 2 inches away from a stranger while I am trying to have a conversation with the party I am with.   The restaurant is a bit noisy for my taste and wish there were more booths and tables that aren't so close together.   Other than this reason I love the food and will return - but will sit at the bar or a high top table."}
{"text":"short and to the point

Great creative hamburger menu (they have a build your own burger menu too).  Dynamite shake selection, and cool looking appetizers.  

I had the Steakhouse burger which was packed with juiciness and flavor.  Each bite was better than the next.  Both the chips and the fries served as perfect accompaniments.   

The next night I went with the Crabcake burger.  Unbelievably good.   Tasted like a true crabcake instead of filler and peppers.   Huge portions too.  

Go with the Brioche bread, its a burgers best friend. 

An hour wait on the weekends.  

Cant wait to go back and try something else

just look at the menu on the website and you will fall in love with hell.

PS.  Only microbeers on tap."}
{"text":"Burgatory Always Reels Me Back In...

I have been going to Burgatory since they first opened. I have been to almost all of their locations and can say the food, atmosphere and milkshakes are all very consistent (Thats a good thing) 

I have tried almost everything on the menu (we ordered Burgatory for at work often) and can say there really isn't a bad item on the menu! I would recommend sticking to one of their signature burgers, trust me they know what they're doing! 

The deep fried ribs appetizer is out of this world! I believe its called \"when pigs fry\" It recently replaced my old favorite appetizer the deep fried portobello mushrooms womp womp. I was a little bummed out until I tried the replacement, I no longer miss the mushrooms! 

Make sure you save room for a milkshake because they are the final touch to this nearly perfect meal! I am pretty sure they can make any shake (even the alcoholic ones) non alcoholic. 

All in all Burgatory is a win win if you are looking for a great burger joint in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! I work a few minutes from Burgatory so I have been blessed with being able to come here more times than I would like to admit. I am not even kidding when I say you can close your eyes, point to the menu and be 100% satisfied with whatever you get. It's good to know they also use grass fed beef & mostly organic ingredients. If you are debating on where to eat and Burgatory is an option then look no further! I HIGHLY recommend this place!!! A+"}
{"text":"The first time we ate at Burgatory, we split the fantastic nachos and two burgers - Morty's and Meat your Maker. I left there and confidently said that the Meat your Maker was the absolute best burger I've ever had. (And this is no knock to Morty's - it came in a close second!) The aged dried wagyu beef is nothing short of amazing. On our second trip, we decided to try out the Piggy Butter & Jelly, which seems more like a novelty item - something you want to try to say that you tried it. As it turns out, the PB&J burger gives Meat your Maker a run for its money. It may seem like a novelty burger but it's actually a genius creation that absolutely everybody needs to try to believe. The flavors work together in perfect harmony and I guarantee you, you will be craving it months later. I am! 

It's going to be difficult to stray from the Meat your maker and the PB&J on our next visit, but I have it on good authority that the Trippin' Chicken is too good to pass up. 

They do have some happy hour appetizer and beer specials, making it impossible to leave there hungry. The nachos are a real standout on the app menu. The wings are just so-so (sauce doesn't have quite enough zing to it) but to me, it doesn't matter much. You don't go there for wings. 

Burgatory makes my Top 5 restaurant list, without a doubt. My only complaint is that it has ruined me for burgers pretty much EVERYWHERE else. I figure, why bother ordering one at another restaurant? It will only leave me wishing I were at Burgatory."}
{"text":"I went here once with my friends (This is a great group place!) and it was overall a good experience.

Honestly, the menu was a bit overwhelming for me (as someone who enjoys simple things) but I appreciate the array of choices they offer.

The food was a bit pricey in my opinion but the atmosphere and service make up for the cost.

Would come again if I'm ever craving a fancier burger and milkshake."}
{"text":"We decided to go to the recently opened Burgatory for a few good burgers at the Blue Spruce location. I immediately took a mental note of the rare drive thru Starbucks adjacent to Burgatory. We checked in and provided a number to text us in 20 minutes or so when our table was ready. Meanwhile, a decent sized wine & spirits store was a few doors down so we browsed around, picked up a few bottles if wine and received a text from Burgatory that they were ready to seat us. The atmosphere is lively with 20 or so TVs surrounding the bar, seating all around it and a bustling staff. I ordered the Meat Your Maker burger and hubby ordered a standard deluxe burger with bacon.  The friendly waiter recommended the Just Fork It...which is fries with pan gravy, braised short ribs and cheddar cheese curds--yummm! The burgers were scrumptious, with fresh ingredients and served with tasty homemade seasoned potato chips. This was a very hearty meal with the fries, which was a meal in itself. Everything was aboveboard and the staff was very friendly! I'd highly recommend Burgatory and the Blue Spruce location!"}
{"text":"First time eating here in general. Went on a Friday, their was a 20 min wait, which isn't bad and they take your number and text/call when a table is ready. 

Opposed to awkwardly sitting there waiting, we took advantage of the notification system and chose to check out some shops for a bit. 

Our table was ready in time and we were seated promptly. Our waiter was really helpful with any questions we had about the menu too! We both opted to build our own burger, she got fries with and I tried the jalapeño corn bread. She was drinking the siesta sangria and I had a mark and stormy followed by a southern charm. Everything was really good. 

Definitely recommend this place and location!"}
{"text":"Great food, and always fast, friendly service.  The milkshakes are to DIE for!  Another great meal this evening."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally try here.  I was let down. I ordered My hormone free burger with no pink and it was super dry.

And the grease, oh God, the grease. The fries and portobello mushrooms were laden in it.

They nailed the shake, though. Nailed it."}
{"text":"I don't get why people love it here so much.  The burgers are bland and always overdone.  Their appetizers are all either spicy or just not good.  Do yourself a favor and head to Stack'd in Wexford."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a big party. Its a fun looking restaurant. The food is pretty good. Burgers are $10-$15. Shakes are $6. Kind of pricey for what you get but its not bad food. You're just paying the hipster upcharge.

I got a burger with a bunch of weird shit on it. I'm normally a normal burger kind of guy...mustard onions and pickles. I got a bunch of weird shit on it and told them to make it bloody as fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. It was barely bloody but they don't cook to temp, they have you pick red/pink/not pink. Whatevs.

The shakes were pretty good. Not sure they're worth six bucks but, once again, hipster upcharge.

The atmosphere is decent. The food is decent. For a trendy spot, this ain't that bad."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best places to get a burger--especially a veggie burger. This place is CRAZY delicious. It is one of the best meals I've ever had. Their milkshakes are simply unbelievable--especially their smores. There are a ton of options and even for a burger joint, it is super vegetarian friendly! Be prepared to leave extremely satisfied with a large food-baby."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I went a couple of weeks ago after a bodybuilding show I competed in and couldn't get to Burgatory fast enough. I'd had it bookmarked for weeks! I had the Pig and Jelly burger which has a super thick patty (bacon baked right in), candied bacon, jalepeno jelly, and peanut butter. I know it sounds crazy, but it so worked. I loved every bite. A friend and I shared one of the shakes. It was good but NOT great. Not worth the $6. The burger and fries on the other hand hit the spot. Just wish they had sweet taters. I'd go back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Burgatory! I love their milkshakes especially the salted carmel pretzel. You also gotta love their appetizer fries that have gravy on it. I could have had the milkshake and the fries alone and I would have been just as happy but then the burger comes and it feels almost like a burger Thanksgiving with all the good food. Definitely one of the one things I love about living in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Came here for a midweek lunch with coworkers. The place was busy but we didn't have to wait for a table. It was my first visit and I loved many aspects of the design and feel of the place. Hip, modern, cool. Love the pads where you check off what you want on the burger.  Lately, I feel like I have been seeing a lot of servers trying to pull off the memorization approach, and failing. Disappointing for all involved. So why not put it in writing?

Though I eat meat, I was in a healthy kind of mood and got the Phat Patti burger. While all the ingredients were tasty, the patty started falling apart nearly on first bite, getting progressively worse through the meal. I ended up eating it with a fork after it completely disintegrated. Good ingredients, but the execution could be optimized. The chips that came with the burger were delish. And, of course, those milkshakes. Again, at the tail end of a week of birthday celebrations, I couldn't imagine eating one more bite than I did, but I've heard they're great, and will stop by again to try more of the offerings."}
{"text":"Good selection of beers and menu items. The burgers are superb and the fries are delicious but the shakes, they're to die for. The staff is friendly and organized, food turn around times are quick and your drink won't go empty. I had the Elk burger and was pleasantly surprised how good it was. Prices are on the higher end for burger joints but I feel are worth it. Give this place a try but save room for a shake."}
{"text":"The first time I stopped here I was very underwhelmed. But then why all the hype? So I waited to review this place until I could go back. And so:
I realized that I just don't care for the atmosphere at this restaurant. The shake was great, the burger was good, and the service was prompt. I should want to say that this is a great place for good bar food. And it is good bar food. It's just not a bar/restaurant that makes me want to be there... too corporately sterile? I don't know... I guess there are just so many better places to get a good burger."}
{"text":"The name alone says everything! 

When I first passed this spot, I was like hmmm interesting concept. Going in, it was everything I wanted it to be!!!

Again, on a trip with the fam, we stayed across the street from this joint and i love to visit off the chain places.

And this place is just that! It seems they thought of everything! The decor! The slogans, the garage door patio, the milkshakes, the burger menu, i mean...what don't they do!?!

I didn't have an adult beverage, but I would imagine they were good too!

The little had the hot dog and deconstructed it and still loved it. 

I got the Steak/Morton burger and it was good. It was even good 3 hours later on the highway! Lots of onion straws. I could've used maybe a little more cheese.

DH made his own burger and thank God that was an option.

An to end it...I got the Carmel pretzel milkshake. Like...how do the pieces of the pretzel stay whole an not soggy in the glass (and a half) you get of it. My daughter said they use special \"permenant\" prezels that never get soft. She may be right!

The fries were actually the BEST thing on the menu to me. I need a week to just try stuff from this place. But the fries...perfection.

I miss you already Burgatory. Being bad never tasted so good! (is that they're slogan because I seriously just made that up)."}
{"text":"I have stopped here several times after shopping at Ikea and will continue to go back.  Their bison burger is the best I've had when eating out.  I love the build your own burger option.  We also ordered the nachos, which were really good and enough food to feed 4 or more.  The service is always good and the staff friendly.  Even for a packed Saturday night, the wait was not long.  The fries are not my favorite, but they have many other options for sides.  Their prices are reasonable and you leave stuffed with to-go boxes.  They also had a great selection of beers."}
{"text":"Holy cow - this place is worth the wait!

If you can get a seat at the bar, they will serve you there. 

I always build my own burger, the smoked gouda or the gorgonzola cheeses are my go-to. Don't hesitate to pay the extra bit for seasoned french fries!

Want a little kick in your milk shake? The Nutella Crunch with Chocolate Vodka is. to. die. for. (You can definitely share these shakes, folks!)"}
{"text":"The wait time wasn't bad and it was neat that they text you when their ready to seat you. I hated my seating location - felt I was mostly in the way! I got a expresso love milkshake -you could definitely taste the Patrón! I also got a bison burger, topless..the burger was slightly too pink, borderline rare...but it was good. I made my selections on the menu card so ordering was simple and quick. The server was nice and prompt! I would go back to try other shakes and burger combinations."}
{"text":"Burgatory....you had me at boozy milkshakes. 

Overall, I dig this place, and my fiance loves it! I'm not as crazy about burgers, but I usually do the ground chicken and I really enjoy it. You can create your own, which I'm always a fan of and they have some decent options that you don't see everywhere like truffled shallot aioli and gruyere cheese.

Although this place is known for it's burgers, I'm actually a bigger fan of the nachos (get them, you'll thank me later) and the shakes. 

The downsides? It's generally a huge wait, it's often loud, and if you end up seated in the tent area in one of the high top tables, you have no where to put your belongings (read: purse). 

Overall, it's a great spot for a delicious burger and shake."}
{"text":"Make to order burgers. Pick your meat, your rub, your cheese, your bread/roll and your toppings and sauces. Make it the way you wish you could at home. Great shakes too, even ones with alcohol. I've been here many times and never had a bad burger or fries. Very busy so try to get there early, especially if the Steelers, Pirates or Penguins are playing that day. This location is in the heart of an awesome shopping complex, a great retreat !"}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place in the US. Travelled here last year and was really impressed. Came here three days in a row on this year's trip and it's like it's better every day. Glad I live so far away or I would be like 600lbs."}
{"text":"Ate at the Consol Energy Center for a Penguins game. Dry, over cooked and cold. Chips were cold. It looked great, the smell was awesome, the line was long for an expensive, bad food choice. The restaurant must be better but this was terrible. The chicken sandwich that my daughter had was great though. 
They grabbed our food from a line of pre-staged orders and that was the problem. Eat before you arrive at the game."}
{"text":"My work had a food truck day and Burgatory was one of the vendors. I was excited to try them as their menu looked great. After waiting about 15 mins my order was ready!!!....No so exciting.

The burger is small, just slightly bigger than a slider. The burger itself was burnt, not hockey puck burnt but still burnt enough. Most of the dish is just fries (not the greatest either). 
I was really disappointed but I will consider giving them a second change, maybe the restaurant will be better). 

Im on the fence only because my first experience was not great and the burgers are pricey so it didn't help that I felt ripped off. 

Till next time.

XOXO, Happy Eats!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I've had in the Burgh. The meat was perfect, the toppings were perfect, the bun was to die for and even the side salad was by far the best side salad I've ever had. 

Just make sure you save room for a shake! 

They even made fortune cookies taste good. That's an accomplishment."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try Burgatory for YEARS. I was not wow-ed or disappointed. I was unGODly full from my meal. True. I got a burger, fries, and a shake. Which is a lot of food. But from what I understand it's ludicrous to come here and not get a shake. So I was full. The food was good and tasty but we agreed that next time for the two of us we should share a meal rather than each having our own because the portions are pretty hefty. Plus, they're expensive. So I'll be back with a different strategy.

As a P.S. we used the OpenTable app to get a table since that's what they do and while the app said we were next in line and had one minute to wait, we ended up waiting about 5 extra minutes while other people were seated ahead of us, even though we checked in twice. So that could probably use some work."}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was delicious. We ordered a milkshake which was good, I've had better but I'd order one again from there. It wasn't jam packed with flavor, but it was large and perfect consistency. Perhaps another flavor would  be better.  Food was awesome, prices fair. I would go back and eat again....go hungry! Large portions!"}
{"text":"Fabulous burgers, fries and shakes! Loved the idea of creating your own burger starting with what kind of meat to put on it! All the options for create your own were fabulous, which made it hard to choose! Everytime you go can be a whole new experience! Fun atmosphere too. Our server was awesome! sorry, I forgot his name :( 
He was so helpful with the menu and suggestions. We  would definitely go back whenever we are in the Burg again!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite chains. Had the trippin' chicken burger and a weekend special shake. Burger was moist and well seasoned.  Milkshake was made with fresh fruit and spiked with bubbly. Overall, too much food next time I will pick, shake or burger, not both!"}
{"text":"Best burger  - anywhere!  And the fries, fresh, flavorful and not greasy.  The baked beans are anything but the usual and delicious. Sangria, was refreshing, but save your calorie count for the homemade milkshakes and adulterize it ;-) I'm just sayn'.  We ate at two different locations on our long weekend, because why mess with success?"}
{"text":"The smores milkshake is the best! And the waygu burger is fantastic. I love the pot roast fries and the salads are always fresh. Jordyn is wonderful, you're in luck if you get a table in her section."}
{"text":"Went here with wife while traveling through Pittsburgh.   The place was seriously happening at 3:15PM.   We were seated right away and the server was fantastic and attentive throughout our entire visit.

They have a create your own burger checklist that is easy to follow, you fill one out if you want a burger your own custom way.   They have plenty of standard selections as well if you are lazy.

I'm vegan so we started with they Holy Moly which is chips and Guac and it was delicious.   I got the Impossible Burger patty with Vegan Cheddar (they have vegan cheese!   You believe that!   Most restaurants don't care about vegans or vegetarian explicitly, they have several options for us!).  I got all the fixings, including avocado.

No BS, that was seriously freaking delicious.   I have no idea why this place has so many mediocre reviews and 3 stars.   Check them out, if we were staying longer I would be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Always a good experience- I tend to make a custom burger each time we come, while my boyfriend has picked a different of their menu creations -  our meals have all been delicious. For me half a burger is enough to fill me up, so I always have enough to take home to enjoy the next day. Sides - fries, union rings (huge), and the potato/sweet potato chips that come with the burgers are good options. We weren't huge fans of the baked beans, a little too spicy and BBQ'y for our liking. By far my favorite topping to get on my burger is the shallot truffle aioli; it is so good I could eat it with a spoon."}
{"text":"I've had better burgers in Pittsburgh. The concept of building your own personalized burger is cool and all, but the extra $2.50 I paid for a skimpy portion of \"smoked\" bacon and grilled pineapple made my creation far from worth it. 

My friend highly recommends the chaco taco milkshake, however.

The waitresses are a bit on the frosty side as well."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town. Very good shakes. Good bar menu. Very good service for a burger joint."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I don't usually eat out because she has celiac's disease, but Burgatory is one of our favorite restaurants to visit because they offer good gluten-free buns. We were in the area and stopped at this location for the first time. The service was very slow, the quality of the food wasn't nearly as good as the food at other Burgatory restaurants, and my girlfriend's food was cross-contaminated by gluten and she got very sick once we got home. I will not recommend this particular location to anybody who wants to dine in Robinson. I also would like to warn celiacs to avoid this Burgatory."}
{"text":"I left the city of Pittsburgh shortly after the opening of the first Burgatory. The concept intrigued, but I never had the opportunity to check it out. Since then, the burger spot has expanded into a sort of micro chain, which meant that their offerings tasted good enough to attract substantial clientele. A recent weekend trip to Pittsburgh provided a great chance to check out the newest location at the much more convenient Waterfront and see what the fuss was about.

Fortunately, my experience matched the hype I had heard of. We had a 25 minute wait during peak Saturday lunch hours, which was not bad considering the popularity of these restaurants. Our party started off with Burgatory's beer battered onion rings and jalapeno-bacon-cheddar fries as appetizers. The onion rings' enormous size reflected the beer batter's substantial flavor. Though a bit greasy, they are not to be missed. Ditto for the jalapeno-cheddar-bacon fries, which lost minor marks for flavorless cheddar.

The wealth of customizable burger options can leave one perplexed, so the less decisive/knowledgeable should order one of Burgatory's excellent house burgers. My companions' pot roast and steakhouse burgers both delivered tons of flavor. If you do feel like putting your name on your creation, use the menu for inspiration and veer off accordingly. I did so with my slightly overcooked yet still delicious elk burger, which provided a delicious combination of flavors that complemented a juicy, gamey patty.

We ended our meal on a sweet note with milkshakes to go. The salted caramel pretzel, with crunchy pretzel chunks for texture and a satisfying sweet-salty-toasty interplay, tasted the best of all the varieties we sampled. Burgatory also carries a respectable selection of craft brews and has an appealing cocktail program. All told, I won't hesitate to get stuck in Burgatory once more next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Tell me this picture doesn't make you want to run to Burgatory.

Bison pretzel bun gouda ... French fries 

Wagu beef with onion crust ... French fries

My guest had the almond torte shake ... made from Prantl's Bakery almond torte.

Parking is awful but it is worth the trip."}
{"text":"As a (primarily) vegetarian foodie, you have got to wonder why I would give a burger joint a 5 star rating. Four words - Their Burgers, Fries and Shakes. (Ok, so it was 5).

This place has the most delicious Vege (and Beef) burgers about. Period. Their truffle and gorgonzola fries are delicious. And their spiked shakes are just plain heavenly - my fave is the Old Grandaddy (Grandad's bourbon, Caramel, Vanilla icecream and copious amounts of whipped cream) - I've driven to Pittsburgh from Cleveland just for this place before!!!"}
{"text":"Two of my friends and I came here for dinner and a drink before going to the movies.  We got in line on NoWait.  NoWait is incredibly useful at this place, although if you have more than 7 people in your party it won't work.  The wait for our table was about 20 minutes which was worth the wait.

I always do the create-your-own burgers at places like this and it doesn't disappoint.  I haven't done any of the non-beef patties, but if they're anything like the beef ones they're going to be good.  This is my favorite burger place in Pittsburgh for a reason.

The milkshakes, including the spiked ones, are also pretty good.  I got the burned almond torte one.  It's not quite the same as the actual cake, but it's a passable substitute.  It's also spiked, so the amaretto helps make up for any deficit.

This is a great place to go if you're at the Waterfront.  It took our group about an hour and a half from arriving and checking in with the host to leaving.  That's atypical for this place.  It's always packed so I would make sure to use NoWait to keep that wait time reasonable."}
{"text":"Best burgers & shakes in Pittsburgh! This is my favorite place to eat in the Waterfront. I always order my shake first...the Burnt Almond Torte is my go to. Service is top notch-friendly & efficient."}
{"text":"Five stars for an amazing burger and service. I used the no wait app and we were able to finish our shopping while we were waiting for our table. We will  definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"When Burgatory first game out, it was a game changer. Organic food? Bison burgers? Elk burgers? Incredibly amazing shakes? 

First, let's look at the good: Only once have I not had an amazing meal there. You are also able to create your burger, which is something you don't normally see. With tons of options like the 50/50 burger (half ground meat, half bacon) and a crab burger, tons of spices and sauces to add, choices of buns, and tons of toppings to choose from, it's a winning situation for everyone. While you can't make reservations, the waiting time has gone down significantly in the past couple of years. There's an unfortunate reason for that one, though.

Now for the downside: Since of the opening of the restaurant, the prices have gone through the roof. Are you looking for a milkshake? That will be $6.50, please. No, seriously. For a milkshake. If you want a burger with cheese (because cheese is extra and some other toppings are, too) you're looking at a $13 - $17 price tag. Burgatory used to have these amazing chips; half Idaho potato and half sweet potato. The sweet potatoes are all but gone. Oh, and lest we forget, fries are extra. When all is said and done, if you and a date want a burger and shake, it's going to cost about $50, which is most likely why the line no longer goes out the door anymore."}
{"text":"The hostess wasn't super pleasant but our waitress and our food was amazing. We ordered the onion rings which were huge and crispy! All three of our burgers had amazing flavor they were just a little difficult to eat due to their massive size. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Best Impossible burger I have ever had! They even have vegan mayo to put in it! My non vegan friend had it and loved it too! Very cool place with a bunch a interesting burger toppings and rubs to choose from. Our server was extremely knowledgeable on which toppings and buns were vegan. Great place! We will be back, for sure!!"}
{"text":"We had an appetizer of fries covered in cheese, pot roast, & gravy (did not serve aspirin with it).  I had the chili. It has some kick - pretty good.

The elk & bison burgers were cooked as ordered.  My ceasar salad with grilled turkey was very good. 

The nutter butter milkshake was inhaled ... 

It was a good meal ... if you would like fish not on the menu ... nor daily soup.

We were looking for a fast turnover meal and it met our needs."}
{"text":"Recently had dinner there and ordered an appetizer \"Fork It\".  It was delicious.  Not knowing what curd cheese would taste like, but it complimented the sauce and pulled pork over the fries well.  
Bar staff are very courteous and quick.  Estimated wait time was 45-60 minutes, but was seated within 20-30 minutes.  Quick."}
{"text":"Had the Peanut Butter burger - was so good.  Went back again the next day and ate it again."}
{"text":"While the rest of the Northeast and eastern US is being infested with Burger Fi's (a chain that hasn't hit Pitt yet, but likely will soon) it seems Burgatory has taken over this region, which is a good thing. Meanwhile, keep in mind, this concept isn't new. Chains like The Counter and Unami Burger (and Burger Fi, among others) started this kinda experience more than a decade ago. 

It's nice to be able to now find a quality burger (in Western PA) that rivals the pricing at Five Guys (ok, maybe it's higher here), but blows away the quality and value. If you haven't been to this growing small chain yet - it's time for a visit. Burgatory is a must for those who like, yep, you guessed it: burgers. 

Visitors can design their own burger or choose from a specialty burger. Rather than just traditional hamburgers you can order an elk, buffalo, turkey, chicken, veggie and others, which helps allieve the monotony of always eating a regular hamburger. Personally, I prefer the custom meal where you can choose your meat, cheese, toppings and seasonings. They do a great job with all. 

One thing to keep in mind, however, is you are going to pay for quality. This isn't a cheap place to grab a quick meal. Instead, the burger alone will likely cost you $15, a small price to pay for the quality received. Add a side salad and a drink and you can expect $20 a person. (The side salad is top-notch greens, not crappy iceberg). Keep in mind, you get what you pay for. And, you won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Ive been to this location as well as the one in homestead and this one is my favorite. The burgers are delicious as are the milkshakes. 

My favorite milkshake is the burnt almond torte, which is good with or without the alcohol. I usually do the 'build your own' burger but i have gotten other items like the \"hot chick\" chicken sandwich before. 

For people who are trying to watch what they eat there are also healthier options like turkey burgers, chicken burgers, wheat buns or you can get no bun on your burger.

The only downside is that there more than likely will be a longwait time unless you go during early afternoon. 
I also wish they started a rewards membership for regular customers because they are a little pricey."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Had the Wagyu burger with pretzel bun and kona rub.  Fries were good as well."}
{"text":"Burger was so so, milkshake was a 10, the place is really nice, service was not the best, I will Def give it another shot and try a different burger."}
{"text":"I hate to say it,  but the burger disappointed me. It had all the fixibgs to taste amazing - haystack onions, blue cheese, arugula, brioche bun.... but the most flavorful thing was sadly, the arugula. I may give the place a 2nd try, especially because the alcoholic almond torte shake was phenomenal,  but I have never left a burger place disappointed before."}
{"text":"Second time at one of these! Amazing burger, great fries. Also the shakes are very taste with great presentation!
Clean restrooms, good parking, friendly service. Cups were never empty either, that's what makes a good meal."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and milkshakes. My favorite order is a create my own burger with either the hormone free beef or wagyu beef and then get a Burnt Almond Torte shake for dessert. Fries are an up charge but all burgers come with homemade chips that are great. It's a fun atmosphere and usually very busy inside."}
{"text":"I love burgers. I love that I can create my own burger at Burgatory.  There's a menu that you check off: bun, rub, sauce, cheese, toppings (some cost extra), meat type, doneness. There is usually a special, and this day is was a boring burger (cheddar, lettuce, tomato, garlic aoili) I often get a garlic aoili, +/- farmhouse cheddar, grilled pineapple and grilled jalapenos.  I ALWAYS get my burger well done.  Why? Because unless it's a cut of beef (steak, roast, etc), cooking the outside does not kill the bacteria that can make you ill. So, ground beef, as it sounds, needs to be cooked to a particular temperature to be safe to consume, hence the disclaimers on menus.  I don't play with meat--it get's cooked, but, every time I'm here I get an extremely dry burger that is charred on the outside.  The char is usually cleverly hidden by the toppings, but I can taste it.  And you can certainly get a good burger well done--not dried and burnt and tastes like the griddle/grill lubricant.  That's my beef with this place (pun intended).  I also wish they'd seed the jalapenos, as they are bitter (FACT: seeds do not cause the heat, capsaicin in the pith and vein does).  Otherwise, the burger has the potential to be awesome.  The fries are good, but the flavor from the herbs may not be present, depending on who is spicing your fries.  This last time, my water went unfilled, my burger burnt, my jalapenos bitter and my BBQ sauce nearly non-existent because it's sucked into the sponge of a bun.  I enjoy this place, but would much rather drive up to Burgh'ers in Zelienople or even head to Five Guys next door--as they are at least consistent and can give me a well done burger that doesn't taste like it's been sitting on a warmer for an hour. On a happy note, you're better off investing in a milkshake."}
{"text":"The carmal pretzal milkshake was will worth it. Morty's Steak Burger was excellent! Chips were a pleasant surprise, very good. 
Hostess and server were attentive. I would definitely recommend and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Pgh, hands down. I haven't had anything that isn't great, fries, shakes, corn bread, salad, chicken burger. You can't go wrong unless you put crazy stuff on your burger, then it's your fault."}
{"text":"I went to Burgatory and didn't eat a burger. What kind of American am I? Everything on the menu sounded so heavy so I settled with a chicken salad. The salad serving was huge and the waitress kept the water refills rollin'. 

If you live by the saying, \"A moment on the lips is forever on the hips\" I don't think Burgatory is your go to. All self proclaimed meat eating, deep fried, food bloggers step on up! 

There was an issue with my salad (the gross kind no one wants to discover when chompin' down on some greens) and my waitress quickly brought me out a new salad. The service is quick, the ordering process is different and fun. 

Good place to try out. The other bonus is the bathroom is dark and play loud music. No need to worry if your intestines start to blow smokes like a diesel truck. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  But, I just didn't enjoy it.  We went for a late lunch and the place was moderately busy but not overwhelmingly so.  Our server was very nice and she did a good job taking care of us.  The food was OK but not amazing - I've had a much better burger at Murray Avenue Grille or Dunning's in Regent Square.  In fact, the menu has three ways to prepare your burger:  Red, pink, or brown.  I ordered my burger red - the server told me that would ensure that the burger would be prepared medium rare.  Unfortunately, while my husband's burger was perfectly medium, so was my burger.  It did take a fair amount of time to receive our food so we didn't have time to wait for another properly prepared meal to arrive.  The manager came by and they comped my meal.  They did try to make it right.  But, for a place that is known for its burgers, to have it come to the table not cooked to order is inexcusable - especially at 2 o'clock on a Tuesday afternoon.  We did enjoy the truffle and Gorgonzola fries and I really loved the spicy baked beans.  If you like gin cocktails, try the Hendricks and mint lemonade which was tasty but a little overpriced at $7.50.  The atmosphere reminds me of a faux postindustrial urban warehouse and boy, is it LOUD.  In the bar area, there are TVs EVERYWHERE and the sound is on.  Even at the end of the lunch rush, the place was really loud.  That was another huge turnoff for us.  It's hard to keep a conversation going at 2 in the afternoon, I can't imagine what the place sounds like during the dinner rush on a Friday night.  No thanks!

Kudos to our server with the funky eyeshadow for taking such good care of us.  She was the high point of our experience.  Unfortunately, good service from one person doesn't entice me to return.  I don't think that we will be back."}
{"text":"Ate here prior to a concert.  Food and service excellent.  Will visit again. Had made to order bison and a mushroom sandwich. Both wonderful and juicy and best of all the tasty  bun held up."}
{"text":"amazing! this place has wonderful shakes and you can make your own burger! i had an amazing vegetarian friendly burger that was like an inner body experience. the waitress we had and the staff in general are very amicable. overall great experience will be coming back again :)"}
{"text":"Just had my first visit to Burgartory and was an immediate fan.

Restaurant looked clean, staff was friendly and the food was delicious. For an appetizer we ordered the gravy fries and cheese curd without braised pork. So good. For my entree I got their house veggie burger. The bun tasted fresh and really made for a great burger. Really good portions. Ordered my son a grilled cheese which I tried. The bread was buttery and grilled perfectly.

I shouldn't have, but I had to order the s'mores milkshake for dessert. It was super good. 

My only gripe, which isn't their fault was finding a decent parking space. The walk near the water and view of downtown Pittsburgh was a great end to the night as well. Very nice location.

Would recommend giving this place try."}
{"text":"Awesome food... I had an elk burger which was juicy and tasted amazing. The quinoa salad had melon, peppers, and cucumber--also wonderful. I'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"The burgers are *really* good.  The reason I've given them four rather than five stars, however, is that nearly every time I've gone they've gotten something wrong.  It's usually the temp of the burger - I like mine really rare - but it is also often the toppings, which is kind of a bummer when you build your own.  Regardless, even if to me it wasn't perfect, everything I've ordered there has been tasty.

(Pro tip: sure, the burgers are good but the chili is wonderful and the nachos are among the best I've ever had.  Get the nachos.)

The cocktails are really good (especially that grape/basil thing they have going), but the wine list is and has been terrible.  The beer selection is also good, and changes frequently.

As for the service, it's what you would expect from a hot spot.  The men are aloof and the women bitchy.  Ignore them.  Eat nachos."}
{"text":"Awesome! My husband and I took a weekend trip to Pittsburgh and stopped at Burgatory on the way out of town. It was by far both of our favorite meal of the trip. The atmosphere/decor had us rooting for the food to be good before we even saw a menu and everything went up from there. I built my own chicken sandwich (chicken breast instead of burger) with fries and my husband chose the potluck burger with chips. Both sandwiches were uniquely and incredibly delicious. So good it will have me wanting to drive the three hours to cinch the craving for a while. The chips were a very thick kettle cooked chip and they weren't bad, but weren't special. The fries were fresh and had almost a sweet seasoning on them which I found okay and my husband liked. Not that we had any room left for more, but we did get a choco taco shake to go (minus the alcohol)! Yummy. It was definitely pricey, but I feel like you could see and taste the quality of the up charge. Service was great as well! This is an \"upscale\" burger bar done right."}
{"text":"Ok, so I admit, I'm a burger snob. 

That's doesn't mean I will pass up a fast food burger if need be, nor will I scoff at a mid-range burger like a 5 Guys; but if you claim your product is on point and it's not, I'm calling your bluff.

This place makes no claims, and it doesn't need to...BURGATORY. IS. LE-GIT!

No joke, one of the top 5 burgers I've ever had. WHY do you ask? Maybe it's because I got to design it just the way I like it with a handy-dandy checklist that I penciled in and submitted to our waiter. Maybe it's the combo of fresh guacamole topping my burger on a soft, buttery pretzel bun. Maybe it was the thick cut potato chips that came with my burger, I JUST DON'T KNOW! It was so good I could overlook the fact that it wasn't coked mid-rare (which may have been my fault. The menu gives you 3 options for temp: red, pink, or cooked. I went with pink hoping it meant mid-rare, and it came out more mid to mid-well...WHATEVER, still delicious!).

Did I mention the milkshake? NO!? Milkshakes ALSO sick-good. Salted Carmel pretzel milkshake to be exact, and it was, like my burger, worthy of a G.O.A.T.-like ranking. No joke, I almost ordered a second.

Add good service, funky-fun decor, a loaded menu, and perfect location in between Heinz Field, PNC Park, and the North Shore subway station, it's a recipe for a winner. Sadly it's can only be found in the 412, so if you're driving through the Burgh, staying for a few days, or checking out a game, come here and message me and tell me how right I was."}
{"text":"Great name and Really amazing hormone free beef burgers, I like mine red and it came out that way but the cheese was slightly cool. I had the Meet the Maker burger and didn't change a thing, napa slaw and iced tea. Delicious flavor but the bun fell apart at the end so I fork and knifed it. Not a huge deal because it was scrumptious.
The place is a bit loud for dinner and we had a 45 minute wait. We are from out of town and visiting friends so we were committed to waiting. It wound up only being a 20 minute wait. 
Service was really friendly and hip waitrons with ink and personality, totally my kind of place. 
If we visit the area again we will surely make it back."}
{"text":"What can I say, this is a happy place for me. I know walking in, it's going to be about fun food. Whether it's the divine milkshakes, to the over the top burger of your making. This location is very busy, but I prefer it to the others because of the spaciousness. Their burgers are good. Not on the level of Butterjoint, but still good. Better than BRGR, in my opinion. They come with the house chips. Custom creation burgers are where it's at, and fun to create with their varied buns, sauces, rubs, and toppings. A hooked up burger may cost you a pretty penny though, heads up. Milkshakes are a must! they have spiked and non-spiked versions. The salted caramel is perfect if you don't want a sweet concoction. The burnt almond torte is a riff on the famous Prantl's bakery dessert. Have also tried the crab burger, it was delicious, but it's got minimal texture. I hear the veggie burger is fantastic and can't wait to try that sometime."}
{"text":"I'll make this short: best burger and milkshake I've had in Pittsburgh but use the NoWait app prior to going (it will save you a lot of time)"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in the Burgh!  This place is always packed and so glad they keep opening more locations. They do not take reservations but are on the NoWait app. We used this app on a Saturday night and were able to get seated right away once we arrived.  Our waiter had an attitude but oh well.  The shakes are amazing and reasonably priced.  I love the salted caramel pretzel-topped with whipped cream and caramel and mixed with vanilla ice cream and pretzel bites. I also recommend the Nutella crunch.  They also have a nice list of beers including many options for a draft or bottle.  We then started with the shredded pork nachos. They were spicy with jalapeños, guacamole, cheese and olives and more than enough to share amongst 4 people. . Next up were the burgers! I love the build your own with so many options.  They have a sheet that you mark with the type of burger (I go with the beef but also options for bison, chicken, veggie-which is really good for a veggie burger), then pick the bun and I enjoy the whole wheat option.  You then pick a rub for your burger-I went with the sweet onion this time.  Cheese is an extra dollar but they have lots of unique options. I choose the buffalo cheddar. Out of the veggie toppings you get to pick 4.  You can also add on almost anything from bacon to avocado for a small extra charge.  Then pick the sauce-I went the mustard-nothing too exciting. They burgers come with chips and for a small fee you can upgrade to other sides such a salad or fries. Write your name on the sheet, pick how you would like the burger done and turn it in.  The burgers come out cooked exactly how you like marked with your name in a pitchfork marker in the burger!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good burger in the area after landing in Pittsburgh. Of course yelp led me to burgatory and it didn't disappoint. They had so many burger options that I couldn't decide so I went with making my own burger. Everyone else in my group also went with making their own burger.
I went with a custom bison burger that came out pretty good. I asked for the bison to be cooked medium and it was over cooked. The rosemary olive oil bun I ordered was dry and regretted that decision. Other than those everything else came out great and their fries were pretty good too."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place.  I went in Dec. 2012 and thought the food was out of this world.  I had a delicious snickerdoodle milkshake, and steak style burger, and fries, and split the onion rings with my boyfriend.  This was also in the afternoon.

I went back with my boyfriend this past weekend on a Sat. night.  Mistake.  We were told it would be a two hour wait.  We were really looking forward to eating here again, and it was a bit of a drive, so we browsed some stores to kill the time.  

Two hours later we were seated in the heated patio area, which was cold despite the heat lamps.  Our waitress was pushy, not giving us enough time to order.  Nor did she refill our water glasses until I asked at the end.  

Not the best experience.  If you go, go at an off time.  Otherwise, there are other burger places in central Pitt, with equivalent food and probably better service."}
{"text":"Wow.  I didn't think I would find such a great burger joint in Pittsburgh on my first try, but this place may end up being my favorite for the Burgh.

To start, I love the ambiance of this place.  I was skeptical parking in the strip mall, but the low lighting, dark atmosphere, and chic decorations transport you away to...well, Burgatory.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful in explaining some of the different options on the menu.  He didn't seem to mind at all that we were taking our time.

We started off with the Gorgonzola fries, which were awesome even without the yummy cheese.  They had the perfect crispiness if you ask me.  The Gorgonzola was delicious and complimented the fries well.  They were careful in making the dish not to put too much of the strong cheese over the fries.  Nicely balanced Burgatory (+1).

I ended up getting the \"Meat your Maker\" medium rare as per my waiter's recommendation.  Let me tell you, he was right.  This thing was awesome.  At first, I was a little disappointed--expecting the greasy goodness that I sometimes demand from my burger--but this one was different.  This one was...divinely refined.  All of the subtle flavors started to come to together and sing in sweet burger harmony.  The dry aged wagyu beef started the chorus with its sweet onion crust playing the harmony.  The beef alone had amazing flavor and texture.  It wasn't before long that the roasted tomatoes and Gruyere joined in the delicious melody.  Then, out of no where, the truffled shallot aioli burst on to my taste buds to steal the show.  It's like a choir of angelic burger fairies were dancing and singing on my tongue. 

 Ah yes, Burgatory, you have raised my bar on what I can expect out of a delicious, refined, perfectly conceptualized burger... I shall return.  Perhaps to raise my bar a bit higher ;-)"}
{"text":"I stayed at Pittsburgh for 5 days, and one of my most memorable experiences was eating at Burgatory. When you look at the menu, you must start off with the shakes, and I will guarantee that you'll have a hard time deciding which one to get. They also have hard shakes with amazing descriptions, but sadly I am under 21 :( It didn't really matter because the salted nutella crunch (nutella with nestle crunch bars) was ridiculously addicting and I could have been happy at the restaurant just eating the shake.

However, this place is a burger joint so we obviously have to mention those too. You can either choose a burger from the menu or you can make your own by marking off on a paper menu the kind of meat, bun, rub, cheese, sauce, and toppings you want for your burger. You should try the truffled shallot aioli sauce and add avocados to your burger if you like them! The burgers were juicy and the beef was a perfect medium rare. Because there are so many toppings, they are stabilized with a mini pitchfork, which is so suitable because my whole meal was just really sinful. The burgers come with regular and sweet potato chips on the side but trust me and order the truffled gorgonzola fries to eat with your burger. 

We didn't get our burgers for a long time, but my boyfriend and I didn't really notice since we were talking the whole time and were distracted by how good the shake was. It must have been over 45 minutes though, and the manager came out to apologize and reassure us that the burgers were coming right away. When we got our check, the prices of the burgers were subtracted from the total so we basically got them for free. I was floored by the manager's gesture and the great customer service.

I will definitely hit up Burgatory again when I return to Pittsburgh and get the chance to go."}
{"text":"A busy, engaging and fun atmosphere that worked for our group of adults and little ones. Don't miss the adult shakes. We shared a seasonal pumpkin shake and a chocolate shake (forgot the name), both were excellent. Our server Jessica was super helpful and attentive. There was also a full range of college football on the multiple TVs. I had a crab cake burger with sriracha sauce. Very good with the right amount of crab and heat. My wife had a burger that she really liked. Another local chain with good food, atmosphere and service. We'll go again."}
{"text":"Pro's:
- If there is a line, you can put yourself on the list over the internet. It saves a few minutes.

Con's:
- No waiting area at all, minus a bench on the outside, which is useless since it's not covered and it's currently winter. You feel like a cow on the way to the slaughterhouse with the way people are packed in at the restaurant. You also have to try to avoid the doors and running into people eating.
- It's always packed and I couldn't imagine going there on a Friday or Saturday.
- No yellow American cheese. Their version of American cheese is not as good.
- They have a habit of burning burgers bad. They went 2 for 2 in my 2 visits in burning them.
- They make you fill out a sheet stating what you want for your burger. It takes too long to fill it out and then they screw it up anyway because no one can understand it. Writing down what you want is the waitress' job, not the customer's.
- Want fries with your burger? You're paying extra. 
- The service is slow and you might as well be playing \"Where's Waldo?\" when its time to find your waitress.
- Everyone who works there looks really weird. Tattoos, piercings, hair dye, strange attires, the works.


Overall thoughts:
Not sure how this place got the best burger in Pittsburgh, but obviously, they paid someone off. It's okay but not on the level of Red Robin or some other great burger places here. This place is an expensive, hippie filled mess and they need to get their act together if they want to grow. The number one thing they need to work on is the waiting area, as you are either packed and trying not to run into people or you're gonna be sitting in the cold outside."}
{"text":"The epic Burgatory Review you've waited for...

\"Go to Burgatory!\"
\"Burgatory is awesome!\"
\"Burgatory has delicious burgers!\"

I went to Burgatory with 3 other people excited to eat!  I didn't have a shred of doubt this would be one of the best burgers and dining experiences I ever had and I can honestly say after last night I'd rather be trapped in real purgatory than ever be put through the hell this place put me through.

Usually, if you look over my reviews out of about 100 or so I have 3 bad ones and they are mostly for fast food places.  You would think this was a run down McDonald's by the service and quality we received.  This is going to be a lengthy review so strap on, they deserve it.

We went there about 8:30, the waitress informed me they stop taking orders at 10:00 so we had plenty of time to have a few beers and talk about our days with each but NOPE, not with this waitress. \"You ready to order, hey you ready to order, ready to order, you guys ready (eyes rolling in her head) you ready to order, ready to order, (huffing) you ready to order, ready to order guys\" and that was all in 10 minutes of us being there.  Finally we decided let's just tell this girl to bring us an appetizer and a beer so she would just let us be for a second.  We even told her it was our first time, she didn't make and recommendations and really seemed like nobody trained her on how to be a server she just said \"I hope you guys don't hate me\"!  No knowledge of the menu, no flow, no charisma no anything you need to be a server.  We ordered nachos.

Lord if this was a sign to get out of there I'm sorry I didn't listen.

These nachos were AAWFUL!!   Soggy chips, globbed on toppings and for real, 5 shredded pieces of lettuce, 5!!!!  All this dish was, was HOT (spicy).  No flavor, no balance in toppings, no love!  When it was over the table agreed these were vomit inducing nachos.  

Well ok, our server was bad, our nachos were awful but this is a burger place so they gotta get burgers right, right!?

WRONG!!!

I ordered the most expensive burger they had, a$14.00 supposed Wagyu beef burger.  Don't worry there's a photo on this review of what's suppose to be a prime beef perfectly cooked burger.  They sent me a shriveled burnt piece of shit on a wet soggy bun with equally awful quality toppings!  I brought it AND the nachos to our waitress attention and what did we get? Drumroll for the eye rolls please!  Our whole table was in awe at how awful of a server she was and the ATTITUDE!!  Wow!!   She says to me would you like some fries while you wait for us to remake your burger, I agreed.  I didn't realize you were making me eat the fries that came with the burger!  When they brought me my burger there was no fries with that also, just the burger as if they were penalizing me for sending it back!!  

And guess what?

This burger was worse than the first one they brought out!!!  It looked like someone sat on it!  I don't manage restraunts but even Stevie Wonder could see that McDonalds made better Big Macs than this supposed WAGYU GOURMET BURGER.

And the waitress had the nerve to make it seem like they couldn't please me and I was picky!  No, this was shit! A SHIT experience and a SHIT burger.  It physically  looked like cow shit, not cow beef.

At this point I'm fumin!  From the pushy, unknowledgable waitress, attitude driven, unskilled waitress to the sloppy nachos and now this abomination of a burger!!  The last saving grace is the manager, I mean, THEY CAN MAKE IT RIGHT, RIGHT!!???

WRROOOONG!!??

Holy shit this guy had so much attitude!  He had the nerve to say I'm a tough customer to please!  And took half off my NACHOS for the dissatisfaction, what-a-JOKE.  I still paid half my bill of a meal I technically didn't even eat!  Oh, I ate the fries hahahahahahaha.  Rather than just comp my meal, to insult me more he gives me a free shake card hahahahahahahahahahaha I will NEVER be back here for a shake EVER!  Not once did he say \"I'm sorry for your dissatisfaction\" every angle was him either sticking up for how it's prepared or questioning ME!!!

Soggy burnt meal low quality meal
Terrible cooks
Terrible server with an attitude 
Terrible management with an attitude 
No resolve to my problem
Filthy restaurant 
Awful lighting and decor 
Unpleasing and unwelcoming all together

I've had much much much better experiences across the road at Red Robin for half the price.  

This will go down for me as one of the worst dining experiences I've had not only in/around Pittsburgh but one the worst experience I've had anywhere my entire life!

That was the first and last time I go there or ever speak a word of their establishment.  

Save your money and go to Red Robin, or McDonalds."}
{"text":"It is an okay place to grab a bite and drinks with friends. The burgers are usually good with succulent juicy patty. I didn't like their fries since they are usually more salty and less crispy. The beer selection is good and they do have some liquor and wines as well but not a whole lot. The usual stuff on tap. All in all, nothing too fancy and you can check it out if you're around the area but don't expect much from an average American chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Great burgers and milkshakes!  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Sunday evening (~545 PM), pretty busy, trying this for the first time kind-of-a-night in a 'new to me' town, I tried this 'must-do' joint with some guarded enthusiasm.  I am, after all, enthusiastic but skeptical.  

That said, the bar was my landing zone.  After a great intro by the bartenders, I ordered a Jamison neat and a Farmer Brown, medium, w/fries.  

The order took about 15-20 mins to arrive and was missing the ham and egg (fried).  When alerted to the fact, the bartender promptly complained to the kitchen.  The same burger was returned w/a HARD fried egg and ham (rather than the runny yolk promised).  

While quite tasty, the burger was a hot mess.  After having left the kitchen so much later than he ingredients were put together really killed the experience.  The bartenders who sold me the Farmer Brown so diligently were obviously nearly as disappointed as I, but neither one offered anything in terms of a chat to discuss the kitchen's misfire.

The bartenders were helpful and attentive, up until the adversity of two shoddy outputs were delivered.

I'll give it a second try, but will take a little while to return."}
{"text":"Burger was nasty and didn't like the loud music it is a place I will never will go to again"}
{"text":"Had the Bourbon BBQ wings for an App and they were delicious. Perfectly fried & I really liked the sauce.

I built my own burger. I got the Aged Wagyu on Biroche with White American Cheese and the Angel Dust Rub. It was very good my only complaint would be I selected pink but my burger was well done. Still it had an excellent taste.

For dessert I had the Salted Nutella Crunch Shake. It was amazing. I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Good burger, awesome shakes! Would definitely recommend for a night out with family, just not great for kids 5 and under. Loud, my three year old was saying it was way too loud. Otherwise a good experience."}
{"text":"Gourmet burger joints just scream 'Murica in my mind.  I had an elk burger and it was a party in my mouth!  The beer selection is great and the fact that almost every server was easy on the eyes didn't hurt either.  Apparently this is a local chain in the Pittsburgh area.  Id go back without a second thought."}
{"text":"Very happening restaurant.  The food was good. I really liked their special sauce it was like a mix of ketchup , mayo, and BBQ sauce.  The bonus of the meal is they have fresh squeezed lemon aid."}
{"text":"I was skeptical but the fellas really wanted to give this place a go seeing that We have heard many great things from the locals about it. I'm not much of a burger guy but I was extremely happy to see the bison burger on the menu! The burger was amazing to say the less. I will for sure be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times and they are usually pretty speedy in getting your party seated.  In terms of gluten free, they do have a special menu with a slew of options from rubs, to meats, to toppings and even shakes.  Happily they also offer gluten free buns.  Usually I find myself building myself a custom burger.  For example the bison burger with the sweet onion rub, buffalo cheddar cheese, guacamole , romaine, cucumber, and sliced tomato on a gluten free bun with napa slaw.  Last time, i paired this with a root beer float.  It was pretty amazing.  
The place itself is pretty cool with a bit of a modern feel.  Plenty of parking available, though it might involve a small walk :D"}
{"text":"Excellent choices. You can create your own. Even with no bun! Personally I move that. Great service.  Most of the waitresses have a sense of humor. I even tried the veggie burger with bacon added on. Delicious. 
Once I had to wait for 15 minutes or so, but the wait was worth it. Some of my friends thought it was pricey, but I think it is value for money. This is not a fast food joint. This was my second visit and will be back again."}
{"text":"This is one amazing joint. From the wide selections of burgers to the craft beer on tap.  They have a large selection of tv's as well with all different sporting events on. 

We went there with a larger party that includes 3 children under 3 including an infant. They were very accommodating to us. Had some Railbender beer from Erie brewing co. Plus they have a wide variety of craft beer on tap. 

My wife had one of their specialty burgers that had peanut butter and habanero jelly on it. It was out of this world. I had a burger with ham and a fried egg which was amazing. My daughter had the kids mini burgers which were a nice size. Their French fries have some type of seasoning on them which is different than I have ever had. 

When I am back in the burg I will definitely be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"This place actually rules. When I moved to Pittsburgh in August, locals were very eager to throw their suggestions at me as far as what I needed to experience. Burgatory was a recurring theme that I was quick to investigate. Yes, you're going to wait half a day to get in, but set aside some time and check it out. The atmosphere is great for going out with friends or family and getting chatty. The waitstaff is incredibly competent, and always willing to offer input and suggestions. The drinks are pricey, so I usually pass.

Now to the good stuff. The food is awesome. Every appetizer I've had the pleasure of trying has been flavorful and well put together, the fries are consistently excellent, and the milkshakes are the bomb.com. But, of course, it is the succulent little beauties composed of beef and heaven that keep me going back. Each Burgatory burger is made with love, and topped with the finest ingredients known to man. I love them. So much. My suggestion is a Waygu beef patty on Brioche with egg, Cheddar cheese and mushrooms."}
{"text":"Way too much cream, and not enough ice-cream in the shakes; like literally the top half of the cup is just cream.

It's weird that the burgers come with chips instead of fries.  Fries would be much better.

Good burger though.  And the people working there are always friendly.  Just a little over priced."}
{"text":"This just opened location is right across the street from the movie theater. There have been so many different restaurants in this space I can't keep track of them all. 

The space is rather small compared to the previous restaurant that occupied the same space. I'm not sure why Burgatory didn't take more space as the storefront next door is available for lease and was a part of the last restaurant that was there. They need all the square footage they can get. 

I still don't get why Burgatory doesn't take reservations so be prepared to wait 1 hour plus on the weekends now that the weather is nice. One really cool new feature they do have is that once you are put into the que of people waiting you can go to the No Wait App and see how many people are ahead of you and when it is time to walk back over to the restaurant.

The wife and I started off with our usual Berry Lemonades and our daughter had a Natrona Vanilla Cream Soda.

For an appetizer we got the Just Fork It (Fresh cut fries smothered with Braised Short Ribs, Cheddar Cheese Curds & Pan Gravy) They were EPIC and worth the wait themselves! 

Next my daughter and I both got the Standard Deluxe Burger. It's a burger with White American Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion and their House Burger Sauce. I added bacon and sauteed mushrooms to mine. It was huge and outstanding! The wife got the Hot Chick sandwich. (Grilled Herbed Chicken, Sharp Provolone, Tomatoes, House-Made Guacamole, Chipotle Sour Cream & Cilantro Leaves on Grilled Herbed Focaccia. Served with lightly dressed Field Greens.)

Our waitress Jordan was great as well and took really good care of us. I think the Waterfront finally has a winner that will last in this once doomed space."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! Oh my goodness! These burgers are delicious! 

I absolutely love burgers! My wife heard about this place and decided to take me here. I love her! We went on a Friday night and the place was packed! We had a 25 minute wait but it went by quick. (thank God for Angry Birds!) So the hostess came and took us to our booth. FYI walk slowly or you will bust your ass. Their floor is extremely slippery. I don't know if there's grease on the floor or what. 

We looked over the menu and started off with the Berry Lemonade and the Bourbon BBQ Sriracha Wings. They were both delicious! Next we both had the Standard Deluxe Burger. It's a burger with White American Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion and their House Burger Sauce. It was huge and outstanding! The homemade potato chips are really good also.

Burgatory is my new favorite burger place!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service with unbelievable burgers. Highly reccomend the create your own option."}
{"text":"Since I was visiting downtown Pittsburgh for a conference, I decided to explore the area and stumbled upon Burgatory for lunch. I wanted to see Heinz Field and Burgatory was on the same street about a minute's walk away so it was perfect. The restaurant wasn't too busy so everything was smooth sailing. The service was spot on too. My waitress was really nice and attentive.

I ordered from their weekday lunch menu and got the crispy chicken sandwich ($8.50). It was delicious. The sandwich was hot and fresh and packed with this tangy slaw that worked really well with the fried chicken. Might be too tangy for some people, especially since they put pickles in the sandwich too, but I liked it since it provided a nice balance to the fried chicken. The sandwich also came with a side of chips, which weren't bad but I prefer fries. The chips were also slightly overseasoned so they were a bit salty for my taste, but minor things to be honest. Overall, it was a great dining experience. I would definitely eat at Burgatory again if I'm ever in Pittsburgh in the future!"}
{"text":"The manager here was AWESOME! We attempted to make a reservation or do call ahead because of our large party, but Burgatory does neither. However, the manager really worked to get us at our table earlier than the expected wait time. The staff immediately came out with waters as soon as we were seated. And as expected, our food and drinks were nothing short of amazing!"}
{"text":"I have no complaints for this place! I can't wait to go back during warmer weather so that I can sit outside. I usually build the same burger and it's delicious every single time. The milkshakes are great too if you can stomach that and your meal. The caramel pretzel is good choice if you're looking for a shake with the right amount of salty and sweet."}
{"text":"Lunch with two little kiddos. 11:45, Saturday. Outstanding service. Quick if you get there right before lunch."}
{"text":"really good burger, lots of choices.  the appetizers were delicious (fried ribs, fork it up, wings), but the fries that came with my entree were cold, which was a bit disappointing.  

the rubs were creative, but there wasn't enough information about the ones with non-descriptive names on the menu.  our server was lovely, but it was extremely busy and just reading it would have been easier than asking her 1000 questions.  

the meal was very enjoyable, but it would have been nice to have more space.  the tables are quite small, but I can't imagine they can use larger ones.  very popular place! I definitely recommend trying it, but getting it to go, if possible"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had! I also loved the corn bread with honey butter. Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Good service. Good nachos. Good burgers. Amazing shakes. Great environment. Great place."}
{"text":"Food took forever and really wasn't anything special. Buns were gummy on the burgers and I wasn't impressed with even my custom burger. We felt very rushed because it was busy, but this restaurant didn't stand out as anything special honestly, not much higher than a bigger fast food burger."}
{"text":"A few friends and I went there for some drinks and appetizers before a night out on the town and were slightly disappointed. The nachos were soggy and had too many toppings to chip ratio, which ended in us not being able to even eat them. The jalapeño bacon fries were OK. Not as described on menu, had whole jalapeños just tossed with some fries. I will say that the pork belly tacos were outstanding. 3 street tacos with cilantro, grilled pineapple, and pickled red onion. Overall slightly disappointed because we heard great things, but also can't be too upset because we didn't even try the burgers - what they are known for. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for apps and drinks."}
{"text":"My wife and I are visiting from out of town and came across this place while searching for a place to eat and we were not disappointed. The service was friendly and quick and the food was even better. The poutine was especially delicious, so much so that's all my wife had for her meal! I had one of the burgers, cooked perfectly and simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Best burger hands down .....you get to make your own burger set to your specifications...doesn't take that long to get food to the table and the wait staff is really friendly. Will be going back for more. Highly highly recommended"}
{"text":"If the situation presented itself, I would sell my first-born for a caramel pretzel shake."}
{"text":"Oh my jesus is this place the bomb. Best burger I have ever had so far in my 32 years of life on this planet. You very seriously cannot go wrong in any burger you choose. Oh, and get the blue cheese fries because WOAH. I could just eat those little bad boys forever. They were so good even the kids liked them (this is a huge deal, you guys). We were so uncomfortabley full after our delicious, mouth-watering, delectable burgers, fries and chips - but, we were on vacation - so of course this didn't stop us from ordering shakes. Salted Caramel Pretzel shakes for the kids and I forget the exact name but some sort of hard shake with apples and bacon goodness for the man-friend and I. I was on the verge of explosion after this evening of pure, unadulterated gluttony and boy was it worth it. I HIGHLY recommend dining at this local chain, and if you live close, coming on a regular basis! So so so amazingly good. I wish we lived closer!"}
{"text":"Well, that was good.....had the steakhouse burger. But I had without a bun so I could save my intake for a nice strawberry shake afterwords

The burger was juicy and tasted fantastic. The fries were also really good and perfectly cooked. I'll definitely be back to this one. Keep on yelping all....."}
{"text":"Beware..Visited here on a Monday writing this on Thursday  ..I will never go to this location ever again and I'm not sure if I will visit any other ones ever.. My first experience 2years ago was bad and I decided to give it another try. My boyfriend and I were having a rough week after the loss of our best friend. After a very emotional day we didn't want to cook. Our server was sam, who didn't seem to happy to be there.. We filled out the create your own slips have them to her and then He ordered a chocotaco milkshake to start I wasn't given the chance to order one because she took the menu and walked away. Milkshake got dropped off a little while later but no chance to order one.. Our food came and it looked great. I had the veggie option with smoked Gouda garlic mayo lettus tomato grilled onions and pickles. I may have forgotten to mark pickles but wanted them so I waved the girl down and asked if I could get some.. She rolled her eyes  and we never saw her again till we wanted our checks.. The pickles were dropped off by someone else which I was just happy to get them.. Our food was very good. When she brought our checks she then asked you didn't want a milkshake right?...  I said no.. Because at that point I was ready to pay and leave.. Like I said the food was good but the attitude atmosphere was terrible..  She never came back to see if our food tastes good or if we needed anything else.. I guess if you want the food maybe order take out.. I waited a few days to write the review knowing that I had a rough day.. But there's no change..I didn't make her go to work that day but I didn't go out for dinner to go home feeling like this.."}
{"text":"This location is rather small, but the food is always delicious! And service was great too! Don't be afraid to mix those rubs either"}
{"text":"Overpriced letdown.  The vegan burger was mushy.  3 burgers and 2 shakes was over $50."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have ever had. The build your own burger is the way to go. I am on a low carb diet and they have plenty of options for that and still have great taste. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The absolute best burger I have ever eaten in my life.  It was a Morton's steak house burger, perfectly cooked.  It was better than any steak dinner I have eaten.  We sat at the bar cause it was busy and we couldn't of been taken care of better by Pam the bartender.  It's pricey but worth it.  Can't wait to try a milkshake.  My all time favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Milkshakes are incredible! I love the chocolate pretzel the best. Burgers aren't anything to write home about, especially for the price. The service was terrible...young girl with no personality who needs to change professions. I love giving great reviews, and as much as I'd cut off 3 toes for an endless supply of the milkshakes, I can't give more than 3 stars because the overpriced burgers aren't that good and the service was below average."}
{"text":"In the words of another reviewer, Burgatory is an ass whooping of a taste no matter what you get. The ability to create your own burger is awesome, with the endless possibilities of sauces and toppings. Their milkshakes are to die for, some with alcohol in them. 

Their staff is extremely friendly and down to earth. I love doing takeout when I don't feel like going out to wait. I recommend getting the no wait app so you don't have to wait for hours outside"}
{"text":"We decided to head over to the north shore today to check out Burgatory. We left work around 11:15 to beat the rush.  

Our waitress was friendly, but not super engaging. I ordered a Medium Buffalo burger with smoked Gouda cheese, the Diablo rub, onions, pickles, jalapeños, and organic field greens. My burger was cooked perfectly. Not rare, but also not well done. The perfect medium, but a bit more on the rare side. I also got the bourbon BBQ sauce on the side. It was really good! I don't usually order BBQ because I'm more of a spicy person. The Diablo rub made up for the lack of hot sauce. It had a kick to it! Loved it. 

The burger came with chips on the side. You could have subbed them for a different side for a small cost. I elected to stay with the chips. I wish they had a seasoning on them though. I added some salt and pepper, but they were still missing something. 

Overall, I really liked my burger and would definitely come back again :)"}
{"text":"The Meat Your Maker burger is the only burger you should ever get, cooked medium. You won't regret it. Or at least as long as you don't think about how many calories you're consuming. But even then, it's still worth it."}
{"text":"Nope. Neat place, but food and service not worth the wait. We were here just this afternoon. 

The first thing I noticed when we were seated was that the chair was possibly the most uncomfortable thing I'd ever sat in. I highly recommend requesting a booth if you go. *If* we ever go back (and it would only be because my 11-year old really liked his crab burger) I will request a booth. No more slippery metal chairs for me.

Although I like the atmosphere, it was loud and everything echoed. I couldn't hear a thing our server was telling us. We kind of managed to piece things together and three of the four of us ordered custom creation burgers... mine was just plain, classic. I ordered a plain burger (which is something out of the ordinary... they typically season all the patties) with lettuce, pickles, mayo, cooked what they call \"pink,\" which I interpreted as \"medium,\" since there are only three choices on the creation sheet (red, pink, or no pink). I received a burger that practically mooed at me and the toppings were wrong (they did correct the toppings). My husband ordered \"pink\" as well, and received something that looked med-well. When we asked the server about it, she said mine was more reflective of what their \"pink\" should be, and the manager later told us my husband's actually was overcooked.

We did actually specify when asked by the server that it was our first time at the restaurant. The indicators of degree to which the burgers are cooked should have been explained. 

Not that I could have heard her.

While I didn't enjoy my meal, my husband thought his was decent. One of my sons ordered a crab burger with guacamole and he loved it. My other son ordered The Hot Chick and also really liked it.

The manager did come out to see us when I sent the burger back and he removed the charge from our bill, which I appreciated. However, the poor service combined with the discomfort of not being able to hear my family and sliding off my chair will prevent me from going back."}
{"text":"So many great places to choose while in downtown Pittsburgh - but you need to try this one!

We went in around lunch time and the place was clean and not too busy.  I ordered the Korean Tacos, Deep Fried Ribs, a salad, 3 tequila shots and a beer.  It was a good meal for me. 

My husband ordered a custom burger and a giant banana shake.  It was so big he had a hard time finishing it.

The staff was super friendly and they have sayings on the walls that support Pittsburgh Sports teams - so that was a plus!

Service - AWESOME!!
Food - FANTASTIC!!!
Overall experience - Delightfully Superb!!!

Don't miss out on this one of a kind restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! We were asked by 4 different people if we needed help as soon as we walked in. Such friendly and accommodating staff. The beer and sports bar is great! Such a pleasant and personal experience."}
{"text":"So we went there Saturday night to have some burgers and watch the Pens game. Me and my roommate ordered burger. I ordered mortys steakhouse, he got standard deluxe. It wasnt good at all. First we felt fine but we threw up all night and had a stomachache, both of us. It was such a bad night. This is my third experience eating burgatory. And all of them was different location.  Burgers are ridiculously bad here.. plus it makes me sick eating here...."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic dinner at Burgatory!  Great and friendly staff. I had the Morty's Steakhouse burger cooked pink. It was juicy and perfectly cooked. The flavor combination of onion straws and wine sauce was amazing. We also enjoyed the caramel pretzel, s'mores, and salty Nutella crunch milk shakes. I would highly recommend Burgatory to anyone looking for a great burger!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, seem subfriendly service. Unfortunately the condiments are not really noted that they are an aditional fee $1 each for tomatoes onions peppers etc. The menu gives you the impression any toppings that are not marked is possible they are free...Beware I ordered Bison $12 regular toppings that are usually free on a sandwich in DMV they charge for here.. Manager was not customer friendly and basically told me Anywhere else you would need to pay for condiments  .. Rule of thumb its best for waitresses or waiters to be courteous and tell if there is additional pricing for items, and not go back and forth if with a customer. But np, 1st visit last visit. Food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Omg YUMMMM ! I put my name on the waitlist through yelp which is AWESOME !! So we only waited for like 10 min for a table. It was packed and supposedly it's always like that but it's so worth the wait! We got the \"fork it\" appetizer and burgers of course! 
The appetizer was outstanding seriously get it ! The meat was so moist and flavorful the cheese curds were powerful and the fries were crisp I highly recommend this appetizer it was the perfect size for sharing (3ppl all together in my party)  
I built my own burger. I got the beef burger on brioche with cracked peppercorn rub, smoked Gouda, roasted garlic mayo, bacon, onion straws, pickles, and arugula!  Omg my burger was cooked perfect and idk how to describe it but the beef was so flavorful I really almost didn't  need any toppings the beef burger alone was so good. 

I highly recommend this place the food is awesome and MOST importantly the service was fantastic our servers name was Diesel and she was very friendly answered all of our questions and really made our first experience awesome! 
If I could give 6 stars I would !!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice while visiting friends and both trips were delightful. The first time I went was for dinner, and I had their Fork It appetizer (fries smothered in braised short ribs and gravy with cheese curds--aka poutine).  It was delicious, but incredibly rich, and it got mushy and soupy the more I dug into the dish.  The Dogfish Head Indian brown ale that I got to drink was a good choice (they have a small but excellent selection of craft beers).

The second time I went was during a busy lunch hour.  I had a build-your-own burger with provolone, avocado, caramelized onion jam, and bacon.  Tasty, but very messy.  The onion jam was to die for.  I also got their special shake of the day--vanilla ice cream, vanilla pudding, and Oreos.  Like dirt pudding in milkshake form; it was even topped with a gummy worm.  Delicious!

Both times I went my server was personable, fun, and knowledgeable.  I like the decor and atmosphere a lot, though I also agree with some reviewers about it being noisy and crowded.  The first time I went was later at night so it was a little less busy, but during lunch time on my second trip it was a zoo.  I'd recommend going before or after peak meal hours."}
{"text":"Decent burger and food, but the service was terribly slow. We waited for more than 40mins and didn't get any of our food. Nearly missed the movie and left with hunger. If you're about to watch a movie in an hour, this is not where you wanna be."}
{"text":"Build your own sandwich option is costly but worth it. Bartender was very helpful since it was our first time there and not familiar with the menu, he took time to explain what the options were and explain the sauces/seasonings"}
{"text":"I have been to the Waterworks Burgatory as well as the spot at Consol Arena and the food truck at Mario's Livingroom. I have enjoyed their burgers and shakes many times. So, when they opened in the Waterfront, I was very excited. As a Waterfront \"local\", I waited for a while before venturing over there. New restaurant openings there always attract a huge crowd. Today, my husband and I went there for lunch at noon. It was busy but the wait was only 10 minutes. I gave my cell number to the hostess and even though I got a text to see the hostess because my table was ready, it wasn't ready when I went inside. We had to wait for them to clear and wipe the table before being seated. My brother had recommended the Espresso Love shake. I've had their hard shakes before, so I ordered that shake and so did my husband. The tequila in the shakes were overpowering. Never before have I had a Burgatory hard shake where the alcohol was so overwhelming. Even the man at the table next to us made mention of the same thing. The waitress who took our order was very nice, but one guy brought us our shakes and a completely different guy brought us our meals. I hope they tip share because other than taking our order and taking away our empty plates and things, she did little else. The special burger of today was a chorizo burger with pulled pork on top. My husband ordered that and said it was the dryest thing he had ever tasted. He made comparisons to the Sahara and the Gobi when describing this  burger. I did a Create your Own burger. I ordered a beef  burger with provolone, mushrooms, pickles and a sweet onion rub on the beef. I have to cut most all sandwiches in half and when I cut this in half, it just oozed greasy. The bottom of the wheat bun was saturated with greasy juices. Also, their assembly of the burger goes against all conventional thinking which, in this case, was NOT a good thing. They put the cold pickles against the hot provolone cheese, then the lettuce and then put the sauteed mushrooms on top of the lettuce so they fell out all over the place. Whoever cleared this burger to be served was NOT paying attention or doesn't know what they are looking at as my mushrooms were all over the basket before I even laid eyes on my burger. The sea salt and herb fries needs to drop the herbs. They don't suit the fries and they don't suit beef. The flavors clash. I had to use a lot of ketchup to cover the herb flavor. I might come back here if i'm just going to have a short bite, but not for a full meal. I was sadly disappointed with Burgatory after all my great previous experiences with them. I know they will get my business when I go to a Pens game."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend in Pittsburgh this past weekend and I really wanted to go someplace local. I was open to go to anyone of her favorite spots and we ended up here. The location was great. Walking distance from the huge \"Mr. Rogers\" statue and near the football stadium. 

Seeng how this place is known for its burgers and shakes, I automatically thought of Shake Shack being from New York. This place however is like Shake Shack for the big kids. For starters I ordered a spiked milkshake,  the burnt almond. It was by far the best milkshake I have ever had!!! I honestly could have left this place without ordered another thing and still would have been happy. For starters we ordered onion rings and wings. The wings were absolutely delicious, but the onion rings Icould have gone without. I ordered the Buffalo cheddar burger and my friends chose to create their own burgers. That option was pretty cool, they have a notepad with all the burger options and then just check off what they wanted.  With every burger you have to choose pink or no pink. I personally prefer to get my burgers medium well, but nothing less the burger was still very good. When I come back to Pittsburgh I will definitely make another visit to Burgatory"}
{"text":"Been to two different locations, never disappoints. If you like burgers and one of a kind milkshakes you'll love Burgatory.
Food is always fresh, warm and cooked the way you ordered it. Service is great..."}
{"text":"I've been to this Burgatory a couple times.  It's never failed me.  I went there on New Year's Eve after walking out of Don Pablo's (it's the pits) and my wife and I enjoyed sitting at the bar.  They have a good beer selection, although I would appreciate a few more local brews.  The burgers are always good.  We are vegetarians, so we really appreciate a good housemade veggie burger and they've got it.  We've had the nachos too (minus the chicken chili) and they were good, but had just a few too many green peppers.  All in all, it was very good and we'll be back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in to waste time before Me and a few friends saw a movie. The place was packed but we were seated right away I ordered a regular beef burger with homemade chips and had a lemonade. The presentation was on point but the burger was dry and the meat was as thin as a sheet of paper, the chips were stale and were so greasy they were almost inedible. I customized my burger and when it was brought to the table there were a few items missing. Our waitress was so busy she only stopped past our table twice in the hour we were there including Taking our order. I was not too satisfied with the overpriced food given the quality."}
{"text":"My sister took me here when I was home in Pittsburgh and I'm in love. There were tons of options and for a first timer it was a little overwhelming. The server was kind enough to explain all of the rubs and sauces along with their applications to me so that I was able to put together a really delicious burger. Get the waygu beef it was plenty tender and full of flavor. I got mine medium but asked her to lean towards well. Usually I order my burgers medium but it was my first time here. I'll definitely have to return for a milkshake because if the quality that went into the burgers is as good as the shakes then they will be delicious as well."}
{"text":"I love Burgartory! I try to fix my burger a little different every time and it always comes out delicious. I just wonder if some of the customization get a little lost in the process. Like I feel like I can't really taste the difference between angel dust, diablo dust and Kingston jerk. No difference though. As long as my burger is tasty and cooked right I won't fuss. The $1.50 upcharge on the fries is not worth it. They were hard and crispy and for all that I could have just stuck with chips for free. 

I also had the chocolate milkshake. I know..how gluttonous of me. It was amazing. Everything is clearly fresh and made with quality ingredients. I think next time I will get my milkshake spiked...because they do that. 

Service was great once we got to the table but they quoted us at 10-15 minutes to be seated and we didn't get to a table for about 30 minutes. A little annoyed with that only because the hostess should just properly quote the wait and then we would have just gone to eat at the bar. 

Overall, delicious...great service and great ambiance. I'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Really great burgers!!!!! I'm not very adventurous when it comes to burgers but this place has every imaginable combination: meat, bun, topping, rub, etc..  I tried the cracked peppercorn rub on a beef burger - very, very tasty!  We also tried the angel/devil cupcakes which were very dry and one of the icings was too sweet for my taste.  I'll skip dessert next time but I will be going back for the burgers. One last comment, I think this is owned by the Uncle Sams people but the fries are not nearly as good as Sams (not bad tho)."}
{"text":"It was busy when we got there but thanks to the Nowait App we did not have to wait long. I had the Vegan Veggie burger on a brioche bun. It was delicious! I love the garlic mayo. The burgers come with chips but I paid the extra $1.50 for the sea salt herb fries. If you are going to call something herb fries you need to actually put herbs on them, not the 5 little flakes that were on mine. I added salt as well, but I like salty fries. They either need more servers or a staff person dedicated to refilling drinks because I had to wait a long time to get more iced tea."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh working for six weeks and I went to this restaurant every week. Very busy place, sat at the bar most times because it's open seating and they have a tall drink of water that's nice to look at behind the bar. The strawberry basil shag is a very good cocktail and super drinkable, two to three of them and I hand the keys to someone else. The burgers are delicious, my customer creation included pink waygu with cracked peppercorn rub on brioche topped with farmhouse cheddar, bourbon bbq sauce, fried egg, bacon, onion straws, pickles, and banana peppers. Spend the money for the fries and get ranch, yummy. The milkshakes are also delicious, thick and flavorful. This establishment needs to expand their brand to Texas, they would make a killing out here."}
{"text":"Great dining experience for the burger connoisseur. You can select a specialty burger from their menu or build your own from a wide variety of options. A little more than I'd like to spend on a burger, but the quality ingredients make up for it. I haven't had a chance to try one of their famous shakes, but they look delicious!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to Burgatory.The burger's here are simply amazing. I've been past multiple Burgatorys over the years, and never had a chance to stop We had a chance after the Pens game on Saturday, and I must say that the food did not disappoint. The ambiance is very modern and it has a very inviting atmosphere.The \"create your own\" burger is a fantastic concept from start to finish. The burger was cooked perfectly, and the seasonings/toppings were fantastic. The chips that come with it were phenomenal as well. I did not have a milkshake, although everyone raves about them. My only problem with this place is that the wait is astronomically long no matter what time you go in. This is why I've never went in the past. This obviously illustrates how great of a restaurant that Burgatory is, however, the service is ridiculously slow for a place that only sells burgers (service not being waiters, as everyone there was very friendly and welcoming, not their fault). I would definitely suggest this place, you just have to be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Well I guess I will have to be one of the naysayers when it came to my lunch today at Burgatory in the Robinson Town Center area. The straight up original burger tasted good but when the burger is so small that there is  over an inch of bun all the way around, it simply is not worth the $11.00 they charge. You would think the waitress would see that I had trimmed the bun all the way around, and would question why I did this. I'm not sure if they had a newbie in the kitchen or what, but I definitely will not return. Don't even get me going on the chips...simply awful-stale and almost burned. Again, for the prices they charge, throw in some fries without the extra cost."}
{"text":"Wow!  Fantastic burgers!!!!!  I had the piggy butter and jelly and OMG...flavor explosion!  Substituted the jalapeno cheddar cornbread instead of chips and I suggest everyone do that.. Was sooooo delicious words can't describe!   Definitely worth going to.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went tonight for first time!! Loved it!! Milkshake was awesome and create your own burger is great!!! Also love that the will text u when table is ready so u dont have to sit around waiting!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my husband for date night.

We each created our own burgers and were extremely happy with our choices. I got the chicken burger and it had more flavor than i was expecting. The potato salad was rather delicious as well. I absolutely had to try a milkshake, caramel pretzel. I was not disappointed.

The atmosphere was nice and the staff was friendly. The only downside, the don't wear uniforms so it was hard to tell who actually worked there."}
{"text":"Best Burgers and Shakes around. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Ok, by far the best burger place I have found out here in Pittsburgh while spending more and more time here for work.  

Don't come here if you want to eat light.  Good Lord I almost couldn't eat my meal when I got a shake first.   It started to fill me right up. 

So, as I said, I started with the Fluffy Nutter Butter something shake-  OMG , heaven in a straw... one of the best...ok actually... the best milkshake I have had in years.   I started sipping its deliciousness, only to fill up quickly... so I stopped and shared with the table.  Thank goodness, since I didn't want to miss what is next. 

Ordered some parmesan fries..... GREAT!!! I love when the fries have some of those tiny crunchy pieces. YUM.    And of course, the burger.  Super good, not dry, cooked just right... none of that grease ( save that for the fry basket. ) 

Yes, Good.  Great.  Just so super satisfying.   Not fast food, just good food.....   worth a try!!!"}
{"text":"Love the new Burgatory in the waterfront!  Great location!  This place is close to everything in the Waterfront.  They have so many options for making your own burger.  They also cooked the burger just they way I like it (and ordered it)  The toppings were fresh and tasty. The decor is fun too.  They have an enclosed pouch area--which is a plus for Pittsburgh.  I like to sit outside and can not always do it here because of the rain.  The enclosed pouch let's you sit outside without in any weather condition.  Especially love the funny fortune cookies you get after a meal!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburgh from San Diego with my family and relatives. We were a party of 10 and had just finished a tour of Heinz Field. I was starving since we hadn't eaten since breakfast and it was already 2:30. I had never been to Burgatory but IT DELIVERED. 

Huge onion rings, great pale ale and an awesome crab cake burger with slaw. I had samples from other plates and apps and they were also good. Cool environment, great service and unbelievable prices for something so close to both ball parks. The bill would have been double in downtown San Diego."}
{"text":"Bad news first: it's hot, stuffy, and the metal chairs are extremely uncomfortable. All of their mayo based sauces are made with mayo from a bulk distributor, so if you need hormone free eggs (I do because of allergies) you're out of luck. Service varies from decent to sketchy, lots of minor slips and confusion. Our server dumped sauce all over my pants. Finally, almost everything we ordered was very overcooked. My \"red\" burger was almost brown, fries were leathery, etc.

Now the GOOD: food itself is tasty. The wings are fried pretty hard and chewy, but the flavors are solid. Same goes for the onion rings. The burgers are the highlight, of course. Just wish they were prepared as ordered.

If you can get past the discomfort factor -- might not be so bad when weather is cool -- it's a decent choice for classic American food."}
{"text":"Used to be a good place. Now the customer service is terrible! Makes you want to leave before you even get to your table. They are unable to even manage a waiting list. Really sorry about this. As I said, used to be good."}
{"text":"Their Nutella Crunch Milkshake is the best milkshake I have ever had."}
{"text":"Straight outta Pittsburgh.....

Welcoming and knowledgeable staff. Great burgers. Amazing adult milk shakes. 

I ordered the standard deluxe burger. It was cooked just the way I like it. The buns were homemade and came  with house made chips. 

Mos def would recommend....."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, great service and a wonderful atmosphere. They get very busy and don't take reservations but they make up for that having an advanced automated txting system which allows you to do anything within 10 mins, once they txt you that it's time to be seated, you have 10mins to show up."}
{"text":"Great burgers!  I love that you can customize your order (fill out a sheet with all specifications, bread, meat, toppings etc. . ).  Great concept!  They also have suggestions of combinations as well.  I ordered my burger medium rare and it was perfectly cooked--many places do not know how to cook a good medium rare burger but Burgatory gets an A+  They have great (but HUGE) milkshakes too!"}
{"text":"we came here on a sunday with a group of about 15-20 people and they were more than welcoming to our group! burgatory has these amazing must try shakes (alcoholic shakes) that are delicious. i got the burnt almond torte shake (with some baileys). for burgers most of us ended up making our own burgers and they were delicious. all burgers come with a side of chips, but you could choose other sides as well (that are relatively healthier). the forms they had for create your own burger is so useful! for sauces some of us got the truffled aioli - it was pretty spicy. i usually like spicy food and thought it was spicy, so the jalapeños i got on the side of my burgers i didn't even end up using. either way, i'll definitely be back here when i come to burgh next time to try other burgers! 
ps. if you're trying to decide on whether or not to get the truffle fries, GET IT. they were AMAZING. probably the best truffle fries I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Sucks! Plain English. The waiting is too damn long. They bullshit around. Upon arrival we were told there was an hour waiting, and we waited. Time and time we noticed people coming in, and yet we were told they phone in. Shit, it's 9:48pm, it's been an hour already. When they finally seated us, we were offered the high chair and we wanted a lower chair, but once again nothing is available for us. 

Our waiter was good though, so he made our stay better."}
{"text":"My first overall experience at Burgatory was pretty amazing.  My friend and I arrived on a Tuesday evening and were told to expect a 20-30 minute wait but we got in after less than 15 minutes upon receiving a text message that our table was ready - a feature that I LOVE and I wish more restaurants would incorporate.

I decided to order a custom-made burger and my anticipation for my food to arrive was pretty intense.  To distract myself as I waited, we split an order of the truffle gorgonzola fries.  The fries were so-so, but the cheese was really delicious.  Our burgers arrived after a slightly longer than usual wait, and it was definitely worthy of a foodgasm.  I got a hormone-free beef patty, herbed focaccia bread, buffalo cheddar (which tasted just like nacho cheese - not quite my fav), sauteed mushrooms, onion straws, sour cream, and a fried egg.  We decided to nickname my burger The Escape Artist because as I was eating it, my egg kept trying to rapel out of my sandwich, despite my repeated attempts to seal its fate by stuffing it back in my sandwich.  I later discovered that the egg's repeated escape attempts were just a distraction to allow my onions and mushrooms to jump ship, because despite me finishing my huge burger with all the fixings, I had enough leftover onions and mushrooms to make my own plate of sliders.  Needless to say, they don't skimp on the toppings.  The side of sweet potato chips we received were also really nice.  Not at all greasy, they were a really nice, subtle compliment to that flavor monster of a burger.

We wrapped up our meals with a caramel pretzel milkshake.  Absolutely amazing.  The milkshake had actually hunks of pretzel in it, so it comes with a rather wide straw.  The milkshake was nice and thick but wasn't overly sweet.  It was a great way to end the meal.

The only con I have was that we were seated at a tall table accompanied by tall chairs, and the seats of the chairs were definitely on the small side.  It took a bit of adjusting to find a comfortable position, and I'm definitely requesting a table or booth the next time.

But overall, the food was really fantastic and I can't wait to get back there to create my next burger masterpiece!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so much fun.  I love building my own burger ... even if it's not with a burger.  The bins, cheese and topping choices are awesome and it has been delicious every time.   My kids love the milkshakes...well, they are grown up kids, but still think they're little boys when it comes to milkshakes.  If you're never tried it you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Waited nearly an hour for food. Salad made wasn't as described in menu. Manager did her best to make things right. I'm confident this bad experience was an anomily. Was first visit and will not rule out another visit."}
{"text":"Burger heaven more like it! Went early so didn't have a wait but by the time we left there was about a 30 minute wait which speaks to the popularity of this very small chain. The waitress we had (Jess) was very friendly and helpful to those of its who we're new. The onion rings and the pommes frites with truffle and gorgonzola were spectacular! ESPECIALLY the pommes frites...what a fabulous combination. Both were brought to the table piping hot which ahead makes the chairs and experience better. The burger choices ranged from some standard combinations all the way to the build it your own with an enormous number of possible combinations. Most of us built our own and you can literally choose everything about your burger...and the choices are dizzying and delightful! The burger is served with homemade potato chips from russet and sweet potatoes. Then there are the milkshakes. My non alcoholic Choco-taco was absolutely delicious. Made with crumbled waffle cone and peanuts and a nice big fat straw to get it all in. The price was a little expensive but considering the quality of the ingredients it was to be expected. By the way, I wouldn't suggest the herbed focaccia bread as it's just not sturdy enough. Other than that, my only other complaint is that I gave go to Pittsburgh to enjoy them so they really need to expand down into Maryland, preferably Sykesville! Also...GO STEELERS!"}
{"text":"Great custom burger with creative and really detailed menu. Good shakes too. We didn't have any drinks but looks like the bar has extensive drink selections. Love the decor and lighting."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to my first visit at burgatory but it was nothing more than average.

The service was just ok and the drinks from the bar took too long.  The meat in the burger was dryer than i like but the flavor was good but not great.

The server never cleared off our dirty appetizer plates but did get refills and check on how everything was.

I did appreciate the fact that they use the Nowait app.

Just an average experience and I would try it again it I happen to be close  but won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"My husband and I have ventured to the other Burgatory locations and knew what to expect regarding the food, decor/ambience, and service. Our expectations were met when we went to the newest location in Murrysville. Let me explain.

Food:  Between my husband and I we have tried nearly all of the burgers on the menu and have been extremely pleased with the quality of the ingredients used, the execution of our orders to a requested temperature (I order mine medium which equates to \"pink\" on their menu while hubby orders his well done   or \"no pink\"), and the inclusion or exclusion of particulars (no onion, etc.)  If you visit a Burgatory, please order one of the creations off the menu! My mother ordered a burger which she created and was not nearly as pleased with her order. I had ordered of the menu and gave her half of my burger (which she didn't order because it had things on it she didn't like). Trust the chefs. They know what they're doing. They trained to create a delicious menu and have done so. My favorites are the Morty's Steakhouse and the Pot Luck burgers. 

The burgers are served with house-made potato chips; a mix of both russet and sweet potatoes. These are epic. So delicious and well seasoned. If you're a big fan of fries, might I suggest an upgrade to the fries with your burger? Trust me, they're worth the upcharge. 

Additionally, we always split one of the adult milkshakes. We could both handle our own but they are sizable and consuming both a shake and burger just seems too gluttonous, even for my hedonistic lifestyle. If you are set on ordering your own milkshake, can I recommend ordering it in a to-go cup? Alas, in fairly certain they can't do this with the alcoholic shakes but they are happy to do so with the Virgin shakes.

Decor: The ceilings are high with an industrial feel, witty takes on the sinful consumption of rich burgers and adult milkshakes color the walls. The place can be loud, but wasn't too loud for careful conversation, especially in smaller groups. This spot is probably best for groups of 5 or smaller. The bathrooms are clean and the bar is bustling. 

Service: We did experience a slightly longer wait for our burger during our visit to the Murrysville location than to other locations, but since we never dine without the proper time necessary to enjoy our dinner and the evening (or lunch) out we were not distressed. The additional wait probably only required a few minutes longer than other locations, but considering we both felt we were starving the wait could have been only been 3 minutes while it felt like an eternity! In the end, the service was absolutely acceptable if not better than average. 

In summation, I recommend any location of Burgatory to the burger coinnoseurr who isn't afraid of paying a little more in order to enjoy quality burgers in a better atmosphere.  I recommend first selecting one of the burgers the Burgatory chef has created instead of creating your own (they went to school to craft these unique flavors people, they know what they're doing!) We will certainly be back to Burgatory in the very near future!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!!!! The food is fresh and always the way you want it...(especially since you can build it) the toppings for the burger range from vegetables to eggs, ham, bacon jam and truffle aioli...your choice of beef, aged waygu and elk plus ground turkey or chicken the choices are plenty! There also other alternatives instead of the burgers...chicken sandwiches and salads etc...the sea salt and herb fries you can never go wrong with they are amazing and tasty!!!! The heavenly milk shakes live up to their name! You can have a normal one or make it and adult by adding various liquors! I recommend the Cookie Monster it is an excellent milk shake to go with a burger...love burgatory Cannot put into words how good the food is you have to try it!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh. I love the idea of a build-your-own-burger place and the way it is executed here is nothing short of excellent. The chips that are served with the burgers are a mix of regular and sweet potatoes and were very good as well. We didn't have room to try any of the desserts, however we have heard from friends that the shakes are great. 

If there is one place that should tempt you to walk past Uncle Sam's, this is it."}
{"text":"You really want to plan ahead when you come here. Perhaps it's the location, but the wait time always seems to be an hour or more. Fortunately this is one of the few restaurants that have joined the technology revolution and they will text you when your table is available (and give you ten minutes to make it back to the restaurant.) 

The food here is PHENOMENAL mostly because you can create your own burger using whatever fine ingredients you like. Smoked Gouda cheese is a good choice. 

There seemed to be several customer service issues on our last visit: no bacon on my burger and no lemons with our water - despite asking for both. They were kind enough to try to fix things though. 

Definitely recommend this place but I guess patience and persistence is key if you plan on it."}
{"text":"Another great burger place- very similar to BRGR with the build your own burger and spiked shakes (I prefer BRGR shakes). I've been three times and it's always been very busy. Service is very quick and polite though. They offer a gluten free bun and are available to answer questions on the menu. I would say that I was able to order from about 50% of the menu (which I see as good odds). The atmosphere at this location, from my experience, has been very loud and crowded, so if you're looking for a quiet dinner or if you want to hear everyone in your group, I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Burgatory makes one of the best burgers you can find in Pittsburgh. I began going to the original Aspinwall location about 3 years ago and have been in love with the food and 
the brand ever since. 

First of all the restaurant itself is a great atmosphere. The whole heaven/hell thing is very creative. I'm always entertained by the wall art. 

The food is really incredible. They have about 8 or 10 signature burgers that are always on the menu as well as a Burger special that changes daily (if you want to find out what it is today just follow them on twitter). They also have an option to build your own burger. What I love about this is that Burgatory has a lot of unique toppings you won't find a lot of other places. But when I get a burger here a usually end up getting the Farmer Brown. I know they have so many unique and delicious options but there's just something about this classic burger with a gourmet twist I love so much! The only negative burger feedback I have is that I got a bison burger once and it was pretty dry. I imagine it's just a dryer meat, but I didn't like it so I wouldn't recommend that.

Even though you're probably going to Burgatory for burgers, they also have a lot of other great food as well. The pork belly sliders are incredible. I also really enjoy the fried mushroom appetizer. 

Unfortunately I can't really comment too much on the milkshakes. I had one a few years ago and from what I remember it was great, but every time I come here I come for the food. I can't fill up on a milkshake!

If you live in Pittsburgh and haven't gone to Burgatory yet, you need to go. Don't let the long wait reviews scare you. Yes you could be \"waiting\" for up to an hour or 90 minutes. But because Burgatory uses NoWait, they'll take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. That way you can walk around all the great shops at the waterfront. Charming Charlie is right next door! I could spend an hour in there alone! Just make sure you put your name in before you're really hungry!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped at Burgatory on a random Thursday evening just to get out of the house. I was excited to try it as I have heard great things, especially about their milkshakes. Parking near the restaurant can be challenging but we were willing to walk from Trader Joes' nearby. 

When we arrived, the restaurant was not very busy and we were seated
quickly. Our waitress was very nice and asked if we have been there before - since I have not been, she went over the menu and then the option to create your own burger. I was instantly drawn to creating my own as their specialty burgers did not appeal to me. I had an all beef burger with an all grains bun (very tasty), BBQ rub, bourbon BBQ sauce, bacon jam, grilled pineapple, lettuce, and red onion. The presentation of the food was good, however my burger was not even close to being the size of the bun nor was it very thick. I ordered a side of BBQ sauce (I like it saucy) which we were charged extra for. My husband added a side of ranch to dip his chips in and again, we were charged extra. Speaking of chips, good crunch however unevenly seasoned. 

We had to end our meal with a milkshake. We ordered the Fluffer Nutter and it was absolutely delicious! Make sure you share when you order a milkshake as they give you the extra amount that does not fit in the cup, so you are getting two for the price of one. 

I would return here any day for just a milkshake. My burger experience was sub par, and the extra charges seemed a little excessive, especially when you are already paying a good amount of money for the burger itself. 

See you again for a milkshake, maybe the boozy version next time!"}
{"text":"this place is as good as all the reviews stated! the elk burger was incredible as well as the caramel pretzel milkshake...Also a nice and adequate beer selection.."}
{"text":"Went here with the family after they picked my up at the Pittsburgh airport.  We sat on the enclosed patio, where we were able to see what was happening with the Penguins game.  The kids got menu's with games and things for them to do.  The menu had something for everyone.  My dad and I both ordered the \"Fork it\" - fries with cheese curds, gravy, short ribs, and cheese - it looked small, but was oh so filling!  The curds had that signature crunch, fries were nice and crispy, and the ribs were juicy and flavorful. Too bad because I really wanted to try one of those amazing looking shakes - that will have to wait for next time. It was a busy night - the night before Thanksgiving, but service was excellent and so was the food.  I love how the burgers come with a pitchfork poked into it - cute concept!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service at this location is so bad it brings it down to two stars. I've had two bad experiences here- the first time, our server completely ignored us most of the time. We had a 4 top and our drinks were empty for over half an hour with no one coming to check on us (and not at an overly busy time). Tonight, one friend and I came in at 8:30 to have dinner. Not a busy time, and again mostly ignored by the server. I ordered my food around 8:45 and said I had a takeout order I wanted to put in after my food comes out.. the server said I had to put it in right then because the kitchen closes at 10...in over an hour..for one to-go burger. Then, the staff openly talked about and laughed at my friend and I at the server station loud enough to hear, and mocked things I was saying. I have been a server for almost 6 years and am always extremely kind and understanding of wait staff. However, the staff here has crossed a line and even though their food is good, I will not return."}
{"text":"Exceptional service! 
My daughter has a medical condition where each gram of food needs to be weighed and proportioned right. Eating out is usually not an option for her but we thought we'd give her a treat and let her eat some of the fries. Forgot to take the weighing scale!! The staff and manager were exceptionally helpful, and super sweet in not only weighing the fries, confirming the exact weight twice, but also in making those few fries look pretty as they came stacked in a cool grid on a plate to our table- brought personally by the manager. Thanks, Jef, Ryan, Katie, Sara and Courtney - for not just adding some normalcy to our daughter's evening, but a dash of 'special' too. Your warmth was truly appreciated and moving. 
Oh, and the food rocks :)"}
{"text":"I love the gluten free burger here but they are way to small for the price. Ranch on my burger yes!!! Salad with ranch is good. Sure wish they offered more gluten free options. Milk shakes are super yummy!"}
{"text":"Good burgers. Excellent milkshakes. Gluten free burgers are delicious! Lemonade is excellent but no free refills! We where not told. Found out when we got the bill."}
{"text":"So there's obviously a lot of hype about this place.  We went with some people that had been there before, and they all seemed to enjoy it, but this place was not for us. 

First off, we get there, and they say there's going to be a 2 hour wait.  So fortunately, they text you when your table is ready, so you can walk around the waterfront.  Unfortunately, there's not 2 hours worth of walking around to do at the waterfront, so after about an hour, we were waiting bored for our table.  And then 2 hours turned into 2 1/2 hours before we actually got seated.

I got a milkshake, and that was very good, albeit a little pricy ($6).  The burgers however left a lot to be desired.  I got the farm burger, which has ham, cheese, and egg on it.  I always get the Royal Red Robin Burger, which is similar (minus the ham), and love that.  This however was not the best.  It was definitely lacking cheese.  I don't like hamburgers without cheese.  The beef patties on these burgers are big, so don't skimp on the cheese!  There was too much beef, and the beef was bland.  I ate about 75% of my burger and just gave up, because I didn't like it enough to finish it.  Too much bland beef taste, and not enough cheese/toppings.  

About half the people at our table of 8 didn't finish their burgers.   Not because it was too much food, just because we didn't really enjoy the burgers that much.  I was talking to a friend on the way out who didn't finish, and he said the same thing as me, too much bland beef, not enough cheese.

The fries and chips were good though, and as I already mentioned, so were the shakes, but this is a burger place, not a fry and shake place, so I can say with assurance I'll never be back.   I'd go to Red Robin (comparing it here, because it's right across the street) in a heartbeat over this place."}
{"text":"Best burger in Pittsburgh...super busy at lunch for those on a time limit. 8.00 milkshake is definitely something worth trying!!"}
{"text":"I loved Burgatory as a meat eater.  As a new-ish vegan, I love it even more.  One of the best veggie burgers I've ever had (much better than at Piper's Pub, one of my favorite restaurants in the city with vegan options). And..vegan milkshakes! With whipped cream! I feel like I'm back in Portland!

Keep up the great work, Burgatory."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin... This place shouldn't even be a reference to Purgatory because their milkshakes are HEAVEN. The Nutter Butter flavor is the best one they have by a long shot. As for the heavier fare, they offer small plates/appetizers as well as wings and burgers (the main event). Typically, red meat is not my favorite protein choice, but for Burgatory burgers I always make an exception. They have a plethora of toppings and each burger is totally customizable. Want peanut butter and pickles on a pretzel bun? Consider it done. The service is always great and I have never had a bad experience. The North Shore location is perfect for a bite to eat after a long day of singing Sweet Caroline and Hailing to Pitt at Heinz Field."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this burger restaurant! You will find a hamburger better than restaurant!!! You will pay a little bit more,but well worth the price!! Omg! These burgers are amazing! I also recommend getting one of there amazing milkshakes! Wow! You also get great service!!! 5 stars all the way!! I would give it 100 stars if I could!! WOW!! AMAZINGLY!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was pricy but oh so good! I had the \"Farmer Brown\" burger and \"Burnt Almond tote\" shake. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the reason I am giving burgatory 3 stars is because they charge you for every little thing. Extra dressing or sauce $1, substitute chips for fries $1.50. I got a salad, burger, and a kids meal and it came to $40 because they charged extra for chocolate milk and then charged again for the refill. After 4-5 visits, I think we are done."}
{"text":"This is the only place I have found to have Gluten Free buns in the area, and I live in Akron, OH!!!   Everytime we are visiting we have to stop to eat here.  Being Gluten Free and having to eat a burger with no bun is not the same.  It is a real treat to eat a hamburger with all the fixin's.  I always order the make your own burger and the staff is up to date on Gluten Free do's and don'ts.  Even this last time, we sat at the bar and the bartender was nice to tell me that the french fries are cross contaminated.  Its very rare to have such a knowledge staff especially since it is not a full on GF place.  It is a little pricey, but I'm use to paying more for GF food anyways.  The only complaint I have was the burger was a little too burnt on the outside, but the burger was still cooked perfectly on the inside.   Sit at the bar for quick service.  The bartenders always had our glasses full and we were in and out very quickly.  Can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"At first I wasn't impressed with this place. But the last 2 years they have really upped their game and became one of my favorite burger places in pittsburgh! Friendly staff and great quality food!"}
{"text":"Visited for lunch yesterday. It wasn't crowded at all, which was nice. We were seated at the front by the door where no one else was sitting. It seemed strange being that everyone else was seated closer to the bar area. It was also cold by the door. I mean it was only 14 degrees out. Our server was great. We each did a make your own burger. I had the chicken burger with a variety of toppings. It was good. Comes with chips for the side. They were okay too. My sister did get a free milkshake for her birthday. Must join the email club. 

Over all the experience and atmosphere are great if you are looking for something causal or a place to watch the game. For the menu - think burgers and fries with a twist. You can pick pre-set burgers or completely construct your own. Toppings range from the typical lettuce, tomato and cheese to caramelized onions and a fried egg. Come with a big appetite!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burger places out there. I came here on a Friday night and the wait was horrendous. Good thing it's located near a prominent shopping area so I was able to keep myself occupied for over an hour. Once my party was seated, the service and food was phenomenal. 

I opted for the custom creation beef burger with Cajun rub, truffle shallot aioli and a bunch of greens on a brioche bun. The burger was so juicy and flavorful. They were super generous on the aioli, which I really appreciated. I also had the chance to try their salted nutella crunch milkshake. Oh em gee...the milkshake was truly heavenly with the right amount of crunch, sweetness, creaminess and love. The best part of it all was how quickly our food came out, even though it was a busy night. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my time at the Burgatory. My gluttonous taste buds were quite pleased, along with my happy tummy. The long wait was totally worth it and actually not that bad if you just go shopping in the meantime. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for a make-your-own burger! They have plenty of topping, bun, meat, and sauce options that allow you to get something different every time you go. Their milkshakes are delicious and offer up unique flavors (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic). I love their branding on everything from their menus, to atmosphere, to the fortunes on the fortune cookies."}
{"text":"One of my top restaurants for burgers. Everytime I go, I am able to try something different on my burger. Their customize burger option allows you to select the meat, bun type, rub applied to the meat, a variety of condiments, the toppings and cheese. Each combination I've tried has been delicious. The meat is always cooked to my preference and very juicy. Milkshakes here are also incredible! They have many different flavors, as well as alcoholic and non alocholic options. The atmosphere of the restaurant is casual and fun. It's modern and makes you feel very comfortable, a great place to come with friends. The branding is seen throughout the restaurant. From the menu to the decorations, to the funny fortune cookies you get with your check. Overall, an awesome place to eat!"}
{"text":"Eclectic menu but average size portions. We sat at the bar and had average service. Great taste, creative menu."}
{"text":"So good.  My stomach is growling just thinking about it.

You have to try a spiked milkshake (espresso love is my go-to).  I also appreciate that they have a delicious vegetarian burger - it's made mostly of lentils, which I enjoy much more than black beans (most other restaurants do black beans).  The fries are great as well!  

The only reason that I give them a 4 instead of 5 is due to their policy on reservations.  We live about a half an hour away, so it's really irritating to drive all the way out to Waterworks only to wait for an hour and a half (seems to be the typical wait time).  Yes it's nice that they have the texting system, but I still think that we would visit more frequently if we could make reservations and be seated promptly."}
{"text":"I had the veggie burger and fries. The fries were not that great. I mean, they were good, but just not great. I actually liked the chips more than the fries... Burger was really good, but just too big. But, I am sure that plenty of people would be happy with that. Great food, and fast service!"}
{"text":"Pricey, but the selection is great. 
It is usually a busy place so def. make reservations beforehand !"}
{"text":"Burgatory has taken Pittsburgh by storm. I've eaten at a few of the locations now, but I prefer the staff at Robinson. The service is always good, the menu is diverse. I recommend the Portobello fries and always the cocktail menu."}
{"text":"I have been to burgatory several times but now i have a different view on places since having a baby. Burgatory is extremely stroller/child friendly. Staff was very accommodating. I ordered the crab cake burger will grilled onions, arugula and tomato. Sooooo good. We were there during happy hour so appetizers were half off. We ordered the sea salt and herb fries. Delicious!!! Will be back again."}
{"text":"My friend just came back to the seat with his Burgatory legendary burger.  Oh wait,  it's black and burnt to a crisp. So my friend goes back to return this lump of coal and instead of apologizing, the manager says the owner is here and he says that's the way they always cook them, well done!  Seriously disappointed, normally their burgers are decent and their fries as well, but a serious lack of brand consistency and apparently a policy of burning burgers until they are physically inedible, will stop me and my friends from eating there ever again!! I wish I took a picture of it!"}
{"text":"Have heard only high praise for Burgatory - and it lives up to the praise.   Even the chips are fresh made and magnificent

Good stuff"}
{"text":"This is my kind of restaurant.  Amazing burgers.  Totally incomparable. The gorgonzola fries are my favorite."}
{"text":"What else can be said that hasn't been already? Best burgers and milkshakes in Pittsburgh with an equally fantastic and friendly staff to match. Great curb appeal inside and out. A fun day or night out for sure! An absolute must taste!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. It was a really snowy, cold day and it was practically empty when we got there a bit before 8pm. It was nice to be able to park right out front and be seated right away. I assume this is different when there are Steelers or Pirate's games going on.

Seemed consistent for taste with the Waterworks Burgatory. Love that you can do the custom burger, and mostly do that. I got the chicken burger this time and it was really moist and tasty. Got the Eclair alcoholic milkshake, which was really good. Lots of eclair pieces in it, but I wish there was a little bit more chocolate. The fries were good, as always. 

While not the best burgers in Pittsburgh, I love that they have a large variety for their make your own burger and their milkshakes are always amazing."}
{"text":"Wow!!
Reading these reviews I must have come at a great time because I did not have to wait for a table at all.
I did however have to wait for the food to arrive but It was OK I was dining with a friend and I was not in a hurry.
If you have time then definitely go here for burgers , the burgers are delicious!!!!
If you are in a hurry do not!
Please  wait until you have time to come here and enjoy the delicious burgers and dessert."}
{"text":"Glad I went with my local friend's suggestion to take her here for lunch when I was in town. I am not a burger eater, but 2/3 of us were, and my food was still great anyway.

I had a customized chicken burger - gouda, mushrooms, spinach, truffled shallot aoli and it was totally delicious and NOT dry, with good flavor from the angel dust seasoning. Boyfriend had the farmer brown and enjoyed it, other friend had a custom one that she says is the best she's ever had. Upgraded to sea salt & herb fries which were well seasoned and crispy. 

We did have to wait a bit - first for the table, but we were seated quicker than promised and they text when it's ready. The burgers took a while but our waitress checked in with us, which was appreciated. Good times."}
{"text":"Burgatory is the best gourmet burger place in Pittsburgh. My boyfriend & I have tried all of them. I really like that you can create whatever burger you want & you get a side with your meal unlike most others. Their burgers, fries & shakes are amazing. If you're going to order a shake know they really fill you up & it'll be tough to eat burgers & fries too. My family visited  from OH & everyone loved it. For a party of 7, the food came really quickly & the waitress was really attentive. A must try!"}
{"text":"What a great urban take on burgers and fries! Stopped in here with my dad during our cross-country road trip. We had to wait about 45 mins for a table because it was so packed! I ordered a gluten-free burger and root beer float - my comfort foods. The burger was tasty (ordered it with no pink) and the gluten-free buns were great. I ate the sweet potato chips the day after and they were really tasty. My dad ordered a chicken salad and it was gimongous! Our waitress was really attentive and helped us out a lot. I would definitely like to come back to try the other burgers."}
{"text":"Six months since my first meal here I think it's time to bump my rating up. At this point they've earned it, and I've learned through additional visits that on a good day this Burgatory definitely deserves 4 stars now. (On a bad day I'd still lean toward a 3 though.)

Back when I first visited I was not impressed because, after months of being told Burgatory is the greatest thing EVAR, I received a dry overcooked burger that did not melt in my mouth the way a great burger is supposed to. It was disappointing, but fortunately since then the burgers have been much tastier and juicier. Admittedly this positive trend has usually been when the place is not 100% jampacked with people. When the place is packed - which is the norm - the quality definitely dips back towards that dry burger I remember from visit #1. Since the business of the place affects just how good my burger is, I now know when to give them a pass in favor of cheaper grub. 

Another big thing I like is that they offer to-go cups for the shakes - something that I DEFINITELY wish I had known about when I first ate here! I mean really, I'm not going to Burgatory without getting a milkshake. Their standard menu alone is amazing - nevermind how great it is to stop in for the specials, like the Thin Mint shake they served back in March! But when you go with friends who all want something different it's simply impossible to share the behemoth plates and cups of food and drink here. A to-go cup means I'm now able to enjoy all of my food, without forcing myself to eat all of the food in one sitting. Yay!

They're still not my favorite burger place, because there are places in Pittsburgh that don't just make good burgers, but which make truly great, mouthwatering burgers - something I admittedly still haven't gotten from Burgatory. But at least now when my friends suggest Burgatory I can get excited about enjoying a reasonably good burger - and that's a definite improvement!"}
{"text":"So most of my thoughts about the Waterfront's Burgatory apply to this Burgatory, too. That said, a key difference is that I've actually never had any problems getting a table here. I guess that's mostly because when I visit the Robinson location I plan on going during its slower hours in the day, whereas I only ever visit the Waterfront with friends and as a result we tend to hit that Burgatory during meal rushes. (That and, let's be real, out of all the places to eat in the Waterfront Burgatory's one of the best - so everyone wants to eat there!)

Like its sister location, this Burgatory carries the famous Burgatory custom burger option while also offering a menu full of fries, sandwiches, and even salads that you can order, too. However, while I've mentioned some dissatisfaction with the quality of beef burger I've gotten at the Waterfront, I admit that I haven't really put this location to the test yet beef-wise. This is because I usually end up eating here when they have a special milkshake that I just MUST have, right now, before they disappear, because oh my Lord is anything better than a Burgatory milkshake... But since shakes with alcohol can't be taken home, I've started ordering salads with my boozy milkshakes since they're easier to take home. Yep, I'm that person who orders salad at a burger joint. Sorry - not sorry!

The exception to my \"milkshake and salad\" rule here was when I stopped in to try the Thanksgiving turkey burger recently. OMG. I told a friend that the Gobblerito has met its match in this burger, and I meant it. Every Thanksgiving \"must\" had been crammed onto that meal, and it was the one time I ended up eating my burger with a fork rather than my hands. After eating that delicious monstrosity, I'm honestly ready to come back and eat more burgers...well played, Burgatory. Well played.

Anyway, my final thought on this location is, if you like Burgatory in general, you'll like it here. They make AMAZING milkshakes, as we've come to expect from Burgatory. The burgers can also be quite amazing - although I'd honestly recommend a salad even more than a burger, if you're looking to get your money's worth. Even the hungriest diner probably won't be able to finish those massive salads. So go ahead: stop on in and justify your milkshake order with a big ol' salad to go with it!"}
{"text":"This is my updated review! I am still very happy ! I had a bison burger with the lettuce wrap. It was amazing ! I had honey habanero sauce, peanut butter, bacon jam, avocado, jalapeños, and banana peppers with baked beans. 
I never thought lettuce wrap would be good but it was so lite and filling . The peanut butter just makes the sandwich. I had great toppings and the whole meal came together. End review update :)





I always love a good burger . There is nothing better than a burger and a beer. 

I had the veggie burger on a wheat bun. It was very good and fresh. Make sure you have the bacon jam. It was delicious and made the sandwich complete.

The service was amazing . Our server knew the menu from front to back. She even knew all the beers. She suggested really good beers to go with our burgers.

I would absolutely come back here to get another burger. I would love to try their milkshakes because I heard they were phenomenal."}
{"text":"I had the Buffaloaded burger, and it was really good! It had just a little spice and a tasty flavor, and the burger was not tough or dry. The chips that came with it were also pretty good, just plain salted.

If it matters to you, the decor is mostly red and black. There are TV's above the bar, and both booth and table seating."}
{"text":"I had a lot of fun here. They provide you with the option to build your custom burger or order from their menu. I opted to build my own burger, as I was checking of my selections on the slip I was so surprised at all the options. They had things I have never even heard of ( maybe because I am not a heavy burger eater) and I decided to try some knew things. My partner and I had a blast picking out our orders, we ended up selecting a combination of things we never had before to be put on our burgers for the sake of being adventurous . When they brought them out they were huge! I was halfway expecting to get some crazy burger with a bunch nonsense inside of it that I would take two bites of and put down. That was not the case at all. My burger was delicious and so was my partners ( we took half of each others burgers to see who had a better one, I did). The staff was wonderful and very knowledgeable of the menu and did not mind are many questions. The décor is trendy and the vibe is pretty good as well. When you get your check they also give you little fortune cookies with funny meat-related sayings. I was very pleased with my experience."}
{"text":"I thought this place was decent.  We went on a Saturday afternoon and got there about 15 minutes before the place filled up and luckily had no wait.  The servers were nice and it was very casual.  I enjoyed doing the create your own burger since I am very picky, my husband went with one of their other burgers.  I got a milkshake as well, which was AMAZING, even though I got one without the alcohol.  The burgers were good, but I feel like they were a little too expensive.  The biggest issue for me is that my bun fell apart almost as soon as I started eating, so it was definitely a challenge to eat the burger.  Nice place, but not quite 5 stars."}
{"text":"Definitely overrated. 5 Guys is right next door and is a better deal with very comparable quality and better customer service. The staff at Burgatory made us feel like we were a bother. They were more interested in standing around in little groups and hanging out with off-duty staff than taking care of their guests. The burgers certainly were not bad, but they are far from worthy of the praise read in other reviews."}
{"text":"Our family ate dinner tonight.  I enjoyed being able to use the tear-off sheets to order your burgers just the way you wanted them.  The food was good, but the service was VERY slow!  We waited over an hour for our food and didn't receive refills on our drinks until we flagged down the manager.  I would recommend not eating here during their busy time!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best burger in the city. I recommend the truffled aioli sauce and the arugula as toppings. The spiked shakes are indeed heavenly."}
{"text":"For all the hype and everything associated with this place.....NOT impressed to say the least ...the burger sucked the fries were crap just overall everything was such a waste...I don't see why people get a hard on for this place the food BLOWS"}
{"text":"Heard about the place, decided to give it a try. Big mistake. 45 minute wait for bad service, an extremely high noise level( don't go there to chat, you have to yell), really mediocre  burger(had the recommended Morty's burger , it tasted like cheap ground meat with Lipton's Onion Soup Mix). Very very very greasy. Dining companion wasnt pleased either. Cross this one off the list. If I want to pay $42 for two burgers and an ice tea, I will go back to BRGR."}
{"text":"Siracha wings, gorganzola.truffle oil fries, and two custom creation burgers were all very good. Couldn't resist trying the banana ketchup w/ jerk seasoning banana peppers & lettuce tomato & red onion on brioche bun. Terrific taste & cooked perfectly med rare. Great little place. Will be back 2 try something else."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and wait staff! ( would be 5 if not for their terrible service)
Absolutely embarrassing and unprofessional front of house staff. Literally cannot tell time, were texting while guests were trying to talk to them. Sad"}
{"text":"Just arrived in town and stopped in for a quick bite.   Had the nachos (shared) and elk burger.   Beer selection is great, but not as good as our awesome server, Hank.   The fortune cookies were fun!  We look forward to stopping in next time we are in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I went again. After the last time, I was pretty confident that I could live the rest of my life never going back to Burgatory, but I went because my friends wanted to go. They liked their meals, but I did not, and sure enough, not an hour later, I already feel sick. I had the bison burger with Cheddar, mushroom, and the focaccia bread bun. The mushrooms were cold and there were about 10 tiny cheese shreds on the burger... that's all. I asked for and was given a little dish of more cheese, and that was nice, but come on. It's a cheeseburger and I am paying extra for cheese. Put some on my burger. The waitress was very pleasant and the fries were still good, but this time, my burger was SO not worth the way I feel now."}
{"text":"As you can see in other reviews, the burgers and shakes here are good, maybe even great.  I will focus my review on the atmosphere and beer selections.  

When arriving to Burgatory, you will undoubtedly be welcomed by a line of individuals waiting for a table and complaining about the long wait.  Regardless of lunch or dinner/ weekdays or weekends, there will be a wait.  Once inside, the restaurant is tightly packed and loud.  As you can imagine, the turnover is important to keep the aforementioned line moving, so meals are served quickly and the staff seemingly pressures patrons to finish and relinquish their table.  I am a fan of Burgatory as the take-out options are of the same quality and you do not need to put up with 45 minutes of the above mentioned atmosphere.  

The beer selections, however, may keep you tuned at the bar while you wait for your take out order or make the stale atmosphere more palatable.  From rotating taps, to local craft bottles, the selections will usually have a discovery for even the well traveled brew explorer."}
{"text":"So I'm moving to Pittsburgh very shortly and ventured to the area to look for apartments. I decided to check out burgatory. This is the best burger that I have had in a very long time. As a yeah burger fanatic, I can honestly say this was an ass whopping of taste for around the same price. I had the beef burger on wheat with cheddar hot cheese, lettuce, onion straws, bbq sauce, the bourbon bbq rub and bread and butter pickles. Ik ik.

This was the first place I had eaten from ik Pittsburgh and I'm already planning to go back. Good job burgatory."}
{"text":"Favorite chain, hands down. I am a burger-lover. Never thought I would order a chicken burger over a beef burger, but I can't go back to beef after trying their chicken burger (ground chicken, not chicken breast FYI). Topped with the farmhouse cheddar and arugula, OMG. The fries, the salted caramel pretzel shake, I can't get enough of this place. North Side is the best location for sure."}
{"text":"This place never gets old. I love being able to create my own burger. I love love burgers, and I never thought I'd order a chicken burger, but I literally can't order anything else because it's just so good. Like unbelievably good, every time. I switch up the toppings, and I tried the house made chips this time instead of their delicious fries, and they might actually be better than the fries, which I didn't think was possible. They are so crispy and fresh. Sometimes you get a sweet potato chip or 2 in the mix, and wow-soo good! And you can never go wrong with the salted caramel pretzel shake. Omg. The pretzels are crispy, the milkshake is super creamy, and the caramel just seals the deal."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is meh! When we first walked in, the hostess didn't greet us, she just started walking away and then turn around and was like \"ya'll can come.\" It was a Saturday at 9, but we got the vibe that she didn't want to be there. 

The server was ok. She got our food order correct so good enough for me.

The milkshake - i cant remember the name but it had khalua, chocolate, and caramel - was really tasty. However, you can ask for a virgin one cause it's not much alcohol used. 

The burgers were delicious and filling. My husband and I both had leftovers to bring home. 

Overall, great if you just want a good burger and don't care about the service."}
{"text":"Second time coming here and this is one of my favorite places to come to enjoy a delicious burger in the Burgh! Love the decor and whole atmosphere of the restaurant. I've never even heard of an alcoholic milk shake before coming here, they are delicious and more restaurants should have these on their menus! There is a huge variety of what types of burgers you can order or to create your own. The burgers were perfectly cooked and enough to have 1/2 for dinner or your fourth meal. Service is always great and they have a great selection of beers!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Created our own burgers and had a lovely experience. Try the Fluffer nutter butter shake!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. The crazy thing is that the burgers are a close second to their salads. I ordered a salad for takeout one day and after I got back to work and devoured it, I realized they are no joke.

On my most recent visit I had the burger topped with pot roast and gravy. I normally order my burger med rare but here it's red center, pink center or ? In any case, what I received was more leaning towards well done. I'm not going to knock them for that because it was still juicy and had good flavor. The gravy, cheese, onion curls and horseradish cream was the true icing on the cake so to speak and the flavor of the roast was just ahhhhmazing.  I'm not a person who loves fries but I found myself eating all if them here and looking for more...thank God I have girlfriends who share! ;)  The $8 tiny margarita was sooooo tiny but it was refreshing. I enjoyed the fresh juices they used and it was a standout from some of the other margaritas made from prepackaged mixes which are served around the area. I capped off my meal with a nutter butter fluffer (whatchamacallit) shake to go. It was good but I will say the texture of the crushed cookies got to me after a couple sips. I think it could do with less cookie and still be very good. It started to get a bit gritty.

So, why 3 stars? Well, our server was a tad bit tacky. For example, reaching over our foods right in our faces in mid conversation. No excuse me or pardon me and it was weird/awkward. We needed takeout boxes and she put them down in front of my friend on the opposite side of the table and almost took off her face when she did it. The other issue is their floor. It's not just this Burgatory either, I've been to the one in Robinson too and it's the same. It's slippery as heck so don't wear heels. Thank God I didn't wear them today. Even in flats I had to be extremely careful. 

It's been over a year since my last visit to Burgatory prior to the other evening. While I can't say I will never visit again, there's nothing making me want to immediately visit again."}
{"text":"This is by far the best burger I've ever had, not just in Pittsburgh but anywhere I've been in the country. BRGR offers a pretty good burger, but it's not on the same level as Burgatory.

The burger itself was thick and juicy, and came cooked perfectly medium rare- something that's easier than you think to mess up as I've had numerous other places over or under cook mine.

I created my own burger instead of going with what's on the menu, but that wasn't because the menu didn't have things that really appealed to me- I just wanted to pick a bunch of my favorite toppings.

I went with applewood smoked bacon, crispy onion straws, and Gorgonzola cheese on my dry aged wagyu burger, and the toppings were a perfect match for the great burger.

Then I added one of their interesting alcoholic milkshakes, the Rice Krispie Treat one, and have to say that was also very impressive.

Even the decor gave you plenty to look at.

My trip had a long wait but it was well worth the wait and the slightly higher than average burger price to have the best burger experience of my life."}
{"text":"Other than big milkshakes it really is just meh. Same ole burgers, nothing new, and they aren't even that exceptionally done. Potato salad that tastes as bad as it looks...overpriced for what it is. It's a hard pass if you ask me."}
{"text":"This is my third stop on my Pittsburgh Pennsylvania trip. I was told about this place by some friends and had to check it out. Overall it's a burger place like five guys and fuudrockers. They advertise all organic and grass fed but it's a burger joint. The highlight of my meal was the cookies shake, it was delicious! The burger was cooked perfectly but nothing stood out. The French fries were stale and greesy. The staff was friendly and the service was quick, they obviously care to turn tables around. If you want a burger out of the common places, this will be a good spot."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because the food is soo greasy and unhealthy... That being said - it's definitely a sinful delight! From the build your own burgers to decadent adult shakes - I always feel like I need to go to confession afterwards!"}
{"text":"I've been to Burgatory quite a few times and it is one of my favorite places to grab a burger and a shake. 

We were meeting some friends who already had a table when we arrived. When we sat down, the waitress came by and took our drink orders. She came back a little while later to take all of our food orders. 

Anytime we come here, we usually do the custom burgers and make our own. I generally get the same thing (haha) and it wasn't as great this time. The burger didn't taste that good and I had very little fries. I was pretty disappointed since we don't have this restaurant back home and was excited to visit it since it's been a while.

Also, the waitress didn't keep up with our drinks as we had ordered additional beers that she forgot about. We also didn't have the chance to order shakes before she brought the bill out; so, I just said to forget it. 

I'm certain I'll be visiting Burgatory again the future - probably just not this location."}
{"text":"My brother, our friend, and I went to dinner before going to the Benedum Center. We joined the waitlist ahead of time so that when we got there our wait time was shorter (highly recommend doing this!).

We all created our own sandwiches, so we filled out a checklist of what we wanted. The only problem I had was that I didn't get my tomatoes I checked off.  We had the Wagyu beef, veggie burger, and crab cake. All were delicious!"}
{"text":"My friend and I tried to go here on Friday night, but the wait was still an hour at almost 8:00 pm. So we went back on Saturday afternoon at 1:30 pm and waited 40 minutes. 

In my group of four, we had three milkshakes, two sandwiches, and one order of fries. Two friends split a burger. There were so many burger options that I ended up with the crab cake sandwich, only without the sriracha remoulade. When my my sandwich came it had the sauce on it. Once I got my server's attention, she took it back and brought a new sandwich. It was temperature hot but had a slight kick of flavor, could've been the chip flavoring though."}
{"text":"Sometimes I don't know if I really like the burgers or I just come here because I'm in love with the Salted Caramel Milkshake.  If you haven't tried the milkshakes, you must.  Don't have room for the burger and the shake?  Skip the burger.  Seriously though, the burgers are really good.  They have lots of options.  I love the build your own burger.  They give you a checklist and you go through and pick the type of bun, burger and toppings you'd like.  The toppings range from ordinary to extraordinary.  This is a fun place.  It is a little pricey, but a nice treat.  Use the No Wait App to cut your wait.  I've had to wait as long as two hours on a weekend."}
{"text":"We arrived early, around 4:40pm and the 6 of us were all seated promptly. The waitress was quick to take our drink orders, and then gave us plenty of time to pore over the menu. For my drink, I ordered Rosemary's Smash, which is a gin and tonic cocktail with cucumber and rosemary. There wasn't much rosemary flavoring, but cucumber/gin/tonic combination was delicious. I'd get this again.

The create-your-own burger sheets aren't lying when they say that it's probably the hardest decision of your life. I went through 3 before deciding to alter one of their signature burgers to my liking. The possibilities are endless and I'm looking forward to future visits and exploring more of the combos. 

As for the burger itself, it came out just as I had ordered it on the sheet. Slightly pink in the center, and very flavorful. I can't see rating them on flavor combinations since that decision is basically in your hands. For the rest though, a solid 4/5. I need to go back to try the hard milkshakes as well..."}
{"text":"I love their milkshakes!! I have been here only a handful of times, but I never really had a bad experience. The burgers are good and the bread seems to always be fresh. You get a wide range of variety when it comes to the \"build your own burger\". You get chips with your meals, so if you're a fry person heed my warning! Portions are also reasonable, but in my opinion this place is overpriced. It seems to be good quality though, so that's probably why. Milkshakes can run around $6-$9 depending if you get alcohol or not. Still good food though definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Coworkers and I were in the area for meetings, and some locals recommended Burgatory for lunch. It wasn't too packed on a Tuesday afternoon and our party of 8 was seated immediately.

The whole concept of \"Hard Shakes\" was interesting, but unfortunately I wasn't able to indulge (lactose intolerant)...though I do think it's super cool that they have dairy-free shake options. Espresso Love and Cookie Monster seemed like popular shakes at our table. 

For food my coworker and I split a Trippin' Chicken and Phat Patti's Veggie. The Veggie was alright -- I've had better veggie burgers elsewhere, though the guacamole was a yummy addition. The Trippin' Chicken was absolutely delicious, and everything from the pretzel bun to the black truffle mayo created an explosion of flavor. Highly recommend! 

Servers were very attentive and friendly. We were able to request separate checks without any issue (is it just California where this is difficult for large parties?), so I was happy with the experience. But it's a super heavy meal and it's almost guaranteed that you'll hate yourself after, so plan for it."}
{"text":"Went to Burgatory afresh Sundays ago for the first time. My husband got a burger & chips. But I don't eat hamburgers and decided on as an appetizer Gorgonzola fries in truffle oil!! Loved it especially after the server accidentally spilled the first order of fries!
Second order I almost cancelled my Drunken Crab Salad made with Bloody Mary vinaigrette which was awesome! Closest thing to order a crab salad in Ocean City or Bethany Beach Maryland! Try it!!!"}
{"text":"Walked from Mount Washington to the North Shore to have a birthday meal with family. We don't have Burgatory in Dallas, so I crave it when I'm out of town! We show up to find that the exhaust system is down, so they can only do shakes and salads.. That's fine, it happens, and I'm sure the restaurant was upset that it was missing out on profits on what is probably one of the busier days of the year. We went to Bar Louie for dinner, but I decided that I still needed that Nutella Crunch milkshake. I ran over in pouring Pittsburgh rain, and to my surprise, the host informed me that they were closing. At 7pm. When they're not supposed to close until 10. It really put a damper on my day, visit to Pittsburgh...and my clothes."}
{"text":"i love this place! It's the standard I measure all burgers on. When I am in Pittsburgh it's on my list of MUST VISITS. While the choices and combinations get overwhelming I get er done. And their spiked shakes are AMAZING. Next visit I'll update my review with details!!!"}
{"text":"First time. Great burgers. Off the shelf or build your own. We will be back. Fresh everything. Simply the nest burger i have had in years."}
{"text":"Best burger, mortey's steakhouse, best fries and house sauce to go with it. It had a hint of cinnamon. Great service, thanks to kaiya, first time and experience here great."}
{"text":"Service good.  Beer good.  Burger was just OK.  Over cooked burger.  Stale bun.   Soggy fries.  
Restaurant is busy, so maybe I was just unlucky.  Five Guys next door would have been a better choice (other than no beer..)"}
{"text":"Chili = awesome
Burgers = awesome
Milkshakes = awesome

Fantastic place. Friendly people. Lots of fun. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Amazing Burgers! They even have a create your own where you check off different rubs, sauces, meats, etc. AWESOME MILKSHAKES! I got the salted Nutella and it was amazing! Everyone at my table had a great time and servers were very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. They have endless choices of creating your own burger. I had the fifty fifty burger with sweet onion rub horse radish sauce and cheese with grilled pineapple and it was amazing. We were there during happy hour so it was half off apps. We samples the ribs and nachos and the portion sizes were huge. By the time we got our burgers we were full. The milk shakes are amazing we tried the cookie monster and the smores. We liked them so much we took some home."}
{"text":"This place was good at one time...what happened.
I could hardly eat my sandwich . The kitchen staff Hangs out at the bar , serving me a burnt sandwich. Won't be back as it rapidly declines."}
{"text":"It's pretty simple....Burgatory lives up to the hype and is the best burger place in Pittsburgh.

Edit:  I find this location superior to the other locations.  Not all Burgatories are the same in my opinion."}
{"text":"I ordered a single order of fries. Had a taste for fries. I always ask for my fries to be done extra crispy. The manager brought out a bucket of slimy wiggily fries. They came out only about 45 seconds after I placed the order. I asked him, are these extra crispy? The manager made up some ridiculous story about how fresh cut fries can't be cooked extra crispy and that these fries were put down for extra time. I laughed at him and he took the order back to have it done again. After a few minutes some extra crispy fries came out.

Incompetent manager, otherwise great service from the server."}
{"text":"I guess there was toomuch hype over this place, because when I finally went, my husband and I were both disappointed.  We both felt that it was just an overpriced burger.  Not to mention our service was pretty bad and we were left without drink refills, and waited forever for both our bill and for her to cash us out.  Don't plan to return."}
{"text":"This place is great. Cool atmosphere with great staff. Some unusual burger options. Everything I have ever had is great. The garlic fries are really good. The milk shakes are good. The prices are reasonable. They are always busy."}
{"text":"Downtown Pittsburgh has a wealth of dining options, which can be daunting to those who have not been there.  However if your looking for that ultimate burger experience Burgatory should be on your bucket list. To start off it's very similar to build a bear. Start with the stuffing (the protein), I chose the Elk. Then pick you rub, sauces, toppings and then finish off the masterpiece with the body. I went with the Pretzel roll. Super delicious. The prices are slightly higher than a typical burger joint, but this is not typical. Wide selection of adult beverages to include adult shakes. Definitely a great place to go while in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with build your own burgers. The burgers are always top notch. The staff is always very friendly.  Their t.v.'s are positioned perfectly so that you always have a good view. Also the whole theme is a neat idea. Pretty solid beer selection. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait but I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I heard fabulous things about Burgatory and decided on going there for a Tuesday night date. We got there late, around 8:45, and we were seated immediately, although it was moderately busy. The craft beer selection was great, which my boyfriend really enjoyed. He was most excited about the Wagyu beef option for his burger (for those who don't know, Wagyu beef is supposedly the best kind of meat for a burger because of the high fat content and marbling, plus it is aged to perfection). He created his own burger with the Wagyu and I opted for the Farmer Brown, which featured a fried egg on an angus burger. Burgers are served with homemade chips, so no fries, which was a bummer. I didn't mind, because my burger was absolutely delicious! I'm not a huge red meat eater, but I devoured the whole thing! 

My boyfriend had a completely different experience... He HATED his burger. I tasted it and the meat was gross. It felt like it was sand in your mouth and it was obviously not cooked slow enough. It left an awful taste in your mouth and overpowered all of the other toppings on the sandwich. He ate maybe a third of it before calling it quits. For paying top price for the Wagyu beef, he was very disappointed, and said he would pay more money at a more expensive restaurant to have it cooked correctly. 

As for the other food, we had onion rings which were better than average, but the chips were just so-so. We ordered milkshakes at the end; I got the non-alcoholic PB&J, he got the Burnt Almond Torte Shake, which featured cake from Prantl's, amaretto, and vanilla vodka. He loved his, which redeemed his faith in the restaurant after his bad burger. Mine was meh... chunks of jelly in your mouth just tastes weird. I wish they would have blended fruit in instead of actual jelly. Or at least mix the peanut butter and jelly together before blending in the ice cream to make it smoother. 

As for service, our waitress was mediocre and seemed to forget about us a little. I understood that it was close to closing time, but that's no reason to ignore your customers. 

In all honesty, we most likely will not be going back."}
{"text":"I gave the original a 5 star rating.  Although this location is solid, it does not live up to the original.  I ordered a ground chicken burger at both locations within the same week.  The burger at the Murrysville location was overcooked and the chips were overdone as well.  Plus one of my bartenders checked her teeth in a pocket mirror and cleaned her teeth with her finger."}
{"text":"Long wait for food after ordering. Inattentive staff. no WIFI Burgers only Ok, home fried chips were overcooked and burnt. Had to find staff to get bill."}
{"text":"1st time at a Burgatory.  Passing by Pittsburgh from NY.  At the bar area on Friday evening (before Easter Sunday 2018).  Place was packed.  Got the Deluxe w/ cheese which came with (AWESOME) kettle chips.  My brother got the Steakhouse and the Smore shake.  Great food, great atmosphere, the bartenders were attentive and very nice."}
{"text":"Holy smokes. Piggy Butter and Jelly was amazing. But even more amazinger (that's totally a word) was the service. Amanda was awesome. We never saw the bottom of our glass, she called us by name and interacted with our baby to keep her happy.  Even gave her a goodbye hug. 

Our whole trip we decided not to eat anywhere we could eat at Kansas City. Every service experience has been disappointing. Except this one. We'll definitely be coming back!!'"}
{"text":"Incredible taste to the 3 items I ordered.  I had the caramel pretzel milkshake and my day could have ended perfectly right there. Yes, ended. I had the milkshake first! Then came the biggest, best onion rings ever. I cut one of the 5 rings into 8 bite size pieces of deliciousness. Finally my \"standard\" burger arrived and wasn't disappointed with this either. I was only able to finish half. Ended up taking the burger and leftover shake out the door with me. 
My boyfriend had similar experience with s'mores shake and the bison burger. 
Waitstaff was good and attentive."}
{"text":"Custom burgers are delicious.
Lots of choices for meat and toppings.

Always a long wait so be prepared."}
{"text":"So Burgatory in the Waterfront looks  the same as the other Burgatories in the city, but I can tell you there is something better about the food at this location. Perhaps the chef? I am not sure.

Regardless, this is an excellent burger/milkshake shop. Great place to stop while in the waterfront."}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is awesome! Appetizer was the best pommes frites I've had. I had a standard burger which was delicious. Try the garlic mayo, it's yummy. My boyfriend had the meet your maker burger and lived it. Even the chips served with the burger are wonderful. We split a Carmel pretzel milkshake and it was out of this world! Don't miss this place. A little expensive but sooo worth it!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype!  My table has been silent since the food arrived. Everyone is immersed in their scrumptious meals, even my kids who don't eat burgers. They're licking their fingers.  Meat your maker and margarita. Can't go wrong. Even the bun was good."}
{"text":"If it wasn't because this place is so loud I would have given it 5 stars because the burgers are delicious. The music is played way too high which causes everyone to talk louder.We left with our ears ringing. Please, please, please lower the volume, people will have a much better experience."}
{"text":"I tried their location in Fox Chapel a couple of years ago and wasn't impressed, but I've been to the Homestead location twice and really enjoy it! I had the crabcake burger the first time--the crabcake was BIG, and messy, with coleslaw and Sriracha remolaude totally falling out everywhere. It was good, but I prefer the beef burgers. My recommendation is garlic mayo, arugula, farmhouse cheddar, and crispy onions, with the burger cooked medium. With their rosemary fries instead of the chips (which are good, but sort of superfluous compared to the fries). You can't go wrong!

Let's talk shakes. I like the idea of their creative shakes--with flavors like Prantl's burnt almond torte, smores, and coffe-and-doughnuts. But do there have to be giant chunks of pretzels/cake/chocolate in every single one? Last time I was there I had the mocha shake with coffee liqueur, which had huge pieces of chocolate-covered espresso beans in it. That's all well and good, but I don't really want to chew my milkshake, particularly when I'm tackling a giant burger alongside it. So while I give Burgatory the edge when it comes to the burgers themselves, I'm gonna have to cede the boozy-milkshake award to BRGR. They DO have a good beer selection here, though, so just have some hops and malts for dessert. :)

I've also tried the portobello steak fries, and I'm a sucker for portobellos so I enjoyed them. All the appetizers really need to be shared amongst a HUGE group, though, as that plus burger plus booze/ice cream/booze and ice cream is really too much to be handled by one mortal."}
{"text":"I'm not sure that it's all it's hyped up to be but I still think it's a neat experience.
The milkshakes are incredible and filling. They have a nice veggie burger option. I do suggest getting the fries instead of the chips though. The chips are always undercooked yet burnt."}
{"text":"Went to Burgatory last summer for a date with my sweetie. The burgers and toppings are fresh and delicious. We loved being able to choose all of our own toppings and sauces. Very similar to another location I've been to, which shows consistency, so that's a good thing! Our server was nice. I do remember being fairly close to our neighboring diners though. So, not super private."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.
We got on the wait list through the Yelp app and was seated as soon as we arrived. 
We ordered the fork it app which was yummy and could be a meal in itself. 
Our waiter Graham was very helpful and efficient, as well as friendly. 
I had the Morty's steakhouse burger which was cooked perfectly (medium) and had great flavor.
My husband had the elk on the range. He said it was very tasty, but unexpectedly spicy, but that was because he didn't read the menu properly.  The patty is dusted in Diablo powder. 
I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Nice spot for a wide variety of tasty burgers.  Had some burgers and shakes here and both were very good.  The 50/50 burger with the peppercorn crust was very good...nice heat and texture to the patty.  I will say the rosemary olive oil bun was dry as can be, but everything else was great.  The shakes were excellent as well (although how do you mess up a shake?).  Service was friendly if a bit slow.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Well I have been past this location in Fox chapel and have been at the consol energy center and the burgers always looked great.
So after some time downtown we decided to try it on the way home.
Man are we glad we did!!!!
The burgers were done perfectly.
My one son had the classic and I had the Meat your maker and WOW!!!!,the flavor of the beef and the condiments were on point for the win!
Also had the the Fork It and the rib meat and gravy and curds was also spot on!
Finished it off with a trio of milkshakes!
We will be back!
Best burgers in the Burgh!"}
{"text":"So I've been having a craving for a milkshake and I was referred to try out this restaurant.  The food was phenomenal.  I like the ability to create my own burger and the variety of milkshakes.  This star rating is more about the setup.  I don't like how close the tables are and that customers who are waiting are hovering over you while you're trying to eat.  There's no real sense of comfort. I felt claustrophobic.  I will say the service was great.  The bartenders,  waiters, and hosts were cordial.  The atmosphere is welcoming, but the seating arrangements should be looked at."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy Burgatory, unfortunately as of late they have been slacking. Slacking to the point where I will not go back. They mess up the take out orders quite often now, especially when it comes to getting the correct side, and not to mention they are usually lukewarm or cold. The last experience I had in the restaurant was easily the worst. The waiter barely paid attention to our table, and that was problematic because my vegan burger was completely burnt. It was blackened on both sides. By the time they were able to redo the burger, everyone at my table was finished. I ate part of the burger and tried the get a box for the salad I paid extra for, since I was the only one left eating, and after getting a hold of the waiter and asking for a box, he never came back to the table. He walked past our table several times tending to other tables, but I couldn't grab his attention. I left infuriated, without my salad and the leftover food I had just paid for.

I've also noticed they tend not to pay attention to you if it's just two people at the table and the servers tend not to know exactly what's in your food--something important when I order vegan friendly food. The bean side wasn't labeled that it contained meat, and the waitress (whom I told I was vegan) happily served me the beans. It wasn't until I dug in that I realized there was bacon in the beans--probably the furthest thing from vegan friendly."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that this place is better than B Spot! Large, substantial burger on a soft delicious brioche bun (other options available). Kids had home made ice cream and a coke float; the ice cream was excellent. Chips are good but not as great as fries. Overall an outstanding burger experience."}
{"text":"I love Burgatory.

I mainly love Burgatory because they make TRUFFLE GORGONZOLA FRIES!!!!!! Truffle Fries. Truffle Fries with delicious cheese. ohmahgawd. My mouth is watering as I write this. 

Their fries are probably my favorite fries EVER. I typically come for happy hour when the fries are half off, but if I order a burger I get chips AND add an order of truffle gorgonzola fries. FYI: The chips and fries reheat well in the toaster oven/oven, so if you need to get both you can finish them during your next meal. 

Happy hour at Burgatory is pretty good and includes half off apps, some $5 cocktails, and (I think) $2 off drafts (but I can't entirely remember and can't find a menu/info about it ANYWHERE.)

I've also had different versions of the veggie burger and the crab patty. Every burger/sandwich thing has been good. And the milkshakes..... The milkshakes, spiked or otherwise, deserve their spot on so many different \"Best Milkshake\" lists. My favorite is the Salted Nutella Crunch with some kind of alcohol added. 

The reasons my review isn't five stars? The wait time can be insane if you don't put yourself on the reservation/waitlist and some of the other apps I've had have not been good. I've brought people to Burgatory before and everyone has agreed that the truffle fries are magnificent, but some have been disappointed with some of the other starters we shared."}
{"text":"After flying all day, I just wanted a beer and a burger. 
Well, I went here and I understand that it was 30 minutes until closing. The bartender was a surly and stupid hipster. She told me \"fill this paper out so we don't mess up your burger\" OK? I thought.
She asked me, how do you want it cooked. I said medium.
The burger was just average, it was cooked medium rare. I was just so tired. 
I left disappointed. I don't think I will be back. $7.00 beers???? No way!!"}
{"text":"Great location.. Great place to grab something to eat before a Pirates game if you're parking on the North Shore.. I always get the create your own burger which is great.. Service was good as well and seating outside is nice even when you're trying to beat the heat the umbrellas cover everything well.. Server as well as hostess were attentive and waitress explained the menu very throughly"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was fun. When we went we customized our burgers.  I liked that they had check off lists to fill out and give to the waitress.  

The milkshakes are out of this world!  They had a special one that was like strawberry pretzel dessert. It tasted just like it.  I had the carmel pretzel one. It was so good!

If you go here and like bacon then get the Fiddy Fiddy hamburger. It's ground bacon and hamburg together!  So good!

Price was about what I was expecting it to be.  Definitely worth it.  Would go back there in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Burgers.  Great!!  Those chips they serve not as much.  Our portion  unedible  greasy thru and thru. And mentioned to server  she sent manager over. Very nice guy brought us a fresh order and they were not much better.  The server also mixed up the placement of the burger on the table and we had no idea til half way thru when my mom commented the burger was spicy. 
Had the Monty. Great burger nice portion. My niece had the buffalo and the taste was great.  Would be a 4 but for $12 burger the whole meal should be good."}
{"text":"OK, Burgatory completely cheated in stealing a 5 star review.

They knew I love Burnt Almond Torte (so much we had one as our wedding cake).  They knew, that if they could manage to spin it into an addictively good milkshake with vanilla vodka and amaretto, that I'd likely be hooked... and they were right.

Add this to an Elk burger that was ACTUALLY JUICY (not a dried out brick like a lot of other places serve) and well done sweet potato chips, and you have for one awesome gut bomb of a meal (be ready to take a nap after this one).

I had reservations after having a Burgatory burger that left a lot to desire from their Consol Energy Center location, but I was honest with myself that it wasn't likely a good representation of the real deal...  I was correct as well.

I'm not exactly sure what my favorite burger in the burgh is now...  but it's definitely a tie between here or Winghart's!"}
{"text":"My family, husband and I all went to Burgatory for a late lunch/early dinner on the weekend. We had one mission: the Impossible Burger (the family is Omni, hubby & I are vegan.)! 
Our waiter was phenomenal. When told that we were all getting the Impossible Burger, he got so psyched! On top of that, he was very knowledgeable on cross contamination (with the chips) and the vegan alternatives available. He was also superb at recommending beers to my father & gramma! 
The food was great. Really. The burger was cooked perfectly, there were vegan condiments and the sides were awesome. Oh - and the vegan milkshakes with alcohol. To die for.
Thanks Burgatory for adding another vegan option to your menu! Keep on keeping on with those plant based goodies!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  As a vegetarian, I've only had a couple of items on the menu:  the veggie burger and the portabello mushroom sandwich and both were excellent.  The latter comes with a side salad of mixed greens including arugula and roasted tomatoes with a really intense flavor that are to die for.  The portabello sandwich is very nicely seasoned and grilled and comes on a foccacia bun so you can't hate that.
We shared a milkshake -- it was big enough for two but I probably could have had one to myself -- that was sweet and salty as it had crushed up pretzels in it -- very tasty indeed.
It is the new \"hip\" place in Waterworks so there is usually a line but they will take your cell phone number and send you a text when your table is ready.  They usually over-estimate the wait by a significant amount (we've never had to wait nearly as long as they said.)
A warning about the chairs at the tables and the flat tops:  I found them to be extremely uncomfortable.  Try to get a booth, if you can."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were  in town from Fort Lauderdale and we love Burgers and try to find a place in ever city to eat one. We read the reviews and decided on this place. We both asked for medium and out waitress warned us it would be a little pink inside which is exactly how we like it. It was well done to the max. My cousins said they are known more for the bar."}
{"text":"I just stopped at the Burgertory in the Waterfront for the first time today. I didn't know what to expect but loved what I got. First I had a seat near a window. Since it was a beautiful day the window was open so it was warm with a nice breeze so A for atmosphere. I got the Fork it as an appetizer and have to say I really really really want more. The I had the crab shack for lunch. Absolutely loved it. My waiter was a young man named Brian and with it being my first time there he explained the menu and actually suggested the Fork it. All in all I will be going back and will bring friends and family."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out on a whim.  Well this place did not disappoint.  I decided on the build your own burger and it was pretty much the best burger I have ever had.  My DH had the Piggy PB and J.  This too was amazing.  We will definitely be back.  And I won't even mind the 1.5 he drive."}
{"text":"Loved the real food menu.  Very fresh produce. Freshly made chips with great flavor. The menu and decor are witty and engaging."}
{"text":"After several months I recently came back here while working in the area. It was a Thursday evening and pretty busy, but we were seated almost immediately. Our server Larissa was super friendly and patient with us. She checked in a few times during the meal but was never intrusive. Service was also quick.

I got the wagyu burger with pink, with angel dust rub, grilled pineapple, bacon jam, cucumbers, and roasted red peppers without a bun. Since I got so many toppings I was glad I went bunless and could just eat the burger like a steak. I also got a side of jalapeño cornbread. I'm usually pretty sensitive to spicy food, but I didn't find the cornbread spicy at all. It's possible that my burger was flavorful enough to overpower the cornbread, however.

The ladies' room is small, with just 2 stalls, but I didn't have to wait when I needed to go. There is a pretty cool outdoor-ish seating area that's covered with a tent and heated with lanterns; it was super cold the day I came here but with the lanterns, the seating area was perfectly warm.

Great burger place; I'm glad I got to come back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding burgers and fantastic shakes. The creative burger combinations are surpassed only by the build your own burger. The unique shakes are both tasty and memorable."}
{"text":"Best vegan burger I've ever had ever ever ever. And the other burgers have never gotten a less-than-awesome review from my dining buddies.

And their shakes? Holy crap, also the best ever. Vegan shakes on Tuesdays are always bomb, but they'll usually make you a chocolate or vanilla vegan shake if you request one on other days of the week.

Just make sure you're okay waiting...Any day of the week, I've never waited less than 45 minutes to be seated. But there are lots of stores nearby while you wait for your Burgatory text!"}
{"text":"Really great food and service. I had a Custom Creation with chicken and the chicken was legit chicken - not rubbery like you get at most places.  Our waiter was polite and attentive.  Honestly, the only thing I was underwhelmed by were the fries, and I think that's more of a personal opinion.  I think Burgatory is a great option for when you have a group of people and every one wants something a little different.  I'm all for the make your own!"}
{"text":"Slow service, limited menu even for a burger place. I prefer the OTHR burger restaurant as they have a better selection as well as better service."}
{"text":"After being recommended this place by my friend and hearing so many good things I decided to finally visit Burgatory.

I had read that there was an app called No Wait that helps you get into their computerized queue without actually being there so it would help you with not having to wait at the actual restaurant in person.  They set it up as a text when your table is ready.  Unfortunately I didn't get the app to work with my phone probably because my phone number is from Canada.  Perhaps their system doesn't allow texts that are outside the US?

This is a gourmet burger place that offers choices.  There is a even a choice of shakes both alcoholic and non alcoholic.  While the menu has ready made choices of burgers they do give the option to build your own creation.  That to me is absolutely intriguing!

When creating your own burger there is a pad of paper where the condiments are on the side along with pencils to fill in your choices.

Your choices are for choice of burger (meats) from beef, chicken, bison, crab, wagyu beef, elk or veggie.  You pick a bun type, dry rubs, cheese, sauces, and a very wide variety of toppings.  Depending on the extras you would like there are extra charges but the variety of choices leave you with so many possibilities.  Building your own burger is cool but having the quantity of choices they have to choose from makes it truly a customized experience.

We had started with starter of Gorgonzola fries and they were really good. 

I ended up going with the bison on a brioche with bbq rub, Amish Gorgonzola, roasted garlic mayo, applewood smoked bacon, banana peppers, and arugula.

My wife had ordered the aged wagyu on a baguette with kona crust rub (coffee and chocolate), horseradish cheddar, roast garlic mayo, and guacamole.

If I could change something I would change the fact that the burgers come with chips.  It is a mix of yellow and sweet potato chips.  If the chips were say fried fresh that would be different.  They seem like they are just from a bag and ready made.  It would be a better experience if they came with fries that you could upgrade like what we ordered prior instead if you wanted to or just plain fries on the side.  I wasn't really a fan of the chips but the burgers and fries were really good.

I liked the ambiance, the drinks and the fun involved in making the choice to build our own burgers.  The burgers were very good and although it's costs more than say a Five Guys this is an experience not just a place to get full.  The ingredients and variety of choices to choose from are NOT something you will see at just about any other chain burger place whether upscale/gourmet or not.  This place really does give you something different and judging on how busy the place is... they seem to be doing something right.

I would definitely return to Burgatory.  This is a Pittsburgh success as far as I am concerned.  Well done!"}
{"text":"So happy they finally opened this one, because I live so close to the Waterfront, and I love Burgatory. They let you build your own burger by filling out an order form, so it's easy to get things just the way you like it. They have a lot of \"burger\" options including elk, bison, wagyu, veggie, and crab burgers. I LOVE the veggie burger, which tastes a little like stovetop stuffing to me, but in a way that totally works. The burgers are always done right, and everything else on the menu was delicious. One of our lamer companions ordered a salad and it was very well done. The Gorgonzola and truffle aioli fries are TO DIE FOR. The shakes are also delicious. Know that you can order any of them with or without the booze, despite how they are listed on the menu. 

Downsides: While the standard burger prices are pretty affordable, the extras on a custom burger can add up quickly, especially if you start off by opting for a different kind of meat. They only have three temperature options (red, pink, well-done), instead of the traditional 5, which I think is pretty unacceptable at a burger joint. The shakes and beer take \"expensive\" to a new level. You can't get a beer on tap for less than $6, and craft brews will set you back $8-$9. Shakes with alcohol cost even more. 

All Burgatory locations--including this newest one--are pretty small, and because of its popularity, you're in for a wait on weekends. Worse than that, the kitchen doesn't seem to be able to keep up with this place. Both times I came here we waited a long time after ordering our food. Maybe this will smooth out over time, because I have not had this problem at other Burgatory locations. Overall, I highly recommend this place, as long as you are prepared to wait and keep track of what you order so the check doesn't come as a surprise."}
{"text":"Seriously, it does NOT get better than this.  Best burgers in the burgh for sure - there is no doubt that someone sold their soul for burgers this good (which is, I guess, the whole point).  We had the Bangkok Steak Fries as an appetizer and wow, I could eat those all day long.  We made our own burgers which were PHENOMENAL, and in the end, the price was pretty reasonable.  I think we were in the $35-40 range between the two of us, and we got the appetizers, fountain drinks, and burgers with lots of extras.  Can't wait to go back and try another one.  

Oh yeah, and they just text you when your table is ready so you can go out and go shopping, and not even worry about sitting there waiting for a table (which is good, because when we were there, the place was hoppin'!)  There's a TJ Maxx and Barnes and Noble nextdoor so lots to do while you wait."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night. it was great. he had the farmhouse burger and I had the Steakhouse burger. They had fresh squeezed lemonade and let me have all the pickles I wanted. I just wish there had been room for a milkshake.  A little pricey but I would go back for the great service."}
{"text":"I eat very little beef, so a burger restaurant is not the first place I think of for lunch or dinner. Now I wish I had discovered Burgatory earlier, as there is so much more than beef on this menu. We stopped by on a Sunday night and found them very busy, so we nabbed the last two remaining barstools and avoided the half hour wait. According to the very helpful bar staff, this is usual for Sunday night at this location...they let us know it's their busiest night of the week, so heads up on that. The woman who waited on us was great at helping us to decipher the menu. She explained everything clearly and was quick to point our some of her favorites. I like that you can put your own meal together from the list provided...my husband took advantage of that fun feature to create his own masterpiece. I went with a regular menu burger that sounded great; the Elk Gone Wild, which is an elk burger \"Diablo dusted\" and topped with gouda, caramelized onion marmalade, bacon jam and tomato vinaigrette tossed arugula. I opted to get mine sans the bun and switched to a side salad for a $1.50 upgrade. This burger was delicious, with more than just a hint of spice from the Diablo dust, a nice sweetness from the caramelized onion marmalade and a little bit of smokiness from the bacon jam. I had asked for some of the tomato vinaigrette to go with my side salad, and the dressing was terrific. The side salad was also very substantial, with some pumpkin seeds, parmesan cheese and oven roasted tomatoes finishing it off. Overall a very delicious and, dare I say, nutritious meal. I was happy to discover that one can eat a  healthy, well balanced meal at this restaurant...or you can go for one of their shakes and really indulge. Next time I may try a salad, or even the veggie burger, as they also sounded really good. Good food thoughtfully prepared, excellent service and, if you sit at the bar, a great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"It was good, but it certainly wasn't amazing. I got the Wrath burger. The store was practically empty and we got our food pretty quickly, although it was a little cold. The burger was tasty but there wasn't anything special about it. Although I will say the bun was super soft, and the bacon was really thick and soft as well - if you're a fan of crispy bacon you may not like it. 

We also had got the garlic parmesan fries. Again, there wasn't anything super special about them. They weren't super garlicky. My bf got the Sloth burger and he really liked it, although he likes everything and hence his opinion can't be trusted."}
{"text":"Staying at nearby hotel, walked over based on Yelp reviews. Had an onion ring app, didn't care for it, was VERY greasy. Sauces were good. Ordered steakhouse burger, which was solid but unremarkable - I've gotten onion straws on plenty of burgers before. Sauce was unremarkable, chips were fresh but unseasoned. It was okay...but 25 bucks is a lot to pay for an okay burger, onion rings and a diet coke. Could have done as well at a number of places for half the price. Wait staff was excellent."}
{"text":"Great place get a tasty shake and burger. The strawberry funnel cake shake is so yummy as well as the s'mores shake. What's nice is you can create your own burger or select one from the menu. Onion rings were delicious as well. Make sure to bring a jacket as it's always cold in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has great burgers and friendly staff. I enjoy a wide variety of burgers on their menu that you typically don't get elsewhere. Great ambience, too!"}
{"text":"The vegetarian impossible burger taste so real even my cat was fooled and loved it !!! This place is amazing !"}
{"text":"The food is always good, but I think the beer selection is a little pricey for the typically unimpressive selection. My boyfriend and I always sit at the bar and I find that the bartenders are typically more interested in talking to their co-workers/friends than servicing their guests. But the food will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Woah woah woah! The vegan Impossible Burger is simply amazing. So good. I also had a strawberry vegan milkshake and it made me so happy!"}
{"text":"WOW!! I just had the vegan impossible burger and it was to perfection. The had homemade chips that were the perfect texture. You know how homemade chips can be stale after an hour? I left these in the take home box for several hours and they were as good as when I ordered them. Get this. They even had vegan milkshakes!!"}
{"text":"Very nice burger place near the highway. Had a wagyu beef burger for only $15. The corn bread was really good as well and the potato salad had an interesting freshness to it that made us think of a hike in a rainy forest"}
{"text":"Just flew into Pittsburgh and it was past dinner time. I brought the whole family for burgers and shakes. This place never disappoints in my opinion. 

We started with the Fork It fries, pork and cheese. It's the epitome of comfort food. We all grabbed delicious milkshakes (try the salted caramel pretzel)!

I created my own burger. They have a menu just for this purpose. You check every ingredient you'd like on your sandwich and they bring you a custom creation. I checked almost everything, LOL.

I've been here a few times and will always come back. It's worth the stop in for anyone local or traveling."}
{"text":"I wont say I didnt enjoy my burger. But it was just ok.. I felt I paid extra for a good burger for nothing. And this review reflects what I like in a burger. While you get a very big and thick burger. I dont think it was cook properly. Myself it should be juicy..  this burger lack this. and the outside of the has that crisp burnt effect becuase a burger this thick it has to have this. And I just like that in a burger. Why I prefer to goto five guys.. they give you two thin pattys that are super juicy and the juicys run down your hand. So I prefer this style... However my wiffe prefers burgatory becuase she likes that burnt shell.."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Burgatory, and being a fan of the American Burger I thought I'd give this small Pittsburgh chain a try. On our visit we tried the Piggy Butter and Jelly Burger as well as the Classic Cheese Burger. Both were amazingly amazingly tasty! These Burgers are all the hype, and left me wanting more for sure. They have a distinct way of matching condiments with the meat that you might never really try at home, but they make it work like none-other! By all means treat yourself to a Burgatory Burger as soon as you get the chance. Your taste buds will thank you later!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and shakes and I love the truffle fries.  The only thing holding it back from 5 stars is the ketchup - definitely not Heinz.  It tasted like some sort of off-brand generic which detracted from my overall meal."}
{"text":"Went here about 4:45 on a Monday before movie. The place was empty. Ordered an order of onion rings as an app, and my companion and I each customized a burger. She also ordered a caramel pretzel shake. The rings were pretty great, bit otherwise tasty. Came with a horseradish sauce and ketchup. One complaint I consistently have with Burgatory - why do they ask how you want your burger cooked if they're not going to execute? Ordered pink, as I usually do. Often it'll come out like jerky. This time or was mooing on the way out. Red mush. Not good . Seems to be a total crapshoot - train your chefs to a standard and keep it! My friend seemed to like her wagyu burger, though had the same \"just off the hoof\" doneness. And she liked her shake. And our server was very nice and serviceable. 

Think they may be expanding too fast - get your house in order before growing further."}
{"text":"The food is good but you also are creating your own burger so unless the ingredients are bad it's pretty much your own fault. The brisket tacos were really delicious! Service was so so as the bartender seemed to be more interested in his phone then talking to guests... I'd go back again,, it's new and working out the kinks I assume."}
{"text":"It's not a terribly difficult concept, just burgers and some few other options with quality sides and tasty boozey milkshakes. Burgers are a favourite food for me so I liked this place and have gone many times, never having a bad experience. The service has always been quick and attentive and when I order a burger rare, it actually comes out rare (this is more uncommon than you'd think and I am happy if I get a medium-rare burger when I order rare).

One thing I wish they'd add to the menu is a spicy burger, I know they have one burger with a bit of peppers but it really isn't spicy. For me a kick-in-the-ass burger would be a welcome addition to the menu."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Sorry I know you folks live and die by this place but its really over rated in my personal opinion. I was so disappointed. It wasn't nasty but it darn sure wasn't AWESOME! I was really excited to finally have the chance to eat there. We were all excited. The décor was really cool. The bacon burger was not seasoned and the bacon was rubbery. They forgot my onions. I love pretzel buns but didn't like the pretzel bun there. Like I said it wasn't the worst burger I ever had....but it was pretty bland. We should have went over to 5 Guys next door. Maybe it was just that particular location in Robinson."}
{"text":"Yum! I love any place that encourages total customization. Here you can have any burger you can think of. Choose your bun, meat, condiments, accessories, and side dish. Anything you want. With that said, we ordered off the menu. 

Seeing how it was my birthday I ordered a cocktail, Strawberry Basil Shag, delicious and refreshing with chunks of strawberries and big basil leafs. I wish I could have a pitcher of that. Fork It for the appetizer, fries were a nod to traditional poutine. Loaded with shredded pork, gravy, and a few cheese curds, I would have loved more cheese. My burger of choice was the Piggy Butter and Jelly, spicy and sweet and juicy. On paper it's an odd combination, in my mouth perfection. I chose to substitute the chips for the slaw which was a great idea. The slaw was cool and creamy and perfectly cut and seasoned. It balanced the spicy burger awesomely. My date had the Trippin Chicken, which he devoured, with a side of quinoa salad. The quinoa was light and fresh compared to all the other items. 

I could go back here again and again and never be bored with the menu. Service was good, atmosphere cool, good tunes playing and sports on the tv. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Really big heavy burgers for $11+. I guess I'd give their milkshakes 4 stars, and their burgers 3.

My friend and I usually split a burger and shake and were totally stuffed after. Good general place to meet up, but not a destination eatery."}
{"text":"Food was fine but service was not bad, everyone was very inattentive. Host stand was clearly entirely disinterested, at best. Server was nice enough, but rarely came back, and we waited so long for second round of drinks that we literally just went to the bar on our own to get them during our meal. When runners brought food they waited for us to move our used appetizer dishes so they could put down food, but then never took the dishes. Our table was so crowded we had to stack our dirty dishes and glasses on the floor to make room to eat our dinner.   Will not visit this location again."}
{"text":"Loved this place! So many burger options and made really well. I wanted to try something different so I made my own elk burger and it was fantastic. I really like that you can customize burgers here as well as going with their own options. Gives lots of variety and will satisfy anyone! I can't wait to come again and try a milkshake too"}
{"text":"Great burgers, a lot of choices. I have family of 6 ranging from teenagers all the way to 4 yrs; they all loved it."}
{"text":"4.5 stars! This place is super awesome and I was glad I decided to check this place out on my last night during my recent Pittsburgh trip. The place was slightly further away from Shadyside but it's worth a dive. It's located a mall area, so the good part is, you can always find a parking spot! I love that they serve high quality of both milkshakes (they even have spiked options if you want some alcohols in them!) and burgers and their atmosphere and service were both superb. Both my SO and I REALLY enjoyed our meals and experiences there there.

My SO ordered a Caramel Pretzel shake and I ordered the Salted Nutella Crunch shake ($6 ea). I actually tried my SO shake, in addition to finishing my own, so I can attest to the fact that you can't go wrong with any choices you made! I felt like the flavors that they offered are interesting and were so well balanced that no matter what you choose, you simply are just going to enjoy them anyways. I also appreciate that they bring the extra portion that they couldn't fill into your milkshake glass for you to finish, too! :D~~~ I was happy that they didn't throw that away...because that would be such a waste!

I ordered the Piggy Butter Jelly burger because I thought their ingredients (like candied bacon and habanero jam) sounded interesting. I  was pleasantly surprised how well they went together. I forgot what my SO had, but ...at the end..we both finished our meals completely as well. I think that showed how well we loved our meals here.

Another thing to like is that the atmosphere of this place was great. It had a good energy, lively vibe to it. We stopped by this place around 9pm and it was still crowded! The service was great, too. The waitress brought out one wrong ingredient in the burger for the table next to us. When the customer informed the waittress about the mistake, she graciously took the comment, promptly apologized...and within the next few minutes, the restaurant manager came out with the correct ingredient/new burger to personally apologize to the table! :) So, yea, I was impressed. I get it that mistakes can be made..but how they handled it..was really professional! :)

Next time I'm in Pittsburgh or if anyone asks for recommendation for a good, fun or for a burger place, Burgatory would be my answer!"}
{"text":"Burgers do not get better than those made at Burgatory!! I could eat their burgers for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and not to forget their stomach filling milkshakes. Their catch line is perfect: \"Heavenly Shakes and Helluva Burger.\" 

There is usually a line to get in during lunch and dinner time (good idea to go online and check their wait times) and they do not take reservations, but once you are in, you will not complain and the food is well worth the wait. You can also drop by and leave your name with the hostess and once a seat opens up, they will text you and give you 10 mins or so to show up.

I have tried the \"Meat Your Maker\" and the \"Morty's Steakhouse.\" While both are great, I prefer making my own burger with just the right stuff I need.

My preferences for a perfect burger:

Hormone Free Beef is better than Dry Aged Wagyu (not tried any other meat here - the beef patty is soft, melt in your mouth goodness - I prefer mine cooked medium)
Can't go wrong with a Brioche bun
Angel Dust, Kona Crust, Kingston Jerk, Cracked Peppercorn (all taste perfect)
Smoked Gouda, Horseradish Cheddar, Aged Gruyere
Roasted Garlic Mayo, Truffled Shallot Aioli
Bacon, Jalapenos (my favorite add-ons)

The house sweet-potato fries are good, they are just an extra for me.... The Salted Nutella Crunch and the Caramel Pretzel Shakes are great (and definitely sharable unless you have a serious appetite and the capacity for a zillion calories).

If you have not yet tried Burgatory, you need to ASAP."}
{"text":"Landed here for dinner after a long drive. Service was great. Beer was ok. Burgers and fries were cold. Server brought us a new basket of hot fries so kudos to Wende!  Elk burger was devoid of seasoning. Fish sandwich was a huge hunk of bread with fish. Should have paid attention to the broken sign outside. That usually means the place is slipping. Wouldn't want to stop here again when there's a five guys right next door."}
{"text":"Made my second visit to this burger place yesterday. I had to return because since my last visit to Pittsburgh area, every burger I have eaten has been compared to Burgatory yumminess. There are so many options that no matter what you crave, you can have it! I am a bit of a purist....I minimize toppings and this is terrific because the meat here is up to the challenge. Service is attentive and friendly. Be aware that there are extra charges for add-ons to your sandwich, but I consider it worth every cent!"}
{"text":"This is not the place to experience the great burgers found at other Burgatory locations.  The burgers are pre-prepared so the burgers we got were actually cold and dry and the chips were not crisp.  The price we paid for cold food was outrageous.   Eat at some other stadium food place and save your Burgatory experience for one of their stand alone locations."}
{"text":"Was in the greater Pittsburgh area for a short time and had time for a quick lunch.  I like to pick an establishment that I can't find near home.  Passed by Burgatory and though it looked interesting.

My wife and I go in (my wife doesn't eat red meat, so I was thinking I would leave with troubles), but we both really enjoyed our lunches.  She couldn't decide between the Psychedelic 'Shroom \"burger\" and the Crab Shack \"burger\".  We decided to order both and share.  We were quite impressed.  We both agreed the Crab would taste better on a different bread selection.  On the menu, it comes on a regular roll.  I would try a different option next time.  The Schroom burger was extremely flavorful and put together well.

We both left happy and were glad we made a new discovery!"}
{"text":"We were all in the mood for a good burger so we decided to check out Burgatory. The atmosphere has a modern vibe with a little devilish theme. The staff is friendly and accommodating. They have a great menu of all natural, hormone free burgers. If your not feeling their signature burgers you can always build your own. I love the option of burgers from wagyu, crab, elk, bison, veggie and even a fifty fifty bacon/beef burger. And don't forget the handcrafted milkshakes to go with your burger. 

We started with their fork it fries (fresh cut fries, short ribs, cheddar cheese curds and pan gravy). Boy was I in heaven. The fries stayed crispy and the short rib was melt in your mouth. Amazing! We all decided to build our burgers. While everyone chose beef and absolutly loved their burgers, I chose the elk burger and man was it delicious. The burger was cooked perfectly and it had the perfect burger to bun ratio and the brioche bun held up perfectly. This place is definitely worth a trip back. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  Custom built wild crab burgers - excellent; daughter tried the bbq wings highly recommended she's a true wing expert; shakes ordered - Apple pie special, cookie monster, campfire s'mores, salted nutella crunch - all equally great as the next. Definitely worth a stop when in the area"}
{"text":"Food is consistent. The Impossible burger is really a nice surprise. We asked for the ingredients list. It was a bit challenging to find it, but we got it and we were quiet impressed. We usually like to make our own burgers. That's a fun option. The milk shakes are fantastic... But getting them everytime might be too much!
I have to include the fact that the atmosphere is loud!! We actually asked for the music to be turned down. We were told it if set by the owners, not management. That was weird. Had to hear each other while waiting for our table.. We didn't want to ask about that after the music thing. Our food came out quickly and hot. 
 It was also really cold. So bring a jacket
I'm going to stop typing now.... My fingers a numb."}
{"text":"I went into this place at the recommendation of the lady at the front desk at the hotel...build your own burger...what could be better than that?? Well apparently a lot of things because let me tell you it was disappointing to say the least. I chose to build my own burger and they forgot one of the toppings I requested...they offered to make it right away but why should I have to wait an additional amount of time...then the toppings were very sparing...there was like 5 pieces of the grilled onions, two of spinach....so sad..the burger was cooked well which is nice...the brioche bun must not be their most popular because it was losing its crust which is a good indication that it was going stale...the house made chips were burnt and therefore bitter...all in all a sad trip to what could have been a cool place."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh this week for work, and decided to stop by Burgatory for dinner. Menu has hearty, comfort food inspired dishes. 

If you're feeling up for the challenge, you can actually build your own burger/sandwich using checklists at the table. We split the \"fork em\" to start which was over the top good, and then wrapped up dinner with a \"meat your maker\". 

Good service, great food, and fun crowd. Would definitely stop by again next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Food - 10 stars. Service - NEGATIVE ONE MILLION stars.

The short version is, I probably won't return to this Burgatory location again. I'll stick to the Waterworks, where they have customer service in spades.  

I don't care for bullet points in lieu of narrative, but the longer version goes a little something like this:

* Our party of 9 visited Burgatory this past Saturday for what was to be a celebratory pre-show birthday dinner before a 7pm show at The Improv.

* The birthday girl and beau arrived at 4:30pm (per Burgatory's recommendation) to put our name on the list. 

* We were seated at approximately 6pm - not totally out of the realm of understanding, given that we were at a restaurant on a Saturday night that doesn't accept reservations.

* Our server wasn't rude, but I wouldn't call her \"nice\" either.  We gently mentioned to her that we were attempting to make a 7pm show and she said that wouldn't be a problem.

* It was a problem.

* We were approached once about drinks and had to seek her out to request a second round.  We would've had more given the opportunity.

* Seven of the nine of us received our food at 6:50pm.  The remaining two were told that their food was on its way.  It wasn't...anytime soon.

* It wasn't until a manager approached the table to apologize for the \"mistake\" that we even realized a mistake had been made. The server made no reference to this whatsoever.  The manager offered a complimentary side dish to each of the affected, which was appreciated.

* When our food finally arrived, it was INCREDIBLE. Many, many kudos to the culinary team for a series of meaty flavor explosions heard 'round the table and possibly, around the entire Waterfront.

* To recap - The server was nearly non-existent. Though she verbally recognized our request to complete dinner by 7pm she ignored it when it mattered, and never once apologized for the food issues or lack of attention to our timeframe.  I don't like her.

* The manager comped the burgers of the two who didn't receive their food with the rest of us. That's appreciated, but a bit too little, a bit too late.

* I'm sad."}
{"text":"Who has two thumbs and orders a portabello sandwich at a burger joint?  THIS guy.

I can't believe it's taken me this long to visit Burgatory.  Everyone is right - it's AWESOME!  Our service was great; nice beer selection; and I'm a big fan of the menu: creative burger choices and other great options for us not-so-burger-lovin' people.  And the shakes? They require a three syllable da-a-amn.  I didn't have one to myself, but took a sip/spoonful of my date's Pittsburgh Strawberry Pretzel Salad shake and it was deeeelicious.  My sandwich was a juicy compilation of mushroom and melt-in-your-mouth gouda complemented with a really nice batch of seasoned (what IS that seasoning - I can't quite figure it out) fresh french fries.  

The only sad part of my visit was that I neglected to take the red plastic pitch fork that held my sandwich together with me when I left.  

I can't wait to go back and eat a piece of everything on that entire menu!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger & milkshake joint! If you've never been to a Burgatory before, here is what to expect:
1. Choose your own bun. Brioche, Focaccia bread (my recommendation), gluten free, topless, naked, pretzel bun and more. 
2. Choose your meat. It's hormone and antibiotic free, so you don't have all the guilt. Beef, bison, crab, chicken, elk, veggie - an option for everyone. You get to pick your flavoring for it as well. They also have a variety of spreads. 
3. Downfall - they charge you for cheese, but they have cheeses I've never even heard of. They also charge you for a lot of toppings, minus some basics (tomato, lettuce, pickles).  
4. ALCOHOLIC. MILKSHAKES. Yes, you can get a shot of just about anything in their milkshakes, or any of the milkshakes without. The Burnt Almond Torte is fantastic. 
Unfortunately, this location tends to run out of their \"shake of the week\" fairly quickly. 2 or 3 times I've gone in for their specialty shake, and they were out. 

The cornbread is fantastic. The homemade chips are meh. I usually opt out for a different side (chips are free, others are extra), they remind me of overcooked kettle chips. Downfall: NO FRENCH FRIES. 

Overall, this place has a little something for everyone from your heaviest carnivores to your oh-so-vegan friends.

UPDATE: they now DO have French fries and they are amazing, they also no longer carry the focaccia bread."}
{"text":"These burgers are amazing.

My favorite burger is the meat your maker burger!
The fries are pretty great too.

We tried the Nutella milkshake and the salted caramel milk shake. five star rating!

The price is the only thing that holds this place back.
For two people expect to spend $50-60 at a burger joint."}
{"text":"I'm torn - when it's on it's the best burger in Pittsburgh, but they mess up often.

When I come here, it's usually a big trek with friends. The wait can get long...but lately, its been under an hour, even for big groups.

I think the Wagyu burger is the best in Pittsburgh - and I've searched far and wide for the best. The meat has a nice, deep flavor to it, and I get to pick my own toppings (I usually get something similar to the \"Meat your Maker\", keeping it simple).

However, nearly every the time I've been there with more than 4 people, someones burger got messed up. They forget toppings, or switch part of the toppings of two peoples burgers, or another I-can't-understand-how-this-happened error. To their credit, they usually remake it and give us the burger for free...but we end up waiting a while. Once, they even had to remake the burger twice! On top of that, when the group is big, the burgers usually end up overcooked.

So go and enjoy a fantastic burger...but keep the groups small.

Pro-tips:
Pay a little extra for the jalapeño corn bread. Comes with a slightly sweetened vanilla butter - so good!
Don't order your shake before your burger!! Sweets make bad appetizers, but great desserts."}
{"text":"I will start this by saying we did not get a burger, but what we did get wasn't note worthy. We split some sriracha wings...talk about menu mislabeling.  This wings had no kick!!! When I want sriracha I want heat and fire. The wings tasted more like a ketchup sauce and were not good at all.  They weren't even worth finishing and I love chicken wings.  My boyfriend got a caramel pretzel shake that was good."}
{"text":"Love the food but the music is so loud for a Saturday afternoon!!!!!  And not enough basil in the shag."}
{"text":"Went here today, first time in the city. I tried the impossible burger which is completely plant based. I am a vegan by no means, but I am curious and tend to delve into veg/vegan food to expand my palette. The burger was incredible! I got it with some of the diablo dust seasoning and wow! I would eat that over any meat based burger any day! However, not all blue skies! THE PARKING SITUATION IS TERRIBLE! But thats all. Give that impossible burger a go!"}
{"text":"So many great things about this place. The food and staff are both some of the best around. They did leave my girl's burger pink, but compt her burger after fixing it. We're coming back."}
{"text":"As high end burger chains go, Burgatory is among the best.

The utilitarian garage like space creates a wide open sense with the exposed HVAC making for an industrial feel.  There is a square bar for drinking and eating, as well as many tables throughout that accommodate a large crowd.  There are large HDTVs all around, but they are set on mute as the acoustics in this shop were poor already due to all the hard surfaces.  Even the table tops were metal. 

The burgers and shakes are top notch.  I ordered the Mort's Steakhouse Burger (medium) and a Salted Caramel Pretzel Shake.  Oh, my!!!!  The drink arrived in a tall glass topped off with whipped cream and a mini pretzel.  That was big enough, but alongside was the aluminum mixing container that was still half full.  It was deliciously sweet and creamy with the salted caramel playing hide and seek with the sweet cream.  I took half of it home.  

The Steakhouse chopped beef was a half pound of nicely seared and still pink-centered joy.  It tasted as if it had never been frozen and absorbed the essence of the Grilled Onions, Onion Straws, and Hot Peppers that were piled high. I kicked off the top bun to reduce intake and resorted to knife & fork for consumption.  There was no way to pick this baby up and bite through it without a major mess.  

The sandwich came with house made Potato Chips, or for a buck or so more, fries or onion rings were available.  Glad I took the basics, because the chips were golden brown as a Sedona sunset, and added to the great overall taste experience.  I couldn't finish them, either. 

Burgatory is worth being on the short list of burger joints when the hankering for a mouthful of ground beef bathed in onions and ketchup won't be denied.  Many levels above its competition in this category.  It even offers Wagyu Beef, Elk, Bison, Crab and Chicken alternatives. As a purist on such things, I am more than content with the basic beef burger.  

All this and classic rock & roll, too!

Hard to beat."}
{"text":"I'm overall concerned at how many burger joints just can't get a burger cooked the way I like it.  I prefer a medium, or a pink center.  Usually it's overcooked.  But sometimes they get it right.  At Burgatory, it's right every time.

As a result it continues to be my favorite \"fancy\" burger place.  I've sampled the Morty's Steakhouse, Elk Gone Wild and created my own creations as well.  I'm never disappointed and appreciate the fact that I know when I go to Burgatory and order a burger cooked medium it will be beautifully delicious.

Fries aren't bad and the onion rings are massive.  I also enjoy the shakes, but mostly I go for the burgers and the homemade chips.  

With over 200 reviews, though, I'm not sure mine is really necessary."}
{"text":"It's decent, but I was a bit disappointed, underwhelmed.  Here's why:

1.  My burger showed up with a COLD bun.  It seemed cooler than room temp.  Why doesn't a burger joint toast or warm the buns?  Big miss in my book.

2.  Service is okay, but some of the servers seem a bit too proud to be working here, for some reason, like I, as a patron, am really lucky to finally get to eat here...  Not very becoming.

3.  The milkshakes have too many little chunks in them for me.  They're weird, and would be better if they were a bit more normal, a bit less cute.

4.  It's kind of pricy for what I get.

So it's certainly not bad, and overall, my burger was pretty tasty. They are a few, glaring misses away (well, four misses) from being really good, so I am pulling for them."}
{"text":"It was an on the spot decision to head to burgatory for a burger.  We had heard good things about it so we thought to give it a shot.  The place is nice.  Spacious and nice.  Service is fast as well.  The menu was nice, you had also the chance to make your own burger so this is a plus too.  The actual food experience was very nice, meat cooked as you ask for it.  I will definitely go back to taste the rest of the burgers! (the list is huge!!!)"}
{"text":"Heavenly shakes, burgers, appetizers, and just about everything on their menu. It's usually really busy, but it's definitely worth the wait.

I've been here quite a few times with my boyfriend. My favorite is the caramel pretzel shake. His is the Nutella crunch shake. I love the crab shack burger and if I'm creating my own - a  guacamole and truffled shallot aioli combo is my go to."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy I got Burgatory in my tummy is what I was singing in my head my last trip here...  I should preface that this was the first time I have eaten in at Burgatory, as other attempts were halted due to extreme wait times.  In the past my office has ordered takeout from the Waterworks location.  The take-out was still yummy, but through transportation and whatnot the burger arrived pretty messed up.  So eating in is my preferred method.

Last time there was a real treat as I usually don't get to go out to eat for lunch due to time constraints and this chain they have on my leg attached to my desk, however I was in luck this day.  My Operations Manager was in town that week and asked if he could take me out to lunch to talk about some things.  I happily excepted and strongly suggested Burgatory, so off we went.  

When we got there we didn't have to wait for a table, which is something I had yet to experience with other attempts to eat here.  Seated I looked at the menu and decided on the build your own burger...  I went with the Dry Aged Wagyu, on a wheat bun, with Diablo Dust, Smoked Gouda, Sriracha Remoulade (on the side) with lettuce tomato, onion, and jalapenos.  I like my burgers cooked medium rare, I think Burgatory cooks closer to rare in the middle but that doesn't bother me, but as a tip I would suggest most people would like it a little more cooked.  I on the other hand was extremely pleased.  The burger didn't take too long to come out so we spent the next 10-15 minutes in complete silence as we ate...  Oh so much better than takeout!  This is up there with one of the best burgers I've ever had, and since it's on the boss it was also the cheapest, meaning free.  Can't turn that down ever.  Can't wait until they finish their new location east of the city, 3 miles from me : )"}
{"text":"Good environment, and good, quick service. We were knew to the restaurant, so the server did a good job explaining the menu. I got the farmhouse burger and it was tasty...good to know that \"pink\" in the burger, really is pink, not so much medium. The chips are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Always delicious. I am a vegetarian (currently vegan) and the veggie burger is awesome. They also offer vegan cheese! I've been to several locations and the quality of the food and service is always great."}
{"text":"The burgers here are incredible--try the Wagu beef burger, or for something different, the portabella mushroom burger or veggie burger. The corn bread with honey butter is a must have, and the salads are delicious. I especially like the marinated roasted tomatoes on the salads. Pretty much the only thing on the menu I've been disappointed with is the nachos. They were piled high with heaps of questionable \"sauce\" and not as good as those I've had at other restaurants. Everything else has been stellar though. They also have a great selection of draft beers which is always changing, and for those so inclined, alcoholic milk shakes. This place is popular, so be prepared to wait 45 min to an hour."}
{"text":"My husband discovered Burgatory several years back while on his lunch break. He could not stop raving about it and insisted on taking me there. I'm sure glad he did! The shakes are what did it for me. I'm not much of a burger girl, but let me tell you, the meat they use is so tasty and it's always made to perfection how you request. We have never ordered anything off of the actual menu (aside from shakes), and always get our burgers made to order. In my opinion, that's the best way to go since there are SO MANY combinations you can try. If you don't have the caramel pretzel shake on your way out, you're truly missing out on dessert. My husband goes on Saturdays when there is game meat. He's tried antelope, alligator, and probably others in the past, but sorry to say that's just not my thing. He used to get the burger of the day mailed to him......complete fanatic, but unfortunately, I will say we have not been there for a while. I think too much of a good thing killed it for us a little. Every now and again I will still crave a shake. There fries are nothing spectacular, though (although the chips are tasty)--I'm a fan of beer battered and these fries just don't cut it for me. They remind me of primanti's fries. Check this place out for sure...it's a great place to stop for happy hour too, if you're not trying to gorge yourself :)

P.S. The mushroom salad they used to have is TO DIE FOR. I mean how good can a salad be, right? The answer is insanely good (maybe it was the dressing?). Unfortunately, I don't think they have this anymore, but hopefully they bring it back!!"}
{"text":"If you've never been here you are missing out.

Get a burger, get a shake.

You won't regret the decision.

BUT! Get the NoWait app because you will wait for an hour to an hour and a half if you don't on the weekends."}
{"text":"Very good burgers.  I like check sheets for ordering your burger exactly like you want it.  This place is fun, although I still think Tessaro's has a better burger."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! The burgers are always huge and messy (in a good way) and some of the cocktails have a unique twist to them, which I really appreciate. The custom menu makes it easy to get creative, and their regular menu has plenty to choose from as well. I have a dairy allergy but am not vegan whatsoever, so I love being able to get vegan cheese on a regular burger. The space fills up a little too quickly and the seating isn't as comfortable as it could be, bringing the rating down to four stars. I do wish they could expand to a larger location somehow...the Waterfront is an immense shopping complex and the ridiculously long wait times (even with that app!) are the biggest downfall."}
{"text":"I really really like this new Burgatory location, and I hope it stays a little less crowded for the time being. The North Shore is sort of dead when there isn't a game going on, so I can see that being the case. I can definitely envision coming down here rather than going all the way out to Homestead or Aspinwall and fighting insane crowds. 

I came here after running in the Great Race with my boyfriend and a college friend of his. We were immediately seated and given a table where we could see the game on the TV. For 1:00 pm on a Sunday everything was really efficient. Our server was super friendly and put in drink and food orders at once. I like how after you've been to Burgatory a few times the process becomes incredibly smooth. The draft list at this location was top-notch, with several imperial IPAs and fall beers to choose from. They even had Dogfish Head Punkin Ale on draft, which is a huge favorite of mine. Our food arrived in a timely manner, and everything was perfect like I've come to expect from Burgatory. There don't seem to be any serious new location kinks to be worked out, which is nice. Side note, I tried their guacamole for the first time and it was incredible! Definitely worth getting as an app while waiting for burgers."}
{"text":"Always busy here, but today we had a short wait and were seated in a booth that we requested. I like that they txt you when your table is ready and you can browse the other stores in the meantime. My custom creation (crab burger cooked perfectly) was delicious and the waitress was nice and friendly. My Mom's burger( medium-well) arrived rare, but they promptly cooked her a new one and the Manager brought it over. It was a small inconvenience. They maybe should have upgraded her to some fries or a soft drink for the inconvenience. That's what I would have done when I was a serv"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. Best burger we ever had. We definitely will be going back. Sure its a little expensive for a burger joint but as soon as u realize its not a fast food place u get over it quick"}
{"text":"Since this new location opened up I have been anxiously awaiting going.  I wanted to put it off for a while since they don't take reservations and past experiences at other locations have typically yielded a hefty wait.  BUT we after hearing about the \"no wait\" app, we without hesitation got in line last Saturday night...and it's a good thing we did.  Approximately 25 people in front of us with an hour plus wait.   We headed out when our time was close but unfortunately the roads were slippy, so it took us about 5 more minutes than it should have.  When we arrived, we had missed our 10 minute window... Ah nuts.  Well it worked out we sat at the bar for only a couple minutes before being told our table was ready.

So since they are fairly new I am trying not to be too critical.  I love Burgatory.  I have loved every meal I had at ever one of their other locations I patronized, but unfortunately I think this new one still has some kinks to work out.  First I ordered an IPA on draft (I don't recall the name b/c I had never heard of it but I sampled it at the bar and it was good), my dinner partner had a Belgium Beer draft, not sure of the kind either.   I enjoyed mine he was drinking his slowly.  It was a very cloudy beer.  I was getting ready to order another after the food came and when she came back she told me it actually kicked, and confessed that she screwed up our drinks, supposedly giving me the Belgium and him the IPA.  I wasn't real happy, and just ended up finishing his.  The food took a little long to come out but I wasn't complaining.    We both ordered build your own burger.  I got the Waygu beef, med-rare, toppings, wheat bun.  I have only ordered this burger before.  It has always delivered...Until now.  

So my burger...AHHHH  it was falling apart and sooo greasy.  Really the patty was crumbling under my hands... Pieces of meat littered the table and plate.  I requested extra napkins and good thing I did.  I used them all.  Overall pretty disappointed since the burger I have grown to love was such a messy, greasy, crumbling meal.  My salad that I opt for over the chips was good, and I enjoyed the dressing a lot.  So the meal was over and the check came, and here is the thing.  These drinks we had were not cheap.  I believe mine, though she admittedly gave me the wrong one, was 8.50 a pint.  So I just so happen to notice him signing the check and was like, \"wait let me see that, $58.00 for two beers and two burgers????  I reviewed, well she charged us for the beer that I never got because it kicked...  I flagged her down.  She admitted the mistake and changed the bill.  Still $48.00 for two beers and two burgers that were not that enjoyable was a steep and hard to swallow.  I will go back but I think I will wait a while to give them time to hopefully get their stuff together, service and burger patties."}
{"text":"I like the different meat choices and the shakes are really good. Other than that  over priced and meh. Plenty of other gormet burger places that offer more topping choices and don't charge you for them."}
{"text":"Really good burgers. You can make it any way you want. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Unique burger shop that has a huge selection of burger toppings and condiments. Variety reigns supreme here. The burger was 3 stars but the shake, onion rings, and ambiance were a 4."}
{"text":"Holy moly, this place is spectacular!!!!! For was amazing!!!! Beer was great!!! Not crowded, televisions with games, great atmosphere! Best place we visited in pittsburgh so far!!!!! WOW!"}
{"text":"Great location .
Clean new ish modern building . 
Very nice engaging employees .
Parking lot next door .
Burgers are large, Truly a meal .
Bigger than 5 guys double .
Very good tasting patty , rather thick and cooked perfectly . 
The jalapeños should be fresh , but were soggy and without flavor . 
Fries are optional and additional 1.50 .
They are good , not great . They were not hot , not cold , also small pieces like the bottom of the bag . 
My draft beer was not very cold ."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! You can never go wrong with the six napkin nachos and believe it or not, no matter how crazy it sounds; THE PIGGY BUTTER AND JELLY BURGERS ARE TO DIE FOR! Habenero jelly with peanut butter and candied bacon on a patty made of 50% ground up bacon and 50% ground beef! My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

ALSO DURING LENT, they offer these fish sandwiches (only on Friday's of course) that are absolutely amazing! Make sure you dip in the tartar sauce it makes the already amazing fish sandwich even more AMAZING. My boyfriend and I shared one yesterday and it was so good that we got another one to go just to enjoy today for lunch :) love this place so much!

And you of course can never go wrong with any shake on the menu, they're all mouthwatering. And what's cool is every week they have \"a shake of the week\" which is a featured shake that isn't on the menu. Ugh I just love everything about this place you can never go wrong!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give it No Stars....  1 1/2 hour wait to 1:45.  For a cheeseburger?  REALLY?????  Hostesses were rude and no help.  You have to download an app to make a reservation, even though they dont take reservations.  Then when your app says its ready they dont have a table ready for another 10-25 minutes.  Went to get a milkshake instead of eating at this point and the \"to go\" guy was clueless about translating the menu or how to run the register.   All Burgatory is a yuppie burger joint for people with nothing but time, money and patience to burn.  We just went somewhere else to eat and made our own milkshakes at home because the futility of trying to get something to eat here was too much to bear.  Staff is totally incompetent and has no clue or even a desire to help without an attitude problem.  SAVE YOURSELF !!!!  EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!  Its only burgers, fries and wings...  There is no amount of marketing on this planet to make their burgers and shakes that good...  OBTW I saw no management making sure to keep this place humming....  TOTAL FAIL!!!"}
{"text":"Lexi was awesome. Super great service. Burger was tastey...really wanted a milkshake...but...work...ugh."}
{"text":"It has always been my favorite burger place. It is my go to place when it comes to burgher. Or smoothies! Every smoothie they have is awesome. The chicken burgher and meat lover are my favorites. The jalapeño fries are not as good they were not crispy."}
{"text":"Heavenly burgers and best milk shakes! Can't go wrong with any milk shakes my personal fav is Carmel pretzel milk shake! If you order it for here, they usually give you another half cup for free!! But I usually get them in to go cup cz I know I won't be able to finish it."}
{"text":"I orded a med-rare burger and it was well done.  Also, the burger appeared to be pressed down while on the grill.  No good burger place would do that.  I will try it again, but if this is what Pittsburgh feels is a good burger, might as well go to Five Guys.  Close to the same thing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places......top notch burgers.....best burger chain ive been to.....wish we had these in NY"}
{"text":"Great new recent opening of another location for the beloved Burgatory chain in North Shore. Was pleasantly surprised at how nice and big it was, considering that they were able to seat the party of 15 that I came with all at one table. Same pros of the Burgatory chain in general apply to this location too. One of their huge strengths is their milkshakes ... so many different kinds and they all taste yummy! My favorite ones are probably the Campfire Smores or the Salted Nutella Crunch. Though this time I ended up trying the Eclair Don't Care spiked milkshake. Was a tad disappointed that I could not taste any of the alcohol that was present/not present? in the shake so I will probably err on not getting a spiked one next time. Burgers here have always been pretty good. Like that they give you the option to customize ... lots of different kinds of patties, toppings, cheeses, dressings, condiments, fixings, and sides galore so definitely take advantage of it! In general, the joint leans on the noisier side but that's not terribly surprising, seeing as they also have a sports bar inside the joint as well."}
{"text":"Popping in to give my recommendations--get the fiddy-fiddy burger (with whatever else you like on it) and the toasted caramel almond boozy shake. It has amaretto and is so good. I have never been to other locations and don't know how this one compares, but this location is chill and a good option for if you don't want to drive all the way into Pittsburgh. Also there is a little candy shop right next to it which is fun. Yay Burgatory."}
{"text":"Must stop anytime I am in the Pitt.   Great salads, chicken chilli and did i mention the burgers.   They dont overcook to let the meat's flavor come through.

Service is always fun and fast."}
{"text":"I really like this place...and not just because I'm a burger-lover, but because it's good eats, good portions, and flat-out incredible milkshakes.  This place isn't for someone who cares about their waistline, for sure.

There has to be about a thousand different ways to get a burger...even for the gluten-free and veggie-nuts, this place has something for everyone.  For those who want to truly go with a unique creation, you can even script your own by picking from a near dummy-proof list of choices for various \"phases\" of a burgers' creation (basically, that's sarcasm for a list to create-your-own). 

At the end of the day, if you're looking for a \"rock star\" burger - look no further.  Just be sure to save room for a milkshake...as it might be one of the best you'll ever have. 

Enjoy...and put this place on your regular rotation.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went to University of Pittsburgh's graduation, my niece graduated, and they wanted to go to dinner. The kept saying, what I thought they were saying Purgatory, it wasn't until I tried looking up the site to make reservations, and I was informed it was Burgatory!! Well we went and the food, atmosphere, drinks and our waiter, I think Alex, everything was absolutely fantastic.  Please open one in the Philadelphia area, please come east Burgatory."}
{"text":"5 starts for the \"Phat Patti\" Veggie Burger. Seriously THE BEST - THE BEST - veggie burger I have ever had! I wanted a change from the normal \"custom creations\" when we went last week. I had heard good reviews on the Phat Patti and they were not wrong! Give this one a try if you are wanting something different from the normal meat or poultry options offered here. I will definitely be having this again!"}
{"text":"Button Buster was fantastic,which was enough to fill me up,but fries were just average. ambiance was great. Servers didn't seem happy there so that's why it's 3 stars instead of 4."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm really starting to enjoy this whole Burger movement after having visited a few of these places, and Burgatory left its mark on my hungry soul. I made my own burger and it was delicious, but I have to say I'm about to rave about my drink and side much more.

My friends and I started the night with milkshakes. Maybe we should have saved them for desert (they were more like a meal to themselves), but these milkshakes were delicious. I went for the spiked Monkey Business shake. I love anything banana, but I was pleased from the whipped cream down to the subtle, but definitely there, flavor of rum. 

My absolute favorite part of the meal, however, were the truffled gorgonzola fries. Could there be a better combination of flavors than truffle oil and gorgonzola cheese? Oh yes. Add fries. Amazing.

The burger I created was a thing of beauty as well. I think next time (and I sure hope next time is soon) I'll go with a combination created on the menu to see what they really have up their sleeves."}
{"text":"There are few times that I can say that I have absolutely loved a burger.  This place did it.  The create your own burger (and the crazy amount of options) made this... Perfect.  The chili was amazing, and I've never been really into that either before.  The S'mores shake was to die for, definitely above par from any I have gotten before (get the chocolate vodka in it! It's good with and without!)... And the service was fast, friendly, and attentive.  Best experience at a restaurant I've ever had.  Amazing.  Amazing. Amazing.   Joanna was fantastic, by the way! :D"}
{"text":"Good food and delicious milkshakes.  I had a bison burger for the first time and loved it. I also had a burnt almond torte milkshake with alcohol. That was the best shake ever. I love their food I wasn't a fan the chips I recommend getting French fries. Went at lunch time and was able to be quickly seated. I've heard horror stories about the long wait to get in. They now have 3 locations so hopefully they will help. Robinson twp, waterworks mall and the waterfront mall."}
{"text":"I'm guessing this is a Pittsburgh area chain as we saw one en-route here and then another within easy walking distance from our hotel in Homestead but had never heard of it before. The name intrigued us and since there was a veggie burger on the menu (actually two) and this is a must for me for a burger place, we decided to give it a try. Sports bar like atmosphere with two televisions with two different baseball games on. Fun signage adds to the atmosphere. Now for the burgers: two choices for veggie burgers. One is the Impossible Burger, which is geared toward meat lovers but since I am not a fan of \"meat like\" veggie burgers, I ordered the vegan option and it did not disappoint. Now here is where it can get overwhelming (but in a good way!) You can choose burgers from the menu OR you can build your own from a very large list of options from the bun, rub, sauce, cheeses, toppings, and sides. Chips are the standard side but there are other interesting options. I chose the Napa slaw which was a good accompaniment to the burger. Of course there are many meat burgers and my husband had the Fiddy Fiddy (half bacon and half ground beef) which he also customized. Be forewarned that it can get pricey when you start adding options (two custom burgers, two beers, one extra side plus tax and tip was $55). Was pleased to see Dogfish Head's Dragons and Yum Yums on draft and husband was happy to get their 60 minute IPA (in cans). Apparently their creative shakes are all the rage but we were so full after our burgers, we couldn't even think about it! Nice concept for a burger place and we enjoyed our meal!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite burger joint in the Burgh.  I've eaten here a few times and have yet to have a juivlcy burger as they always seem to over season the meat causing even a medium rare burger to seem dry and salty.  I do love their boozy milkshakes as they always have a fun concoction on the menu to try.  Also they often partner with other local businesses and bakeries to source fun ingredients for the milkshakes."}
{"text":"Crab cake with shells, greasy mess of fries, and nasty beans turned a 4 star experience into just being 2.

It was a Saturday... lunch... noon... 20 min wait as advertised... text message system worked as advertised... the \"thank you\" message after we left seemed over kill.

Waitress was super fast... but when she saw we were discussing the choose your own burger pad she didn't even try to up sell us to the specials... we were half way done when a table near us sat and we heard all that we missed.

Shakes were as advertised... I wish we hadn't been driving... the alcoholic selection looked like mudslide heaven!  Straws are REALLY large in diameter and handled the pretzel bits of the Caramel Pretzel really well... 1 $6 shake was more than enough for 2 people... it was like starting a meal with dessert but the huge glasses of water carried us through the rest of the meal and were refilled promptly.

Frites with Parmesan Peppercorn - cute small bucket with a big problem... so much parm that it sweat out a TON of grease and the bottom 1/4 of the bucket was inedible... and it wasn't like you could get a handle on any of the fries... none of them were longer than 1.5 inches...so it was a bucket of ends?

Build your own burger should come with some warnings... the waitress told us that Brioche is just white bread \"in case you didn't know\"... um... no... it's not... but... um... yes... that's what it was... nothing eggy or sweet or any texture resembling Brioche... except the way the bun is formed.

You can skip the run section... we didn't taste the sweet onion rub on either a beef or a crab burger... and skip the provolone if you like that... it was kind of chewy... no taste... the cheddar was ok

Beef burger came out medium as requested... tasted great... BBQ sauce was great... baked bean side dish was straight up nasty... we couldn't decide what it was made of... and didn't care... 1 bite each... left the rest.

Crab burger... mostly bread in pockets... 2 dime size pieces of shell... more or less tasteless... the garlic mayo was nice... pickle chips were good... tried to eat just the crab cake to see if we could taste anything... and I mean anything... on it's own... nope... finished it only because of the cost... and the time... and not wanting to go somewhere else on a Saturday at 2... because by then it was 2 pm... and we were ready for any place quieter!

Jalapeno cornbread had lots of corn kernels and more pepper taste than heat... the honey butter was puzzling... the cornbread wasn't sweet on it's own... we felt like we missed something in the story behind the sides... not that there are any explanations of them on the menu.

We don't live in the area and would not give it a second try... there are literally dozens of other options that we could have spent $40 (before tip) on 2 burgers, 1 order of fries, 2 sides, and 1 milkshake."}
{"text":"Burgatory is an awesome, solid restaurant that I'd consider a perfect blend of \"safe\" in that they have thick, juicy delicious burgers that are predictable (yet creative), you have control over what you order, and you get tons of food for your buck! 

Who should visit with me? Bring the whole gang. We had a group of 6 people and it was perfect for sharing ideas on burger creations! 

Favorite thing about this place: My favorite thing is that I have the ultimate control over my burger. I also love the shakes - they will blow you away! 

I'd love it more if: I'd really love if they had more descriptions somewhere on what all the rubs and sauce choices are for the burger building. I had to ask and he ran through all them - but all I needed really was a few short words of description on the menu to take care of that so as not to delay my whole party while ordering! 

Ambience/Location: Lovely. Awesome, consistent branding throughout the locations makes it feel like you're at home when you come there. (Although it's the whole purgatory heaven/hell theme). Somehow it feels like home (since I don't like in Pittsburgh anymore, it's a welcome sight!) 

Service: Very good. Server was super attentive and helpful. We sat for a while and could have used more drink refills on our waters, but he kinda gave up on us since they got a little busier. No problem - we could have asked. 

Tips:
1) You can get alcoholic shakes without the alcohol! 
2) Try a weird rub that you wouldn't normally try - it doesn't make a huge difference, and may open you up to something new! 
3) Exchange your chips for some greens - it's worth it. You won't be hungry, I promise! Seriously, I'm always SO full when I leave here. 

Recommended Dish: Choco Taco shake with no alcohol!"}
{"text":"They have a pretty convenient location for those going to games or other events. We were told the wait would be an hour but it ended up only being a half hour wait. It's nice that they call you when your table is ready. We took a stroll down by the water while waiting. Everyone in my group (but me) got milkshakes. It was an overwhelming 10/10 for those. The onion rings were massive. Pretty tasty and the dips that come along are flavorful. I love that they do build your own burgers! The creations on the menu sound incredible. I was tempting by the crab burger but stuck with my salad. I got the grilled chicken salad without bacon, cheese,egg or croutons. I know I'm a buzz kill. The dressing that came with it was delicious. Only downside was the avocado they put on it. It wasn't ripe at all. Very hard trying to bite into it. You think that's pretty obvious when you cut it but hey things happen. I saw that they offer vegan milkshakes. I'm pretty excited to go back and try one. It's been a long time since I've had a shake. The waitress was friendly and attentive to allergy concerns in the group. Great spot to grab some food or drinks."}
{"text":"Four of us went during the first few days this restaurant opened. we ordered the fries (delicious, with rosemary and salt) and each ordered a burger. I had the steakhouse which has a red wine sauce and was really very good it came as I ordered medium well. The other three people who were in our party all had a problem with the way the burgers were cooked. Everyone else's were too overcooked, my parner's burger was cooked to a crispy well done even though she had ordered it medium. 

Our waitress was happy to send my partner's burger back and have it made correctly. Our waitress also seemed very nervous and seemed on the verge of a nervous breakdown.

Overall I liked my own burger but was unimpressed that 3 our of 4 burgers that were ordered at our table were cooked incorrectly. I will likely not be going back to this restaurant. I felt it was also a little overpriced. 

For a great burger I will continue to go to Tessaros"}
{"text":"Full disclosure:  I love Tessaro's, they make a mean, mean burger, so when a friend suggested we go to Burgatory, I thought I would be disappointed.

I was not!  We ended up going late in the afternoon on Christmas Eve.  Despite the fact that the Steelers were playing, the place was only one-third full so we got in right away.

While the menu burgers all sounded great, I decided to do the \"meat your maker\".  I had the black peppercorn rub on ground sirloin topped with field greens, tomato, red onion, and cheddar with their homemade mayo.  You can choose three \"doneness\":  bloody, pink, and none.  I'm a medium-well girl so I just noted that on the little card you use when you create your own burger (since I didn't know if that fit into pink or none category).

The burger for me was done perfectly:  just enough pink in the middle and mega juicy.  The bun was freshly made and since they buttered it and then grilled it on the flatiron, it was similar to texas toast (yum).  The rub was a good complement to the meat, and the toppings were fresh and wonderful.

The burgers come with homemade chips, a mix of russet and sweet potato.  At first, I thought I'd spring for fries, but honestly the chips are really, really good:  lightly seasoned with a bit of pepper and sea salt and went well with the burger.

Service was prompt and efficient and she did a great job explaining the menu and all of the variations/options.  For what you get and the quality of the ingredients, the meal is quite affordable.

I (as it turned out wisely) thought that a milkshake and a burger would be too much.  I think the next time I go I'll split a milkshake with someone to have with my meal.  They all looked fantastic.

How does this compare to Tessaro's?  The burgers at Tessaro's are a tad bigger (maybe by a healthy ounce) and while the meat quality is similar.  You can taste the smokiness from Tessaro's wood fired grill.  However, Tessaro's does not use a rub, so you get a different flavor from a Burgatory burger which is a different taste, but to my pallet, just as good.  Tessaro's home fries edged out Burgatory's side of chips.  So the verdict for me is that Tessaro's is just a hair better--but Burgatory is also very, very good."}
{"text":"I only recently moved to the area, and one of the first places my friends took my was Burgatory. I've now been a few times and it is definitely a great place for some meaty noms. For me it's complicated because picking your own toppings can get difficult for me. Also I always end up with a few hundred. But every time, despite what weird concoction I've created I am always happy with my burger. 

The spiked milkshakes are so delicious that they make me willingly ingest dairy (which I never do) because they are simply irresistible. 

While this place is called burgatory, it's definitely heaven for burger lovers."}
{"text":"I've been to Burgatory with large groups on several occasions and always had a good experience. Making your own burger is pretty fun and the veggie burger is great! The mixed drinks are strong, so beware if you are a lightweight like me! 
The milkshakes are delicious (and you can get \"adult\" versions that are spiked), but I never have room for one after I'm done eating. I've found that getting 1 or 2 milkshakes for a table of 4-6 tends to be more than enough for everyone.
The restaurant itself has a great design- LOVE the design of the menus and the wall graphics, etc. Friendly and relatively fast service - no complaints here! Lots of parking, too."}
{"text":"I was delightfully surprised with how good Burgatory was. I went there with a fear that I was in for a Red Robin'esq experience, over priced mediocre burgers, cheesy restaurant design, and tons of gimmicks. Fortunately Burgatory was as far from this as possible. The burgers were fantastic and I loved the build your own burger check list concept. I can't wait to come back and try another creation. 

Just to give an idea of what you can expect to spend, a \"build your own burger\" and a Yuengling was about $13. Also if you are getting there during the dinner rush expect a 30-45 minute wait, fortunately there are plenty of things to keep you occupied near by. We went to Uncle Sam's Subs and had a beer while we waited."}
{"text":"We went there tonight, Thursday around 6 for a birthday meal. When we arrived we were greeted right away and were seated. The place was busy but not overly crowded. We sat and looked at the menu for about 5 minutes, while several servers flitted by, dropping checks off at tables etc. We continued looking at menus for quite a bit (3 to 5 minutes) and my husband excused himself to the restroom.  I continued to sit, now looking around and still not being greeted by any staff whatsoever. The table to the right of mine was seated and there was a server at the table greeting them before my husband returned from the bathroom. He returned, and we left! (Now 10 to 15 minutes) As we were leaving, there was noone even at the front desk to complain to! I do not see me returning anytime soom! Grossly disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times, but have not been to any of the others. This one is really nice though! It feels very industrious and it's a large space with a lot of variety in types of seating. It's usually really busy so you should use open table to reserve your name on their waiting list! It saves you a lot of time and grief.

I always 'make my own' burger and have always really enjoyed them. There are so many options and I feel like you really can't go wrong. The ingredients are super fresh and still so the next day if you have left overs. About that... they're pretty large! I get pretty full off of one half. They typically come with a side of chips, which also stay really crispy the next day.

Other than burgers, I've replaced my chips for fries a few times, and I've also tried their milkshakes and onion rings. The milkshakes are very very good! I've tried all except their chocolate one. My two favorite are the smore's one and the caramel pretzel one. And the onion rings are HUGE, like as big as my face! But they're good and filling. 

There's a reason it's always so busy so if you're contemplating on going, you should definitely go!"}
{"text":"The burger I had here was literally the best burger I've ever had enter the holy boundaries of my mouth. Every second that I held it in my hand, every moment it rested on my tongue, was like fulfilling a life long dream I never knew I had. All that was present in my room was me and my burger and the moment it entered my mouth I knew I found my true love. As I licked my lips saying goodbye to the burger, I promised that I will return to see it once again."}
{"text":"Meh, I've had better burgers. It was extremely loud and slower service. I'd just as much go next door to 5 guys and get a cheaper, better burger."}
{"text":"pleasantly surprised!  i expected the vegan veggie burger to taste like cardboard but it was crunchy, tasty, and accompanied by some of the best onion rings i've ever had.  i was with a big group on a sunday afternoon and even though it was super crowded, it wasn't loud and service was fast and friendly.  i'd go there again the next time i'm in pittsburgh."}
{"text":"When I moved to The Burgh Burgatory was one of the first restaurants I heard of. So as you can imagine they have been on my list ever since. I finally had the chance to try them a few weekends ago. I must state that I used the no wait app. It said there was no wait the entire 15 min it took to get there. However when I arrival I was told there would be a 15 min wait for a table. 

We were seated by a window in the front of the place. Which is fine with me. I enjoy people watching and lateral rotation. Our waitress showed up about ten min later and asked for our drink orders. I already knew I wanted a hard shake. I went with the espresso love because coffee!!!  I really liked it. I wasn't expecting the little bits of crunch that I believe were chocolate covered coffee beans. 

For my burger I had a hard time choosing. I ended up going with one off the menu instead of creating my own. I felt it was a better way to judge the quality of the place then making my own. I chose the Pot Luck burger and while I did really enjoy it I was a bit greasy. I also opted for fries instead of chips. I love the rosemary seasoning on the fries. It is one of my favorite herbs. However I found myself wishing the fries had a bit more of a crunch. 

Overall service was slow and a bit lacking. Our waitress felt the need to explain every thing on the menu if there was even a question about one thing. I appreciated that but I'm also well aware of what smoked Gouda tastes like. 

I have been to burger competitions and consider myself well versed in the burger department and while this wasn't the best burger I've ever had. It was was good."}
{"text":"Finally the burger I was craving all trip long. They have a selection of burgers to choose from or the option to customize your burger completely. For the latter you fill in a little form to tell them which type of bun, meat (and how well cooked) , toppings, sauce, sides, etc. you want. The burger was very tasty and cooked as I asked for. It could have been a bit juicier though. The place is comfy and has an appealing interior. Service was good too."}
{"text":"Best burgers in the city - love the build-it-yourself-option.  

Very good milkshakes as well (a close 2nd to BRGR's milkshakes though)"}
{"text":"I was here in Pittsburgh for a working weekend, stopped by the restaurant on a Saturday evening and it was slammed. I took a seat at the bar and got quick service. You can make your own or order one off of the menu. I ordered one off the menu and it was good - but not great. The bartender / server ordered me and charged me for fries even though I ordered chips but took it right off when I mentioned it to him. Kinda pricey and overly trendy but it was neat at the same time. I'd go again but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Wow. If I were a burger joint around here, this would be my biggest fear. 
If you ask anyone that knows me, I am an incredibly fast eater and I always have been with any food. Not these burgers. 
 After constructing the burger from the extensive list of toppings, buns, and meats I anxiously waited for the food to come. I have heard many things about this place From co-workers and friends so I had slightly high hopes, Wow. 
I had no idea that all of their food was made on the premises from burgers to ice cream but boy can you tell. Each bite of the burger screamed fresh and tasty and I didn't even get to the milkshake yet. After the first bite of my burger I actually sat back and looked at the burger to try and take in the flavor. The Peppercorn rub ads some hell of flavor that I haven't experienced with other burgers, it made me ashamed to think that Five Guys burgers were so good. 
As for the milkshake, I have to disclaimer this with the fact that I am a milkshake connoisseur and very picky about my milkshakes to the point that I cannot stomach the garbage that place like DQ and Chic-Fil-a try to pass off as shakes. The milkshakes here are incredible. Due to the ice cream being homemade they are real milkshakes tithe core and you can taste that with every sip of the shake. I got the s'mores shake and it was the tastiest drink I can remember having in a long time. 
My only fear for this restaurant is the fact that the menu and customer service are so top notch I will find myself here very frequently and my future potbelly is a scary thought. It would be very difficult for me not to recommend this joint as a place every Pittsburgher and tourist should visit; in fact I condone the notion that every Pittsburgher should try a price of this amazing Hometown delight.
Every aspect of the meal was nailed and executed perfect. Careful of a wait but come hungry and you won't be disappointed. Be prepared to make a second trip due to the extensive menu to make sure you get the best that Burgatory has to offer."}
{"text":"This is a fun place, albeit crowded. The burgers are great, and customizable- and their shakes are also very good. They put some good effort into the decor, and the logo and theme are a nice and fun touch.

They also have a bunch of TVs playing sports channels, and a bar (not sure if you can order food at the bar, but I think so.)"}
{"text":"Love this place in Pittsburgh. It is all made to order and custom to what you want from everything from the type of meat to the type of bread for the burger bun. For my side I had the deviled egg potato salad which was also very delicious. The ambiance is great and prices are reasonable. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Am in Pittsburgh to drop daughter at Pitt. Found this restaurant on yelp. Upon arrival checked in where we were told there would be a twenty to thirty minute wait. I gave the person checking in guests my cell. They use online wait list. We waited about 30 mins to be seated. We were waited on within 5 minutes. Service was quick and friendly. Beer was cold and fresh. We ordered the burgers a few using the custom menu. The food arrived within a reasonable amount of time. The burgers were amazing, one of the best I've ever had. I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Don't yinz hate me for this but I'm not thrilled :( i was expecting a big juicy burger for the hype and price but I got dry and not very flavorful. I'm not into the sweet potatoes at all and didn't have time for a shake when I realized I wasn't going to do more than pick at my food. 
I'll give them another try because those shakes look amazing but I left hungry and underwhelmed :/ 
The three stars are because my waitress was nice , the place was nice, the shakes I saw others get had me drooling, and my unpicky coworker said it was dry but ate the whole thing.
Maybe I'll try a shake tomorrow"}
{"text":"Burgers are pretty good but giving the 5 for my rice krispy milkshake. Awesome milkshakes, don't skip dessert here."}
{"text":"WOW. So many great things rolled into one to make my trip to Burgatory one of the top dining experiences I've ever had. 

I'll start with the service. It was top notch. Our waiter (wish I remembered his name) was EXCELLENT and was always back checking on us, gave great recommendations, and showed that he really cared.

Next, the food. I'd heard rave reviews about this place so I was excited for the chance to try. We started with the gorgonzola truffle fries.....again wow. I am not usually a big fry person, but I devoured these flavor-packed bad boys. (Also great to get them 1/2 off during happy hour!) For the burger side of things, a friend and I ordered two different things and split so I got to try the Crab Cake burger (from the menu) as well as the PB burger with Habanero jelly. LOVED them both, but I think the PB burger won. 

To cap it all off, the shakes are definitely worth it. I got the S'mores variety and was quite pleased.

Safe to say I will definitely be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"What a fun place to come with friends or family. Burgers and milkshakes are delicious!!! Definitely able to split a milkshake. Cute atmosphere and location too!"}
{"text":"Love it! very friendly workers. 
I went there few times with friends for dinner and the time would fly by. We would be one of the last people to leave before closing and the workers were always polite and never ever rushed us."}
{"text":"Burgatory is brilliant. Its burgers are cooked to perfection, but that is the outcome. At the start, one may order a standard burger from the menu, or create your own. That is what we all did. Using a checklist at the table, patrons may select the type of bun, meat, rub, cheese, sauce, condiments, toppings and add-ons. \"Red, Pink, No Pink\" are the cooking options. My burger came out exactly as I ordered.

I've consumed many a burger over the decades, but this was undoubtedly one of the best.

Burgatory has a call-ahead list. I recommend it. It was crowded on a Saturday evening, but we were seated promptly."}
{"text":"The \"Farmer Brown\" - seriously the best burger I've ever tasted. Fresh ingredients, excellent service, novel concept. 

If I had to pick a down side, it's usually very crowded and noisy. I've experienced a 2-hour wait time, but they use a great reservation-type service called \"No Wait\". Give them your phone number, and they'll text you when your table is ready. The service texts a link right away and allows you to see where you are in line - very cool.

The shakes are awesome too, but usually way too filling for me."}
{"text":"I've discovered the \"Farmer Brown\" burger. 5 stars for sure. See my review for the Robinson Burgatory for the complete review, but this burger is awesome."}
{"text":"Very tasty treat before a baseball game! Only complaint would be the baked beans were dry and  I asked for a pink burger and got a pretty rare burger. Service was great and convenient location if you are headed to the stadiums!"}
{"text":"Great burgers! Customize your own and get the cajun rub and smoked gouda cheese.. Thank me later! Expensive but probably worth it, and that's not something id normally say about a $15 burger with fries."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Expensive but probably worth it, and thats not something id normally say about a $15 burger with fries."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to Burgatory at the Waterfront this past week. I have to say, they were totally on point.  We were greeted with smiling faces at the door and seated right away.  Our server was really helpful and, again, on point. I ended up ordering a burger and got the side salad with it. Everything came out in a timely manner, the burger was just perfect and the side salad was killer.  I haven't been to Burgatory in a while, but I will return sooner than later.  They are like a well-oiled machine. Good food and great service. A really great dining experience. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"this place doesn't live up to the hype, in my opinion.  the alcoholic milkshakes are good.  the sweet potato chips are pretty good.  but, the burgers?  meh.  

go to tessaro's."}
{"text":"I stopped by on Fri., 12/19 at around 5:15pm with a friend to claim my free birthday milkshake for being on the mailing list (if you're not on it and want a free milkshake on your birthday, sign up!) and to have a snack. I was a bit concerned that there'd be a lengthy wait, but I checked the NoWait app, and to my surprise, it said there was no wait (what?!?).  True enough, my friend and I were able to walk in and get seated right away.

When our waitress came, I inquired about a mint chocolate chip milkshake that I'd seen advertised as milkshake of the week a couple weeks before.  She said they were out of the materials to make it, which was a bummer, since mint chocolate chip is my absolute favorite type of ice cream.  The milkshake of the week for that week didn't interest me, since it involved coconut (I'm not a coconut aficionado), so I decided to order the choco taco milkshake (unspiked--since the free milkshake offer didn't include alcohol) off the regular menu.  My friend ordered the caramel pretzel milkshake for herself, and we ordered the chips and guacamole to split.

As expected, the milkshakes were ginormous and delicious.  They were infused with pieces of chocolate-dipped wafers and pretzels, requiring use of the spoon to eat them, in addition to the straw.  The flavors in both were delicious, with a nice sweet-salty balance.  My only criticism is that there was a lot of whipped cream, which made for a somewhat anticlimactic finish.

The chips and guacamole were pretty good, providing a salty counterbalance to the dominant sweetness of the milkshakes.  The guac had chunks of avocado, and the lime gave the flavor a nice citrusy pop.  While the red pepper pieces provided a pleasant color contrast (see photo), I avoided them, since I'm not a huge fan of raw peppers.

Overall, my friend and I had a good time at this Burgatory, despite just ordering snacks and milkshakes.  (See my review of the Waterworks Burgatory for my thoughts on the burgers.)  I'll have to return again soon to try a spiked shake (such as the burnt almont torte one!) and a burger at this location."}
{"text":"I ordered the make your own burger with chicken, gorgonzola, mixed greens and tomato on focaccia.  It was extremely filling and delicious!  My dining companion, who's not a vegetarian, ordered the veggie burger with farmhouse cheddar and told me it was excellent.  She's gluten-sensitive, so she appreciated the gluten-free bun option (which she took advantage of), as well as our waitress asking about the acceptability of small amounts of gluten in other items.  We ordered the gorgonzola truffle fries to split to go with our burgers, and they were a great accompaniment.

In addition to the burgers, we ordered the salted Nutella crunch shake (one of two shakes without gluten) and split it, which was the perfect amount for two people.  Although the burgers were great, the milkshake was the star of the show!  It was incredibly thick and creamy, and the salty and sweet flavors of the Nutella and Crunch bars melded together wonderfully.  There are so many interesting and creative milkshakes on the menu--I look forward to returning to try the others (without the gluten restriction :-) and figuring out my favorites.  (Sign up for the mailing list and they'll send you a free milkshake coupon for your birthday!)

Service was good, and we used the NoWait app to cut down on the time we had to wait to be seated.  Personally, I'm not a huge fan of the sports bar-like, strip mall atmosphere. For burgers, I found it on par with BRGR; Burgatory wins for milkshakes, and BRGR wins for atmosphere.  I can't comment on the beef burgers or doneness since I don't eat red meat. 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I was on the North Shore last night and was looking for dinner after going to the 21+ night at the Carnegie Science Center.  Given that I'd seen a few photos posted from this new Burgatory in the past couple of days, I knew it was finally open, so I decided to check it out.  

Having been to the Waterworks and Waterfront branches, I knew what to expect, and fortunately, this Burgatory delivered.  My dining partner and I started by splitting a cookie monster shake.  It was delicious, with lots of cookie chunks, and provided just the right amount for both of us.  The kitchen also honored my request to go light on the whipped cream, an option I recommend if you don't like mounds of whipped cream on your shake.

For our burgers, we both opted for custom burgers, since this is what Burgatory is known for.  I had the crab burger on a pretzel bun with the cajun rub, grilled pineapple, truffled shallot aioli, tomato, and arugula.  While the crab patty was decent in flavor, it was quite soft, making it a bit awkward to eat on a burger.  The flavor of the grilled pineapple complemented it nicely, though the juice made the crab patty a bit soggy after biting into it.  While it wasn't a bad burger, I prefer the chicken burger I had last time due to its firmness.  My dining partner had the fifty-fifty burger, which comes out looking pink despite being well-done.  Since he chose the options, I don't remember all of them, but I know he got it on herbed focaccia and with field greens, cucumber, and onions.  He enjoyed his burger very much.

Surprisingly, we were able to get seated without any wait whatsoever--a rarity at Burgatory.  I'm guessing this is because people don't realize that this branch is open yet, so enjoy it while you can.  Our service was excellent, with our waitress stopping to check on us at several points in the meal, which was probably a result of it not being super-crowded.  Needless to say, this new branch of Burgatory beats many of the mediocre North Shore eateries, so if you're in the neighborhood and are hungry, check it out!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the second time as was underwhelmed.  I tried the burgers before which are just OK. This time I tried a chicken teriyaki burger and was underwhelmed.  It tasted kinda cheap.
Then there is the burnt potato chips that don't have a good flavor.
My milkshake was fantastic and it was the only good part.
The concept and environment are cool but the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"I don't know if I was expecting too much since so many of my friends hyped it up or what,  but Burgatory left me feeling severely underwhelmed. The veggie burger was just ok, not great. The portobello steak fries were okay, but the portion was huge and pricey. If rather have half as many fir a few dollars left than lits leftover. They taste HORRIBLE heated up or cold later. A friend compared them to dolphin skin in their leftover state.. ick. The sauce for them was the best thing I tasted that evening. The biggest negative is the chairs. They're cute, but miserable to sit in. I was in pain and probably would have left if I had not been with a group of friends. They are really that bad."}
{"text":"Excellent choices, fantastic shakes, plenty of vegan options and the service was quick and awesome!"}
{"text":"Good, above average burger.  The homemade chips left a little to be desired.  The sweet potato chips were soggy and the \"regular\" chips were hard to the point I was worried about my dental work.  Good overall.  I'd go back if I'm in the area but probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger places hands down!!!  First time ever having Elk, and it was fantastic!  I may never eat beef again.  One of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Great place for a date night, a group, they have outdoor seating for the summertime, and it's right in the middle of shops and the movie theater so convenience box is checked . My boyfriend and I have an M.O. - get delicious shakes, watch whatever game is on the tv by the bar, and then go see a movie. Service is fabulous here! Wouldn't go to any other burgatory!"}
{"text":"Another amazing meal with awesome service thank you to the burgertory staff and ended the meal with the giant chocolate chip cookie Sunday which was GIANT in taste as well as size."}
{"text":"Good food but 2 out of last 3 visits we had issues with the items and had to have them remade. They were very kind about it but it's kind of annoying to wait extra long for already somewhat expensive food."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! However if you like a more quiet intimate setting this place wouldn't be for you. It's hard to have a conversation without talking loudly because everything seems to echo. When asked for the wifi password. The waitress said she couldn't give it out! WTF????"}
{"text":"Elk Gone Wild w/ a side of Chili. Tasty with  some heat to both. I highly recommend this combo. Ice water might help. My second time here."}
{"text":"We heard about Burgatory from family members who went there after visiting at the Hospital next door and thought we would do the same. The space is really nice--and both evenings it was pleasantly crowded but not oppressively so. Burgers were great. Good choices for beer/ drinks. We visited twice and really loved the salads - as they were fresh, crunchy and robust."}
{"text":"Well, if you are looking to just stuff yourself all American style, this is the place. The milkshakes are amazing whether you do spiked or traditional. The fries can be served as truffle Gorgonzola fries and they are absolutely terrific. I am a vegetarian and I love the veggie burger that can be customized with so many awesome and unique options. This definitely wins out the war of PGH area burger joints and is worth the drive to the suburbs."}
{"text":"Burgatory McCandless has lived up to the standards of all the other Burgatorys! Its a must stop if you are in the North Hills if you want some yummy burgers and awesome craft cocktails. Mike Margarita will knock your socks off. Happy hour is awesome as well. Half off apps, 5 dollar cocktails and half off drafts."}
{"text":"Best burgers in city!! The burgers are juicy the staff is friendly! The vibe in the restaurant is perfect for a fun night out. It's a must go spot!"}
{"text":"I was traveling for work when some coworkers recommended we grab dinner here. I have to tell you, I was not disappointed. This place is a burger lovers dream come true. I have to be honest, I'm not much of a burger lover but I enjoyed my dinner. 

No wait, great attentive staff, great seating, atmosphere was exciting and TVs with the game on were a plus. 

You have a list of amazing burgers you can pick from with different toppings. They have traditional burgers and some none traditional ones as well. I opted to try the bison burger. It came with this great buttermilk ranch sauce which made it taste amazing. You can also custom made a burger if you don't like any of the selections. 

My co workers told me to try the \"home made chips\" that come with the burger and so I did. Although I wish I had selected another side like the steamed veggies or fries. The chips are what really stopped me from giving this place 5 stars. The home made fries really didn't cut it for me. Tasted kind of stale.

Let's talk about why I enjoyed this place. I was told to save room for dessert. This place has some amazing shakes. I got the coffee and donut shake. It was great, a bit sweet, but it is a dessert, after all."}
{"text":"Their cookie monster milkshake was delicious!! The burger was pretty good, then again I can't judge it based on I did a custom one. The burger was taste and juicy though. Great experience"}
{"text":"A group of us made another trip out to Burgatory after an exam last week, and I'm still a fan for sure!  I can now vouch for the boozy milkshakes and the veggie burger.

First, the shakes: so delicious.  If you survive a four hour exam, you totally deserve a gigantic milkshake with chocolate and coffee and tequila, right?  I think so.

Second, the veggie burger: I've recently become a fan of house-made veggie burgers, and in my world, ordering a quasi-healthy veggie burger instead of a beef burger totally legitimized ordering a giant tequila-laden milkshake.  (I hope you're enjoying all of the justifications in this review.)  I'm not a vegetarian or vegan so traditionally I'm a veggie burger skeptic, but this one was delicious: the mushrooms and lentils combine for a great flavor, and the cashews were an interesting touch.  My vegetarian friend isn't a cashew fan, but she ended up liking it a lot (they're not in big pieces or anything).  Do note that you're probably out of luck if you're both nut-allergic and vegan/veggie.  I put my burger on a wheat bun and added lettuce, tomato, poblano peppers, cheddar, crispy onions and sriracha aioli, and it turned out delicious!

Greensburg has a couple of good burger places in town so I probably won't make the trip to Murrysville too often, but if I lived near a Burgatory I'd happily be a regular."}
{"text":"Phenomenal atmosphere and just as amazing food. If you're in the greater Pittsburgh area you MUST visit this eatery. Natural ingredients that just shine through the burgers. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed. Cool atmosphere. I got a burger with a few toppings and found the meat to be very bland and flavorless. I like the idea, but I've seen it executed way better.  Save your money."}
{"text":"First, before I delve into this review, I'm a huge fan of and am sure to tell other people of Burgatory.  Which is why it is so hard to write this review.

This was not my first visit here, it was my second.  The first visit I made here ended up with me turning right around and walking away.  It was so crowded (on a Tuesday night) that I just didn't even want to deal with the crowd.  Funny thing is with this new location, instead of expanding it in any direction, it's still the same size as when the other restaurants that failed in this spot.

Now onto my most recent visit.  We showed up and there was a bit of a wait.  After giving our name to the hostess, we ventured over to the bar.  While at the bar, we decided to sit at the bar and have our experience of the place instead of sitting at a table (had to go back to the hostess to have our name removed from the wait list).  We both ordered some drinks, a fairly decent list of IPAs on draft and we put in for an appetizer.  The truffled Gorgonzola fries were pretty amazing.  When we ordered the burgers, that's when it went downhill for me.

I opted for the make your own burger.  After scribbling and rewriting we had our orders down.  Handed them over to the bartender and just had to wait.  I had ordered my burger topless (just the bottom of the bun).  When the burger arrived everything that my eyes could see at the time looked perfect.  Whenever I cut into this delicious display of beefiness, that when I got to see what was underneath.  The bun was soggy, not the type of soggy that you get from the juices of the burger, or the wetness of the fresh vegetables, but soggy in the pink kind of way.  I was a little concerned about this and informed the bartender I would not be eating this.  While I give him credit for trying to explain to me that the pinkness to my bun was just the juices running of the burger patty, I had to disagree with him.  Mind you, I ordered my burger cooked to medium well, if there were any juices from the burger they sure as hell would not be pink.  There was no smell to it either, so it could not have been a dressing for a salad.

After a trip to the kitchen the bartender came back out to me and said that the cook said that's how they cook.  I'm sorry, but that doesn't make me want to eat the burger any more than the fact that I can see with my own eyes that the bun portion was pink.

In the end, they offered to make me another burger (I assumed it would have been free, but wasn't).  I opted to have it to go, good thing I did, by the time all this was over and the burger was ready my friend had finished her meal.  The manager came over as well and apologized to me for the mistake made and after handing me my bag with my new burger in it, she also handed a coupon thing for a free milkshake the next time I visit (thanks a million for that, giving me a coupon for something free that I cannot not use because of a food related allergy).

To sum it all up, even though this place is literally like ten minutes from my house, I'll stick to the original spot and not take my chances again."}
{"text":"I just need to reiterate how much I love this place.  I mean who can go wrong with burgers?

My most recent visit here included members of my family.  My family not being from the city have heard me talk about this place so much that when they came down they insisted on me taking them there.  

Of course when we arrived there was a wait, I told them that most likely there would be, not only because it's so good, but because we were going at a busy time.  I informed them about the system they have where they text you when you table is ready.  Walked up to the podium, gave my information and decided to check out the shops nearby.  

Good thing we were only right next door, because what happened next totally floored me.  When I first went in and gave my name we were told that our wait would be anywhere from 30-45 minutes because we had a party of 5 adults and a child.  While we were browsing the racks in the store my phone rang, not knowing the number I did the typical thing and ignored it.  My phone than rang again and I told my family that I should answer it.  Burgatory went the extra mile here.  It was them that called me and told us our table was ready, not even ten minutes into our wait!  I mean I heard of having to wait longer sometimes, but never under-waiting (is that a word?).

Of course our food was delicious, my little niece was definitely digging the Salty Nutella Crunch shake we ordered.  And who can argue with those crispy mixed potato chips they give you?

Burgatory, you definitely got a customer for life in me."}
{"text":"There is nothing wrong with a gut-busting meal.  Well there may be one thing and that is the need for a nap afterwards.  I'm a big Burgatory fan and have been wanting to try this location since it opened.  Finally had a chance while out with family one day, we actually already decided that we would eat here before we started our day, making it an easy decision since we all agreed ahead of time.

Even though it was during the busy dinner rush we had no wait on being seated.  Shortly thereafter we were greeted by our waitress and drink orders were placed.  I could tell that this was going to be a great experience once that happened.  Nothing like quick, polite service.  Most people would complain about being seated by the kitchen area, but not me.  I actually enjoyed that part of it here.  You could see the kitchen staff busily creating each dish and never faltering.  

Already having it my head that I was going to partake in a gut-busting meal I decided that I would try an appetizer and went with the Adam's Oh No You Didn't Dip.  Such a long name for such a simply dish.  Basically a onion dip made with bacon, horseradish cheddar and cider.  Served with their signature russet/sweet potato chips.  I'm not sure, but I think the ratio of dip to chip was off, or I was just greedy, take your pick on that one.

To stay with the gut-busting theme I decided to order their shake of the day (non-hardened).  That day we were there it was the Unicorn Cake Batter Shake.  Your basic cake batter shake with some blue icing, sprinkles and Lucky Charms marshmallows on top.  It was sweet, but not too sweet.  I love how the cups are basically not big enough to hold this so you get the container it was made in to enjoy the leftovers.

As for my burger of choice this visit, I constructed it myself.  I took out the pencil and pad and went to fast work on creating my masterpiece.  I appreciate that Burgatory has many options for the patty and I almost always try something different when I am there.  This time around I tried the Fiddy-Fiddy.  An eyeopening experience was ahead of me.  How have I never had a burger patty that harmoniously joined together juicy ground beef and that magical bacon (ground up obviously)? ((Side note, your burger will appear pink, but that's because of the bacon))  Bringing myself back to reality from my bacon/beef daydream I continued to check off the boxes to get this bad boy made.  Romaine, check; Smoked Gouda, check; Egg, check; red onion, check; dill pickle chips, check; BACON, check/double check/triple check...BACON!!!  Needless to say I could very well have overdosed on bacon if that is a thing.  I did upgrade my side as I already partook in the chips, I went with the fries.  When this behemoth showed up at the table my jaw dropped, my eyes started to tear up and I had to catch my breath.  I was proud of myself for creating this beauty.  Proud enough not to eat it?  No.  Be happy I took a picture of it before I started to dismantle it.

Happiness is that glazed over look you have after you realize you should have wore sweatpants to dinner."}
{"text":"Loved it. Burgers and shakes were awesome.  A little pricey, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"The manager, Jeremiah,  was wonderful! Service and food were excellent. I will absolutely recommend this restaurant to any and all of my friends and family who visit Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This place gets it right on just about every level.

I love the openness of the space, as well as all of the various accoutrements.  Music that isn't too loud, TVs tuned to every sports channel, and good lighting all make for a very nice experience.

The menu is diverse if you're a burger lover.  Beef, chicken, and even bison and elk are all available.  I was very impressed with the freshness of my item when it came out.  Burger accompaniments are plentiful, and diverse, but in most cases you pay for each one.

The drink menu was well stocked too. Here again however, the cocktails are pricey averaging seven to $10 each.

The service is quite friendly, although there were times when I was left alone a little longer than I should've been.

Overall this is definitely a place I would come back to, even though it is a little overpriced."}
{"text":"I selected the Steakouse burger as appose to assembling my own burger.  Ordered pink and it came out cooked to perfection.  Simply an amazing burger.  I did want to try one of there shaked but I did not have the opportunity too.  I wish they had one of these places in MA!"}
{"text":"I had the crab burger and it was amazing...

The them is not overdone.

The waitress was so spot-on - it was refreshing.

Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Murrsyville food scene! This is a burger place- do not expect anything more. The burgers are delicious and seem fresh. Made to order or menu options are available. Good selection of beer and of course their alcoholic milkshakes! Service is that of a burger joint- this isn't a white glove service type of place, VERY casual. Stop by and try the place BEFORE they get packed at dinner:)"}
{"text":"Sorry, I really did love this place. That was until one time after several times going with my family I was informed that their breads were cooked in animal fat. No, not okay. Educate your staff. My husband and I have been on plant based diets for three years and to be tricked like this isn't cool. They tell you that the fries aren't vegan...they make sure you don't have nut allergies...so why not inform people about your breads? To top it off after finding out that there are only two vegetarian breads, they are out of the vegan option (whole wheat) so I settled for the cheese bread...when I got my food there was bacon on my plate. Just absolutely insulting and just straight up disappointed. Won't be coming back after this."}
{"text":"First experience.  Didn't start smoothly as hostess had poor attitude and wouldn't look us in the eye as she spoke (she did speak so we can't complain about that).  We were seated promptly.   For family of 4, we had professionally made burgers at professional prices.  Will try again!"}
{"text":"We made it back here last night and our experience was even better than the first! Will definitely keep coming back to Burgatory!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, great service, great drinks. I don't think of burgers for dinner, but went with a few other couples and it was a great decision. Had the Morty Burger, Nachos, Strawberry basil drink, and gin/rosemary drink: all were very good. Loved the the burger, nachos, and strawberry basil. Thought the gin/ rosemary was interesting and complex, but a little strange tasting. This was a great experience and I'd recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"We had this place on our radar but weren't able to make it until our last night in Pittsburgh.  It's not too far from the airport where our last hotel was located. One nice feature is you can go on the waitlist through Yelp which I did. This probably saved me about a 20 minute wait. Place itself was nicely decorated and I thought the menu was narrow and to the point. This is a burger place they had several to offer. I ordered the elk burger which was delicious. We also got a Sonoma salad, regular burger, and a quesadilla. Everything was very good. Service was attentive and good without being annoying. They also have a bison burger I would try if I ever come back here."}
{"text":"All I have to say is gorgonzola truffle fries!!!! These babies are bomb.com. There have been days where my fiance and I have gone there for the fries alone because they are that delicious! I'm also a HUGE fan of the Phattie Pattie veggie burger and you can't go wrong with their custom shakes, but PLEASE, NO ONE EVER TELL ME HOW MANY CALORIES ARE IN THEM. Nothing that delicious can be good for you!"}
{"text":"The two times we've been here, my husband and I both experienced symptoms that align with food poisoning. Greasy, and questionable. Just felt like garbage afterwards. 

Also, on our second visit we brought guests from out of town. They couldn't even get out of bed the next day. We felt awful, in more ways than one. 

Will never be back."}
{"text":"Their shakes are amazing! Definitely a huge staple stop in Pittsburgh! I've tried their donut milkshake and the almond torte featuring Pratl's famous almond torte. The almond torte had a unique taste and it wasn't too sweet but tastes exactly like the cake at Pratl's. Heads up: you can ask for hard shakes to be made non-alcoholic!

The burgers are a bit pricey but definitely worth it! They're so filling and offer fresh ingredients that are well prepared. The chips on the side perfectly compliment the meal. I always customize my own burger and I love their unique options!

The staff is friendly and have my friend free chips when her burger came a little late. Be careful that there's usually a huge wait for dinner here and they don't take reservations!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said. Outstanding burgers, should be enough to say.

Went for lunch Saturday of memorial day weekend. Got there at 2 and the place was pretty full with at 15 minute wait for a party of three. But actually got seated in a booth in 10 minutes.
Service was pretty quick, I'd say within 3 minutes or less after seating. Got the drink orders in right away while we looked over the menu and the build your own configuration sheets.
I ordered the standard deluxe with white American, and their own house burger sauce, done pink. I also ordered the fries instead of the chips which come with.
Jody ordered the bison burger and Linda the Crab Shack.
Jody, who has been around and is hard to please gave his an 8 or 9 out of ten. That's a real complement. Linda said she loved the crab shack. Also we had two shakes, one just plain chocolate shake and Linda had the Espresso Love which sounded great and was except it was just kind of too sweet.

Funny thing happened while we were here when the power went out for a few minutes. Just a little added excitement.

Well we will all be coming back here again to try and work our way through the menu and all the options. This place is highly recommended by usens."}
{"text":"We have been to other Burgatory restaurants and really enjoyed our burgers. Here we were asked how we wanted our burgers cooked. I think it was rare, some pink, or no pink.
We asked for some pink similar to what we did in Red Robin and other places who usually ask do you want it done based on the rare, medium, well done standards.
We all asked for some pink, but all our burgers came out cold raw in the middle. Not good.
They were happy to redo but this was just a turnoff. Trying to keep up with the backlog of people waiting, my suspicion is they were cooked too fast, too high a heat, crisp on the outside, raw on the inside.
The remade burgers were just as good as you could hope for. Just wish it would have been done on one take and not two.
Will not fear returning and will do so, if not here then at another location."}
{"text":"I honestly would give this place 3.5 stars. The burgers are very good but not the best burgers I've ever had.  I always get the hormone free beef on brioche. I put spicy mayo and onion straws on it. Don't get me wrong. It's a solid burger but if you made me choose, Five Guys is better. I know that sounds crazy, but just my opinion. 

You get chips with the burgers here, but I chose fries. Bad decision. Fries aren't that great. Chips are just okay as well. So you're probably wondering, why four stars then?  The cleanliness, atmosphere and milkshakes are why. NOBODY beats their milkshakes. And I mean nobody. So much variety and so delicious.  That bumps them from 3 to 4 stars. I like this place. I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"2 words..
IMPOSSIBLE BURGER

Vegan's dream. Everything you could imagine. Plus, you can build your own!

I have been to this location several times, and I am always pleased with fast friendly service, and wonderful high quality food. They have burgers.. yes - but they also have salads, sandwiches, and awesome NACHOS!

I wish they had a larger beer and wine selection, but what they do have is always good and fresh."}
{"text":"First time here and what can I say, the food is awesome and so was our waitress.  The shakes are the bomb, especially with a shot of alcohol in them.  Service was quick once we decided on what we wanted.  The waitress was extremely helpful as I had two different choices picked out and asked her which one of the two she would recommend.
We'll be back again and soon.  My son's birthday is coming up and this is his choice of where he wants to go to eat."}
{"text":"Yum! We're in Pittsburgh for the IFBB North American championship. My boyfriend is competing and got to eat a burger the night before the show so we were on a mission to find something amazing. Burglertory did not let us down! I had the crab burger. It was amazing. So perfectly crispy on the outside, not at all greasy as I expected and so much delicious crab just melting in your mouth. It was served on a white bun(I forgot to ask for a wheat bun and realized after we ordered you could get it on a pretzel bun). It comes with fries or chips but I asked for a side salad which was just as delicious... Mixed greens with fresh shaved gruyere(I think) and roasted tomatoes. Even my boyfriend loves the tomatoes (and he \"hates tomatoes\"). The boy got the meat your maker with the wagyu beef which was better than my crab burger. Omg it was so tender and juicy cooked to perfection. Topped with tomato, cheese, and a few other delicious things I can't remember. Even the fried were cooked to a crisp perfection! 

Definitely happy with our choice of burger joint!

They had a ton a delicious looking shakes but Danny's coach only allowed him chocolate cake or cheese cake for dessert. Only other dessert they had was a chocolate chip cookie sundae so we skipped the dessert portion. Looked good though."}
{"text":"I'd heard really great things about their downtown location from my sister, so my expectations were pretty high for this place. I was excited that it was a build your own burger bar with a veggie burger option, since I'm a vegetarian. 

I love barbecue anything, and it's rare that I get to experience good BBQ as a non-meat eater. I decided to get the veggie burger with a BBQ rub, farmhouse cheddar, BBQ sauce, and grilled onions. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed in the flavor and texture of the burger, I guess I should have guessed that their BBQ wasn't that popular because none of their suggested burgers combinations featured barbecue sauce. I also ordered a s'mores (non-alcoholic) shake that, to me, was just okay. 

My boyfriend got an actual burger that had similar rub/toppings and was also pretty disappointed. 

I think next time I go I will get an already-recommended combo of toppings. I think Burgatory has potential to be delicious, my expectations were just a little too high for my first time."}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers in the city. This place really blew up over the past few years to the point where it might seem overhyped, but I honestly feel like it deserves the praise. The only drawback I can think of is that the prices are kind of high and it can get really busy. Definitely worth checking out though."}
{"text":"Our lunch trio decided to try Burgatory today- it was pretty decent.  Nice atmosphere- we sat at a booth and was promptly waited on.  The server was friendly and efficient.  She made suggestions and was very helpful with answering questions.  I got the veggie burger which is usually a bit of a gamble at most places and this one was ok.  It was a tad mushy but that's not too out of the ordinary for a Veggie burger.  They probably could have used a bit more of oats to hold it together but still was ok.  The staff all seemed pretty friendly and generally looked happy to be there.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The Choco Loco shake was amazing. I ordered the bison burger that was on their menu. I opted to not build my own the first go around. It was basically an ordinary burger. I was a little underwhelmed as the atmosphere when walking in gave me the perception that this place was in another league compared to other burger joints. I saw a few comments about the fries being amazing but I found them a bit plain. My gf bought the steak burger. She said the burger was good but there was way to many onion straws that overwhelmed and drew attention away from the actual burger. Server was Kristy. She was great. Had an awesome smile and was patient with us. We will come again."}
{"text":"This place was so interesting because you could create your own burger! The quality of the ingredients was great, though I should warn you that the buns are incredibly thick. The milkshakes were genuine good and the quantity was plentiful. Also, be aware that switching out the side of chips for fries costs money."}
{"text":"Need better description for their shakes. I was thinking I'd get a vanilla ice cream shake and what I got was a vanilla soda shake. I was quite disappointed and it was an expensive shake. The server asked how I wanted the meat and I specifically said NO PINK. I was given a pink burger. They had to take back the food and the whole lunch experience was shot down. My husband ate his food while I kept waiting for mine. The sweet potato chips lack the sweet potato flavor because they are soaking in oil. My husband got fries (regular) and they weren't so great."}
{"text":"We had heard such great things about the food here so decided to try it this trip to Pittsburgh. Upon arriving the hostess stared at us for probably 15 seconds and never spoke, I finally said hello and she continued to stare. My husband intervened (I'm typically much more hot headed than he is) he asked her if there was a problem and it's customary to be greeted by the HOSTESS!  She argued telling him that every once in awhile the customer should greet her. Needless to say she continued with her rude behavior and finally had someone else seat us. The restaurant was very warm and we were seated in an area which is I suppose used for indoor/outdoor. Our waitress was friendly but could have explained things better being this was our first time there and she was aware of this. The food like I said was good and had we been treated a little better upon arrival we would have returned on the next trip but I think we'll just leave it as one and done. To the management this event occurred on Wednesday July 19th, 2017 so you may want to get the hostess lined out before she ruins others experience as well."}
{"text":"Kept hearing about how great the burgers and shakes are at this place.  Every time I would stop by the place was jammed, so I finally went at 3:00 in the afternoon.

Yes, the burgers are top quality and prepared exactly as ordered.  Sorry, but the shakes are ridiculously overpriced and really nothing special.

Interior was that of a typical hamburger joint, but the restrooms are a joke.  Extremely small and not real clean."}
{"text":"The \"impossible\" burger is what took us to Burgatory this time. This is a 100% vegetarian burger made out of wheat and potatoes, that apparently makes it the closest thing to eating meat. What sets it apart from other veggie pattys is an ingredient called 'heme', sourced from soy root which is what gives it its meat-like texture/flavor. This is the 'vegetarian burger that bleeds' and in Pittsburgh, is only available at Burgatory. While my boyfriend absolutely loves it and will go back again and again for the impossible burger, I prefer going back to Burgatory for their other vegetarian (less meat-like) burger options. All in all, we love Burgatory for different reasons (or burgers). Their cocktails are on point and shakes, epic! Servers are always friendly and efficient. I love the outdoor patio at their north shore location and it's become an after-work happy hour favorite for me!"}
{"text":"Great place with an interesting menu.  We have been trying to eat here for a while and the wait has always been at least 30 minutes which pushed us down to the 5 guys next door.  It is very good and there are some interesting items other than burgers.  Also liked the shakes and you can ad alcohol to them"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a custom burger place you should give it a try. The food is usually pretty good. Normally the wait is not very long and the service is good."}
{"text":"I this world seemingly faster, cheaper low quality food, I was pleasantly surprised during my recent visit. I ordered the uncle mortey's burger and I have to tell you that it might have been the best burger that I ever had. Meat done perfectly,  bun so tasty and fresh.  Just one awsome experience!"}
{"text":"It only took one visit to this restaurant to conclude that it would FOREVER be the first place that we would take out-of-towners. The waitstaff is lively, on top of orders and drinks, knowledgeable of the menu, and a bit cheeky. Even the most outlandish menu items are surprisingly delicious and not just a chef's joke on patrons. :) If it sounds weird, give it a try...the flavor/texture combinations are more expertly thought-out than one would anticipate from a burger joint! I recommend the PB&J burger with a toasted s'more milkshake! Don't plan on finishing it, though :D"}
{"text":"Tried this as a suggested venue for a visit with our kids after their flight home from vacation. Landed here on a Friday night at the end of happy hour so waitress hustled us to order drinks and apps before the cut-off time.  The guacamole was exceptional but the onion rings were so, so.  I am particular about onion rings and while the dip was tasty the rings were tasteless and chewy, which happens when the green layer of the onion isn't taken away.  I like to taste the onion.

I made my own burger:  bison -pink-naked. It was barely pink on the inside and had burnt crispy edges not to my liking. Bison tends to be dry so ordered horseradish cream but it was to thin and looked like they poured a tablespoon of milk over my burger. There was no horseradish flavor either. My burger was served with chips - so browned they tasted burnt so couldn't eat them. 

I did not complain because it took SO long to get our meal we thought the waitress had forgotten us and I didn't want our party to have to wait for my food.  I used the dip from the onion rings to disguise the dryness and crispy edged taste of my burger. We didn't stay to order dessert. 

The Hubs had the wagu burger and said it was just ok, nothing special, and not cooked the way he requested. 

I must say we had 1 person at our table who has severe allergies and the staff was accommodating and able to answer questions made to satisfaction."}
{"text":"I would eat there again if in the area but I wouldn't make a trip down from Cranberry.  To be honest, I was expecting to be blown away and ended up being unimpressed.  Of course, I had to make out like it was wonderful, as my co-worker said Purgatory's hamburgers were better than the gourmet burger shop we have up here.  But it wasn't, not by a long shot.  I got the hormone free beef, which is supposed to be a mixture of 4 different cuts.  The burger shop up here does that, and they are great.  But this was not so much. Just not a lot of flavor.  I didn't order it with any rub because I didn't see anything that appealed to me, but some salt and pepper would have been nice.  The toppings were fresh, and the bun was decent.  But otherwise, the meat just didn't wow me like I've had elsewhere.

On the plus side, I enjoyed the beer selection, and the beans were excellent.  I'd just like a big bowl of those!!  But overall, not a bad hamburger, about like a Five Guys. Just not what I expected with all the hype the place has.  Guess I'm going to the local gourmet burger shop for lunch today!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, delicious burgers made just how we requested. Shakes are huge and soooo good. Kids in our group were happy with their selections. Fortune cookies were fun! If you are in a hurry-you will be frustrated-service slow. If you have the time-it is worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I always get their custom build burger. I usually either go with bison or elk. The choices are endless and I have never had a bad burger. Their shakes are okay, once in awhile I'll get one but they're nothing special in my opinion. I was slightly disappointed with my experience last night. It started out great. My friend and I sat at the bar we didn't want to wait an hour when they had plenty of tables opened,which I hate about that place.  We waited for our check for close to an hour. Finally we had to yell for our check then I hardly had drank my shake and I had to wait 10 more minutes and yell for a to go cup. The last half of my experience is why I only gave this place 3 stars for crap service . Food is 5 stars."}
{"text":"We were in town for a baseball game, had time to kill, and stopped in here to eat some lunch. Beyond grateful that we did. The Pommes Frites, to die for, we did the Truffled Gorgonzola flavor. I could have eaten the whole tin by myself and been happy that was my meal. 

Ultimately we did burgers and they were cooked just as we requested and very good but honestly nothing incredibly special or memorable until we asked our server what the rubs were and what works best with those. My wife would tell you, her burger was awesome and it's all because of the rub recommendation she got.   

So what was truly memorable was our waitress. Service is something of a premium these days and Jennifer was one of the best we ever had. She was attentive, answered all our questions, and was as friendly as you could be, even after we told her we were here to cheer on the rival sports team. :)

When you go to Heinz Field or PNC Park (and you should a beautiful ballpark by the way), just down the block is the Burgatory.  Parking is easy on the street if you go early enough. Otherwise , if it's right before the game there is the lot right behind the restaurant. Use the west entrance (a little tip Jennifer gave us), that's for everyone parking not just leases. 

I don't know that Pittsburgh would be somewhere we would frequent and these burger spots are only in the steel city but I do know if we do go back, we are going to Burgatory and asking for Jennifer."}
{"text":"I love their Yin Yang chicken burger. I have had it multiple times. I tried their caramel pretzel shake too. That was simplt awesome. A must try.
I will return back for good food and service.
I am giving this place 4 starts because every time I had to wait for at least 45 mins in the waiting line.. No other reason."}
{"text":"Nice sit down spot in Blue Spruce Plaza with either dining or bar seating and a decent amount of TVs. Nice beer and cocktail selection with knowledgeable bartenders. Food is delicious, and obviously extremely customizable as you essentially get to build your own burger. For appetizers, my go to choices are whatever type of wing they are currently offering, typically a honey siracha type, or the Fork It Fries with short rib, cheese curd, and gravy. I typically opt for the chicken burger, but have friends who go with elk, salmon, or traditional beef and all thoroughly enjoy them. The milkshakes are awesome as well and you can get them traditional, or spiked (alcohol added). Must visit!"}
{"text":"Nice location. Crowded. Lots of choice for your burger since you can create your own. Prices were just fine. Didn't think it was outstanding, however. Decent place!"}
{"text":"What an amazing burger place! Burgatory will meet all your cravings to the tee and more! The staff is excellent, the setting just right, and the food was beyond what I could have hoped for! 

When I arrived for dinner at 7 pm on a Friday night, it was crowded and close to an hour wait. I downloaded an app though that alerted me how many groups were in front of me and that was super helpful. The wait ended up being only 25 minutes! We were seated and waited on efficiently. There is a custom creation check-off sheet which made it super easy to get what you wanted how you wanted it. I ordered a simple barbecue chicken sandwich and it turned out amazing! I recommend ordering a milkshake to go instead of with your meal, or else you may end up uncomfortably full. At the end of my dinner, I ordered a caramel pretzel milkshake, weary how the combination of flavors would taste, and it turned out amazing. The next day, I was just craving for another caramel and pretzel shake! 

I was traveling out of state and the Burgatory has been on my mind since I got home. But next time I am traveling towards Pittsburgh, I am looking forward to go to this amazing burger place!"}
{"text":"This is a fine place for a burger and shake -- overpriced to me ($10 basic burger) and trying a little too hard, but the burger was cooked as I ordered it, service was reasonably prompt and courteous, and the atmosphere is ok. I had the Farmer Brown, which has an egg and bacon. It's all right, but not juicy and drippy like a truly awesome burger. The meat was as I said cooked to the right temperature but somehow they dried it out. 

was unthrilled by the hostess trying to put me at a high top in an almost empty restaurant without asking, but she complied quickly when I objected. It gets four stars primarily because I'm grading on a curve -- it's in a real desert and is by far the best choice among a hundred terrible chains like Ditka's and tgi Friday's."}
{"text":"First time here, I had the bison burger. I really couldn't tell the difference in the meat, considering all the things I put on it. Whole wheat Mustard horseradish cheese(something like that). It was very good though."}
{"text":"A week or two ago, I posted a small complaint on their facebook page regarding the taste and way they modified the bangkok steak fries since the first time I tried it, three days after their opening.  As you can see from my first review (and picture), the bangkok steak fries didn't have the most picture perfect presentation, but were lightly battered, and fried just right, so that the taste of the mushroom came out and wasn't overpowered by the batter.  after that first time, however, they started overwhelming those poor mushrooms with batter: some of the batter towards the inside wasn't even fried, and part of the batter wasn't even mixed well enough, leaving patches of raw flour, which tasted terrible and, obviously overpowered and destroyed the appeal of the appetizer.

They did answer my facebook post very quickly, offering a complimentary order the next time I went.  Before my next visit yesterday, my friend, who I usually go to Burgatory with, visited the restaurant before I did with his friend, and was pleased to report to tell me that they had reverted back to their original way of creating this tasty appetizer.  

when i proudly got to show this pittsburgh establishment off to my girlfriend yesterday evening, we were greeted by the same friendly staff, and very shortly after being seated, by the owner.  he immediately mentioned that he was ready to serve us an order of bangkok steak fries, but was very gracious when I kindly asked whether i could defer it to my next visit (which will be soon, i assure you all).  my girlfriend had ordered a caramel pretzel milkshake, and given how much of my milkshake i could finish the last time i ordered one, i knew that she wouldn't have space in her stomach to enjoy the bangkok steak fries.  the caramel pretzel shake was delicious: as my girlfriend said \"pretzels in a milkshake is genius!\"  be warned though, don't drink it too fast, despite its deliciousness. the pretzel bits can fly down the wrong tube pretty easily.  just savor the flavor. :)

my main reason for giving my 2nd update review for this joint is to mention their supremacy in creating the best \"standard\" burger i've ever tasted.  despite its simplicity in construction - beef patty, crisp iceberg lettuce, tomato, one whole onion slice, and their house sauce which i can only liken to a liquidy version of in n out's \"special sauce\" - the taste of every ingredient comes out so incredibly cleanly and potently.  the strong punch of the onion, the texture of the fresh lettuce and tomato, the milky white american cheese on the perfectly seared-in juicyness of the beef patty. my goodness. i've already ordered this cheapest non-custom burger twice in a row now!  so don't be turned off by the lack of complexity in this burger, assuming that the taste won't be as satisfying as a morty steakhouse. i assure you that you'll be just as satisfied.  my girlfriend also wanted to try the japapeno cornbread; when she ordered it, the waiter asked if she'd like to substitute it in place of her potato chips.  this was only 1 dollar extra.  so if you're not super obsessed with the chips and want to try their other sides, try asking for a substitution, and they may very well allow it!  by the way, the same 1 dollar extra sub works with fries as well.

thumbs up, as always, for great service and great food."}
{"text":"They have the most delicious shakes in the world. The caramel pretzel is amazing.  There can be a long wait on weekend evenings, but they have a pretty nice system of texting your cell before your table is ready so you can go browsing shops.
The restaurant's theme and ordering form are amusing, and the food happens to be good too.  It's just that consuming a burger and a milkshake will make you feel the way a person who just ingested 3,000 calories feels."}
{"text":"I literally had a dream about the shortrib sandwich last night. I think it's called the Get Shorty or something similar, but let me tell you: it was divine. Melty, toasty, meaty goodness. It comes with au jus for dipping, and the sandwich is big enough for someone with a small appetite to take half home and enjoy later (good cold or reheated). Milkshakes are on. point. When I ate in the restaurant, I had a smores milkshake, which was excellent, and had a plain Jane chocolate when I drove home - equally delicious. 

I had this for the first time when I was in the area for work, and convinced myself that stopping for to-go on my way home from the same trip was a great idea. Made for a great lunch when I needed to stop for gas, and the milkshake is a great way to pamper yourself when you're in for a long haul and don't want to think about calories. When I picked up, they had an option for car-side pick up, but I went in. Nice to have the choice though."}
{"text":"Great food!
I was in town for business, and this restaurant was fairly close to my hotel and had good reviews, so I decided to try it. 
When I came in around 7pm, the restaurant was pretty packed, but I didn't have to wait to be seated. However, I had to wait a little to get service. 

I glanced the menu and decided to build my own burger and get a side of onion rings (See my picture for my burger). My onion rings came first and were very crispy, and I loved the sauce. 
My burger was perfectly cooked. The patty was pink inside and all toppings were very good. Overall, the food was great. 

Why 4 stars? The service was slow. It was hard to get attention. The staff was nice. 
The portions were huge! It's not cheap (appetizers are a little pricey), but I think it's fair for the burgers you get. I didn't get shake because I was stuffed, and it would be too much sugar, but I would like to try one next time.
Other than that, my experience was good. I would come back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"The veggie burger and crab burger are amazing. I don't like the chips they come with so I always upgrade to a side salad which is also amazing. I haven't been there in a very long time just because of how busy it always seems to be and because I tend to forget it's there because it's tucked in the corner."}
{"text":"Great service and the crab burger was great. It was the best option I could find for myself but I will say it was tasty.  It still was not the best Crab I have had but overall the place is good if you are into burgers and fries."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Burgatory for their unique burgers, shakes, freshly made cocktails, and fun atmosphere. They have great Create Your Own burger options with different meats, including dry age Wagyu, and options for veggie lovers like a homemade veggie burger with lentils, mushrooms, cashews and cracked wheat. 

I always opt for the scratch-made margarita or sangria to accompany my Wagyu burger. I'm a spice lover and the Buffalo cheddar, sriracha remoulade, and spicy ketchup don't disappoint. They also offer dry rubs and unique toppings like bacon jam and truffled shallot aioli.

My husband's favorite part about burgatory is the dessert. Whether it's the Campfire S'mores shake or Ginormous chocolate chip cookie sundae  (which has has eaten by myself), you can't go wrong. Enjoy!

So why 3 stars? I will say that the north shore location's service isn't as stellar as the original Fox Chapel location. Bar service is slow and they messed up my order (which was for an allergy... serious stuff). Otherwise, still delicious. We did have to constantly ask for drink refills, even water. He never automatically filled our drinks. This would never happen at the Fox Chapel location!"}
{"text":"An allergen-free/gluten-free update:

I am ecstatic to say that Burgatory now has gluten free buns for the burgers! Not only are they GF, but also egg, soy and dairy free! This is extremely exciting considering I had not had a burger with a bun in almost 2 years. Hurray!

I'll reinforce my previous reviews of Burgatory and state that they continue to take care of customers with food allergies with great care. I have been here dozens of times and I have never gotten sick once. The customer service and food is one of a kind. I'm happy to call Fox Chapel home so I can go get this burger any time I want, with a bun to boot!!"}
{"text":"Huge Fan !!! Katelyn is the best server !! 
Burgers are fantastic but the best was the Old Grand Shake !! 
Highly recommend!! 
Will return most definitely."}
{"text":"Since moving back to the Burgh after many years away, I have been intrigued to try this burger joint. A big draw I'll admit was the name and concept of the place itself. Admittedly not much of a meat eater, I do on the rare occasion develop a hankering for a burger. I have always gone to five guys when this happens. However today I finally had the opportunity to try Burgatory. I was very disappointed. My burger was less than okay; I did not enjoy it at all and only took a few bites. In the future I will stick with Five Guys."}
{"text":"This is possibly the best burger joint in pittsburgh. I recently visited Burgatory that just opened in the Waterfront and I was not disappointed. The line was long and out the door during dinner hours on a Thursday. We had to take two open seats at the bar and received excellent service from our bartender. She was attentive and took our orders promptly. The burgers came out just the way we ordered and the jalapeno fries had a nice kick to it. I would definitely come back again...probably this weekend. :D"}
{"text":"Great burgers and shakes... The wait staff was amazing, especially Cin. She was so sweet and on the ball with any and all our request. My only issue isn't even a big one... But, I would of liked my burger seasoned heavier."}
{"text":"The meal was close to $50 for two burgers and their poutine appetizer. I got the wagyu burger with ham and cheddar and it was pretty good. The poutine wasn't that good though I thought, the beef on top and the watery gravy didn't do it for me, especially when the beef had chunks of fat and bone in it. I might come back, but doubt it. For the drive from my house to this place I'd rather drive to Cleveland and eat at BSpot, it's half the price and a better burger in my opinion."}
{"text":"I ordered a custom beef burger with \"No Pink.\" The burger shown in the attached photo is what I received. Unquestionably, bright pink. 

I called the waitress over and told her about the error. She told me they could take my current burger and throw it back on the grill or they could make me a new burger. I asked for a new burger because I had already cut into the other one and it was covered in messy toppings. About 5 minutes later, the manager comes over to the table and apologizes for the burger being \"slightly pink\" and informs me that my new burger will take 17-20 minutes to make, which totally threw me off guard. The waitress never mentioned the ridiculous amount of time it would take to make the new burger - if she had I would have just thrown the old one on the grill.

My husband had already received his meal at that point, so I asked the  manager if there was any way to cook the burger faster than 20 minutes (considering there was no one waiting to sit down and several tables in the restaurant were empty). The manager told me she could \"fly\" the burger, but it might not have all the toppings that I originally asked for - basically, I wouldn't get what I ordered for the second time.

My husband had cleaned his plate by the time I received mine and I was forced to ask for it in a To-Go box because we had somewhere to be. The restaurant comped my burger, but the experience was so frustrating."}
{"text":"I know burgers are the thing now and I've been to many of the \"gourmet\" burger places.   Burgatory really shines in the category.   The burger was perfectly seasoned and cooked and the choice of toppings was excellent.  Now it would be nice if they came to the Tampa area."}
{"text":"Mediocre foot and even worse service.  Went there during a football sunday and the place was half full.  Got sat outside, and it took 30 min before we were even acknowledged by a server, after I had to walk in and ask for someone.  After we ordered it took twice as long for us to even get your food.  Could probably get an equivalent burger at mcd's so don't wast your time."}
{"text":"This location is located on the little strip near PNC park.

Elk burger was delightful, instead of the spicy rub I decided to go with the garlic rub...nice touch. Fries were hot and crispy, perfectly seasoned. If you want to get real funky they have a create your own list which was pretty elaborate. I also noticed that some people came in specifically for milk shakes which being that it's not really around anything tells me they must be good."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic experience. I've been to a build-your-own burger place, but not one that had such a variety of options that were also unique. And none that had menus to write on. 
I had a vegan milkshake and it wasn't made vegan the first time, but they caught the error and immediately made me a new one that was a milkshake and a half. I had to share it there was so much. 
Definitely in my top 3 of burger places."}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch with my wife after a long day of new car buying. Place was pretty busy. Always a good sign. Was seated immediately.  Service was friendly and helpful. Waitress recommendation was actually good ( not the typical \"everything's good here\"). 

I had the steakhouse burger and the special shake called a Samoa shake with Carmel chocolate and coconut. Like the Girl Scout cookie. Both were done as I ordered and were excellent. Food was plentiful and I had trouble finishing shake and that's unusual.   Glad I didn't get an appetizer. Ill be back!"}
{"text":"a huge fan of the burger, I had to try Burgatory.  I loved it so much in fact that I went 2x in the same week. The build your own burger is a great idea with a ton of unconventional condiments that you wont see at just any burger shack. I recommend the all natural beef burger on brioche with spicy ketchup, onion straws, farmhouse cheddar cheese, arugula, and the angel dust rub.  If thats not enough reason to go then lets talk about their milkshakes. Spiked or not they are excellent. I had the pretzel milkshake which gives you that sweet and salty combo and then stepped up to their banana foster milkshake spiked with banana liquor among other ingredients.  Burgatory is like Pittsburghs version of Burger Bar in Las Vegas. The only thing I would like to see on the menu in the future is an option for kobe beef."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Burgatory. They have the BEST milkshakes ever!! I have tried all the non alcoholic shakes & they are all amazing! My favorite is the Fluffer Nutter Butter! Every week or so they have a special milkshake that is not on the menu. Those are hit or miss, you never know what the new special will be. Be warned the milkshakes are VERY ADDICTING! 
Now that I've covered dessert first now on to the food. LOL
Their veggie burgers are delicious. I would say probably the best veggie burger I've had. They make them onsite from scratch. The greatest thing is you can build your own burger from scratch. They give you a long list of toppings you can choose from to create your own burger. I like to pick different toppings each time. Their burgers are so huge, there's no way you'll be able to eat it all at one sitting. Also their fresh made potato chips are delicious. 
You're truly missing out if you haven't eaten @ Burgatory. It doesn't really matter which one you eat at, I think they're all equally as good."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Burgatory...burgers where you can pick your own toppings, as much or as little as you want..and finish it off with an OMG so freakin good milkshake!! I actually already wrote a review for Burgatory Homestead location..but this place is so good I figured I'd write another review for a different location. I have eaten at all the locations and they are all equally as good. There's no difference between the locations, so no matter which location you eat at you'll get the same great food and service. 
I've only had the veggie burger so I can't speak for the other burgers but their veggie burger is the best I've had anywhere. My favorite toppings are pineapple with fried onions or sometimes an egg. Their burgers are huge and extremely filling. Usually only able to eat half at a time. 
You can not leave Burgatory without ordering a milkshake. I always order them to go because once again their milkshake are huge too. They have some of the best milkshakes I've had anywhere. 
Burgatory is totally addictive...once you eat here you'll be hooked and you'll just crave their food!!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of great things about Burgatory from Pittsburghers and decided to give it a try. I'm not a milkshake person, so I didn't get that. The review suggest they are to die for. Perhaps, I'll try it next time when I have a little more room in my tummy. My burger- Meat Your Maker-- was good. Based on the reviews and feedback from others, I was expecting a lot more."}
{"text":"Very good!  They need to work on their \"no wait\" a little. I put our name in and it said 20 min wait, my daughter got there before us and said we were on \"no wait\", she was told at LEAST 1 hr - 1 hr 30 min wait, that the app was wrong. Never mind, we went somewhere else."}
{"text":"This my son's favorite restaurant, and it just opened in our area. We were able to call and check wait times took advantage of an app to place us on the waiting list. When we arrive the wait was about five minutes on Mother's Day thanks to planning ahead.

Drinks were orders and they arrived quickly including the milkshakes. Dinner was a bit of a wait. Three out of four of us were happy with the meal. One burger ordered pink arrived well-done. Also, fire roasted tomatoes were just tomatoes warmed not really roasted. Chips were crisp, but lacked some seasoning and the potato salad was underwhelming. I will ordered the side salad in the future. Customer service was great the well-done burger was taken off the bill, so props for making good on the mistake."}
{"text":"They've got a vegan burger option, so it's a great place to take people who aren't vegan and not super into straying really far from American fare.  Convenient location to my home for quick walks down and a decent drinks at fair prices, too."}
{"text":"VERY VERY VERY BAD SERVICE - they have 6-7 hostesses & the manager was not aware of the conflict of seating the 11 of us. Waited 2 hours & were told a lot of differing stories & no one told us the same thing twice!  Burgers are good, but not worth the confusion & craziness of a disorganized staff."}
{"text":"OK. I was naturally excited about this new burger joint, because people kept raving about it. I thought to myself, this is something I have to try. I kept trying to drop in on the place before and after movies and the place consistently had at least a 45 minute wait to be seated. So...it took a good long time before I actually got to sit down and eat there.

So did it live up to the hype???  NOT AT ALL.

I ordered there most basic burger, hoping to taste the quality of the meat and how well it was cooked. Just like most red blooded American Males, I'm very serious about my burgers. I was disgusted with this burger and the fries. Note: I did not order any special rubs or hoopla of any sorts. I wanted to see what they were working with. The burger itself was disgustingly sweet. The only thing I could compare it to was Nutmeg. YEA, a meat patty doused in Nutmeg. It was gross. Same for the fries, they were also dusted with this foul concoction. It was an unpalatable mess.

People are still raving over it. I don't get it. There are better places to get burgers in the city.

The place is straight-up unimpressive."}
{"text":"Updating my review. Food is insanely good (the \"fresh greens\" ... oh, my. It's literally the best thing I've ever tasted.) and the staff is so warm and friendly. When I mentioned I had a mild allergy to something, they went about and beyond to explain what items were completely safe. So great!"}
{"text":"This is not your average burger joint. Build your own burger and make it exactly how you want it, then end your meal with an out of this world milkshake. I recommend the smores. (A little on the expensive side, but worth it every once in a while). The servers are very friendly and the atmosphere is cool and hip."}
{"text":"Everything was freaking awesome. Burgers were complete fire, shake was crazy good and a huge portion. All the apps were fire flame as well. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"I heard great things about these burgers so when I went to a Pens game I gave it a shot. Way overrated & overpriced. I've had better burgers at my house. Don't see the big deal."}
{"text":"We simultaneously looked at each other, having just taken our first bite, eyes widened, and we said, \"we're never going to BRGR again!\" 

You can build your own burger, ordering each component from a pre-printed sheet, kind of like ordering sushi. Choose a meat, a rub, a sauce, cheese, and toppings (some free, like organic greens; and some $1, like onion strings), and cooking temperature. Alternately, there's several pre made options available, including one I definitely plan on trying that's topped with an over easy egg. 

We also ordered their Buffalo wings, and, of course, spiked shakes. Buffalo wings were great-- nice and crispy with a nicely spicy sauce. The spiked shakes might be where BRGR wins. I got the salted nutella shake, and added vanilla vodka. The shakes come topped with a *a lot* of home-made whipped cream, and there are big chunks of chocolate candy in the shake. Both of those things tasted good, but I wanted a smooth shake, and there was just too much whipped cream for my taste. 

Also, on Saturdays they have exotic meat burgers, and they update their website each week so that you can know when you can get that Python burger you've been craving!"}
{"text":"Love finding tasty, creative burger places. Service was good. Milkshakes are a MUST DO! Followed a lot of other yelpers reviews - help us make the right choice :)"}
{"text":"Yuck -- I waited 40 minutes for my food, which came out cold. Sent it back and it came out with incredibly skimpy toppings, which cost extra. They had to bring me more in a separate dish. After all that they couldn't even comp a glass of wine? Will not go back and told the server as much. She said she wouldn't blame me and gave me other recommendations."}
{"text":"Ok, first off, you can put your name on the waiting list with the yelp app. I was suspect but it works flawlessly!  I bookmarked Burgatory for our Pirates game trip and there was no disappointment. 

I had an undiscloseable amount of Yuengling on draft and the Piggy Butter & Jelly was the most strangely awesome thing that I have eaten in a long time. No joke, it's wonderful. Candied Bacon, peanut butter, habanero jelly, etc. on a burger, WHAT? So good!

Kids liked the mini burgers and quesadilla. My wife actually had an alcoholic milkshake (I was shocked) was really really good (choco taco milkshake). 

A bit higher than most places we go but it was awesome. Local to Pittsburgh with 6 locations and soon to be 7. GO THERE!"}
{"text":"It's called Burgatory for a reason.  Definitely order one of there amazing burger options and do it from the custom check lists on the table.   Their seasoning options, toppings, etc are outstanding and so fresh.   I have tried all the meat options and have never been disappointed.   

Fries vs in house chips - CHIPS!  (Especially with their spicy ketchup!)   

Milkshakes - I am lactose intolerant, so I have not been able to enterain.  However, when my friends/family get them, they always look amazing and they always rave about them.   

Service - has always been outstanding - the staff is so friendly and helpful. 

My only complaints are 1. the chili is very bland 2. the onion rings are always soggie and gross 

Definitely hit it up though!  Whenever I am home in Pittsburgh, it is a must stop."}
{"text":"Man... I don't make a lot of reviews but I felt the need to post something.

First, I don't have anything negative to say regarding the service or the atmosphere. Everything was just fine in that particular area. My issue is with the food experience. I've only been to this restaurant a couple times but there hasn't been an instance where I've come away satisfied with the quality of the food. I don't get it! I'm not a picky eater but I just haven't enjoyed it.

My first visit included a bison burger that I was unimpressed with. I'd much rather go to Five Guys or Smashburger. I did, however, enjoy the milkshake that I ordered.

On my second visit I had one of their sandwiches and again I came away disappointed. STILL... this place is always busy! What could I be doing wrong?? I'm debating another try but I think I'm going to give it some time before I do."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting this place while in the 'Burg....and it was just as good. Natural beef burger on a normal bun, angel dust seasoning, bacon and the works, put me out. I think next time I'll do a little pink to make it a little more juicy, but that \"mistake\" was on me. 

We got there within an hour of closing, which I hate doing...but these crazy highways can get you lost and if you miss a turn, you are f'd--anyway, we didn't feel rushed at all. My bro had some burger with an over easy egg, a shake with liquor and he's ready to go back. Location is bomb being right by the stadium, so we might make that happen pre-game. It's legit!"}
{"text":"30min wait at 5:00pm on Saturday \"night\". Thought we'd beat the rush. LOL.. We like that they text when table is ready so we can shop. Angelica was our server and she was attentive and friendly. Carmel pretzel shake is the best! Kids cleared their plates."}
{"text":"The chips aren't cooked fresh, so they are stale, the home style fries are not good either , not fresh or crisp

THE MUSIC IS PLAYED VERY LOUD 

I liked the quinoa salad, spicy ketchup and creative options for dining but even the cornbread was a let down

The music is overpowering. We've been here 3 times and had the  same problems ...it won't be any different sadly 


ITS VERY LOUD IN HERE 

Drinks were watered down. Don't let the word\" craft\" fool you.  Their liquor selection is very limited ..they used scant strawberries in the muddled drink..it was not good 

Go to tender in Lawrenceville  for amazing craft cocktails"}
{"text":"The location near Robinson is the easiest for me to get to as I do a lot of flying out of the airport. When it opened, I couldn't understand why people flocked there until I tried it for myself months ago. I'm hooked. 

My burger of choice is the Morty's Steakhouse. Medium rare, peppercorn patty with haystack onion straws, BBQ sauce, grilled onions, and cheese. So good it's scandalous. I get it with the house chips and gorge on goodness like the glutton I am. They do a really good job of cooking to order on the burger and they taste juicy every time. 

I've only eaten in once so I can't speak to the service. It wasn't bad from what I remember. The people who have taken my order for to-go service have all been polite and fast. It usually takes around 20 minutes to get my food. It's always packed at this particular location with a long wait so I don't bother eating in. I don't seem to be much for eating in anyway. 

I love this place and wish desperately it was in more places. I flew in from California and this was the first place I wanted to go after I landed. 3 months pining for a good burger has to mean something.

Ps: the milkshakes are to die for!"}
{"text":"If you love burgers and shakes this is your place. We've been here three times. Each time we come in town we make sure we make it. We do the \"create your own\" burgers they're always prepared perfectly.  Make sure you try the grilled cheese sandwich. It's on the kids menu its seriously the best grilled cheese we've ever had. Aaaamazing. The service is a bit slow and the fries have never been a highlight but overall everything is delicious. We will for sure come back every time we're in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"First.  Killer food, great beer selection and friendly staff.  Unfortunately located in the urban sprawl of Robinson.

Anyway, I had a group in on Sunday evening, Sept. 1, 2013.  When we arrived, we were told the wait would be 30-40 minutes.  At about an hour, we checked in with the hostess who admitted accidentally giving part of our table away (we had 8 people).  We continued to wait, patiently, not complaining, just hanging out having a beer (two of us in our group had many years of restaurant experience, so we know that shit happens sometimes).  The bartender offered us a round on the house and the manager offered us a free appetizer with our meal.  Jimmy and the staff that night were great and definitely made up for the mistake and our delayed dinner.

This place is owned by the same guys that own Fuel and Fuddle - one of my favorite Pittsburgh restaurants that holds many great memories from my college days at PITT.  As with F& F, the food at Burgatory was killer!  We'll definitely be back the next time we're in the Burgh!  Thanks again!"}
{"text":"First I must confess my lack of a five star rating is only due to the always rediculously long wait times (90+ minutes during busy times). I'd recommend trying for lunch as they open (11am) or early (5ish) dinner. 

Too many options and variations to list from the build your own burger menu. All I can say is that unless you make bad choices, nothing you chose will be disappointing. Meats are all high quality, as are the toppings. The sides I've tried are all solid and the milkshakes... Well if you still have room they are fantastic."}
{"text":"Holy burger.   I have been here twice and the food is well worth the trip.  First, the appetizer - a take on poutine.   Fries, gravy, cheese curds, with some rosemary braised short ribs.   Amazing.   Lots of meat  and just the right balance of herbs, salt, and cheese curd.   I ordered it both times even though I knew how big the burgers are.    

Which brings me to the burgers.    The first one I had was the Meat Your Maker.   I wasn't sure about this one, but it was great.  The meat was tender and juicy, and the toppings were a nice tangy compliment.   My choice on the second trip was the Elk Gone Wild.  This one was also good, though definitely a little overpowered by the toppings.   The bacon onion jam was the main flavor in the dish.   Both were messy, so this is maybe not a first date kind of place.  Homemade chips on the side completed each dish.    

Next time, I will try the milkshakes, which looked amazing.  Maybe split a burger to justify fitting that in.  

Four stars instead of five because our server was in la-la land both times.  No personality, slow service, slow on the refills, didn't know the menu, etc."}
{"text":"The shakes are super good!  I really love the caramel pretzel one and they make a mean plain vanilla one too.  Burgers are typically pretty good: I love to create my own.  Some of the \"upcharges\" don`t make too much sense though. Service is typically not the best though, which is why I gave 3 stars.  I`ve been to Burgatory 4 or 5 times, and have never had great service.  I keep going back though because of the cool vibe and great eats.  I was disappointed last time I was there to find that they didnt have Wi-Fi... really?  Overall, the food is pretty tasty and the shakes... yum!"}
{"text":"This place like all burgatorys is fantastic. The food is spot on and the wait staff is top notch. We had a small problem with my wife's burger and it was fixed without issue and fixed fast. The manager even took the burger off the the check which was not expected. We will be back for sure! Thanks for a great date night!!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night with friends and we were so confused because no where on the menu does it mention French fries just \"chips.\" My only advice is to add that to the menu because we almost left and went next door to BJ's for a burger a fries. I ended up ordering the burger with crab which was SO GOOD! I'm blanking on the name of it, but definitely ask about it! I also love how they have a customize your own burger option, gives a lot of flexibility with people ordering. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I love burgers. Love them. I've had them all over the US and the world! From  Alaska and California to prime cattle country in Alberta to the american heartland and NYC and beyond. Had them in Asia, South America, Latin America, all over Europe, Africa and Mexico (don't ever recommend them there). In fact, if I can be so bold, I'm gonna lay claim to being a burger EXPERT. So when I hear about how great Burgatory is, I'm intrigued.  And when I go to a place like this, I'm ordering burgers -not exotic milkshakes or truffle fries or some distraction. Nope. Gimme the burger. 

Now, with that said, these are just not that good. I know, you're appalled. But Gary, you say, how can that be? Look at all the rave reviews!! Here's a clue. Check the reviews more closely and you'll note that people mostly rave about the spectacular shakes, not the burgers. And I'm just not interested in shakes - pretty much anytime. 

Sure the menu is cool, build your own or pre made options like the  Morty's steakhouse I ordered or even the jerk chicken one my wife ordered. The beef is a \"succulent blend\" of angus sirloin, brisket and short rib. Sounds like it should be full of flavor. Sadly it's not. In fact it was uniquely bland and uninspired. Morty's says it has horseradish cheddar ( no evidence), Cabernet sauce (no evidence) and onion straws. Tons of straws but I couldn't detect an onion particle in any of them. So I'm profoundly disappointed. My wife's burger was equally tasteless. There are far better burger options throughout the city. I suggest going elsewhere. Unless you want a shake."}
{"text":"I'm a burger lover, and this place is heaven. I went here twice in 2 consecutive days, lol. My first visit I order the Farmer Brown with pink meat. The burger came with a slice of ham and an egg. It was delicious. Each complimented each other nicely. The atmosphere is great as well with big screen tvs to watch sport. My second visited I customize my burger the way I wanted to. You can either go with fries or their home made chips."}
{"text":"Amazing nachos... Cocktails were quite unique  and of course the burgers with the dipping sauces to die for!! Outdoor seating and great service."}
{"text":"I didn't want to review this place until I had gotten in several visits, but now I am confident that I can say: this place is amazing. This location is kind of weirdly placed in a strip mall, but the layout is nice and it has cool decor. It is a hip spot, and I like the design.

Each time I have visited the service has been great; the waiters check on you frequently and are attentive, but are not clingy or overbearing like some other locations. They also know a lot about the menu, so they are a great help.

The burgers are outstanding. The premade burgers are good, custom burgers are good, all  of them. They routinely have non-menu specials that are a great choice. All of the ingredients are top notch, from the bread and toppings to extras. I haven't had one I don't like. 

The sides are good; the fries are especially good. Truffle and Gorgonzola fries will change your life. My only complaint is heat level; things marked as spicy are decidedly not so. The milkshakes are unbelievable; the Caramel Pretzel and the Coffee and Donuts are generously portioned with great, unique flavors. 

I only have one real complaint: the wait. If you go on the night of a sporting event it is a wait; if you go on Friday or Saturday night, expect a 2 hour wait. There are cool places to shop at nearby, but the wait can get onerous. But with good food, that is bound to happen."}
{"text":"This place is fun! It has good food, and our waiter was really friendly and attentive. I always order the pre-designed burgers, and they are all really good and interesting. I had a great experience and will return the next time I am in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great for a lunch meeting (if you arrive before 11:30).

I have been to the location over in Fox Chapel.    This location rocked as well.   I decided to create a burger.   The burger was a little overcooked (I requested pink).    The fried egg and bacon were tasty and made up for the slight ding.

I always recommend the milkshakes.   I have to avoid them at all costs unless elastic jeans come in to style.

If you go to any Burgatory please be prepared for a wait.  

Service - Great - Our order was taken right away and we did not have to wait long for our food.
Cost - More expensive than Five Guys (which is almost next door - a good backup burger place if you cannot wait)
Atmosphere - Very similar to their Waterworks vacation.    It can get noisy at times.

I will be back - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It is making my burger list because they put liquor in my milkshake :-)

I have been to this place many times but have been asked to wait 2 - 2.5 hours for a seat.   I usually pass.    I stopped in for happy hour during the week and was able to sit at the bar and get a burger.

This place serves a great burger - cooked perfectly with the all the right ingredients.    I also ordered the truffle fries on the side (not served with the meal).

I ordered a Banana Milkshake with booze (not sure what it was called - some reason I want to call it Chunky Monkey (Ben and Jerry's) but afraid that I am describing myself sitting at the bar eating a Cheeseburger, fries, truffle fries, and a liquored up Milkshake) - whew I feel the need to do a push-up.

The food was awesome and the milkshake was a novelty to try once.

Even though this will exceed your Weight Watcher points for the year - you MUST try this place.   (I still will not wait for a seat) but it is good to check out for availability.

Food - Burger was awesome - a high recommend
Prices - Burger was about $10, overall bill for my little buffet was about $25 - liquor in your milkshake is expensive :-)
Service - Awesome - the bartender was great and provided good recommendations and explanations

Enjoy!  I will be back (after I buy some new stretchy pants)"}
{"text":"We came, we saw, we ate.   Our group decided to eat at the bar in lieu of waiting 20-30 minutes for a table.

We were served by a couple (tag team) of excellent bartenders who provided great advice.

Food:

Appetizer

Our group made the decision to split the Impossible Burger and some onion rings.

The onion rings were awesome.   Nice thick coat of batter, large slices of onions.  What is not to like?

The Impossible Burger had a mixed review with our group.   The carnivores in our group that ordered (The Farmer Brown and a customer Dry Aged Wagyu) were not as keen on the burger.   I like the Impossible Burger - to me, it tasted like a burger with potato chips (mashed on top of the patty). That is probably because the impossible burger's texture is from potato I believe.   It did have a \"meat\" taste from Heme (protein).   I think it is a good alternative if I want a lower calorie meat flavored item.

Dinner / Main Meal

I decided to go off the beaten path and ordered The Crab Shack (a very large crab cake on a bun).  Our bartender recommended the Angel Dust Rub, Amish Gorgonzola, and Truffle Shallot Aioli.  The Crab Shack was soft and delicious with the right additions.  I liked it so much that I offered samples to my group and they thought it was a hit as well.

The restaurant is in the thick of it on the North Shore.   Great vibe.  Great Service.  Great Recommendations.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Soooo good! The almond amaretto shake was amazing. The Meat Your Maker burger was so delicious! Took one star off only because it took just a little while to get my burger. But so glad I went here during my layover!!!"}
{"text":"Elk Burger. Rare. Arugula, pickles, tomato. Naked ( no bun!). Truffle dressing on the side. Heaven!

I have been here many times, each time knowing exactly what I want and counting on it being done just how i like it. Four stars only for the last time I went- my dressing was forgotten, we waited a while for two burgers, and my rare burger was medium well and dry. 

Our servers have always been happy to help us make a selection and super friendly. My one bad experience would never stop me from coming back to one of my favorite custom burger places in the area.

Use the No Wait app to get a spot in line while you drive in ! it alerts you as soon as it's your turn"}
{"text":"Great addition to the Waterfront and at a location that has not faired well for other restaurants. Checked it out this past opening weekend and it was really nice looking. We had an hour and a half wait, but they have the NoWait app to make the line waiting better, which allowed us to go bike riding for a bit along the river while we waited.  We shared the nachos as an appetizer, which was pretty solid. The I had a custom burger with fries, which were delicious. Lastly, I had to get fluffer nutter butter shake....mmmmm! As for negatives, besides the wait (which was expected), the service could have been a bit more attentive, but seeing as this was opening weekend I'm sure the service will get better."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype is about.  It's a kitschy burger joint.  I love a medium rare burger, but most of theirs are still mooing!  

Roll was good, burgers were large, meat fresh, and good ingredients.  

Service was a little snooty.  We did love the atmosphere!  But the fact that almost everything was an add on and an additional charge was terrible.  2 burgers, one fry, one (nonalcoholic) drink....$35 with tip."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!!! The burger was most excellent and Leslie provided top notch service while making bomb ass drinks!!!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are awesome. The shakes are heavenly. I love how there is a custom-burger menu, where you can create your own burger. They even have gluten free buns and vegan cheese, as well as vegan milkshakes! I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I would have to say that this was the absolute best burger that I have ever eaten. The service here was stupendous. A Nutella and Nestle Cunch milk shake?  Who would have thought?  It has taken me way too long to find this place, but I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"My parents and I were able to get ourselves seated right away one Thursday night and that's rare because most of the restaurants in McCandless Crossing have waits. I have been to Burgatory before in Robinson and remember waiting a very long time for a table. 

My dad was in the mood for a beer and I do have to say he waited on that to arrive for quite sometime. My mom build her own burger and I ended up building my own wild crab burger. I have to say I did enjoy mine very much. I ordered it bunless, smoked gouda and with Sriracha Remoulade. I can't say that our server was very attentive though because she had another server bring our meals and I wasn't given silverware. So I had to wait until she came around again to ask. Since I went bunless I couldn't eat it with my hands, things would have gotten messy! The food was good, the service could have been better."}
{"text":"1st time here. Just wanted to give some recognition to our waitress, Christy. She was great."}
{"text":"Average, line kitchen burgers... Bland.. Cold fries..told the server the baked beans were garbage and their reply was, \"no one likes them.\" Then proceeded to charge me.  Good luck w return business"}
{"text":"We both ordered our burgers \"pink\", but to me this was on the verge of being rare. Very red. The table behind us was complaining about the same thing. Nevertheless, both burgers were still delicious. I just prefer my meat to not turn my bun red and soggy... At some points it honestly looked like raw meat. 

I also got a choco taco milkshake which was soooo good but huge! I wish ordering half sizes was an option.  

My boyfriend got the elk burger and loved it. I would definitely recommend trying it for something different."}
{"text":"Awesome shakes and great burgers. I just created the \"Melody\" cookie sundae shake. Order it!"}
{"text":"Great customizations and friendly staff! Shared parmesan and pepper fries, these were huge. 
The steakhouse burger was massive but was delicious. Buffalo burger was just okay. 
I would come back, lots of selection and nice environment. Good for both families and friend groups/couples."}
{"text":"I ate here tonight with the family and it was AMAZING! It was so packed for dinner, by the time we were leaving there was a huge crowd. I'm a PICKY vegan and I was very concerned about what I could eat at a burger place but our incredible waitress gave me suggestions and helped me out! I had the most amazing soy milkshake and custom vegan burger, WITH VEGAN CHEESE! At a regular burger place!!!

I'm going to come back here ASAP! This was the best burger I've ever had in my entire life."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Burgatory.  I'm the kind of burger fan who has \"bun issues.\"  Issues w the bun, and issues w my own 'buns.'  I really hate it when either set of buns are too large and Burgatory buns are too large, and they make my buns too large as well.

This can easily be solved by ordering your burger open faced, and then cutting the single bun in half.  So many burger places have huge buns.  \"Here's your loaf of bread with beef pattie...\"  Do they do this so you think their burgers are bigger?  I don't know.  One thing I do know is that Burgatory Burgers have NO size issues whatsoever.

They are so huge, you may want to fast for two days before eating at Burgatory.  Or you could be a normal person and take half the burger home but I never have that kind of self control.

The first time I went to Burgatory it was a Wednesday night and i was surprised there was a long wait.  I browsed Barned & Noble for awhile, the strip mall location gives you a lot of options while you are waiting for your table.

One of the things I like about Burgatory is they do have a fairly diverse menu, including vegetarian options that (I hear) are really good.  I ordered what can only be described as the 'Sodium Burger.\"  It had red wine sauce and carmelized onions on it and basically, it tasted like salty onions.  Don't know that I'd order it again.  The beef they use is so nice that I'd urge you to go with a plainer burger.

I'll come right out and say it:  the burgers are just 'meh.'  

The kitchen also tends to over cook the burgers so unless you want your burger \"Joan of Arc\" style, order it medium.

Everything here is super salty and I am convinced they do this to sell more beer and it works.  Their beer selection is pretty good.

We also had the truffled french fries and the first few fries were good but the fries were so soaked in truffle oil it became almost inedible after awhile.  Oh, it tasted good, but it was just too rich.  I really think I dislike truffle oil.  ...White people problems...  anyway,

I was *that person* who ordered the mixed veggies at Burgatory and they were awesome.  Roasted red peppers and sugar snap peas. 

Whatever you order, make sure you get a milk shake!

I would knife fight my own mother over a Burgatory milkshake, they are that good.  My favorite is the almond torte.

This place isn't cheap, but it's not expensive and they'll give you enough food to feed your family for a week!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Very cold atmosphere and too loud. 5 small onion rings cost $8 but overall, we were happy with the quality of the food."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this for my Pittsburgh visit, and it sounded like the perfect Pittsburghy thing to have: luxurious burgers, luxurious shakes, crafty beers, gentrified and post-industrial. We were a group of 5, and we had to wait 90 minutes on a Saturday night - fair enough. They texted us when the table was ready, and in the meantime we could enjoy the fun and sights of Waterworks (well, Barnes & Noble and Bed, Bath and Beyond). 

We shared 3 shakes (pretzel-caramel, PBJ, and s'mores) - all three magnificent towers of milkshaky perfection. My personal favorite was the pretzel-caramel, which was salty-sweet (also, caramel-salt is very hip right now with my local crowd, so I had that added bonus of feeling trendy... EVEN WHEN I EAT). I got the Farmer Brown burger. Despite the whole place feeling abundant, the portion wasn't overwhelming. Okay, after a fried tempura portobello mushroom (with delish peanut sauce), 3/5 of a shake and my salad, I couldn't finish Mr. Farmer Brown. But so be it! I'll just have to plan better next time. It was glorious.

Limited craft-ish beer selection - I wouldn't come here for that, but it was a good layover while we waited for our table. Overall: definitely returning here on my next trip to da burgh."}
{"text":"Yeah. Probably the best burger I've ever had.  And you pay for it, but completely worth it.  Chips that come with the burger are decent, but probably should have upgraded to the fries.  

20 minute wait at 4pm on a Saturday.  Server was nice.  Had small issue with one burger not being exactly what we ordered, but it's all good.   

Recommend for sure"}
{"text":"Great burger place on a busy block right by the baseball stadium. 
I was there with a group of five and it was busy but we were still seated right away. There wasn't a game and it was still pretty busy so that was a good sign.
Booths, tables and counter seating as well as outdoor seating which is nice. 
Variety of burger choices as well as build your own options. They also had shakes and floats and sides as well. 
You fill out a card and check off all of the things you want on your burger. What kind of bread, meat, cheese, toppings, sides etc.
I had the impossible burger it was very good.
Service was good and the food came out timely as well."}
{"text":"We go there often for dinner. It is a nice place if you like customized burger."}
{"text":"I love the truffle fries!  I would get it without the Gorgonzola because it makes it really salty - or you can ask for it on the side.  I love the burgers, but the only problem is that it makes the buns soggy.  That's good, because that's one juicy burger, but also one soggy bun.  I always get the chips, and get the burger sauce/dressing on the side so I use it a a dipping sauce!  The smore's milkshake is also pretty good, and to me, I think it's meant for sharing.  There's so much!  And I also love the cherry coke float (in the kid's menu, hehe)"}
{"text":"My husband had to run some errands with several people, and we were treating them to lunch for their help. Unfortunately not one of them liked their meal or the atmosphere.  

My husband said his crab burger was really bland and underwhelming. He said there was supposed to siriacha sauce, which he assumed would give it a little bit of a kick, but he didn't taste any heat at all. The other three people in our party said the same thing; the food was bland, boring, forgettable, and underwhelming. 

Most surprisingly to me was that our party said the place was way too loud, and they didn't enjoy the atmosphere. Considering one of our party goes to rather noisy places on a regular basis and one speaks very loudly, I was shocked to hear them say the place was so unpleasantly loud to them. 

Overall this was not a good experience, and my husband didn't even get take out for me from Burgatory. My husband was unimpressed with his visit and won't be going back; it certainly wasn't an experience worth the approximately $60 he spent.  No, we would not recommend this place to others.

EDIT TO ADD RESPONSE FROM BURGATORY :
Nichole, 

We greatly appreciate you taking the time to tell us about their experience. We're sorry to hear they were unimpressed during their visit. We believe that one of the reasons we're such a busy little joint is because we love serving great food. Obviously, we did a poor job showing them that. We share all feedback, good and bad, with the entire crew and we assure you these concerns will be discussed. Thank you again for sharing their thoughts. 

Sincerely, 
The Crew @ Burgatory"}
{"text":"Love the Burgers, hate the service. 

I've eaten here three times and I've been very impressed by the food, even for take out! The Truffled Gorgonzola Fries are amazing and the Bangkok Fries...The massive Portobello Mushrooms that they are...amazing! . I haven't had a bad entrée or appetizer there yet.

The cocktails and service are another story. I've never seen a more cranky bunch of servers/bartenders in my life. I've tried all of their cocktails and I don't believe any of the Bartenders know how to make them; way too strong on the Alcohol with very little of the other ingredients, or it's the other way around. They also taste completely different each time: the Grape Refresher was anything but; the first serving all I could taste was Basil and Bottom Shelf Vodka. The second time, it was just a sour glass of Ginger Ale and Lemon. The Deuce's Wild Mint Lemonade was like drinking a Gin Martini with a splash of Lemon.

The Bartenders are more interested in their phones and their coworkers than the customers while their attitude leaves a lot to be desired. They also know nothing about their beers and cocktails; asking what type of IPAs they have on tap shouldn't be met with a blank look and pointing at the taps and when asked for a cocktail recommendation, you hear \"Uh. I don't know...\" and they walk away. 

In the end, call in your order and if you sit at the bar, expect crappy service if you aren't a friend of the Bartender. Four stars for the food (fries have the potential to be soggy when you get them home) and no stars for the service."}
{"text":"Burgatory is probably the most hyped burger bar in Pittsburgh.  I would reccomend coming at non-peak hours or when the store opens... This place gets packed.

I ordered the hard Espresso shake ($8.50) at 11:00 in the morning because I wanted to try it.  The shake was quite good.  It wasn't an overpowering amount of alcohol, nor negligent.  If you do order a shake, they are large, and you will want to be prepared to take some burger home with you.  I tested out a fairly standard burger.  I ordered a Standard Deluxe Burger ($9.50), which came on a Brioche Bun with Smoked Gouda, Lettuce, Tomato, and House Sauce.  The burger wasn't overly memorable but tasted good.

Is it worth waiting hours in line to eat at Burgatory?  Absolutely not.  But if you want a quality burger and the wait isn't too bad, check it out."}
{"text":"I went there with my fiance over the weekend.  I got the veggie burger.  It was DISGUSTING!  It was inedible.  It was a soggy mush and literally tasted like dog food.  I got the cereal shake, which was really good.  However, I came for great food, not a milk shake.  He got a burger.  I don't remember which one.  It wasn't great, wasn't horrible.  In all reality it was not memorable.  I guess I would try it again, but only if someone else were to suggest it.  I will not be going out there again without some encouragement."}
{"text":"I have to go with 2 stars because the food is just terrible. I've yet to try any food I like. The chicken is a ground chicken patty, not grilled chicken, which is gross. The burger I had medium well was charred black and dried out- I attempted this order on two separate visits before giving up. The only edible food I had was the prime rib sandwich and even that was worse than TGI Fridays. The milkshakes deserve about 10 stars but I can't write a fair review on a burger place when the burgers are awful. I don't understand the hype about this place at all EXCEPT with regard to the milkshakes. I've tried a few but s'mores is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Made two stops here, Bison burger, then another trip for Elk burger, very good service, great food, prepared off of a laundry list of options.  Staff is very helpful, fresh food delivered in a reasonable amount of time.  Burgers $10-$17.... not for the budget conscious, for burger lovers.  Plenty of options to have it \"your way\"."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We are here while visiting Pittsburgh for a Pirates game. It is very close to the stadium. There is the now mainstream idea available to construct your own burger, which proved delicious. Try the pretzel bun if you get one. The chile is great as well, and so is the standard deluxe burger if you don't want to construct your burger. Good friendly service, which was also prompt. We were most excited about the incredible shakes! Do not leave without one. We tried salted caramel, nutter butter and Cookie Monster. All were delicious and distinctive. Why has no one thought of this before?"}
{"text":"Wow, we finally got to try out this gourmet burger craze!  What an experience!

We went to Burgatory for a friend's birthday.  First things first, they don't take reservations, and if you go on the weekend, it is CROWDED.  We had a big group, so they told us to get there around 5:30, which we did, so we were able to get a table together.

The good news is, if you get there early, you get to take advantage of happy hour!  There are discounts on booze and appetizers up until 6pm, so hold off on putting your burger order in until you've had a snack first.

We got the nachos, which were huge and slightly overwhelming.  If I had to do it again, I'd ask for the chili on the side, because it kind of made the chips lose their crunch along the way.  But the flavor of the chili and guac was really good, and it was just the sogginess of the chips that took away from the dish.

When it comes to ordering your burger, you can choose from a number of pre-determined options on the menu, or you can do a 'build your own' from these sheets at the table.  You choose from a checklist the type of burger (and they've got a wide variety, from beef to chicken to veggie or crab), the type of 'rub', type of bun, and then pick from a list of cheeses, condiments, and toppings (some of which are free, and some of which cost).  Finally, you check off how you'd like to have the burger cooked, hand it over to your waiter, and anticipate the arrival of your burgerly beast.

I got a beef burger (hormone-free, woo woo) with mozzarella cheese, garlic mayo, onion straws, chives, and grilled mushrooms.  It was gigantic and delicious and pretty much the most perfect burger of recent memory.  All burgers come with a side of homemade seasoned potato chips, which were delicious as well.

The burger will be huge, so get ready for it.  After dinner, if you've got any room left, feel free to enjoy one of their many creative milkshakes.  As we had a birthday at the table, they sent over a birthday cake milkshake, which we passed around for everyone to sample.  It really tasted like birthday cake!  They also have a selection of 'adult' milkshakes with alcohol in them, but after my happy hour margarita, I was trying to stave off a food coma and stay awake!

Overall, the only thing we didn't like about Burgatory was the other patrons.  Yes, we were a large group, but we'd called ahead and done the process as the staff recommended, and we weren't just sitting around taking up tables after we were done eating.  Despite this, two middle-aged guys with attitudes thought it was appropriate to ask us questions like, \"When the f*ck are you guys going to leave your table?\"  So, you poor Burgatory servers, I assume you must have to put up with a parade of douchebags on a regular basis.  It was REALLY crowded, but we weren't the only large party there, and although our server made us feel super welcome, I felt a little awkward with some of the other customers.

So, that said, get there early, and plan to eat fast, if you don't want people eyeing you up the whole night :)  However, these burgers were meant to be savored, and it's probably worth a staredown from a jealous hungry  dude in order to make your burger last as long as you can.

Prices are quite reasonable: for two drinks, an appetizer, and two burgers, we paid less than $40.  I also can't say enough good things about how attentive and accurate our server was, attending to a table of 8 guests, plus his other parties."}
{"text":"The meat and French fries  are delicious . The place is clean . The staff are kind and the idea of customize is brilliant.. love it"}
{"text":"Great experience. Had fun building my own burger. Lots of customers but we did not have to wait long for our food. Our server was helpful since it was our first time there. A great burger and a fun time. Check it out if you are near here."}
{"text":"Alcohol in my milk shake? YES PLEASE!! Quite delicious. Everything has been said. The burgers are juicy and large. There. That's something."}
{"text":"Excellent! If your in the area and want a delicious burger, come here. I've had the elk, bison, and the meat your maker burger, I'm impressed Everytime I eat here. I love the homemade chips more than the fries, honestly this place is a Jem."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about this place so I had to try it again. This wasn't the first time but decided to try other things in the menu since it was the only place around the area with decent reviews. We came on Saturday afternoon for lunch and the place was pretty full. We got seated really quick and our waiter was friendly. We ordered the crab salad, some rib dish and a swedish fish shake. The food took forever to come out and so did our glasses of water and the check.

The crab salad was okay but it didn't have much in it. The crab cake was actually pretty decent but the amount of veggies that they gave us was less than what the other dish came with and it was supposed to be a salad. The rib dish came with a lot of veggies and a little cup with the meat in it. It was cheesy and there wasn't much flavor which is why they give you gravy. The shake was pretty good and tasted like strawberry shortcake with pieces of swedish fish. I didn't really enjoy the food and wait but to their defense,  it is a burgers joint."}
{"text":"Upon seeing that the traffic from the Airport headed back toward the city was awful, we decided to stop for an early dinner at Burgatory.  We have been to the Fox Chapel location, but not here as it was always insanely packed when we would want to try it.  I am so glad that we were able to come here as it made a bad experience I had at the other location way better.  

Because the space is bigger, I think the likelihood of getting a seat in a timely fashion is higher.  The first thing I noticed here was the service was better than the last few times I have been to the other location... less of an attitude, and more friendly.  It was so bad at the other location the last time, I could not help but complain.  Our server here let us know it was happy hour and that apps were 1/2 off and specialty drinks were 5.00 (I thing that was what she said), and there was a discount on Craft beers too. We ordered some fries and an Almond Torte Milkshake that came out so fast. We were used to the milkshake taking forever so were very surprised by this (and my husband was very happy).  I created my own burger which was good, and the hubby seemed to be a fan of his \"Elk Gone Wild\" burger.

I cannot give it 5 Stars as I have only been here once, but I will be back and if my experience is the same I will up it to 5 because it is consistent :)"}
{"text":"1 star. Yes, you are probably thinking that I am an asshole. My girlfriend and I stopped here on a Sunday night at 7pm. We have heard all about Burgatory and how great the burgers are from friends. I ordered the Deluxe burger and she ordered the Meat your Maker burger, both medium cooked. When we got our burgers we initially thought wow, the quality of the bun looks like something you buy in a plastic bag at the grocery store for your backyard BBQ. But, putting our worldly palates aside, we tried the burger. The meat was cooked to a perfect medium, the cheese was not melted, and the bun was DRY and unappetizing -- NOT the brioche buttery joy that we were expecting on our $14 burgers. 

When our waitress asked how everything was going, my girlfriend politely asked if the buns that we had were considered their brioche bun. The waitress chuckled and said that we shouldn't come to Burgatory on Sunday evenings because they always run out of Brioche buns and then have to use Giant Eagle (grocery store) Buns. WTF?!?!?! We automatically told her how crappy that quality of the bun was and that we were completely unsatisfied. It is beyond me why we were not informed that the Brioche buns were out of stock. We both would have changed our order completely. So I asked for a discount, she replied by saying that I was being too forward & that she would ask her manager. To be honest, our whole meal should have been free. We were not trying to be cheap, just unsatisfied customers that were not informed about the bun swap. 

Moral of the story: Do NOT eat at a place that specializes in Burgers, but thinks that it is okay to just swap out a Brioche bun for a store bought bun. They have no idea what quality means. And for that reason, we will never be back -- Even though they gave us a free coupon for a milkshake on our next visit. Two thumbs down, Burgatory. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Burgatory. It was alright. I had the Trippin chicken burger with Brie cheese, mushrooms, truffle mayo and crispy leeks. Husband had the Meat Your Maker with dry aged Wagyu beef. Like I said it was alright. Maybe we just weren't as hungry for a sandwich as we thought. The place was busy so seems to be a fave of the locals. Not sure we would bother going again. Tab was $31 with one iced tea and a soda."}
{"text":"Talk about a mind blowing veggie burger!  I had a veggie burger with the veggie patty, which in itself is fantastic filled with mushrooms and spices and a great texture and I created my own burger with the truffle aoli, horseradish cheddar cheese, and everything else you could possible want on a burger!  You could choose from tons of different sauces, cheeses, buns/ breads, and toppings.  My burger was fresh and crunchy with the crisp iceberg lettuce and moist and creamy with the sauce.  So delicious and I would even dare to say the best veggie burger I've ever had!  The service was also great and I like the fast casual feel of the restaurant without being \"fast food\".  Was too cold for a milkshake but those looked amazing as well.  The one thing to note if you are a vegetarian is they also have the Impossible burger but they don't have it listed on the menu.  I have yet to try the impossible burger but apparently it takes very close to a true burger.  I will definitely be back to this joint next time I'm in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I hit up this place every time I'm in Pittsburgh (around 5 times a year). The burgers are awesome and always cooked perfectly.  Had the elk burger this time with bacon jam and a bunch of other goodies.  Finished up with a Carmel pretzel shake."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a burger and beer. I had the Phat Patti's Veggie. It was super tasty. I nearly had to unhinge my jaw to fit it in my mouth. I also really enjoyed all the sauces/spreads you can get. The truffle shallot was my favorite."}
{"text":"Helluva Burger:)
Although we ventured out to Burgatory on a weekday, the wait time was still 60-90 minutes (not unexpected per some usuals we struck up conversation with while we killed time at the bar).  We started with the Strawberry Basil Shag cocktail (dangerously smooth and not too sweet) and then moved onto Brandon's secret small batch sangria; they were both delicious and, surprisingly, both complemented the burgers well.  We both chose to build our own burger. This was unlike any other custom creation experience- starting with your choice of meat, bread (or naked, if you prefer to eliminate those pesky post-holiday carbs), RUB (try the angel dust- a mix of garlic, salt, and pepper), gourmet cheese (horseradish cheddar was subtle but delicious) and sauce (mmmm truffled shallot aioli), I was able to build the beefy delicious concoction of my dreams!I If you're a beef lover, the dry aged wagyu served pink is amazing:)  Although I love some of the other Burger Staples in the Burgh, I think Burgatory tops it for me :)"}
{"text":"Burgatory is one of my favorite places to eat.  The atmosphere inside is fun and modern.  The servers are always very friendly and accommodating.

Everything I have ever had has been amazing.  You have to get a milkshake if you come here.  My wife and I usually get them to go so we can still finish our meals.  My favorite is the caramel pretzel milkshake.  It is the best milkshake I've ever had.  Each drink has pieces of pretzel in it.  

The portion sizes are large so no appetizer is needed.  The Morty's Steakhouse burger and the Meat Your Maker burger are my two favorites.  They are up there with the best burgers in the city.  Flavors blend together perfectly.  I order my burgers medium rare and they are always cooked to perfection here.

Update: I felt I had to update my review after having the Impossible Burger.  This had been on my list of things I wanted to have for awhile and I am so happy I tried it.  Everything from the flavor to the texture was eerily similar to a regular beef burger.  The toppings the put on it were also a great compliment.  Next time I am here I want to try it with some different toppings/buns, but I will definitely have the impossible burger again."}
{"text":"My mouth waters every time I think of these burgers. I have been here twice and have done the custom(build your own) burgers on both occasions....was not disappointed either times! The beef patty is Sooo juicy and flavorful...who needs the bun and the other condiments! Aaah burgatory...I think it's time for another visit!"}
{"text":"I love burgers but sometimes I'm too lazy to make them at home so this is the perfect spot to go when I'm craving a good burger. I love customizing my own. I haven't been disappointed here yet!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: Pretty typical bar-restaurant set up like Buffalo Wild Wings but with a nice dose of humor and character in their decorations. The booths are large, tables well-spaced and the place quite clean. Despite the high ceilings and large capacity I've never found myself yelling to be heard. The waits can be 45 mins or so during peak hours so it helps to call ahead or sit at the bar if your party is small enough. Service is a little on the scarce side but no major grievances the 4-5 times I've been here.

Food: When they do it right, the burgers can be amazing here. More often than not, our burgers have been perfectly medium rare like we ask and have been very juicy and tasty. They do use high quality meats and they offer a wide selection including bison and elk. If you don't like their pre-made burgers you can make your own however their form doesn't explain to you what the rubs like \"diablo dust\" or \"angel dust\" contain. Another complaint is there are almost no sweat-inducing spicy options even picking diablo dust, sriracha remoulade, and jalapeños from their toppings. The definitely specialize more in the savory department. In terms of the shakes, they're beautiful, incredibly rich, and velvety-thick. They can be quite sweet like Starbuck Fraps and are very large so be careful because you can fill up on them before your food arrives. My favorites are the coffee + donut and burnt almond torte. The frites are OK, some are crispy and some are soggy but they're still a step up from the plain chips that are standard with the burger. The only thing I would avoid are the side of beans as they were nothing but smoke and sweet which was a weird combination without some savoriness to bridge them.

Overall I love coming here for a good burger. It's definitely more gourmet than the Red Robin nearby and their shakes are unbeaten in the city. Give this local chain a try if you already haven't, just try to avoid the dinner rush if you can."}
{"text":"Went with the basic - wanted to taste the \"meat\" a burger should be tasty enough to eat plain with disguised toppings taking away from the main feature which is the meat! What separates the amateur backyard burger from their product! The tastiest meat I ever ate and still is Tessaro's in East liberty - http://tessaros.com/. I have to admit that their shakes are worth every penny! It's the best shake I have ever had - their fries need help but the burger was good! Not excellent but good! Tasty but not enough to eat plain! The Bun was a great platform and the toppings were fresh, the meat was not greasy and bland - it had character and although it's not the best I could eat here everyday! The drinks like all chains are over priced but refreshing."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and if I had to come up with one word to describe them it would be underwhelmed.

My burger was nothing special. undercooked, and overpriced."}
{"text":"Delish!~milkshakes and juicy burgers are perfect! Wish the truffle fries and any substitutions you'd like for regular fries weren't so much though"}

{"text":"Awesome Burger!! Had the Onion Rings as a starter-best I have ever had!!! Ordered the Mikes Scratch Margarita-Soo good, highly recommend it!! Good Job Burgatory!!!!"}
{"text":"As a burger hater, I was less than enthusiastic to grab lunch here but majority rules.   And good thing it does because I have been missing out.   I tried the crab shack and paid the extra dollar fifty for fries and was pleasantly surprised!   Was it a crab cake equal in caliber to Andora?  Not by far but I really enjoyed my meal and I've gone back for a second visit since.  On the second trip, I opted to build my own crab cake sandwich and loved it just as much as their version.  Plenty of options on the menu for all food lovers."}
{"text":"They have amazing burgers and shakes. I have tried their signature Elk gone wild, buffaloed Bison, and meat your maker burgers. All three of them are phenomenal. The meat is soft, juicy and flavorful. Among the shakes, I've had the Caramel pretzel and the nutty one. They're huge portions. I personally could not have both a burger and a shake by myself."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today and loved it! Great environment, clean dining area and restroom.

Had the \"Farmer Brown\" burger, and would definitely recommend it.

Their homemade chips are fantastic.

For dessert I had the Salted Carmel Pretzel shake, and I can easily say it was the best shake I've had in my life.

I will definitely be returning!"}

Herb's Grape Refresher cocktail: 4/5
Deuce's Wild Mint Lemonade cocktail: 5/5

Atmosphere: 5/5
Service: 5/5 (sat at the bar)

I was on a quest to find the tastiest burger. I think have found it...in Pittsburgh.
This is after trying the highly rated burgers at Umami Burger (LA), Burger Bar (Vegas), Lunchbox Laboratory (Seattle) and Kuma's Corner (Chicago).

The wait at tables were estimated to take 1hr (weekday 8pm).
There is full service at the bar and there was no queue."}
{"text":"This place was a great stop. Even a special stop at one point but we do n ot even discuss anymore. Loved the options was good for awhile then it just seemed like they would give it to you any way. Say something and funny things happen after that. So long as you just take what they give you are good!"}
{"text":"Is convinced my Beau is trying to kill me as evidenced by all the food & drinks ordered at this happy hour!!!! This is the best happy hour drink~food combo I have EVER had!!

We got a smorgasbord board of half off appetizers: Sirachi kissed wings, Bangkok portobello steak fries & the 3-way slider burgers of chicken, bison and hormone free beef. All were fantastic, but the mushrooms were INSANE!!! EACH COST AROUND $4.OO TO $4.50!!! The portobello steak fries were lightly battered & deep fried to perfection, served with a sweet/salty dipping sauce. 

We ordered 2 Holy Moses beers, 1 strawberry lemonade basil vodka without the basil AND THEN.......A Patron tequila  XO Cafe espresso with ground espresso beans & double chocolate syrup......DELICIOUS!

Total Bill $34!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place based on Yelp reviews and it defiantly lived up to the hype. Great beer selection, milkshakes are out of this world and there are an unbelievable amount of options for the create your own burger. There isn't a bad thing I could say about this place. Next time we're in the burg we'll definitely be stopping back."}
{"text":"My second try didn't prove any better than the first. I really don't like this place. The atmosphere has an urban feel to it. The seating is ample and laid out well. We were greeted and seated quickly.
Our sever came over and greeted us right away but then took a long time to come back and take our order. This became a trend. After he delivered our order we didn't see him until we finished our burgers. 
This trip we did custom order burgers. The house sauce was very interesting. It was a subtle taste that was a highlight. The sauce is a combo of mayo, ketchup, molasses and cinnamon I think. The burgers were adequate but nothing to write home about. We both decided to substitute the deviled eggs potato salad for chips-a $1.50 up charge. I wouldn't have eaten it for free. It was made with undercooked fingerling potatoes and the taste of the potato salad was very bland. Neither of us ate it.  We might have tried something else but our server did not come back until we were all done and  ready for the check.  He was totally cool with taking it off the bill. 
I know this place is convenient to the movie theater and people dig the shakes.  But this is just not a place I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with my brother and brother in law and his son. Four of us were waited on by a staff member named Miki.
I was taken aback at first, because I thought I was in Hooters. Uniform was the same, but the color wasn't orange.
The brioche bun isn't brioche, guess brioche sounds good?The bun wasn't fresh anyway.
I got the Wangu beef and it tasted good, but nothing great.Also ordered was organic beef, elk and bision burgers. Some nasty greasy overlooked potato chips
\"Homemade.\"
$25.00 a head for 1 beer each and burgers
In Pittsburgh?
For that price I wish truth in menu laws( like in DC) were in force."}
{"text":"I decided to do the build your own burger such that I could rate it fairly in comparison to those I've gotten all over by getting my usual favorite the BBQ Bacon burger. I chose the angel dust rub with BBQ sauce options with the standard beef burger. Incredible!! The baked beans were fantastic as well, almost like a side of chili. I'll be back for certain."}
{"text":"Stopped in for shakes and app. I ordered a nutter butter shake which was delicous-- peanut butter, marshmallow creme with crushed nutter butters onside. Omg it was fabulous. My bf ordered the burnt almond torte milkshake which I'm assuming was actual cake blended with amaretto. Both shakes were great. 

For food we ordered the six napkin nachos. Very fitting name. It has chili, jalapenos, corn, melted cheese, lettuce, sour cream and guacamole. They were delish.

Brandy was our server and she was very enthusiastic and gave great suggestions."}
{"text":"This place probably doesn't need another review, but I have to at least add my five stars. It was the best damn burger I've ever had. The whole place is brilliant: A thorough, clever, hilarious concept carried through from the building exterior to the little red devil's pitchfork through the center of the burger. There is serious attention to detail in this place, and not just in the aesthetics, but also in the food. I could not believe that my medium-done (\"pink\") burger didn't bleed all the way through the bun, didn't fall apart, didn't drip cheese all over the place, didn't soak the onion straws on it... These people are paying attention not just to flavor and doneness and mouthfeel, but to how the WHOLE thing works together, how easy it is to eat, etc.

I made my own burger, my friend got the \"Meat Your Maker\" and raved about it from beginning to end. Also the best burger he's ever had.

The fries are tiny (in length) but huge on flavor. The chips, I'm pretty sure, are homemade, slightly thicker than Lay's, with good body, perfectly salted.

We got a pretzel milkshake and thought it was perfectly sweet (not too much, not too little) and beautifully thick--but not so thick you couldn't get it through a straw.

If it's any indication: We left there at 9 pm on a Sunday night. Burgatory was still so backed up people were waiting half an hour for a table. Four doors down, the 5 Guys was E-M-P-T-Y. And rightfully so. I can't see that place lasting another 6 months with Burgatory right next door.

We drove 5 hours from Blacksburg, Virginia to visit Pittsburgh this weekend, and on the way back, we had this conversation multiple times:

\"Dude, we should totally take one day over the summer and drive up to Pittsburgh, eat at Burgatory, then just drive back down.\"

\"Let's do it.\"

[1 hour later:]

\"They should build one of those Japanese bullet trains straight from Virginia Tech to the Burgatory in Pittsburgh. I would totally go there at least once a week.\"

\"Dude, we'll just drive up there.\"

[1 hour later:]

\"I'm hungry.\"

\"Let's go back and hit the Burgatory one more time. Come on!\"

\"Dude, I have GOT to finish my thesis. But over the summer, for sure.\"

\"What we need is a Japanese bullet train.\"

\"Totally.\"

You get the idea. 

You people who live there: I envy you.

You people bitching about the wait: Shut up already, you spoiled, whiny babies. Whip out your cell phones and entertain yourselves for all of 30 minutes. 

I WOULD DRIVE TEN HOURS JUST FOR A BURGATORY BURGER

AND

I

WOULD

BE

{"text":"Eh...
I have mixed feelings on this place. I'm not exactly a fan of a big ol' burger. I like thinner patties, think Steak and Shake style (but not exactly Steak and Shake, if that makes sense). The boyfriend really wanted to go here, so I caved. The appeal for me was not having to order beef. I'm not a beef hater, like I said, I just don't care for a huge, thick burger patty. Give me a steak and I'm good to go. 

I was set on ordering the crab, but when we pulled up outside the smell of the grill got me. I decided to go with Elk instead. I have had elk before, many times, but never ground. I've had it smoked, steaks, that sort, but not as a burger. I went with the build your own. I should have probably ordered the crab, but I have a feeling if I did, I would have been equally disappointed. 

Let me jump around for a minute...here's what was good about my experience:
1. The appetizer and sauces. I ordered the onion rings. They were deliciously crispy, and I enjoyed the horseradish dip and the spicy ketchup. 
2. The shake! I pay dearly (with nausea and a wicked stomach ache) if I eat too much ice cream/milk. I regret nothing. I ordered the carmel pretzel and it was really good. I couldn't finish it, but only because I know better. 
And...that's about it.
The burger...eh...it just didn't do it for me. I liked most of the components. The blue cheese was delicious, and is probably what helped me through the half I did choke down. The field greens were fresh and crisp. The brioche was pretty good, but had an odd aftertaste. I didn't care for the onion rub, and I love onion. It tasted very...I don't know...dollar store spice rack? I could say the same about the onion relish. I love onion relish. This one was weird, and very gooey. Bummer. The elk itself was the biggest disappointment. My $12 patty was way too thick, and small. There was about 3/4\" of bun all the way around the patty. I found this annoying. Rather than a big, dry, flavorless wad of meat, they could have pressed it out flatter, cooked it less time, and covered more of the bun. I think it would have tasted better. It wasn't juicy at all. And remember, I said I've had elk before. It wasn't that I just tried something new and didn't like it. It was really, really gamey, and very chewy. I just couldn't do it. Total disappointment. 

I totally agree with the other comment made about the waitresses being \"frosty.\" Ours explained nothing. Didn't ask if we had questions, didn't explain the rubs, nothing. Whatever. 

The boyfriend got one of the bison burgers, and he liked it, and enjoyed his alcoholic shake. If we do go back, I'll probably try the crab, or maybe just stick to appetizers. 

For what you get, I think this place is really overpriced, and the main attraction, the burgers, severely overrated. As for atmosphere, the chairs are hard, metal, and uncomfortable, and the tables are really tiny. A water, a milkshake, and the tin, for 3 people (a friend had joined us) plus appetizer plates and burgers, and all the standard crap in the center of the table already, and we were knocking things over all over each other. It was loud, crowded, and just not that awesome. Unless the boy demands it, I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Flippin best burger joint I have ever been too.  There natural beef has tremendous flavor that just can't be beat!  I always opt for Create your own.  Place is always packed which can suck sometimes but I don't blame people for always wanting to be here.  All burgers come with fresh chips but I recommend the fresh cut fries with your meal, as they have a fresh herb flavor to them.  Good line of draft beers as well!!"}
{"text":"Had the buffalo burger, fries and onion rings. Burger was good, fries were mediocre, and the onion rings were very good. It was not the best burger I ever had. The place is extremely noisy , seating is crowded, and the place is very impressed with itself. 
They had a great selection of esoteric sodas. For the four of us, the bill was $100...2 of us did have shakes and we did get two sides. But for what they charge, it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"I love Burgatory! Way better than Stack'd or BRGR in my opinion. I usually build my own with the vegan burger. The patty is handmade and delicious! I've tried to make it myself, but have not been successful. I always order the mixed greens as my side- the dressing on the salad is amazing. My boyfriend always gets a make your own beef burger and a side of baked beans. He loves both- the beans are a little spicy but some of  his favorite. We've also ordered the nachos. My main complaint is the lack of salsa on them- in my opinion nachos should always have salsa and beans. They guacamole appetizer is great too. The guacamole is fresh and a little spicy."}
{"text":"I had never eaten at a Burgatory before, so when I was attending a Penguins game, I had to try a burger at this location inside Consol Energy Center. The burger definitely tasted better than what you would get at McDonald's, but the price was pretty high. I guess that this burger place will be an occasional treat for me."}
{"text":"Six-napkin nachos - 2.5 stars - We typically enjoy toppings of jalapeno peppers, jack and cheddar cheese, and guacamole, but these nachos tasted mediocre.
Standard deluxe burger and custom creation burger - 2.5 stars each -  The lettuce, tomato, and onion tasted fine, but the white American cheese was watery. The ground beef was cooked to our preference.
Chips and fries - 2.5 stars each - I was not a fan of the chips, and I thought that the fries had too much seasoning.
Service - 3 stars - The water was polite and brought out our food and soda/water on time. 
Overall - 2.5 stars - We ate only half of our food and still felt hungry afterward."}
{"text":"When I saw that they had the Fiddy-Fiddy Burger, a burger that is half bacon and half beef, I knew I had to come here. While the service leaves a little to be desired (and I give them some leeway, since it was a busy Saturday night with a game next door at PNC Park), the food is well worth it.

I would suggest getting a customized burger. I got a Fiddy-Fiddy with cheddar cheese on a pretzel bun. It was, honestly, one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was salty, smoky, juicy and just everything you would imagine a burger made partly out of bacon is. If I could have one every day I would gladly drop dead of a heart attack in five years. They're really that good. If you're really feeling gluttonous get one of their shakes. Their Burnt Almond Torte shake, flavored with amaretto, is tasty and addictive. There are little pieces of almond floating in it, giving it a nice crunch. 

Anyway, I'm sad there isn't one of these near me, but when I make the journey out to Pittsburgh again I'm sure to stop back at another Burgatory location. The choices are endless and the food is good, burger lovers should rejoice."}
{"text":"Good food and service but I expect that for a higher cost. Have to say the burger I had this time was incredible. You do get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"I like burgers.  I like the unique 'botique'-burger treatment that Burgatory gives its burgers.  I will keep coming back...but...

I've had a mixed bag of experiences.  Half so-so, and half really good.  

In general I'd say my so-so experiences are characterized by an overdone, dry burger.  That's a pretty big deal for a place in Burgatory's price point, selling gourmet versions of the Five Guys burger next door.  I mean, what's to keep you coming to get a so-so burger at twice the price?

In addition to that, about 2/3 of the time the chips they serve with the burgers taste stale.  I'm not sure if they make them ahead or not.  They just taste like they did.  

Finally...the fortune cookie.  It's never NOT been stale.  

My really good experiences are when the burger is well cooked (not cooked well...if you get my meaning), and the chips are crisp and fresh.  I can overlook the stale fortune cookie...I mean it's not why I'm there.

The shakes are great (but too filling for me in general) and I have complaints about the staff.  If you visit, I hope it's on a 'really good' day."}
{"text":"I love burgers, and I like milkshakes.. and I want to like this place, but for some reason their burgers just don't cut it. They have lovely sides, a few uninspired burger creations and decent prices. The shakes really seem to be the star of this show."}
{"text":"Where to start let's see the chili as an appetizer is phenomenal. Then you get to the burgers no matter which one you choose you will be happy one of my favorites is the elk gone wild it's phenomenal. Then you get to the milkshakes there's really no words to describe it but delicious incredible"}
{"text":"Love the alcoholic milkshakes!! Enough said!... :)
The food was good too of course.
It can get pretty busy and compact but I was happy by the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Best burgers and shakes I've had in a while... And their chips were amazing too. I ordered farmer's brown and the fresh buns, over easy egg and beef burger made a great combo. The strawberry chocolate milkshake was pretty heavy but not overly sweet. There were actually chunks of strawberries in there which made the texture even better. It seems like some people here had issues with their service but based on my personal experience everything was fine."}
{"text":"I suppose I could have seen it as an omen, that when I searched for Burgatory on my Yelp app, it asked me, \" Did you mean \"purgatory\"?\". Despite that glowing recommendation we hit this eatery on our way out of Pittsburgh, after a day trip there.

My traveling companion had stumbled on the place, while perusing Yelp reviews from Steel City, and thought it looked promising. I was a little wary about trusting a restaurant tucked into a suburban strip mall but without a better suggestion, I acquiesced . 

It had a sparse but inviting decor. I loved the idea of the large Venn Diagram mural in the Lobby \" Do you like burgers? Yes? No?\". This was a weekday around 5pm, so it wasn't at all busy(yet) and we were sat immediately.

I wish I could say that we were visited immediately ( or even within 10 minutes) by a server but it took someone entirely too long to greet us. By the time a server did show, we had already decided on our whole meal.

The menu was short and sweet, which was a plus for me. You can choose from a selection of their specialty burgers or create your own. For my Philly friends, it's very similar to our PYT right down to the spiked shakes.

Their beer selection was tremendous! I chose a Rouge Chocolate Stout on draft , which was 1/2 price for Happy Hour( $3). I was more than pleased.

Our server was pleasant and efficient but nothing special. My biggest problem was that because we ordered all at once, the food came out all at once. We had our apps for all of 2minutes ( without side plates) before the burgers came out. As you can imagine, a loaded burger is messy,we needed extra napkins, and it took her awhile to come back and check on us. While not damning, the service we received keeps this from being a 5star review.

The food was exceptional. We shared onion rings and \" steak fries\" as apps. When the o-rings were dropped down, I thought there was a mistake. I didn't order a plate of cake donuts. Those rings were the biggest and most meaty onion rings I'd ever eaten and they were good. I can think of 2 words wrong with our \" steak fries\" ...\" steak\" and \" fries\". The steak fries are actually portabella mushroom strips, seasoned and lightly battered and I was amazed at how much they actually did taste like steak fries. Another winner.

Again I'll supply my Philly friends with another comparison. Their burgers are comparable with those you can get at The Institute. Same whispy fries, similar bun and burger ratio. Similar great taste. My friend and I both ordered the Morton Steak burger. I was too tired after an exhausting day touring Pittsburgh to choose my own ( the choices are endless, but I like option of the sheet at the table that you can mark off and hand to your server.). The Steak burger had most of what I like anyway, horseradish cheddar, onion straws, a tasty red wine sauce. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

We were stuffed but we had to try a highly recommended shake. I wasn't driving so I chose the Grandads Secret ( caramel+ bourbon...I always suspected this about pop pop) and my friend got the Smores one, complete with a toasted marshmallow on top. We agreed that they were fantastic and I totally appreciated the extra wide straw.

Overall I'd say that it was a great experience and that the good far outweighed the bad. Not sure if this is a chain restaurant ( it seems like one) and if so, they are welcome to penetrate the Philly area. So we were filled up, boxed up, and ready to make the long trip home.
I have to say though, that Burgatory didn't occur while we were in the establishment. Burgatory happened about an hour later, with 2 gassy guys locked in a small mini Cooper for 5hours, headed 70mph east. We will never be the same."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers. I have never been disappointed with a burger from Burgatory. The milkshakes are amazing!"}
{"text":"Burgatory makes a damn good veggie burger (it's vegan too!), with lots of great topping options. On Tuesdays, they also feature a vegetarian/vegan special, and a vegan shake!!! They also seem to play some better music on Tuesdays; music for vegetarians (The Smiths, The Cure...). Even though this is a loud, happening place, they don't blast the music (like Mad Mex does). Also notable, is their house made shrub cocktails, though for the most part their cocktails are kinda weird, like immature, as in a teenager would love them; sweet and easy drinkin'. Servers are usually efficient. Expect a wait for dinner, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"These people take burgers seriously. I'd visit Burgatory any time over Five Guys, Shake Shack, or any other burger chain nearby! The only place that can compete with Burgatory is Walat's.

I chose the toppings myself this time, which easily can get \"too much\" if you can't stop! I had the \"Fiddy-Fiddy\" with Angel Dust rub, Bourbon BBQ sauce, white american cheese, Iceberg salad, Mayo, Jalapenos and Sliced Tomato as toppings on a Brioche bun. 

I'm planning on picking a burger off the menu next time - Hope to get a better taste balance and combination of meat and toppings. I really can recommend the \"Fiddy Fiddy\" meat though, (50% ground beef, 50% ground bacon)."}
{"text":"I decided to create my own burger! I went with a brioche bun, beef, provolone cheese, egg avacodo, opinion shreds, lettuce, tomato and mustard!!! It was amaze balls!!! Yes I just said amaze balls! I don't eat burgers very often. Let's just say I would come back and cheat at this place in the middle of week. I loved it. 

The restaurant itself was very clean and the service was fantastic. My fiancé was guzzling water but she stayed on top of keeping drinks refilled and was super happy to answer any questions we had. I knew right away that I wanted my own burger my own way. I really like that it had the menu option to build your own burger! Nice! I love avacodo and egg on my burgers ( when I do eat them) I was very impressed with the way the burger tasted. The chips that came along with it were OKay. I wished They had all been cooked the same, some were a little more done than my taste. They were still really good tho! Love the place I will be back! Whe I return I will enjoy a milk shake too!!!"}
{"text":"burgers are good. although for some reason we (only 2 of us) thought we needed onion rings and portabello fries for an appetizer in addition to our burgers. so we left VERY FULL. next time i know not to order as much, because the food is so good, you want to eat everything, but your stomach cannot handle it all! 

cannot wait to go back for the burgers... yum!"}
{"text":"I can totally get on board with the concept here, especially since snobby BRGR doesn't allow customization of their burgers at all. Burgatory, by contrast, embraces customization to the extreme with cute build-your-own sheets that you can fill out with a pencil. Gotta love that.

They have almost everything you could ever want on a burger (except brie...hint hint). Be careful not to get overzealous with your toppings though, or it will be impossible to eat. Just definitely add their truffle-shallot aioli because it's easily the best thing on that list. And they definitely put BRGR's fries to shame, although if you decide not to upgrade and stick with their homemade chips, you won't be disappointed either.

What you may be disappointed in is their idiotic doneness scale that goes by color. I like my burgers rare, so of course I circle \"Red.\" That usually gives me about a medium, a little less than medium if I'm lucky. I get that they're trying to be quirky, but there's a reason the current doneness scale exists--it allows customers to order their meat at a specific temperature, yielding consistent results no matter where they eat. Well, in theory anyway...we all know this isn't true in practice, so why does Burgatory feel the need to complicate things further by making us learn a new scale that, based on my experiences, doesn't even go as raw as I'd like? The always overcooked burgers are what makes this place not my favorite, but since you can cover them with a ridiculous amount of toppings, it's not the worst thing ever. And of course if you like your burgers medium to well done, you'll be happy.

The boozy milkshakes are pretty great, and again, way better than BRGR's. I love the Bacon-Apple-Pancake, but it's literally a meal in and of itself. I wouldn't attempt this with a burger and fries again, unless I had the sudden urge to go into cardiac arrest. The best thing to do is to come with a friend and split one of the shakes, that way you'll still have room for the real food!

So I know a lot of people are in love with Burgatory, but I'm not about to marry it. I'm already in a committed relationship with Winghart's, but I have to admit I'll sneak away for a hookup with Burgatory every once in a while. Shhh...don't tell!"}
{"text":"Need to go back, but I love the make-your-own style of ordering. Portions were huge, food was delicious - definitely not your run-of-the-mill burger joint."}
{"text":"Love the veggie patty and the build your own menu."}
{"text":"I have heard about Burgatory since moving to Pittsburgh almost two years ago and finally got around to trying it.  I was glad that it lived up to all the hype I had heard.  

I love the signage and decor inside.  It was fun reading all the quotes and looking around.

You are missing out if you come here to eat and don't try one of the milkshakes.  In fact, I'd come for a repeat visit just for the shakes they were that good.  My husband had a daily special shake - pretzel jello.  It was a summer dessert with a fun (and boozy) twist.  I had the apple pancake and bacon shake.  It was divine.  The waitress warned me that it had bits of bacon and some people don't like that.  It made me even more intrigued and once I tried it, made it just that much more delictable.

After much internal debate, I tried the Meat Your Maker burger.  It had wagyu beef, onions, cheese and was intensely flavorful.  My husband chose to make a custom burger and really enjoyed his creation as well.  

We shared the \"just fork it\" appetizer - a poutine style dish with fries with short ribs, cheese curds and gravy.  It was wonderful.  It was so filling, I could have ordered just that.

Service was attentive and friendly.  

I can't wait until the Murraysville location opens so I have a location to visit that is closer to home."}
{"text":"I'm excited that one of the gourmet burger restaurants is finally out in the Eastern suburbs.

The decor is fun and matches the theme well.  There are a variety of seating options (including patio and at the bar).  

Food is tasty but prices add up quickly.  There are several pre put together burgers and you can also customize (with different toppings and meats).  

The down side is that it is so popular that it is almost always crowded.  The good news is that you can download the No Wait app and get on the list without physically waiting in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is great, and that's coming from a vegetarian. First, the atmosphere is awesome. It's really open and the booths surround a huge bar and tons of tv's. Phat Patti's veggie burger is awesome, and their herbed fries are super yummy as well. I brought my out of town friends here during their visit, and they all got the ground bacon/beef burger and raved about it. 

My favorite shake is the burnt almond torte...it has pieces of actual Prandl's burnt almond torte cake in it (with vanilla vodka!) and it's to die for. The salted nutella crunch shake is a close second. The shakes are HUGE, two people can really share one. 

The wait can be a little ridiculous on the busy nights, but that's to be expected. So many restaurants have failed in the spot that Burgatory now occupies, but it looks like Burgatory is here to stay."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from grubhub. We both built our own burgers (I ordered the vegan patty) and they gave us a courtesy call to let me know the bun I selected was not vegetarian and changed my order to accommodate my dietary needs. Brownie points! But, when the food came....my burger was on the non-veg bun and the other beef burger came on my veg bun. Also, the beef burger was missing two toppings, one of which we paid extra for. Snaffoos aside, the food was really delicious and it came within 20 minutes of ordering. So maybe it's best to eat."}
{"text":"I cannot begin to describe how this place jumped into my heart and nestled into a corner, never to be lost...but I'll try.

I went here with some friends and was pleasantly surprised by the iPad being used to check us in and the text message service that was available. I am not typically a fan but it was pretty cool to see this technology used. The place is just cool. The garage door open on a beautiful day. A cool bar and urban feel. I opted for the create your own burger and was thrilled by the plethora of options. I will make this brief..my burger came out and it was FANTASTIC! I have had few burgers that compare to the beauty that my taste buds experienced at this glorious moment in time. The chips were good but who cares if they tasted like mud after eating this burger. I could go on but I'd rather just let you head out and start eating...

Tip: their jalapeños are not tame...I got them on the side and am thankful I did. A few will do.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"Tues is their vegetarian day. They have a veggie burger special and they have a vegan milkshake special. This place is consistently very good. My favorite burger place in Pittsburgh. I just wish they had a location in the East End. Bakery Sq perhaps? Someday maybe."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the psychedelic shroom \"hand\". It's better than the meat burgers- seriously just try it- it's amazing!"}
{"text":"This location is a genius one, because there is a certain lack of good restaurants in the Waterfront area (many are chains or just mediocre...). Also, it's so much closer than the one at Waterworks or in Robinson. In any case, the wait is a bit long as usual, but the ambiance and overall setup is great. Not too loud, but still a pretty fun atmosphere. I like that they offer all sorts of exotic meats from elk to bison, and perhaps I will try those in the future. This time I went with a custom burger with the usual beef patty, and it was pretty cool to be able to choose everything from the topics to the sauce to the rub. 

The burger was done pretty beautifully, not too much stuff dripping out and not at all falling apart as it was eaten. At the same time, there was definitely a lot of flavor, and the amount of toppings (4 for me) was just right. Not only that, but their chips and fries definitely sealed the deal (especially because a side comes by default instead of being extra). Crispy and savory they were, with the latter having been seasoned generously with dill, which was pretty neat. Overall, definitely one of the better burgers all around."}
{"text":"I ended up getting a build-your-own burger tonight. Pretzel bun, half beef/half bacon, no sauce, and some veggies. Fries instead of chips.

The burger was okay; a little salty which I liked (due to the bacon) but it could have still been more well done (I asked for well-done and it was medium at best). It had a fryer grease overtone to the whole thing.

Fries were okay; to me, anything is better than home-fried potato chips. Too bad they were cold.

We also got the big cookie dessert. Our waitress, Megan, told us the cookie was 8\" in diameter, it was more like 4 or 5. It was really, really good, though. Easily two servings, but definitely not three. They don't have sweet tea or raspberry tea, either.

I didn't care for the atmosphere; very loud and very cold. It was 30 degrees outside and not much warmer indoors, even with every seat filled and space heaters cranking. The wait area is also stuffy, cramped, and uninviting.

Seats were EXTREMELY uncomfortable. They were basically lawn chairs.

Overall, I'd give Burgatory three stars for food, but between being stabbed on price, terrible waiting area, dirty floors, uncomfortable chairs, and the very cold dining room, I think two is justified. I probably would have awarded only one star had I not sprung for dessert.

{"text":"Some people say that everyone is creative, that even the small choices that a person makes are his or her art--the fruits on our breakfast plate, the washed-out blue denim with the herringbone blazer, the scenic drive over the straight shot. For people who appreciate this, the Burgatory menu is a thing of beauty. 

It's like sitting down with a skilled artist who has laid out all sorts of materials--oil paints, watercolors, pastels, charcoal, googly eyes--and you get to choose all of your favorites for them to create a masterpiece. Charcoal with deep red paint. Pastel pinks with glitter. Except, you know, this involves food, which is the actual best thing ever.

Caramelized onion marmalade, truffled shallot aioli, angel dust rub, cabernet sauce, bacon jam. Literally anyone can be made happy with meat choices including elk and bison, regular beef, chicken, crab (!?) and veggie burgers. Traditional white bun, whole wheat, or no bun at all--among other options. 

If you're not up for trying to pair BBQ with sriracha and horseradish cream and just want food in your mouth stat, there are some predesigned burgers that are their own works of art. Help yourself to a Monet. And it's always possible to get a regular burger on a white bun with lettuce and tomato. 

But then there are the shakes: s'mores, caramel pretzel, apple pancakes and bacon, Nutella crunch. Some are spiked. This arrangement is actually too ridiculously wonderful to exist, but there you go. Show up, eat beautiful things. Die happy.

{"text":"What a cool, fun place!

My buddy and I just happened to be doing a little sightseeing and walked by the place.  He instantly wanted to try it.  I was on the fence, it looked like your average chain spot, but he was all psyched.  Well it's a local chain, so thats better, at least in my opinion.  It's got funny stuff all over the walls, spiked milkshakes and the menu looked pretty good.

I happened to be looking at the menu and had no idea that there was a \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" burger list.  He pulls this thing out and starts going to town and I knew I needed to do the same.  I went with the Fiddy-Fiddy burger (1/2 beef, 1/2 bacon), on a local grain bun, with a cracked peppercorn rub, smoked gouda cheese, Sriracha remoulade, lettuce, mayo and jalapenos.  If that wasn't enough I got the organic greens as a side.

The burger was wonderful.  The meat was absolutely delicious and juicy.  The rub gave it a great flavor and all of the other toppings meshed well.  The greens were also good.  I was being good, after the debachery of the night before.

Honestly though, great place.  Very clean, attentive staff, delicious food.  I do hope this chain makes a move farther than Pittsburgh, because we could use one in NY."}
{"text":"Margarita was great! I got the standard burger, because it seems best to judge based on the standard... it's a good burger but needs salt in the meat, more special sauce & the bun to burger ratio is off. Also I'm pretty sure that isn't Heinz ketchup in their bottles which is blasphemous in SO many ways. This is Pittsburgh. Home of Heinz... ?"}
{"text":"Spice/heat are the key words here. Both me and my gf love spicy food however these burgers were to the extremes. We both had completely different ingredients on our burger but they were both almost to spicy to eat. Decent vibe for a quick burger stop. Average service."}
{"text":"I am stuffed. Filled to the brim with  beer and a delicious burger. 
Does life get better than this? 
Waddling out of this place I tried to think of a place like this anywhere else.
Expect about $10+ for the burger and another $1.50 for fries (burger comes with chips). Burgers have a good size patty and lots of options to building you own, although most premium toppings are $1-1.50, abundant choices of toppings.
Lots of beer choices. Laid back vibe. 
Lots of people having milk shakes, but after a burger with pretzel bun, I'm stuffed. 
Service was great! 
Fortune cookies served with the check...LOL! Hysterical! Seriously? Hahahaha! Laughed all the way to the hotel."}
{"text":"Good. I mean really good. I mean so good that you could convince a lifelong vegan to question everything they've ever stood for. The nachos are sublime (and could be a meal in and of themselves). The burgers are awesome. Quality ingredients prepared well. It's a simple recipe, but rarely executed with such precision."}
{"text":"LOVE. Never disappoints. We always go here if when we really want a good burger.staff is always good and the burgers are always done sooo good"}
{"text":"First time at Burgatory. Food is fresh and delicious. Had the phat Phattie and customized burgers. Milkshakes were large so split the strawberry with hubby. Kids loved the variety. The only downside was service was slow for the adults but quick for the kids."}
{"text":"This place had a nice atmosphere. Food was very delicious and the shake was truly awesome!!! I will return!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh after a long time away, I was taken to Burgatory for a treat. It was fairly busy for a weeknight but we sat right down at the bar and were served almost immediately. The bartender struck up a friendly, ongoing conversation as she worked, and the music wasn't overly loud. I had the Morty's Steakhouse Burger and the Apple Pancakes & Bacon milkshake. Both fantastic (although the shake was a LOT of sugar, almost too much of a good thing). Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a popular Pittsburgh burger chain. Whenever I travel I like to try local restaurants and this one didn't disappoint.

The ambiance of the restaurant is quite nice! Even during the day there is a romantic darkness to it. The waitress was nice and patient, explaining the entire menu to us as we were newbies.  I ordered the Rosemarys Smash and a steakhouse burger. My hubby got  a nice tall draft beer with the PBJ burger. For an appetizer we ordered the frites with the truffled gorgonzola cheese.

The drink was DELICIOUS!! Nice and and refreshing. So good I ordered two of them. the appetizer was out of sight! I could have just ate that and been satisified. My burger was simply amazing! It reminds me of the steakhouse burger Red Robin has. My hubbys burger he remarked was also delicious. The sweet potato fries that came with the meal were so/so. I could have done without.  

For the topoff we ordered the Grandad's Secret! Yummy alcohol infused shake that we shared and slurped down.

Great restaurant to try when visiting Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Friendly and fast! great service! Every time I have been to this location the staff is always great. I would recommend this place to anyone traveling to the north shore !"}
{"text":"My family has been telling me how good this place is for years.  Since we are out-of-towners, my husband and I just hadn't been able to make it here yet.  But after our most recent flight in from Pittsburgh we stopped for a late night dinner at the bar at Burgatory and were extremely impressed.  My husband said his burger was the best he'd had (sorry, don't remember which... the one with peanut butter).  I had the chicken burger with mushrooms, truffle rub and brie.  It was delicious, but pretty intense.  So much truffle taste that my mouth went numb after eating it.  We opted for potato salad and baked beans for sides, but I sort of regret not just getting fries (I was trying to be \"healthy\"). Washed everything down with a nice cold Yuengling (which we can't get where we live :) ).  I'd definitely go back.  Great location if you're headed from the airport into the city.  Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night around 7pm, and the wait was about an hour. When we were almost about to cancel, the host said 2 seats opened up at the bar and we grabbed them immediately. So basically we didn't have any wait at all since we got lucky! 
Coming to the cocktails, I got the strawberry basil shag, which had fresh berries and basil and overall tasted good. I made a custom burger with foccacia bread and chicken patty. Honestly I have never been a fan of any kind of burgers, but this was something really nice! The chips on the side tasted really great too! 
Overall, will totally come back here! I want to try one of their shakes, which are supposed to be really nice!"}
{"text":"Really good onion rings with jalapeño ketchup. Choco taco milk shake also really good."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times. I really enjoy their customizable burgers. They have a variety of meat choices and vegan options, toppings, a bread choices. The burgers come with homemade chips but I opt for the sweet potato fries. Although known for their burgers, they also have nachos, salads, soups, and more. 

Burgatory is also know for their shakes. You can get shakes even made with alcohol. The non-alcoholic shakes are only $6 and they have a bunch of different flavors with a rotating weekly shake flavor. 

On this visit, Burgatory was having an Apple Pie shake. I was leaving the area and once I found out, I turned back around just to go get it. I ordered my shake and asked for the leftover shake they usually give you when dining in. I've asked for this several times before. However, thus time I was told that the to-go cup is larger than the dine-in cup. I said, ok and didn't press the issue. However the bartender didn't seem that interested in providing service. I was sitting there ready to pay but she kept her back to me and cleaned cups until my shake came. She also never asked my mother if she wanted to order anything. This isn't my normal experience there but I was disappointed. 

I still enjoy Burgatory and would come back, but this definitely put a damper on my experience with the restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome addition to the North Shore! Stopped in before heading over to a concert at Stage AE, and managed to get a table outside with less than a 5-minute wait. They seemed busy both inside and outside, but to my surprise we were well attended to--our two burgers and two rounds of beers came quickly. I've had the phat patty and the crab cake one before but this time I went all out and got the burger with peanut butter, bacon, habanero jelly, pickles (piggy something...very apt name based on its size alone). It was delicious. They had East End on tap, so I like that I can support a local brew. Was a great pre-concert meal, and would be good (but probably even busier) before or after a baseball or football game. I find the area to be kinda weak in food offerings, so to me it was a welcome new option. Third visit to a Burgatory and still haven't tried a milkshake though. So I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Picked a time that I thought wouldn't be crowded: around 3:00 on a Friday afternoon.
Greeted/seated immediately. Server appeared quickly for my drink order. Friendly. No attitude that I have sometimes read about.

Ordered a Morty's Steakburger. Took a while to receive it. First impression was exciting. Little messy to eat... maybe that is why they brought extra napkins. Very good burger cooked just as requested: pink center. Sticky fingers were justified by the delicious bun full of goodies.

This is not something you shovel down in a couple of minutes. You eat it slowly and enjoy each bite. 

Chips didn't do anything for me, but I did not visit for the chips.

Overall a very good experience, but not something I would necessarily eat on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers!!! We all built our own. The beef is fresh and delicious. You must get the Angel Dust spice rub. So good. Roasted garlic mayo added just the right touch to my bacon cheeseburger. The service was great, took the time to explain all the different rubs and sauces. The fries were meh. Just ok. Hand cut and well seasoned but some were crispy and some were soggy. It wasn't a deal breaker though, the burgers were that good!"}
{"text":"I decided to try the impossible burger tonight because I've heard so many good things about it. It was definitely worth the try! The flavor and texture were both good and similar to that of a normal burger, I was surprised at how overall similar to a normal burger this plant based burger was. The seasoning on the burger was a little overwhelming in my opinion, I felt like I couldn't taste the flavors of the sauce and toppings as much as I would have hoped to, but I would get the impossible burger again no question!

The service was also good. We had a large group and the waiter was nice and good about coming back as more of the group showed up to make sure we all had drinks or anything else."}
{"text":"Took our daughter out for lunch on our way back home.  The service was excellent - Jessica was GREAT!

We had the Crab Shack, Phat Patti's Veggie and the Morty's Steakhouse burgers.  All of them were done to perfection and tasted fantastic.

Where they seemed to have real issues was with everything that was deep fried.  The onion rings would have had a great flavor but it was masked by the excessive grease left over from the deep frier - not worth the $ 7.50 we were charged given the poor quality!  The Chipotle-horseradish sour cream dipping sauce was very good but not good enough to warrant the $ 0.75 we were charged for an additional side portion.  The fires were limp and served colder then they should have been and their chips were over cooked and very greasy - possible issues with their deep frier temperature...  There was a $ 1.50 up charge to substitute the fries for their chips  - what a waste of $ 3.00 on the up charges!

The Caramel - Pretzel milkshake was very good but slightly more expensive than what I thought it should have been.

To recap, have one of their great burgers with a treat of a milkshake but skip the chips and fries."}
{"text":"When I'm visiting Pittsburgh, I usually eat at Burgatory when I'm craving for burgers and shakes. This place has options for all, vegans, vegetarians, and meat-eaters.  As a vegetation, I love getting there Impossible Burger! It's my favorite, and definitely recommend it to all my fellow vegans and vegetarians. They have a wide selection of shakes, and my favorite is the S'mores Milkshake! However, if you are not in the mood for burgers, they have other options on the menu as well. If you visiting Pittsburgh, this is a place worthy to check out!"}
{"text":"First off make sure you pay attention when your waitstaff tells you what the different dusts are. I didn't I ended up with a burger with devil dust. The burger was amazing but it was painfully hot for me. You eat it like \"oh it hurts so good\". All the food here is so good. There is a wait usually so plan ahead."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. I stopped by Burgatory when I was in town in May. It's now become a favorite of mine. 

The slogan Helluva A Burger, Heavenly Shakes couldn't be more accurate. 

The menu consists of mainly burgers with appetizers, salad, chili, ribs & chicken as well as the impossible burger (vegetarian). They also have a create your own burger option where you choose your protein, bun, seasoning, cheese, sauces, & toppings. The ambiance is great. The place is usually packed. 

If you're looking for a burger in the Pittsburgh area you can't go wrong at Burgatory."}
{"text":"I have mixed opinions about Burgatory. 

The decor is super cute and the waitress was friendly but the service was quite slow and the menu was all over the place. 

We came in on a rainy afternoon while running some errands. I honestly didn't want a burger but I assumed they'd have a salad or sandwich I'd be happy with and so we sat down and explored the menu. The waitress told us that any of the burgers on the menu we were not allowed to change. It's part of the rules. They have a checklist where you can create your own burger if you wanted to customize it. I didn't mind that until I realized you're paying much more if you just wanted a small adjustment. 

My husband went for a custom bison burger which he really enjoyed. My sister got the portobello sandwich and enjoyed it. I ordered the roasted turkey sandwich with the tomatoes on the side and when it arrived the tomatoes were on it. She took it back and brought it back almost immediately. I saw the tomato seeds all over but I didn't feel like fighting since she made a snide comment about how she told me not to change anything. Like how rude is that? The side salad that paired with the sandwiches were lovely and my husband quite enjoyed his chips. We all shared the herb and sea salt fries and loved them. The sandwiches were good but the bread was greasy and wet which made it nearly impossible to eat without a fork and knife. We also split a nutter butter shake which was good but almost ruined by awful cool whip that took over the flavor of the peanut butter. 

We were there for an hour and a half for 1 shake, 3 sandwiches, and a set of fries. That's just too long. Plus there were mistakes and the waitress was pretty off-putting. I don't know if I'd return if in the area."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! The burgers are awesome!! Staff are great and they are fast!  Just allow extra time on the weekends.. They are very busy!"}
{"text":"A $14 Burger served with chips better be amazing and sadly this was not. The toppings were good but the meat was not seasoned in the least. save your money and pass on blahgatory."}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! Wow! Coming from New Orleans I asked what is specific to Pittsburgh and all the locals pointed me in the direction of \"BURGATORY!\" My boyfriend and I stumbled in this usual burger place. {{SN: I can't lie we yelped it as well and we were like ok let's do it!}} Lol..ANYWHO...WE LOOOOOVE YOU BURGATORY!!!! WE LOVE THE  POMMES FRITES topped with TRUFFLED GORGONZOLA (OMG I COULDN'T STOP EATING THEM!!!!) WE LOVE THE Crab Shack burger, the Meat Your Maker, the Home made Chips...and the custom burger option!!! Heaven on Earth!"}
{"text":"I actually came here initially because they were doing a special cookie dough milkshake I heard about on the radio, where $1 of the proceeds from each milkshake sold went to a hockey program for underprivileged youth.  So, that tells you something about the restaurant's priorities!  The milkshake turned out to be absolutely decadent.  I've since gotten the caramel-and-pretzel milkshake too, and that was as amazing as the first one had been.  The fiance was very happy with his s'mores milkshake too. 

But, this isn't a review of Shake-a-tory.  

And the burgers absolutely live up to the hype.  Now, the fiance has had bad luck with \"build-your-own\" burgers here, but I have been gobsmacked by each and every burger I've ordered off of that menu, especially the big, juicy Morty's Steakhouse Burger.  Highly recommended!  Get the nachos...and the truffle fries...and the parmesan peppercorn fries...!!

It's true that there's a long wait, but it's worth it.  Go check out some books at the nearby Barnes & Noble, indulge your feminine side at the Bath & Body Works, or just sit at the bar.  The atmosphere and service are just right: there's not too much noise or distraction, but it's not so quiet you feel like everyone can hear your conversation; and the wait staff is attentive without being intrusive.  Seriously, I love it here.  It's a great casual dining option for the weekends."}
{"text":"YUM. Felt like a burger and this place delivered. Only drawback is the wait for a table, but if you're a beer drinker, have a beer and wait. It's worth it. You are able to customize your own burger which is the only way to go...I love burgers on baguettes, so I had a delicious Kobe beef burger with caramelized onions and blue cheese on a baguette. Served with a side of thinly sliced but not overly greasy fries. And a good IPA on tap to top it off. It was a lovely meal."}
{"text":"I visit this location each time I am in the area for work.  They have a good draft beer selection and the burgers are legit. I typically create my own to fit my dietary needs and I have not been disappointed.  I do wish they had a better selection of Bourbons which is why I gave them 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"While \"make your own burger\" might not be a unique idea, Burgatory's Custom Creation is a great take on the old idea.  

Start by selecting your burger, from Hormore Free Beef to Dry Aged Wagyu (with chicken, bison, crab, and veggie in between).  Then, pick a bun - I went Naked! Relax, that just means no bun.  From there, \"pick a rub\", \"get cheezy\", and \"sauce it up\" to your likening.  Of course, no burger is complete without toppings.  The \"No Buck Toppings\" are pretty generous and you can grab up to four for free.  They also have \"$1 Buck Toppings\", such as grilled pineapple and maple cured ham, if you want to go a bit more adventurous.  Finally, have it cooked either red, pink, or no pink.

No, Burgatory was not the best burger of my life.  However, it was very tasty and made exactly the way I wanted.  And while the wait was a bit longer than we anticipated, it was clear they care about their customers and service once seated was prompt.  I'd return if I make it make to the area and recommend if you are local you at least check it out once..."}
{"text":"For a Saturday night we were seated in an appropriate time frame and our waitress was immediately attentive. She was very friendly and pleasant throughout our meal. 

Drinks were a little over-priced at $9 for a cocktail AND a beer, however I ordered the Strawberry Basil Shag and it was very good. 

The party I was with all decided on customizing our own burgers- it took us awhile to decide and our waitress was very understanding and patient. I ended up getting the bison burger with the angel rub on the whole wheat bun. I added buffalo cheddar cheese, the truffled shallot aioli, arugula, pickles, and tomatoes. I also subbed out the chips for their french fries as instructed by one of the people in my party. 

The burger and fries were delicious, but the bun fell apart very easily so I ended up eating it with a fork. Everyone at our table finished their entire plate easily so I was a little disappointed that our portion size wasn't a little larger. 

The reason I am giving it a 4/5 opposed to a 5/5 was due to the price. $30 per person for a drink, burger, and fries was a little steep."}
{"text":"String burger, good menu but obviously not many choices for non-meat eaters. 

Service was good, and convenient to the stadiums. When I am next in Pittsburgh I'll be sure to return."}
{"text":"I like a good burger. I tend to be very picky about my burgers. Chilis, Smokey Bones - they have a fine burger. Nothing to write home about. But Burgatory has some darn good burgers. I had an elk burger there that was outstanding. Truly unique. Not everyone wants \"unique\" in their burger. I get that. But if you're looking for something slightly more interesting than a Sonic burger, and you want a stellar beer list to go with that, check out Burgatory."}
{"text":"Try the nachos. Great starter. So filling. Meal in itself. Ordered the Yin Yang chicken burger. It was a chicken patty (not just a dry grilled chicken breast like most places). Unexpected and delicious with the cucumber salad. Sunday lunch hour was busy but only 10-15 min wait. Not too bad. Oh - and great selection on draft (including Kentucky Bourbon)."}
{"text":"A great, cozy place to have some nice artisan burgers. I prefer thinner burgers to thick burgers, but I had to try Burgatory after hearing about it while on business. The staff was charming and I didn't wait long at all to find a seat, even during a busy lunch hour. The waygu beef burger was well seasoned and the toppings were intriguing, as they aren't the usual fare you'd find on a burger in other places.They have a good beer selection as well, and their onion rings are the size of small donuts. Definitely worth your time to check it out."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was good.  My only complaints are the noise level and the price.


I had a $11 build your own sandwich.  It was good, but I've had much better for the price.

Then the check is served with a fortune cookie.  I expected to find a custom burgatory type quote inside.  Nope, it's a normal old fortune cookie.

All draft beers are quality micros, but expect to pay $6-7 for a pint.

But above all'm my biggest gripe is the noise level.  We frequent a lot of \"sports bars\" but this is by far the loudest.  The technoish music is way too loud.  I had to lean into the waitress to hear her. Forget conversation over dinner."}
{"text":"Always enjoy a visit to this place for lunch or dinner! I enjoy the atmosphere, the friendly staff (at every location I've visited), and decently priced delicious burgers. I am OBSESSED with the \"Trippin Chicken\" - it's always my go to burger. The ability to \"build your own\" burger with so many options of bread, meat, cheese, seasoning, and toppings is always what my boyfriend chooses. Can't say enough about how much I enjoy a trip here for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"i absolutely love burgatory. food seems fresh and delicious. non pretentious. staff is amazing, and some have told me they actually all like each other. Usually i create my own, and i do try to mix it up, but sometimes you just get it right, so why change. . . I do prefer the rosemary fries to the chips, i'm not a big chip person. some of the locations used to offer a side salad instead for a bit more $, and that was so delicious too. the onion rings are almost as big as the burgers, found this out with coworkers who went for happy hour with half priced apps!  milkshakes definitely bring all the boys to the yard, but I'm usually too darn full. . . Oh and you can use the NO WAIT app for here. you're welcome!"}
{"text":"Their food is amazing, but go for the Shakes!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and milkshakes.  Our server was also the bartender and he was very attentive, provided good suggestions and basically overall great server. Otherwise the food was just ok!  Although my daughters kids hotdog looked great!"}
{"text":"Burgatory is always a good time with good food. Def our favorite burger place in the burg."}
{"text":"Everyone in my group loved the burgers there!! They were a little bit pricey...but you can tell they are good because the place was packed. 

At those prices, they should serve fries with the burgers and not just chips.

Service was a little slow...but overall, it was good. I'd go back again.

Visited October 2014"}
{"text":"Totally delicious you must look at the custom menu there so many choices of exotic meats cheeses sauces. 

Bison, Elk, Kobe Wagyu beef and more. 

You must finish your meal off with an AWESOME delicious milkshake; they have so many flavors to choose from  

I had the caramel pretzel.  Mmmm."}
{"text":"People have hyped this place up in this city for years. I ate here for the first time and the food wasn't good. The onion rings were greasy and undercooked, the burgers were flavorless. They hype everything up with the wordy menu but when you get the burger it literally has no flavor. I shared one with a group of friends and we literally couldn't tell them apart. The chips they serve with the burgers are terrible and seemed old and the milkshakes weren't anything to rave about. If I never went to this place again I would be fine with it. Honestly overpriced, burgers were just \"ok\". Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Darren almost eats himself sick here! I loved the pork belly sliders as well as the Jerk Chicken burger. The salted caramel milkshake is terrific. They make the best milkshakes ever too! I'm glad there's another one since it reduces waits. The decor is a blast as are the servers."}
{"text":"Visited the Consol Energy Center location during the recent NCAA men's Frozen Four.

Burgatory was only serving their standard burger during the Frozen Four, as well as a couple shake options. Burger itself was fine, albeit lukewarm, since they were already made and hanging out under a heat lamp. Burger, fries and (excellent Campfire S'mores) shake was a ludicrous $27.50.

Overall, I could see how this chain might contend for best burger in The 'Burgh--if your sangwich was freshly made and the price more manageable. However, I don't think you'll find that at the Consol location."}
{"text":"A solid burger joint with premade options and also a choice to build-your-own. The burger was \"pink\" as I had requested. I also requested it to be \"Naked\" (without the bun), and envisioned something totally different- I was thinking the burger would be wrapped around in lettuce (so you can grab it), so I didn't ask for extra greens. The naked burger was literally a burger without the bread. I also requested a fried egg- I should've been more specific and asked for a runny yolk (this, again, I just assumed). The fries were great (extra $ if ordering with the burger), but the chips that came with the burger was good, too.

You can use the NoWait app on your drive over to Burgatory; just remember to check in once you're there."}
{"text":"Went here about a month ago on a Saturday night. Yes, the wait was long. Yes, our service reflected the fact that it was busy. But, the food was amazing. I've always been a little skeptical of Burgatory, their burgers always seemed a little overpriced. But this dinner was worth every penny. We substituted fries for our chips and split a shake. The burgers were cooked perfectly to our tastes. I would definitely return to this location, even in a Saturday night when the wait is over an hour, it was seriously that good."}
{"text":"The more I go to Burgatory and BRGR, the more Burgatory is coming out ahead.  We were just there last night - if you are there soon, you MUST try their new cinnabon shake.  I forgot how seriously amazing their shakes are.  

I got the B.O.D. (burger of the day) - beef burger with cheddar, bacon, Bourbon bbq sauce, sauteed onions on a wheat bun.  It was very very very good.  Of course, the chips are always good - a few more sweet potato ones would be nice, but that's my only minor suggestion.  Luckily my husband hates sweet potatoes, so I got all his too :-)"}
{"text":"The waitlist for this place was over an hour! The food looked great and the atmosphere was inviting, so we decided to wait it out. The estimated time was pretty much spot on - we got seated about 10 minutes before our 60 minute estimate, in fact. 

The margharitas were delicious and we were off to a great start. The veggie burger however was simply mediocre. While they boast an extravagant medley of veggies, there's an overpowering flavor of horseradish which was quite distracting. The homemade chips were a nice touch however - crunchy and to the point. 

Another thing that I can't not mention is the service. The server was particularly difficult and was really against any sort of customization or changes to the burgers on the menu. Any toppings could be removed (obviously), but she refused to swap them with any one of the host of ingredients they boast. Any toppings we did want to change she simply stated would be \"brought on the side\" which just didn't make any sense to us at all. It's really not that difficult to put onions on top of my burger rather than 2 rings being brought on a separate small plate. We thought this was quite ridiculous. 

Overall while the drinks were good, the service and mediocre food left us wanting more. Wouldn't go back unless required in all honesty."}
{"text":"Woah.  This place is good.  Just burgers and beer but a good spot.....I had the steak burger and an ipa beer called Great Lakes and very good...next to all the sports stadiums too...."}
{"text":"Burger was delicious (just a little pinker \"medium\" than I prefer) and the spiked shake was phenomenal!!... But there was over an hour wait, and then almost another hour for our food to arrive. Good... But not sure sure worth my patients. *shrugging"}
{"text":"I love the custom-creation aspect of coming to Burgatory. They have so many different choices in rubs, sauces, types of bread. I always get the Herbed Foccocia bread. They have a selection of free toppings which you can put as many as you want, and they also have some paid toppings for 1-1.5 each. Each burger comes with crispy  Sweet & Russet Potato Chips. They stick a little fork through the burger with your  name on it. 

I haven't tried their already made burgers, but apparently you get more for what you pay than the custom ones, but I always like choosing what goes in  my burger.

Most people also come for the shakes and they are HUGE. They not only give you a tall glass, but they give you a large silver cup with the extra milkshake that couldn't fit in the tall glass. 

Definitely worth coming here. You'll leave fat and content. The only negative thing is the wait can be long since they don't do reservations, but they are accommodating enough."}
{"text":"I got a burger and skipped the shake.  I just couldn't see the value in buying a shake from a place that heavily advertised that I could get my shake with alcohol.  I drink, mind you, but when I think milkshake, I DON'T think drinking.  That's not to say they aren't good, but it is to say that they talked me out of it.

Which leads me to the theme of this place.  It's obnoxious.  Their \"sinfully good\" slogan is obnoxious.  Their ugly decorations are obnoxious.  The upscale feel for a BURGER JOINT is obnoxious, and the price you're paying for a BURGER is really obnoxious.

That said, the burger was pretty good.  It was also pretty small, and the burger plus chips (for almost $12) left me wanting to eat more.  Also, not the best burger I've ever had.  By no means bad, just not incredible.  But let me be clear... under no circumstances was it worth what I paid for it.  They give you a lot of expensive packaging and spend a lot on their obnoxious advertising, and that is what you are paying for.  I'd like to think I can be smarter with my dollar.

Their sides add nothing to the experience either.  I had homemade chips which were pretty good, but they didn't do anything to quell my hunger.  

The service was lacking.  I sat at the bar for over 5 minutes before someone even noticed me.  After a while, I was told I had to go elsewhere to order take out (which made no sense to me).  The lady who took my order was helpful and pleasant.  Yet overall, I walked away feeling I had a less than desirable experience.

Bottomline:  You can do better.  If you're in the mood for a burger, go right around the corner (LITERALLY... same strip mall and everything) and go to Five Guys.  It tastes better, it's cheaper, it's a better value, and they aren't anywhere near as... you guessed it... obnoxious."}
{"text":"I actually only come here for the burgers and shakes so I really can't say about the rest of their menu. 

I ordered:
- Meat your Maker: I got this with pink in the center and with fries instead of chips. Perfect.
- Vegan chocolate milkshake: I'm lactose intolerant and wanted to try this out. It was alright but I probably wouldn't order this again. I think I'm going to have to just bring a lactaid pill and order their other milkshakes. I've had their Nutella crunch milkshake and that was phenomenal and worth those extra calories!

I still think this is one of the best burger joints that I've been to so far in Pittsburgh.

Con: I wish they offered some permanent specialty shakes for their vegan/lactose-intolerant customers. Or offer to make other shakes vegan."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh has a right to brag about this place. It is THE best burger I have had, perhaps I haven't had a good burger yet, but these burgers are the epitome of burgers.

I may have to break it down by the building blocks of burgers. First off you have choices with the Custom Creations that include a wide variety of styles (see the pictures for a menu.) The bread is soft and fresh, warm, toasty but not crunchy or chewy. The meat is juicy, well cooked and flavorful. The toppings and additions to the burger add a flavor and style that is unmatched. The milkshakes will bring the boys to the yard. The milkshakes are thick, oozing with flavor, and a perfect portion. Burgatory isn't just a burger joint, they serve foods that aren't typical to a burger joint; it breaks the burger barrier. 

The service is rather minimal since a lot of the work is done by the patron. It isn't quick but its worth the wait. 

The interior is nice, dark, and my best guess would be urban. They ask for your phone number so they can text you when your table is ready, it beats carrying those vibrating discs. I have heard the wait is long, but depending on when you go, I guess the wait is different. My wait was only about 10 minutes for 2 people. They have nice art on the wall and an algorithm on the wall to help make your choices. The only downside I see here would be the density of seating. I felt the seating was too crowded. I was about 1.5 feet from my neighbor. 

I don't think I've ever had a smile while eating, but this burger just made me so happy. It is definitely a unique place in Pittsburgh and a taste of larger cities that it needs. I will come back as soon as I can."}
{"text":"Great burger. Would get the rosemary fries next time instead of chips but they were good too. Great shakes. Phat Patty veggie burger was delish as was the vegan shake."}
{"text":"This place is unique. A great collection of burgers, shakes, beers. The burger portions are large and filling. Burgers are said to be all natural and hormone free, and they come with some OK sweet and not-so-sweet chips. You can make your own burger, too. If burgers+shakes+beer is you sort of thing, this is a very good experience. Not a purgatory, but heaven for burger lovers... They have salads, small plates, and big plates, too.

We got two burgers: the veggie and the crab shack. Both were of good size. And, tasty. We were more than full after finishing everything and the fries. The crab shack was like a crab cake (a good one) inside a bun. I got the whole wheat bun, which was good. My gf's veggie burger was one of the juiciest veggie burgers I have had so far on earth. Goes well with the Paulaner in a bottle. 

We had three minor-ish complaints. First, some of the chips were soggy. Second, our waitress was somewhat slow in reacting to our needs or recognizing that we might have some needs. This was not terrible, but delayed our second beer order for longer than it needed to be delayed. She was overall nice, though, when she attended to us; the place was packed on a Saturday afternoon. And, they forgot to call us after a table became available. No dealbreakers, but Burgatory can become closer to a Burger Heaven if they fix some of the service issues and make their chips more fresh.   

The ambiance is more of a dim bar+restaurant mix, with dominant colors being black and red. There are many TV's, showing sports, around the bar. This place can get packed, so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I went to the Waterfront location while in town for work.  The burgers were only okay and the chips left a lot to be desired.  The beer selection had a nice variety of local draft brews but prices were steep for a burger with chips and 2 beers, $30+ with tip.  For a burger joint I expect more unique combinations and selection on the build your own menu.  The chips just don't match the prices or the burgers.  I sat at the bar but had slow service with the bartenders just being too busy making drinks for the table.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"Burgatory is a great place to \"get your carnivore on\". The \"You Build It\" concept perfectly fits these gourmet burgers. I created my own burger using Grass-Fed Elk on a Brioche; it was delicious... especially, when I paired it with \"Grand-Dad's Secret\", one of their spiked shakes! Took a friend from out-of-town here and he enjoyed it too."}
{"text":"I'm quite disappointed I had to give this one star. Please let me explain. I brought my family into this location  for a graduation celebration. The place was not busy at all.  The food was undercooked and the milkshakes were not impressive. I asked to see a manager and I was greeted by a cocky, blatantly rude young man named Anthony Pizutto. He seemed to be in training of some sort. I apologize if this is misspelled as I leaned his name from the waitstaff. Not only did he chuckle at my complaint, he refused to take care of it. I considered not paying the bill but what example would I be setting for my grown children. I explained to the waitress that his ill-treatment of my party was inexcusable and intolerable. I will not be returning to Burgatory, more specifically this location. I am sure to tell everyone I know that Burgatory is not customer centered and employing incompetent management. If this is the example of management utilized by this corporation, I don't see the company making it in the years to come. To top it off, the food was horrible."}
{"text":"I love burgatory. The wait here is ridiculous though because I'm not the only one who likes it. Got the \"no wait app\" and that's made is so much better. We just check in before we leave the house. 

They usually have a good selection of beers on tap or you can start with a milkshake. Love the caramel pretzel but it's so rich you need at least 3 people to drink it. 

The sriracha wings are ridiculously good and we always get an order I start. Don't love the blue cheese but honestly you don't even really need it. 

They recently added the potluck dinner and I am obsessed with it. It's over the top and so good. Before I found the potluck I would build my own and loved the variety of toppings. Morty's steakhouse is another good one. I usually upgrade my chips to a salad or fries. Love the salad their house dressing is good and it has sunflower seeds, parm, and roasted tomatoes. 

Service is usually pretty good. Just plan ahead and use the no wait app or you'll have to wait 1.5+ hours on a weekend night."}
{"text":"First time here. Haley was our server she was very attentive. We had 2 custom bison burgers. Very delicious, came out as we ordered. Wish we were in town longer or I'd definitely eat here again. Nice atmosphere, would make a good happy hour spot."}
{"text":"The raves about burgatory are spot on! It gets crowded fast but they have an electronic system for wait so you can look up wait time on your phone for up to date time statuses. After you get a text that your table is ready, they hold it for 10 minutes. While it is a small selection of specialty burgers, there is a comprehensive build your own burger you fill out. And there is no mixing up orders as your meal arrives with a trident and your name tag securely in it. The milkshakes are creative and delicious but very thick and sweet. A little too sweet for me. Interesting cocktails and overall good alcohol selection. Great place to catch up with some friends!"}
{"text":"I love the original Burgatory location, and dream about their milkshakes, even if I still think Tessaro's has the hands down best burger in the 'Burgh. Burgatory's are definitely almost as good, and they've got tons of topping options... plus those milkshakes.

My husband has never been to Burgatory before, and requested that we visit the new location for his birthday weekend; turning 30 calls for ice cream and burgers, right? We figured we'd go around 2pm on Sunday, hoping not to wait too long -- a friend tried on Friday night and gave up with a 2 hour wait time. It's good, but not THAT good, yanno? 

We arrived and the hostess entered our information into a tablet computer that may have been an iPad; I was hungry enough I didn't notice. She asked us if a 30-45 minute wait was OK and we said it was; she let us know we'd get a text when our table was ready. 40ish minutes and no text later, we went and asked, and she told us she'd been about to remove us from the waiting list since they'd sent a text and we hadn't replied. Ahem. We were sitting ten feet away from her, so that was a little offputting. Maybe don't rely on the vagaries of the cellular providers so much?

The seating in this location was a little cramped, as well; I felt like I was sharing a table with the party next to us, which wasn't an issue at the original location. I'm picky about seating; what can I say?

Luckily, our server was wonderful and made up for the rocky start. He was super efficient in getting our drinks and taking our order without making us feel rushed.

We each started with a milkshake; I went for the PB&J I know and love, while the husband tried the Salted Nutella Crunch. After one sip of his, I wished I'd changed my order. It was delicious and perfectly Nutella-flavored, although could've done with a little more salt. The PB&J was amazing as usual, though; I love the blobs of jelly, personally. 

Both of us also opted to create our own burgers. Mine had a bison patty, brioche bun, angel dust rub, blue cheese, onion marmalade, truffled shallot aioli, and mixed greens, with dill pickles on the side. I unfortunately have to order burgers well-done these days, but that's the embryo's fault, not Burgatory's. It tasted great anyway, and the mixed greens were excellent. Basically it was the same as one of the menu burgers but with bison and onion marmalade rather than Wagyu and roasted tomatoes. Husband felt it had a \"sour\" taste and didn't like it, but, when pressed, was unable to identify any further reasons. The dill pickle chips, sadly, were vinegary and unremarkable, and went uneaten.

He went for a beef burger, again on brioche (those buns are to die for), with BBQ rub, cheddar, ranch, and bacon. I stole a few bites and would happily have eaten his burger as well as mine, if it weren't for the fact that they're huge.

There aren't descriptions of the rubs on the menu, but the servers are happy to tell you about them. I love the angel dust, personally. And I understand the herbed focaccia may be delicious, but I can't pass up the chewy-soft brioche. 

We both got herb and sea salt fries rather than the chips, and they were good, though not the best fries I've ever had. I'm almost positive there's rosemary involved.

Portions are huge, and I ended up with half my burger to go, which is kind of suboptimal, for me -- reheated burgers are hardly ever worth eating. We also took half our milkshakes to go, since you get the entire metal mixing container. I wouldn't mind slightly smaller portions, but that may just be me.

Total check for two shakes and two burgers was $41 -- pricier than some other options, which means Burgatory is a semi-special occasion kind of place for us."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food is here. Of the food I've tried, I think the roam on the range burger is by far the best! 

A great place to grab dinner before a game or show in the North Shore. Make sure to put your name in on the NoWait app!"}
{"text":"CROWDED! Plan for a long wait if you're coming during a traditional dinner time (especially on weekends). I presume this will ease up over time as the place is still new to the area.

There is no call ahead option nor will they take reservations, but they will take your cell # when you arrive and text you when your table is ready. There are a few shops in the same strip (like Game Stop), so maybe you can go next door and play some sample games to kill some time. 

The build your own burger is becoming more popular, and I think Burgatory does it just about as well as any I've seen. There are options for thousands of different burger combinations. Our waitress offered a few suggestions to help me finish off my creation. I love that they give you a notepad with the checklist to make your picks. I've been places where you just had to rattle off your selections to the server and that is difficult when you're getting crafty.

I had my burger on a baguette, which was not as crispy as a traditional baguette, but it'd be pretty hard to eat a burger off something like that. I was pleased with the bread choice though because it didn't get soggy under the weight of all the extras and sauces I had selected.

The milkshakes are really good, and I think they do a good job with their fries, too. The milkshakes are big, too. You get almost two full glasses since they give you the steel mix cup, too. One of these burgers and a milkshake will fill you up, so consider sharing or pacing yourself! Oh, and any of the \"adult\" milkshakes can be made without booze or you can add booze to a regular shake."}
{"text":"Burgers were good as well as the milkshakes. Never in my life have I had a restoom that bad though. The bathrooms are revolting. Beware."}
{"text":"Was good in the beginning I feel like it has gone down hill since popularity and word of mouth !"}
{"text":"YUM.
We went here for the Hub's birthday and we were not sad! Here is what we had:

Gorgonzola Truffle Fries-if you only order one thing while you are here get these. They are so ridiculously good.

BYOB-(Build your own burger?)-I had the veggie burger which was surprisingly super good! The only complaint I really had with it was it kind of fell apart-but flavor-wise I would get it again. I would definitely get the truffle aioli on whatever you order. 

Don't bother ordering a salad-meh. The hub got a buffalo burger which was also just meh. Our friends ordered the regular hamburger patty and I would say that and the veggie burger were my favorites. 

We didn't try any shakes because we were too full (wamp wamp). Beer was good, but I would pass on the mixed drinks-they were not anything special."}
{"text":"Seriously impressed. Burgers that have out there ingredients but work so damn well. Peanut butter and habanero jelly on a burger?! Amazing. Aged beef and the elk were phenomenal as well. Milkshakes were of course amazing. The service was a tad slow but man they are good. Guiding you through the menu and your selection. All around, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Their shakes are delicious and a meal in themselves. The IPA cheese fries are delicious and the burgers are cooked to perfection. This place makes me fat kid happy."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentines day,the wait was over 2 hours long but it was certainly worth the wait. 

Im not much of a burger eater (more of a chicken/steak guy) but this was certainly one of the best restaurant burgers i have ever eaten. I love the option to build your own burger the way you want it. You pick your meat,bun,cheese,rubs,toppings etc. Great choices for anyone looking to get a high quality burger at a reasonable price. 

My only complaints would be the rather cramped dining area and the waitress that we had was not the greatest,we went for long periods of time without her asking if we needed anything.

Overall a great experience and as mentioned before one of the best burgers I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Small place but good food. If your looking for exotic burgers like Elk or Bison this is the place!. You can also make your own burger. A little pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"This is an upscale burger place that serves beer & cocktails. Our bison burgers were very good & prepared well. The homemade chips were dull, though, & the chocolate milk shake was disappointing because it didn't have much flavor. I don't mind paying steep prices for excellent food, but this place didn't clear the bar."}
{"text":"Burgatory was one of the burger places on my list when we moved to Pittsburgh. We had heard pretty good things about his place. So far they have continued to live up to the hype.

My go-to burger is the grass-fed patty with Angel Dust, bunch of veggies, whole grain mustard, and bacon. Sometimes I go with a bun and sometimes bunless. Just about every time it is cooked perfectly. I really enjoy the Angel Dust. When I specify \"Pink\" interior, it is pink; not rare or well-done. They have a great set of toppings, including cucumber which I really like.

Their chips are very good, a mix of sweet potato and regular potato. Fries are pretty good if not overwhelming. I often get a field greens salad instead of fries or chips and it is a nice change of pace:  mixed greens with pickled tomatoes, shaved parmesan cheese, and pine nuts. 

I generally don't get a shake, but my wife does. When I've tried one, each one has been very good. They have a small but well-thought out craft beer selection that seems to be rotated frequently.

There tends to be a long wait at any of their locations, so do yourself a favor and get the NoWait phone app. it lets you put yourself in-line for a table before you get there. Overall the interiors are basic but every server we've had has been terrific, particularly with our young daughter.

Burgatory is definitely in the top-3 of our Pittsburgh burger list."}
{"text":"Burgers were really good! We customized both of our burgers. 
We ordered nachos and their onion rings from their appetizer menu-- onion rings were huge and really good-- I think they even had a light layer of cheese in it! Nachos were a little soggy. They put too much of their sauce in it, so by the time we got it, all of it was soggy :( Plan on a long wait. Weekdays and weekends are really busy but I say it's worth the wait (*we waited about an hr + on a Friday) -- overall a good place and surrounded by a lot of shopping."}
{"text":"First of all, I sat at the bar since I was by myself.  I was not offered a menu, but saw the order forms in front of me.  Initially was going to order a burger and a shake, but without a menu, figured you couldn't get shakes at the bar, so I just ordered a coke and burger and fries.
I ordered my burger pink, with romaine lettuce, tomatoes,grilled onions, and bbq sauce.  The burger was TASTELESS.  Onions were non existent, as was the bbq sauce.  Fries were average. Got a refill on my coke without asking, then was offered a milk shake as a dessert (why oh why didn't I get a menu at all though?).  Don't know what the attraction of this place is.....personally when you walk in and stare at this big walk in freezer staring at you, you figure it is going to be reheated, microwaved crap.  These people figured out how to make it look nice, but it is a far cry from the burgers at the Squirrel Hill Cafe or Tessaros.  Not impressed.
And I would hide that walk in cooler if I was designing the room, especially if what I want to eat is FRESH food, not FROZEN."}
{"text":"I realize that it's a little odd for a vegetarian to be looking for something great to eat in a place called, \"Burgatory,\" but they did have some great revues and some even said the veggie burger was really good. My opinion, total BS! Started with $7 onion rings which consisted of ONLY 4 rings! Not bad, kind of bland..but, $7 for 4 onion rings...don't waste your money! The regular chocolate shake wasn't bad..nothing to write home about..but, ok...the veggie burger...one of the most BLAND tasting burgers I've ever had. I know that most meat eaters have no idea on how much seasoning it takes to make seeds and mushrooms  taste flavorful...and Burgatory proves my point. Between my wife and I, we dropped $48 on onion rings, 2 shakes and 2 burgers..Stay away from this one my Veggie friends!"}
{"text":"Oh my Oh my Oh my! One of those places I wish we had locally where we live!
We were in my husband's home town, and saw a sign on the highway for this place. Over to yelp of course to check out the reviews. Definitely put it on our try list while there.
You can design your own burger which I took advantage of. You fill out a slip and put what you want on it from the bun to the meat to toppings. 
Hubby went with a burger from the menu as they had some interesting ones to choose from.
We also ordered the truffled gorgozola pommes fries. WOW Again. I loved it all- from the little devilish stakes they put in your burger, to the atmosphere inside.
I also had one of their heavenly shakes with a huge marshmallow on top. 
If this is purgatory sign me up! 
Hubby finished off the meal by asking if I would consider moving here just for the place. While I give it high ratings, I think I will wait until they come south and build one here in Raleigh!"}
{"text":"Serious food and extremely intoxicating, I have eaten a piece of heavenly goodness, I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with a friend who is vegetarian so her choices are slim in the Waterfront. She really wanted to try the veggie burger and I decided to get a  vegetarian meal myself for a change!  

She loved her veggie burger; though I must mention it does contain cashews for those with a nut allergy. Also, if you are vegetarian, do not opt for the brioche bun as our waiter said it contains pork fat - who knew? The waiter was very nice and helpful while she was trying to build her sandwich.

I decided on the psychedelic mushroom 'Hand' (sandwich), which is a marinated (a teeny bit spicy) portobello mushroom on a burger bun with roasted red peppers, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and a garlic mayo spread! It also came with a side of lightly dressed salad greens. It was excellent! Hands down the best choice I have made a Burgatory and I would highly recommend not only to vegetarians but those who want to skip the burger and go for something less heavy! It doesn't hurt that a portobello mushroom is actually quite meaty and thick so you really don't miss the burger. 

The service was excellent and the price for 2 burgers and two drinks was less than $30- not bad for 2 large gourmet burgers with sides! 

The only down side was that it wasn't busy when we came in, but since we were only 2 people, they stuck us at a tiny table that is extremely close to the table next to it so I had a hard time squeezing through the other side. I guess they set it up like that because it is a smaller space and they want to be able to seat a good bit of people but when another party sits next to you, you are basically right in their conversation and vice versa. I guess I should get used to it though as I have noticed a lot of modern restaurants doing this. It is a bit unfortunate because when I go out to eat I do want a smudge of privacy and freedom to talk about whatever.

If you haven't already, check this place out! Especially in the summer, where you can sit outside at a nice patio area!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night for dinner around 6pm and it was packed. We had to wait for about 30-45 minutes for a party of 6. Luckily, there are a lot of shops nearby and you can walk around until they text you that your table is ready.

Pros: The food is not bad. I got a custom made burger with beef, whole wheat bun, garlic mayo, romaine, red onion, tomato, and jalapenos. The meat was cooked perfectly (we chose \"pink\") and got the chips as the side. 

Cons: EXPENSIVE. You're gonna be paying about $11-15 for a burger that doesn't even come with fries. The free side is chips, but if you want fries or any other side you have to pay extra. The burgers are also pretty small, especially for the price you're paying. We also got the nachos, and they were not very good. I could've made better nachos myself. 

Overall: I don't see what all the hype is about. Burgatory is overpriced and the food is alright, since my burger was good but small and pricey, but the nachos were terrible."}
{"text":"I wish I could dock a point here for the chips (what is this new trend of chips with burgers???) but I just can't. The milkshakes more than make up for the disappointing sides. 

Burgatory is one of my favorite places to go - just make sure to get your name in 1-2 hours earlier than you actually want to eat (sometimes, when it's \"slow\", you can get away with a half-hour wait). The burnt almond torte milkshake is amazing - definitely the best milkshake of my life. The whipped cream is amazing, too. I have no idea what the secret ingredient is that makes it so thick and fluffy, but I think it has something to do with angel's tears.

I actually usually skip ordering a burger in favor of getting an appetizer - Just Fork It is my favorite. A milkshake + appetizer at Burgatory is more than enough food for one person. I usually walk away stuffed. Plus, frankly, skipping a burger means I'm not saddled with sad, awful chips."}
{"text":"Well, despite all of the hype I heard about this place I wasn't overly impressed. The restaurant was clean and the service was quick. I had the farmer brown burger, and it was ok, kinda dry actually. My wife had the fork it and she said it was fine, I don't think she cared for the gravy. She also had the Éclair don't Care shake. She liked it, but once again wasn't blown away.

I'm probably one of the few people to not be super excited about this place, it's just my opinion, so take it for what's it's worth."}
{"text":"A fancy burger place that does not really match the price tag. Went here with my girlfriend for a burger, they have some exotic ass burgers with crazy meats like buffalo and elk... So the waiter askew my gf how she want the meat done, yet forgets to ask me and gives me a medium cooked burger. Tasted alright but somewhat undercooked... I did like the jalepeño jelly as a sauce and the fries but how can you mess that up. 


Bottom line 5 guys makes a way better burger and is virtually half the price twice the taste and the same heart attack..."}
{"text":"If your craving a good REAL burger, this place is it! They have hormone free beef, buffalo, wagyu, crab burgers, chicken burger, Elk and veggie burgers too. I had the morty's steakhouse burger $11 and my husband had the Elk $13.5. The burgers come with these russet and sweet potato chips that make a great salty and sweet combo! They have their own creations but  if your not feeling it, create your own burger. You choose how you want it cooked. These burgers are just plain juicy, flavorful and worth the price. Popular place it seems and great spot for lunch. Didn't try the shakes but they look awesome and you can choose from alcohol or non-alcohol shakes. Friendly waiters and nice atmosphere.  Kick it at the bar and enjoy the game or hang out with the family at a table."}
{"text":"You know that good puke feeling you sometimes get...when you stuff your face with so much awesomeness that your stomach doesn't have time to catch up and tell your brain to stop eating or you'll explode awesomeness everywhere...well my Burgatory experience was something like that.  But thankfully I didn't explode but felt like I was going to but in the good kinda way.  

All I had previously heard about Burgatory was the awesome burgers and shakes so this is what I was determined to try.  I sat at the bar - there was no wait - and ordered the caramel pretzel shake.  How its even possible to capture pure ecstasy in the form of a shake I'll never know, but that's what it was!  It had pieces of crunchy (not soggy) pretzels throughout and with the subtle sweetness of caramel.  

I should mention that I restrained myself from inhaling the shake because I had a burger coming that I also wanted to savor.  So after a few large sips, I pushed it to the side anxiously waiting for my custom burger.  Beef patty with peppercorn rub, bourbon bbq, smoke gouda, grilled 'shrooms, arugula and tomato on a wheat bun.  

As you can imagine, I felt like I was in Burgatory purgatory waiting for my burger while restraining my whole body from downing the shake.  So after about 20 minutes, I was getting a bit impatient but I told myself to calm the heck down.  But then I noticed that the girl who sat next to me at the bar, but arrived 10 minutes after I did, got her burger.  Then there was a couple across the bar who must have arrived 15-20 minutes after I did who got their food.  At this point it must have been 35-40 minutes with no burger.  My will power to stop drinking the shake had diminished about 20 minutes before so the shake was nearly done.  

Now here's a situation which had the potential to be an awful experience and a potential 1-2 star Yelp rating.  But this is how it was saved!  The manager came up to me and apologized for the delay in my food and that she would make sure it comes out as soon as possible.   About 10 minute later, there was my burger all ready for me to eat.  I was told by the waitress that their computer system had crashed right when they entered the order so it must have never gone through.  

The manager came to check on me to make sure everything was ok and I said that it was.  She then told me that my whole meal was on them!  Wow - now that's customer service.  While there was a part of me that felt entitled to at least have them discount or comp the burger, I didn't expect them to take care of the shake as well.  To me that was way beyond my expectations but made me really like this place all that much more.    

The burger and shake were fantastic and I highly recommend checking this place out.  I know I will!

I wish I could have left them an awesome tip but didn't have any cash on me so the next time I go I'll be extra generous with my tip!  I mean really it has to be a sin to eat food that good and not pay for it!"}
{"text":"Burgatory is very good. Sometimes the service can be a touch off, but nothing crazy. 

The burgers are very good and very consistent. The best thing about this location at least is the Happy Hour from 4-6. 

They do $5 appetizers and cheaper cocktails and drafts. Since the apps are around $8-10 normally and are quite large you can easily go to dinner here without paying full Burgatory prices. The fried ribs are friggin' awesome and during happy hour they're a steal. 

Prices are the only downside to Burgatory in my opinion. I get tired of spending $15 a burger before tax and tip, and without adding anything extra like a shake. 

The shakes are also amazing and can even be customized if you ask for it. No doubt, despite the prices, getting a burger and a shake here is pretty much heaven. 

Seating is great in the summer too since they have open windows and semi-open areas for fresh air. 

People on this side of the river are very happy they joined the Waterfront and put some pressure on the mega-corp chains that inhabit the area!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our experience. Waited about 40 minutes for a table. Servers were friendly and professional. Like the way you customize the burgers. Tried the wagyu and veggy burgers. Both were very nice. Everything was fresh and tasty. Nice fries and side options. Cost was inline with similar places. $35 for two burger combos (burger with 3 toppings, fried and pop), plus tip. Nice setting. Overall, this place is nicer than Red Robin, which has gone down hill. I plan to return soon!"}
{"text":"Bison Burger was amazing and the Smores shake was even better. Great place to eat, just be prepared to wait for a table - waited 35 minutes for a table on Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Warning: Plan on doing NOTHING following your meal at Burgatory.

I had been to Burgatory once before.  It was post Thanksgiving Day, I believe that Sunday.  And after an overeating type of holiday I figured my food coma was driven by leftover turkey and the massive milkshake I got here.  So my plan of attack for my second visit was to have a light breakfast and steer clear of the delivious milkshake options.  The first part of the plan was followed, what happened after I blame on the restaurant.  

We sat at the bar and got some really good drinks.  Mine was the Deuces Wild Lemonade.  Incredibly refreshing and had that nice good kick to it (this means it was nice and strong). After a nice short wait we were seated at a booth.  I was on cocktail #2 at that point.  Our server was Sara(h?) and she was really good.  Very friendly and had some good reccs.  We had to kids with us and she was helpful with them too.  I had the Morty's Steakhouse Burger and it was really good.  After another cocktail, our meal was complete.... oh except one of the kids did not finish their shake.  Guess who had some of it.... yup.  Needless to say the rest of the day was pleasantly unproductive.  Yeah that's a good description for it.  

Seriously... next time I won't get a shake.  Oh who am I kidding."}
{"text":"Had high hopes and really looked forward to our first visit.  Service ended up being extremely slow, burger was, well an over priced burger that didn't wow anyone in our group, and the shakes were more whipped cream than shake.  Don't think we'll be back when we are in town again."}
{"text":"Went here for first time as it was a on a top 5 burger list in Pittsburgh. Big burger that was cooked as ordered. The meat didn't have much beef flavor! Next time I'll try a different burger from the list. My best burger is the triple-prime @ Ruby Tuesday. Next up on the list will be Eleven."}
{"text":"I feel like I've been waiting forever to go to Burgatory. I was reading reviews like some people read trashy romance novels. Lusting over descriptions of meaty juicy burgers and grown up milkshakes. Let me rephrase that DECADENT grown up milkshakes.

I don't know when I became so impatient, but the 75 minutes wait felt like ETERNITY. I think my biggest issue is that now that restaurants use a text or call to your cell phone, it often times seems as if people are just walking in and being sat before us. The weather was mild though so sitting outside on the bench was nice. 

The interior, while small is very hip and clean. Great signs and branding through the space. Concrete and brick floors and high ceilings. It does follow along with the current trend of very dark eateries though, I don't want buzzing fluorescent lighting but I would like to see my food when it comes out.

My all opted for Build Your Own burgers. Two of us getting beef while the other two got veggie burgers. I ordered mine red inside and it was mostly pink. I would have been surprised if it had come out red inside though as most places don't want to accommodate that. Everything about the burger was great from the flavor of the meat (no rub) to the huge slice of pineapple, to the sharp provolone cheese, and Bourbon BBQ sauce. 

Honestly, even this morning all I can think about is the red velvet cupcake milkshake with cake infused vodka in it. I can still taste it. Topped with whipped cream and a red velvet cake lollipop dipped in  chocolate and a cherry pie filling type drizzle.

Our waitress was very attentive, the food came very quickly, and while our friends who had the veggie burgers didn't seem stoked on the mushy texture, I couldn't have been happier with my meal."}
{"text":"Best burger I have EVER had.... in a restaurant!! 

Atmosphere/decor: (5/5) I LOVE the decor and the whole atmosphere of the restaurant. It was very modern and definitely a place to hang out for any age group.  The crowd is very eclectic which made me like the restaurant more. Its not everyday you would see college kids, a group of little girl blowing bubbles in their milkshakes, biker dudes, and super old people in the same restaurant and none of them look out of place. I was kind of upset when I found the place because I'm in Aspinwall all the time and I never noticed Burgatory before. It was like a hidden treasure. Now I understand why Barnes and Noble's parking lot is always full! You know that feeling when you realize you are the last one to find out something... that's how I feel right now! lol   

Service : (5/5) Initially it took a while for our waiter to take our orders but that was because of a mistake he made with another table. Even though he couldn't help us right away, another waitress was there to order our drinks and he kept checking in just to let us know that he wasn't neglecting us. After the problem was resolved, he was SUPER attentive. Our food took longer than expected but that was my fault... I ordered my burger VERY well done a.k.a burnt. lol 

Random but I also like to add that pretty much all the staff were very pretty/handsome... kudos to the hiring manager. My waiter was ridiculously attractive but he was gay so I didn't feel guilty for staring instead of listening when he was talking to us. lol I swear if Brad Pitt had a brother it would be him! Ok, I'm done...

Food: (5/5) First of all they had there own style of fries which was great! They sprinkled garlic salt over the top of them. I absolutely hate thick burgers but this was definitely an exception. I got the custom burger  - hormone free beef ( the name kinda gross me out), avocado, pickles, lettuce, apple? bacon, and Cajun rub. The seasoning of the burger was excellent! It taste like a burger I would have at a bbq. It really made me curious what the other seasonings taste like. They put several pieces of thick bacon on the burger so that was great. 

My husband got the special which was a ANTELOPE burger! My husband likes eating strange meat so he was very excited about it. He loved it! Any place that is able to put antelope meat, blue cheese, beets, herbs(instead of lettuce) together and make it taste good is 5 stars worthy in my book. 

Oh yea... I really want to go back for a milkshake because they looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Good burger and delicious beer. 
Interesting options and choices. 
Not spectacular. But satisfying."}
{"text":"We always eat at a Burgatory when in Pittsburgh. We used the app to get on the waiting list ahead of time and were seated quickly. Our Gorgonzola fries were delicious! I tried the crab cake sandwich this time, which was good but I probably wouldn't order again. Burgers and shakes are always great. Our waitress didn't offer our kids their cherry floats, but they didn't clear their plates either (not sure how strict that policy is). Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"In the past 5 days I've been there twice because I just can't get enough. The first visit I ordered a custom bison burger with the  sriracha remoulade & cracked peppercorn rub... Delicious. My boyfriend had the \" Meat Your Maker\" and he said it was \"a culinary orgasm\".  
On our second visit we decided to split a Meat Your Maker and the burger of the day which happened  to be a duck patty, with duck confit, sautéed onions, tomato jam, and bacon. What a GREAT decision. We also had Herb's Grape Refresher, it wasn't too sweet and had a wonderful taste.
 
Our server was Cindy and she was fantastic, she put up with my boyfriends odd jokes and made sure we were happy at all times! 

The wait is worth it! These people know what tastes go well together and I look forward to their future creations."}
{"text":"I've been going to Burgatory for years and it's always my first choice in Pittsburgh for a good burger. I've tried their burgers with beef, bison, elk and crab. All I really enjoyed! I usually like to build my own burger which does add up. By the time I add fries my burger is around $17-$18. 

However, I always forget that if you're a fan of just a little pink you have to tell them no pink. 

The shakes are always really good too! They do change them up so I was a little sad that the coffee and donut shake wasn't on the menu this trip!"}
{"text":"Great food and FANTASTIC service from Jenna! Definitely will be back. The burgers were so good and for appetizer we got the nachos.... amazing! 
The cookie sundae was a perfect ending."}
{"text":"Great first time to this Burgatory location.  The staff is very competent and they are on their A-game, which is impressive b/c it's so new.  Go with the bison burger!!!  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Sub par service. We waited 7 minutes for our server to greet us. She failed to mention her name and seemed uninterested in serving us. My husband asked for a salad with ranch, came out wrong. To be followed up with the new salad and the burgers at the same time...not cool. No apology, no words. A table next to sat down and she immediately greeted them. We usually always love Burgatory but this time was awful and we won't be back for a while, we will make the trip to the Robinson location any day over the north side location."}
{"text":"Simply put: Amazing burger selection (from the actual meat [or not] itself to the topings) and they're all completely delicious. Seriously the best burgers I've ever had in Pittsburgh for sure."}
{"text":"Great food & drinks & shakes are great too. I've been to most Burgatorys & this one is nice due to generally short waits even on Fri/Sat night. We'll be going there regularly when hungry for some red meat.  Its one of the best North Shore options for a casual meal."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh!   Either get one of their menu burgers or choose your own.   They have tons of choices of meat, bun, cheeses, rubs, sauces, and toppings.   If you really want to feel stuffed get one of their milkshakes which your meal as well."}
{"text":"Who would give this place less than five stars? This place has the best gluten free buns and milkshakes I have ever had. There is never a wait for any Burgatory location I've been to either. The service is good, the food is perfect, what is there to complain about? Well, I suppose the fact that it is such a filling meal is disheartening, as I usually can't finish both a burger AND a milkshake. But you can always box up the burger if you fear not being able to finish both."}
{"text":"I love the other Burgatory restaurants in the area and was excited to see one coming to a closer area to my home. I  was a regular at the Waterfront until it got old and stale, now Burgatory gives me a reason to go here again.

The new Burgatory is small. That said, I expected a long wait Sunday, the day after the grand opening. Getting there around five, I was seated at 6:17. There was no room at the bar, so we went across the street to a somewhat empty Bar Louie. 

New restaurant, you expect issues, slow service, getting drinks right, billing issues. Surprisingly, there were no issues like that. My portabello mushroom cap on a whole grain burger bun, with radicchio, grilled onions, angel dust, mushrooms and garlic aioli was perfect, the side salad was fresh and delicious. The only issue I ran into was the fact the waiter didn't know if that had fat free ice cream or fat free yogurt to make an adult milkshake. This was no problem, I settled for water with lime. Who needs the extra calories? Kudos for Burgatory for having a properly trained staff for a grand opening! 

One problem I see here, and it's been a problem at the waterfront for years.... PARKING. This is why I gave it only three stars. There were no issues with the food or overall service. The burgatory will be competing for parking spots not only with Bar Louie, the theater, Bravo's but also with the other shops and the Starbucks. No restaurant in this location before Burgatory has had any luck, I wish Burgatory well and hope they break the string of bad luck this location has had."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's one of my favorite Burgh Burger burgeries (see what I did there?) and I want to review and attend each and everyone. This was a take out order, the web sight made it easy to order a build your own burger. Portobello mushroom cap, whole wheat bun, truffled shallot aioli, angel dust, organic field greens, baby spinach, poblano peppers, and arugula with a side salad was my order. A coworker ordered the peanut butter and jelly burger, another, an order of wings.

They actually got the order right, something that is unusual for the north shore eateries. The burger was perfect as was peanut butter and jelly burger. My side salad was delicious. I've always been amazed at Burgatory's ways of making a simple side salad extra special. Even in a take out order!"}
{"text":"Like its older brother out off of rt. 28, this burger joint boasts a charged energy feel inside, off the chart high end burgers, a great beer selection and adult milk shakes. 

You can build your own burger with lots of imaginative toppings, cheeses, buns and breads, rubs, sauces, and if you're not feeling the hormone free beef, try the free range chicken, bison, lump crab, or go vegan with a grilled portobello or black bean veggie patty. 

I had the grilled portobello on a whole wheat bun, grilled problano peppers, fresh spinach, arugula, and micro greens. My rub was Cajun, and I topped it off with a truffle aioli. 

I thank the Burger Gods from above that the Robinson store opened because now I don't have to travel the god forsaking route 28 to go to the store near Fox Chapel. Burgatory can stand up to those burger joints you see on TV across the nation, no gimmicks here, none of that 25 pound burger challenge, just honest to goodness ingredients at a great price."}
{"text":"So Canadian friend of Joe (CFOJ) came in to visit his old buddy before heading off to Philly on business and he calls me from the hotel and says \"I need dead cow meat! I want it on a fluffy bun and I want it rare and I want a side of home made chips to scarf down my gullet, eh?\" Okay I added the \"eh\" part, because oddly CFOJ never says eh, even though he hails from Vancouver. And he really didn't call saying I want dead cow, etc. He basically said \"hey let's go have a burger somewhere\". I needed a good intro as an attention grabber, my bad yo!

So a few minutes later I'm searching frantically on Yelp to find him a great burger joint and quickly remembered a new place in waterworks mall called \"Burgatory\". So I pick him up at the hotel and off to that place we go.

It's 6pm on a Friday night and the place is hopping like 4 frogs on a hot frying pan. I walk up to the desk and leave my name and cell phone number and they promise me in 75 minutes I'll be seated. Good thing there is a Barnes & Noble, TJMaxx and 5 Below close to shop at while your table waiting. Well in the time we went shopping, I got three texts from Burgatory giving me updates and believe it on not on the 75th minute, a text came and the table was ready, how do they do that???

We are seated, I order a Sam Adams, and the waitress explains to us to grab a worksheet and check off what we want our burgers to look like when they come out. Let me explain, you pick the type of meat (beef, chicken, crab cake, bison, or vegan) bun (white, wheat, foccocia etc) then there are different dry rubs, toppings, veggies, etc. It's pure genius! And for those of you not enterprising enough to grab a little bowling pencil and build a burger, they have pre existing burgers in the menu you can order. I love this place!

I order a veggie burger, with Cajun rub, fresh spinach, Spanish onion, grainy mustard, and horseradish cheddar. CFOJ decided he wanted a plain cheese burger with good old American cheese and bacon. But he was as giddy as an ugly school girl with prom date to see the long list of milk shakes on the menu and ordered the s'mores shake. It came with a huge toasted marshmallow on top of the whipped cream, it looked better than it tasted. He loved it, I wasn't impressed because to me a milk shake should be creamy, where this shake was gritty with ground up graham crackers in it. I'll stick with Sam Adams.

One thing about restaurant made veggie burgers, they all seem to fall apart, and no surprise here, Burgatory's did too. Great flavor, a bit dry, seems like it was mostly grains (oatmeal, onions, herbs) I wish a restaurant would try tempeh or vital wheat gluten as a base to see if it will stay in one piece. The plate was also piled high with home made potato and sweet potato chips, not the least bit greasy and great crunch, almost like kettle chips. This place has great atmosphere, it can get a bit loud, and because it's new it may take awhile to get a table, but it's all worth it (yes, even driving the death trap called RT 28) so give Burgatory a try, this maybe the funnest time you have at a burger joint."}
{"text":"My previous experience with most food truck food has been it is over-hyped, not cheaper than stores, and it tastes from mediocre to average.  Hence, when I had to patronize a food truck during a music festival, I tried to get the least expensive food to get it done and over with.  My BF had other plans; he wanted a burger.  Alright, we would get one from Burgatory, the sole burger food truck on site.  

BF found it amusing that Burgatory named their burgers after three of the seven sins.  He went after the worst sin, hence the priciest burger on the menu (I was rolling my eyes at this point), that was the Greed.  We ordered a Greed burger ($12), and paid $4 extra made it a combo with Cajun fries and a pop.  I tried the fries first.  And all things Holy, the fries did taste Cajun.  These fries were cut to shoe strings and with skin on.  They were also fried to crispy.  The fries were so flavourful that ketchup was not needed.  

Moving on to the burger.  This was a gourmet burger in ingredients, freshness and taste.  It was fresh.  The bun was soft.  The beef patty was thick. There was a few long strips of *quality bacon*, the type you would buy for home.  I bit through the barbeque sauce, gooey cheese, caramelized onion, the bacon, then my teeth met the beef patty.  After it felt like a whole centimetre of quality ground beef, my teeth reached the bun and bit through it.  Moaned with food high.  Repeated the process.  

$12 might be steep for a burger, but the Greed could easily beat the products of some gourmet burger joints.  Together with the delicious Cajun fries, my BF and I were full, all for a mere $16.  And most of all, Burgatory gives me hope that maybe gourmet food trucks are not just a fad."}
{"text":"It's a tad corporate for my liking (i.e. reminds me of B-dub-dubs a bit), but other than the conventional environs, this was a very cool place. Only had time to stop for lunch in Pittsburgh, and I think I made an admirable choice.

Build your own burger is the way to go. For most things, they don't dock you more money. You can make a great burger for $10.50, which includes $9.50 for a beef burger and a buck for the cheese. If you're feeling in the mood for the wilder ingredients, you'll only suffer minor up-charges.

I really enjoyed the truffle aioli, the truffle rub, and the grilled mushrooms? See a pattern? I tell you, if you get all that stuff, you don't really need a bison burger or that admittedly clever \"fiddy-fiddy\" bacon burger. It's got enough flavor added to it, so dig into that good old fashioned beef burger, and get it PINK."}
{"text":"Burgertory in Moon township was the first restaurant I ate at when I moved to Pittsburgh from California. I believe it's the best you can get for the price. The vibe is energetic, the menu is fun and the staff is friendly. I feel these are general statements because each location I've been to share those qualities. This location is no different. If this is your first time, I believe the \"Meat Your Maker\" is the best first burger to try because it has high quality wagyu beef, great toppings and is a strong introduction to the restaurant. You should also order a shake and if you like vodka, I don't think you can go wrong with the Choco Taco. Lastly, just a little tip, save some $ by substituting the chips for fries. It's a little extra but it saves you from having to buy them as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Hands down best burger I have had.  I love that you can customize your burger.  I have food allergies and I was able to create what I wanted and it was FABULOUS!  Also tried their potato salad, it was ok.  Burger made up fir it.  Some of the potatoes weren't cooked all the way.  Our waitress was AWESOME.  Every employee seemed to enjoy their job.  It was a very busy day because of the college game at Heinz.  Our food was quick to our table and we were a party of 11"}
{"text":"My bff accompanied me to the Waterfront this past Saturday for some shopping. My friend, fellow yelper Carrie W, has had burgers from Burgatory before, just not this location. We have tried, unsuccessfully, on two other occasions to eat here. However, the wait was simply too long. One Saturday night at 7:30 the wait was an hour and a half....and I simply refuse to wait that long for any meal.

We lucked out this weekend, however. It was 3pm, and I was hoping that there wouldn't be much of a wait, if any, since it was neither lunch or dinner time. We did have a wait, but it wasn't more than 10 minutes. The hostess offered to text my friend when our table was ready, which gave us the freedom to shop around instead of just standing around.

The food was delicious. We both opted to create our own burger. I chose the All Natural Chicken on a Whole Wheat bun, Angel Dust rub and Horseradish Cheddar cheese....which was yummy!....as well as some veggie toppings and ranch on the side. My friend got the Dry Aged Wagyu burger, also on a Whole Wheat bun. Both of us opted for the salad instead of sweet potato fried chips, for an up-charge of $1.50. Totally worth it. The salads came out with the burgers, and took up the majority of the plate. Not some cheap salad with iceburg lettuce and croutons. Oh, no. Mixed greens with tomatoes, nuts, cheese....and the balsamic dressing was good too.

Our waiter was friendly and attentive, as much as you can be when the place is packed. The only downsides I would say came from my friend's side. She ordered her burger medium rare, which is certainly was not (no pink at all, in fact). However, she did say that it was tasty, regardless. Also, IPAs are $8....pricey. Sorry, maybe I'm just a little on the cheap side.

Overall, I enjoyed my meal. The only real negative is that this place is simply too small and, really, not the coziest. Anyone who has read my past reviews knows that I am a fan of comfort. There are a lot of tables and most of the booths are those half booths, with one side being a bench seat and the other a regular old chair. I do think that Burgatory will be a success, despite their being so many failed businesses in this spot previously. That being said, add more comfy booths and expand. Other than that, great place for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"The reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the burgers were good but service was mediocre... We sat at the bar and had a female bartender. She was friendly but didn't really pay any attention to us, our food took forever, I ordered the Rosemarie cocktail the first one was great so I ordered another but the second one was different!? No cucumber WAY too sweet just inconsistent. Not only that but all the servers where lounging around socializing waiting for the food to come out, it's like is this social hour? Can I get some water and a refill?  Also our bartender bounced out right when we were finished with our meal, no word just grabbed her coat and left? Ok bye? Lol So we waited like 20 min just for the bill and when it came it was disappointing. Too much for this place. NOT worth the price. Never coming back. Un enjoyable. Get your shit together. Boooooo"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Little on the pricy side and not too freindly on the coloric intake. but none the less you have to put the calorie counter and wallet watcher on hold for this. IT IS WORTH IT. 

 so ive been here twice..ill go off the last time i was here...

  i ordered the bison burger. they have an array of different condomentsand toppings that you really do not see anywere else. so i kind of forget what else i got on it but it is def a burger i will never forget. it was so...how can i say this....PERFECT. staff was rock solid..even going in late on the 4th of july i kind of felt like an @hole. this place is def, on my list of go backs. 

AMAZING, HATS OFF BURGATORY"}
{"text":"Stopped in to try their food and it was absolutely amazing!  We all got the Create Your Own Burger and everything came out exactly as ordered. The burgers were juicy and delicious. We got chips, fries, and the potato salad for our sides and all of them were fresh and delicious. My daughters wanted a caramel pretzel shake to split and they were nice enough to put it into two separate cups. They said the shake was the best one they'd ever had.  Our waitress was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Great find. Would definitely come back. And eat nachos. Lots of nachos. Burgers looked great and excellent happy hour menu. Did I mention the nachos?"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and it was pretty lonely. Not very busy at all. The staff was very friendly, but they were somewhat slow and lacked a sense of urgency. It took bout 10 minutes for me to get my beer that I ordered. When you're craving a beer on a hot afternoon, you kind of want that beer right away. 

We ordered 2 burgers. I ordered their Mortys Steakhouse because burger and unfortunately didn't enjoy it much. The horseradish cheddar overpowered the burger and didn't go well with the haystack onions. I've never been a fan of haystack onions, so I'm not really sure why I ordered this burger. My other option would have been the Piggy Butter & Jelly Burger, but my wife ordered that one. That one tasted a lot better. Candied bacon, habanero jelly. Really can't beat that. If I were ever to return, I would definitely order that one."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good all things considered.  It's a cool space that's well layed out.  However, much like the Build-a-Bear workshop, having a million options doesn't make a cool looking bear.  It usually ends up with a bear that has a paw where his wang should be, and is dressed like a cross between a policeman, a princess, and the devil himself.

It was my own fault that I built the most structurally challenged burger in the universe, but I feel like our waiter should have stepped in at some point and said, 'just because the toppings are free, doesn't mean you have to put them all on one burger you jack ass.'

One hilarious bite later, and I had squirted every topping I had right into my basket.  This left me with a hang dog expression, and a naked burger.  The burger itself was really good (pepper crusted bison), but my recommendation is give one of the pre-made one's a shot.  Morty's steakhouse was the one that my friend raved about.  We also got the mushroom tempura and some crazy fries, both of which were relatively good, but seemingly had been sitting on the warmer for a pretty long time.

They also have alcoholic milkshakes, but ours were so thick, that it felt like I was being punished for ordering them.  I will definitely go back once the crazy crowds die down to get a better sense of this place.  There really are a ton of burger options to be explored."}
{"text":"Absolutely worth all the hype! Probably one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life! Staff was superb!"}
{"text":"*****For vegetarians/vegans and people with shellfish allergies.******

This is about a waitress and her devastating french fry reveal.  My husband and I enjoy Burgatory, up until Saturday 6/2/18, our server went out of her way to ask my husband if he was vegan/vegetarian, (he ordered the impossible burger)of which he is vegetarian. 

She asked him if he was ok with cross contamination. We looked at each other with fear, like what is she talking about? She proceeded to tell us the French fries, of which we eat a lot of are fried in the same grease as the chicken wings and crab cakes. 

I saw my husbands face, he was blown away that he had been eating them all this time. Her approach was rough to say the least, she said she was letting him know because she herself is Vegan.

I had no idea the fries bathed with meat products, they can cook however they want to, but if you offer vegetarian options, one would assume there would be vegetarian/vegan fries. Most restaurants do have veg options for fries.   

I wrote to Burgatory, they said they'll make sure they convey the fryer sharing with their customers and they make sure they keep their employees up to speed. I have nothing against Burgatory, in fact we will miss them. I really wish they would invest in getting several fryers to accommodate all their customers."}
{"text":"Came here for a Steelers game as an overflow from Bettis Grill (which was standing room only) & am so glad we stopped in!!

Got a great booth so that both of us could see the game clearly on the side of the bar. 

We started with the Mike's scratch margarita-BF had the reg one I added jalapeños. It was ok. 

Next we got the nachos & we inhaled them. So good!! I think there was chili on them but not sure. I really enjoyed them & felt the toppings were ample. 

I tried the Rosemary's smash gin & cucumber drink next & it was so yummy!! I had about 5 more :)

My BF tried the Killer P & kept ordering them.

I had the Morton's Steakhouse, loved it. By the time I got my burger I was pretty drunk so I can't go in to too much detail cuz I don't remember :)

BF did a customer burger & ate it in 3 bites so that's a good sign lol.

I would've loved to try a shake but my tummy was too full."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review of Burgatory yet!! Maybe because every time I visit, I experience a food coma and when I awake can't remember anything that happened while I was there...

The food here is great.  We like coming here because the husband is a big meat fan and their veggie burgers are homemade and fantastic, which I like.  I feel like I can't give a comprehensive review because I think I've only ever ordered \"create your own\" versions of the veggie burger!

All their shakes are amazing, but I was especially a fan of the vegan one they offered as a special a few weeks ago...keep 'em coming, even if it's just on veggie Tuesdays!

Definitely reccomend this place, but plan ahead as there is usually a wait--even on weeknights."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Sunday around noon for lunch with my fiance.  I have been to Burgatory before but not in a long time and never to this location.  As we were walking towards the front door of the place we noticed that they have quite a nice outdoor seating area.  We were seated immediately upon walking in the door but I noticed that there was only one other table free.  That table also quickly filled up and by the time that we left there were many groups of people waiting for a table.  The inside of the restaurant has a sleek and industrial feeling with a bar and a number of TV's near the tail end of the restaurant which is next to the outdoor seating and then the bulk up the main seating near the front with a fun flow chart on the wall.

For my lunch entree I ordered the make you own burger for which they have order forms on the table which you complete using their check boxes.  There are about 7 section with the first section being the meat you want, second bun, third cheese, fourth sauces, etc.  I ended up choosing the hormone free beef (cooked pink) with peppercorn crust on a whole wheat bun topped with siracha remoulade, cheddar, banana peppers, poblano peppers, dill chips and romaine lettuce.  Their burgers also come with a side of chips which you can upgrade to a better side for a little more money.   I chose to do that with the quinoa salad.  Our meals came out within a reasonable time period complete with devil pitch fork holding the hamburgers together and they looked good.  My burger was cooked as ordered and I enjoyed the taste of the patty.  What was disappointing with it was that the siracha remoulade had no discernible spice to it and the flavor of my cheese got lost in the myriad flavors of the burger.  I can't say too much about the latter though as I did choose all of the toppings myself.  The real winner of my lunch actually ended up being the quinoa salad.  It consisted of red quinoa, green/red/yellow bell peppers, pineapple and surprisingly some lemon juice which added the perfect amount of acidity to make the salad really enjoyable.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  The food was good, especially the meat for the burger and quinoa salad, and I love the number of different toppings available for the build your own burger."}
{"text":"Today was truly awful. I spoke to the bartender about temperatures. Based on her information I ordered a naked burger , not pink. She assured me the burger would not be charred or burned. The burger came fully burned. I know the bar tendered didn't cook it but since we did have a conversation specifically noting that the burger would not be burned, she should have checked. She offered to bring another but I respectfully declined. Seriously how hard is it to cook a burger medium or medium well?"}
{"text":"Great beer selection,
But the food is complete crap.
I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"A bit pricy, but dependable quality food and decent service. The milkshakes are a high point of any visit and be sure to ask about the featured shake or burger. Definitely one of the strongest restaurants to check out in the waterfront."}
{"text":"The food & shakes are amazing!! Do the custom burgers you will not be sorry. I was in town from Cleveland and I will go back again for the burgers."}
{"text":"I live in a very small town. I know a few places you can get a good Burger and some places where you should not get a Burger. I have had burgers from all over North America and a few from Europe. So when a friend told me that Burgatory made the best burgers I decided to give it a try. Business took me down this road and I ended up here, with a hunger for some tasty cow. There was a small wait (6:00PM on a Friday, what should you expect), but before long I was seated and trying to sort out my burger.

I elected to make my own with a Wheat roll, sautéed Mushrooms, Garlic Mayo, a few veggies, and of course some beef. My order came up pretty quickly and I was treated to one of the best burgers I have had in a restaurant. It was cooked perfectly, the toppings were all fresh, and they didn't over do or under do the toppings. Having eaten 100 burgers in a couple dozen cities was this burger the best I have ever had? No, but it is in the top 5 easy. Burgatory isn't just good, it is great. I will be stopping here again on my next time through."}
{"text":"Just didn't care for it. Didn't like the wings, the kids didn't  even like it. They loved the root beer floats that were free to them. That was nice."}
{"text":"I usually love the food and environment at Burgatory, so when my immediate and extended family visited Pittsburgh, I wanted to bring them. 

It was a Monday afternoon. The restaurant was not very busy. We asked the hostess to seat a table of twelve, but more family members arrived after being seated. We then asked the hostess if we can add more tables to fit everyone. She looked at my aunts and uncles with a look of disdain. Another family member then rephrased the request to move more tables. She responded in a disrespectful tone saying \"I don't understand what you guys are saying or what you need.\"

My family was a large party, so I bet it was overwhelming. However, the hostess came off very rude and unwelcoming. She did not offer to help move additional tables or did not even attempt to understand what we were trying to convey. The looks she gave my family and tone of voice that she used was disheartening. 

Besides that, food was great as usual."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go. Love making my own burger combo and always have to get a milkshake. Service is usually good and prompt. Nice atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend late to get a bite before heading to the airport to pick up her sister. We sat at the bar and experienced great service. I had an order of French fries and the Nutella milkshake plus a cup of coffee to keep me awake for another couple hours. Everything was good and arrived quickly which surprised me since they were still rather busy at 9:30pm. 
My lady friend ordered a burger and fries which she said was good and not too greasy. She did however not realize it came with a special sauce (mayo based) and therefore did not eat anything that the mayo came in contact with. I wasn't surprised by this since she can be rather persnickety. 
I'm looking forward to returning and trying the impossible burger since I'm veg."}
{"text":"Stopped here to grab a bite after the airport. Service was good, food was terrible. I ordered the fried chicken salad supposedly tossed in ranch. The ranch was barely drizzled on it. The worst part... My chicken had a rubbery texture to it and it literally tasted like I was eating salt from a salt shaker. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend to try out their burgers and milkshakes.  I've heard a lot of great things about them and finally got a chance to try it.  The restaurant is fairly large with a nice modern feel to it. It was fairly crowded in there for it being a Wednesday night which was good to see.

We ordered fries with parmesan cheese for an appetizer and those were fairly decent.  I had a burger and some deviled egg potatoes.  I absolutely love deviled eggs but really didn't find the potatoes that great as there wasn't really much taste to them.  The burger looked really good but turned out to be extremely greasy to the point where it made the bottom bun soggy and fall apart which really kind of ruined the burger for me. Lastly had a milkshake which was the best part. Definitely SPLIT the MILKSHAKE! They are HUGE!

If I ever come back it would be for a milkshake.  The menu is appealing to read but the food was rather disappointing.  I think there are plenty of places to get better burgers in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The place is cool and I love crowds- I just hate waiting forever and not being able to even get a drink while I wait.  Good burgers not the best in town, fun concept, very creative milk shakes we has a carmel and pretzel really good-  the onion rings were so greasy that I could not eat them the staff is so busy they did not notice that we hated the rings so I"}
{"text":"Ah, meat. I don't know what kind of voodoo Burgatory does with theirs, but they're doing it right. 
I've been to just about every other location, other than this one on the north side. I was happy to find myself finally here in awesome company on a beautiful evening in July.  We sat on the patio and were almost instantly greeted by our server. She didn't mention her name, I don't think, but I might have been too worried about catching the stupid zubat across the street to hear her say it. (Darn Pokemon.) 
She took our order quickly, and then came back with our waters. We got our food quickly, and ordered fries when the burgers arrived. The fries took forrreevvverrr. Like, done with my burger and waiting for the second coming of Christ, forever. Our server came over and wondered where they were, and disappeared. Ten minutes later she came back with them. Whatever. We ordered shakes when she dropped the fries off, and they took a good amount of time, especially with the diningroom being empty and only a few people outside and at the bar. But needless to say they were still amazing, and I downed mine quickly. 
No matter what glitches, I'm sure I'll be back since this is the closest one to my house! 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Nice burger, I was amazed by the first bite. But it was a little greasy afterwards. I had the peanut butter shake. It was toooo sweet for me. But to be honest, I do not have a sweet tooth, so my review may be biased. I cannot finish half of my meal because of the shake. Overall, a nice meal."}
{"text":"If you're a burger snob this is your place! A great selection of meats, toppings, and options make this the burger lovers choice. The Gorgonzola fries are to die for! And talk about milkshakes? If you want the best milkshake on the planet, this is your place. I highly recommend Burgatory. The only problem with Burgatory is that after three days you'll be hungry again."}
{"text":"All natural local antibiotic free meats and organic greens. Rave reviews from customer brought me here. The customize your own burger choices were Phenom! Farm Salad was fresh with tart balsamic roasted tomatoes was DEEELISH. High recommendation and look forward to another visit."}
{"text":"First time here and it was very good. Happy hour from 5-7 so I got the wings for $5, although I would have gotten them anyways. Big bucket of wings with great flavor and lots of meat.  I wasn't in the mood for a regular burger so I got the Elk. It was delicious. Surprised how juicy it was, not dry as some wild game can be. Melted in my mouth.  Reasonably priced. I wanted to get a shake but didn't have the room. I liked the option of regular or spiked shakes. I'll try one next time."}
{"text":"Waitresses dressed like Hooters servers. Burgers totally overrated. Did I mention the demeaning slogans on the waitresses' tees?

Have some self respect (and some respect for your servers) and go somewhere where the burgers are actually really great: Tessaro's."}
{"text":"I do enjoy this place. Not being able to eat ground beef, but love burgers, this gives me options...and the fact that I can create my own burger makes me happy. Both of us were quite happy with our chicken burgers, both made our own way, one on pretzel bun the other on brioche, both excellent choices,  the potato salad tasted old though, my chips were great, could've used more seasoning, but nice texture and crisp for fresh cut chips. Friendly waitress, kept excusing her reach...which could've been prevented had she gone to the other side of the table, where there was plenty of room to walk around and place drinks and food."}
{"text":"WHAT?  You've never been to Burgatory?  This was the cry of my friends when I sat down and asked what was good.  Turns out, pretty much everything.  

There are two highlights on the menu: the burger taking center stage, and the unbelievably good milkshakes.  

While there are several standard types of burgers you can order from the menu, the burger \"money\" is to use the order sheet and choose from the many selections of buns, condiments, and cheese.  One of my friends dining with us has a cheat sheet he brings with him so he can recreate the amazing burger he made on a previous visit.  It's that good.

My friends all had the salted caramel milkshake which they were generous enough to let me try - Ahh-ma-zing!  I opted for a nice craft beer that complimented my delicious burger.  

I'll be back."}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner at this murrysville location. The hostess sat us very quickly, we arrived around 5pm. Once we were seated everything went down hill fast! Our waitress must of forgot her personality at home. She never check on our drinks, brought us silverware or asked if we needed anything as we waited. The food..... So our food arrived and as I get ready to dig into mine.. What do I see.... A little extra flavor in MINE!! I huge HAIR!! Didn't look like human hair either, it looked dark black and white like someone's cat,dog or maybe even the freakin cow!!! I wanted to vomit, I get it stuff happens but check your food!! I never got a apology or nothing, just \"that will be taken off the bill\"! How about this burgatory, I didn't want a free burger I wanted a hairless burger and a nice dinning experience!! After all I'm a mother of 3 and wanted to enjoy not cooking for a evening, but instead I was stressed and grossed out!!"}
{"text":"Yay! So happy that this Burgatory location has finally opened!

My husband and I came here for a late night snack on Wednesday night, less than 2 weeks after they opened their doors for the first time. Since we've dined at the Robinson and Waterworks locations at least 8-10 times, we knew exactly what we wanted. However, I was surprised that service was initially quite slow. We were seated for 10 minutes before our waitress came over. She was extremely apologetic but told us that she needed to take another table's order and would be back as soon as possible. Even though placing our order took some time, our food did arrive promptly after we ordered.

I have given the other Burgatory locations 5 stars but can only rate this location 4 stars for now. Like the other locations, the food is delicious. I enjoyed some Truffled Gorgonzola Fries with a Salted Nutella Crunch Milkshake mixed up with Chocolate Vodka. Yum yum yum! The restaurant is also very well decorated, and this location feels more open than the other two, which I really like. However, the rating difference was the service. The waitresses that have helped us in other locations have all seemed very experienced and polished. The waitress that served us on Wednesday night was very sweet and apologetic about the meal's initial hiccups... but she was just very young and inexperienced. 

I will definitely be back - especially since I live less than 15 minutes away - but do hope that the service improves in the future."}
{"text":"The first time that my husband and I ate at this restaurant, we sat down, looked around, took a bite of our food, and determined that if we had ever created our own restaurant, it would be like Burgatory.

I had the opportunity of not only going to this restaurant a couple times but also going with a large group of people who are very open about passing food around for others to try. Needless to say, I've had the opportunity to try a lot of different things from the menu!

My favorite menu items? The Truffled Gorgonzola Pommes Frites were delicious and are a great item to share. Last time I went, I split the Farmer Brown burger - simple egg, ham, cheddar, lettuce and mayo burger - and could have definitely eaten more than half. Finally, most importantly --- THE SHAKES! My favorite is the Salted Nutella Crunch followed by the Caramel Pretzel and Espresso Love. I also enjoyed Grand-Dad's Secret because the bourbon flavor is very pronounced. Plus, even though a shake may be listed on the Classic menu, Burgatory will happily spike any shake for you.

Least favorite menu items? Really, only a salad (not sure which one) that my brother-in-law and his wife ordered. They said it was positively drenched in dressing and was practically inedible. 

Not only the food but also the marketing impresses at Burgatory. I've worked in retail for the last six years, so how a retailer or restaurant attracts a consumer is always forefront in my mind. Burgatory has fantastic marketing covering the walls of the restaurant and on the tables. It's not the sort of place that you leave and can't remember a month later what the name of the restaurant was....

All that to say, I love Burgatory, would recommend it to anyone, and will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"I have dined at the Burgatory location in the Waterworks plaza multiple times but have only eaten here once. I came with a large group (10-12, I think?) on a Wednesday evening, and the staff did a good job of getting us all seated within 30-45 minutes, even though some of the group was running late.

My husband, a friend, and I shared the Truffled Gorgonzola Pommes Frites. I had only been able to steal a few of these fries in the past, so I absolutely stuffed my face with them when I had a larger supply! By the time my Morty's Steakhouse burger arrived, I was almost completely full. Though I know it's one of Burgatory's most popular burgers, I did not really enjoy it.... However, I had just eaten about 2 lbs of gorgonzola-covered fries, so that may be why. For my milkshake, I ordered my go-to -- Salted Nutella Crunch with Chocolate Vodka. As always, it was absolutely delicious.

The most impressive part about my experience was the service. The waitress was initially intimidating with a short, \"aggressive\" haircut and covered with tattoos. Looking at her, I thought she would be one of those people you would timidly ask for a refill of water, hoping she wouldn't bite your head off. However, her personality couldn't be any more different than her look. She was one of the best waitresses that I've ever had. We had three small children in our large party, and she catered to their needs exceptionally well. She delivered their meals early, just so they wouldn't be hungry. Their mom would normally order a milkshake and split it herself. However, she brought their milkshakes in little plastic cups, each one decorated on top. I could go on and on. She just made the experience very comfortable for the parents of these children.

I hope when I come back that she is my waitress again! If I could remember her name, I would give her credit in this review. She made our dining experience truly 5 stars."}
{"text":"Burgatory (greater than) BRGR (greater than)  Tessaros. 

Yelp won't let me use the 'greater than' symbol. You get the picture. Seeing that I don't eat meat patties, ya'll can take that equation with a grain of salt based on strictly either pescatarian or veggie burger selections. 

Burgatory was hands-down-in the top 3 of all-time-deliciousist veggie burgers ever. I did the \"Custom Creation\" with the sweet onion crust and it was a perfect, crunchy exterior and well-blended (not goopy or mushy) composition. The whole wheat bun was pretty fantastic too. I typically remove half of my bun (the top part, for those of you curious). This is due to the \"Bun to Meat Ratio Dilemma\". 

Truth Bomb: Inner fat kid could eat the truffled shallot aioli on anything 

We tried (clean plate clubbed) the Six-Napkin Nachos to start. The chicken chili on top was pretty awesome. They do the chicken chili by the cup/bowl, which I can imagine would be perfect on a cold winter day. 

Good selection of drafts/bottled brews. I had a refreshing glass of sangria. They change the ingredients on the sangria pretty regularly too. If it wasn't in such a weird location, it would be a good spot for just drinks.  

Why no 5-star? The fries were not very impressive. It does take an hour even on weeknights to get a table (even though it doesn't appear crowded, because they text you when your table is ready and people just leave - which seems detrimental to the bar business). And they put 5 of us clearly at a table for 4. Eeking a 5 star outta me would require a little more menu exploration; one of those milkshakes is likely the tipping point."}
{"text":"Really good burgers. Great burger options! This place stays crowded, so expect a wait. Gourmet burgers are trendy right now, so Burgatory fits the bill."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner the other night. The service was good. I ordered my hamburger well done but when I started eating it I noticed it was slightly pink in the middle. It was no big deal so I just ate it that way. Burgatory is nice but pricey so I won't come here as often as I do Eat N Park."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try because of all the great reviews. This place was a great find. Had to take a road trip 2 hours away and used Yelp to find out what was in the same area as the Trader Joes that we decided to stop at. 
   Glad we decided to give this place a try. I had a Buffaloed bison burger and loved every bite. This is a nice little burger place in the McCandless crossing shopping plaza that's filled with a lot of options for dining. The menu is filled with a lot of different burger options and Bison was my main reason for going. 
  The burger was seasoned perfectly and the fries were crispy and deliciously seasoned. If I decide to travel through this area again I will definitely stop back."}
{"text":"We come to Pittsburgh to visit family and friends. . . wait wait wait. . . we come to Pittsburgh to go to Burgatory. . . family and friends are the reason we say we are coming to Pittsburgh.  It's our absolute favorite burger joint, and the fact that they have The Impossible Burger, that is just a added bonus. Last summer, my wife and I did a vegetarian summer, I'm glad that's over. However, on this particular visit, my wife ordered the Impossible Burger, which was way better than expected. It tasted great, just doesn't have the same consistency of a regular burger. I did a customizable burger, which included Wagyu beef, grilled pineapples, habanero bbq sauce, cajun dusting, smoked gouda and spinach on multi grain bun. The burgers never disappoint. They always seem to be cooked to perfection, no matter which one you visit. We also got milkshakes on this trip, and boy oh boy, was it something else.  Again, never disappointed with their milkshakes, we ordered a carmel pretzel shake for me and my wife to share, a little sweet, a little salty, lots of flavor. I highly recommend Burgatory, wish we had one in Cincinnati, although 9 Giant Brewing, is REALLY good. . . they just cook one type of burger. . . which is awesome."}
{"text":"Although I love the burgers at this place, the hostesses were just plain.....stoopid. I would think management would want to hire intelligent individuals that could speak English and would do more than as: Can I help you?"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and fast service!  I went here on New Year's Day and we had the two nephews with us all.  So we all know how dining with kids is.  They greeted us and got our food to us pretty fast.  I created my own burger and it reminded me of The Counter in Los Angeles! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Clearly a place with several hundred glowing reviews doesn't need another thumbs-upskie from me, but I'm going to give it one anyway.

I adore Burgatory. And it's weird that I would love a place called Burgatory, because I don't really eat any meat except for chicken. But the beauty of Burgatory is that they don't just cater to the traditional beef burger eaters. Their handy build-your-own option gives chicken and veggie lovers like me the ultimate burger freedom! Hooray!  My favorite combination as of late is a burger made with chicken breast dusted in cajun seasoning, topped with farmhouse cheddar, BBQ sauce, and onion straws. That's it. Very simple, yet so, so, so, so, so yummy. The ingredients that they use are so high-quality and fresh that you can really TASTE them. The farmhouse cheddar is perfectly sharp and tangy, the spice from the cajun coating on my chicken really pops, the BBQ is sweet and smokey, and the onion straws add a nice salty and crunchy bite. All of these flavors manage to simultaneously stand on their own while working in perfect harmony together. It's truly chicken sandwich bliss.

Of course, you can't have a helluva burger without balancing it out with a heavenly shake. And their shakes live up to their heavenly moniker. My favorite is the S'mores, with chocolate, micro-marshmallows, and tiny bits of crushed graham cracker throughout, topped with a giant toasted marshmallow. The salted nutella crunch shake is also amazing (though really, have you ever had anything with nutella that WASN'T amazing?!), and I love their specialty shakes too. Around Easter time they had a Peeps shake that was out of this world. Their shakes are huge and easily enough to put anyone into a diabetic coma, so split one with a friend (sharing is caring, after all).

The only thing I don't like about this place is their high-top table chairs. I know they're trying to go with the ultra-modern decor, but those high-top metal chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable. I'm a tall drink of water, and I just don't fit right on them...my legs dangle and there's no comfortable place to rest them. I just end up feeling like an overgrown toddler when I'm sitting on those chairs, I don't know why. It's quite odd.

This place does get really, really crowded, and not just during normal weekend dinner hours, but sometimes at completely random times as well (there was once a wait at 2:00 on a Tuesday, WTH?)  However, their wicked wait times have gotten a lot more manageable with the No Wait app. Click a place in line in the app, and they text you when your table is almost ready so you can start heading over. Unbelievably convenient, especially for me since I live within walking distance of this place. Now I can wait at home and just walk over when my table is ready instead of having to putter around outside the restaurant with a huge crowd. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"can I just say, WOW?  I have to admit they lost a star for the shakes.  Maybe I'm a purist, but they were too much.  Flavor was excellent, but huge chunks of pretzel/candy bar made them more of a meal than a shake.  I understand the craze over them, but it just wasn't our style.  Even my kids didn't like theirs.  
That's where the criticism ends.
The burgers, oh, the burgers.  We all opted for the build you own.  You get a notepad and just check off what you want.   Mine was pepper crusted aged waygu on whole wheat with farmhouse cheddar, applewood smoked bacon, house sauce, romaine, tomato, pickle, and avacado.  It was cooked rare (yes, rare), and was MELT IN MY MOUTH GOOD.  My husband had a concoction involving mushrooms, greuyre cheese, and some other stuff.  It was also to die for.  The kids got the hormone free beef with cheese and bacon, and my daughter got guacamole on hers as well.  They both BEGGED us to go back again next time we're in the Burgh.   
Looks like we've got a new favorite!
Oh, and the chips are amazing - we also got the herbed fries which were wonderful."}
{"text":"A couple friends and I went for lunch on a Saturday. Our server was attentive and pleasant and didn't rush us. 
I had the \"psychedelic shroom\" with garlic mayo and red bell peppers (I omitted the cheese)...perfectly cooked and delicious!My friends loved their burgers too. One also had the 'shroom and the other had the custom built burger.
I will definitely be back and I'm bringing my husband."}
{"text":"We arrived for happy hour to enjoy the appetizer and drink specials. The drinks were good and we found some good food options. Our waitress gave us good service. 

I ordered the nachos as an appetizer but the thing was so big it was enough for a meal. It was tasty and if I returned I would order it again. 

The vegan meal options is limited to a veggie burger if you order it without cheese. I ordered the It wasn't as tasty as I wished and it fell apart easily. It was very difficult to eat. I would not order it again.

Burgatory has milk shakes...you should get one. I was able to make mine vegan. I took it to go. You can also make it an alcoholic beverage however note that you cannot take it to go."}
{"text":"Ok, friend recommend this place and we were going to a concert in Pitt so we decided to give it a go. Our hotel in murraysville was a few minutes drive so I had to try. We went at 3:30 on a Saturday thinking we would beat the rush of the dinner crowd, but no luck it was jam packed (that's an awesome sign). A quick ten minute wait and we had a table. Their menu consists of appetizers which we got the habanero wings and loved. It also has salads, burgers and other items but we chose to build our own burger. I created a masterpiece of a hamburger that came out quick and was absolutely amazing!! So flavorful and the meat was cooked perfectly. Their burger is antibiotic free grass fed and hey also have elk and bison and veggie for the non meat person. Best burger I've ever had. And don't get me started on the milkshakes. Just try one and you won't be disappointed. Salted Carmel for sure."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had, by far. Chicken burger is also a solid choice. Milkshakes are the BEST!

Pros: We were seated quickly. Place is clean. You can create your own burger - tons of toppings and options. Chips are yummy but definitely need ranch or something to dip in.

Tip: order your milkshake half way through your meal because they take a little while.

Cons: The music was really loud. Our waiter smelled heavy of smoke, was awkward & barely checked on our table. God forbid we had needed something because he never came back after he dropped off our plates. Charged me for a side of ranch. We ordered one of the burgers with Brie, but when it came it didn't cover the entire burger. If you're going to change $1.50 extra - make it worth it."}
{"text":"Burgatory has all the makings of a slick restaurant chain; build your own burger menu, stylized wall art (a la choose your own adventure journey chart), Buffalo Wild Wings inspired layout, and hipster artisan light bulbs. Like other burger places, heavy on the toppings and the bun is 3 sizes to big...but if you can find the meat, you'll be pleasantly surprised.

We visited Burgatory on a Saturday night at 6pm and ended up waiting 2 hours (literally), and our expectations were a little high.

I chose a burger off the menu while my boyfriend built his own so we could have a mix of things to try. I really wanted my meal to live up to expectations (and maybe my expectations were too high, coming from having many made-to-order burger joints to choose from in NYC).

Overall the quality is very good, but it just seems like everyone is enamored by the toppings; however the overall burger just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"By far the best burger spot I have been to! And trust me I've tried a lot of burger places! This place has apparently got it down pact! Start off with the atmosphere - def wasn't wht I had in mind atmosphere wise.. But was def a fun and lively! They have a good amount of beer on tap! On to the burger: I created my own ...so I had the hormone free beef on their generic house bun... Romaine Lett, tomatoes chipotle style sauce and a peppercorn rub.. Cooked well! Absolutely perfect from start to finish..."}
{"text":"I came back here again for lunch, as had really enjoyed my first outing. But this time mixed it up, and created my own Burger, using the crab as a base and then also got the Burnt Almond Shake (non-alcoholic version). I also substituted coleslaw for the fresh chips - I will not do this again, as found the coleslaw to be bitter to my palate. 

Also when the Shake arrived, I didn't notice it a first but there was a fly in my to-go cup. However the sever switched it out when I pointed it to her - the one weird thing is she didnt say she'd comp it until I asked her and then the Mgr okayed it. So happy about that but still think server should have taken the initiative and offered rather than me asking. 

Other than these two things, my burger was delightful! I used complimentary things like Cheddar cheese, Arugula, Sweet Onion Rub, Herbed Focaccia and Horseradish Cream to dress the Crab Burger and these taste combinations totally delivered! 

Very glad came back!"}
{"text":"My trip to Burgatory got off on a bad start because we were given a 45-60 minutes wait for a table on a Monday night. And once you're way out in Timbuktu (the Water Works), it's not like you're going to change your mind and hop back in the car, so we wandered the soulless shopping plaza for at least 45 minutes before being given a table. 

I understand a wait on a Friday or Saturday night, but on a Monday night? This place is clearly too popular for its own good. And needless to say, my stomach was growling with sky-high expectations by the time we sat down. 

I love that the restaurant attempts to simplify the meat-ordering by asking you what color you want your meat to be (red, pink, slightly pink). But when I ask for pink, and I get brown, it's a lot worse than a misunderstanding of what \"medium-rare\" means. And that's my biggest gripe. Everyone at the table asked for different colors, and we all wound up with the same blah brown.  

Aside from the actual burger cooked level, the shakes were lovely, the beer selection varied, and the toppings were outstanding. But if you claim to be a burger place, you have to do your burgers right. If I end up back there, I'll insist on \"RED\" but I won't go out of my way to wander around the Water Works aimlessly for another hour of my life when Tessaro's and Winghart's are closer and better."}
{"text":"Love that they give their wireless password out to customers now. One of so few options (maybe the only one?) in Murrysville where you can eat & work online if you need to. Their quinoa salad was delicious & the draft list and is pretty solid."}
{"text":"Gluten free buns!!!! 
It can be difficult to find a decent burger place which offers GF.  They have a special GF menu and take the allergy issues seriously.  Their menus are clearly marked. 

You can order a pre designed burger or design your own.  Sides are great too. 
I had the fiddy fiddy meat which is beef and bacon.  It was SOOO GOOD!!  

Go here. You'll love it."}
{"text":"Terrible service, overpriced food, manager would rather argue than fix the problem, and there is no such thing as hormone free beef. I wouldn't go back if it was the last place on earth serving food."}
{"text":"An unusual spin on a burger joint. Elk burger was the highlight for me. Shakes are out of this world."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing place. The beer variety was excellent and the food was spectacular. And prices were very fair. And let's talk about those famous milkshakes, they really hit the spot. I'd recommend to anyone. Even vegans, there's a burger for you!"}
{"text":"Love the vegan options! Service is awesome. Wish a location would open in Cranberry/Seven Fields!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had!  I built my own with the Fiddy-Fiddy patty (half beef and half bacon), gouda cheese, diablo rub, caramelized onions, romaine, sliced tomato, pickles, and garlic mayo.  It was excellent.  Didn't have the best service there but the burger made up for it."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING 10/10! Staff is nice and food is nicer, the no wait app helps too. Only waited like 20 mins tops"}
{"text":"Honestly just go here . I'm just going to suggest elk meat. This place is so good that I can't write a review . Just go here. End of story."}
{"text":"Summary: Upscale Burgers, Fun Atmosphere. Let's go somewhere else.

This review applies to several Burgatory locations, not just this one.

The Goods:
- Tasty burgers. Create your own!
- Booze in the milkshakes.
- Friendly, casual service staff.
- Fun, casual atmosphere. 
- TVs not in the dining area, but near the bar. So take your dose of distraction there.
- My beer-loving friends like the choices.

The Bads:
- Burgers are too salty - every one I've had (and I am a salt lover). But if you tell them not to season the patty, it's tolerable (at least the one where I asked for that).
- The potato-based sides are too salty. The sweet and russet potato chips are a nice touch, but got old fast. The fries: meh.
- A bit pricy, even for an upscale burger joint.

The Uglies:
- I've never been in a Burgatory without at least an hour wait, even at 2 PM in the afternoon. Not sure it's worth that.

Bottom line: I go if my compadres want to go. But I don't seek it out."}
{"text":"How in the \"hell\" is the shake with the nestle crunch bar and Nutella in it THAT GOOD.

Loving the fact you can get your burger exactly the way you want it. 

I'm telling you, there is a way you can get every option ever on your burger. They had Brie cheese and even arugula, different types of tomatoes, different types of condiments and down to the type of flavoring that would be dusted atop your buns. 

Yum."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! A bit pricey but the quality was excellent. I just moved to this area from Ohio and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Color me impressed! They have a beautiful space at the Pointe in North Fayette/Robinson. Hip decor, as usual. For a first day, the restaurant was busy, but we were seated right away. Our server was amazing--friendly, knew the menu, had recommendations, fixed our one small problem promptly and with an apology, and checked up on us just often enough. 

We started with the bourbon bbq wings. They were tasty, although needed a bit of salt or spice or something. But I'm not complaining. Then I got my burger, a build your own which was definitely up to Burgatory standards. I was worried about consistency over several locations but this was spot on. The happy hour specials are great -- half off drafts, half off apps, and discounted specialty cocktails. 

Great job on the new location...we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everything was great! I'm a big Burgatory fan and this location didn't disappoint. Burger was great, shake was great, service was great. Hopefully this place will break the curse of this corner location across from the theater!"}
{"text":"I wish there were 6 stars! The host was super friendly, got our group of 8 seated within half an hour. Love the text message system for table availability...you can easily wander over to TJ Maxx or Barnes & Noble while you're waiting.

I got my burger with peppercorn crust, bacon, crispy onions, and cheddar on the herbed focaccia and it was PERFECT as usual. I do wish the chips were all sweet potato chips though, they are way better than the regular potato chips! Also tried the new Nutella shake and OMIGOD it was so good. This is definitely a place we take out of town friends when we want to impress them. Keep up the good work, Burgatory."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today, and I was pleasantly surprised! The beef is vegetarian fed and raised without growth hormones (which makes it both healthy & delicious)! Today I created my own with a brioche bun, angel dust rub, aged gruyere cheese, truffled aioli spread, sauteed mushrooms, avocado, romaine, tomatoes, and banana peppers. Fantastic! The side salad was also yummy with high quality mixed greens, a tasty vinaigrette, stewed tomatoes, and shaved parmesean. Win."}
{"text":"I have to begin by saying that the 1.5 hour wait was not amusing. I was crammed at the bar with my friends and my husband. ..and a few creepy men who insisted on inching closer to me.  Ugh! Gross.

Then. .. the hostess was super mean and catty.... talking down to us when we asked how much longer the wait was (and not in a mean way). If I am told 20 minute wait and it's now over an hour. ..I think I earned my ask.  

Then the burger.  I like burgers.  My favorite burger joint is Bachi Burger in vegas.  I would wait 1.5 hours there any day.  But sorry friends... never again for the slimy,  drenched grease-covered patty that I was served here.  How can something be so slimy and yet SO DRY?

Now. ..my friends tell me to give it another chance.  I might. ..but not any time soon. I know I am going to be unpopular for this rating, but I stand by it."}
{"text":"Food was good, but service was not that great.  Server was not attentive, need napkins because we got the nachos but couldn't get attention of out server for a while.  The menu said extra napkins would be provided when ordered because of how messy it would get.  Water was empty for a while, and didn't get refilled till I asked the server as well.  I asked a question about what the menu meant by \"chips\" when you ordered the burger but she replied just \"regular chips.\"  In British standards I understood that meant american fries, but I was inquiring about whether it would home made chips or something you would buy at a grocery store.  FYI, it is home made.  If I knew, I would have gotten them instead of the upgrade to french fries."}
{"text":"Delicious! Even though it's a burger restaurant there are lots of non-beef options that are more than a dried out garden burger. The psychedelic 'shroom is amazing and I love the make your own burger option. The milkshakes are ridiculously delicious. The \"toothpick\" for the burger is a pitchfork and they give fortune cookies with cute fortunes. Great theme!
Biggest complaint is the wait is almost always painfully long."}
{"text":"I looooove burgatory! You may wonder why a non-meat eater loves a place called Burgatory - explanation: their milkshakes are to die for! I try a new one every visit. I would list my favorites but honestly they are all soo heavenly. Although a year ago they came out with a plant based burger called the impossible burger that is sooo good. So vegetarians you can now add this to your list as 1 more place to dine at!"}
{"text":"Burgers and milkshakes were awesome.  Go but be ready to wait 30-45 minutes, but you can do shopping in the adjacent stores while you wait."}
{"text":"Gosh, ya know I really wanted to be blown away by these burgers.  Sadly, ever so sadly, I was not.  They were meh, wiggle your hand horizontally in the air, they were that.  Their freakin name is Burgatory for FsSake.  They serve thick burgers, not spectacular burgers, quantity over quality.  The tomatoe slice on my burger was on the mushy tasteless side of meh, the lettuce was right there with it.  The fries were floppy dissappointments in the shape of fries.  

Thank goodness I ordered the shake when I ordered the burger, because otherwise I would not have ordered anything further.  This shake almost made up for the disenchanting burger.  It was huge, tasty and perfect for two people.  Only one of us ate it.  I quaffed that thing down like someone had a gun to my head.  I think I scared my boyfriend a little there."}
{"text":"We went to burgatory after dinner to get a shake with booze in it.  I did like my shake, but I rarely get them because I'm not big into sweets. I probably would return for a burger but I'd pass on the shake next time. It was a large portion and I think it would be nice to have a half size in the menu."}
{"text":"I came here for my 21st birthday. I ordered the red wine (I believe they only have one on the menu), and it wasn't good, almost sour, but of course it is more of a beer place. The good food made up for it! My family and I had a lot of fun filling out the make your own charts. There are so many options and it's a fun experience just creating your burger! My only wish is that next to the rubs and sauces was a description, as we had to ask the waitress several questions about what was in things. The food tasted great- my meat was the grilled chicken, and it was very well charred and tasty!"}
{"text":"It's been I think easily over a year since I've been here & it was just as good as the last time. Sat in the same last spot @ the packed bar actually. The Burger I \"created\" was fantastic! Cooked perfect & did not need any self added bar top condiments. Probably because I loaded it up the way I wanted it! Brews were seasonal & hit the spot(s). The Deviled Egg Potato Salad could have been a bit more tangy/deviled. Service at the bar was perfect. Did not to ask have for anything except...my One complaint...TVs. Viewing choices weren't accommodating...One feed offline & CNN on the other...management tried to fix but gave up too easily, landing on a Bettis profile on Root...US Open tennis would have been great! A bit harsh to hold back a Star? Maybe. It wasn't perfect but overall it was close!"}
{"text":"Mmmsogood as I hummed delicious words under my breath with the first taste of THE MOST DELICIOUS BURGER i have ever eaten (perhaps it was b/c I personally designed it).  

This place is the real deal and a must-go!  They have a little burger form (best form you'll ever fill out) with the biggest variety of sauces/patties/freebies/additions/anything you could ever want.  My perfect burger:
- a brioche bun 
- an angel dust rub on my beef (salt/pepper)
- arugula (they have at least 3 diff spins on typical lettuce-iceberg, arugula, romaine, etc)
- tomato
- bacon
- fried egg
- guacamole
+ crispy homemade potato chips (and bbq flavored too)

This was a very tall glass of burger.  You can also have it different ways as my other friends did - topless ( no bun on top), full monty (no bun at all), or with a salad (healthy!).  The chips were perfect, crispy, warm, and flavorful.

Have never been to this \"wingharts\" place that everyone else seems to rave about but right now I couldn't imagine anything better than Burgatory!"}
{"text":"shake was great.  my wife's salad was fantastic.  my burger was slightly above average.  the fries were tasty.

recommended, but i'll bet there are better gourmet burger joints elsewhere in the city..."}
{"text":"They had a unique collection of burgers to choose from and my burger was done to as ordered. Outdoor seating gave a nice ambience and service was friendly and attentive. I have to say that the best part of this place are the handmade shakes. I'll stop back the next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed in Burgatory.  First, it has a definitely more chain restaurant/bar feel-loud and the wait was pretty long.  My burger was good but not great.  The milkshakes were really the star of the show but overall, the price didn't justify the food.  In contrast, I went to Five Guys the next week.  No bar or loud crowd and the basic burger was just as good.  Better choices in the area."}
{"text":"Good food you can make ur own burger there is sooooooo MUCH to pick from and you get free chips with every"}
{"text":"I had been at doctor's appointments in Oakland all day, was feeling sick and had about a 2 hr drive home so we stopped. Everyone says they have the best burgers, they are good, but I don't think the best. 
The salted caramel Pretzel shake was amazing! We filled out our paper for our burgers, which I thought was nice with so many choices. It wasn't busy, both my husband and I said, NO pink in our burgers. Mine came out, cooked perfect, my husband had a pink burger, he didn't say anything though and ate it. I thought the fries tasted weird and my burger was ok. I've had better burgers, my husband wasn't very impressed either. Our server didn't really check on us either. Maybe it was an off day."}
{"text":"2.5 hour wait for a burger is ridiculous. The owners own uncle SAMs next door by now they should have fugues out they aren't getting over flow they should figure out away to use part of uncle dams for burgatory on weekend nights to increase table capacity and finally have the landlord give them permanent outdoor dining. JJ gumberg is too cheap to permanently make their outdoor dining area permanent.  If they left this space JJ could never replace them!!!  Although the food is good a 2 hour wait is obscene I have found many replacements"}
{"text":"I've always sat at the bar at this location because unlike the original, there really isn't anywhere fun to pass the wait. It depends on when you go but I always end up here during busy times with a45-60 minute wait which isn't as bad as the original but this location has more seats too.  So long story short, I just go to the bar. It's first come first serve, they have a pretty decent craft beer selection and I like to banter with the bartenders.  There are TVs at the bar and it is centrally located.

I've had several specialty burgers like alligator and duck but typically build my own with either Wagyu or Bison.  I love the Diablo rub, onion straws and horseradish cheddar. Those typically find their way onto my burger but I'm always switching it up. My advice is don't overload it because then you miss out on flavors. 4-5 toppings aside from your cheese and rub is probably good.  The fries can be hit or miss sometimes but I typically get a side of Sriracha Romulade to dip them in. The Chips that come free with the burger are excellent!  The Jalapeño Cornbread is a must try! Just make sure they warm the butter for you.  I normally get a shake to go (I can't eat a burger, fries, cornbread and shake in one sitting...I tried once and was miserable after)and really like the Fluffer Nutter Butter. You can always ask what their special is. I've had a few hard shakes and like Gran-Dad's Secret.

I was disappointed my last visit to find that they got rid of banana ketchup and Bangkok Steak Fries. They were both 2 of my favorites but didn't see them on the menu anymore. A waitress at another location suggest I try the honey habanero sauce instead and it was good.

I've never had a bad experience here. The staff is very friendly and talkative. They always seem to be up for a good time and interact with patrons.  The food has always been consistent. I prefer the original only because of sentimental value.

This place isn't cheap if you go all out.  You might have to wait a decent amount of time for a seat. If either of these two things turns you off then save yourself the frustration.  If you want a truly unique experience with gourmet burgers then do yourself a solid and get to a Burgatory right now! It is my #1 place to get a burger these days!"}
{"text":"Wow! Another Burgatory review!!!  This is the closest location to me now and while I have expanded my horizons...Burgatory still gets me in the feels.  Unlike some of the other locations, I hardly ever have a wait here and if I do, it isn't long. If you do have to wait, may I suggest going across the street and checking out Deer Creek Winery. Great way to pass the time!

All the familiar tropes are here for building your burger. I still love the Diablo rub, onion straws and horseradish cheddar. And while those typically find their way onto my burger I'm always switching it up. Point in case, on my last visit I set out to try the Impossible Burger. The supposed non-meat burger that still seems like meat all the way down to having a pink juicy center.  What?  Challenge accepted. My Impossible Burger was topped with White American Cheese, Shredded Iceberg, Tomato, Onion Straws, Dill Pickles & Roasted Garlic Mayo on a Potato Bun (the waiter suggested the Potato Bun...good suggestion!). My advice is don't overload it because then you miss out on flavors. 4-5 toppings aside from your cheese and rub is probably good.  The Chips that come free with the burger are excellent so i stuck with them rather than grabbing fries this time! I also passed on the Jalapeño Cornbread on this visit but it is a must try! Just make sure they warm the butter for you.  

So how was the Impossible Burger?  Well, glad you asked! It was really good!  Did it taste like meat? Not really, but it had it own unique flavor that I really liked. I would not say it tasted like a typical veggie burger at all.  Definitely unique and the toppings all complimented the burger itself. Would I get it again? Maybe...

The Impossible Burger is roughly the price of the Wagyu which I love and more expensive than their Regular Beef or Bison burger. So unless you are specifically wanting this burger or are going a vegetarian diet, I find it hard to justify the cost.  But don't get me wrong, it is very good!

I've never had a bad experience here. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The food has always been consistent and I'm sure you will find something to like here."}
{"text":"First of all, I love Burgatory! I sing their praise every chance I get and make the hour plus trip from Ohio just to get it on a regular basis.  I've been going for years now and have been to the original and majority of the offshoot locations. With that being said, this was my first trip to this location as I was seeing a movie next door. 

We sat at the bar easily but it took 10-15 minutes to get service. We had 2 hours until our movie so figured we had plenty of time. Food came out about 1/2 hour after ordering. Fries were far overdone, the burger was the sloppiest assembled I've ever seen along with the cornbread and butter being cold. It took a few moments to get the waitresses attention but she eventually had a manager warm up the butter and cornbread. Everything just tasted slightly off that night. I couldn't put my finger on it but everyone else in the party agreed. It was a chore to get the attention of the waitress even for a refill and despite having my credit card on the bar top, it took 20 minutes or so to pay the check. Luckily we made our movie but with no time to spare.  Needless to say, this was my worst Burgatory experience. I'm hopeful that it was just an off night."}
{"text":"This is the location where I was introduced to Burgatory a few years ago and I've been back many times.  I've been here for no wait and close to 2 1/2 hour waits.  I was skeptical at first when I heard those wait times but after that first experience I was sold. If you have a wait, go next door to Barnes&Noble to hangout. If you don't like waits, maybe try a different location as this one is pretty small. Or you can try sitting at the bar. It's first come first serve.  They have a pretty decent craft beer selection.

I've had several specialty burgers like alligator and duck but typically build my own with either Wagyu or Bison.  I love the Diablo rub, onion straws and horseradish cheddar.

The waitress suggest I try the honey habanero sauce instead and it was pretty good. But those Bangkok Steak Fries and Thai peanut sauce were to die for!

Most of the time the staff is quick, attentive and friendly but like anywhere, sometimes you get a bad one. I've never had a major problem at this location. Not enough that it ruined my experience and I wanted to complain at least.  It's always been clean and looks well taken care of.

This place isn't cheap if you go all out.  You might have to wait a decent amount of time for a seat. If either of these two things turns you off then save yourself the frustration.  If you want a truly unique experience with gourmet burgers then do yourself a solid and get to a Burgatory right now! It is my #1 place to get a burger these days!"}
{"text":"This is the pinnacle of burger achievement. So many options and they're all awesome. Very entertaining decor and this specific location has a nice open window/garage door thing for nice days. Seriously though... So many beef options, so many sauces, so many buns... I cry tears of joy when I arrive and tears of sadness when it's over. The milkshakes are pretty great too. They serve alcoholic milkshakes but I haven't had them yet. It's a tad pricey but it's probably due to the top-notch ingredients so I wouldn't complain. I've been to Murrysville and the Waterfront locations and the quality is consistent - though waterfront is a cooler space."}
{"text":"Burgatory is one of my happy places. Has been since the first time we went. I had average expectations because of the hype that often puts a restaurant (or anything for that matter) in the predicament of having to live up to such heights, but Burgatory didn't let us - or itself - down! The hype is warranted, and this location is probably my favorite for it's smaller, warm vibe.

Great burgers, and dare I say, even better shakes! The service has typically been really good, and the quality has maintained it's consistency despite their slow, but steady openings of new locations.

I'm not going to dive too deep, as my write-up on the food experience was already noted on my review of their Robinson location (http://www.yelp.com/biz/burgatory-pittsburgh-5?hrid=KHuofFy5VCPpXPv0FbZv4A), and there's little difference, aside from restaurant size (the wait, food, and atmosphere are basically the exact same).

You might enter Burgatory, but your tastebuds won't be staying long...they're just a few sinful bites or sips away from \"heaven.\" Haha. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I wish that I could say Burgatory is overhyped and unworthy of the always-crowded status, but when it comes to the burgers and shakes, it's fully-deserved. We've only been to this location one time, but if I'm comparing this with the original location, I'd give the nod to Robinson. It's simply more open and the bigger bar gives you better odds of getting a seat, which if you've ever tried to eat at Burgatory, you know is the biggest issue.

First, I have to say that the burnt almond torte milkshake is one of my favorite gluttonous treats ever. In fact, the shakes...in particular, THAT shake...has lured me to Burgatory more than the burgers. I'm particularly fond of their heavy whipped cream and the fact that there's actual burnt almond torte blended in. I personally prefer it sans-alcohol, but the adult version is good. I just think it's better without the vodka. They're special shakes are always tempting, too, but aside from the pumpkin pie, which was awesome, I can't stop ordering the burnt almond torte.

As far as burgers go, I've never had a bad one at Burgatory. I've tried their regular blend, the buffalo, and the elk. All three are simply delicious, with my favorite currently being the elk, cooked medium to avoid the lean meat from becoming too tough. I've enjoyed their burgers as-is from the menu, but if you're not into things like bacon jam and caramelized onion, you can always fill out the custom burger form at the table. Frankly, the burgers themselves are actually good enough that the toppings are totally unnecessary, so I think you're safe either way.

The sides are probably the most underwhelming part of the meal. They just don't standout after such good burgers and shakes. The quinoa was definitely not my favorite dish, but the fries are solid. The onion ring are good, but be warned...the appetizer is a huge order.

Overall, if you're looking for a tasty burger, Burgatory is a great option. I still give my vote to Winghart's if you're just looking for a good burger, but Burgatory is a close second. If you're looking for both a great burger AND a delicious shake, Burgatory can't be beat. Regardless of your appetite, though, there's really no restaurant in Pittsburgh that's worth the wait that Burgatory tends to have after 5 PM. We've resorted to using the No Wait app to see the wait time and get our name on if it's reasonable. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Do not eat at the Consol location. I'm pretty sure they're required to burn all burgers to a crisp. Got the Bourbon BBQ burger. Too thick, dry as hell and not enough sauce. Shake was great as always."}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night with a pRr of about 30. Had been on a Hockey tournament weekend trip. Burgatory is delicious. We did have a wait because they are very busy. I don't mind. They had great wine glasses and good beer for my husband. The players sat together and started off with the famous shakes. My son likes it but it's just too much he said once he got 1/2 way into it. But all of the food was so good and it is a very nice atmosphere. Would definitely recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Great, well-rounded menu - I'm not a red meat person, but there are plenty of options here besides the traditional burger! Service is always great, pricing is good for a high-end buger."}
{"text":"Great burgers, shakes, and gluten free buns.  One of my go-to spots.

Would get 5 stars if they had a dedicated fryer -- the only sides I've been able to eat there have been salads."}
{"text":"Monday night kind of busy 
huge selection of Milk shakes
first time in my life tried Elk Burger
was happy very happy)
Bloody Marry with horse radish sounds good"}
{"text":"The Morty's Steakhouse burger is my favorite in Pittsburgh. Great shakes. Great onion rings. Great gorgonzola fries."}
{"text":"When this restaurant first open it was amazing. Excellent food excellent service in a timely fashion. The last few times I've gone there I felt like I was inconveniencing the employees by ordering my meal. I drank at room temperature milkshake, and my burger was wrong. I keep going back because I want it to be as good as it was the first time.maybe I should just find somewhere else."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch with my mom and gram. The veggie burger was wonderful! We all loved our food!
Katie was a super helpful waitress,
We enjoyed her!"}
{"text":"Simply disgusted is what I was upon leaving this location! My hubby and I took my daughter and her friends to the North Shore location for lunch. My daughters friend got wings, we got burgers. Everything tasted great! Service was great! However... each time I take kids out to eat I clean up their spots at the table. I took the paper out of the wing tin and it was RUSTED! Like not a little rusty... full out rust all around the inside. We had already paid our bill. All our waitress said was, \"sorry, have a nice day.\" Like do they not have to clean these things? Out of curiosity I looked in the tin that holds the silverware and it was gross on the bottom. Thank goodness only my napkin touched that or I would have been even more livid. My daughters friend ended up sick this particular night. I am not sure if it was from this tin or not, but odd coincidence to me!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Had the steakhouse burger.  Had it cooked \"red\", i.e. med rare at most.  Huge and amazing.  Also upgraded to the parm fries.  Disappointing but kept me from over eating and feeling like hell afterwords.  Fries were warm at best and tasted like they had sat under lamp too long.  Overall can't wait to go back and try something new.

Time for a nap now!"}
{"text":"I go to Burgatory a lot.  Not just this one, but a lot of them.  They're all pretty similar, but they're not the same.  I gave the original location in Aspinwall a glowing review in 2012, but since then I think the Waterworks location has taken the crown as best Burgatory in the growing empire.

Some things are true of all Burgatories: one of the most comprehensive build-a-burger setups anywhere; creative specials; great options for any craving or diet; and enough variety to never get sick of it (which is good, because I don't really get burgers anywhere else in the county these days).

But this location has that extra edge.  The service is a little more efficient.  The restaurant's a little more comfortable.  The vibe is a little more chill.  Even the accuracy of the orders is higher than at other locations (I've never had a single mistake come out of this kitchen, while I can't say the same for any other location I visit regularly).

I do wish they'd bring back the off-menu-meats in the Saturday Burgers of the Day (now it's more of a Burger of the Week system), but overall I'm happy to see the business expand.  But as it expands, this location is my new go-to Burgatory."}
{"text":"Since it opened, Burgatory has grown from an imaginative and delicious purveyor of patties to an absolutely stellar and complete burger-eating experience.  In fact, it's gotten to the point where this is the only burger joint in all of Allegheny County that I'd even consider going out of my way to visit (which I do quite frequently).

Earlier problems of inconsistent cooking seem to be well in the past, and the entire staff's obvious devotion to superior burgercraft is evident at every turn.  The waitstaff is friendly, helpful, and extremely knowledgeable.  Whether answering questions about the finer points of grilling a burger to specific temperatures or suggesting a milkshake pairing to best match your burger choice of the evening, even the most die-hard burger fanatics (such as myself) can feel that they're in very good hands.  My most recent visit was for my birthday, and our waitress Meredith provided better, friendlier and more enjoyable service than did the entire team at Le Bernardin during my last visit there (the #18 restaurant on the planet could learn a thing or two from Burgatory).

The burgers are likewise a grand achievement, and the stunning number of choices and possible combinations a diner can create makes the consistent quality of every ingredient and every burger preparation all the more impressive.  Burgatory honestly boasts the best array of build-a-burger options I've seen in a lifetime spent eating hundreds upon hundreds of burgers all over the state and country.  The selections of meats, buns, toppings, and sauces comprise an embarrassment of riches for the hungry imagination.  The rubs are especially imaginative, offering a unique way to enhance the flavor profile of any custom-creation.

The Burger of the Day (the B.O.D.) often highlights ingredients not normally on the menu.  Sundays tend to feature brunch burgers, while Saturdays are the day for off-menu meats (Wild Boar, Alligator, Elk...)--but they've been known to run out of the more popular Burgers of the Day, so go for lunch if you have your heart set on a particular patty (I learned that one the hard way a few weeks ago).

Their milkshakes are also worthy of note, but this review is getting long enough--and let's be honest, if you need a milkshake to talk you into visiting a burger place, you're probably not serious enough about your burgers to require Burgatory's special touch, so why don't you eat someplace else and shorten the waits for the rest of us.

It is only my geographic distance from this location, combined with passing concerns about my own longevity, which prevents me from eating here 5 or 6 times per week."}
{"text":"It's fun that you can \"build your own burger\"-- who doesn't love that?! But my veggie burger was super dry. Like was making my mouth smack it was so dry. I've been a couple times and this has been the case. I'm just not willing to shell out good money anymore for a burger that tastes like it's been sitting in the desert for a week."}
{"text":"I have been hooked on Burgatory ever since the first location opened in Fox Chapel. I have never had a bad meal. There are so many options, the pre-made burgers are great but I love that you can customize them with all of their delicious toppings. My fiancé is a big burger lover and this is his favorite place. I'm not normally as into regular cheeseburgers, so I always get the chicken burger. They have a new one on the menu that is called \"Trippin Chicken\" that is so delicious. Also, the truffle Gorgonzola fries are truly amazing. 
The other thing Burgatory is known for are the milkshakes. The portion is very big- I would definitely recommend splitting it with someone. My top favorites are the salted caramel pretzel, Choco taco, and the burnt almond torte. If you follow them on Facebook they update you on the burger of the day, and the special milkshake which changes each weekend. This is definitely my favorite place in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Hailed as the best burger joint in Pittsburgh, I was very underwhelmed. 

I think the best burger places are dive bars so maybe this puts things in perspective.  For the price and the quality there was nothing setting burgatory apart from other specialized burger restaurants. 

We got the Elk burger and wings which were just okay. But I think I should just stick to  my dive bars."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I dined at this Burgatory yesterday and it was phenomenal. I love the \"build your own burger\" concept and they have a wide variety of options.  My friend had never been and had some questions about the burger rubs/sauces, our server Tami was AMAZING and had all the answers to her questions and made some suggestions that were on point. She was super friendly, knowledgeable, and made sure to check in throughout the meal. We devoured our burgers but made sure to save room for a shake...which was the best decision I made all day!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great food, good beer list and within walking distance from stadiums and hotels. Service was very good as well. Would definitely come back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a number of times and have a great experience each and every time! I recommend using the NoWait app so you are not waiting for over an hour for a table. I have usually spent my time at the bar and service has been \"ehh\" but as long as I had a drink if needed and my food-all was good. I always do a custom creation. I have also had the salted nutella crunch shake and it is to die for! My boyfriend has had the meat your maker and said it was awesome! If you want a burger, this is a great choice!"}
{"text":"\"Vegan Tuesday\" ...At Burgatory?! That's right, Yelpers! The famous burger and milkshake joint offered a spicy black bean burger & pineapple coconut shake this past Tuesday. I expect that they will switch up the vegan burger and shake option every week or month. Unfortunately, the black bean burger was not gluten free, womp womp...

Just when I thought I was out of luck, the waitress brought me the gluten free menu. They had gluten free AND vegan options on this special menu! What a delight! I decided to get the naked (no bun...even though they DO offer gluten free buns!) portobello mushroom with an onion dust, tomato, onion, cucumber, avocado, and a Sriracha glaze. Instead of chips, I got the Quinoa salad. There wasn't a description of the Quinoa salad on the menu so I didn't realize it came with feta cheese on top. Not a huge deal, it was easy to take off. The Quinoa salad was quinoa, peppers, onion and spices tossed in a light vinaigrette. Tasty side dish & a plentiful portion size. My favorite part of the meal was by far the onion dust on the portobello mushroom! Slightly crunchy on the outside and the flavor seeped through into the warm, soft middle of the shroom. I will get a dust on my portobello burger every time I'm there! I would have liked a few more avocado slices (a few thin slivers is never enough) and a spicier Sriracha glaze would have given the burger the perfect punch. I understand making the glaze mild for those patrons who have a weak tolerance for spicy food. 

We didn't have any issues with our waitress. She was friendly, attentive and made great suggestions about the food. She was quite good at up-selling, I'll give her that! 

The layout of the restaurant is standard Burgatory and what you'd expect. Clean and spacious- no complaints from our group! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place :D I was really skeptical about the restaurant, but as soon as I walked in I was hooked. The decorations are really witty and the name itself made me smile! (Burger purgatory= Burgatory LOLOL) and the waitresses were really nice. The wait was super long though-- I think an hour and a half. But the food was definitely definitely worth it. Soo good. You can customize a burger exactly how you want it! I'm coming here again!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try Burgatory, and it was good, but not quite as amazing as it should be.

Good quality burger, and ingredients in general, but everything beyond that is kind of gimmicky. Lots of buzzwords and foodie sounding ingredients that don't add much.

I had the When Pigs Fry, which is a fried baby back rib.  Great texture and flavor - so tender, coming right off the bone but the Sriracha glaze is nothing special. 

Had a burger as well, stuck with the beef. Had an egg and a couple other toppings on it. It was great, but once again the fancy BBQ sauce was good, but not great. 

I'll happily go back again, and it's close to being amazing, but just misses what wound take it over the top."}
{"text":"I don't even really like burgers, but I love burgatory. I'm always up for a dinner there. They have so many options! You do have to be careful, because you could potentially build a $20 burger before you even realize it. With all the extra toppings to put on from the list it's hard to stop. Bacon jam? Yes please. 

Since I'm not a huge red meat lover, I do love building a ground chicken burger. They are so good. Also surprisingly enough, their nachos are awesome. They come with chili, quac, and some sort of chipotle cream stuff that's delicious. 

I also enjoy their happy hour specials. Very good deals if you can make it in time. The style of the place is dark and modern and clean. They also have a nice patio to sit on that's right on the street."}
{"text":"I personally love the rosemary buns! The burnt almond torte & fluffed nutter shakes are my favorite !"}
{"text":"I have heard many great reviews from this place, and maybe that was it's downfall.

I arrived right at 5PM, because I heard that it could get very packed.  Didn't leave until a little after 6PM, and there were still tables available on a Wednesday night.

5 is the time to be there however, as it is half off draft and specialty drinks.  Beer selection was good, but not what everyone is blowing it up to be.  

Built my own burger with the Wagu Beef, and the waitress (although cute and kind) was not overly helpfull.  I expected so much more from the beef, but it just didn't deliver.  The burger ended up being underwhelming for the price, and I expected much more.  

I had no room for a milkshake although they looked and sounded delicious.  

All-in-all.... An OK burger at a higher price.  Drinks were good and economical, but only because I hit it at Happy Hour.  This Montana Boy was not overly impressed."}
{"text":"This place is always awesome. This experience was not a good one. Our waitress Sam was either very busy or forgettable.

We asked for napkins, silverware and another beer. Before our food was delivered. We received our food, ate it and she never came back to check on us. She came at the end and said anything else I can help you with. She forgot about our napkins and beer.

Then 10 minutes go by and still hasn't brought me back my credit card. I had to ask the manager. I received it in a short period of time."}
{"text":"We were told there was a really \"famous\" burger place in Pittsburgh that we had to try.  Of course no one could remember the name.  When checking into our hotel I asked and was told to give this place a try. They said the burgers were really good and so were the shakes.  Let's just say if I came back it would only be for the short rib fries!"}
{"text":"Delicious cocktails- the strawberry basil one went down easy and made the walk across the river to light up night painless. ;) We had the morty's steakhouse burger and the elk burger- both were excellent- great set of flavors and so satisfying. Don't overlook the apps either- we tried the fries that come topped with short ribs, gravy, and cheese curds- gourmet poutine for those familiar with the Canadian dish- I'm going to be dreaming about that dish until I can get back to Pittsburgh again. We were so full that we couldn't sample one of the amazing looking shakes but that's definitely on the list to try next time. They also have a great kids menu."}
{"text":"Went to Burgatory (Waterworks) this past weekend and while the reviews are dead on about the food (AMAZING) we were equally impressed with the service.  While everyone seemed friendly and helpful, our server Justin, made our experience so much better.  He was friendly, attentive, and made sure that were happy with our order.  My husband asked him for a recommendation on food and he nailed the elk gone wild burger!  As good as he promised it would be.  He also recommended a killer margarita for me -- delicious!  Ask for Justin when you go!  You won't be disappointed!!  Peace!"}
{"text":"Burgatory is awkwardly (awesomely??) located right in the middle of an outdoor shopping center. The internet informed me that the wait here is ridic on weekends, and when I called at 6:15 I was told there was a 2 hour wait and had to come down in person to put my name in. After some aggressive driving, getting our names in, and shopping at TJ Maxx (next door!!!), 90 minutes passed and I was TXT MSG'd that our table was ready. I replied with a winky robot face ;] but the flirtation was not mutual :'[

Before I go any further, I need to state that Xzibit is to Pimp My Ride as Jason J. is to burgers. Another simile to follow. Allow me to describe the ingredients and reasoning that I believe made the perfect burger off of the Custom Creations menu:

Bison meat: I shouldn't need to explain this, but M Bison was a force to be reckoned with in the Streetfighter games. He would have wanted my burger this way.
Brioche roll: Gotta impress the ladies with my worldliness and shit.
Angel Dust rub: Admittedly, I had no idea what was in it before ordering, and still don't, yet it was critical that it be all up in my bison patty. Angel Dust rub is to happiness as Angel Dust / PCP is to tripping balls. Bam. You've been double similed. 
Horseradish cheddar: I was about to get the whatever cheddar then happened to glance at this wondrous combination of unlikely foodstuffs. History made. No going back.
Truffled shallot aioli: I literally would have hated myself forever if I did not get this.
Fried egg: You know who doesn't get fried eggs on their burgers? Assholes. And vegans. On their vegan burgers. 
Applewood smoked bacon: Standard decision. I need some sort of control ingredient on all my burgers anyways.
Romaine lettuce and pickles: Because sometimes I like my salads on top of my meat.
Blood: If a burger isn't rare / medium rare, we have a problem.

The adorbz girlf inhaled a Meat Your Maker burger (dry aged Wagyu beef with sweet onion crust, aged Gruyere, roasted tomatoes, organic field greens and truffled shallot aioli) and my tastebuddies approved of her selection. We also ordered the truffled Gorgonzola fries which was obviously the best decision regarding fried food selection that evening. Liquid accompaniment was handled by a shake with the namesake Grand-dad's Secret (Old Grand-Dad bourbon (THE KEY TO MY HEART), caramel, ice cream, and whipped cream). Zounds.

Why does this estabilishment not exist in Boston?"}
{"text":"Loved this place but a word of caution if you are not used to the supersized american portions - do NOT order an alcoholic milkshake and then expect to eat any of your burger. Had a buffalo burger which ROCKED.
 I was blown away by the caramel apple maple bacon pancake milkshake.."}
{"text":"Review based on their milkshakes. I crave them!!! I usually get the caramel+pretzel one, which is sweet as well as savory, and also milky as well as crunchy.  It's a little pricey ($6.42 with tax) but it's also hard to finish one alone, so I recommend sharing it between two or even three people!"}
{"text":"A big'o juicy burger that doesn't even fit in my mouth yummmmmmmm.....this place really hit the spot, you either ordered the specialty burgers where the toppings are already choose or you create your own burger....a pretty neat place and quality and variety of toppings was excellent, the atmosphere is more like a sports bar so not really a family joint where you can bring grandma and all for a fancy dinner"}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here every time I come to Pittsburg. Great burgers and if you won't get here often, make sure you get a milkshake! If it were just a tad less pricey, I'd give it 5 stars. But the meals are great!"}
{"text":"Excellent, overall!  Always hard to find a seat, but usually packed.  I had a Bison Burger (pink), peppercorn crusted, with arugula and a fried egg on top -- that was a \"design your own burger\" option (which turned out, tasty, if I may so so myself).  

The cole slaw on the side was good, but not great.  Needed a little more flavor.  The shakes have some wacky combinations, but always good!"}
{"text":"Still on a quest to find a tasty burger in Pittsburgh, my boyfriend and I brought an out-of-town guest to Burgatory on a Friday night.  I knew there would be a wait, since people mention that in all the reviews, but I figured it was one of those things where they say it's a 90 minute wait, but really it's 45 minutes, you know?  Yeah, not so.  They said 75-90 minutes, and I believe it truly was 90.  Wowza.  The place was packed with people waiting.  If it wasn't so cold out, we'd have gone for a walk or something - they have a great text message alert system so they text you when your table is ready.  We just got some beers at the bar - they had Strongbow cider on tap! - and jealously watched everyone else sitting down to eat.

After forever, we got to sit down.  Service moved pretty quickly after that.  We all did the build-your-own burger option, feeling slightly overwhelmed by the decisions.  All their beef is hormone-free, which is nice, so I had no qualms about getting the regular beef burger.  I got a whole wheat bun, cracked peppercorn rub, farmhouse cheddar cheese, roasted garlic mayo, applewood smoked bacon, avocado, arugula, and caramelized onion marmalade on mine.  Also ordered fries instead of the usual potato chips that come with, but since I was so hungry and had consumed 2 beers, I can't say whether there was an extra charge for that or not.  Probably.  But I wasn't paying attention.

I did pay attention when I took my first bite of the burger - wow.  Juicy and flavorful, perfect medium rare, leaps and bounds above any burger we've tried yet in Pittsburgh.  The roasted garlic mayo was great, the avocado was fresh, and the bacon was perfectly crispy.  There was a generous side of small, crispy fries which were the perfect accompaniment.  Everyone loved their meals - I know my cohorts got fried eggs on theirs, which they enjoyed - and we all agreed it was a meal worth the wait.

I'd love to come back here - it reminds me of The Counter in Chicago, another great custom burger joint - but that wait is seriously killer.  If I return, it'll have to be on a day when I'm really in no hurry at all.  90 minutes is a long time to stand around, watching delicious food go past.  But there's a reason this place is so popular - whoever is cooking the burgers and sourcing their ingredients really knows what they are doing."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and shakes. Some odd combinations like the Piggy Butter and Jelly burger, but they seem to work. I love Bison and the Roam
On the Range was excellent.  The kids loved their Cookie Monster shake. We liked it so much we came back two nights later!"}
{"text":"I tried the jerk chicken burger. I was expecting a chicken breast but it was ground chicken. I was really surprised how good it was! It was delicious on a whole wheat bun and grilled pineapple. So if  you want to go there and not in the mood for a burger there are other options. I noticed some other people getting salads that looked good and loaded."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for the perfect Burger, and Burgatory pretty much nails it. The burger patties are always thick, juicy, and cooked to medium rare perfection. I tried the Prime Rib Dinner burger, and no kidding, it tasted like a prime rib dinner on a burger, complete with horseradish and fried onions. It's one of those gimmicky concoctions that shouldn't work, but it really does. Also on par with their burger concoctions are their milkshakes. The place gets really crowded on weekends, but somehow the service is still pretty good."}
{"text":"First time here at Burgatory and I was super excited. I had been dying to check this place out since I moved to Pittsburgh. My husband started out with the s'mores milkshake, being lactose-intolerant, I could not order one for myself, but tried some of his, and it was absolutely delicious. 

For our burgers, we had the Standard Deluxe and the Farmer Brown. Our burgers came out more cooked than we liked, which bothered me, but we were rushing to catch a movie so we didn't send them back. Also, our waitress was not very attentive to our needs once our food arrived. We still enjoyed our meal, and I truly see why this place is so amazing and so well loved by everyone. Can't wait to come back to try their other burgers, and I'm definitely getting the home made chips instead of fries next time, trust me, they are so much better!!!"}
{"text":"The burgers are great! I went there for my birthday and our waitress was super nice to provide me the best milkshake!"}
{"text":"Why is this place awesome? I guess because it makes you want to go to a strip mall. Also, the Morty's truly does taste like you distilled the essence of Morton's into a delicious burger. Is it the best burger in Pittsburgh? Probably not. Damn good though. Extra points for cool decor, good atmosphere and tons of awesome options to build your own burger."}
{"text":"One of the best burger bars I've ever been to. A huge selection of meat and toppings to choose from, you'll definitely be able to find something for everyone, even the vegetarians and gluten-free folks."}
{"text":"By now most of you have probably tried burgatory at one point or another so I won't go into a whole lot of detail for this one. Burgatory is a solid spot if you are looking for a burger. The build your own burger option gives you the option to make it exactly how you want it down to the patty, bun, seasons, sauces, and toppings. 

On top of the awesome burgers they have a pretty solid happy hour. They have some discount appetizers and drinks. I personally LOVE the basil shag. It's so refreshing that it's hard not to have multiple. The nachos are also delicious and that's coming from a major nacho snob. So trust me on this one!"}
{"text":"Definately not all I'd hoped it would be. 

I have been looking forward to this restaurant opening for some time. As a fan of Uncle Sams, I had been keeping my eye on the progress of the location. I finally went last night, and to my suprise, I was very disappointed. 

I ordered the standard burger, thinking it would be hard to mess up something so original. The burger was over cooked and weet (maybe next to a burger that had some sort of spice rub on it?). I liked the white american cheese rather than cheddar, but overall, I was disappointed in the taste and the ability of the chef to cook an adequate burger. 

The dinner partner had a bison burger, which was, to be nice, extremely overcooked. In fact, if you pulled it off the bun, the bun was black from charring and burning. It was so dry it was falling off in pieces when he bit into it. 

I did like the idea of buidling your own burger, which he did, and liked, again, minus the ability of the chef to adequately cook a burger. 

Other problems: had the onion rings, which looked fabulous, but definately undercooked. There was so much batter on them (not bad) that it didn't cook the whole way through. This equals mushy onion rings!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my milkshake and burger.  Even the potato chips were delicious, and I'm not usually a fan of those.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! The ambience, the food, the staff EVERYTHING was absolutely awesome. The only thing that I can say negative is that i wanted my burger well done but they brought it to me pink, they made up for that mistake by bringing me one of the best burgers ever! The drinks were awesome shout out to the cooks and bartender! I would recommend this place 100%."}
{"text":"Lots to eat. Giant burgers with lots of options. I couldnt find the cheese and thought that it needed nore carmelized onions. Took a long time to get my onion rings but the manager comped it because the first ones burnt and my dinner came out with it.  They were huge and very good!   I recommend too as suggested to get milkshakes with the burgers. I got the burnt almond one. It had a little too much whipped cream but was enjoyable.  Place had many empty tables for a weeknight and the popularity. Glad i ordered burger pink and red. Mine was medium rare to rare and red must be raw. 
Based on the reviews I expected the best burger ever. It was large but didnt have the flavor. I couldnt taste the seasoning or the bbq sauce. I would like to try it again. I think the chef had a bad day."}
{"text":"Super good food and excellent beer choices. I got the Meat Your Maker burger and an Erie Brewing Co. Shandy. All I can say about the burger is that it is probably top 3 burgers that I've ever had. It's truly that good. The Shandy was surprisingly good. Reminded me of Leinie's summer shandy with a little less carbonation. Services was great, food was great, and good atmosphere. Everything youd like for a burger joint. 5 stars! Highly recommend if you've never been to a Burgatory."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had!  I love the burger options here and the customization is really nice for me since I like to be adventurous with my burgers.  They have some interesting toppings (like a fried egg, ham) and meats (such as bison).  And a variety of flavored rubs and sauces to go with it as well.  For side dishes, they have more than just the standard fries, such as quinoa.  And the burger is HUGE so you don't really need a side anyway. The beer draft list is very nice and the alcoholic shakes are quite delicious (if you have any room after the burger). This place gets busy so expect a wait, but they have a bar you can have a drink while you wait."}
{"text":"This was our third time at this restaurant and we loved it and had so much fun! Our server was Tami who was attentive, super nice and came to check on us often. 

We checked in online (which I highly recommend, especially with kids!) and only sat down for a good 5 minutes. We were sat close to the door, which was good for an active toddler to look around. 

We ordered the fork it fries with the gravy on the side for an appetizer. It wasn't exactly what we were expecting. It would have been better with fried cheese curds and some nacho cheese or shredded cheese instead of the gravy. 

I made my own burger and my husband ordered the meat your maker burger and the chicken strip meal for the toddler. Once I started to eat my burger I noticed it had some pink in it (I did specify that I wanted no pink, because I'm pregnant). They quickly remade my burger with many apologies and the burger was amazing! 

We each had a shake and an ice cream treat for the toddler for finishing his meal. 

It is a little pricey but the quality of the food and experience are so well worth it!"}
{"text":"Holy crap. Burgatory is amazing. 

The boyfriend and I flew up to Pittsburgh on a whim for the Steelers playoff game. We passed a Burgatory billboard and liked the name. After getting to the hotel, showering off the airport/airplane funk, we headed right over. We got there about 20 minutes before close, and felt bad about getting there so late, but everyone was really great about it.

Our waitress explained everything to us: you can order a burger on the menu, or create your own. We decided to create our own and used the pad and pencils on the table. 

I built a regular beef burger with mushrooms, fried onions, and cheese (also, with two types of pickles on the side). Bf did a buffalo burger with mushrooms, cheese, and other various toppings. The burgers come with chips, but I subbed fries with mine. I also decided to try a side of their baked beans. 

Man on man that food is DELICIOUS. My burger was definitely cooked to \"medium\" like I'd asked, and bf's was appropriately rare (I say ew, he says yum). The fries were good, but the burger was the star of the show. I tried one of the chips and those were really good too. The beans had a good flavor, but were too spicy for my wimpy wimpy mouth. I love the plastic pitchfork picks in the burgers. Not gonna lie: I kept mine. It's awesome. 

Since we got to Burgatory so late, by the time we finished inhaling our amazing burgers, it was after close. We asked our server if shakes were at all possible? We didn't want anyone to have to re-clean anything on our account. She assured us that we were good to go. I was really intrigued by the Coffee and Donuts shake, but wasn't feeling adventurous enough to actually get the donuts in it. They were happy to leave them out for me, giving me an amazing chocolate-coffee shake. AMAZING HOLY CRAP. I'm drooling just thinking about it. There were small bits of coffee beans inside the shake and the shake was so thick. Oh my god. It was a PERFECT milkshake. Boyfriend got a caramel shake (normally it's caramel-pretzel, but he wasn't feeling the pretzel; again, they were happy to oblige) and he was really impressed. So thick, so creamy, so delicious. 

The shake was so good, we came back the next day just to get a milkshake to go.  It was just as excellent on the second time around. Oh man. 


It would be weird to fly from Texas to Pittsburgh for a hamburger and milkshake, right? Because I totally would..."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Service is great. Food is delicious. I got the smores milkshake and buffalo bison burger. Both are amazing! Expect to go home with leftovers (especially the shake)."}
{"text":"I got the crab cake burger and it was delicious.  Kinda wish I got a real burger after seeing everyone else's.  The place was extremely busy for being a weeknight and the waitresses are all dressed to impress.

If you come here you have to get one of their shakes.  I got the caramel pretzel shake.  I was in Pittsburgh for business but it was so good that I called my wife to tell her how delicious it was.  I'm a sucker for that salty-sweet combo."}
{"text":"Very, VERY VERY good burgers.  They also didn't mind that we had our friends' 8-month-old, who was making a bit of a mess of the table.  GREAT servers, amazeballs spiked milkshakes, stupid-good burgers.  Killer.  Didn't have the truffle fries 'cause I loathe truffle oil.  Everything I had was super."}
{"text":"I don't want to say I'm a fan of this place but I did enjoy my first and only experience at Burgatory. I'm also not a big burger fanatic so I'll only give it a 3.8 (not the restaurant's fault at all).

This is a really fun and cool place and I guess a MUST for burger aficionados! I can see a lot of people LOVING this place. The service was awesome. Our server was super knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly too. I made my own burger for the first time which turned out to be a decent burger so that was kinda cool. The shakes though were nothing to rave about. I mean I already had a ginormous burger + appetizers + cocktails so when you add that milkshake to the equation which I did, you bet I was in some serious pain by the end of the meal. I couldn't even walk up straight to the car. It felt like a dinner you give someone in a death row! If you're up for some gluttonous meal, the Burgatory is the perfect place for ya. The name itself says so."}
{"text":"Surprisingly hip, especially since it's part of a strip mall, you usually find places this trendy in tucked away, older neighborhoods of Pittsburgh, It's a little pricy for burgers and shakes, but you're compensated by the atmosphere. I have a feeling that people either love it and are regulars or tend to visit once and find it a little overrated. 

I had no complaints with my burger, except that they forgot to put something that I ordered on my burger (you can custom-order a burger by filling out a paper scorecard in the center of your table) and I was too timid to mention it to my waiter. I would return here, it's also conveniently located by the cinema, with a little walkway that cuts through the strip mall, so if carefully scheduled, dinner here and then a movie would be a good night out."}
{"text":"Came in to meet friends was greeted and seated immediately by smiling staff. The server was very patient with the fact that the other people took a long time to arrive. The food came and everything was perfect and I can confidently say it was the best burger I have ever eaten. Theres a red robin near by but burgatory is the place to go."}
{"text":"As the name implies, the burgers are delicious. I especially like the \"build your own burger\" checklist where you can select from a huge number of meats, rubs, cheeses, sauces, and toppings. If you're looking for it, chances are that it's on the menu.

Their shakes are also delicious. Just beware: both the burgers and shakes are pretty large. Unless you go in hungry it's likely that you'll not finish one of them."}
{"text":"My seat was wet at the booth I was sitting at and no one even bothered to wipe it. It was a slow day too. Needless to say, service needs improvement.

I ordered the cookie monster shake, maybe I should have read the description in more detail, but it was extremely underwhelming. It's regular chocolate chip cookies blended into a shake. The ice cream they used was not very good either. An unsatisfying shake.

Their truffle fries smelled good, was good, and was a pretty big portion. Definitely can share the fries. Lastly, I ordered a peanut butter burger. If you've never had a peanut butter burger before, you need to try it. It may not sound very good, but once you take a bite, your taste buds will thank you. Overall, I was hoping for a more ravishing milk shake, but can't complain because the burger was on point."}
{"text":"Awesome! Great burgers great shake! A real treat. Service was great - very attentive. Even the hosts were super cool. It's our go to spot for a great burger in a cool environment. You won't go home hungry!"}
{"text":"Grabbing a quick bite at the Waterfront isn't easy, but on this day we were lucky.  Arriving at 4:30pm for a \"Linner\", there was no wait at Burgatory (for the first time EVER).  Quickly seated, we decided to indulge in one last gluttenous meal before the New Year.

We opted for a tasty craft beer and a Pratl's Burnt Almond Torte milkshake to share.  MMMmmm that milkshake may have been one of the best things I had in 2014... and it had alcohol in it :)

The guacamole and chips left us feeling \"meh\" since they were just kind of flavorless.

I opted for the Phat Patti's veggie burger since it sounded delightful.  What I got was mush.  My burger just crumbled apart into a pile on my plate.  The even if there flavor was there, it was just a mushy texture that left me wishing I ordered an actual burger.  Normally I'm a big veggie burger fan, but this left me disappointed.

Next time I visit Burgatory, I plan on ordering actual meat and a milkshake... mmm that milkshake :)"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of their other locations and this one does not disappoint.  We went for lunch on  Monday.  As the place is new it was still very crowded.

We were seated promptly.  The server was very nice.  The restaurant itself is smallish so expect a  wait at peak times. The decor is quite clever and has a some funny messages on the wall by the door. 

We always get a different flavor of one of their fries as an appetizer.  This one was the one with the hot peppers. We were not disappointing.  For lunch we each had a burger off the standard list and did not create our own.  They were cooked right with a little pink and I got the wagu beef one and the wife had the barbque one.  Both were good as are the chips they come with.

All in all another home run for the burgatorians.  Really the whole experience from the service, food and decor was spot on."}
{"text":"Stil lthe best burgers in the city.

I don't cheat often but when I do Burgatory is on the list.

The shakes, burgers and fries are all terrible for you but taste SO GOOD. 

I highly recommend this location.  Service has always been fast and efficent."}
{"text":"now I have been to two different Burgatory's, and they are awesome. This place is a staple while in the Pitt area. We split the nutter butter shake which is awesome. And they are big, so likely a good idea to share.

Sub the Fries for the chips, it is worth it. They have rosemary seasoning, and come out nice and hot.

I got the fiddy/fiddy burger with buffalo cheddar. It was awesome. The bacon taste was much better than getting bacon strips on top of a burger.

Great spot, worth checking out."}
{"text":"wow this place rules! one of the better burger joints

we got a few different shakes, and they were all good.  probably a bit much on top of the burger, but it was worth it. 

i went with the elk burger because why not. the food is great, you just have to wait a bit for a table.

yum"}
{"text":"Originally from Pittsburgh, I flew in from my current home of Hawaii on a Saturday. Mom, Dad, and Aunt picked me and my fiance up from the airport around noon and we headed to Burgatory for a much anticipated lunch/reunion/watching of the Penn State game.

Sadly, they don't have the Big 10 Network and we couldn't watch the game! Just 3 hours outside of Happy Valley and no PSU football?! Bars in Honolulu are open at 6 am to accommodate us Nittany Lions and this place doesn't have the right channel?

We had one drink and left, sorry Burgatory."}
{"text":"So apparently the whole gourmet burger and milkshake thing is a NYC fad that's trickled it's way down to Pittsburgh. Though as far as food fads go, I hope Burgatory can manage to stick around after the hype has moved on to artisanal Russian butcher shops or whatever. 

As a vegetarian, I can say that Burgatory has some of the best veggie burgers is Pittsburgh. And since I do eat seafood (which technically makes me a pescatarian) I can also vouch for their crabcake burgers. 

The menu does have a few pre-planned burgers, but you can also build your own with a choice of burgers, buns, spice rubs, cheeses, toppings, and sauces. And considering the size of these burgers, Frankenstein's monster is not an inappropriate analogy. 

And last but far from least are the milkshakes. Each a meal unto itself, and the boozed-up shakes packing a heck of a whallop, these should not be attempted solo without an iron gut and a designated driver. But one sip and you'll be hesitant to share this nearly perfect blend of booze and house-made ice cream.

This is not a diet friendly establishment, but if you're going to cheat on Jenny Craig a bit, Burgatory is the place to do it.

Pro Tip: Spring for the the french fries in place of the normal side of chips. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"So my partner in crime and I are headed to Burgatory, a chain of gourmet burgers that has piqued my interest for some time now. I'd like to say we walked into a hellish scene, but it was much tamer than all that. Clean, large dining area with a polite staff tamer. No one even said 'What the hell are you doing here', or 'What the hell do you want?' I guess you only get that on the damn tour at the Hoover Dam.
     Anyway, we're welcomed as first timers and some of the intricacies are explained. Like there are no imps, and no, the burgers are not charred in the fires of... you ger the picture. We're soon seated in the patio are, pleasantly sealed and heated for winter service. No, it didn't freeze over.
     What did freeze are the tasty flavored shakes. Had the pancakes and bacon shake, it was delicious and filling. I ordered the farmer's burger (eggs and ham to go with pancakes and bacon, and the baked beans side (ENGLISH breakfast!). The burger came out cooked perfectly to order, juicy and thick. Couldn't ask for a better burger out and I didn't even get the Angel dust (it's a seasoning rub!) or the Devil's dust on it. Next time I will be trying a rub.
     The beans were spicy and smokey with good size bits of pork in them. Devilishly tasty! Purgatory is punishment for the wicked, Burgatory is punishment for the... nope, not punishment at all, just a nice place to enjoy a slightly expensive but very good burger.

On a side note, as there are so many options and the burgers so large, I'd like to see them offer a flight of sliders to show off their rubs and meat and topping combinations. This would be a good way for a couple people sharing a happy hour half price cocktail to grab a bite rather than the filling burger that is their standard fare."}
{"text":"Burgatory has become one of those places where I take my friends when they come to Pittsburgh from out of town. Wow. That list is selective and Burgatory made it. Organically. They deserve it. 

My recommendation: Make your own burger. They have a completely customizable burger option where you can choose everything from the meat to the bun (or the lack thereof!) to the cheese to the rub to the toppings you want on it! Also, if you have room in the inn, try a milkshake. They're all good. I mean, you have to get a milkshake, right?

The quality of these burgers is great. It's like BRGR except better and cheaper (I said it). Every once in a while they have gotten my medium, medium-well . . . But no harm.  Burgatory is set on making that burger right. 

Decor inside is awesome. This restaurant was actually ahead of that design curve when they first opened in this location (what a glorious day). I respect them for that. They have this cool garage area where the windows open to the outside. There are also many Tvs lining the walls to watch any game you care to see. It's great for a night out with your lady (or fellow), your friends, or kids. Versatility like that is hard to come by. 

Do your tastebuds a favor and eat a dang good burger from the place made famous preparing what it claims to make best . . . Burgatory."}
{"text":"I won't rehash the ins and outs of the menu, as many other reviewers have done this admirably.  We went for a late lunch (2pm) and the place was nearly empty, i.e. no wait.  Service was good but in all honesty, she didn't have much to do.  I ordered a custom burger, pink center on a brioche with lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo and ketchup.  It was above average but overcooked and not anything special.  The accompanying chips were also overcooked and not particularly tasty.  I really wanted to love the place, but for my money, I'll walk up the street to Murray Ave Grill for an exceptionally juicy, tasty burger that is actually cooked to order."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night during prime dinner time and it was packed.  Families were waiting for tables while singles and doubles were taken to tall two-tops and the bar.  It was noisy enough to make conversation across a small two-top difficult.

We considered the make-your-own burger options but decided to try some signatures first.  We were attracted to the idea of a crab burger but had a difficult time finding make-your-own topping combos that would work.  Their signature had remoulade and coleslaw, which are creamy no-gos for my creamy-aversive other half.

I got the Trippin' Chicken with \"Magic Mushroom Crusted Chicken Burger with Creamy Brie, Crispy Fried Leeks, Wild Mushrooms & Black Truffle Mayo on a Pretzel Bun.\"  I wanted this for the mushrooms, brie, and pretzel buns.  I love pretzel bread and their was wonderful.  I also felt like the strong flavors of brie cheese could work on chicken (whereas they might conflict with beef or crab) and I was right: work well brie + chicken did.  Lotsa mushrooms = lotsa yums.  I was hesitant because the burger did not have lettuce or tomato, my favorite parts of a burger normally, but I was not disappointed: trippin' chicken met the as promised descriptor of \"flavor explosion.\"

My other half got the Phat Patti's Veggie with \"Ground Cremini Mushrooms, Lentils, Cashews & Cracked Wheat mixed with about a million secret ingredients. Topped with Smoked Gouda, Baby Arugula, Tomato & Guacamole on a Local Grains Bun.\"  It was good, decent even, but not great, and no where near as good as the Trippin' Chicken.  Here's the thing: a veggie burger is a hard thing because you take a starchy puck and put it between two slabs of starch.  It often doesn't work, and this one didn't.  The bun would have been fine on a greasy cheeseburger, but was too thick and dense for a more delicate and subtly flavored veggie burger.  The veggie patty itself was unusual in a good way: this might be one to go bunless on.  Or pretzel bun--softer bread might have worked better.  There were some flavor sparks, but, alas, no flavor explosion.

We both kept the housemade chips on our orders,  They are very good for chips!  However, next time we would take the $1.50 up charge to get organic greens after we saw platters of salad accompanying burgers to other tables.  It looked so good!  I actually personally prefer to split up my chips/burgers between meals.  If I'm going to indulge, I'd rather do it one at a time.

We walked across the street from an airport hotel and while the walking is a little dicey, we managed.  The area had cross walks and walk signals but no sidewalks."}
{"text":"Love their bison burger specialty burger. I wish they had some more kids options though - it's sort of slim, BUT, it's otherwise a good place for families (or friends, couples, etc.)"}
{"text":"Decent place for a beer and custom topping burger. They have great shakes as well. If you go during the summer, they have patio seating.

I always get the hormone free beef with a wheat bun and throw and egg on it. Every so often I throw some bacon on it as well. Chips come with it any custom burger, but they have other sides as well, for a slight up charge.

Their shakes are awesome, if you bring the kids have them split one. Just make sure you don't order them a hard shake!"}
{"text":"Burgatory is always a solid choice. The variety of food is great enough that you aren't stuck ordering a burger, but they have so many options solely for burgers that why would you want anything else? The make-your-own-burger process is easy (and dare I say, fun) and their specialty burgers are clever, with the flavors all working well together. And the milkshakes are DELICIOUS! They are happy to make adjustments if you want to customize a little. The cocktails are good too - the strawberry basil shag is my favorite. Don't forget to check social media before you go to learn about the featured shake (this week's was carrot cake) and BOD (burger of the day; it was a breakfast themed burger today). I believe they have some good happy hour specials as well, but you'll have to double-check that."}
{"text":"Always a staple for my boys and I when we are In Pittsburgh. Right by the stadium and close to the rivers. Food is never a let down with the individual burger customizations, nice beer selection and Steel City vibe. Nice place for the boys or a laid back dinner date. The sports are on, the music is calm and the facilities are clean!!"}
{"text":"Comparable to BRGR in my opinion. Our server was very polite and helpful. Our meals seemed a little slow coming out. This was one of the best veggie burgers I have ever had and I highly recommend it. Not a fan of the seasoned fries which I think were heavy on the thyme. Homemade chips good but a little bland. The restaurant seemed clean but was very cold inside. Not sure if it was because we were seated by the door. Bathroom clean and updates but small. Prices average. 

I'm not a huge burger fan but I would suggest this to those that are. Would like to try one of the hard milkshakes next time!"}
{"text":"This was the first burgatory location my wife and I have been to. Our wait was reasonable based on the time of day. It summer so they had all their windows open which was a nice change from most places. We had just got back from the outer banks so I ordered their crab meat burger with spicy Cole slaw. Not expecting anything I was very surprised fantastic burger"}
{"text":"Had an opportunity to stop by Pittsburgh on a recent roadtrip and stop by Burgatory right near Heinz Field!  Clearly, Location, Location, Location!  Location is great and I'm sure on GameDays, this place is busy.  It was fairly subdued when we were there, but that's ok.  Parking wasn't too difficult, but then again, not great.  If you can't find a spot on the street, you'll have to go a few blocks to a lot.  Again, everything cost $$.  

Staff, wait times, etc. were all great.  Seated almost immediately and staff was right there asking what we'd like to drink.  In fact, our waitress refilled our drinks even before we were finished with one.  That's how service is supposed to be!

The burger was good.  No complaints.  Somehow, I would have liked to have some fries on the side instead of \"sweet potato\" chips. But regardless, the chips were good.  Also, got a side of their napa slaw which was pretty tasty, so recommend that as well.

Overall, great place, and would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"[I'd give it a 2 1/2]

Whenever I visit Pittsburgh I make a point of visiting some location of Burgatory for the Bison Burger- haven't been disappointed yet! That being said I'm from DC and I'm not used to restaurants that: 1) don't take call ahead seating 2) have more than an hour long wait for just 2 people. At home, even very popular restaurants only have 50 min waits for groups of 6 or more (I speak from personal experience). And if it's the type of restaurant that would have that kind of wait for just 2 people, you can call ahead, even if it's a limited time in which you could do so- so you can use your wait time to travel and park for example. 

It was not the normal dinner rush  time and the only game a Pittsburgh team was playing at the time was hockey which no-one seemed to be watching, as only 1 tv actually had that game on. [It's also just the beginning of the season so people seem much more occupied with football than hockey at the moment]. Went to one location and decided we could not wait an hour or more, it was an unsure estimate we were given. So we called another location where they told us they couldn't take a call in reservation but we could download an app and get on the list that way- the wait was about 35 min. So we did that. Arrived and checked in. Still had to wait another hour? So why did we download the app? 

The service was good and the food was good! This is the third time and third location I've been to of Burgatory and I very much intend to go again because I really love the food (the virgin espresso love shake is out of this world)! I just really don't know how I'm supposed to brace myself for potentially waiting more than an hour to be seated...They really, really, REALLY need to take call ahead seating."}
{"text":"It was just fair. Burgers were mediocre. Service wasn't great. It was cold in the restaurant and space heaters didn't help.
Selection of beer poor."}
{"text":"Chain BUT I have one right by my house. Great setting with indoor and outdoor seating! Good burgers and different types of meat! Bison, etc. go if you never have!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in later on a Saturday. The wait time was pretty adequate, roughly about 15-20 minutes. During our wait we enjoyed some awesome tasting Sangria's, topped with a caramel and graham cracker rim. For my burger I went for the healthy naked veggie burger, and I'll definitely be ordering that again. Great place for a good burger and a cold brew!"}
{"text":"Everyone knows that Burgatory is delicious. The build your own burger options are plentiful and of great quality. I also love the premade options that are on the menu. Today I ordered the Meat Your Maker with a red center. It was incredibly juicy and everything on the burger paired perfrctly. 

The service has always been just a tad slow whenever I've gone to Burgatory, but once the food shows up it is worth it."}
{"text":"Update!  I thought it was odd last time when the waitress asked if I wanted to take my Monkey Business Milkshake home with me....and then she packed it up to go.  I've never heard of alcohol in a go cup in Pennsylvania!  Oooopppssss....apparently she made a mistake and that was a big no-no.  

What a shame, this time that all that milkshake-y goodness went to waste when we couldn't finish the apple pancake caramel vodka bacon milkshake.  Sigh.  We also noticed a number of less than half-finished milkshakes on other tables.  Hint.  Go for the adult milkshake OR a burger, not both.  Or finish the milkshake-with-a-kick and (legally) take the burger leftovers to go."}
{"text":"I'm in Pittsburgh a lot for work and Burgatory is one of my favorite places to eat. Staff is friendly and attentive, food is consistently good, and the shakes are just amazing. My favorite is the Caramel Pretzel, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge burgatory fan, even though I always feel like I took about 5 years off my life every time I eat there. 

First, I got there at 9 o clock on a friday and the wait time was an hour and a half. That. Is. Crazy. Thankfully, there was a couple seats at the bar. Every time I've tried to stop at this location, there has been ungodly wait times. The one day, it was 3 and 1/2 hours. 

Ordered my milkshake spiked, Carmel pretzel flavor. It took a half hour to come out. The shake itself was delicious. They are HUGE though and I easily filled up on just the shake alone. Our food took an obscene amount of time to come out, I know they were slammed. I ordered a build your own: bison meat-rare, horseradish cheddar cheese, BBQ rub, bacon, onion straws, BBQ sauce on a bun. If I was a 6 foot tall running back for the steelers, I maybe would have been able to finish it. It was room temp coming to the table, the tray was hot though. Sure sign it sat under the heat lamp for a while.

All in all, a little expensive but you get a ton of food. Wait times are insane. Get there on a weekday for lunch or after 10 at night. Food quality is good, pretty delicious."}
{"text":"This review is for takeout only, but I interacted with enough staff that I feel justified in being able to comment on the restaurant overall.  I placed a pickup order via phone about 2 hours in advance to grab on my way to the airport.  The hostess kindly stepped out of the restaurant main area in order to take my order (it was loud and hard to here).  The PB&J milkshake is one of the most delicious flavors I've ever tried.  It has all the goodness of a PB&J sandwich without the mouth stickiness of peanut butter...best thing ever!  I went with one of their house burgers this time and it was flavorful, cooked perfectly, and much better than the elk burger I had had at the other Burgatory location.  I'm still a bit of a skeptic about Burgatory prices, but pleasant service and delicious food make it worth revisiting."}
{"text":"I love that Pittsburgh has so many local burger joints that all boast having the best burgers in the city. However, I was only visiting town for a short trip so I knew I'd only get the chance to try one burger place during my stay. The general consensus on Yelp was that Burgatory was the place to go, so that's where I decided to check out. 

The best thing about my meal at Burgatory was hands-down the milkshake. I ordered the Grand-Dad's Secret which contained Old Grand-Dad bourbon with caramel and vanilla ice cream. This was easily the best alcoholic milk shake I've ever had. Generally, hard shakes try to hide the alcohol from the drinker. That was not the case here. The bourbon was front and center and the ice cream acted as the perfect chaser to the initial strong taste of the whiskey. I'd highly recommend the shake. 

The burger was less impressive. I ordered Morty's Steakhouse burger. While I think the burger did indeed live up to the description of being a \"steak dinner reincarnated as a burger\", the burger itself was pretty dry, especially considering that I requested it to be cooked to medium. On the plus side, the burger was well-seasoned and was nicely complemented by the onions and cheddar cheese. I thought the burger could have used more of the Cabernet sauce to provide some more sweetness and acidity. While the burger was really good, I have my doubts about it truly being the best burger in Pittsburgh. 

For my side, I had the mix of sweet and Russet potato chips. There was nothing really special about these, and I'm not a fan of having chips over fries. 

The service was not that great either. We spent a long time waiting for our burgers, and the restaurant wasn't very crowded. 

Overall, I enjoyed eating at Burgatory but I think I'll try a different burger place next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Never a mistake choosing Burgatory in the North Shore! I'm a tad repetitive but I always byob and get a spiked shake and leave in pure happiness! I highly recommend using the waitlist on yelp so you can get in quicker!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I've ever had. I had the piggy butter and jelly and I would recommend that to anyone. The chips are also really good so no need to substitute for fries. You will LOVE this place, very laid back atmosphere with great food."}
{"text":"The burger was good, the bartender in the cowboy boots was hot. 

I'll be back

For sure"}
{"text":"Pros:  Tim, my server, was pleasant and helped me select my very first burger here.  I ordered the \"Meat Your Maker\" burger -- aged wagyu beef (whatever that is) with gruyere cheese and some roasted  tomatoes.  it was big, juicy, and oh so yummy.  Really a great burger.  

Cons:  What???? I couldn't get cell reception -- 1/2 a bar and no data connection.... What???? I'm dining solo for gawd's sake.... I'm supposed to be checking emails, FB, etc, etc, etc while waiting on my order.  Argghhhh... good thing that burger was so good.  
Oh, and the other con -- I  noticed after I ordered mine medium that servers were asking \"red, pink or no pink\" not \"medium, rare, well done\". Hmmm, my \"medium\" seems to have been translated RED, RED, RED... Ok, I didn't notice unti 3/4 the way thru so seemed pointless to point it out then, especially since if I hadn't noticed, I wouldn't have been worse for wear.  But ooooooh, noticing made the last few bites difficult.... 

Price for a burger, side of cole slaw, and a soda, plus tip was $22.  A little steep for a burger outing."}
{"text":"Either I was just really hungry or this has got to be one of my all-time fav burgers, hands-down! 

I built my own -- pretzel bun, dry-aged wagyu beef, angel dust rub (garlic powder, salt, peppter), Truffled Shallot Aioli sauce, English cucumber, tomato, Aged Gruyere.  Chose pink (vs. no pink or red for cooked options).  This baby was messy but no worries because lots of napkins were provided.  The taste was melt-in-your-mouth juicy salty goodness, every last bite as I was licking my fingers.  Sometimes I've found that fancy-schmanzy burgers leave something to be desired because there is just too much going on, but this one?  Ohhh, man.  It hit every last spot on the inside from the roof of my mouth all the way down to my toes, I think.

For a side, I selected the Napa slaw. I want this recipe.  It's just the right tangy mess to go with my burger.  

Alas, no room left for a milkshake.  Next time!"}
{"text":"My friends insisted we go here, so we checked it out. I must say, it's a hidden gem in the Waterworks strip mall. We were lucky to get seated right away because we went in around 11:45 on a Sunday morning.

First, the entryway decor let's you know they're serious about their restaurant, and once you're inside, you can tell that it's going to be a great experience. The decor is sort of like a barn/pub with its dark wood. During colder weather, they have standalone heaters that shoot flames through a tube, which were blowing my mind. The theme of Purgatory was kept through the menu design, and I liked the succinct but varied options.

Service was great and helpful. Our waiter walked me through the \"create your own burger\" option by explaining different menu items when I had questions. He also was helpful in getting me a plain vanilla milkshake that is not listed on the menu. By the way, the milkshakes here are awesome. I'm glad to pay $6 for one because of the quality and quantity. They topped it off with a large mountain of fresh whipped cream and a Nilla wafer. Anyway, back to the burgers. I had a whole bunch of things thrown onto my burger (sauteed mushrooms, red onion, whole grain mustard, organic greens, etc...), all held together in a brioche bun. The ingredients they use are very good quality (the flavors came through for everything), and the beef patties are generously portioned. Oh, they also get style points because they use organic grass-fed beef as the basic burger option. The accompanying chips are pretty good as well, and I like that they also throw in sweet potato chips into the mix. 

Overall, this is a great place to get your gourmet burger fix. The experience is a good one, and it's worth the slight premium. It's a bit out of the way of normal places I go in Pitts, but it's well worth the short trip out if you want to get away from the normal stuff."}
{"text":"In a world of burger shops, this is is somewhere in the middle. It took an extremely long time to cook, almost 25 minutes and there seemed to be barely a line. 2 stars for effort, but I look forward to them improving there system."}
{"text":"This is a great casual burger & beer place  with friendly service. 

Burgatory is a sit-down place with table service (which surprised me a bit).  They offer a bunch of suggested \"gourmet\" burgers (some of which were kinda odd), plus you can basically build your own.  With a ton of options at every turn (protein, bun, cheese, toppings), you can get pretty much whatever you want.  You can order the burger either rare, medium rare, or well done.  The medium-rare burgers were great, although one of the burgers that we ordered medium rate came out more like well-done, which was on the dry side.  One other minor complaint - you have the option of adding one of a number of \"rubs\" to the burgers, but the options aren't really explained in any way.  I ignored the rubs and the burger came out fine.

Burgers are served, by default, with chips, which is a little bit of a bummer.  Its only$1.50 to upgrade to some very tasty rosemary and sea salt fries.  So . . . do that.  they also offer a ton of drinks, including alcoholic milkshakes.  They aren't my thing, but whatever, there are tons of drink options.  The sangria is a nice, if sweet choice, served with this kind-of-odd graham cracker and honey thing around the rim.  Again, the service was great, the food came out fast, and prices aren't terrible for a high-end fast-casual option. If you want a fairly fast bite to eat before a movie, you could do a lot worse!"}
{"text":"I remember the first time I went to Burgatory in the Waterworks Mall when they first opened.
I was disappointed then just as I am now.

There have been several times in between that were good, but for the most part it's been a miss.

Tonight there were three of us. I myself had a make your own chicken sandwich, and while it was good, the chicken was certainly over cooked. The other chicken sandwich which was ordered as well was also over cooked and dry.

Now, I don't work in a professional kitchen and I never have, but I grill a lot of juicy chicken. pounding the chicken breast thinner will aid in cooking it a bit better instead of leading to over cooking and inconsistency.

The burger which was ordered was very underdone. There is a significant difference between pink, red and no pink. The burger was ordered pink and it was red. Unappetizing. Management made it right by comping the appetizer however.

I'd like to point out several things: It took a very long time for our dinner to arrive. They were not busy. There was no wait to be seated, etc. Our drinks were not refilled consistently and I had to get up and go to the bar to get silverware for the three people in our party. 

There is no consistency with Burgatory. It's either really damn good, or completely disappointing.

I enjoyed the beer I had for what it's worth."}
{"text":"WOAH!!! This is man food.  Feminist stop reading.  This review will be a sexist, meat infested, beer soaked debauchery.  The things my body had to go through after my meal here are too perverse to write for fear of women and children reading this review but oooooh so worth it.

We got here around 6:30 on a Sunday night and were told we had a 30 minute wait so to the bar we went.  My slightly large buddy looked at the menu and said \"Gents, I think we need to slow play this meal\". I didn't understand at the time but I always take a fat man's advice when dining.  When we got to the table we ordered the beer battered onion rings and \"Just Fork It\" to split amongst us 3 to start.  The onion rings are 5 large onion rings that come with a spicy ketchup and a sauce very much like the sauce from the Blooming Onion at Outback.  These were really good despite usually only liking the very thin onion rings.  The 'Just Fork It' is a bunch of french fries topped with pot roast, gravy and cheese curds.  It's like a Gluttapoolza of flavors that only a man could appreciate.  Women should wear a perfume of this stuff.  

After we ate this we sipped our beers and waited for 30-40 before ordering our burgers.  I ordered a Morty's Steakhouse burger.   It's a peppercorn crusted beef patty with horseradish cheddar cheese, onion strings(enough for a seperate side dish), and a Cabernet sauce.  SOOOOOOOO good and huge!  This comes with heated chips but for 1.50 more you can get a different side dish.  I got the pork belly smoked baked beans.  The name was better than the actual flavor but it's just a side dish.  Why worry about Sideshow Bob when you have Krusty the Klown in front of you!?!?.....wait what?  Nevermind, moving right a long. The burger is the star of the meal and the Morty's Burger is as good as any I can remember.


At this point I was damn near in a food coma while the Apps, and burger were having an MMA fight inside the caged octagon that is my belly. BUT, alas we were not done.  We had to have one of their milkshakes.  I got the Nutella Crunch shake.  I remember it having what seemed like an entrie Nestle Crunch bar in there.  Such decadence.  I blacked out after that and remember nothing more."}
{"text":"Love this place, burgers are amazing. I travel for work and whenever I'm in he area I always stop in."}
{"text":"The best burger joint! Came from California for Steelers vs cowboys game. We are defiantly coming back to this place when we come in to town! They have choices for everyone, meat & tree huggers! I highly recommend this spot! Our waiters name was Sam sweet gal, very attentive and fast services."}
{"text":"Burgatory.  Some have crowned it as the best burger in Pittsburgh.

Four months living in Pgh, several visits to other Pgh burger joints, and a recent revisit to Burgatory, I might have to agree with this...at least for now. 

Food (9.0/10) = They have several pre-designed burgers on their menu, but I always opt for the custom creations option.  Here's the recipe for the burger I always create.  I have named this burger \"Noah's Ark 2013\":

\"Noah's Ark 2013\"
1) Meat = \"Natural Bison\" ($11) - juicy, moist meat from an ungulate
2) Bun = Brioche - buttery, fluffy, absorbing any of the juices oozing from the meat, the aioli sauce, and velvety egg yolk
3) Rub = \"Angel Dust\" (salt, pepper, garlic) - I keep some aspects of my burger basic, while others aspects with some jazz
4) Cheese = Aged Gruyere ($1.50) - a cheese with an essence of nuts.
5) Sauce = Truffled shallot aioli - genius; this is a life hack; GG no re 1337
6) Toppings (cost extra $) = Caged-free egg ($1.50), Applewood bacon ($1.50) - why have one animal in between two pieces of brioche, when you can have three?  My brioche is like Noah's ark, and I am like Noah ushering the animals inside it.
7) Other Toppings (no extra cost) = Arugula, cucumber - natural pepper essence of the arugula, with the refreshing crisp of a cucumber.  Here I provide the green grass for my animals to lay on inside my \"ark\"

The burgers come with warm potato chips.  Chips are not my thing.  But does one really come to Burgatory with prime focus on the chips?  

Appetizer menu: Truffled Gorgonzola Pommes Frites = $6.50 = pretty good fries. Definitely taste the truffle flavor.  

Shake: Grand-dad's Secret = $8.00 = bourbon, caramel, vanilla ice cream; thick richness of the caramel and creamy vanilla; bourbon...yea bourbon!

Other: Veggie Burger = Came with a vegetarian friend once.  She said it was the best veggie burger she's had.  Never tried it myself, but maybe this might give those who abstain from animal meat a reason to go to a placed called Burgatory.

Beer: great list of bottled and draft beers.  I would've subtracted one star from this Yelp review of Burgatory, if I couldn't pair my burger with beer.   


Service (9.0/10) = Service has always been great.  Always attentive. 

Ambiance (8.0/10) = cool set-up for everyone.  Booths, tables, tables outside, and a bar with several flat screens.  A place for the family.  A place for the kids.  A place for a close group of friends.  A place for those who want to enjoy an American meal while watching sports.

Overall opinion = So far...yes the best burger in Pgh.  This place is more of a 4.25 star place to me, rather than 5.   It just hasn't blown my mind away, like the other restaurants that have received 5 stars from me.  Maybe it will blow yours away.  Make your judgement.  Judgement day.  Judgement day at Burgatory.  Be like Noah.  Be Noah.  Build \"Noah's Ark 2013.\"  Note, this place is usually crowded and requires patience to get seated.  Not sure if you can make reservations."}
{"text":"When I came home for winter break, I tried this place out with my friends. It was fairly crowded, but because there's a lot of other stores around the place, it went by fairly quickly.

One thing I really liked about this place was the clever signs. \"Blessed be the burgers.\" \"helluva burger + heavenly shakes\". Kind of blasphemous, but funny. There are more signs in the restaurant as well. I also liked the small towers of fire.. it was fairly cold when we went so it was very nice and good at warming you up!

Okay, so I like the inside, but I didn't really like the burger.. I really liked how you can choose everything and make your own burger and what you want in it, but the actual meat itself was only eh. The meat tasted funny.. maybe it had something to do with the all natural + hormone free thing. Oh, it was also HUGE. So hard to eat. Everything spilling out, bun breaking, burger breaking.. it was more like a huge ginormous salad in the end. Filling though.

The milkshakes are really good too! Friends got the caramel pretzel (it actually has pretzels!) and it was pretty good but I found it way too sweet and too thick for my taste.

We got the giant cookie and ice cream for dessert. I found the cookie to be \"eh\", but the ice cream was SO delicious! Home-made ice cream was real good stuff."}
{"text":"I'm just going to come out and say it, I'm not a fan in the least of this place. I've been to several locations, and go way more often than I should but between really \"wanting\" to like it, and friends that do, I keep giving it a shot. 

I really love the idea of the place. A build your own gourmet burger with a large selection of proteins, breads, seasonings, veggies and condiments as well as trendy adult shakes. Unfortunately, both typically fall short. Anyways, in no particular order, the airing of the grievances:

No burger is worth a 90 minute wait. This seems a bigger issue at Fox Chapel or the Waterfront for me. The burger is good, but not worth the wait at all. 

The best sip of their milkshake is the first. Each one thereafter gets a little less good.
Speaking of the milkshakes, what the hell is the \"whipped cream\" on top. It doesn't move or melt. I took a picture....

The buns/bread. You don't think about the bread until it isn't good, and i have never been impressed with the bread here. The last burger i had i took off the ciabatta. It was dry and broke to pieces while I tried to eat. It was such a waste i just left it on the plate. 

The service is about a wash. I've never had bad service per se, but haven't really had exceptional either. Case in point on a recent visit, we had to wait a pretty long time to get back the receipt to sign. It was only after about 15 minutes we were told there was an issue with the credit card processing system. No back up plan, no way to expedite, just a genuine apology and still having to wait. I'm not sure what they could really do here, but at my last visit to a fast food chain, it took five minutes to receive my order and the manager comped the whole thing for what he (not me) deemed and unacceptable wait."}
{"text":"Best burger joint in Pittsburgh.  I highly recommend you come in and build your own burger for the best experience. The amount of options of meat alone will make your mouth water. From aged beef to Elk. Also, the baked beans are fantastic. They have a little kick to them and the serving is hearty. This place is a sure thing as far as adding to your bucket list of good eats while in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Ridiculous good!  I never thought a hard milkshake could be done so well, but the espresso milkshake was beyond wonderful.  The burger choices are too many, but the quality of the food ensures that I will be back to try more varieties.

The staff was great too!  Worth the trip no matter the distance you have travel."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about Burgatory.  I have been to the one in Robinson a few times and the burgers were good but nothing special.  I can honestly say the one I had last night in the North Shore was hands down the best I have ever had.  I went with the custom option and chose topless beef with the mushroom rub, smoked gouda, bacon jam, caramelized onions, fried egg, field greens and truffle shallot aioli.  I wanted to kick something.  It was that good.  Someone needs to high five that chef."}
{"text":"Short update here - my wife and I tried the crabshack and buffalo burgers this afternoon and they were every bit as delicious as the descriptions made them sound. Wait staff were friendly as always, and we greatly enjoyed the experience once again! 

Will always be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh. I love my burgers and this place lets you design your own. I love how fresh the food is. It's vegan/vegetarian friendly as well. You pick your meat patty then go from there. I like how they offer different options such as bison, elk, crab, and chicken burger. The one thing I wish they had was sweet potato fries. If you are still hungry after they have delicious shakes. I had all of them my favorite is the fluffer nutter!! You can also choose between chips, fries, corn bread, beans and a salad. I like the salad because it's very big and generous. I love to make my own meal!"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch before a Pirates game. The place was hoping but service was still excellent and the food was delivered hot. I enjoyed the Hot Chick! The rosemary, sea salt fried were also tasty. A generous servicing was presented in a cute tin pail. Definitely a great option for dining on the North Shore area!"}
{"text":"Warning - NoWait will give you inaccurate information. We had a party of 6 and the app said to anticipate 5-15 minutes. Upon arrival the hostess informed us it would be at least 45 minutes. Apparently their algorithm does not account for large parties. Known customer service problem that they have not addressed. So if you have a 10 month old and a 4 year old you may want to go somewhere that takes traditional reservations. Love the food. Don't like standing for 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Best gourmet burger in Pittsburgh. You'll pay a little extra but the options are endless and the 'menu' burgers aren't bad options even though I prefer build your own. Red velvet specialty shake is awesome but not offered everyday. Apple pancakes and bacon shake is always a good 2nd choice."}
{"text":"Pricey but incredibly good. Small selection but it doesn't matter. They have a ginger+grape soda drink which is the best, an upscale version of Ginger Ale + Welch's Grape Juice combo I grew up on."}
{"text":"Top notch Burgers in a full serve restaurant setting. It's a burger joint, so it's all about the burgers and this place delivers. I had a create your own and it was superb. All fresh and tasty ingredients and not overcooked."}
{"text":"Burgatory should be on your list of places you must eat-especially if you like burgers!  Be prepared for a long wait if you come for dinner or on the weekends. 
While they have a menu, I suggest creating your own burger. I had a burger with Gargonzola Cheese and Caberbnet sauce. It is the best burger I've ever had!  My niece had Burbon BBQ sauce with Poblano Peppers and lived hers as well. 
Of course you can't leave unless you have a shake or take one with you. I had the Nutella Shake and my niece had the Caramel Pretzel shake. This may not be an icecream joint but their shakes are the best I've ever had. They even have \"adult\" shakes that include liquor. 
The servers are wonderful. The whole vibe if the place is upbeat."}
{"text":"I have been to Burgatory before but not at this location. I met up with a family who had never been. They were super intrigued. We ordered onion rings as an appetizer. They arrived hot and crispy. They were huge!  They came with 2 dipping sauces-a spicy ketchup and a horseradish dip. Both were tasty and everyone loved both sauces. 
I chose to make my own burger so I grabbed one of the pads of order forms and started checking off my choices. I will say that Burgatory used to have a sauce that I loved but they changed up their menu and the sauce didn't get chosen to stay. I love it though that you get to choose how your burger is served. I choose to go Naked-no bun. Their brioche bun is good but to change things up I go naked. I ordered bacon and it was cooked perfectly. The garlic aioli was wonderful. I also had cheddar cheese, romaine lettuce, and dill pickles. It was all very tasty. I picked the house chips which are made fresh. I like to order a side of house sauce to dip my chips in. It looks like Russian dressing but tastes way better. It was a great meal and I enjoyed watching my friends make their choices and then try them. We made one mistake though . . . We didn't leave room for a milkshake. Make sure you do!"}
{"text":"Headed there around 5 on a Friday...glad we went early, as by 5:30, there wasn't a table to be had!  It was happy hour, so I enjoyed the house margarita (yum) but my husband went straight for the apple pancakes & bacon milkshake (sounds awful but is tasty).  Our waiter didn't tell us apps were half priced, or we probably would have gotten one (we only knew about the drink special because I saw it on yelp).  Probably a good thing though...neither of us were able to finish our dinners anyways :)

I went with the build your own creation (buffalo burger on brioche with buffalo cheddar, buttermilk ranch & some veggies)...my husband went for the meet your maker burger.  Both were delicious...though I didn't love the ranch (I'd probably go for something more interesting).  I subbed my chips for fries (loved 'em)...the chips were decent but I wanted more potato.

Reasonably priced...decent service...if we lived in Pittsburgh, it would be on our regular list :)"}
{"text":"So I went here the other day to give it another go with my sister and mom. I ordered a regular burger cooked medium with the honey habanero sauce on the side I got some basic toppings on my burger. I didn't really like the fries that much they were OK. My burger was delicious though. I also got the peanut butter cookie milkshake it was really good as well. I'm glad I gave this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Great service. Very knowledgeable. The vegan shakes are my favorite, I feel they are the best \"fake\" option around! The options for burgers are really creative, and there is a build your own option if you prefer to custom pick !"}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Burgatory.  I've walked by it lots of times and this is the first time I've stopped in.

I ordered a Greed Burger, without cheese or onions.  It was a good burger.  The bun was soft, which I like.  The burger is made in-house and there was an eight minute wait for the burger to be cooked, which I didn't mind.  The bourbon BBQ sauce was tasty.  The bacon was crisp and the pickles gave it a nice crunch.

I'll be back if I'm in the area and am craving a burger!"}
{"text":"They did a great job preparing my burger. I thought the flavor was a bit plain. if you're looking for a good all-American backyard barbecue kind of burger. I would go here. It's a little more expensive than the regular burger joint but the serving size makes up for it.

I had a milkshake there as well. It's not my cup of tea. But a lot of people I go with do enjoy it."}
{"text":"I have bee there twice and I can tell you these burgers are amazing! The chefs create some of the most amazing combination! Both the Bison and Beef burgers are some of the best in Pittsburgh! The shakes are creative and spectacular! They take me back to a time when Milkshakes was like making a piece of art! :-). Great place!"}
{"text":"Chain custom burgers.  You can get a less expensive burger at local grills but this place is more of a temple to the concept"}
{"text":"Burgatory is hands down my absolute favorite. For years. Like, I come here for my \"family\" birthday.  Weird.  Oddly, I have never actually had a traditional cow burger from here, but their chicken burgers are a thing of beautiful mystery.  I might be getting carried away, but generally, this place is quick, customizable, and always delicious.  I've never once had a bad time here.  Granted half of the wait staff are disgruntled, leftover-angst-filled kids, but your server will be awesome.  The place itself isn't much, but you're not here for the décor.  It's casual and cool, and what's wrong with that?

You're going to want to do the \"create your own\" option with the little notepads in the center of the table.  Cute, right?  Get one of those tiny pencils and pick anything you could ever want.  Personally, I do the chicken on focaccia with truffle aioli, provolone, arugula, and cucumbers, but that's just me (the pickiest one of them all!).  It gets crazy messy, melty, and for once, there is no amount of (Yelp traditional) hyperbole to explain myself. Most of my dinner partners choose the typical burger or get real crazy with some buffalo or elk.  How do they have buffalo?  I hope that the headcount at South Park hasn't gone down.  I also want to note on the truffle fries; they're greasy, smelly, and SO. GOOD.  It has that awesome truffle gorgonzola aspect of \"this smells like feet, and it's delicious\".

Everyone wants to exclaim about the milkshakes immediately (Prantl's almond torte shake! Booze shakes!), and I know they are incredible, but don't toss your little drink menu aside.  The sangria is more or less a new age hooch of different non-explicit ingredients made in house for which I am typically not brave enough.  The gem is the strawberry shag.  Complete with your strawberry slices and basil, this thing is excessively easy to drink.  It's simple, but always a staple.

The location itself is small, and you cannot make reservations; I have to mention the NoWait app though, as sometimes you can be given up to a two and a half hour wait (I've seen it!). I know it sounds chintzy to get dinner in a strip mall, but this is still my favorite location.  Original is always the best, unless you're creating a burger that is going to be better than anything you can order off any menu."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger in Pittsburgh in terms of all-around atmosphere, taste, variety, and inventiveness.


Fries could use a litte more crispness, but its my only gripe, and thats nitpicking."}
{"text":"This place has some good quality burger meat! 

I love the ambiance and decor at Burgatory. It's a chill, laid back spot for burgers and milkshakes. The service was great and our server explained the menu to us as it was our first time there. 

I ordered the Meat Your Maker burger. It has a wagyu patty and that's all you need to know. =P Burger has great flavor and I loved all of the other toppings in the burger as well. I ordered the truffle Gorgonzola fries and I am glad I did. I honestly liked those fries better than the chips that come with the burger. The only con I have about this burger place is I would prefer a toasted bun. The bun was too soft for my liking. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Seriously- they make burgers- it shouldn't take over 30 minuets to get served..... something is very wrong and this visit wasn't a fluke- it's always this slow..... get it together!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for spiked milk shakes. I always get the Carmel pretzel shake. It's the perfect mix of salty and sweet. The burgers are great too. I usually get farmer brown burger. It is awesome with the fried egg"}
{"text":"Do not waste one dime on a burger in this place. Over cooked, dry old ground beef patty. If their goal was to serve a cooked hockey puck, they succeeded. I hope that Burgatory is happy that they bastardized their brand, since they will never see my money at their mainstream restaurants."}
{"text":"The Fork it from the Fingers sections was okay. The brisket that topped off the fries was pretty good but over all the fries were cold and the only thing that made them a bit warm was the fact that it had the gravy and the brisket of not I would have thrown the whole things away. Kinda of hyped up place but great section in town."}
{"text":"I'm sure there are similar places where I live in the Chicago area, but this was a great find, courtesy of my wife's uncle.  A lively atmosphere, a lot of groups out for lunch on a Friday, and several families with kids like us.

The food was hot, quickly served and the waitress was very helpful and friendly.  I created my own burger and the burger itself was cooked exactly as I like, and the choices for toppings-condiments, cheeses, rubs/coatings-were varied from the basic to the slightly adventurous.  Homemade chips with the burger were good.

Everyone around us had milk shakes and the options on those were interesting and they all looked good.  Looking at the reviews/photos now, wish I would have tried the six napkin nachos-maybe next time!"}
{"text":"There are so many burger choices, toppings and prep ways that..... if you can't build a burger to fit your tastes then, you do not deserve to eat burgers.  Simply Delicious."}
{"text":"I will ECHO my review of a different Burgatory; this place is beyond delicious. There are so many choices here that,  if you are unable to create a burger to fit the needs of your taste buds, well then..... nothing will be satisfying.  The service is always friendly, the prices are decent, the place is clean and inviting for all.  I will choose Burgatory over any other burger joint.... hands down."}
{"text":"Good burgers. A bit higher priced. Long wait time, but you can \"get in line\" via an app. The milkshakes, alcoholic and not, are good, but not earthshattering.

I wrote a much longer review before, but the website kept rejecting it, so you get my shorter thoughts."}
{"text":"Makenzies Black Cherry Hard Cider was fantastic! Had a custom burger with chips which was also great!"}
{"text":"I had a delicious crab burger that I was able to customize. The crab was soooo good and I had it on a pretzel bread bun. I also had the salted caramel milkshake. I ate so much but finished everything. I will go there again."}
{"text":"Not bad for standard burgers. Better when you custom build one. The chicken salad is actually really good there. What I really dislike about the place is the chairs. They are awfully uncomfortable. Literally, you have to eat and bail because you can't hang out with your friends afterwards. Sitting in these medieval torture devices make me want to think twice about taking out of town guests there. The booths are better. Wait times to be seated can be long."}
{"text":"Great place!  Can't go wrong ordering a Burger your way.  The milk shakes are spectacular!"}
{"text":"Roam on the Range (bison burger with provolone, pancetta, roast pepper, spinach & chimichurri aioli) - excellent!  Truffled fries with Gorgonzola - excellent.  My Manhattan was the smallest Manhattan I've ever been served and in a giant glass. Very odd!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb. They have a lot of burger options (combos). Im vegetarian and they have a couple options that are so delicious to suit my needs. I would suggest checking this place out. It's a cool place."}
{"text":"The menu items are creative. If you want something customized they offer a checklist board of choices. The honey habanero wings were cooked perfectly. Crisp on the outside without being cooked hard or dried out. Juicy plump meat on the inside. Not to mention that the sauce was sweet and slightly spicy...finger licking good. The fries with short rib, cheese curds, gravy...omg it does not matter if you have to do the tread mill for an hour and walk 5 miles! The fries are hand cut. Cheese curds are the perfect size to melt slightly but still have a bit of chewy stringy cheese that you basically twirl your fork around. The short rib meat was tender like butter! Reminiscent of a crock pot slow cooked roast! Our burgers came out perfectly cooked to order! It is tough sometimes to get a burger on point like that! The roll was a perfect match. It held up to that juicy succulent burger! They also offer a small decent craft beer menu, cocktails (made with beer), milk shakes (with or without booze),etc. The service was friendly, helpful, with the right rhythm. Check out their T Shirt offerings too. A portion of the sales goes to a local charity. There are a couple styles and a couple different sayings...all in black. I think that they ought to offer red too...just a suggestion. Anyway both of us were completely satisfied with our experience here and we will return if we travel through the area again."}
{"text":"Good burgers, though a bit busy flavorwise. Definitely don't come with a big group on weekends unless you are willing to wait a while."}
{"text":"I'm glad to see a specialty burger place serve a burger with a side automatically. Some of the other ones I've been to, you have to order fries or chips separately. I want fries with my burger! I just don't feel like I'm getting a good deal if it's not standard.

I had the elk gone wild. It was pretty good, that's it, nothing too special. The toppings would have made it so much better, if there was a good amount of them. The burger itself overtook the sandwich. It was so thick that there wasn't room for much else. I will say that it did have a nice spicy flavor to it. 

My boyfriend had the meat your maker and it was pretty much the same thing. The cheddar bacon fries we had were lacking the two special ingredients. Minimal bacon and cheese, very disappointing. I would give it another try but I'm not running back to Pittsburgh to get it again."}
{"text":"I used to speak very low of Burgatory as when they first opened in the Waterfront I wasn't the biggest fan. I thought it was overpriced for a burger and milkshakes. That being said, we moved recently to the Murrysville area and gave that location a try. Sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive but not over the top about anything which we appreciated. They have 12 rotating beers on draft, a lot of local and a good variety. The burger was great and the bill ended up being a lot cheaper than I anticipated. I will definitely be back and am glad I gave them another chance. Also, my fiancée has the almond torte milkshake and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Late night eating. Waked in at 9:15 at night. Was seated right away where ever we wanted which never happens. Service was awesome. Our waitress was extremely nice. 

I been to a few burgatorys but first in murrysville. I always get a shake. This was a major cheat meal so it's super worth it. I had the weekend special shake they had. Chocolate blowout. The icing taste was the best part. Coffee and donuts is my usual so I switched it up. My man got the salted pretzel and loved it. 

I had the bison burger. Delicious. Especially with the pretzel bun. My man had the elk burger slightly red. He said it was amazing and made perfectly. 

We also had an app of guacamole dip. It was so tasty I could have ordered two and be happy as that of a meal. 

Worth the trip. I was so full when I left but none the less I would go back for another big meal."}
{"text":"First off, Burgatory has excellent service. Our waiter \"Big Creepy\" (according to the check) was very knowledge about menu. He guided us through the menu and was able to thoroughly answer questions I had about the menu. Moreover, he was friendly and attentive which made dining here a great experience.

Now for the heavenly shakes. I shared the Espresso Love and the Burnt Almond Torte; both were excellent! They were rich and creamy; I'd consider sharing one next time because of how filling they are.

Finally, the burgers. I decided to create my own burger and opted for an elk burger on herb focaccia with bayou Cajun dry rub, arugula, tomatoes, and red onions. I had it cooked to 'red' which is comparable to medium rare; I'd say that it was slightly more rare than most restaurants' medium rare which is great for those of us who enjoy juicy burgers!

If you're going shopping at the Waterworks, then plan on coming here for lunch."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short n sweet for you guys. This place has got it going on. The Farmer Brown Burger I had easily competes with my favorite burger joint back in San Antonio. The bread was soft, the beef was seasoned well and made with only top notch all natural good stuff and the maple cured ham adds an extra element of flavor which was unexpected but much appreciated.

The potato chips were pretty good but I know they can do better. Throw some more salt and pepper on those boys and lets call it a day. I read all of my fellow Yelpers talking about the shakes here so I couldn't resist picking up a Fluffer Nutter Butter and its in the running for best milkshake of my life. It is jam packed full of flavor, they actually use cookies to make the shakes legit but the one downside is they need to work on a better consistency so you can actually use a straw without using excessive force.

I got a TO-GO order and it was ready when I got there as expected. They checked me out quickly and the girl who took my order was sweet. If I visit again, I'll be sure to come back and get me a second helping of burger and shake heaven."}
{"text":"Had a great time here today with the fam. We sat in the quasi outdoor space. Too chilly to have the flaps open but warm enough today not to meet the heaters. I had my usual quinoa salad and the rest of my family had more appropriate burgers.  All of it tasted very good, service was excellent, wait time for a table minimal, and the beers good.  It's a good place to enjoy some time with the fam over dinner and indulge a little in the beer and shakes."}
{"text":"The waitress pointed out the two most popular burgers in the menu. I tried one and my wife the other. They just weren't good and mine haunted me all afternoon. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm.....I drool like Homer Simpson thinking about doughnuts when the idea of Burgatory comes up; my second favorite burger joint of all time (Mario's East Side Saloon being the first). I usually like the DIY menu, but they have a house burger called the Farmer Brown (or something close) with ham and an egg on it that I LOVE, so I almost always get that. 
Now, I really like Burgatory, but we usually go to the Water Works location, and the last couple times we have gone to the Water Front location. And I will say, I see a difference and I am partial to the Water Works location. It's not necessarily one thing or the other, just....something. Which is why it's only gets 4 stars; the Water Works location gets 5. 
I ordered the Farmer Brown, pink, and it was perfect. The BF ordered a DIY, pink and his came out much more red. And another person who ordered their burger pink (another DIY) came out with absolutely no pink. Regardless of pinkness, everyone loved their food; the four person in our party had a DIY Chicken burger and liked it very much, but as with burgers there was some inconsistency. Everyone else got a salad or coleslaw, but being the French Fry lover I am, I got fries, which I enjoyed. The girls shared a milkshake and loved it, as always. They have very, very good milkshakes. 
Our waitress was awesome. And all in all, a wonderful time was had by all."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I highly recommend
the elk burger and the coffee and donut shake is perfect to share... And comes with  chunks of donuts in the shake. Don't waste the calories on the chips- nothing special with those, but come on, you came for the burgers."}
{"text":"One of the best Burger restaurants!

I have been there several times though there is always a long wait. The shake and burgers are just brilliant. I love everything I have tried so far."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Delicious burgers, crazy good shakes, and just all around fun."}
{"text":"No wait!  Amazing service and incredible burger!!  I NEVER venture out when it comes to food,  I tend to play it safe (boring) but I decided to try the peanut butter and jelly burger (I forget the actual name) and it did not disappoint!  Oh my gosh, it was so good!  Def one of those burgers you will crave and never be able to duplicate!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't want to create their own burger?? This place is really neat. Aside from the fire alarms going off (they were having issues the day we went), our lunch was great. Our waitress Mandi was very warm and helpful as we made our way through the menu, more specifically the custom creation menu. We settled on 2 very different burgers for the two of us. Mine was a mix of farmhouse cheddar, chimichurri aioli, grilled onions, tomatoes and romaine while my husband went with the Fiddy Fiddy (half beef half bacon patty) with sharp provolone, chili lime ranch, red onion, pickle, lettuce, tomatoes and lettuce.  The burgers come with chips( regular and sweet potato). We wanted to try a shake but I'm glad we passed this time, the burgers were plenty to fill us up. May have to drop in just to try some shakes one afternoon. Military discount was given to my husband. Parking was fine the day we went but I can see it being kind of crazy if you were there during the week."}
{"text":"Good food and even better milkshakes! We sat at the bar because there was a wait. We had full service there and the waitress was awesome. Lay out of the inside was very different. Different things hanging on the walls. Food took a long time to come out. My Burger was not fully cooked."}
{"text":"meat your maker! amazing. truffle fries! amazing. morty's steakhouse - nothing special."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places.  Always great service and I'm a big fan of the build your own burger!  Wish I could give more stars!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, friendly service, and a fair price.  What more can you ask for?  

Make sure you get on the wait list - lines are long, especially on Friday and Saturday night.  

I've not found a better burger in Pittsburgh - if you haven't been here, give it a try!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of burgers. But more than that, I am a huge fan of burgers topped with a perfectly cooked dippy egg. For dinner tonight, I decided to order the Farmhouse Burger - medium rare burger patty with maple ham, a fried egg, lettuce, and mayonnaise. While it was delicious and perfectly cooked, it did seem a little heavy on the condiments. The French fry upgrade was clutch. Overall, great burger. Would highly recommend on a Sunday with football and a hoppy beer."}
{"text":"Best \"made in house\" veg burger I've had. It doesn't crumble apart & doesn't have a pastey texture. It's well seasoned even before you pick a rub to go on  it. I always make a custom burger with the kona crust & topped with all onion things, tomato & avocado.  I do miss the foccacia style bead they had. This was the first time I had my usual without it. No offence to regular buns, but I brioche & wheat just don't do the same thing for me. I'll still come back because the service is generally fast & I love the food. Onion rings are HUGE & the nachos are decent. The fries are fresh cut and nicely seasoned with more than plain old salt. I'm excited to try the IMPOSSIBLE burger soon. I hears from a meat eating friend that it taste ALMOST like a real beef patty."}
{"text":"I've never had such an awful experience at Burgatory. This is the first time that I've been to this location & I 100% will never come back here. Whenever we walked in, we had to say hello to get the girls at the counter to notice us.

 Once were seated & ready to order, the waitress took my order & walked away completely forgetting to take my boyfriend's order & we had to say \"HEY\" do get her to come back. We both ordered Impossible Burgers. My boyfriend had one last week & said it was really good (He's a meat eater). 

 When they were brought out to us, they were cold all the way through so we asked for new ones. The waitress brought them back & said \"They threw them back on the grill\". Why not make fresh ones? We were so hungry that we let it slide and when we started eating the burgers just fell apart completely. We opened our buns to find that they had smashed the crap out of the burgers, pieces broke off & they just piled them on top. It wasn't even the shape of a burger anymore. His burger had hardened food from the grill on it. A complete mess. 

We told the waitress that the burgers weren't right & she said, \"ill get a manager to talk to you about it\". We watched her walk to the manager, talk for 5 minutes, the manager walked to the back & eventually came out. 

 The manager argued that there was nothing wrong with the burgers & that sometimes if they leave them on the grill for too long, the seasoning burns & that's what the grill crud was.... I cook... that was not burnt seasoning. She asked if we'd like new burgers...  FOR THE THIRD TIME?? I DON'T THINK SO. We told her we lost our appetites and she just said, \"ok\" and just walked away from us.

Not a single apology. I've never left a restaraunt without paying until that moment. PLEASE, someone, get that place under control. Burgatory is amazing & this location is doing a great disservice to their business."}
{"text":"This was my second trip to Burgatory, after falling head over heels in love with this place during my first visit. Second trip? I'm still loving Burgatory! 

My friends and I decided to make this place our dinner stop recently. Most of us had been to a Burgatory before, so we had a pretty good idea of what to expect. The four of us were seated immediately. Much to our surprise, It wasn't very busy in the restaurant. We all fully expected it to be packed. 

Once seated we immediately reached for the create-your-own-burger forms. Because what's better than creating your own burger? I really enjoy all the options. For my burger creation, I choose the \"fiddy-fiddy\" burger (half beef, half pork) on a brioche bun, with angel dust rub, topped with farmhouse cheddar, roasted garlic mayo, organic field greens, bread & butter pickles, and slicked red onion. It was super tasty! To be completely honest, I don't think there is such a thing as a 'bad' burger here. My friend created a wild crab burger with diablo dust and he raved about it. I was going to order a shake, but my burger left me so full I couldn't bear to think about consuming anything else. 

So after having a delicious meal, you might be asking yourself, 'so why only a 4 star rating?' Truth be told, I had to give only a 4 star rating because our server wasn't all that great. She checked on us very few times. It seemed as though she was constantly reaching over or in front of one of us. The most awkward part was there was never an excuse me or pardon me. Overall just really awkward. 

Besides the server, it was a delicious dinner! I'm very much looking forward to my next trip to Burgatory."}
{"text":"Two words: Burger Heaven! 

You won't find a place that takes burgers more serious than Burgatory. I came here with three friends on a Saturday afternoon around 2:30. I thought the lunch rush would be over, but it was still quite busy. Luckily though, we were able to get a seat right away. 

Our waitress was very prompt, I must say. As for drinks, try the salted caramel pretzel milkshake or the flutternutter milkshake... They are both to die for. If milkshakes aren't your style, they have a full bar, so there's something for everyone. 

As far as food is concerned, I highly recommend just building your own burger. There are pencils and burger order sheets at every table. I couldn't believe all the options. You can try very from a beef burger, \"fiddy-fiddy\" burger, veggie burger... Along with many other meat options. You can choose your meat rub, bun type, toppings, sauces.... There are literally infinite options. Don't be afraid to get creative! Every thing is tasty! Burgers come with homemade chips... And they are amazing. 

I also have to add that I very much enjoyed the decor. :) 

My friends and I all left with full and happy tummies! I can't wait to return to Burgatory soon!"}
{"text":"Hallelujah - a veggie burger that doesn't taste like pure mush! Their vegan veggie burger is made with cremini mushrooms, lentils, cashews, and a ton more veggies, herbs, and spices which gives it fabulous flavor and texture. It can be eaten like a legitimate burger on a bun. So delicious. This restaurant actually cares about quality and as much as possible they source good, local ingredients. Burgers are served with house-made crunchy chips and they have a ton of house-made dipping sauces.  
Their entrée salads are also very fresh and the portions are huge, served with house-made salad dressings. Don't even get me started on their shakes. Vegan milkshakes are now offered in vanilla, chocolate, and peanut butter, plus each week they feature a 'Shake of the Week'. Only thing is prices are pretty expensive. Beers are $9 a pop and entrées are expensive too."}
{"text":"Second time here. Lunch today. Everything was excellent. My burger was awesome, and my friends get Shorty sandwich was amazing. Service was very good, but a little bit slow."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Burger are wonderful!  Also have a nice variety of vegetarian and alternatives to beef.  Can be a bit loud, but a really fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place and the food is awesome :) must have: espresso love shake. Also the portobello steaks appetizer is very good!"}
{"text":"Yelp helps again!  I was here last week and got a little ambitious as I ordered a burger with fries and a shake!  This was the only thing wrong as the meal defeated me.  Now onto the rest of the story.  The burger was a make your own buffalo burger and it was excellent and cooked perfectly for medium rare.  My waitress helped create the perfect combination of items for the burger and my fries were nice and crispy.  Lastly the nutella crisp shake was excellent!  It's slightly price but excellent all the same."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now and my experience has gotten worse each time. I had such high expectations for Burgatory and the new location that just opened in Mccandless crossing meant you can't go wrong correct? Dead wrong. I'll review my most recent experience. 

We arrived about 4:45 on Friday night, before the dinner crowd arrived and were seated. I was feeling some nachos so we ordered the six napkin nachos. They came with chili, cheese, jalapeños, corn and a bunch of sour cream. These things were downright disgusting. The cheese had no taste, the chips were stale, and the jalapeños didn't taste anything like jalapeños. They put a ton of corn on them with very little chili. I told the waitress I didn't like them. She took them off the table. My sister ordered the mortys steakhouse burger and said it was good. I got the Buffaloed Bison. The waitress recommended that be cooked with a little pink (I usually get well done burgers). The fries had a Cajun taste to it, but all I could taste was fryer grease. The burger was just ok. Wasn't crazy about it. I went home and felt slouchy and then sat in front of my toilet waiting to throw up for an hour. I had just a bad taste and feeling inside me which was perhaps from the pink in my burger. My bill came to $22 for just the burger and a vanilla milkshake. Luckily the waitress removed the nachos from the bill, but this girl had an attitude pretty much from the moment we sat down. 

Final conclusion of this place is that I am not impressed and will not be returning to any burgatory location. I think they hired prissy girls off the street who have nothing but sour puss faces and horrible attitudes. The milkshakes are way too strong and they put way too many pretzels, marshmallows, etc. in the shakes and the burger selection is very poor. If you are looking for a good burger place go to BRGR or Red Robin in cranberry. Those places are much better. Better food, better selections, better milkshakes, better dining, and better customer service. Very disappointed in Burgatory!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  The milkshakes are all delicious, haven't had one that I don't like yet!  An I love the create your own burger slips, all the already put together ones sound good but I just love that I can make it my own.  They also have a great selection of beers that most places don't have, all very unique.  The only thing that would make this place so much better for me is if they would have turkey burgers!  Oh an the new check in before you get there app is great, something should always do because it is always busy.  I've never gone there when there wasn't a wait for a table!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, nothing beats the combination of a perfectly grilled burger and a delicious milkshake.  It is truly the classic American meal, and a popular burger joint called Burgatory is bringing new life to that traditional combo.  This place backs up its slogan, Helluva Burger and Heavenly Shakes, by providing its customers with an array of burger choices and an inventory of creative and delicious shakes.  Though Burgatory is located the Waterworks Mall in Aspinwall, after dining here once, I came to the conclusion that it is definitely worth the forty minute trip.

One of the main themes of this burger joint is customization.  They do provide a burger list consisting of about eight premade arrangements, but to truly satisfy a craving, one can indulge in a completely custom burger creation.   The customization goes as deep as choosing the particular rub you want applied to your burger before it is thrown onto the grill top.  Also, choosing how well-done you want your burger cooked is as easy as picking a color from a crayon box: red, pink, or no pink.  For me, the decision to order a custom burger was easy; however, deciding what kind of creation I wanted to build was a much more time consuming process.  

After staring at the vast variety of toppings and choices on the custom burger sheet for about ten minutes, I finally decided on my burger fate.  I chose to upgrade my meat to the dried, aged Wagyu beef.  Yes, the prime piece of Kobe beef totaled to a four dollar upcharge, but it was worth every penny.  I also concluded to top my burger with Amish Gorgonzola cheese, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, sautéed onion, roasted tomatoes, and mixed greens.  Be careful when adding the gourmet toppings to your burger because they can make the price for your meal go up very fast.  The total price for my towering creation came to a whopping seventeen dollars.  Indeed, it may have been the most expensive burger I have ever eaten, but it was also the best. 

My burger came delivered to my table with a pitchfork pierced through the center of it, and a piece of paper with my name on it was positioned between the prongs of the tiny, red weapon.  The burger was magnificent.  As I cut through the center of it, the juicy, red liquid from the medium rare beef oozed out all over my plate.  Packed between the two ends of the brioche bun was my perfectly cooked red piece of meat with all the fixings I had ordered: it was absolutely perfect.  My first bite of the burger made my brain signal to my mouth to go in for more, and before I knew it, my plate was empty, and my belly was full.

Although my stomach was already satisfied, my brain told me I wanted more.  I needed to order a milkshake.  The flavor options ranged wide from PB&J to a caramel pretzel blend.  I opted to make my decision easy and order the weekend special.  To go with the season of Valentine's Day, the crew was spinning a chocolate covered strawberry shake.  The pint glass full of deliciousness came topped with a massive serving of whipped creme, and the usual cherry on top was replaced by an artfully decorated chocolate covered strawberry.  Slurping up every last drip of the heavenly shake was the perfect way to end my flawless meal.

Burgatory takes the cliché fast-food slogan of \"Have It Your Way\" to a whole new level.  By combining mouthwatering menu items with a one-of-a-kind dining atmosphere, this place creates one hell of an experience that will have you coming back for more.  If you are in the mood to spoil you stomach and satisfy your sweet tooth, I would highly suggest venturing to try Burgatory's sinful spin on the American classic."}
{"text":"To make a play on a Field of Dreams quote \"If you build it, they will come,\" I would like to think of the new Burgatory as \"If you build it bigger, it will still be packed.\"  My mom and I came here at 1:45 on a Monday afternoon when most places would not see every table packed, and this place was hopping and full of people.  The 10min wait gave me a chance to walk around and see the beauty and detail the owners made sure was given to the new restaurant.  I love it.

So, the food.  It is just as delicious as the other location.  The Bangkok steak fries, in my opinion, is the most delicious item on the menu.  I could order one for an appetizer and one for my meal.  I think they should start offering pieces of the fried mushrooms as a burger topping.  

My custom burger was cooked perfectly with all of the toppings that I had asked for, and it was mouthwateringly good.  Is it just me, or does it get harder and harder to build a custom burger when I know whatever they serve me I am going to love.  It just makes things so difficult.  My mom's turkey sandwich had me questioning if I should stray away from my normal burger choice the next time I come here.  It was extremely good.  If you don't like burgers, I would definitely recommend Hurky's Turkey.

Finally, the shake.   Ohhhhh Burgatory shake how you do such terrible things to my stomach.  But as the board in the restaurant says: The shakes are healthy if you don't think about it, soooooo don't think about it, and enjoy their amazing shakes.  They are worth all the calories in the world.  

Every time that I have come to Burgatory, I have never had a bad experience.  All of my friends who I have brought and family members who I have brought to Burgatory when they are in town all agree that this place is something special.  Even when I have had to wait over 2 and a half hours, the management staff soothed it over by giving my family and I a free appetizer for our patience.  I hope Burgatory keeps expanding their reach so I won't have to drive so far to enjoy my favorite meal, but until they do, you can bet that my last meal on this earth will be taking place in Burgatory."}
{"text":"Starting off, the greater wasn't very greedy. She asked my two friends if they would like kids menus, and they are both in high-school!! The greater stared us down and laughed! After we said NO! She said \"Well you're short sooo\", which was completely and utterly depressing and rude. But, the food is goog, I guess."}
{"text":"Our past two visits at this location have not gone well. Last time my husband's burger was nearly raw, and it was so dark in the restaurant that we couldn't see our food, so he didn't realize it until he was eating what tasted like raw meat. They remade it and brought us a huge basket of fries, and only charged us half price for his burger, so we left feeling a little better about it. Until we made another visit.

On this visit, we went on a Tuesday at 7-ish. We were seated right away, and then weren't greeted by a server until almost ten minutes had passed. Then a server came by and said that our actual server was really busy, and that he was going to get us drinks while we waited. So we ordered drinks, and waited. And waited. And waited. Drank our drinks and waited a bit longer. Then our server arrived and said she just finished training, and now she was overwhelmed by being on duty. 

We had our orders all ready to go, but then discovered that there's no way to get kid's side orders of chips or fries without the spicy seasoning. :/ Despite having had them that way on our previous visit. Whatever. So we got no side at all, but still paid for the whole meal. The food took even longer to arrive, and any time we needed something (more mayo, drinks, etc.), it was a very long wait. So disappointing. We were there for 90 minutes total, just to get a burger and a grilled cheese, and then a milkshake to go. This isn't a good trend in their service overall. Let's hope it's short lived."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Now that's a burger!  Burger was hot with fresh produce!  Bun had a great taste and the chips were perfect!"}
{"text":"We came here in hopes of a good burger and drinks. We started off with a local beer and the strawberry basil shag. The strawberry basil shag was so tasty. It was a combination of fresh strawberries, basil and vodka. It is the perfect summer cocktail.

For appetizer we ordered the Pomme Frites with Truffled Gorgonzola. This was amazing! They do not skimp out on the cheese. We enjoyed every part of this appetizer. For our burgers we ordered the Elk Burger and the Meat Your Maker Burger. Our favorite was the Meat Your Maker burger. It had great flavor and was just perfect. It was made with dry aged wagyu beef with sweet onion crust, aged gruyere, roasted tomatoes, organic greens and truffled shallot aioli. 

Definitely check this place out if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"In from Cali, and the stars given to this place were RIGHT ON! Awesome burgers/service."}
{"text":"The create your own burger is a dangerous thing.  So good!  Malts were great. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"During my visit to Pittsburgh, I ventured out to Burgatory in Fox Chapel / Waterworks on the advice of others on Yelp.

THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.

Ordered the \"Meat Your Maker\" and it was simply a very tasty burger.  I didn't like the fact that the burger came with chips instead of fries but I quickly solved that by ordering onion rings.  The onion rings were huge, by the way.

Finally, the Smore's Shake.

Quite simply it was the greatest milkshake that I've ever had in my life.  It was chocolatey and had ground up graham crackers in it and it just made the greatest and most flavorful texture that I've ever experienced in a milkshake.  

They describe them as \"heavenly shakes\" and yes... I was in heaven with every single sip.

5 stars.  Come here, come often."}
{"text":"Currently attempting to pick up a call in order. Walked in, greeted & sent us to the back  registers. Upon reaching the registers, three people looked at my friend & I & after speaking to someone FIRST, (being that we were NOT greeted) I was told, the person who took your order will be right with you.. she walks off.... um ok? So now we're standing here, at this counter unsure of what to do next...somewhat of a time crunch since our van driver was waiting outside -We're both from out of town might I add & Definitely used to a higher caliber of service from mc donalds... let alone a 14.00 burger joint. Let's just say as of now I'm not impressed. Haven't even tasted the food yet because the carry out exchange was so terrible I've lost my appetite."}
{"text":"I got the phat patties veggie burger on lettuce wrap. The burger was flavorful as always, it's a must try for flavor, but the lettuce wrap was disappointing. The pieces of lettuce weren't even big enough to cover the entire burger."}
{"text":"I went back today to just have some appetizers and beer with my friend. We decided to share the onion rings and nachos. BEST ONION RINGS I'VE EVER HAD! I didn't even take time to take a picture for you all (sorry) because they looked so amazing and I was starving. They are huge and then crust does not fall off/ the onion doesn't all come out at once. I would come here any day and be pleased just getting the onion rings. They also come with 2 homemade sauces which make the experience even better. The nachos were also amazing! It made me forget about the fact that they are known for burgers. I'm giving this place an extra star (I gave them 4 previously) just because these two dishes were just so good. Seriously. Get them."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this is the Location that we visited but regardless, this place was awesome! I've never been to Pittsburgh before. My co-worker took me here for lunch as he said this place has amazing burgers and milkshakes. We came in on a Tuesday around noon. We were greeted and seated immediately. Our server, Deisel, was super nice and very attentive. The menu is awesome. They have a full page of different milk shakes, salads, and burgers. They give you the option to build
Your own burger and choose meat, bun, toppings,rubs, and sauces. They have vegetarian options as well. My burger was amazing, perfectly cooked, and the chips were great too. The prices weren't bad and totally worth he finished product and experience. The atmosphere was cool and casual. I will definitely return if I'm in Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"Visited a Burgatory with my dad for the first time and we both really enjoyed it!

Both of our burgers were delicious. My dad got the Standard Deluxe burger and had not a single compliant; he said it was juicy and tasty! My burger was custom; fitty-fitty (half ground beef, half ground bacon), Buffalo cheddar cheese (good Buffalo flavor), decent sauteed mushrooms and onions (onions were falling off easy. I would do without next time), the truffled shallot aioli was great!

The only reason I give four instead of five was because of the chips and fries. The chips had no flavor...just potato. The fries are \"hand-cut\" and seasoned with sea salt and herbs. The seasoning was okkk but nothing great and I really despise hand-cut fries because they are not crunchy.

Overall definitely worth the experience!!"}
{"text":"Get a custom burger! The herbed focaccia bun is delicious but it crumbles. I end up eating it with a fork. I would pick any of the meat options. Pick any 2-3 rubs; you can ask your server what the vaguely named ones are but you probably won't remember. For a sauce, I stand by the truffled shallot aioli. I want this in a jar to take home. 

The milkshakes huge, and if you're getting a burger too, you'll be taking leftovers home. 
(Pro tip:  you can get a to-go cup for your milkshake.)

The service has always been great-- friendly hostesses and servers. The waiting app/text is convenient for when they're busy."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food is good. But the horrible staff pretty much ruins that. Had a large party but they kept seating people at the tables that could have been pushed together despite those people arriving after us. They then refused to put a national game on the tv. The food isn't good enough to be worth the service."}
{"text":"Fabulous lunch today! I've heard quite a bit about this place, so I was excited to experience it for myself. 

I had to get a milkshake. The caramel pretzel, yes please. It was soooo deliciously sweet and salty. Who doesn't love that combo?! 

I chose the \"meet your maker\" burger. I wasn't looking at the prices, this just appealed to me the most.  I mean, as soon as I saw truffled aioli, that was my obvious choice. I was so happy with this decision. The burger was juicy and tender, and you could taste the freshness of the toppings. I'm not one to be wowed by tomatoes, but whatever tomatoes ended up on this burger were flippin GREAT! 

5 stars for service. Everyone was overly friendly and we got a run down of the menu since it was our first time."}
{"text":"I have to say the food is good. As reported by nearly everyone the shakes are great. 
I had a strawberry shake and they are so rich, and in spite of the fact I don't tolerate sugar and fats well anymore I downed it. It tasted great both directions.
My reason for three stars isn't the food. The wait is long and the price to value ratio is pretty high. It is after all a hamburger.  If you are prepared to drop 20-25 per person for a burger, go for it."}
{"text":"We have been to pretty much every location now, except for Murrysville - and even though the service isn't always 100%, the food is always great. Last night I got the veggie burger and it was delicious. And the Cookie Monster shake... I can't even talk about it, so good. Plus the atmosphere always makes it feel like a fun night out. This (like our beloved Mad Mex) is another Pittsburgh chain who has the success equation figured out."}
{"text":"I have no idea how the food is.  However, the experience of trying to dine here is a chore.  I stopped by to try to \"reserve\" a table.  Can't do that.  They use an app called No Wait. A joke.  I installed the app, and put myself on the list which said 15-30 minute wait and they would text me when our table was ready.  I checked in and was told there was a 60-75 minute wait. WTF. What happened to my slot? Oh, that just got me on a list do you want to speak to the manager?  This was the second evening I tried. Same result both times. This place needs to change there system.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've already commented on this place before but if you go they have great veggie and bison burgers. Plus the assorted array of toppings and sauces make the possibilities  vast and differential. I love their focaccia bread, it has a great bite  and helps hold the burger together. It doesn't get all wet and thin from the sauce soaking into it. 

They have great milkshakes of course. Very creamy and full of flavor, try their strawberry and carmel pretzel if you get a chance. They are to die for!!"}
{"text":"This place has a decent selection of burgers to choose from. i love that fact that the beef is hormone free and none processed and that there's more than just one kinda beef. They also serve Wagyu and crab cake and veggie. 

You can customize your burger with endless combinations of toppings, sauces and spices; plus their variety of ingredients are your standard choices. I believe i tried the crab cake burger last time with arugula, tomato, red onion, spicy mayo, aioli and the memphis rub. It was just ok, they crab meat wasn't bursting with flavor but was more like a fish sandwich to me. I prefer there veggie burger which is soft but tends to fall apart to easily. I don't mind it crumbling though because all the extra toppings that tends to slide off the burger can be eaten together with a fork instead of your hands and fingers. 

The milkshakes are outta this world!!! Very creamy and fattening of course. My favorite is the strawberry and the caramel pretzel...MMMHHHH!!! It's not your average milkshake and when they say heavenly shakes...they mean it!! The price is not bad for the quality of food you get but i don't think $11 for a veggie burger with basic toppings is too fair. None the less if i am in the mood for a burger this is where i will go, not to mention the milkshake too. It's about an 35 minute drive with no traffic but id still prolly go there if it was an hour away."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm on this new diet that allows me to consume fat for 2 days straight before detoxing and cleaning out my system.

I came to burgatory wanting to eat a veggie burger because they are the best I've ever had but because I am suppose to eat fat I chose to go with the wagyu burger with the same toppings as my veggie but I added guacamole. So the burger is not what I was expecting. It was super bland and almost tasted like ground paper towels. I mean it tasted no different than McDonalds angus burger except that it's $11.50 and not $6. 

It was happy hour so I ordered the grape refresher, the waitress accidentally brought me the strawberry cocktail. No biggie but when I tasted it, it was like drinking strawberry water with a hint of vodka. No sweetness at all. When she brought me back my correct drink it was a little sweeter but still not enough. Tastes like basil and vodka in water. I decided not to say anything this time.

My burger was bland my fries on the side of my burger were cold and I don't know how when there are only 15 people here. It's happy hour so hopefully the price won't be too steep but I'm just really upset that a burger that has all the fat has absolutely no flavor. Big thumbs down on that wagyu, I should have just stuck with the veggie burger and the side of quinoa that I normally get but again it was my fat day.

Only good thing about this meal were the onion rings and vegan shake which taste just like a thin mint Girl Scout cookie. Other than that, I will never order the wagyu beef burger again. :("}
{"text":"I've been to several burger places all over the country, but this place is one of the best burger places I've ever dined at. Amazing beef quality, great fries, and the milkshakes are delicious. My personal favorite is the piggy butter & jelly burger. Once you try it you won't want anything else. Whenever I'm in Pittsburgh or driving by, I always try to order some takeout here. I only wish the franchise would expand nationally."}
{"text":"I had heard locals discussing Burgatory while in town on business. So, after bumping across the location tucked away in the most confusing shopping complex ever conceived (Robinson Center area) I stopped in for a Sunday afternoon solo lunch.

Like others seated ahead of me, I was warmly greeted and shown to a table (unfortunately it was one of those banquette-style jobs where you're virtually forced to learn everything you didn't want to know about the in-laws of the patron sitting next to you). If you choose not to sit at the bar chances are good you'll be dealt the same hand...but I understand maximizing seating during peak operating hours. Nevertheless, the place was clean in spite of the crowd.

The server (Alec) did a good job of breaking down the menu, pointing out house specialties, options and the Custom Creation \"worksheet.\" If you're an at home burger-meister, plan on spending 10 minutes or more determining which \"standard\" or Custom Creation is for you. I went with a customized, but relatively straightforward Kona crusted, hormone-free burger with sautéed mushrooms, pickle and horseradish cream sauce. As I'm trying to watch my ever-growing profile I passed on a bun but was considering both the herbed focaccia and brioche versions.

My order arrived on a timely basis and was attractively served. If you're looking for dripping grease (as we all have at one time or another) you'll be happier at the 5 Guys located a couple doors down. The meat was fresh and the sea salt and herb fries were hot and ideally crispy. My server stopped back to check on me on a timely basis and handled his section of tables easily. By the way, all staff was very friendly and appeared to be well trained. In spite of the business levels there was no sign of the panic we've all seen elsewhere.

Regrettably, I passed on a milk shake \"to go\" (remember the growing profile?) but will definitely give it a shot when I'm less disciplined. Anyway, I was surprised to leave the restaurant with a tab of around $15...which is a true value for a well served, tasty burger of my own concoction. Give Burgatory a try. And, if you see me order a milk shake to go, give me a break, ok?"}

What is going on with the noise.

{"text":"So this is one of the burger places that has seemed to get some buzz among a few other good burger focused restaurants around Pittsburgh (namely Brgr and Wingharts). So I just tried this place and had high expectations to go with the the great reviews that I have heard. 

I love their text to be seated system, so we got to spend our wait shopping at TJ Maxx next door. We get seated in about 30 min, which was pretty good considering the time we went and the popularity of this place. We said that it would be OK to sit at one of the high-top tables. BIG MISTAKE. It's as if they ordered the stools for those tables online and never sat in them to test them out. I am definitely not a fussy person about seating, but these stools were so uncomfortable that it actually affected my dining experience. I would not eat there again if those chairs were the only seating availability and that made me drop a star.

Ok aside from the seating, the food was really good. Not the best burger in town, so I had to drop a star. I started with a side salad which was excellent. The greens were very tasty and it was topeed with sundried tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, sunflower seeds, fried onions and delicious vinaigrette. I got the Morty's Steakhouse burger because I wanted to try one of their creations, rather than the create-your-own option. It was very tasty, the meat and sauce combo went really well together. The homemade chips were tasty and I think they were better than the fries (that my brother got). My burger wasn't formed well, so the meat fell apart, which didn't affect taste too much (a bit more cooked in some parts), but it made for a much sloppier dinner. 

All in all i liked this place and would go back again, as soon as the crick in my neck from those chairs goes away."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a burger tonight so I thought I'd check out Burgatory. I was at the one in Robinson about a year ago and was very impressed with the burger I got there. My only mistake was that I got a little carried away with all of the options and my burger was so tall I had trouble stuffing it into my mouth. I made it a point not to do that this time around.

I sat at the bar and was offered a draft list. There are twelve different craft beers to choose from and the twelve they decided to offer on tap are all excellent selections in my opinion. I was surprised I've waited this long to stop down here.

Looking around I noticed that there are 9 TV sets offering a view of the game to everyone who chose to sit in the bar area. The dinning area offers roomy booths and a few tables in the middle without generating a cramped in feeling.

My burger was served in about ten minutes and it was cooked to perfection. Very tasty! The bacon I opted for was thick and not like the cheap stuff you'll get at a fast food burger joint. 

The service is friendly, the atmosphere is contemporary, they have a good beer selection and my burger was great tasting. Although they're a bit more expensive than I think a burger should be, Burgatory really does get burgers right"}
{"text":"GREAT BURGERS doesn't even begin to do this place justice. I was able to order Wagyu beef (very similar to Kobe). They had things that I love like Aged Gruyere cheese, arugula, and a truffled shallot aioli sauce. I also had the sautéed mushrooms and they use baby portabellas instead of white mushrooms. They caramel pretzel shake is to die for!"}
{"text":"This is the place for delicious and unique burgers. As a lover of wine, my favorite is the MORTY'S STEAKHOUSE Burger of Peppercorn Crusted Beef with Horseradish Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, Haystack Onions & Cabernet Sauce. The crispiness of the haystack onions combined with the rich savory sauce creates quite the indulgent treat. The burgers are pricey, but for the most part worth it. They come with chips which I do not care for. The french fries are an up-charge, but are not my kind of french fry, rather bland and oily. I have not tried much else on the menu, but this is a very popular spot so I'm sure I will be returning to try other things in the future."}
{"text":"Awesome options! Love the different choice of meat (they even have the impossible burger -plant and wheat protein!) that tastes like a real burger! Great options for buns and toppings! Awesome drinks and milkshakes too! Bartender was super friendly and informative! I didn't care for the salad with the onion straws but the burger was ridiculously good with the slaw too!"}
{"text":"The pros of this place are the food, the shakes, the brews - all great.  The cons were the service and the dude.  The waitress was clearly being overworked and therefore not very attentative, didn't know her own menu, and gave me the wrong beer.  Of course, the one she gave me was awful - chili saison - who does that to beer?  That's just wrong.  The \"dude\" just killed it for me though.  One of the dudes who works there comes into the bathroom, takes a whiz, and then does a quick rinse with only water."}
{"text":"Last meal status.  If you know you're having dinner here, don't eat all day because you will want to finish every.delicious.bite.  And have a shake when the meal is done.

I always get the Burger of the Day and it never disappoints.  If the BOD doesn't float your boat, go for the Farmer Brown - I'm a person who loves fried eggs on my sandwiches and if you're here, you already jumped off the diet bandwagon and are rolling downhill to a delicious river of craft beer and meat, so go all in.  The burgers come with homemade potato chips and I love them so much that I don't miss fries (though you can fries here); they chips are crunchy and salty with just a touch of oil still on them to give them that extra crispiness.

And the shakes... If you're old enough, spike a shake and don't look back.  I'm not sure if the shot makes a difference, but the liquor actually cuts the sweetness of the ice cream so it works really well.

Aside from one time here, I've always had to wait at least 30 minutes for dinner, but the table turnover is pretty speedy and once you're seated, the servers don't rush you through your meal.  They have great servers and fresh, unique flavors on their burgers and shakes.  I don't think it can get much better than this."}
{"text":"We showed up as a party of 14 + a baby at prime time dining.  They were super accommodating to make a reservation with such a large group, and we sat down quickly once we arrived! Great food, great atmosphere. Love the custom burger option."}
{"text":"I'm not crazy about burgers but this place is great.

Their options are endless. We all went with the customized burger options and it was worth it. But let me tell you the toppings do add up! My burger was pricey in the end but delicious! Our table had the bison, wild crab, regular beef and the veggie. Everyone was pleased. I ordered mine with a side of greens, and let me tell you it's not a side. It was an entire full plate of fresh spring mix greens. We also had the steak fries which were actually portobello fries and they were awesome. The milkshakes are good here, especially the coffee and donuts! YUM!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I checked this place out soon after moving to the 'Burgh. We liked it so much that we went back within two weeks. I actually stopped my hubby from going a third time in a month because, as a dietitian, I don't think it'd be right if I became a regular at a burger joint!

Their burgers are definitely delicious. I'm taking off a star because I ordered mine medium (I like a little pink in the center) and mine came out overcooked. The second time I went I asked for mine medium rare, and I'd say it was a perfect medium. Although I'm not a huge fan of chips, their side of chips is a tasty accompaniment. We always order a side of fries as well. Also, their milkshakes are worth checking out!  I've tried the caramel pretzel milkshake and it was delicious! Never thought I'd like chunks of pretzel in my milkshake, but it created that perfect blend of salty and sweet. My only recommendation with the shakes is to pace yourself (or order it as a dessert). My hubby and I barely had room for our burgers! 

Both times we went around 8pm on a Sunday night and had no issues getting seated right away. Service was great. Our first waiter actually remembered us the second time we came and stopped by our table to say hi (see why I couldn't go a third time?!). Don't be turned off by the location of Burgatory. Although it's in a strip mall setting, the inside atmosphere is completely different. All in all, Burgatory is definitely worth checking out if you're in the mood for a good burger and shake. I have no doubt that my husband is counting down the days until our next visit!"}
{"text":"They have always been my favorite burger place in Pittsburgh since they reopened. I love all their burgers but one thing that is a most there for me is companying the burger with a milkshake. The milkshakes our awesome. 

The Bison beef there makes a great burger but if you are not a Bison person then I would suggest the Dry Aged Wagyu beef for plan B. I love it that I can make my own combinations but the Meat your Makers and Buffalo Bison are also the most two favorite burgers on the menu. The burgers come with homemade chips. I'm personally not a fan of their chips. My fiance loves them but for me they are a little too cooked or maybe even burnt for chips. If you think you think like me ask for the fries. You can substitute the chips with homemade fries which I think its far better.

For the milkshakes I suggest the Caramelized Pretzel, Salted Nutella Crunch and the Campfire S'more. My personal favorite is the Caramelized Pretzel. You get the crunchiness of the pretzels with which it comes the saltiness and the caramel's sweetness. Its basically like a crunchy salted caramel ice-cream made into milkshake. So if you like that flavor you will appreciate the milkshake. And if you would rather your milkshake not to have any alcohol you can ask them to make it non-alcohol. They also make the non-alcohol options  hard shake if you would be interested.

The staff are generally good. I think they could do better ofcourse. But the waiting time is just ridiculous on weekends. So if you planning to have burgers with the family on a weekend try either to be there early or have something planned for the time. BUT, their estimates are more than huge over-estimates. It has happened to me a couple of times that they had told me we have to wait 30 or 45 minutes for a table and we decided to finally leave. But, they called us in less than 15 minutes while we had already left."}
{"text":"Awesome place great food and wonderful service:) the menu had lots of great selections with catchy names. The burgers were amazing the buffalo burger was delicious. This place was a little on the franchise feel environment but not too over whelming. There was a nice selection of shakes and alcoholic beverages although I was to full from half of my burger to have a shake but will def go back to try a few more things on the menu."}
{"text":"A place where you can truly customize your burger experience is about as good as it gets for me. Meat eaters and vegetarians have a variety of options to choose from. The burgers were seasoned and cooked well, and the service was great. Very happy there's a Burgatory location in the North Hills now!"}
{"text":"Love Burgatory! Their burgers & chicken make my mouth water. I do wish there were more sides to choose from. I'm not a big fan of when picking up a take out order, they make the burger up ( sauce included) .. If you don't pick it up right away, it's soggy & ruined."}
{"text":"My rating has two parts-the food and the service/way issue was handled.

The food: the food is awesome! I went with the create your own burger. It was like a chose your own adventure. So many options to chose from. I went with a burger that had grilled onions, horseradish cheese, garlic mayo and probably other things that I have forgotten all on a pretzel bun. The burger was excellent. I prefer my burgers well done and you know it's s good place when they can make a burger juicy and still have it well done. My wife went a pulled fork and cheese curd appetizer. I would call it an American version of poutine. The food was great!!!

The service/manager: first things first, the server was good-friendly, quick to refill beverages, and anything else you expect in a good server. My issue came when the bill arrived.

On their create a burger form there is a bottom part that says you get chips automatically but can sub the chips for something else and they provide you with a list and a price next to anything that would have an up charge. I went with the fries and added jalapeño cornbread. The server looked over the my form and headed to the back. No mention of any issues with it.  I receive my food, enjoy it, and get the bill. I notice on the fries that I substituted were $1.5 up charge (which is fine) and the cornbread (which the menu said was $1.5) shows $3.50. Call the waiter over and tell him the issues. He says, that you can only sub one item and that was the fries. The cornbread is charged at full menu price. I say, there is 1. No mention of that on the menu, 2. There is no mention of how much the full price is. He says he will get the manager. A couple minutes later a gentleman with crazy facial hair comes over. And explains to me the same thing the server said about the second item being charged full price. I state that is mentioned nowhere on the form or even what the full price would be. When I'm done he just stares at me. Waiting for me to admit defeat. After looking at each other for awhile I say, \"well I guess that's that then. Right?\" He says yes and that's how it ends. 

If the menu had said that fine, that's on me. It didn't 1. Say what happens with additional sides or 2. How much they are. A real bait and switch.

I was disappointed with how the manager handled it. And therefore I give 5 stars on the food and 2 on the service. Not sure if I would go back just based on how the post meal went down."}
{"text":"Based on everything that's been written about Burgatory, I was expecting way more than an average burger. What did both my husband & I get at Burgatory? Average burgers, nothing exciting and seriously lacking in flavor with a side of chips that could have chipped a tooth.

Based on the descriptions, it seems like they are trying. Just not succeeding. I ordered the What-A Jerk Chicken and hubby got the Morty's Steakhouse. Both sounded like they should have had flavor for days. I detected no jerk seasoning whatsoever on my chicken burger - which is actually ground chicken, not a chicken breast which was explained by our server before I ordered. The grilled pineapple was the only flavorful item on the bun, but unfortunately 1/2 of it was the hard inside core that you can't bite through. The whole wheat bun also started falling apart on my first bite and I didn't know there was banana ketchup on it until I reread the menu description afterward.

If I had ordered an actual burger would I feel differently? I tasted my husbands burger and other than the meat itself, it was equally flavorless. He was in total agreement. His was served with an enormous mound of onion straws that try as we might we couldn't find any onions, just fried squiggles of batter.

We went there for lunch, so we didn't try the shakes. Based on our burger experience, I'm guessing we won't be coming back for them."}
{"text":"Traveled from Virginia to try this burger and it did not disappoint.  Food and service great."}
{"text":"Amazing food and bartenders at the waterfront are great, but they are overpriced and don't have a reward program and when you contact them about it, they say you can log into the WiFi as a reward? What kind of program is that and they don't give you any coupons or free meals and we spend at least $60 a week there"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I go here at least every other week and spend $50 a pop which is a lot of money. Best food we can get and service is ok. Hit or miss. Hate that the seating is on top of other people but if not busy we get a booth. I wish they had a frequent diners club card though bc as good as it is that may increase their business. I never stray from the trippin chicken it's phenomenal! Grandads secret milkshake may or may not have crack in it. I got it one time and can't stop thinking about it. Thanks burg for making me gain 10 lbs the last 3 months :)"}
{"text":"Changing my review. We've been going since it opened. Last two times we noticed some slippage in both food quality and service. Maybe bad luck. Maybe not. I'll leave my former glowing review up. You decide. 
--------------------------
Best Burgers in the 'Burgh. And the competition is tough. BRGR is great. I like North Park Lounge, 5 Guys is good, too. But I really like Burgatory. I'm a big fan of the \"Morty's Steakhouse\" burger; comes with horseradish cheddar, haystack onions and Cabernet sauce. And the\"Get Shorty\", a yummy short rib sandwich. The shakes are great, too. With and without alcohol. More expensive than some, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"It must have been an off night at Burgatory. Service was subpar, the beer was flat (taken back), and the burgers were all very undercooked. They were nice in not charging us but that doesn't mean I will give it another try. Sorry Burgatory but me and you got \"beef\" (undercooked)."}
{"text":"I would agree with the other reviewers who rank Burgatory above Brgr in Shadyside. Last time I was here, I had an Elk burger with a blueberry Stilton, and it was absolutely amazing. Add a decent beer selection & the best onion rings I've ever had, and I'm sold. It can be crowded, especially on weekends, but I've never had a hard time finding a seat at the bar.

Probably the only reason to ever visit Waterworks Mall."}
{"text":"A little confused as to what the employee dress code is, but the food was excellent! Oh and Michael Irvin was at the table next to us!"}
{"text":"Got to Burgatory on a Saturday with a party of 6 to celebrate 2 birthdays. One was mine! Were told a 45 minute wait so we roamed around the shopping area until they texted us our table was ready. I think that's so awesome and love when restaurants text or call you so you can walk around. 
We were seated and our waitress came over to grab drinks. It was difficult for her to hear us a lot of time as it was really loud in there! We had a few create your own burgers that everyone seemed to enjoy. I ordered the Buffaloed Bison burger which was good and was my first experience with Bison. I liked it a lot and the ranch as the sauce was wonderful. My boyfriend got the Farmer Brown with ham and a dippy egg on top. He was in love! We both substituted fries instead of chips and they were crispy and had herbs on them.
For the shakes, the table ordered 2 Peppermint Pattie, 2 Espresso Love, 1 Monkey Business and 1 Apple Pancake Bacon. 
I loved my Peppermint Pattie, it was delicious and I was the only one who sipped mine casually throughout the meal. Everyone else ordered them as dessert and couldn't finish theirs they were so full. 
I didn't like the apple bacon milkshake, something about the apple flavor did not do it for me. 
The Monkey Business was too rummy for my boyfriend but I thought it tasted pretty good. The Espresso shake was a hit as well.
We had a great time, expect a wait, grab a drink at the bar, and be prepared to loosen your belt."}
{"text":"Got the Morty's Steakhouse burger:  Peppercorn Crusted Beef with Horseradish Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, Haystack Onions & Cabernet Sauce.  The toppings we're generous and flavorful

The brioche bun was soft and almost buttery and redeemed/balanced the intense filling flavors within it.

The meat was slightly too dense yet had signifant savoury flavor. It lacked a string maillard crisp exterior. The burgers flavors were sharp, though not poor. The sauce was a bit strong and bit too much Cabernet. 

Burgatory is a good choice in this area. I'd head back if I wasn't in the mood to fight downtown Pittsburgh traffic."}
{"text":"It gets me when someone writes a review and all they say is \"the food is crap\". If you can't explain why, you really shouldn't be writing. With that said...My husband and I had a wonderful experience here. First off, I do not easily hand out five stars. This was seriously the best burger I have ever had. And yes, I have had some great burgers. My top burger spot used to be held by a pub in Vegas but this took that away. We both did the choose your own. It was fun filling out the card. There are so many neat choices, I can't wait to go back and try more. I'd love to try the crab burger, but I can't not bring myself to not get a regular burger. We both had ours cooked \"red\" and it was so juicy and the toppings were perfect. We also had a strawberry pretzel milkshake and it was out of this world. I still think about both the burger and the shake...Service was great, we didn't have to wait long and I love the text system that they text you when your table is ready so you can go shop nearby. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"They don't get five stars because the burger wasnt mindblowing. I was expecting this horseradish sauce to hit me and I actually never tasted it. However, to my surprise they have fantastic guacamole. I mean mind blowing how great it was. We also, had a cocktail that was very refreshing and delicious. Will I come back again probably but it's not on my top list of burger places to visit in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I don't know why I haven't tried a Burgatory yet. I do tend to get turned off by these super trendy chain restaurants. Despite that, I decided I'd stop at the Murrysville location before I headed back to NEPA for another work week.

Cool interior. Great use of the industrial style and the bar looked like a fun place to watch a game. We had a group of 4 and were seated at a table in the middle of the dining area. Hello boozy milkshakes! Welcome to my life. Seriously, so good, but so rich. I enjoyed my Salted Caramel Pretzel Shake and was pumped to see I could create my own Bison Burger. The burgers were big and good. Bison burgers are like my favorite thing ever so that's exciting and I loved creating my own. Came out over cooked, but I survived. 

The highlight of our meal was our waitress wearing extremely short shorts. So many bun jokes!! (Very unprofessional, but thanks for the laughs.) It cost about $90 for 4 shakes and burgers. A little pricey, but overall it was enjoyable and tasty."}
{"text":"Delicious. If you eat here too often, you could die a premature death due to artery-clogging, calorie-packing, and waist-expanding choices you'll make here... but HEY- everything in moderation, right?

I'll keep it short n' simple:

So, get the Gorgonzola fries, ANY burger, hell... might as well go for a delicious beer from their ample selection and don't you DARE miss a milkshake. The caramel pretzel could end wars.

Delicious.

Tip: Apparently, you can sign up for a table in advance at- http://nowaitapp.com/
Do it. There's ALWAYS a wait."}
{"text":"I love Burgatory for the Bison burgers! It's such a great place for these as well as having the customizable option of making your own burger. The Robinson one is always consistent with their ingredients and how they make your burgers. (I didn't find this to be as true at the North Hills one unfortunately.) The Shakes are out of this world good and can be made non-alcoholic or to be shared with a friend! I like that they have healthy side options like the organic greens salad, quinoa salad and Napa slaw. Thank you, Burgatory!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so badly but I just couldn't. The interior and people were nice, but the crispy onions on the sandwich must have been stale because the texture was different than normal and the rest of the burger had almost no taste. It just wasn't worth the money."}
{"text":"Where do I start these people are clueless and need a lesson on customer service and cooking there meat. The menu is very confusing and hard to understand. Angle dust, psychedelic shrooms 
The staff was standing around in groups of 4-6 at a time having conversations. I had to get up and find my waitress so I could add a shake to my order. I could go on and on with this snowball experience but I think you get the point."}
{"text":"I just recently went to Burgatory and I have to tell you that I was extremely pleased with our service.

I think that I'm a little \"burgered out\" due to the proliferation of burger joints in Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas.  In order for me to give high praise, you really have to do something outstanding with your menu, service, decor, etc....  Burgatory provides a nice environment, solid menu options and great service.  However, when you compare their offerings to other burger joints, it's just equally appealing to the other burger restaurants.

We went during their \"Happy Hour\" last Friday where you can order their appetizers and beer at half off the menu price, as well as $5 well drinks.  Great deal if you can get there between 4-6pm.  Because of the price, I decided to go with appetizers for my meal.  I ordered the Fire kissed Sriracha wings, Moo Better Blues sliders, Sea Salt and Herb Pommes Frites and the Bangkok Steak Fries.  My daughter and I split the apps and my sister and niece ordered individual customized burgers.  Additionally, my daughter, niece and sister ordered milkshakes and I ordered Mike's Scratch Margarita.

The fresh cut fries were exactly as I expected them to be: hot, crispy and well seasoned. That may not seem like much, but I can't tell you how many times I've been to a restaurant that specialized in \"burgers\" and then the proprietors screwed things up by serving wishy-washy frozen fries. Ugh!  The wings were well done and the sliders were tasty.  Additionally, the $5 \"Rita\" had some mojo behind it. (You know how \"some\" restaurants water down their well drinks on special...  This was not the case.  Whew-wee!)  My only compalint was that the Bangkok Steak Fries (actually tempura fried portobello mushrooms) were on the greasy/heavy side.  Good idea gone wrong because of a leaden tempura batter.  Tempura batters should be light and extremely crispy which allows the food being fried to shine through.  This did not happen.

All in all, a very pleasant visit and a very reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"Explosive flavors! 

Close to several hotels I noticed this place was rated a lot so I figured I'd try it out.... wow. 

I created my own burger with smoked gouda cheese and their truffle shallot aoli. I don't think I've ever had a more flavorful burger. I couldn't have made it more simple. Regular beef, brioche bun, lettuce, aoli, smoked gouda, and bacon.. but damn, that aoli just made everything blend together in one meaty, juicy, flavorful bite. I devoured it with a quickness. I was also impressed with their options; Elk burger, Kobe Beef, Crab patty.. you can pretty much create any burger combination you can think of. My one complaint, I think this place is WAY better than potato/sweet potato chips. They were ok, but they're pairing such a blah side to an incredible burger, 

Since the shakes were so highly reviewed I HAD to try one... nutter butter shake was AWESOME. Thick, tons of flavor and perfectly balanced. It had a light crunch from the cookie pieces, thick and creamy ice cream, and a faint drizzle of caramel to make it just sweet enough to not think twice about your waistline. 

Overall I was thoroughly impressed. Strongly recommended this as a travel food spot near all the hotels."}
{"text":"Because my PIC (Partner In Cuisine) and I had our first date at Burgatory, this place holds an extra special place in my heart, but we don't simply keep going back out of some misguided nostalgia.  We keep going back because, quite simply, the place serves kickass burgers and shakes.  They not only serve beef, they serve chicken, wagyu beef, bison, crab, and veggie.  After you pick your meat, you have a ploethra of bread to choose from.  I only wish they had some type of pretzel bun.  Hint, hint if anybody at Burgatory reads these...On Saturdays, they have a wild game burger of the day in which they've been known to serve elk, bear, alligator, ostrich, etc.  If you are into trying \"exotic\" meats such as those, get there early because the wild game doesn't always last.  Burgatory's burgers come with home-made potato / sweet potato chips that are awesome, but for a slight upcharge, you can get a delicious salad made with real greens and a vinagrette.  Yum Yum.  If you get the salad, then you can balance out the awful healthiness of the salad with one of their many hard or non-alcoholic shakes made by a milkshake \"artist\" with ice cream they make in-house.
 
The only downside is the ridiculously long wait for a table - on a Friday or Saturday night, prepare to wait upwards of 2 hours for a table (even on a weeknight, expect at least an hour wait).  In cases of long waits and since our gluttony knows no bounds when it comes to Burgatory, there have been times with my PIC and I have gone to have a pre-dinner while waiting for a table to open up at Burgatory.  It's ridiculous actually.  I don't even know what else to say.  If you live in Pittsburgh and haven't been to Burgatory yet, you live under a rock!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it three stars because I love the chain in general, but this location did not meet my expectations at all. The shakes weren't as good as usual and took forever to come out. Add that to waiting another 30 minutes for food and it just wasn't the greatest experience. The service was just okay. The temperature of our burgers had us believing that they had been left sitting for too long. I wasn't happy about my experience at this particular location."}
{"text":"The best shakes ever! I repeat, the best shakes ever! My favorite is the S'mores shake and it is absolutely delicious. I highly recommend adding liquor to your shake if you are of age. The burgers are also pretty amazing and cooked to perfection. This is probably my favorite Burgatory location as the service has been the best."}
{"text":"Went for the first time...ordered take-out. I ordered a crab burger with a side of fries (costs $1 more). I ate 1/2 of my sandwich, many because I didn't want to waste my money. The crab sandwich was oily, full of fillers - nauseating. As for the fries, not sure if my order was an afterthought. I received halves and crunchy tips, and the amount provided appeared to be the size of a kids fry at the local fast food joins. Not worth my money."}
{"text":"Gourmet, filling burgers. You can choose one of their signature items or create your own burger, all of which come with house chips or you can sub a small selection of sides (such as fries, potato salad, greens, etc) for a dollar or two more. There are also other standard bar food options such as nachos, tacos, sandwiches, and salads, but it's worth at least trying the item for which this place gets its name. 

To start, we got Honey Habanero wings - server told us there were 8 but we actually got 10, so not sure what it's supposed to be, but these were great. Saucy, with just the right amount of kick, and it almost tasted like there was some ranch in the sauce so it was somewhat creamy as well. Pleasantly surprised with how much I liked these, although the ratio of wing vs. drumstick was off (only 2 wings, 8 drumsticks).

We also ordered the Crab Shack and Meet your Maker, both very good, and 3 of us could not finish all of these items. There's a couple of odd nuances like, they can't cut your burger for in half for you in the back, but will give you a knife to do so yourself....and you can't get it medium well, just \"pink or no pink\" - but these are minor things. I wish I had room for one of the delicious sounding shakes, which can be made either alcoholic or not,  but fortunately they make them to go (sans alcohol only)."}
{"text":"Ohhhh man, I want this place to come home with me and make me burgers every day. Every dang day.

On a whirlwind, food-filled trip to Pittsburgh, I demanded burgers and my friend suggested we go here. My friend is a freakin' genius. I took one look at the menu and immediately knew I had to have the Piggy Butter Jelly burger. It's a ground beef and ground bacon burger with candied bacon, peanut butter, habanero jelly, white cheddar, and bread and butter pickles. That is so many things I love put together into one glorious burger! It was everything I could have dreamed of and more. The habanero jelly really added a great kick to the burger and the candied bacon offset the savory portions and oh man. Oh man oh man oh man. I want it again so bad.

For dessert, I proclaimed, \"I'm on vacation, suckers!\" and ordered the Eclair Don't Care hard shake. It was HUGE. It was delicious and I'm sorry to see it's not still on the menu online. (However, there is one that involves an actual doughnut now, and that looks really interesting...) It was a delight and I would get one again if I could. 

The cocktail I had, Strawberry Basil Shag, was fine, but nothing special. My alcohol was better served in a shake."}
{"text":"Finally made a trip to the famous Burger bar mini kingdom, with my family.... Expecting to be a little more blown away than I was. The atmosphere is nice nouveau night time feel yet comfortable minus the huge bar stealing all the seating from drooling patrons. 

Down to business the burgers: high quality beef which I appreciated nice bread, but overlooked outside of my burger was completely blackened which took away from other tastes for example I could not taste the cheese. The point in having fun non traditional burgers is flavor but you lose some of that if you cook it too fast. At the risk of sounding like a pretentious foodie jerk I preferred my own smoked salmon wasabi burger, and made them for the same price. 

On the bright side I love the beer selection excellent range and FIN DU LA MONDE!!!! Belgian lovers I urged you to check that one out! But other options await you too from stouts to lighter beers. 

Last note the do not take reservations.... This just sucks it does. The average wait is an hour Friday nights but it could take longer. They expect you love walking around a strip mall to wait.... I don't love strip malls. They offer no indoor seating area for you to wait in and waiting in the cramped entrance area is Just awkward sauce.  Your other option is to dive into the bar and grab the first empty bar stool. Yea no thanks not for a party of three. If they changed this way of doing things I would eat here again I am curious to try a better reviewed location and see what I think. 

You can make a custom burger toppings add $$$ quick and pray tell why do they not you know of this while you're spending an hour plus waiting? I could have been creating my meal vs browsing for slippers :(

So far it's just ok and like many places here overhyped for quality of food they offer."}
{"text":"Ahhhh ...
So, let me start with the bad. 
This hurts me to say, but I don't think this place serves a B-grade burger. 
This burger earned a solid C, which isn't flunking ... but it wasn't \"so good.\"
Sorry. 
I came in wanting to slap the table with glee ...
All the things that make a good restaurant good are here though!
Didn't have to wait forever. 
Wait staff was excellent ... they answered all of my trick questions. 
Ambiance is great. 
Appetizers were all spot-on. 
Split a shake ... which was A+ good. 
But the burger. 
This is a burger place after all. 
They won't grill it medium. I dunno ... if you use quality, fresh meat and make your patties in-house, you should be able to serve me a medium kinda bloody burger. 
Disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic. 
Always a reliably great burger. 
I have been here several times and never had a subpar burger nor a bad customer service experience. 
Prices are pretty reasonable, given the quality and menu. 
Protip: have a shake. Booze in a milkshake is WINNING. They give you the metal mixing cup thingie with your poured shake... so you end up with ~22 ounces of shake."}
{"text":"Surrounding every great burger is a great bun... The tasty juicy burger was housed in a sweet brioche bun. It held up well considering the stacks of goodness layered within. A few too many onion straws for my taste but all in all it hit the spot and I am definitely going to make this a \"regular\" spot."}
{"text":"Love the mushroom burger great service the milkshakes are very over filling I try to remember that and get it after my meal but they are just do good I can't help but get it before"}
{"text":"Maybe it was because I was famished...or maybe it's that good. Either way, this place is great option for a burger if you're in the area.

VENUE: As to be expected with most popular restaurants, the place was packed. It's got a sports bar vibe to it. Expect a lot of people, expect noise, and expect Sports Center to be on (woot woot). 

FOOD/DRINK: I ordered the ELK GONE WILD, Medium rare. The meat is lean but flavorful. The rub gives it a great amount of flavor and the veggies and sauce don't overpower it. Even though it's a sizable piece of meat, you don't feel like you're stuffing yourself since the meat is less fatty than a regular cow beef burger.

CARAMEL PRETZEL MILKSHAKE. Just do it. There are bits of pretzel in it and it's not too sweet. I can't even. SO GOOD.

SERVICE: Our server was pretty nice and attentive - or as much as he could be given the amount of tables he was serving. We came around 2 PM on a Saturday. Not sure if it was because of the Holiday (MLK) but it was PACKED. Expect some sort of wait unless you're magic and get there at a time when there's less people. We waited 30-45minutes and they give you a notification via text so you can walk around the area. I recommend walking two minutes to the Barnes & Noble down the way. The time goes by much faster when you're reading and being an intellectual of sorts...or at least pretending to do so."}
{"text":"I was a little less than impressed with this Burgatory. I stopped by with 5 boys after we did the PNC Park tour. The greeting staff was friendly and engaging, we were seated quickly. Drink orders taken right away...so far so good! We ordered 6 burgers...5 bacon cheeseburgers and one plain burger. Being uninitiated to the place, it would have been nice to know from the server that you have to specifically order other add-ons like lettuce, tomato, onions or whatever as they are not provided otherwise. I mean, if you're going to charge me $100.00 ($120 with tip) for 6 burgers and soft drinks...what the heck...go the extra mile, talk a little, make sure your customers know what the location customs are. Oh...and the chips were below par...if they are made on site you need a more proficient hand at that wheel. For that price you should be providing fries anyway.
I never mind spending money for an equivalent return in quality. I don't think I got it here."}
{"text":"My mouth is salivating for the burnt almond torte milkshake. Holy mother of god. That was unreal. I loved this place. The burger was bomb, my milkshake was LEGENDARY, the chili delicious and a sip of my sisters margarita was yummy!  So happy to have good food coming out east in Pittsburgh. Would absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Convenient location near both PNC park and Heinz Field. Lots of TVs as one would expect in this sports town. 

The make your own burger option is fun, both my kids did that. More explanations of the options would be helpful (Angel dust rub?) I went with the standard menu veggie burger option and it was excellent.  The blood orange IPA was fab. 

Our server was cute and very patient with our questions and our taking our time to check out the menu"}
{"text":"Great Burgers... Crabcakes are good but the sandwich is uninspired. Most disappointing is that neither the signature Potato Chips nor the French Fries are properly cooked... so they're soggy... the Corn Bread is great along with the shakes... Best of all... The 6 Napkin Nachoes... incredible!"}
{"text":"I've had the Meat your Maker and the Classic, and the classic is my favorite - it's the special sauce!

Milkshakes are amazing here - salted nutella crunch is awesome. 

The chips that come with the burgers are pretty good, thick cut. I got cole slaw once but it was a little weird and spicy; more of a vinaigrette than dressed slaw. 

Expensive, but consistently good."}
{"text":"Burgatory lived up to the hype. It was jammed packed on a Sunday and the service was amazing. Loved the atmosphere but I didn't love my veggie burger much. I've had veggie burgers from a lot of places and this one is at the bottom of the list. The great service and the milkshake kind of made up for it. I didn't think it was pricey either. Paid about twenty dollars for a milkshake and a meal. Would I go back again? Probably not but I most definitely enjoyed checking this place out. My friends were right \"Why go to a burger place if you don't eat burgers?\""}
{"text":"This place was quite the find while visiting Pittsburgh.  Loved my Wagu Burger and fries."}
{"text":"Had the \"fiddy-fiddy\" custom built, half ground bacon, half beef, topped with grilled onions with shallot, mushroom aioli- naked (no bun). It was cooked to perfection. We had a large party but our server was excellent and he had each order right and was very attentive. Would love to have had one of their shakes but lactose intolerance prevented that. They looked divine. This was a first visit and we definitely want to go back."}
{"text":"Burgatory is an easy place to come to. I have never had a bad experience here. The service is always great and the food..AMAZING. I think that the only problem is the wait, but that could more so be because so many people want to come here. I recently was here for happy hour and I was pleasantly surprised at their happy hour specials. I would say that happy hour might be the way to go if you want drinks and appys. I have had a lot of their burgers but these are the ones that I recently tried out. 

Drinks:
Strawberry Basil Shag: Vintage Vodka Cocktail with a tasty combination of Fresh Berries & Basil. This one goes down way too easy. This one does go down super easy. It was delish. I would love to just have it in a water bottle and take it on a nice tropical vacation. Yum. It was fresh and not too sweet. Perfectly paired with appys and burgers!

Southern Charm: Bourbon, Vodka & Black Tea muddled with Fresh Mint & Lemon. Finished with Peach Bitters. I love a good tea boozy drink. Tea's are my thing and this one was no joke. YUMMY. I think that the fresh mint and lemon were a great addition to the drink. I would order this one again, and again, and...again. 

Appetizers:
Honey Habanero Wings: A great combination of sweet & heat. Buffalo Sauce & Bourbon BBQ available for those more traditionally minded. These were fried to perfection. I would have liked a little more sauce on them but now I know to ask for extra for next time. They were hot, so do not be fooled. I hate when some places say habanero wings and they taste like cayenne, these ones are hot so just watch out. 

Pommes Frites: Cut Fresh by Hand All Day, Every Day. Truffled Gorgonzola. A must have addition to any visit to Burgatory. Do not skip, do not pass, do not think eh, not today. Just order them and be done with it. They are great and you will be messing up  your entire experience here if you do not order them!!

Burgers:
Piggy Butter & Jelly: Cajun Dusted Ground Beef & Ground Bacon Burger with White American Cheese, Candied Bacon, Bread & Butter Pickles, Peanut Butter & Habanero Jelly. As disgusting as this sounds this was probably my favorite burger on the menu. It was so weird it was good. I loved how the taste really melded together to make something wonderful. Try it out, even if you order it for the table and everyone takes a bite. Just try it out and go from there. You will not be disappointed. And if you are at least you can say you got to try out a burger that has pb and j on it!

Elk Gone Wild: Diablo Dusted Grass Fed Elk Burger, Smoked Gouda, Caramelized Onion Marmalade & Bacon Jam with Roasted Tomato Vinaigrette tossed Arugula. This burger is spicy! The diablo dust is not a joking matter. The only thing I can say is that while this burger was good, elk is super dry because it is so lean. I was not thrilled with the taste of it and thought they could have cut it with something else to bring a little moisture in. I would probably not order this again. While good, it wasn't so great that it is on my must try again list. 

I like it here and you should too! This is a great place to grab drinks or a quick meal before a movie or to go on a nice date. I would highly recommend coming during happy hour and taking advantage of all the good deals. Maybe I will see you here!"}
{"text":"We ordered a large order (over $200) through grub hub. We picked up the food and brought it back to our location. When two individuals cut into their burger blood poured out! When I called to ask if they could remake the burger (didn't even ask for my money back) they said no and I have to call grub hub. I told them that they made the burger and asked again. She told me no. They're the ones that cooked the food incorrectly!! No help. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Coffee and Donuts milkshake was great, our burgers were not. Barely any cheese or sauce and my \"pink\" burger was dry and burnt. 
Try BRGR! They have excellent food!"}
{"text":"We tried to dine at this Burgatory location with some friends once before and left after being told that there would be a 45 minute wait (one of our companions has lupus and needed to take her medication with food ASAP), which condemned us to a dismal meal at nearby P.F. Chang's. Months later, however, after much filibustering, I convinced my darling Kay to try this Burgatory once more. 

And yet again, as if it had been an amusement park ride, Kay and I waited for 45 minutes, burning the spare 3/4 of an hour at Barnes & Noble. The mounting anticipation contributed to the overall experience favorably, making the standard dine-out night seem a little more special, particularly when it's assumed that the food will be superb, and it was, it was.

Burgers are no longer lowbrow or taken for granted. Restaurants such as Burgatory have taken something that the public had gotten bored with and transformed it into something exciting, fun, and novel again. 

Burgatory veterans know the process for a Custom Creation: Grab the tiny pencils, go over all of your options (type of meat, bun, toppings, cheese, etc.) check off the boxes on the form as carefully as one would take a standardized test, and hand it in to your server, who in our case was efficient, honest ('it's just 1,000 Island, hon' she said of their 'house sauce'...), witty, and a ray of light overall. Your burger will come to your table bearing a flag with your name on it. Aren't you exceptional?

Or you can pick a standard build (there are 10) if you want to go into autopilot like I did. Hey, sometimes ya just want to trust your chefs, y'know? Besides, how much can one play around with fixings? It gets tedious trying to figure out what will go well with what and all. Nah, this time I put myself in the Devil's hands and chose the Meat Your Maker burger. 

MYM is composed of a dry aged Wagyu patty, a sweet onion crust, Gruyere, roasted tomatoes, organic field greens, and  truffled shallot aioli. The fragrant, silky, medium-rare (a must!) beef was only augmented by the sweet rub, and the creamy,  ribald, brackish aged cape of cheese. The roasted tomatoes added a touch more sugar as did the aioli, which grounded the entirety of the Brioche-encased burger via that earthy, elusive minced fungus. 

The fries that flanked the burger were up to the usual crispy, fluffy standards I've come to expect from Burgatory. The days of the once-fried tater are dwindling, Burgatory helping to continue this positive trend of proper cookery.

Like debating whether or not Captain America could take Batman, local bon viviants have been arguing over whether Burgatory or BRGR holds the Big Gold Belt. While I feel their burgers are about equal, Burgatory does trump BRGR in terms of milkshakes. BRGR offers a fine milkshake for a summer evening. Burgatory offers an ornate milkshake for the ages. For instance, my Campfire S'mores milkshake too the stuff of Boy Scout weekend getaways and elevated it into an event of pure indulgence. The marshmallow was imperious, charred, gooey. The alabaster quagmire of whipped cream was luscious enough to ice a wedding cake. The graham cracker crumbs were there as were the pieces of chocolate candy bar. The ice cream itself was almost too thick, like quicksand, but that only helped the boba straw to prove useful and gave me an excuse to savor the frozen dessert, take my time, allow it to melt as I dismantled the garnishes. A Burgatory shake isn't to be sucked down as you stroll the Waterworks mall. It is to be treated as an opulent affair --- a Baked Alaska in a glass. 

Burgatory keeps growing and still apparently can't outrace the demand for their products. No matter when you visit one, the swanky, eye-catching interiors are brimming with laughing patrons even without having to await a table. I could express concern that Burgatory will spread itself too thin and lose something in the process,but it just hasn't happened yet. Each new franchise has been nothing but a boon to its part of town and has stood alone in areas infested with national chains. 

In other words, there is now a concrete reason to drive out to The Waterfront, and it ain't to see a movie or play games at Dave & Busters."}

Here I sat, finally locked in hellacious contest with a juggernaut of ground, naturally-raised Bison and a combination of fixings that had been conjured by the dark side of my culinary imagination. With each bite I asked myself \"What have I done?\"  Had I come up with a challenge too great for even my stomach? The soft baguette, a kind that differed from the chewy, crispy baguette I am used to, contained the innards of the burger as well as an aristocrat's hoagie bun could. 

Another lightning bolt epiphany struck me from the open skies as I gorged: Bison is the blood-red meat of immortal warriors, the kind served to the victorious on the battlefield and to the fallen in The Hall of the Slain. Its leanness, tenderness revealed a connection to the Earth and the ancient hunter-gatherers that once brought these behemoths of the plains down with arrow and spear. Its sweetness, richness made it fit for celestials.

The clash was grueling, the divinely homemade potato chips crunched beneath The Doomburger, conspiring to prematurely snuff out my bellyfire, but endure I did! \"IF I AM TO YAK THIS DAY, THEN MAY IT BE IN BATTLE\" I cried, channeling the dialogue of Stan Lee! 

And before I could comprehend it, the meat was gone. Only a few bites of bread, egg, American-and-Cheddar-usurping Gouda, and onion shafts remained, the sturdy, flavorful chips reduced to particles. Thus ended a battle that could have only been depicted justly by the late Jack Kirby in a 64-page comic book annual. 

The fog of Brimstone parted and two roads appeared to me. One promised milkshake pleasures of various kinds. The other was  guarded by The Ginormous Chocolate Chip Cookie Sundae and The Angels & Demons cupcakes. 

Feeling impetuous, invincible, I would take both roads. 

For days I had mulled over my milkshake choice, and the Campfire S'Mores won over the Caramel Pretzel. It came before I could gather my wits. A massive graham-cracker dusted marshmallow turret, one that couldn't have been bagged and had to have been made in-house was what I first noticed. I pulled it off and daringly devoured it. I sampled the whipped cream, which also tasted fresh, unprocessed. The ice cream itself was golden, hand-turned. The straw was hard plastic with a wide opening to allow for the s'more debris. Additional milkshake came in a large metal cup. I finished it all, ignoring my stomach's signals to walk away and marched towards the Cookie Sundae. The soft-baked cookie yielded to my fork as did the same vanilla bean ice cream. A few bites later, and I sensed defeat. I scooped the ice cream into a plastic cup and the cookie into a box. This fight would conclude another day. 

Knowing that my limit had been sufficiently taxed, I avoided Kay's cupcakes. The Burgatory logo had been drawn onto the plate in strawberry puree at the feet of an Angel Food/Chocolate Buttercream and its opposite number; Devil's Food/Vanilla Buttercream. 

Bourdain is a prophet. The top-heavy Angel Food collapsed upon my angry gaze! Hah! 

The arcane individual mentioned in Part One met us on the way out. He revealed himself to be The Owner/Adversary. When I mentioned that I nearly ate myself sick, he replied \"Gooood\" while rubbing his hands and grinning, seemingly impressed that I survived his machinations and his engines of temptation and indigestion. 

Kay and I made it out to the parking lot. 

*Caution. The following passage is graphic. The circumstances are entirely my own fault.*

I tried to fight it off. This hadn't happened to me in ten years and never before due to overindulgence. 

I vomited ice cream, cold ice cream, onto the asphalt. I had become a human soft serve dispenser. The Owner's cacophonous cackling deluged the lot and tormented my ears. I had finally eaten myself nauseous. I had been made into a glutton.

Kay just giggled, and I felt fine afterwards. No one else saw me spew. From there we made our way home. The next morning, I quietly finished the sundae. The ice cream had since hardened in the icebox. The cookie, after being nuked, reached the consistency of a pancake. I didn't mind and ate slowly. It was Sunday morning, and the nightmare was over. 

Pit your soul against the most lightless powers of cookery fathomable. Confront the horrors that lie within Burgatory. You will emerge from the ordeal a stronger being.

P.S. I forgot to mention that this song was playing on the Liquid Metal satellite radio station as we searched for Burgatory. I SWEAR!  Eerie foreshadowing?

{"text":"Kay wanted to shop at the Robinson Mart o' Walls but insisted on eating first. Once I remembered that a new Burgatory location had opened in the area, I couldn't think of anywhere else to eat. Strip mall ahoy!

Thinking it was a conscious decision for the both of us. I was not at all cognizant that we were placed into this position by...The Adversary. Figurines of Kay and I lay before Him on a vast chessboard. Still longing to wreck my future through his demonic machinations, The Adversary recalls previous encounters whilst watching us through a crystal ball...

As fate would have it, we arrived minutes before the Sunday lunchtime rush, narrowly avoiding a long wait by snagging the last table available at the moment, one built...for two. Fate: She is crafty. 

Industrial decor similar to that of the Fox Chapel location threatened to mesmerize us. Slogans, Venn diagrams (pentagrams?), and maps to Hell distracted us from the mission upon us. 

I looked to the ceiling and saw His visage, His...grinning visage for a split second. For the next several moments by body was under his control, and I could hear His voice in my ears, echoing, tormenting...

Our lovely server Sarah B.(Hello!) came to take our order. As if guided by unseen hands, on the notepad provided, I automatically checked off the components of a burger that would threaten to swallow my soul...whole!

\"Let's see Mr. Steel? Is it? Heh heh. You'll be having the Dry Aged Wagyu Beef on a baguette bun as you did for our virgin clash with coleslaw, bread-n-butter pickles, guacamole, onion straws, fried egg, aged gruyere this trick as well as grilled pineapple, and...oh, why not? Bacon. With fries of course. Let's not forget the Memphis rub and Truffled Shallot Aioli.\"

\"Too easy, devil,\" I spat back.

\"Oh, let's include some Braised Pork Belly Sliders also. That should finish you off before you get to MOAB or even Ginormo, the chocolate chip cookie sundae.\" 

A trio of hellpigs came armored in buttered buns, the zombie ungulates' blood running with whole grain mustard and homemade bourbon BBQ sauce. Onion straws added crunch as did the punchy coleslaw. Lard, crispy, lard threatened to strangle my aorta, yet Kay and I dispatched them with a swift brutality fueled by hunger. 

The golem of meat was constructed in a whirlwind of green mist and stumbled towards me...growling, directed by The Adversary's taloned, bony finger, carrying a demonic, pitchfork-like flag with my epitaph on it.

\"Attack, my creation!\"

Shards of salted potatoes, ideal in their blend of crisp, chewy, and soft, were caught by me and devoured, defying the monster and his master. 

I leapt upon its back, munching through the baguette hide of the creature, puncturing its supple, rich wagyu insides, the guacamole adding more decadence, the aioli turning my lunch into a Luciferian opium-laden orgy, the onion straw snakes making it near deadly. I persevered, holding the abomination's defeated body over my head.

\"Bring me Ginormo!\" I cried.

\"ROOOAAARRRR!!!\" The behemoth responded, sounding like a thousand rusty gates opening at once. 

The Adversary rode atop its back of golden vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, chocolate and caramel veins. The oven-fresh cookie was doughy, slightly salty, and dusted with powered sugar, the cold ice cream never detracting from its ductile nature. His taunts driving me, I broke down the sundae with scoops and chomps, savoring the fudge and the richness-cutting dairy products. 

As I finished the last lump of ice cream, The Adversary vanished with a look of terror and astonishment on his chiseled face. 

\"MOAB will finish him. I know this.\"

My stomach stuffed almost beyond capacity, I managed to keep nausea at bay. Sarah's adorable face was flush with relief and joy for I had conquered malevolence on this day. 

P.S. According to Kay, I have a fan (?!?) in Sarah B. Apparently I was discussed as I used the restroom prior to our departure. This one's for you, Sarah! Sorry for taking so long to put up the review!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for the first time.  I ordered the trippin chicken burger with their in house made potato chips, hubby ordered a build a burger with house made chips and their caramel pretzel shake.

What's hot
- Menu variety.  Their menu caters to a variety of dietary issues- vegetarian, grass fed beef, etc...  You may think I'm trippin, but they do have a veggie burger!  Pretty cool, especially cuz one of our family would've been able to join us, even though he gave up meat for Lent.  Don't knock it!  They also offer pretzel bread, which isn't common at many sandwich and burger joints.  Good shake options.  Unique side dishes.  Unique sauces, rubs, add one, etc...
- Flavor.  Hubby liked his build a burger.  Good options.  Both our burgers had good flavor.  Not too overwhelming.  You can taste the flavor and the burgers are not greasy.  Just enough seasoning. 
- Portions.  Goldilocks- not too much, not too little, just right.
- Awesome chips.  Crispy and crunchy, but not greasy.  Well seasoned and not too salty.
- Service. Everyone was nice, helpful, and attentive.  No complaints.
- Location.  There are other shops and restaurants in the area, which helps if you'd like to do other things.

What's not
- Happy hour specials start at 5pm, but they're only available at the bar.  Not cool.  Half off drinks and appetizers, which is a pretty good deal.  For example, hubby and I arrived a little before 5pm, so we thought we would take advantage of their happy hour specials.  Then the waitress clarified for us that their happy hour specials are only available at their bar.  I've been to many restaurants where their happy hour specials apply to all customers, regardless of where you sit.
- Price.  You get what you pay for, but just be aware that the quality of food comes with a price.  For example, I was thinking of trying their egg and potato salad side, but it's an extra $3.  You also pay for certain options for their build a burger.  Again, be aware that you may be paying for extras.
- Layout.  There's only a few booths and you have to be specific in asking for one, which hubby and I did not.  Otherwise, you're in the open and it's difficult to have a conversation.  Many tables for 2 are close together, which makes it difficult to have a conversation.  Sound carries in this restaurant.  Also difficult if you have a few belongings with you, cuz it's easy to get in the way of others.

Final answer
Would come back again."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to be harsher here, and give it a 3.

Because of SOOOO much hype about this place, I really expected heaven in my mouth. The burgers are decent, not much different than BRGR, just that you can create your own, which is great, but if I wanted to create my own, I'd make my own at home. I like a restaurant that dictates their dishes and stands behind them 100%. 
The spiked milkshakes were massive and pretty strong, but ridiculously sweet. 

Don't get me wrong, the food and drinks were all fine and dandy, just didn't have that WOW-factor I look for when a place gets so much hype and rave. Also every time I went there was a 1-2 HOUR wait. WAY TOO RIDICULOUS. Too much effort in my opinion. 

Rather go to BRGR for a closer, faster option. Same thing."}
{"text":"I think I just had the best burger of my life. I did the make your own. I stuck with classic burger ingredients. The patty was juicy flavorful and amazing. The fries were out of this world. I feel like I'm just repeating what everyone else has already said. So one last thing, just go you must try!!!!"}
{"text":"It was super busy so maybe on a slower day it would be better.  They have the single most uncomfortable seats ever.. Metal chairs that adult don't fit into properly make the two+ hours we were there very uncomfortable.  I got a basic delux burger on a GF bun.  (Awesome that that is an option). The burger was dry and tasted ok.  The fries were weird, they are small broken pieces and over seasoned.  Our waitress was awesome! The kids and other adults loved their milk shakes.  It wasn't horrible but for the price it could be much better."}
{"text":"Honor Thy Burger and Thy Mother the wall proclaims!  

Yes, a beastly sinfully good burger.  

We all had Custom Creations that are devil in the making.   

Yes to nice atmosphere.
Yes for a good shake.
Yes for a delicious juicy burger.
Yes to good chips.
Yes we had to wait about 10 minutes for our table.
Yes to a good waitress.
No to kitchen hiccups...found out it was the first day and a manager came by,  apologized and gave us some free home made chips.  She said it should not take this long in the kitchen but it was the first day and they were working to correct the problem.  Good for them to know it took to long.   
Yes to good chips."}

1. Waitress gave us menu's
2. So many options especially Custom Creation (build your own)...I was dazed.

9. Not to long and our burgers come out.  Mouth watering scrumptious looking.
10. Start eating.. this is one of the best burgers I have had in years.  Good beefy flavor, Yum, Nice rub flavors from the rub and other creations that I choose including cheese and condiments...Yum!
11. Waitress stops by to see if done or if we need anything.  Most are still enjoying our burgers.
12. Waitress stops by to check.
13. Still enjoying my burger.

15. Still enjoying my burger.
16. Finally finish.  It was sooooo gooooood I took my time to savor the flavor.

The burger was beautifully cooked, juicy and flavorful.  The chips that came with were very good.  Love the options for Custom Creation.  So many choices so little time to eat!"}
{"text":"First of all -- their Nutella milkshakes. A must have!!! They give you a full glass plus at least half a glass extra on the side for only $7 (add $3 if you want that extra liquor kick ). I would go back just for these milkshakes. 

They also sell a dry-aged Wagyu burger for really cheap - only $14.50! For those that may be unfamiliar (because I definitely was until a few days ago), dry-aged Wagyu is particularly expensive not only because it's a high quality marbly type of meat, but because of the extensive way it has to be prepared. Dry-aged meats are hung to dry and effectively lose a great deal of volume during this process and then are trimmed, causing an even further lost in weight. However the end product is a delicious concentration of rich flavor with a smooth buttery texture - how can you not love that. Unless you don't eat meat... Then I'm sorry. Their Portobello burger is pretty good.

Tl;dr -- Quick, casual, reasonable prices, and great food... what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Whatever. Any lazy incompetent cook can make edible food with a lot of meat and fat. 
Not impressive. 
This is chain restaurant food masquerading as haute cuisine. 
Try harder."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Burgatory during the Penguins game last weekend because my friend said their burgers and milkshakes rivaled B Spot in Cleveland.

Upon arriving at the stadium, we headed to the top floor and got in line. The line was long, but everything is pre-made so it moves quickly. Normally I'd be upset with the food (even the milkshakes) being pre-made, but given that it is an arena and things need to move quickly, I thought it was fine. The only issue is that things can't be custom. My hubby wanted to swap his cheese and was informed the cheese is melted on the burgers hours before the game even starts and thus it wasn't a possibility. 

So next...the price...holy smokes was it expensive.  1 burger, 1 chicken sandwich and 1 milkshake was $36! The milkshake was $9.75. A side of fries, which we didn't order was $6.50.

So taste...my hubby got the standard burger and thought it was pretty good, but not in the top burgers he's ever had. The milkshake was fair. It was a chocolate shake with brownie pieces. It had way too much whipped cream and not enough shake.

Now my chicken sandwich, The Hot Chick...it sounded amazing on paper...grilled chicken on a focaccia bun with guacamole, chipotle sour cream sauce, cheese, etc. The sandwich was huge, but the chicken was incredibly dry and I couldn't find any of the sauces. There was also cilantro with lots of stems that was hard to eat. I only ate about half because I wasn't a fan. The chips were a mix of regular and sweet potato. I liked the regular ones quite a bit. Would have loved more sauce."}
{"text":"My wife and I went in around 9:45 pm on Friday night, only to find that it was going to be at least an hour before we got a table. We were a bit too tired to wait that long, so we came back the next night around 6. After about a 70 minute wait at the bar (at which we luckily got seats right away), we were sat. Our server, Seena, was very helpful as it was our first time there. The menu was full of some great sounding burgers, but we both decided to build our own using their cool little checklist system. I went with the wagyu beef, crusted in peppercorns, with spicy ketchup, red onion, and dill served on the standard brioche. I wanted to keep it pretty simple for my first time. I also upgraded to the fries. Glad I did, they were fresh cut, and fried perfectly.
The burger was great, although I think I accidentally ordered it well done. Definitely order it medium or rare. Even so, it was still pretty juicy. The bun was soft but stable. It didn't break or mush up under the pressure. I washed it all down with a chocolate shake. Possibly one of the best shakes I've had, although there was a bit too much whipped cream.

Over all, it was a pretty great burger and dining experience. The service at the bar was so-so, but that's Pittsburgh for you."}
{"text":"This place has opened my eyes and I am eternally grateful! If you have never had peanut butter on a burger then you are doing life wrong. They have a really cool menu but also a build your own option. Different meat options are available such as elk and the fries are perfection. No matter what you order you will not be disappointed. Next time I'm in the area I have to try one of their milkshakes since everyone raves about those as well. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way to the airport from downtown.  4:30pm during the week was a good time - no wait.  I opted for the Standard Deluxe (beef, white american, lettuce, tomato, onion, sauce) \"pink\".  The burger was tasty, juicy and pink as requested.  The homemade chips were crunchy and good - wished I had requested ranch on the side - that would make the chips even tastier.
It was happy hour and draft beer was $2.50 - they have a good selection of draft beers - I went with the Purple Haze.
Service was good and if I lived here I'd definitely go back and try a shake and make your own burger- they offer a diverse selection of bread, meats, toppings.  Burgatory may be better than Burger Fi."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers. 

I ordered the Piggy Butter and Jelly for myself and a gluten free burger for my son for takeout. I was nervous that my burger would be weird. Who has ever heard of a burger with peanut butter? But it was awesome! They got everything right. From the perfectly cooked patties, to the candied bacon to the perfect buns. Everything was great. My son inhaled his burger, so I'm assuming it was good. 

I had asked them to pack the burgers desperately because is didn't want to gluten burger to mix with the gluten free. They did put them in seperate boxes. However the guy who took the order made them repack everything in new boxes again because they had put both boxes in the same bag. He didn't want us mixing them up later. Wow!

The only downside is that this place was packed at 5:30 in the evening. We really wanted to eat in but did takeout because it was packed. This place needs to open more stores."}
{"text":"Burgatory is very good, but overpriced. It's overall worth a one time visit and financial splurge, but going there consistently and custom making your burgers is going to add up to about $15-20 (minimum) each visit. I'm not a burger person, so $15 for any burger is pricey for me, but maybe not to a burger affectionado. Their milkshakes are around $6 for non alcoholic and $8.50 for alcohol, although you can put alcohol in the non alcoholic and nix alcohol in the alcoholic shakes if desired. My favorite shake is the almond torte cake shake, although I would definitely order it without alcohol because the alcohol makes it much more filling and strong. It tastes just like an almond torte cake and your first taste is nothing short of mouth watering! I also had the smores shake, which I wouldn't order again due to it tasting dull compared to others. The apple pancakes and bacon shake is surprisingly good, but once again, I would nix the alcohol. And I wouldnt recommend a shake and a full dinner. I'm a big eater but even for me, it is just way too much for one sitting. *You will leave wishing you didn't overindulge, trust me! * You can take a non alcoholic shake home though, so that is an option for those of us who cant pound it down after eating a full meal. I usually order from their pre-selected menu choices because it is much cheaper than making a custom burger ($9.50-11). I last had the \"Potluck dinner\" which was a pulled pork sandwich and I was not impressed. The pork was dry, the bun was soggy and I was very disappointed by this. However, previously I ordered the \"Ying Yang chicken sandwich\" which was out of this world good! The field greens as a side is wonderful with the dressing they put on it. **You have to request fries otherwise you will get chips. The burger options are chicken, hormone free beef, bison, elk, veggie, dry aged wagyu and crab. I ordered bison, elk and wagyu and all were very good. The elk tasted slightly different from a regular beef burger, but the others didn't taste too exotic, so I would recommend any of those patties to people who aren't very adventurous with their food selections. Overall would recommend this place but be careful making a custom creation- they have so many wonderful choices but most of those choices come with a price!"}
{"text":"Cool place with really good food. We were recently in Pittsburgh, passed by this place looking for somewhere to eat and liked the name, pretty clever, so we had to check it out, and so glad we did! The place had a really cool vibe to it, the burgers we got (elk and bison) were absolutely delicious, and the \"fork it\" appetizer was great! They give you fortune cookies with funny messages after your meal, which in no way makes sense but that's the point, I love it. Will definitely go again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I loved all the options of meat that your burger could be made out of. I believe I had bison with avacados and bacon... Where else could you get something like that!! It was very good. Plan on going back again. Down fall was the wait, and if you have a child, sitting at the bar isn't always an option."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Burgatory on Monday night for dinner.
We were seated right away and the waitress was very friendly and attentive to our needs.
I had a bacon hamburger with extra pickle and fries and a Grand dad's secret.
The grand dad's secret is a vanilla shake with old grand dad boubon in it.
The hamburger was really good the shake was just ok.
The service overall was excellent and I would definitely go back again"}
{"text":"Burger was good, though for me it's hard to mess up a burger. Disappointed there was no choice of sweet potato fries so I went with regular fries. They were limp and not very warm so they were a letdown. 12 beers on tap, about half IPA, no wheat beer but had more choices in bottles. Very busy on a Saturday at 4:00 (Pirates had game at 7:00) so I gladly sat at the bar. The two bartenders I interacted with were pleasant. If I did come here again if try a shake, the person next to me got one and it looked great."}
{"text":"Really kind of been holding of writing this review because my opinion of this place seems to go back and forth with every visit. In all honesty, I am not sure why I keep coming back (the most recent visit was because my sister had never been). To me it's a good burger, but nothing great.

I love the idea of building your own burger. At some burger joints I have a hard time finding a burger that will appease whatever my craving is that day. I am not picky at all, I am just a weird person that likes weird things.

Lets start with the shakes. To me they are pretty meh. I seriously hate that \"whipped cream\" they put on top of it. Before you say \"oh just order it without the whipped cream, dummy\", there has been multiple times that I have and they still put that stuff on top of my shake. The next issue is the price. I remember at some point they used to be cheaper or have I lost my mind? I just don't see their shakes being good enough for me to spend $7 on. I really don't. But that could be just because I tend to be somewhat of a tightwad. But honestly I am willing to spend the money if it is actually good.

The burgers last visit were pretty good. My sister tried the Farmer Brown which is a beef burger with an over easy egg, maple cured ham, and cheddar. I was only able to get a bite but it had a great flavor and she seemed to love it so that's all that matters to me. 

My burger was the Piggy Butter and Jelly (again, I like to try weird things).
It had a ground beef & ground bacon Burger with white american,  candied bacon, bread & butter pickles, peanut butter on the bottom and a  sweet habanero jelly. To my surprise, it was actually pretty good. The peanut butter and bacon complimented the burger very well. I liked the jelly but honestly I could have done without it.

My issue with this last visit was our waitress. She couldn't seem to understand that we didn't want to order our drinks until we were ready to order our food (my sister is very indecisive and we had literally just sat down so she wanted to see what they had to drink). So after asking at least five times if we were sure, she pretty much pressured my sister into ordering a coke (she does't like coke). Then when we went to order our burgers, I had missed the part where my burger was mixed with a ground bacon, so I had asked for my burger to be made with some pink in it. So she literally snaps at me and says they can't do that because there is pork in it. That wouldn't have been such a big deal to me had the people on both sides of us not heard it. But of course they did. And they stared (fun fact about ash, she hates when people stare at her for stupid reasons). But the whole time it just felt like she was rushing us. I get that you are busy and what not, but just let us enjoy our meal. 

But like I said before, my opinion changes every time I go to a Burgatory (any of the locations). But I keep giving them chances and probably will continue to do so.

But anyway, this is definitely not the best burger place in Pittsburgh by far (Check out BRGR or Tessaro's), nor is it cheap. So make sure you do your homework before coming here."}
{"text":"Nice concept.  Great atmosphere.  Average burgers. 

Came here expecting a big wow but was disappointed. Everyone made their own burger at the table and we found the hormone free beef to be too fatty. It was juicy but the grease soaked through our buns (even through the focaccia). The dry aged wagyu was super dry and over cooked. 

Even with a rub on the patties I found it to be unflavorful. The burgers came with chips but mine were too soaked in grease to enjoy. 

We also ordered their alcoholic bacon milkshake as a dessert. It was very yummy but super sweet. We shared one milkshake between 3 ppl

Overall we got great service and environment but the food was average. Five guys would have been a better choice next door."}
{"text":"Great! Bar atmosphere in the middle of the restaurant, but okay for families. 

After hubby had a build-your-own burger and I had the very yummy Hot Chick, we ended the meal with a spiked caramel pretzel shake. Yum!"}
{"text":"We went to Robinson Twp Burgatory. Its not upscsle inside and rather modest but the food is amazing. The Milkshakes are unique to say the least. I had a very tasty pretzel shake. The burgers can be created to your specs. I got a classic burger. Mouth watering and very juicey.
The service was very good and everyone was friendly. You can eat outside if you like as well. The price was reasonable.
Its a gourmet burger experience that is very special."}
{"text":"Happy with our meal and the service was good! Your classic burger and milkshake joint."}
{"text":"I really liked this place!! And that is saying something as I am not one to get super pumped about burgers. But I had the elk burger and it was on-point. I love all the topping options though it can be overwhelming asf at first. BTW if you wanna get the elk burger make certain you get it cooked medium rare or medium because it's too dry otherwise.

Our server was fantastic, I wish I had remembered her name! It was a tad slow getting our bill at the very end but that was my only complaint on service. I liked that she did appreciate my weird sense of humor when I was ordering. 

The little pitchfork things are cute too, my mom has been collecting them (see where I get my weirdness from? LOL.) 

Desperately wish they had the adult shakes in smaller portions. If I tried having a full one myself, I'd probably die of a stroke. Mmm. Sounds amazing though. Wish this place was in St. Louis (where I live full-time) or that I could magically teleport here with my mum and get yummy burgers, ahhh!!!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS & GREAT STYLE

I had dinner at Burgatory this past Saturday night. It was amazing. We came with nine people and all shared a bunch of appetizers and then moved on to our own burgers. 

Appetizers
We tried the onion rings, sriracha wings and bangkok steak fries (made of mushrooms). The bangkok fries were awesome, big juicy slices of portobella mushrooms served with a peanut sauce. These were fried but not heavy and just awesome. The onion rings rocked my world. These were obviously sliced in house, fresh fried and served with two great sauces. The peppercorn cream was my favorite and I saved it to dip my chips into later. The wings had just a bit of spice, despite the name. There was a nice sweet note in the sauce. 

Burgers
I had the Farmer Brown, a burger with ham, egg, cheddar and lettuce. The meat was juicy and well seasoned. The toppings all melded together well. It was quite a burger. The next time that I go, I want to build my own. They have these cute menu tablets on the tables with pencils where you can build your own burgers. It looks like so much fun! 

My mom got the What a Jerk Chicken burger. It was super yummy. The banana ketchup was surprisingly good. I wasn't sure it would be my things, but soooo good. The cilantro on the sandwich made it sing!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on to this place.  Amazing.  Had the create your own (it's like Which Wich for burgers).  On the recommendation of our server, tried the ground chicken with Angel Rub on a brioche bun.  Will most def return."}
{"text":"Burgatory has been my go-to burger and milkshake joint for quite some time. The staff has always been friendly at whichever location I visit, the establishment is clean, and the ambiance fits perfectly for a place called \"Burgatory.\"

I always opt for the \"Build Your Own Burger\" selection since you can customize every aspect of your burger from its bun down to the spice rub they use on the patty. I love that they give you so many options just for the bun, but I usually stick with the standard brioche bun - it's soft, toasted, and it's large enough to contain all your burger toppings. 

As for the patty, you have several different options. You can't go wrong with a typical beef patty, which is cooked to your liking (pink, some pink, or no pink). If you opt for the chicken patty, the server will usually ask if you would like a chicken breast patty or a ground chicken patty. I've tried both but slightly prefer the ground chicken patty over the chicken breast mainly because the rubs are integrated a bit better in the patty than in the chicken breast. 

I've sampled a few of the different rubs during my visits, and I've been drawn to the Diablo Dust rub the most. It gives the burger just a little bit of distinctive heat, and it's the one you can actually tell is mixed into your burger (or sprinkled on top if you opt for a chicken breast patty). Some of the rub names are a bit confusing, as it's difficult to tell what's actually in the spice blend (ex: Angel Dust = salt and pepper), but the servers are more than happy to explain the entire menu to you. 

My favorite sauce is probably their \"House Sauce,\" which is a mixture of ketchup and mayonnaise. I always write \"sauce on the side\" on my order form since I love dipping my chips in the sauce (which are homemade, thick-cut, crispy, and amazing). The few times I've opted for their fries over their chips, I've received slightly flimsy fries, so I prefer the crispier chips.
Feel free to pick whatever toppings you like. Their jalapenos are spicy, the bacon is crispy, the grilled onions are sweet and perfectly caramelized, the fried egg is served up sunny side up, and all other toppings are plentiful, so prepare for a messy yet delicious burger.

On to the shakes...oh my the shakes. They are by far some of the best milkshakes I've had. My favorites are the Cookie Monster milkshake and the spiked Espresso Love milkshake. You can ask them to add whatever alcohol you prefer to non-alcoholic milkshakes, and they can always make their alcoholic milkshakes without alcohol. All of their milkshakes come topped with a generous serving of whipped cream and their own garnishes. They're definitely large enough to split with someone else, but typically they won't split the milkshake for you. They'll be more than happy to bring you another glass and straw, but it's up to you if you want to attempt to split the milkshake in half. You're probably better off using two straws in the original glass. Sometimes, you'll get lucky and they'll actually split the milkshake into two separate glasses, but it has only been done once out of the several times I've visited - it's always worth asking, though. 

Burgatory will leave you stuffed, smiling, and perhaps feeling a little bit \"bleh\" afterwards, but it's always worth it."}
{"text":"I think they do a good job with their patties here (I always request for mine to be prepared rare). Happy hour specials are also reasonable, but the drinks are a bit on the pricier end for a burger joint during non-HH. 

I always eat my burgers without any spread (I have an aversion to most condiments) so most burgers tend to taste a bit dry to me. However, I think the patties at Burgatory are juicy enough to withstand the dry buns and veggies. Seasoning for the patty is always done correctly. The buns, however, could be a few days fresher, but I do like their wheat option. 

Overall, Burgatory is a nice casual place for drinks and a decent burger."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit in a year to Burgatory. The draw I suppose is their pad of paper with tons of choices to create your own burger by picking type of meat, rub, bun, cheese, sauce & toppings. I had a beef burger with mushroom rub, potato bun, Gouda, aioli, spinach, tomato, onion & pickles- with fries. It was cooked medium as ordered. The burger was soft, and tasted good, but it wasn't juicy. It was good, but not great. I had a Bacon Mary, which came with lemon, lime, olives & candied bacon, that was tasty. I had a Dirt shake here once that was delicious. No room for dessert today. Bartenders have always been friendly & attentive. So, it's a good place to go if you wanna create an exotic burger to your own specifications, but I've had better burgers at other places."}
{"text":"Best burger I ever ate!  I customized mine with garlic mayo and wagyu beef.  Yum!  Salad was good, too!"}
{"text":"Great menu and environment.  I love their black bean burgers since I don't eat much meat these days.  Always good to have tasty vegan options on a menu."}
{"text":"Obviously, the gourmet burger joint concept has taken hold in Pittsburgh.  From reading most of the reviews, it seems like BRGR is the \"cool\" place to go and Burgatory is the \"lame\" one.  Is it because BRGR is located right next to Spoon in the middle of the East Liberty renaissance (which is terribly in danger with the huge derelict Borders festering across the street)?

I can't say, but I can tell you that Burgatory does an insanely tremendous business.  If you don't get here around when this place opens, you're in for a long wait.  This Sunday I joined a large group for lunch here at 11:30am.  The place was a madhouse by noon.

There's a variety of \"named\" burgers with set ingredients, but my favorite part of Burgatory was the ability to customize your burger.  Literally from the bun to the rub to the cheese to the type of meat to the sauce to the vegetables to the cooking time, there are millions of possible combinations.  My salt/pepper/garlic rub, Gouda, house sauce, scallions, red onions, tomatoes, and baby spinach medium rare burger was excellent.  The house made sweet potato chips were tasty as well.  I didn't roll with any of the insanely creative milkshakes (including the much discussed apple pancake and bacon vodka one), but everyone in the group said they were great.  Someone next to me got the S'mores one that actually had a toasted S'more on top.

Although we were sitting inside, Burgatory has the ability to open a wall to the outside with outdoor seating.  Great place to hang out in the summer (if you don't mind the scenery of the Waterworks mall).

This is a solid place and I'm not surprised that it's mobbed.  I'd recommend getting here early.  Don't believe anyone who says that it's in a lame location.  There's tons of free parking and after dinner you can drop by the Fox Chapel State Store (a little ways down the mall) which has some of the best wine selections in town.

Finally, as at least one reviewer already mentioned, the music they play is excellent, best I've heard in Pittsburgh.  Any place that blasts songs from Elbow's new album is definitely my kind of place."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a long time, and finally Burgatory came to Robinson.  We ordered burgers at the office today for lunch.  I had the aged Wyagu beef with a cracked peppercorn rub, egg, bacon, onion straws, cheese, all on a wheat bun.  Homemade chips are the side.  I asked for the burger to be rare and it came medium rare, but I'll let that go this time.  This is one damn good burger.  You won't be disappointed or hungry afterwards.  Actually I may need to take a nap.  We also ordered the Morty's Steakhouse burger and the Phat Patti's Veggie Burger.  No one was disappointed.  We will definately be ordering again and again.  We ordered our food to go at lunchtime and there was a line out the door to get in."}
{"text":"The service was very good, the server was informative and nice. 

The adult milk shakes are delicious! We had the salted caramel pretzel with caramel vodka and the Choco Taco. Both were great!

The food was also delicious. Would love to return and try different things."}
{"text":"I went here in a group of 8 and we waited 15 minutes to sit down; not bad at all for a Saturday night. While we were waiting we saw a girl, who ended up being our server, leave the bathroom without washing her hands. Anyway, I got the veggie burger and it was delicious! However, my friend asked for medium and the burger came out extremely pink. We told our server Lacey and she didn't do anything  about it when we mentioned it to her. My friend only ate two bites of her meal and she still got charged for the $10 burger... also my friend got a lemonade and Lacey didn't mention that it wasn't free refills so he got charged for two. Overall I had a good experience, but my friend didn't... I would go back for the food maybe not for the service."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! First, the staff was very nice and made great recommendations. The food was delicious and the Nutella milkshake (which was on special) was phenomenal. I'll definitely be here again."}
{"text":"I'm torn about what rating to give. The burger was very good (and really thick, which I like). But it lacked salt, which is a negative, and the prices offended me so much I couldn't bear to give it over 3 stars. It just doesn't need to cost as much as it does. Milkshakes probably even worse of a deal than the burgers."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying, I consider Burgatory to be the gold standard when it comes to burgers. To this day, the \"meat your maker\" burger in particular is THE best burger i've ever had. I've searched far and wide for something that's at least comparable and nothing has compared. I had to pleasure of dining at Burgatory last nite with family. I ordered the meat your maker burger as i always do. Tasted as good as i remember it the last time. I also ordered the Choco-Taco hard milkshake which was delicious! Despite my obsession with Burgatory, nothing really blew me away this time (i've eaten there before, so i wasn't shocked by how good the food was). The service was good as always. I just can't say the whole experience was exceptional.....I'm a Pittsburgh native who moved to Tampa about 4 years ago. Burgatory is the one restaurant that i wish i could move to Tampa (the burgers are that good). Burgatory management: if you're reading this, please consider expanding south!.... If you've never eaten at any of the Burgatory locations, you don't know what you're missing. I urge you to check them out ASAP! You won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"I wish you could give half stars, because I would give this 3 and a half stars.  But I'm bumping it up because it is MUCH better than BRGR AND because their shakes were phenomenal.

I went there with a few friends one evening for dinner.  It was a weekday, so we were surprised to find that the wait time was about an HOUR!  One nice thing they do here, though, is put you on the waitlist and then take your cell number -- and TEXT you when your table is ready.  I thought it was a nice way to get past those little pagers that more restaurants give you -- because you're not tied down to some small range.  

We killed a little bit of time shopping while waiting to get our table and it made the wait a lot more manageable.

The decor of the restaurant is cool -- it is winter so they had their patio area screened in and they had these AWESOME fire-looking heaters.  

Our server was very friendly and prompt with taking our order.  I tried the Espresso Love milkshake and my friends had the Monkey Business and the Guiness Float.  My milkshake had a great flavor, but I found the chucks of espresso beans to be a bit off-putting.  My friend LOVED her Monkey Business shake and was kind enough to let me try it -- and it was DELICIOUS.  Our other friend said the Guiness float was... interesting, but not his favorite.  The shakes were HUGE and came with a metal cup with \"overflow\" shake in it -- neither of us could finish the whole thing!

We ordered the truffled fries -- so tasty!  I think I am in love with truffles!  I probably ate a few too many fries because between those and my shake, I was nearly full by the time our burgers came.

Each got a burger.  A Morty's Steakhouse for me, Farmer Brown for my friend, and a custom burger for my other friend.  The burgers took a while to arrive, but overall were flavorful.  Not the best burgers I've ever had but they were solid.  Maybe it is partly because I was pretty full from the milkshake and the fries, though!  Us two girls couldn't finish our burgers and chips, but our guy friend did finish his. I agree with one of the other reviewers that it would have been nice to have more sweet potato chips.  I would even be willing to pay a bit extra for ALL sweet potato chips, but they are kind of an obsession for me.

Overall, a good burger, but I wouldn't personally drive out of my way for it when there is a GREAT burger joint close-by in the city.  I would def. meet friends there for a burger or stop in for one if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Burgatory is currently may favorite burger in town. I love all the choices for toppings allowing me to customize to my exact desire.  I usually go with a bunless chicken burger. The chips are good; I like the sweet potato/potato mix. Lately, however, I think they've been reducing the among of sweet vs. regular which is disappointing. The shakes are super good, and there are a few that can be made gluten-free, both with and w/o alcohol! The staff is always friendly--unless you try to sit a kid at the bar. Thu hate that."}
{"text":"Burgatory is my current craving. I want it ALL the TIME! I love to design my own (chicken) burger. I love the rubs. I love the toppings. I love the chips. I love the milkshakes. I want it all, and I want it now!

One downside: The wait here is ridiculous, and it's like they're not even trying to get people seated. Several tables sit empty for 10-15 minutes. (We timed them.) They have this system whereby you get a page, and you have time to come claim your table so people drive all over the mall. I'm not a fan."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight with my boyfriend and my friend who was in town for the night. We had to wait about 50 minutes for a table but there's so much shopping and things to keep you occupied, time flies. I had the sangria to start with, sooo good I didn't even realize I was drinking it so fast! For dinner I had the crab shack. Yum, the bun was perfectly toasted and soft, the crab cake was a nice size and just so amazing, cleaned my whole plate.  For dessert my friend and I had s'mores milkshakes, seriously heaven! Our server was Kim, she was beyond awesome. She was sooo nice and knew so much about all the questions we were asking and had great recommendations. I cannot wait to go back here again :))))"}
{"text":"Just as amazing as all the other locations in the city!!! 
Changed it up a bit with having the milkshakes before we ordered lunch, great idea but wow still so filling! The Choco taco milkshake was soooo yummy and I stuck with my normal the crabshack burger. It's nice to have the consistency from each location. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because the bartenders didn't really seem to communicate, each time one girl would ask what we wanted to drink, do we want our check, etc. the other one would ask. Other than that it was perfect !!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I didn't even think I liked burgers before going to Burgatory and trying one on a whim. Their burgers are AMAZING. I have since tried several other places and Burgatory is still hands down my favorite place to get a burger - but be prepared to leave feeling very stuffed! You can choose one of their pre-made burgers or you can Create Your Own. They have every topping sauce, seasoning, type of meat, bun, anything you could ever think of. I also must recommend trying a milkshake, spiked or not they are both good. I never thought I would like spiked milkshakes, the idea of mixing dairy and alcohol just didn't sound appealing. Burgatory changed my mind again. The Espresso Love milkshake is the best milkshake I've ever had. This is always my first choice of restaurant when I feel like indulging."}
{"text":"Fresh, hot, made to order burgers and fries, and shakes that are to die for... What else could you ask for in a burger joint?! I love being able to build my dream sammich every time and indulge in differently flavored fries and extravagant shakes. Love it!"}
{"text":"Nothing great here, the burger meat is good, the bun, bacon, and toppings are ordinary. Our server was fine, but not overly friendly, he was helpful when we asked for his help, but didn't offer anything else until asked. I ordered the gluten free bun- it wasn't great, certainly not worth an extra charge. The chips taste like they came right out of a bag, the potato salad was good, but a little too smokey for me. I didn't feel the portions were worth the price. The milkshake is half whipped cream- again not worth the price. I don't understand all the hype- clearly this area lacks decent restaurants."}
{"text":"Met some friends here on a Friday evening around 9. What you'd expect for a burger place - though I didn't have a beef burger. I had a chicken breast with coleslaw on the side. A more typical order is a burger and chips (or fries for an upcharge). My friends that had burgers said they were good. You are able to order from their list or build your own. No complaints here - but nothing special to make me want to return. Lots of fun milkshakes to choose from if you feel like having dessert."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place to eat in the Monroeville/Murrysville area and decided on Burgatory.  We started with the guacamole which was good but the chips had a lot of black pepper on them making them a little too spicy.  My wife custom made her burger while I went with the Elk burger.  Both were very good.  We'll definitely be back but no chips and guacamole next time."}
{"text":"Nothing better than escaping the ordinary and going to Burgatory for an incredible burger!  We stopped by on a weekday afternoon, only a 15 minute wait!  Lucky us!

We got a great booth.  Our server was super friendly and fairly attentive.  I started with a Burnt Almond Torte milkshake with actual bits of Prantl's Torte, Vanilla Vodka & Amaretto., BJ got a Rogue Dead Guy bottled beer.  My shake was so good, BJ kept stealing it!  For our burgers, BJ ordered the special of the day, it had pulled pork and onion strings on it and was served with chips.  I did the create your own burger, with Cajun spice rubbed, spicy Ketchup, romaine, red onion on a wheat bun.  It was so good!!!  My only complaint was that it needed a bit more spicy Ketchup.  I also got fries with mine.  As much as I love this place, the truth of the matter is, no one can really have a shake, and still have room for the burger.  Next visit, I am getting a salad, instead."}
{"text":"We came in late on a Saturday afternoon.  The place was busy, but not overly packed.  They were advised of a 25 minutes wait, they took our number so they could text us and sent us on our way.

We got a table in the \"patio\" area.  Our server greeted us right away and I went straight for a Monkey business shake.  The shake wasn't very thick and I was surprised by the weird pieces of banana and the mountain of whipped creme.  But still, very yummy.

I am a fan of the build your own burger.  Loved their whole wheat buns.  My burger was very thick and perfectly cooked.  I got the angel dust and bourbon barbeque.  BJ got the Crab Shack.  Not exactly jumbo lump crab meat, it was very flavorful.  I really wanted to try the What-A-Jerk chicken burger, but was advised this isn't wasn't all white meat.  The only downside was the potato chips.  They were just taking up space on my plate.  We didn't like 'em.   We really liked it here and will visit again."}
{"text":"Ok, after four or five visits, I can officially say that Burgatory is my number two favorite place in da burgh for excellent quality hamburgers!

My reason for going to any burger joint, or any other kind of eatery, is not for the atmosphere, my goal is to put quality food in my mouth.  Burgatory certainly puts an excellent piece of meat in my mouth!

I've gone with a group of friends, and several times with single friends, and in the food I have never been disappointed.  From appetizers to burgers, everything has been plentiful, made exactly the way I liked it, made my tongue very happy, filled me up adequately, and didn't completely break the bank.

I generally opt to build-my-own burger, with the brioche bun, and whatever toppings I happen to be in the mood for.  They don't skimp on the toppings, and they're fresh and yummy.  When building your own, you have a checklist, with several columns, from choices of meat, bread, rubs, cheeses, sauces, veggies, and a few more, most of which are pick one free, then add for additionals.  The three levels of cooking are 'red, pink, brown', and they indeed arrive how you choose it.  The burgers come automatically with fresh home made potato chips, but you can upcharge for some pretty spectacular fries, and they actually come in a big enough order to satisfy, not 'tease' like at BRGR. 

I've not had a shake, but I have tasted my friend's and yup...they're pretty yummy too, but I'm not much into spending money on uber-marked up booze anywhere.

The chicken wings are pretty darned tasty and plump, and the other appetizer I had at my recent visit were the Bangkok Steak Fries. Basically three HUGE portobella mushrooms cut in half, fried in a tempura batter, and served with a peanut dipping sauce.  These were absolutely incredible and so huge I though about taking part home, but ended up just stuffing myself before the burger came.

They are on Facebook, and you can see their daily specials posted if you 'like' them, and quite often I wish I was free on the days that some of those specials come through. They truly look exotic and amazing.

I've had mixed experiences wit the service, from one gal who was about as apathetic as could possibly be - kind of a 20 year old Fox Chapel Barbie wannabee on Valium - to one boy who was determined to flirt his way into a bigger tip - but for the most part, including the most recent visit, the staff has been very professional and helpful, and efficient.

The only complaints I have are that the space can be cramped. Booths are great, and the hightop tables are fine, but sometimes sitting at a small two-top in the main dining area is a little too invasive with the folks right at the next table. Second can be the wait period.  They are BUSY during the usual main dining hours, and your wait can be two hours. Fortunately, you ARE at a mall, so if you've got some shopping to do, they will either text you or page you when your table is ready.  I suggest planning your visit for an off-time so that you can get in and get seated in a decent amount of time.  

And final complaint, just from a personal place, ENOUGH with the ad-nauseum sports TV coverage. You've got 275 TVs lining the bars and the walls...can ONE of them have something other than mindless sports channels showing?

But generally speaking, Burgatory beats the pants off of BRGR, Tessaros, Round Robin, Five Guys, and any other place I've been in da burgh that lays claim to great burgers...except one. Winghart's in Market Square still hits my tongue as the 'best'.

But Burgatory, keep doing what you're doing. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple times but every time someone suggests going, I'm on board.
I've yet to try the boozy milkshakes, but they're on my list!
The burgers though, are delicious to begin with, but you have so many options! It's hard for me to ever order anything other than building my own!"}
{"text":"Well, it seems one can not write a Burgatory review without writing paragraphs!!  Perhaps the reviews are started during the 30-40 minute waits for a table!  My review will be short as the reviews that I see here are highly consistent with my experience. 

As long as the wait is, the microbrew beers are outstanding and make the wait pass easily. We also ordered the portabella fries ... Outstanding batter ... Very light ... And the mushroom was tender and well- seasoned and delicious. The sliders were good and so were the lacey onion fries ... Not greasy and very satisfying.  

The burgers do take awhile to come but even after we were seated we finished the beer and appetizers ... This is not a painful way to pass the time while waiting!  

Note, they refuse, quite amusingly, to take an order for \"medium well\" or \"medium\". Your chooses, so to speak, are red, pink, or brown-well. No amount of coaxing would move them to make it to a different label. In any event, the pink is close to medium and medium well, and was juicy-moist and yet probably meets FDA cooking standards. 

Service is eager, bouncy and friendly at the front, bar, and table ...  You'll get great service throughout your visit. We were there on a Tuesday, and as crowded as it was at 730, we were all but alone at 900 or 930."}
{"text":"My favorite burger hands down! 

We haven't had a bad meal here- service is great and you can tell they hire happy people that take pride in their jobs. 

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Biggest burger I've ever had! I like that you have the option to build your own burger by filling out a checklist. This way you don't have to worry about your order coming out wrong (especially if you're a picky eater). Also, there are A LOT of options in case you feel like gettin' a little crazy. 

I wasn't a fan of the chips that come with all of the burgers. They were crunchy but had no taste. It's good if you put them in your burger to create a little texture variation. Also, the burger patty was HUMONGOUS! So big that it made it hard to taste the other ingredients in your burger. My gf had the veggie patty and said it had a good taste but was a little mushy (it did end up falling apart as she was eating it). 

The Gorgonzola truffle fries were a little too greasy and heavy for me. The herbed fries were delicious! 

All in all I would come again but I wouldn't go out of my way or dream about this place."}
{"text":"Went here this past weekend when I was in town with my friends for the Pittsburgh Marathon :)

Pros: The milkshakes are SO GOOD. I had the cookie shake and I downed the entire thing, I absolutely loved it!  My fries were also delicious.  They were seasoned well, but were a bit too greasy for me.

Cons: My burger wasn't as phenomenal as my Pittsburgh native friends promised me it would be. And to be honest, it was so greasy and so big I couldn't put it in my mouth. I took the bun off and cut parts of the burger and ate it but I wasn't wowed.

Overall, I would definitely come here for the milkshakes again because really they were THAT delish!"}
{"text":"Great location near airport,but allow for extra time!  Nice atmosphere,  brighter than the location in Waterworks.  Waiter was nice,  and let me order off the kids menu since I'm preggers and mostly just pick at food.  The mini cheeseburgers were cute,  but very dry.  Must be hard to time these with my husbands full size burger,  maybe they also err on the side of well done for the kiddos...but a bit of a turn off.  The fries were cooked excellently.  Waited too long for a refill and didn't receive the cucumber ribbons we ordered until we asked for them.  Menu didn't mention the feta cheese on these so I couldn't eat them.  If my husband didn't put Bleu cheese on his,  I'd had a bit of his and comment,  bastard ! But,  I could tell he enjoyed it.  Slow service for 2:30pm with not that many people."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!  Although the it is a chain it seemed to have a local flair.  Our waiter was attentive and took time to explain the menu.  I also tried the Korean Tacos.  They were ok but the sauce was watery.  The rest of the meal was great.  The burgers are excellent and the Nachos were unique in a good way."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best burgers I've had. Server was very friendly portions were huge and the quality of the food was excellent. I had the Morty's steakhouse burger which was cooked perfectly. I had a side salad which was as large as most restaurants Full dinner salad. For a salad, a burger and a soda - it was 20 bucks. Well worth it. I will most definitely be back when I'm in town"}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out after finding it on yelp and boy was I impressed!  To start things off, my waitress was phenomenal!  She was super friendly and extremely attentive.  She was very helpful when I was trying to decide what to get as this was my first time to visit.  

The amount of selections was huge!  I loved the build your own checklist that had available, but went with the Elk Gone Wild burger!  The presentation of the burger was great and the flavor was even better!  The mixed potato chips served with it had a great crunch and flavor.  

I ended with a smores shake and don't believe I could have made a better decision!  The ice cream was extremely creamy and tasty.

If your looking for a good burger in the PIT area, definitely add this place to the top of your list!"}
{"text":"I have stopped here twice, eaten the food once and never ate in due to terrible wait times. I tried the Meat Your Maker (pink) and it was delicious! I sat in the parking lot devouring this heavenly goodness along with the chips which were better than any that I've had elsewhere. One gripe is that the Market Fresh Vegetables, which on that day meant sugar snap peas with red peppers, was too greasy and over priced for the amount offered.

I really want to give this place 5 stars but the wait times are ridiculous for a place that basically makes burgers with fancy toppings. I mean come on how long does it really take to cook a burger, 30-45 minute wait for take out? I don't think so. I really like Five Guys Burger and Fries. They make a delicious, albeit simple burger; in a reasonable amount of time with the typical fixin's that most people want and your not waiting  forever in Purgatory to get it."}
{"text":"More like a 4.5 star burger joint!  Cant really think of any negatives about the place.  Food was definitely tasty, prepared well, and service was great.  Prices are average to a tad high but worth it.  Will definitely go back when in the area!"}
{"text":"Don't know what it is about this place.  But gotta say, glad our house isn't a long drive from this place and super glad we've got four toilets in the house.

Every single one of us, every single time at this place, bolts home for a deuce.

Third time was no charm.  There won't be a fourth."}
{"text":"I do love Burgatory. The milkshakes are great, the burgers are customizable, there are many side options, and the menu is pretty extensive for a burger joint. Also, they have a pretty good happy hour- half off apps and discounted drinks from 4-6pm.

The last time I went though, I was pretty unimpressed. The \"pink\" bison burger I ordered was very dry, and also, many of the prices went up with the \"new menu\". I wouldn't advise against going, I would just save it for special occasions and the novelty won't wear off."}
{"text":"I had a burger that had bacon in the patty and added rubs, sauces, etc. for a really rich, custom burger.  Not bad!  Next time I would opt out of the bacon to allow for a less well done burger, keep it simpler.

We also had Salted Nutella Crunch milkshake to share, and it was over the top.

Overall, good service and food, not a bad wait time for such a popular place, and someplace I'd visit again!"}
{"text":"Very good.  We went on a Saturday for lunch and the place was packed.  The wait was not long and service was quick.  Taking advice from fellow yelpers, I wanted to try everything!  I started with the caramel pretzel shake (great) and shared the Bangkok fries.  They were unusual and I am glad I tried them but wouldn't order them again.  My husband ordered a personalized burger which he loved and I had the crab cake.  The crab cake was ok.  I would go back to Burgatory but try something else -- no shake or appetizers.  It was wayyyyy too much food.  I ended up bringing most if it home."}
{"text":"This is a terribly over-rated burger joint. we waited almost two hours for a table. When we were seated near the window it was cold as the garage like window had leaks and was not insulated. Our waiter was surly and kept trying to rush us to order. When we did order he did not write the order down. Sure enough, he forgot to add bacon to my standard burger. In addition, the burger had a quarter wedge of lettuce on it, twice the size of the undercooked, average tasting, burger. When I asked for my bacon burger he was supposed to bring me, his solution was to bring me a plate of 4 pieces of old, cold, chewy bacon. He took so long to bring it, I was mostly done with my burger when it arrived. We ordered the espresso alcoholic shake and a chocolate éclair shake. They tasted exactly the same. Like frozen cream, not much flavor. Way too many chocolate shavings for a shake. We also ordered the worst onion rings I have ever received at a restaurant. They were soaked in grease, way too big, with the worst part of the onion as the center. They would not break as you bit in. Spewing oil as the coating crumbled off in a greasy pile.  Go to Wendy's. You will spend less than half the money and get a much better hamburger."}
{"text":"1st time to the Burgh and the locals recommended this place.  Worth the Uber ride here.  The wings and custom burger was Awesome!!   The onion rings are so big they are like huge donuts.   A+!!!   

Go Steelers!!!!"}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh for the Stadium series weekend. Sunday before our long drive home, we came here for lunch. 
Our waitress was great and patient. We ordered custom burgers from a huge order form with 50 options down to the bun.
They also have milkshakes. I got the Nutter Butter Shake and it was delicious. Filled me up a bit before my burger.
Burgers were good. Very big after your options. 
I suggest you try for sure.
We will return."}
{"text":"Just so-so. I like the concept of creating your own burger, but the chocolate shakes at Chick-Fil-A are better! The meat of the hamburger was good--I like the option of cajun seasoning...the BBQ  sauce is disgusting and the fries were okay. I'd go back for a burger, but wouldn't waste my money on a chocolate shake again."}
{"text":"I love it!!!  It is SO AWESOME!  We have been there two times and we have had terrific experiences both times.  They text you when your table is ready.  We have been told we would have 20 minute waits or longer but it is never that long!  The burgers are cooked to perfection (just the way you want them)!  And the shakes....HOLY COW!!!!  The caramel pretzel shake....out of this world!!!!  We will definitley go back!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been craving some red meat. I mean CRAVING! So, we decided to check and see if the new Burgatory was opened last night on the web site (did I mention I was craving red meat?) And to my delight they opened last weekend. It was on! We went early Saturday and there was no wait. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who had us seated immediately. The dining area is nice and clean. It didn't seemed too cramped either even we were seated on a bench seat next to another table and two more beyond that. We were greeted quickly by our friendly and knowledgeable waiter. He was spot on (I believe his name was Jeremy). We ordered. I had the Farmer Brown burger that comes on a fresh bun with an egg (runny and wonderful), Canadian bacon, lettuce, and cheese. The burger was fresh and juicy and cooked absolutely perfectly. The hubby got the build your own which was basically the Farmer Brown without the cheese and instead of Canadian bacon he got the smoked applewood bacon. The fries were crisp and light. It was amazing! And let's not forget the shakes. I chose the salted caramel which is always a crowd pleaser. The hubby got the chocolate shake which was awesome too. And to go a burger, plain for Hugo which  he thoroughly enjoyed. Terrific! Welcome to the North Hills Burgatory! We will be back for sure. And even though it is new, didn't seem to be any kinks here. Loved it!"}
{"text":"My niece had her first Burgatory shake, the triple chocolate brownie shake. She loved it! Good taste runs in the family! I had the salted caramel pretzel shake. It doesn't get any better! Awesome, as usual!"}
{"text":"Food poising!! Worst guac and chip ever!! The only one at the table who ate guac at our table and was throwing up half hr later. Dinner at this restaurant was the only meal I had the whole day. So pretty sure it was their food!!"}
{"text":"Simply put the \"Meat your Maker\" burger is the best burger i have ever had. I come to Pittsburgh on business every few months and burgatory is must for every trip. Everyone at my company is in agreement and they have become just as addicted as I have. I beg the owners to add new locations to Southern California; You will be welcomed with open arms."}
{"text":"Great great burgers. (I thought the chicken burgers were just chicken breast with the sauce but apparently they are real chicken burgers, I have to try this sometime).

I've had the bison and a regular burger there before (please get a fried egg on top). The place has good ambiance and is great for going with groups.

The one thing with a place that is so great is that you should be prepared to wait, close to an hour to an hour and half.

I always get the bourbon milkshake when I go there which is also quite tasty and filling.

Go with an empty stomach and leave happy"}
{"text":"Burgatory has wowed me with outstanding drinks, food, service, and atmosphere... Now I am even more in love since they opened the restaurant in the Waterfront. The Waterfront is only an eight minute drive from where I live. ... SCORE!!!!!! I'm so glad that I decided to join Crunch Gym in the Waterfront as well, considering I will be a regular at this restaurant. 

The food, drinks, service, and atmosphere were amazing as always!"}
{"text":"Great as always! I'm so glad they're building one in the Waterfront... But I'm even gladder they're building Crunch gym in the Waterfront too. I'm sure I'll be at the new one more than enough... Lol. 

The waitstaff is always very nice. If you haven't been here before, go! They get so busy they have to get your phone number, and text you when you're table is ready. This is completely fine by me... I wish all restaurants did this. 

This is the first time I had one if the hard shakes. I'm not a fan of milkshakes per se, but I think I'm in love with the Espresso Love shake... I will be back, hopefully to the new Waterfront location."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner yesterday - food and service were great. 

I split the onion rings and a Grand-dad's Secret hard shake with my mom - both were amazing. For my meal, I had the portebello salad and my mom had the veggie burger. Both were good, and I would definitely come back again - nothing about the salad or burger was too special though. 

It looks like a great place to watch a game, so I will be back to see one."}
{"text":"So their burgers are awesome. What is not awesome is the hr wait. And then I try to get my order in as soon as possibly because it's going to be another 45 min until the burger actually comes out. Would prob be a good takeout place. I've never had anything that wasn't awesome. It's just hard to get something in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"Yummmmm! Very impressed how they have their act together only days after opening! Although there was a long wait, the No Wait app system is fantastic... You can check your status whenever you'd like and they'll text you when your table is ready!! Truffled Gorgonzola Pommes Frites are to die for."}
{"text":"The shakes were amazing! Great portions! I wish I had gotten the Smores (huge marshmallow on top!) after I saw/tasted my friends...I got the cookie monster which was also delicious but not as good as the Smores. Made my own burger with grilled pineapple and jerk seasoning and habanero sauce. SO GOOD! My only complaint would be that the burger was so high that I couldn't fit it all in my mouth...but the flavor was great. Ordered a side of fries and wasn't able to eat them because I was so full of burger. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"It's official, this and b-spot in Cleveland are absolutely the best burger I've ever had, and I am a burger fanatic for sure!!! Stopped at hops burger bar in greensboro, NC, which was TripAdvisor #1 burger in nation, and this was better! I had the meat your maker wagyu beef burger!!! Off the charts, wife created her own- awesome as well, but mine was better.  We were super impressed with our bartender, waiter, general manager, who went above and beyond, to make a great experience.  Definitely will be back on the next Pittsburgh trip!!"}
{"text":"Spiked Shakes? Interesting. 
Didn't want to be filled with remorse from gluttony.

Burger? A-OK.
I got Meat Your Maker. Wasn't heavenly as the menu described it. 
And definitely not worth anywhere near the $13.50 I paid for it.

Fries? Soggy soggy. 
I asked them to refry them and still soggy! 
I normally wouldn't ask them to but I paid an extra $1.50 for them! 
And we aren't talking about sweet potato fries here people!

But on a plus side, thank god that there's some decent restaurant near the airport hotels! I don't feel like venturing off 15 miles and through a few bridges into the city if I don't have to."}
{"text":"Tessaro's was closed yesterday so we were in search of an alternate place to grab a burger in spirit of the spring weather. Even though Burgatory was a 20 minute drive, we were on a mission for dinner. 

The location of Burgatory is surprising - it is tucked inside an outdoor mall- so you wouldn't just stumble upon it. But when you walk in the decor is hip and trendy with black and red colors branding the spot. The waitress told us that the wait would be about 45 minutes if we wanted a table but luckily two chairs opened up at the bar.

The burgers we ordered were brilliant - one was custom made and the other which was mine was the buffaloed bison with a side of fries. My boyfriend took a bite of his burger and exclaimed \"holy s*%$ this is a good freakin' burger!\" and I more or less had the same feeling when I had mine (though the bison patty could have used a little bit more seasoning). Fries were delicious - no salt needed, and the sweet potato chips were devoured. Bartender was friendly and informative of our questions.

Yum. I want some more fries."}
{"text":"First time there and tried an \"Adult Milkshake\".  I had the Granddad burbon milkshake and thought it was the best.  The burgers are good but very large.  If the menu says that something is spicy - it's HOT!"}
{"text":"Love burgatory......   This is a great addition to the chain.     Love the build your own burger (I am picky)....    Only thing...... I absolutely hate their chairs......    My back aches every time we leave."}
{"text":"Needed a good burger and that's what I got. 

Ambience is cute with their quirky little messages. I like the custom creation options (my bf loved their fries) and I tried their sangria...MUCH better than I expected (a little too much ice though, was finished with 2 sips). I really enjoyed the jalapeño cornbread. 

My only complaint is that my waitress seemed a little tired. It happens. She was still pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"Stopped here randomly while in the area for business and ordered take out. Elk burger was really good and cooked great. Ordered it medium rare but was closer to the rare side which I'm a fan of. Rub gave it a little heat too which also was a plus. Would def be back for another burger."}
{"text":"Orlando was our server and couldn't have been more attentive.  We were sat in a booth with an open air window that looked out to beautiful fountain and flowers of Pittsburgh's Waterfront.  It was fun creating our own burgers and the appetizers were huge and delicious!  Definitely will return when in town."}
{"text":"I was prepared to throw a 4 at this place but anywhere I have to wait 40 minutes for a burger gets minus a star fo sho. The other minus is that the portions weren't very big. I finished my burger and all my fries and I am a tiny person. This place falls flat from Fat Heads, but charge about the same.

Bad things aside, I still did enjoy my meal here. The decor was fun, the plastic pitchfork forks are very fun, the burgers are tasty and the name is hip. My friend visiting from Cleveland really liked this place--and she has Melt to compare to ;). 
I ordered the Meat Your Maker and had a suspicion that not all the toppings were included. My burger was tasty all right, but only had the lettuce, tomato and fried egg (that cost $1 extra). The homemade russet chips were crunchy and yummy. We had to sit at the bar (waited about 8 min for 2 open seats) to avoid the full 40-min wait at the tables. My bartender was super nice but service was slow due to the thousands of people who choose to go here on a Friday night. 

I would go again, but like, on a Thursday night and try another burger. Some of the creations sound awesome but I will inspect thoroughly this time for any missing ingredients..."}
{"text":"Burgatory is a solid option for a burger and a beer, and is a nice alternative to the other restaurant options in the Waterfront. My husband and I enjoy checking out Burgatory as a Sunday brunch spot b/f running errands. The beer selection has something for everyone, and their bloody marys get the job done. I've had both burgers from their menu and have built my own. The one quibble I have about the build-your-own \"menu\" is that I have no clue what some of the rubs consist of. Sure, Memphis BBQ is obvious, but Angel Dust and Diablo Dust, what flavors are those? But, like I said it's a quibble. Overall a solid choice and maybe because we've only ever been a party of two, have never had to wait for a table, always a plus!"}
{"text":"Having been to two Burgatory locations (Waterfront & Waterworks) this has become one of our go-to weekend lunch places. The food, service, and atmosphere is consistent at both locations. Being kid-friendly, but not a kiddie place is also key for my husband and I, because we are cool parents. Seriously though, we enjoyed Burgatory before baby and are so pleased we can continue to enjoy it with our baby. Speaking of baby, she loves their fries."}
{"text":"My date and I came here for Valentine's Day 2018, and I have been raving about the excellent service, delicious food, and hip atmosphere since! We came in at a pretty busy time but were seated immediately at a table we really enjoyed. Our waitress was incredible. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and food, was just the right degree of attentive, and quickly served us. We created our own burgers which I highly recommend! The burgers were delicious. I had a bison burger and my date had grass-fed beef. The ingredients were amazing and presentation was lovely. The atmosphere is fun and was busy when we were there, but nobody was too loud, everyone was having a wonderful time. Considering all that we ordered, it was very reasonably priced and we can't wait to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Met friends today for an early lunch. I had the 
PHAT PATTI'S VEGGIE
Ground Cremini Mushrooms, Lentils, Cashews and Cracked Wheat mixed with about a million secret ingredients. Topped with Smoked Gouda, Baby Arugula, Tomato &  I had the guacamole on the side because I'm not a fan. (So I thought). The in house guacamole was made fresh with red onion and a kick. Really, really good. 
The entire visit made us feel welcome. Our waitstaff worked together and had us in and out quickly without feeling too rushed.
Great job.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Great service. Nice concept. Love all the options for burgers/crab cake/chicken."}
{"text":"Burgatory is one of my favorite restaurants.  I love the idea of customized burgers.  Customization can be done with the meat, lots of great choices, Ive had the grass fed beef, the bison, and the crab, all have been fantastic.  There are around eight bun choices. Also there are tons of sauce and topping choices, lots being free.  I have to say this place is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Good customer service. I got the gluttony fries. They were delicious! Took off one star because they were out of the veggie burger. Another because my friends burger took forever."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a bite before the Pirates game. While busy, only about a 20 minute wait. Good atmosphere, sat in the patio, even with the record heat.

Somewhat small, but excellent menu choices. Of course, all 3 of got a burger. Had the Piggy Butter and Jelly burger. Outstanding. Wife and son created their own burgers, both thoroughly enjoyed. Would've tried one of their craft beers, but just too hot. Had at least 10 on tap.

We'd come back!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times since they opened. I've come for lunch, happy hour, and dinner. Apps wise, the sriracha wings are delicious. I also prefer the truffle Gorgonzola frites over the cheddar jalapeno- although if you order the latter ask for a side of ranch. They recently added a gluten free bun! I was excited, I've been eating \"naked\" burgers for quite some time. The bun itself is a little cold and hard. But it is a bun nonetheless! I was happy to see it on the menu. I'm also happy that they consistently offer a cider on their draft list. My favorite cocktail is the grapes on, vodka with muddled grapes and basil I think. When it's busy the service is slow, so I would not recommend going during peak hours (11:30-2, 6-8:30)."}
{"text":"Vegans, vegetarians, and red meat lovers- lend me your ears. The Impossible Burger is impossibly delicious!! I love a good cheeseburger despite being a serious vegetarian. I've ate countless veggie burgers (and loved them) but always knowing that there's nothing that can really substitute the delicious juicy cheeseburger. I've seen the Impossible Burger on social media featured at a NYC restaurant and immediately I thought to myself that I would definitely go there the next time I ventured to NYC. And then, the impossible happened. The Impossible Burger was HERE! Right here in Pittsburgh at my favorite burger joint! I've had two so far and they were AMAZING! It definitely lives up to the hype. These burgers were not made for vegetarians, they were made for meat eaters who want a plant based alternative without giving up all the greatness of a good cheeseburger. I'm definitely a HUGE fan and I'm a little paranoid that they will disappear from the menu here! So- I highly recommend that you try it!! It's awesome!"}
{"text":"Huge burger menu -- this may be your jam, but I go straight for the little create your own sheets. I made myself a veggie burger on brioche w pickles, lettuce, etc. It was really good; the burger fell apart (to be expected when you're eating a veg burger, I guess) so maybe just get the naked option and eat it with a fork, but it tasted good. The side of potato chips was really good as well. 

There was a huge line, and it was really busy, but our waitress was attentive and sweet nonetheless. I wish I remembered her name, she rocked! 

Love it here!"}
{"text":"Our family loves Burgatory! The Phat Patti is phenomenal! It is the best and freshest tasting meatless burger around. We were super excited to discover the vegan shakes on this visit. We make a point to stop for at least one meal at Burgatory when we travel to Pittsburgh from Indianapolis. The atmosphere is casual and sporty, and it's well worth whatever the wait might be."}
{"text":"Warm stylish decor with plenty of HD TV's to watch your favorite sports....and that's just as you walk in. 

The bison burger is incredible and I highly recommend you give it a go one night. Burgatory offers several selections of buns to compliment your burger, but like Chef Ramsey would say, the meat should be the hero of the dish, so I order the brioche every time. 

The onion rings are wonderfully battered and huge. You need two people to scarf them down. The homemade chips that come with the meal are beyond addictive. 

And just when you think it can get any better... Try one of their awesome milkshakes. 

Be hungry tho, cause if you can down the onion rings, burger, chips, AND a milkshake, you belong on Man vs Food!"}
{"text":"Always a awesome place to go!! 
I seriously crave this food!!  it is the best, and before work I decided to enjoy a custom creation!!! You can't go wrong with a delicious burger, side salad and some delicious homemade chips!!! Yum!! 
Remember, you can make so many great dishes, with these awesome choices!! So much better than fast food! Burgatory thanks for another outstanding lunch!!

{"text":"I took my family in to dine this evening and it was \"as always!\" Delicious!!!  We ordered onion rings as an appetizer and my kids loved  them! Next we ordered dinners and my burger was cooked perfectly! I ordered the organic greens with it and their homemade dressing is fantastic! They had a special pumpkin  shake which was to die for!!! Yum!! We will be back again soon!!! I might have to order 2 pumpkin  shakes next time!!! Thank you Stacy!! 
                                Thank you! 
                            Very satisfied diner"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. We have been here several times and I have never had a bad meal. Burgers and shakes are awesome, but they have tons of other great options too. There is something for everyone, even a great kids menu for my son, and their happy hour specials are great. Whether it was with family, friends, or just for drinks I have always enjoyed it here. Prices are also very fair and you can sign up for their email list for great deals. Make sure you use the no wait app to avoid long waits and you will never be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night while visiting Pittsburgh, there was a 25-45min wait and we ended up waiting closer to an hour for a table. When we were finally seated our waiter was really nice and attentive but it took about 25mins to get our milkshakes. We were told the machines were down and that the cooks had to make them by hand. 

I ordered the Cookie Monster and it came out looking like chocolate milk instead and I sent it back. Our waiter brought out another for me and it was much better. There were 4 people in my party and one person ordered a salad. It took an additional 35-45mins for our food to finally arrive after the milkshakes. 

When the food finally did arrive, it was tasty but not worth the wait. Our waiter was really nice and comped our milkshakes and appetizer. Maybe we will try this place at another time if someone else suggests it."}
{"text":"I would rate this place as a pretty solid meh.  Some friends were craving a burger and I thought, \"Burgatory has the impossible burger.  WIN FOR ALL!\"

Oh so incorrect.  Service was actually great, but the food was utterly disappointing.  I opted for the build your own burger...let's review.  Impossible patty (for all typical eaters, the impossible is a vegan patty that looks and according to my carnivorous friends, tastes like beef), bbq sauce, mushrooms, spinach.  Pretty easy.  It arrives covered in cheese.  No big deal, it happens, so the server politely says it's being remade. 

False.  The kitchen scraped off all the cheese.  So I had a cold (desperately under seasoned) patty and virtually none of those extra toppings, which I still paid for.  About an hour later it was obvious they didn't make a new burger because I was sick for the rest of the day. 

Do yourself a favor, go to giant eagle and buy burgers to make at home.  Save the $18 (yep...) and your stomach."}
{"text":"When I want a burger this is my go to spot. Though it seems overwhelming, you can build your own! This will include every little detail you can imagine including the type of meat, rub, etc. If you aren't up to it, I don't think you can go wrong with any of their own burger options. 
The milkshakes... you can get them spiked! They are so flavorful and the perfect pairing for your burger. I never seem to be able to finish my burger and a shake, but it will leave your taste buds happy.
Now for the 'underdogs', their fried and nacho appetizers are equally as good. My boyfriend and I had gone for shakes and appetizers and that's enough for a full stomach! 
All in all there's multiple ways to enjoy your Burgatory experience and not leave disappointed! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The burger was much better then the first time I had one from here. I decided to build my own burger. I recommend their pretzel bun. It is delicious. Unfortunately the service here was less then average. We had to wait 10 minutes to even be waited on. He took our appetizer order first which was great however he didn't come back for our order until after our nachos came. 

He didn't come by to get refills except for maybe once. We asked for milk shake menus after our meal which he did promptly but didn't come back to take our order until 15-20 minutes later. There's only 6 selections I think 5 minutes would have been more then enough. 

He seems much to into the waitress he was chatting up. Hopefully management reads this and keeps a better eye on how their wait staff is treating their customers. 

It is a shame because the food was definitely a lot better then the last time I was here."}
{"text":"Loooove this place!! I was never a fan of burgers really anywhere, just not much of a ground beef person, when I found out they had chicken burgers I was thrilled! My sister and I both did a build a burger, there are menu options as well, and they have a variety of meats: beef, bison, crab, chicken to name a few. Also, there is every topping you can think of as well as seasonings for the burgers, a variety of cheeses (buffalo cheddar is life), and different bun selections. We also split an order of nachos. They have the perfect balance of a hint of spice with chili, cheese, and a variety of toppings. The milkshakes are to die for! Huge, delicious, and if it's your birthday you get a free one when you join their mailing list (I joined while sitting at the table)."}
{"text":"Excellent experience at Burgatory tonight.  Had the Impossible burger with honey habanero, caramelized onion marmalade, tomato and all on a lettuce bun.  The Napa coleslaw side was addictive.  Our service was great, and the atmosphere has a cool vibe.  I will be back on my next visit to the burgh."}
{"text":"Red, Pink, or No Pink. That's how you order your burger. Lot's of options for meats, buns, rubs, toppings, sides, and sauces here. My burger was cooked to a perfect \"pink\" and it was very close to rivaling my favorite burger places in CT (Prime 16 & Plan B). With a name like \"Burgatory\" this place lived up to it's name and I was very impressed with the quality and quantity. The service was very friendly and accommodating. You will not be dissapointed with your food coma here!"}
{"text":"This was the best burger place ever! I got the fitty-fitty and my wife did the veggie and it was delicious. The shakes are off the chain!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch based purely on the name and was not disappointed. Very cool place!

Seeing some of the burgers coming out of the kitchen, I opted for the smaller lunch burger, the Jucy Lucy. It was simply fantastic! Great brioche bun, crisp lettuce, savory garlic mayo and crunchy bread and butter pickles. The burger was perfectly cooked and featured a white American cheese center (caution here - the cheese was molten hot!).

And while the burger was really good, the house made chips were amazing... almost equally split between regular potatoes and sweet potatoes, lightly salted. Delicious! Great combo.

Cool place. Neat decor and funny twists on biblical passages like 'honor thy burger'.

Definitely going back to Burgatory the next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Possibly the best burger I have ever had.  The location is a bit weird, as it is in a strip mall but it worked.  The ingredients were fresh, many choices, and the build your own burger is genius! 
They are opening another location \"still secret\" but I feel this place will be a household name in Pittsburgh.
I will def. go here again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the first month it opened, service is always great and so is the food. I love being able to customize my burger when I order to make it to my specific liking. Their alcohol prices are a little on the higher side compared to what I am used to, but they have great drinks. I would definitely recommend giving it a try and using the NOWAIT app to get in line since they do not take reservations."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and loved the place. The milkshakes are delicious and I could go back and just have the milkshakes! Tried the burger with cheese and pineapple and very tasty. The chips that come with the burger is great, very crispy and not overly salty. Tried the onion rings and jalapeno corn bread and both very good. Did not care for the fork it appetizer.  The braised beef was good but didn't like the gravy over the fries."}
{"text":"Burgers are good and for a reasonable price only downside is the wait time but that's expected for the location"}
{"text":"Oh man I never have seen a place that is so good at pairing milk shakes and burgers! My advice: Share a milk shake!! Not only do they give you a large milk shake, they give you the silver blender cup with more milk shake in it so you are essentially getting 2 anyway. I built my own burger and it was absolutely tasty, very hot and juicy!"}
{"text":"In from out of town, and my friends raved about this chain so we all went. They all left at the end of the meal feeling this location didn't hit the mark. Shakes seemed off to people that have had them many times before. I ordered the crab patty burger. While not expecting a lump crab cake, I would have appreciated something resembling crab meat. Instead it looked, felt, and tasted like a stuffing patty in a bun. Bread on bread on bread. Fries were limp, undercooked, and no taste of herbs as the menu suggested. Maybe it was just this location, or they were having a bad night but this was a let down."}
{"text":"Great burgers, just wish they had sweet potatoes option for fries.  Everything else was spot on, glad they can make the burger protein style."}
{"text":"Food is good, comparable to Red Robin in burger quality/price. Service is much to be desired. Multiple visits to Burgatory resulted in the same poor, slow service."}
{"text":"The food here was good but not special.  My wife's elk burger was dry and lightly seasoned.  My pork rib sandwich tasted like pulled pork.  The meat was good but you better like horseradish!  The sauce was slapped on quickly and so thick in some places that this was all you tasted.  The fries were uninspiring.
My biggest issue is the wait.  We got there early and were seated in 20 minutes (the wait is usually over an hour).  We then waited over 30 minutes after ordering to get our food.  The food simply isn't good enough to justify an hour from when we stepped in the door to having food at our table (for those of you doing the math, I'm including the time that we waited to order).  They are so busy that the waitress doesn't have time to see how  you're doing.  And don't expect to have a quiet conversation, it is very loud there.
Go across the street, the wait time is slightly less and the food is better."}
{"text":"I love their milkshakes!  They are so good.  I had the almond butter torte shake and it was phenomenal.  This time, I didn't have a burger (but my last one was exquisite) but I did order some onion rings which were gigantic.  The dipping sauce was terrific.

This is a very new location so everything is nice and clean.   Service was friendly but inattentive.  I asked for the check and after 15 minutes, the server had still not brought it.  She had visited the other three tables around me each twice in that time period but didn't come back to our table once.  I had to run to catch her to ask for it again and she just said \"sure\" like it was no big deal that I had asked for it 15 minutes earlier.    That explains the three stars.  But otherwise, a good place."}
{"text":"I love Burgatory.   This is the third one I've been to and they are all great.   I sat at the bar and the service was fast and friendly.  I love the build your own burger concept and I've never been disappointed.   Anything with horseradish makes me happy and I got all sorts of horseradish stuff on my burger.  I was in heaven, which I guess is one step above purgatory so maybe they should change the name?

In any event, I'm a fan and wish I could transplant Burgatory to NYC."}
{"text":"YUM! I don't need a bun so a Morty's Steakhouse naked with a side salad is perfect! I always look forward to Burgatory."}
{"text":"Love the place! They've been great --I've been to two different locations, and they were consistently good."}
{"text":"The wait was ridiculous, but the burger and milkshake were so worth it. The service was good, the food was hot and probably the best burger I have had in years. 5 words Apple pancake and Bacon Milkshake."}
{"text":"The fun part is making your own burger the way you want to.  The downside of doing this is that you may end up paying more than you expect after you pile on a lot of add- ons. The onion rings are AWESOME and the spicy ketchup was delicious.  Good beer selection on tap. Didn't care about milkshakes but there's a whole lot of those to choose from as well.  Service is usually great."}
{"text":"My friend and I adventured to Burgatory before we headed into the city to see a concert. 

We waited a bit, but they have a texting feature instead of a buzzer notifier, so you can go anywhere! -- pretty cool. 

After being seated, we had good service. The shake of the day was cookie dough, and I couldn't pass it up! We both made our own burgers. My friend wishes they'd give more than just the 3 choices offered for how you'd like your burger cooked. We both enjoyed our burgers, and we would come back again. 

I gave it a 3 because I'm not going out of my way to get there anytime soon, and I don't feel myself craving it days later."}
{"text":"Many good foods here, from the shakes and buffalo wings to the fries to onion rings and of course the specialty burgers.  A bit pricey but you pay for the bar-like atmosphere.  High quality burgers and buns (if you choose the buns!) and though I love the foods here the \"plain ole hamburger\" doesn't rise up above other establishments.  The specialty items do, so props for those."}
{"text":"Came here with two friends on a Friday night. 

First of all, the waitress was very nice. It was my first time there, and she explained everything.

My friends love the Truffled Gorgonzola Fries. We ordered some. To be honest, I didn't love them. My female friend and I both got a customer burger- I enjoyed it. Her husband got ribs, which he absolutely loved.

The meal was average/good up until the awesome milkshake that we all shared (HUGE!)...we got the smores, and it was absolutely amazing! That pushed it to the 4 star realm!

Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Amazing shakes and even better then amazing burgers. Ingredients are fresh and creative. What's not to love? Servers are very friendly and helpful. A million thumbs up! 

Ps. The almond tort milk shake is to die for!"}
{"text":"Murrysville Burgatory was very good. They were very accommodating as my Father in- law wasn't able to sit at the high top tables so they got us a regular table and chairs in minutes. The server, Frank, was awesome. He made sure our glasses were filled and refilled all of the time. He brought out our appetizers and food timely and perfectly spread out enough so our table wasn't overwhelmed with all the food all at once like some restaurants do. All of our food was delicious. The only issue we had was a couple of the chicken wings appetizer wasn't cooked well enough. Everything else was so good. We had so much food we took some home and had enough for lunch the next day. All of our MTO burgers were made exactly how we wanted them to be. It was fun to create our own burgers. My 2 girls were with us, who are 12 & 9 and they thought that it was just great to create their own food. It was a fun experience. I am glad my son decided to have his 21st birthday dinner there.
 Oh, I almost forgot, my son got an alcoholic milkshake and he enjoyed that. My daughter's both got vanilla milkshakes and they enjoyed them as well."}
{"text":"I gve this a 4.5 stars!  I usually go to the burgatory by robinson mall, but I was around waterworks one time and tried this location.  Both locations are pretty much the same to me.  The Robinson location might be a little bigger?  The burgers are always good, shakes are amazing, service is good.  

I think it's cool how you can make your own burgers and they have wagyu beef, which is delish and if you have an adventurous palate, they also have elk and bison burgers, both of which my fiance said he loved.  He said the elk was lean.  He had it cooked medium and liked it that way.  They also serve them with these homemade chips that are so tasty!

I love the shakes here and they give you both the glass and the ones in the tin, so they give you a lot compared to the ones they serve at brgr.  You can take the rest to go aa long as it doesn't have alcohol of course.  Burgatory hands down beats BRGR at milkshake battle.  My fave is the salted nutella crunch, which they can spike with chocolate vodka.  I'm drooling just thinking about this shake!

The only downside is that they don't take reservations, and it's really crowded around happy hour time to close, One time my friends and I had to wait 2 hours.  We went several times during lunch time at the one in Robinson and never had to wait, but at the Waterworks location, we went on a tuesday afternoon around 1:30 and there was a wait, so luckily the bar had room so we just chose to sit there.

Definitely one of my fave places!"}
{"text":"Yummy creamy milkshakes and thick juicy burgers!  Love all the milkshakes and they give you the extra for it.  I usually get my burger pink but since my pregnancy, I had to get no pink and the burger was still perfect and juicy!

Their build your own has a lot of choices.  Even the kids menu sounds delish to me!
If you don't eat burgers, they do have a chicken sandwich and other sandwiches and salads.  

Burgers will come with sweet potato and russet potato chips.  I've never had a problem with the chips, but there are other side options for an extra $1.50.  I would get the salad or sea salt fries.  The deviled egg potato salad was no bueno.
It was bland. The wait can be long sometimes, but it's worth it to me when I'm craving their food."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Yes, Burgatory offers a good hamburger. No, a burger is not worth what they charge for it. But wait, there's more. You will also overpay for everything else, like onion rings. And the price of domestic beer? Don't get me started. Almost $50 for LUNCH with a friend. Basic burgers one side of onion rings and four beers plus tip for 50 bucks? 

And there's also lots of \"I'm doing you a favor\" attitude from the wait staff and bartenders."}
{"text":"One of my family's favorite burger places. Great gourmet burgers, fun milk shakes, good beer selection.  Cons are long waits and the seats at the \"tall tables\" are very narrow and uncomfortable. I have been recommending it to all my friends. But don't be boring...get a crazy different mix of toppings, rubs, etc. Make it worth the wait by getting something that you can't get elsewhere."}
{"text":"After months of waiting - I've finally gotten to experience Burgatory!!! IT waws so difficult to decide on a burger or create my own, but I ended up going with the Meat Your Maker burger. It was a dry-aged waygu burger with a sweet onion rub, roasted tomatoes, field greens, truffled shallot aioli, and smoked gouda. I swapped the gryuyere for the gouda. The burger was delicious! An amazing combination of flavors that all popped - especially the roasted tomatoes. I was a tiny bit disappointed because even though it was waygu, my burger was on the dry side....so I think it was slightly overcooked. 

The hard shake I decided on was the Burnt Almond Torte and it made my eyes roll back in my head! Spiked with amaretto and vanilla vodka and swirled with chunks of Prantl's Bakery burnt almond torte. The shake was also topped with a dense whipped cream which held up candied almond slivers. As delicately as I could, I inhaled it!

The truffle-oil and gorgonzola fries are perfect! The truffle oil really stands out and the gorgonzola crumbled on top gives it that extra zing of flavor....a must try!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here about five times.  The first couple times were okay but it's gone downhill.  Something about their food always seems too salty.  Spotty service, average food.  There are better places nearby to get that burger fix.  Try Stack'd in Shadyside or BRGR in East Liberty.

I'd like to add that this is one of the most overrated restaurants around.  Not exactly sure why so many people like it."}
{"text":"Had a burger which was cooked to a perfect medium rare and delicious.  The homemade chips are good, really liked the sweet potato ones.  The coleslaw was very good, no added sugar and not to creamy, just right.  Sat at the bar for lunch and the bartender was very nice and she was drop dead gorgeous, tall blonde.  Just a pleasure to see while eating a great meal."}
{"text":"Update on the original review, I think the guacamole recipe has changed because it's way better now! So that's good. Impossible burger is still amazing. Also the house margarita and the cucumber cocktail are both delightful.

One downside though. The brioche bun is apparently made with pork lard according to a server, which was very helpful to the vegetarian in our party, that seems super ridiculous though from a baking standpoint. Brioche doesn't require lard it just requires an oil. Bit upsetting because it's far and away the best bun. I'm not a vegetarian so I still get it but it's a step down for those who are.

Also ... and this is kind of nitpicky, but the parking lot on the side is pretty small which is totally fine, the movie theater side has tons of parking ... I feel like employees should be parking on the movie theater side."}
{"text":"I haven't gotten my food yet, but this salted carmel pretzel milkshake I just had is amazing. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger joint.  I got the elk burger and it was cooked perfectly.  Good buns to round out the burger.  Very chain type vibe and that would be my only reason for not giving it 5 stars.  Friendly staff, quick service, delicious food.  Would  recommend to anyone looking for a burger joint in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I am a steadfast fan of the Waterworks location but this one comes in right up there. The service is always so friendly and efficient. That's something that can become  sidebar at busy chains whether local or national. I just love being able to create my own burger and I come up with something different on each visit. And the shakes, alcoholic and non-alcoholic are to die for. Seriously one shake is a meal in itself. If you want to gain one million delicious pounds, have a shake...mission accomplished."}
{"text":"This is the only location I've ever been to. Incredible how many there are now. Each time I've gone the food has been exactly as ordered. And who doesn't grow tired of an adult milkshake?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I've been to the McCandless and North Shore locations many times. When I was a meat eater, I loved their hormone free beef on a brioche bun with roasted garlic mayo, avocado, onions and romaine. 

Now I'm a vegetarian and I love their vegan veggie burger, vegan cheddar and their amazing vegan shakes! They're super accommodating with my veg needs! TODAY for the first time I had their IMPOSSIBLE burger! It was so delicious and literally tasted EXACTLY like beef! It was crazy! We had their BOD with pickles, lettuce, mayo and vegan cheddar! It was delicious!

Their shakes are amazing! When I eat dairy, I love their caramel pretzel shake. Ooh it's tasty! I love vegan Oreo shake and the dunkaroos one! (It was a special)

This place is especially unique and only produces AMAZING food. Hands down, favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh."}

{"text":"I went there for a belated birthday meal, I had heard how great everything was and I was super excited to especially get the burnt almond cake milkshake, and it did taste awesome, but it was jam packed with like what seemed like ten pounds of sliced almonds, I could barely enjoy the shake without having five almonds in my mouth in every sip, and as much as I wanted to take the shake home and strain out the almonds I couldn't because of the alcohol in it. I got the meat your maker burger, and it was really good, but I figured it would have more taste to it, with all that was on it. And not a fan of fries with the skin on them, even the ones that aren't burnt TASTE like their burnt. I'd definitely go back and try the burger with the peanut butter and jalapeno jelly on it, and ask that the almonds be left out of the shake, or if it's in there, to be strained. Maybe I'll give a better review then."}
{"text":"Visiting from Hawai`i and I have to say Burgatory was amazing!
This is my second time to a Burgatory chain and I wish we had one in Hawai`i. This is hands down the BEST burger I've ever had!
Tonight I visited this location with my bf and his family. With the NoWait app we were promptly seated (highly recommend using this app) The music wasn't too loud and we really appreciated that. Our server, Chris came and took our order and the wings we ordered for our appetizer came out quickly and we dug in. The manager, Kirstin, came out and let us know that the deep fried portobellos we ordered were gonna be a little delayed. She said the portobellos were on the house! That wasn't necessary but we really did appreciate it. Then Chris came out and said they forgot to give us one of our portobellos and gave it to us! WOW! At this point we were very blown away by the attentive and friendly staff.
Thanks for an amazing dinner to Chris and Kristin!
I would probably come again for the burgers but I am definitely coming again for the amazing staff! Outstanding job, made us feel like royalty."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVED our waiter here. He was attentive and hilarious and really made the experience great.

Came here for lunch with some friends before catching a flight out of PIT. I got the farmer brown burger (beef burger, over easy egg, maple cured ham, farmhouse cheddar) and friend got Morty's steakhouse burger (peppercorn crusted beef burger with horseradish cheddar, haystack onions & cabernet sauce - \"like the greatest steak dinner you've ever had reincarnated as a burger\"). Very tasty! Comes with housemade chips or fries. Mmm. All very tasty! Was also tempted to order one of their \"adult\" shakes but since I was catching a flight out, I didn't want to be to stuffed, since I couldn't take any leftovers home.

One thing that wasn't so great.. they bring fortune cookies at the end of the meal. I love fortune cookies BUT my fortune said: today is the day you meat your maker. I get that \"meat your maker\" is the name of one of their signature burgers BUT I was 2.5 hours from getting on a plane across the country so I wasn't all that amused.

Luckily I'm still here."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Burgers I've ever had. The wagyu beef, with cracked peppercorns, garlic mayo lettuce tomato onion with farmhouse cheddar, topped with a brioche bun, was deliciously yummy. Oh and by the way all the kids and wifey loved theirs too"}
{"text":"I just have to share with yinz how much I LOVE their spiked milkshakes!  I know, I know...it's a burger place.  It's called BURGATORY for gosh sakes!  But, gosh darnit, those shakes are killer!  I just had my second one today, the S'Mores, and it was beyond amazing...

They bring it to you with a huge seared marshmallow in a large 20oz glass, with a tin of the extra inside.  It's supersize American all the way, and I love it!  It's made with vanilla ice cream and chocolate liquor, with tiny graham cracker crumbs inside.  The first milkshake I had was the Almond Torte, which is made with Prantl's Burnt Almond Torte with vanilla vodka and amaretto.  I'd have to say this is a close call between which one is better.  Either or are gonna satisfy your sweet tooth.  

Okay, so the burgers.  Still good.  Still a lot to decide on!  They give you a whole sheet of options to make your perfect burger.  Seriously, any way you've ever thought of making your burger, I'm sure you could get it here!  I always go with the whole wheat bun (to make myself feel better about that shake) and my only gripe is it falls apart as soon as you pick it up.  So I usually eat the burger with a fork.  I had come here when the place first opened and I wasn't too into the chips they server with the burger.  They were a little limp.  Now they're nice and crunchy, still with the mix of sweet potato and regular.  

I just hope they bring a Burgatory closer to town...although that boozy milkshake will be calling for me!"}
{"text":"My friend told me she cried after drinking a shake here. Because it was THAT good and it made her SO full! I kinda felt the same after devouring the ENTIRE boozy S'Mores shake in one sitting! Sad fact: they also give you a tin half full of the good stuff, so you're basically sucking down like 20oz of boozy ice cream deliciousness!

I have to make mention of the shakes first and foremost, because they're my jam here! Don't get me wrong, I think the burgers are fantastic, and number two on my top burger list in the city, but Winghart's takes the top prize. 

So since the shakes are my first priority, the food is secondary. I've had the burgers at the Waterworks location and they've been fab, but I need to concentrate my massive calorie intake on the good stuff. So I got the psychedelic portobella, which is a porto sandwich on focaccia with roasted red peppers, incredible smoked gouda and this bomb garlic mayo that pulls it all together. Oh yeah, it also comes with greens:)

I had it at the Waterworks location and it was a way bigger portobella, so that made me a bit sad, but it was still good. And seriously, it was secondary to the magical shake!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best burger in Pittsburgh.  Many others have commented on the great milkshakes, the toppings, the bun, etc., but for me it comes down to the hamburger meat.  It is high-quality, freshly ground, and hand-formed into patties, giving their burgers incredible flavor, in a form that just melts in your mouth.  Nothing else can compare.  I'd probably come here every day if it wasn't for the 3,000 or so calories I consume on every visit. And I split my burger and shake with my wife!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Burgers, chicken and fries are all good. So good that even the kids finish theirs which doesn't happen often. Service is good and restaurant is clean. Get here early though because it gets busy quick."}
{"text":"Lunch with department co-workers. Stupendous unique burgers. I would not order a burger when eating out but
 ' when in Rome...' Great surprises! Mangia!"}
{"text":"This is a family friendly establishment and is a great place to enjoy a meal with kids! We came with 5 adults and 3 kids- one 3 year old and 2 under 2 and they were very accommodating. Our waitress was so sweet and helpful and checked in on us multiple times throughout our meal. She never made us feel like a nuisance and even split our check 3 ways for us so it was easier for us to pay. They have a great kids menu and little games for the kids to draw on in the menu. 

They have some unique burgers and you can also create your own if you are feeling particular about toppings. We tried the bison and the elk burgers, medium, and they were both pretty good. The elk burger was a little too spicy for my taste, but the bison was pretty juicy and had a very unique flavor. Could definitely tell that it wasn't beef. The burgers come with chips and we upgraded to fries for an extra $1.50, but honestly, I preferred the chips! It is a mixture of potato and sweet potato chips- yum. 

You HAVE to get a shake when you visit! They are decadent, sweet, and so worth it. I got the nutella crunch one and it had the perfect texture with a bunch of candy mixed in too. It's definitely not an everyday thing but makes a great special treat.

It is not cheap (our burgers were $14.50 each, plus $1.50 for fries and $6.50 for the shake) but it is definitely worth it once in awhile for a delicious meal if you want to go somewhere with your kids. Easy parking too."}
{"text":"I've been in here twice. I don't eat meat so I got the crabby patty it was ok, nothing to rave over. My daughter just had a regular burger and that night she was sick from it. It was so greasy it must have upset her stomach. The second time I went and I got the portabella mushroom sandwich and it too was ok. Nothing great although they did give me a side salad with it instead of those kettle chips that come with the sandwiches. I can't comment on the milkshakes because I would never pay 8$ for a milkshake. Sorry... The overall atmosphere was modern and the service wasn't spectacular but it is what I expected from a burger joint. I think it is overpriced but its the trendy place to go right now."}
{"text":"Their fluffer nutter butter (shakes) is the best !!!"}
{"text":"One of the best burguer places I've ever been to! Outstanding milkshakes, monster sized burguers, I couldn't finish it all. I've heard of the long lines, but I guess I was lucky enough to wait for a couple of minutes only. Pricy pricy, but portions are big."}
{"text":"The food here is so amazing! I'm not a huge fan of burgers but this restaurant totally changed my tune.  My favorites are the mortuary steakhouse burger and the meet your maker. This place is worth the wait and worth every penny and don't forget to try the Korean BBQ taco appetizer."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The only two draw backs is that there is almost always a wait during peak hours and the service can be alittle slow. Other than that the burgers are great. The create your own burger allows you to experiment with different combinations and ultimately allows the customer to never get the same thing twice. The pre-designed burgers are also good for the indecisive and the salads are also tasty. But you can't go to Burgatory without getting one of their creative shakes, but I suggest getting it to go as a treat for later."}
{"text":"This is an abnormally great burger joint. My friends and I left thoroughly impressed."}
{"text":"Our server was very nice and informative, however it looked like he was the only one working handling the whole floor himself. 

The milkshakes were awesome, but the food was just alright."}
{"text":"Those two hour wait times during dinner are now understandable. All the hype is justified. This place is delicious. 

Phat Patti's Veggie topless is GOOD. It was so full of yummy toppings that I had to use a fork and knife to eat it. The actual patty was clearly made fresh. Veggies can appreciate that! 

Lost a star because the sea salt & herb fries were disappointing. Fries are my favorite & I am not the least bit of a fry snob (Wendy's fries alllllllll day) so I was sad to find they weren't that tasty. Clearly a poor choice on my part. I'll have to try those truffle fries next time. 

WISH I could have fit a milkshake into my stomach, but it just wasn't going to happen. 

Go for an early lunch to beat those long dinner lines for a burger. Then visit again for fries and a milkshake. If you fit it all in in one sitting, you deserve an award."}
{"text":"The piggy butter and jelly burger is incredible. Get it wit elk meat. The fifty fifty is to much bacon."}
{"text":"My family has been talking up Burgatory for a long time now. It's their absolute favorite burger place out there, and me being a self described burger connoisseur, had to check it out to see what all the hype was about. Let me tell you, they weren't lying, the burgers here are pretty amazing.

The layout of the place is pretty sleek. It feels like a cross between a sports bar and a trendy upscale restaurant. There's plenty of seating all around, and they can easily accommodate larger parties (we had 12 in ours and they did a great job of serving us).

I was a little intimidated by their burger menu. Every single burger on there sounded amazing..and then on top of that they have a build your own burger option. If you choose to do that they have a pad of paper with every single option you could think of for your burger..you put your name on the paper and pick every specific thing you want..from the type of bun to the type of meat (there are meatless options too) to the type of dry rub for your burger..as well as what type of cheese, sauces, and toppings you want. 

Being a bit overwhelmed by the build your own option I decided to try one of their pre-picked specialty ones, the Morty's Steakhouse burger. This burger just sounded perfect..it was described as having a great steak dinner reincarnated as a burger.

I have to tell you..that was one tasty burger. They used Peppercorn Crusted Beef and topped it with Horseradish Cheddar cheese, onions, haystack onions, and Cabernet sauce. They weren't lying..it seriously tasted like a steak meal on a bun. It was so delicious..the combination of the steak burger with the onions and cheese and sauce was perfect. If you enjoy a good steak dinner..you're going to love this burger.

On my inevitable next round here I think I will tackle the build your own burger. I was really intrigued by their fifty-fifty beef..which is basically 50% bacon and 50% beef grinded together and formed in a patty for your burger. A couple people at the table ordered it and they all said it was amazing..I mean it sounds frickin amazing doesn't it?

Besides their burgers, Burgatory is also known for their milkshakes..and for good reason..it was probably one of the best milkshakes I have ever tasted. I went with the cookie monster shake..which is basically a chocolate chip cookie infused milkshake. It was unbelievable..the milkshake was made perfectly..thick and creamy and full of chocolate..the cookie chunks that it was infused with gave it such a wonderful cookie taste..it was honestly amazing.

So yeah..this place definitely lives up to the hype. On top of the amazing food, the service was awesome too. Our server was patient in explaining the menu to us and was extremely patient with all the small kids in our group. The food came out pretty quickly and it was all made perfectly. Prices are a bit high, but you get what you pay for..which is superb food and great service..it's well worth the price.

I would easily say it's the best overall burger chain I've been to. I can't wait to go back and try that fifty-fifty burger. Now if only they'll consider opening some locations in Cincinnati so I don't have to wait so long to have it again."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday afternoon with my wife before a concert.  The location is perfect between the ballpark and stadium downtown.  I got in line on the Yelp app.  I had 40 minutes or so to check in the app said with 20 parties ahead of me.  We arrived just after the recommended time to check in.  We were told it would be another 20 minutes for a table.  It was more like a little less than 10 minutes.  I got a phone call and text at the same time when our table was ready.  What an awesome system!!

As busy as they were we had excellent service.  The onion rings came out less than 5 minutes after we ordered them with a spicy ketchup and horseradish dip.  The horseradish dip had too much horseradish in it.  The spicy ketchup was perfect.  A little kick, but not too hot.  The onions were piping hot and were huge.  We couldn't finish them all.

After trying the spicy ketchup I decided to keep the spicy theme going.  I created a spicy burger for myself.  Hormone free beef on brioche.  Diablo dust, Honey Habanero sauce, jalapeño, onion, dill pickle, and romaine lettuce.  Cooked a perfect pink edge to edge.  Was juicy as heck and I can't say enough how hot it was!  Simply delicious.  I ordered fries and kept the leftover spicy ketchup from the onion rings.  Fries were good.  Just lukewarm.  Must have been sitting a bit before being put on my plate.

Food was really good.  Service was top notch and moved quickly.  Especially since a concert was going on less than 2 hours after we were there.  I'd go back again any time."}
{"text":"I struggle with deciding whether to give it three or four stars.  The burgers blow every other burger joint in the county, out of the water.  Hands down.  But little intricacies here and there made me raise an eyebrow on more than one occasion.  But, the burgers make up for it; so I'll go with 4 stars.

-1/4 star for pointless TVs  on the walls (I really hate the American need for constant brainwashing.  And all that was on was the ESPN sports ticker)
-1/4 star for Heinz not being the ketchup of choice in their red squirt bottles (I'm Pittsburgh born and bred bitches, I know my condiments! I almost took a whole star  for this alone, but I changed my mind after I finished my entire burger)
-1/4 star for mediocre service (I had to ask for a water refill?  And the kitchen over-cooked my burger.  I wanted pink, I got it well done.  They're lucky it still blew me away in flavor.  Plus our waitress was rarely to be seen on the floor.  Probably too busy flirting and distracting the grill cook in the kitchen ;-))
-1/4 star for uncomfortable metal chairs.

We went on a Friday night and only had to wait 45 minutes.  I didn't think this was a big deal on a summer Friday evening.  Plus, the hostesses take your cell phone # down on an iPad and call you when your table is ready.  45 minutes is enough time to mosey and walk around The Waterworks to window shop and kill time; however, most people choose to wait and hover around the front door.

Going in, the ambiance is pretty badass for a burger joint.  It makes more sense than BRGR's ambiance (sleazy bachelor pad meets grease monkey).  A LOT of design work and detail went into the space, the lighting, the menus, the table caddies, and the \"create-your-own\" burger pad; that we appreciate.  The owner definitely spent a pretty penny on a sweet branding theme.  The ironic thing about Burgatory and their \"devil\" like setting is that the majority of the clientele is *bigger*...and well, probably in a health purgatory.  There are ZERO healthy options.  ZERO.  If you're health and super food conscious - just don't go here. U won't find anything modifiable enough besides a plain piece of chicken.  

But we put in a killer workout 6 days a week to eat the way we want and this was our one day a week cheat meal.  And so glad we picked this place to do it!!!

The burgers they offer are all way more inventive than BRGR.  They're creative, they're named less offensively, and you can substitute (thank the lord!!!  We have allergies to some foods).  But truly, the way to go is to create your own masterpiece.  Tim W. Breaks it down in his review (Thanks dude) how to create it.  There are soooooooooo many options.  You could go back 100 times and try a new combination every time.   

I ordered a beef burger, on an herbed foccaccia bun, peppercorn rub, with sautéed mushrooms and onion straws (no cheese - allergic to dairy).  My boyfriend had the bison, with whole wheat bun, peppercorn rub, with sautéed mushrooms and roasted red pepper.  I got the chips, he got the rosemary and sea salt French fries.  The first thing we noticed when we picked up our burgers - THEY HAVE WEIGHT AND MASS!!!  These are dense ass burgers!!!  And, I didnt have to pull off half the bun to find my burger!! ( BRGR ). Truly, after my first bite I said, \"Ok, I have to go edit my BRGR review and take away ANOTHER star.  They shouldn't exist compared to here.\". My burger, even over-cooked, was phenomenal.  So much flavor, I didn't even need ketchup all that much (so I didn't mind too much THEN that it wasn't Heinz because I didn't NEED it).  The chips were awesome (but Buffalo Blues still wins the battle for homemade chips).  But the rosemary and sea salt French fries?  I'll go back for THOSE!!!  

In the end, this is THEE place to go if you're craving a to-die-for burger.  It helps that the sin going down my gullet is too good to even think of the horrible things that are going into my body.  We left very satisfied, very full, and already thinking about what we would order the next time. Skip BRGR, drive over the river, and indulge in Burgatory.  Worth the price and experience!!!"}
{"text":"The burgers are good but overpriced.   The novelty of building them yourself doesn't justify the cost.  I prefer other chains.  Perhaps the milkshakes are a draw, but I think your money could be better spent elsewhere for a gourmet burger."}
{"text":"After hearing all the raving about this place, figured I would try it out.  Went about 5PM on a Saturday afternoon and was told to expect a 70-90 minute wait, which was not a problem as they text you and give you a web link to check where you were in line.  We wandered the strip mall and saw us move quickly to under 10 and about a hour later, we got the \"ready\" text.

Quickly seated and ordered, the food came out, it was okay, not good, not great, but okay.  $85 for two kids meals, 4 shakes (2 adult, 2 w/o alcohol) and tip.

Good but not great food, shakes were the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"I have been to Burgatory 4 times now and while there is improvement, it is still a ways away.  The part that gets me is that the food sucks.  The menu is very creative but the execution is awful.  The steakhouse burger with the Haystack Onions came out with about 3 onions on it, hardly stacked which would have been fitting, welcome and delicious.  The Jerk Chicken burger seemed awesome with Banana Ketchup.  The ketchup was non-existent and the chicken tasted like it was rubbed in a think layer of nothing but nutmeg.  Even the accompanying chips or fries were underdone.  The Crab Shack burger which has Sriracha Remoulade tasted nothing of the flavor.  I agree with other reviewers that the menu is creative but if you don't get any of the flavors then it doesn't matter.  Service is ok, albeit I have only eaten at the bar.  The shakes are good and the beer selection being only micro brews is nice for the area.  I have been there a number of times and I for one just don't get it.  The only thing they have over BRGR is presentation.  I hate that BRGR serves the burger in a deep basket.  That's it.  The food is much better."}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday and hadn't been here in a while. I forgot how good their burgers were! My wife and I walked in at prime time and we did have a 40 minute wait, but I have to say it was worth it. My Morton's steak burger was done perfectly and the service was very fast and friendly. I will definitely not wait as long next time to come back!"}
{"text":"I figured I should try this place once while I'm still in Pittsburgh for school and honestly the burgers were just so-so. I mean it was good, but not anything spectacular and same with the chips and fries. I honestly would've rather preferred a Five Guys burger and fries instead. Our waitress was nice and attentive but the food was just sub-par. I wish I would've gotten a milkshake but I was too full from the burger. Maybe that would've made me change my mind."}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing. Shakes are even better... i would eat here everyday.  The reason it gets 4 stars is that the menu is missing sides. Yeah they have homemade chips, rosemary fries, jalapeño corn bread, and baked beans but... after a dozen meals... the chips are too bland and hard, fries are over the top and steal the show from the burger (sometimes so soggy and saturated they are inedible), cornbread is good but you better like jalapeños, beans are trying too hard.  I just want a starchy filler. Beer batter fries, less grandiose onion rings... just something to send me home stuffed and not regretting eating that... other thing that came with the burger."}
{"text":"Having been a little disappointed in our go-to burger joint near Shadyside during our last few visits, we came to the Burgatory, and it far exceeded my expectations. We started with the truffle oil and gorgonzola fries - AMAZING. I also started with the Burnt Almond Torte shake since I love Prantl's Burnt Almont Torte. This was very good as well. As my entre, I tried the Phat Patti's Vegie burger. Between the fries and the shake I was pretty full at this point so I didn't eat much, but I enjoyed what I had. As you can probably guess, the shakes are filling so if you plan to get one, come hungry or consider passing on the appetizer (although I know I will never be able to pass on the truffle fries).

My one complaint is that there was way too much whipped cream on the shake (the whipped cream took up 1/3 of the glass), but it came with a \"refill\" cup so there was still plenty of shake to drink if you could make it through the whipped cream."}
{"text":"Love that you can build your own. Good margaritas. We did the waitlist thing and they seated in ~30 min (when everyone else had to wait over an hour), but apparently this was longer than they were supposed to make us wait so they gave us free wings. Great management, good food, will be returning."}
{"text":"The staff here is rude and lazy. Went to order take out and there was no one at the door to greet people. No one at hostess stand. I waited several minutes looking around for where to go and not one staff member would acknowledge that I was standing there. They just gave dirty looks. ALL OF THEM!  I finally walked up to someone who looked like a manager and asked him if I could order some take out. Obviously annoyed he said 'yeah, I can do that.' Side note - I don't discriminate against those that have a more artsy appearance with dreads and face piercings, BUT, there is a difference between being different and looking unkempt and dirty. VERY UNAPPETIZING. My husband likes their burgers so this food was for him not me. But now I understand why he requested I go and get it while he stayed home. Complete jerks."}
{"text":"Couldn't even make it to the food. 

I tried to take my wife here on a date, but we ended up leaving before even getting served. The hostess had a number of open tables but instead placed us knee to knee with another couple we didn't know at a supposedly separate table. 

I wouldn't put up with it, we left and went elsewhere. If atmosphere is one of apathy and not caring about the customer the food isn't even worth trying."}
{"text":"It's good.

They have a variety of AMAZING combination burgers, or create your own patties, buns and INCREDIBLE toppings to choose from. The better toppings the higher the price...EACH, which is to be expected I suppose, but if you want all of what you want, after u see the amazing selection of options...you WILL enjoy it. You will leave satisfied, but maybe with the thought...\"Wow, I could have bought a ____________ instead!\", depending on what you ordered and how many you are treating. 

I like that they have a veggie patty for my vegan little one, and myself as I am struggling to maintain a \"vegan as possible\" lifestyle. 

The service was less than to be desired on 2 of 3 occasions. The one time I went, the one waitress had an attitude and rolled her eyes at us because my friend (an older fella) who really didn't understand how to verbalize his order. He said \"a plain hamburger\" she translated that as a \"standard deluxe\" which has basic fixins and cheese. After that service was avoidant and abrupt with looks and body language that could kill. The scary thing was...she was training. 

Less irritating but notable, the next time we went, despite all the tables and booths open...the hostess seated us immediately next to, and on the same bench as another couple. Me and my daughter was didn't want to seem rude, stuck up, or had something against the couple they sat us with, but why crowd us, AND THEM when there's so much open seating (including two-seaters)? We didn't say anything and just sat where assigned, barely a handbag length next to the other couple, and I can tell by the way they scooted over and looked at the hostess, AND around the room...that they also felt unnecessarily crowded and a bit awkward...So there were 2 of 3 visits where there was something \"not so great\" regarding the service. If I could subtract just one of those experiences...I would DEFINITELY give it at least another star. 

Now, the waiters have always seemed naturally friendly and accommodating without ever leaving us any reason to contemplate speaking up about something...as though they actually cared that their customers had a good experience.

I would go back for the food and atmosphere, with my guard up and expectations related to service somewhat low."}
{"text":"Was told there was a 5-10 minute wait and the host took my name. I then proceeded to watch him immediately seat another party of 2 and another party of 3 less than 30 seconds after taking my name that walked in the door after I did. Ummm?"}
{"text":"You just can't do any better for burgers. I like to make my own and I am never disappointed. Their chips, salads and milkshakes are all great as well."}
{"text":"Shakes from heaven (The S'mores or Salted Caramel will ruin you for shakes anywhere else).  Sinfully indulgent burgers and apps.  Creativity and wit in every line on the menu, and genius in every bite.  It's hard not to make my review sound like an advertisement, but they really are that good.  

Not only does Burgatory have tons of signature burgers that taste divine, you can \"Have it your way\" and they'll custom assemble any combo you can dream up.  The prices are fair for gourmet burgers and shakes.  I particularly recommend any of the signature house fries, the Onion Rings, and the  \"Bangkok Fries\": massive juicy portabello mushroom strips, beer battered, and brought out stacked in a log cabin with a spicy dipping sauce.

My only complaint is it's so good, that despite the ample seating, there tends to be a wait.  Expect 20-40 minutes on a normal day, up to as much as 3 hours on a busy Saturday night.  Given how many other restaurants are within a few hundred feet, it's very telling that people will wait here for over an hour, rather than eat somewhere else.  That's what happens when you offer delicious, innovative food, with good service, and fair prices.  I hope more other restaurant owners take note and follow Burgatory's lead!"}
{"text":"I ate here the day after Brgr which is Pittsburgh's other premier gourmet burger shop so I feel qualified to compare them both fairly.  The combinations of both meals probably took years off my life so I hope you appreciate the sacrifice I've made to finally settle the question, where is Pittsburgh's best burger?  The definitive answer is without question, burgatory!  It's food at burgatory is more creative, more freestyle, more flavorful, less greasy and just more fun!  All the quasi religion of burger branding is amusing and well thought out, the staff was extremely friendly, and you can choose from their amazing premade burgers, or assemble you're own from a virtually endless list of toppings.  All this is a nice contrast to Brgr which only offers a few premade burgers, and allows no customization or substitutions, all while charging a higher price tag for smaller portions.  I got the snookie italian burger with a PB&J shake, both were sinfully delicious, but surprisingly non-greasy.  Both their alcoholic and non-alcoholic shakes are truly creative and incredibly good.  For non-carnivores there are many vegetarian and fish burgers as well.  I love the style and attitude here, and they really give you a chance to have it your way!"}
{"text":"The whole experience was a treat. The burgers were out of this world. The shakes were something I'd come back for if they only had those one the menu. I was told to go by many friends and family in the area for the past few years and wish I had tried it earlier. I had the venison special and my girlfriend had the bison special. Both were insane."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. From the food to the service, it's a great spot to grab a bite and relax after work. To order your burger, you fill out a piece of paper and customize every aspect of your meal. Meat, sauce, bun, toppings... your pick! From elk meat to kobe beef, this place has very interesting selections."}
{"text":"This is going to come as a shock, but Burgatory is a great place for vegans! What a pleasant surprise to discover not only do they have two everyday vegan burger options, but also every Tuesday is Vegan Day where they feature yet another vegan option AND a vegan milkshake! Yah! Bonus: they even offer vegan cheese and mayo.

Our server was so attentive and sensitive to vegan dietary needs, and informed me that their chips and fries are fried with the same grease as the burgers, so I should avoid those. I enjoyed the side salad with a zesty apple cider vinaigrette instead, and I was happy to do so.

I know this location is going to get BUSY during home sporting events, as there is a serious lack of good food options on the North Shore. I plan to head there often for Vegan Tuesday!"}
{"text":"The name alone piqued our interest.  But burgers are her favorite, not mine.  So she sent me to read the menu with the admonishment if I didn't find something I adsolutely had to try, we were going to Panera.  So I poured over the menu starting with shakes.  I was interested in the Salted Carmel Pretzel shake, but was worried about the ensuing diabetic coma.  Great service and excellent food.  I actually felt healthy!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in Pittsburgh, hands down...but you all know that already!  If you go and there is a wait, don't fret, you can always go shopping since it is in a strip mall or you can chill by the magazine racks in Barnes & Noble so the time goes by fast!  I have been multiple times and have had the campfire milkshake as well as the crunchy pretzel.  Both are phenomenal.  If you have a chance to go to Burgatory to not pass it up!"}
{"text":"I don't know. For a place named after a burger I feel like their burgers are lacking. It was good but it was expensive for what you received. And the burgers were not cooked as we asked. Our server was less than pleased to have us sitting in front of her. It didn't live up to its name for us. It was not bad but it was not noteworthy either."}
{"text":"#1 burger #1 milkshake #1 salad from a burger restaurant and dead last in being able to get a table quickly.

Normally you could not pay me to eat at a restaurant in a strip mall, but this place is worth driving for. The strip mall almost is needed though because the wait to get a table is almost always 30 minutes plus (I have experienced 60+). 

I wish I had two stomachs so I could actually finish a burger in a shake.

 Always a long wait, always loud, and always awesome!"}
{"text":"Fabulous burgers and hard shakes. Love the poutine appetizer too! Service is fast and friendly, and portions are generous. Always on our Pgh \"to do\" list whenever we visit IKEA. They also use the \"No Wait\" app which makes seating super easy and flexible. Plenty of TVs around so you won't miss the game and a variety of seating options are available. 

This place can be a little challenging to find since it's kind of out of the way amongst a VERY BUSY retail area (Robbins Crossing), but it's well worth searching out. Prices are reasonable, about what you'd pay at Applebee's, Ruby Tuesday's, etc."}
{"text":"My first trip to Burgatory has definitely left me wanting to return, and soon! The service was great, the atmosphere is busy and upbeat, and the menu selections are fantastic. Plenty of options for any type of burger you can think of. They have a menu of prepared burgers or you can build your own monster. I chose the Buffalo Bison burger, and it was absolutely delicious. The meat had great flavor, the buffalo gave it a nice little kick while a little ranch cooled it back down, the veggie toppings were fresh, and the sweet potato chips were a great side. Interested in trying out the Elk burger next time!"}
{"text":"So after reading the reviews, I was ready to be blown off my seat. That did not happen with the burger(s) sadly.

They made us wait 2 hours, thinking it might be shorter time we gave it a chance. The staff is not friendly add they don't even have the Decency to give out snacks while you wait. With a pregnant wife and a 2 year old we waited because we wanted to have these amazing burgers yelp recommended. Yeh their average at the best.

2 hrs later when out seats were finally available we were seated. Our friends ordered the shakes before the burgers. I didn't because I wanted to eat the burger. In hindsight I should have orders the shake instead. The shakes have actual chunks in it. I tasted the shakes and they were nothing like I have had before... So the place should be called shakatory.

When the burgers finally arrived, they lacked flavor and substance. Mildly juicy. Again the standard was the 4 stars. Unfortunately the burgers disappointed. At least the meat burgers. Te chips sucked really bad. Don't be shamed into tying the fries it the chips.

If you want VEGE burger though... That's another story. The best place for a vege burger period.

Long story short for a meat burger place it's a flop. Try a 5 guys instead."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great burgers and the milkshakes are unreal.  In my opinion the milkshakes are where this place shines.  They are full of all kinds of crazy ingredients and are some wild recipes.  I especially enjoy the burnt almond torte milkshake.  It's made with burnt almond torte from Prantl's, amaretto, and ice cream.  So good!  We tried this at home but it wasn't quite the same."}
{"text":"Got a cracked peppercorn rubbed burger with egg and bacon and horseradish sauce. The rub was phenomenal, really enhanced the burger. Both the horseradish and horseradish cheese was delicious as well. The chips that came with the burger were not good at all, I stopped eating after a few of them. Milkshake, like usual, was delicious as well, but a little pricey ($6!). Would've gotten a five star if the food came out faster, but it was during the dinner rush so I understand. Great place to go before Pirate or Steeler games, within walking distance of both!!"}
{"text":"I came for lunch and it was busy but we got seated right away. There's ample seating indoors and out, but we sat inside in a little side booth. I ordered a Create Your Own burger; there are tons of meat and topping choices. The burger was very good. I got the garlic aioli and it tasted great but I wish there was little bit more of it on the burger. I got a beef burger and it was huge, normally I don't like thick burgers but this one had great flavor and was cooked well (no pun intended) throughout, so I didn't mind. I also upgraded to fries as a side, normally it comes with chips.

I also got the Caramel Pretzel milkshake and it was decent. I was really excited to try the milkshakes after reading so many great reviews, and while this one had good flavor it was a bit too thick and had too much pretzel. Way too many pretzels ground up in there for my taste.

This was a pretty good lunch spot. The burgers were great and the milkshake was decent. Service was fast and friendly and the ambiance was nice, too. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"If you love meat, get the wagyu burger. Great chips not fries salt caramel shake is so thick that you couldn't even drink it with a straw"}
{"text":"Such a wide variety of choices.  Extremely juicy burger.  Great taste.  Did I mention the endless variety of burger combinations?  All kinds of game meat and chicken."}
{"text":"Specifically asked NOT to be seated near th plastic wall (ridiculous in its very existence in a city that gets to single digits by the way, genuises) we said we would wait longer than the reasonable wait time if necessary.  They seated us in the corner of 2 windows... gf wouldn't let me go off the totally clueless totally typical mellineal that couldn't tear his eyes off his phone long enough to understand a request, so I sat through dinner listening to her complain... this is the SECOND TIME (and last) we have had issues at this location.  Last time we asked NOT to be seated in the reception/ watching people eat/ human zoo area and we were told that if we refused the table we would get put at the end of the waiting list... I didn't want to come back and this has just validated everything I thought about  this place the last time.  Done."}
{"text":"Came here with friends. I should've physically prepped myself before going. Dear God it was delicious. The milkshake was delightful,  I had the Carmel pretzel one. .. then I built my own burger... got 3 bites in before getting it wrapped to take home. 
Really great place. Big thumbs up."}
{"text":"Hearing how great this place was (My guy LOVES it!)  a friend and I gave  it a shot. We were welcomed  with a very nice Hostess and seated right away ( it was an early lunch)  Our waitress was friendlily and informative, but the food was another thing.. we both ordered burgers I choose to build mine and m friend choose off the menu. They were both cooked to perfection, but the bourbon bbq sauce was spicy, the size was small and was lost among the toppings, let, onion, pickle. ( I chose to have mine naked, always a good choice for me.) Hers on the other hand looked very tasty and she agreed, the fried onions were a hit!  We both agreed the baked beans were spicy and had an odd vinegar taste, along with the slaw. The fries were tasty though.  Guess the next time if we chance it I understand that Wagu beef is the best.  In the end the bill was $29.50 for 2 burgers,1 f/f , coleslaw  and baked beans. ( Thank god we decided to share ! )     Over all, can't say I'm impressed :("}
{"text":"Could have been better. The shakes are good, but the burger was a disappointment for the price."}
{"text":"I love Burgatory and this one is in my backyard so it makes it even more special. Some people like to hate on Burgatory, mostly people who work or frequent BRGR, but I love it. Something that no one can debate is they this place has it together. They know what they do and they to themselves very good. The whole heaven and hell thing the rustic decor, all they way to the square business cards and funky fortune cookie at the end of the meal. 

I know that this particular one has had some issues with speed but I think they are still feeling things out. I give them the benefit out the doubt. All the waiters/waitresses that I have had my several trips to this particular location have been very nice and talkative as I'm sure they are encouraged to do.

Don't forget to get in line on NoWait (iPhone App) so that you don't have to wait as long get a table. Also get your shake with your food so that you don't put that heavy shake in before your put a heavy burger. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"I'm with Chuck W. when he said \"What can I say that hasn't been said. Outstanding burgers, should be enough to say.\"

People talk about this place, and what else is there to say about it really. They have really good burgers and even though it's becoming the \"it\" thing to do they have spiked shakes. 

The difference between this place and other places that have burgers is that Burgatory does is right. Everything they do seems to have a purpose a place on their menu. They don't do things just for the sake of doing them or having them on the menu.

Their spiked shakes are awesome and the execution is really cool as well. The S'more shake has a giant toasted marshmallow on top, and likewise the Oreo shake has the biggest Oreo I have ever seen placed right on top. 

Everything about their decor is right on point. If I had a cool burger joint this is exactly how I would have decorated it. I love everything about this place other than the sometimes long waits to get a table."}
{"text":"The absolute best burger ever. Service is always great and the shakes are amazing. My fave is the Piggy Butter & Jelly. Of course it's way better than it sounds. Try it! The butter Butter shake is pretty awesome too."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way home from Pittsburgh yesterday. I created a Fiddy Fiddy burger (half beef half bacon) my fiancee had the Morty's burger. The choices on the build your own seem endless. The garlic mayo is awesome. Both burgers were spectacular, cooked perfectly, and so filling. The hard shakes rock too!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much.  There's something appealing about filling out the little checklist and adding anything you want to your burger.  The meat choices are the best I've ever seen.  The wagyu beef is delicious and tender.  There are also tons of bun, sauce, and cheese choices.  They also have an amazing black bean patty.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"A great idea for unique original burger combos and recipes that you can create.  With plenty of menu choices that were delicious this place also has some of the best milkshakes I've tried. Highly recommended on all levels."}
{"text":"first let me start off by saying it is refreshing to think that a burger is not just a burger anymore.  Burgatory really puts the pow in an American staple.  my lovely wife and 5 young ladies and I went to the Burgatory down at the waterfront for lunch.  we were able to right in and the atmosphere and great.  even though it was winter we were in the patio section and it was quite toasty.  Our Serve was just wonderful Liz W was friendly and informative.  She answered all of our question and quite encouraging when it came to suggestions.  

The girls all built there own burgers but stayed with the standard burger.  Every single person loved there meal.  I on the other hand, felt that is was my duty to try something new and different.  I like elk so I tried the Elk Gone Wild Burger.  Let me say it didn't disappoint.  First it had a Grass Fed Elk Burger with the Diablo Dust.  Topped with caramelized onion and bacon jam with a think slice smoked gouda.  With a vinaigrette tossed arugula.   The first bit surprised me.  The diablo dust did its trick.  along with the meaty taste of the Elk there was a punch of spice that filled my mouth.  the combination really when well together.  The unctuousness  of the meat and spice was mellowed by the smoked gouda.

Along with the Burger I had to have the Apple Pancake and Bacon Milkshake.  Yes I said apple pancake and bacon.  It was wonderful, you wouldn't expect to have chunks of bacon in a milkshake and it blend well with Ice-cream and milk,  let me tell you it really does.  You can get this wacky combination in a hard version but being that it was a lunch and i had 4 hours of driving to do i stayed with the non-alcoholic version.  I would highly recommend you try this restaurant, you will be surprised to find a burger is no long just a burger anymore,"}
{"text":"seriously awesome burger!!!! it was cooked perfectly!!!! soooooo good!!! and our server alex was great!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our waiter forgot our order of nachos until we reminded him. 
Wife's fries were burnt, my \"seasoned\" fries had exactly two pieces of visible seasoning and otherwise were normal regular fries."}
{"text":"Very good food and service!  Good beer selection with many local breweries. Fast, knowable, and efficient service."}
{"text":"A very good burger joint located in the Waterworks.  Similar in style to BRGR in East Liberty, though with a few things a bit different.  You have a wide ranger of pre-designed burgers that you can choose from, however what I have always found to be enjoyable is the build-your-own burger option.  You get to choose everything from the type of meat they use to the rub they put on it, the type of bun and all the toppings.  You could easily spend a large portion of your visit here just trying to come up with different burger choices.  If you are someone who does not like that much freedom or choice, I would suggest sticking with their pre-designed burger menu.

Another option they have is milkshakes - both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.  They come in a variety of flavors and all of the ones that I have tried have been stellar.

They do also offer choices for the non-meat eaters in your group.  Veggie burgers are on the menu, as are a number of fish choices.  

So far, the only disappointment I have had with the menu is that I get too full too quickly, and don't always have the opportunity to try everything I wish to eat."}
{"text":"My fiancee had a Burnt Almond Torte $9 and I had the Choco Taco shake $9.  Both of them were great but neither of us finished them because they were just too much sugar.  She ordered the Crab Shack $12.50 with Deviled Egg Potato Salad $3.  The sandwich was delicious she said but the chips were over-cooked and the potato salad was not what she anticipated.  She was hoping for a traditional deviled egg type of potato salad.  I had a dry aged wagyu burger $16 with applewood smoked bacon, truffle aioli, and horseradish cheddar with a side of fries.  I can easily say it was one of the best burgers I have had in a long time.  The flavor combination was great.  We will definitely be going back.  Total bill was $53.50."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that most eateries don't rub me the wrong way like this.  I'm fairly pleased, if not happy, with the myriad of establishments that I try.

However, I must be the only person in the world who isn't a gushing fanboy for this completely overrated-ripoff of a burger joint, even though cleverly-named.  My wallet and stomach thought I was all the way down in Hell.  

I'd been to the Waterworks location a few times, if that, and was disappointed at what you got for the price.  Sure, the quality is there, but not the size.  Yes, portion isn't everything, but for their prices, it should be a big factor.  Sure, \"big\" was a pun, why not.  Anyway,  I've been to numerous places that have had as good, if not better, of burger quality and size for the money.  Nox Grille, in Blawnox, just overall wipes the floor with Burgatory.  Beer Nutz kicked their butts, too.  Beer Nutz was supposedly owned by Burgatory, but now are closed.  Beer Nutz had great portions, quality, and prices.  Coincidence?  Ya think you pay a ton for the flashy atmosphere at Trendytory?  \"Oh, Burgatory is soooooo awesome...all my friends go there!\"  Ooooh, tell me more!

I didn't care to visit the obnoxiously-loud establishment again, on my own at least.  A few of my friends invited me out the other night, and I hadn't seen one in forever, so I figured \"Why not, my buds are out.\"  I was trying to imagine that this time would be better, or just different, but nope, it was worse (worst ever, actually).  I saw all of the burger prices, and thought, for the bun being considerably bigger than the burger (last two times and looking around at other plates), I thought \"Ummm, no.\"  I got one of their salads...yes, at a gourmet burger place, because at least the salad prices seemed comparable to other places that give you monster ones, so I was...hopeful?  Wrong again.  The salad wasn't small, but very average-sized for an entree.  Bravo kicks their butt in this area.  (Seeing a pattern here yet?)  The beer prices were also stupid, as the cheapest one was $6.  I can name a ton of other places that have better prices across the board.  Burgatory's selection was paltry, too, at best.  Somehow, no one else, including my friends, seem to care about spending a tank of gas and then some, on dinner for themselves when it's nothing worth it.  Hey, you can do more with gas anyway, including lighting your ripoff dinner on fire...at least that'd be enjoyable.      

So, you can imagine how overpriced my dinner was (naw really?).  Again, I don't get the hype here.  Not only was the wait time almost TWO HOURS (this is supposedly normal on a busy night, but who gives a s**t, strike one).  Then this place just kept striking out like a batter with chicken wings for arms.  Crap, I should've eaten wings.  My friends and I were there for a while hanging out, and that was of course a good experience, unlike the restaurant for me (I held in the angst).  Then...wait for it...my check, after tip (I still tip well for decent service) came to around $30.

$30 for a salad and two beers.

Burgatory SUCKS."}
{"text":"I had been craving a good burger for a few days and decided to give this place a try. Let me say you will not be disappointed. I chose to create my own burger because deciding between the 8-10 different burgers on the menu was just too difficult. My burger came out perfectly as well as my boyfriends. I would highly recommend giving this place a try. 

Service was amazing as well although it was 3:00 pm on a Tuesday so it is a pretty slow time in the restaurant industry. Our server, Conor B, was knowledgeable on the menu and very helpful with the tough choices if I must say so myself. He also put up with my indecisiveness without showing signs of annoyance which I also loved. 

I will definitely be stopping by again."}
{"text":"I've had bison many times. It's one of my favorite meats. Very few places know how to make it. When I took the first bite of my burger, I could tell immediately that it was fresh, not frozen. I confirmed with the manager that they grind their own meat on the premises. Let's get one thing clear. I AM A CARNIVORE. I love meat. As I said before I've had bison many times. The burgatory bison burger was the best bison burger I've ever had. I didnt fancy it up, just had the garlic/salt/pepper mix on it, no need to get really fancy. With good meat, you don't need to camouflage it. 
ON TO THE TAKEOUT. I tried the burger that comes with pot roast on it (forget the name, but not the taste). It was also one of the best burgers I've ever had. 
Quasi-CON: The prices may be considered a little steep by some, but in all fairness, I think it's well worth it. Great service, AWESOME MEAT! and you can build your own burger."}
{"text":"Happy hour with half priced apps and drink specials was a nice welcome to the evening. Service and service staff were fantastic!  Very welcoming, attentive and helpful throughout the entire evening. 

Onion ring appetizer came quickly, but was dark, dry and overcooked. The sauces were spicy and were tasty, but there was no recovery for the over cooked rings. Oh well, it's happy hour. No big deal!  

The \"Get Shorty\" arrived and instead of the succulent, juicy, drippy, horseradish spiced dish enjoyed in the past, its blah. Bland. Dry. Goopy, tasteless gravy/au jus. So disappointing. 

Again, staff was wonderful, attentive and accommodating. Just wish the food was as good as the staff."}
{"text":"Bad doesn't begin to describe dinner tonight. Our party of 11 arrived at 4:30. I'm writing my review at 7:06 and am just leaving. We made it very clear that we had tickets for a concert including a meet and greet before the show and needed to leave at 6:15. That's all we said. We didn't elaborate- 

To sum up the experience. I'm hungry. Most of my group left because they went to see the meet and greet because my cousins the concert headliner. My meal was taken from me by someone clearing the table mid bite as I stayed behind and tried to eat. Missed the meet and greet-  and was charged for items we shouldn't have been. Not a good experience at Burgatory.

To add to just how terrible today was- it was a very special event. My cousin is a well know performer. He travels as a musician and is on the hit tv show, Nashville. Tonight we chose Burgatory to celebrate with before his concert. It was also my mothers birthday and another cousin in law just had a double mastectomy and ended chemo. We had a lot to be joyful about. 

Burgatory pretty much crapped all over our joy and couldn't have cared less about our frustration with their lack of professionalism. Hey at least they consistent in their indifference in who you are. 

I really can't express how pathetic the meal was tonight. I felt so bad for our server as she scrambled while our meals never arrived. 30 minutes after ordering about 3/5 of our food arrived. And the rest didn't come for another 20-25 more minutes. 

As for food---  
Having been to Burgatory many times before, and being the one who told me family it would be great, I ordered an item I've had multiple times previously. In the past I enjoyed a milkshake made with housemate vanilla ice cream, coffee beans, espresso, and chocolate. What I was served tonight was NASTY. Flavor wasn't existent. After a sip I asked the waitress to return the inedible item. I was told managements approval would be needed. To sum it up- I paid $9+ for a milkshake that tasted like paint varnish and wasn't consumed. If I had known my meal wouldn't arrive in a timely manner and then be cleared mid bite then I would have kept that milkshake since I had purchased it. I would have it so I wouldn't have been so hungry later. 

My actual burger. I ordered a $15+ ground chicken burger. Which I would have enjoyed --except it arrived when the bill was being paid @ 6:40. Most of the party gave up on eating since they had to be elsewhere way before 6:40.. I was famished along with my 19 month old. Yes our Toddler was patient the entire disaster of a meal. We tried to stay to eat after the rest of the family had to rush to the show.  Well mid- bite, since most of our table left, the manager came over and cleared the remaining baskets. Including the one containing the burger I was in the middle of eating!  I was chewing. I looked down and my burger was swiped away!!! Bizarre!!!! 

So to sum it up. My famous cousin came to his hometown and Burgatory crapped all over our big family night out before his concert. I think tonight will live in meals out that were the worst ever for as long time. Congratulations Burgatory for going above and beyond at being shockingly terrible! Wow. Just WOW!


*** I didn't describe the burger due to the lack of consumption.  I did eat a lot of fries. Salty."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype is about.  After two failed attempts at getting a table in the past, we finally managed to secure a table so I could could try this long-awaited and much talked about burger.  Before fire rains down upon me for posting a poor review from the Burgatory fanboys/fangirls...I'm not saying the food was bad.  I'm saying it didn't live up to the ridiculous amount of hype I've heard about it from friends, nor does it jusitfy waiting 1+ hrs. for a table.

They were packed.  The service was Meh.  The waitress was clearly super busy and they were understaffed, totally slammed, or both.  I got a burger and a shake. I got the \"Meat your Maker\" which was less than impressive.  Sure, it sounded like it would be great but it just wasn't the taste-bomb my mouth was expecting. My wife got some pot roasty burger thing that was better than my burger, but again, disappointed me. 

Perhaps my expectations were set too high.  I'd take 5 guys over this any day.  I'd take Red Robin over this any day.  I will give you this, Burgatory...you make a damn fine milkshake."}
