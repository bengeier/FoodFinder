{"text":"I really owe this place 20 more great reviews because we go there all the time and I've never been disappointed.  The fish is always fresh and Johnny will create a roll for you if you can't find one on the menu you like.
The staff is like family and very friendly.
This is still my favorite place!!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in Las Vegas. We always sit at the bar and Eric, James and ken take great care of us. If you are nice enough James might even give you some of his fresh wasabi. 
We always get a sashimi plate, a fish or two on special and a roll. The fish is very fresh and is always cut great. The jonny roll, designed by the owner, is really good. 
The atmosphere is great at the sushi bar. We always end up talking to the people siting by us and have a great time. If you like sushi, you need to come to momos!"}
{"text":"This placebos going down hill. Not sure if a change of ownership but was pretty much told I need to give a 5 star rating to redeem my Yelp free dessert.  Not going back for sure."}
{"text":"I was extremely hungry, but not to the point I would eat something that isn't fresh. The rice was hard and  color of the albacore was questionable. I ate two pieces and I think I'm nauseous?!! Even the tempura appetizers were gooey and doughy. Money wasted"}
{"text":"Have been several times and every time it delivers the goods.  My wife and I love every visit as we have a long list of favorites we now order.  Highly recommend to any sushi lovers out there. Great food at a great price"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The place is very dark and dirty. A huge cockroach was crawling on our table. The fish wasn't fresh. Seafood salad was way too salty. I hope I won't get sick after visiting this place! The service is pretty slow, even though it wasn't busy. Our tea was never refilled."}
{"text":"I've been dining at Momo Sushi for over 4 years and I will continue to come back.

I find the Momo Hamachi and the Irish Roll to be absolutely delicious! 

The wait staff is always pleasant and the chefs are comical and friendly.

The decor needs to be updated and the excess flyers hanging all over the place needs to be removed, its an eye sore."}
{"text":"i have been going to momo sushi for years!! the staff is always friendly, the owner julie is great, and i have literally not found anything on the menu i didnt like. sooooo good. it's mouthwatering delicious!!:-)"}
{"text":"So when I walked into this place they were jammed packed with two servers on the floor. Andrew realized we did not even have our drinks and we had been there for a good 10 minutes. He promptly came to our table and offered a booth. We took that offer. Not only was the food on point but the service was even better ! Thanks Andrew I'm so full and satisfied.. the desert was the topper. See y'all soon!"}
{"text":"I really like Momo. I usually have to cross town to get good sushi but I'm so glad I found a place close to home that is really good. There is a plentiful menu and the chefs make everything look really beautiful. The prices are reasonable, especially for sushi and there's always sports on the TVs. I'm becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"Awesome! I live in southern California and eat sushi at the the most 5 star places. This is right up there without the price tag and double the portions. I am a sashimi junkie. I'm pretty sure they are flying the stuff in from LA on a share with another restaurant . in other words it was alive yesterday for certain. They even have hotegai and mirugui. The rolls are ridiculously amazing and huge. I was in awe...I am coming back in august for my birthday dinner. This place puts any so cal sushi roll place out in the cold. It rules. PS service was awesome and unlike most so cal spots, people who work here are japanese !!!! Thank you thank you! I would eat here everyday if I could. Go and go here!! Yes yes yea!"}
{"text":"Sashimi and sushi aren't fresh and they're heavily salted (assuming that's how they're preserving their fish)."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere- very welcoming. Sit at the bar and watch them create delectable little bites. Try the yellow tail sashimi. Very lite, fresh and clean and the sauce is hot and sweet."}
{"text":"Went there not expecting much as it was out first try at sushi in Henderson and we got a pleasant surprise.  The staff is very friendly and the food is good.  I am a HUGE fan of sushi and this place seems fresh to me, not to mention they have a huge list of Specialty rolls that i suggest trying.  Or you can sit at the sushi bar and tell them exactly what you want and they'll whip it up.  We've been back 3 times and it's been good every time, except one time they forgot a roll (a group of 6, so maybe smaller groups are better).  Very good, I always get a Tall Sapporo or Kirin Ichiban with my meal too, great beer.  

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Went for New Years Eve for the first time and it was delicious. Sushi was fresh and a good price. The decor could use a little freshening up, the booth I sat in was ripped ."}
{"text":"Ive been going here since high school (2006) and quality of fish and service has not gone down. Yelp didnt exist back then but i would have rated them the same as i am doing so now. They have incredible rolls and food quality is second to none! Highly recommended for sushi !"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Vegas!! Highly recommend the Irish roll and the somethings wrong 69!! Jenny is the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite spot to eat! The lunch specials are awesome and the Momo box is my favorite. Servers are super nice too! We've been coming here for years now."}
{"text":"Are you kidding...best sushi hands down. My family and I have been going here for 12 years! Both my boys request this restaurant for \"birthday dinner\" and any chance they can!!!!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Vegas and stumbled upon this place.  The udan noodle soup was full of goodies including egg, tofu, vegies and two tempura shrimp.  The sushi was fresh and everything had a great taste to it.  Would recommend this restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"First time here and was well pleased with the service. Andrew and Megan were quick to answer questions I had on some of the sushi rolls. Kiss of Fire was delicious. The plum ice cream was very tasty as well. I would come again."}
{"text":"Haven't been in a couple of years and it's still on the top of the list!  Went last night and had the most amazing new roll. . Something wrong 69. Of course right after a screaming oo. Left the last roll up to the sushi chef and he was right on point. Just as Delicious as I always remembered!"}
{"text":"Our first time trying this new restaurant in BC -- wonderful!  Everything was fresh and flavorful.  We had the sushi dinner with a sampler of sashimi and the ultimate tuna roll, shrimp tempura udon, and salmon teriyaki.  Excellent!  The staff was friendly and helpful.  We sat outside and enjoyed the evening on the quiet plaza.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Impressive ambience and food! The only thing bothered me was the club music they were playing but the food and service was excellent! Check it out."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant.  There are some unique menu items that I have not seen at other establishments.  In fact, when I was there we ordered a roll that used noodles instead of rice, and it was yummy.  There are whiteboards behind the bar with tons of daily specials.  It is conveniently located near many stores, so you can work up an appetite shopping, then stop in for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"not to bad, the food and sushi were alright. im not much for japanese but i did like this place."}
{"text":"Momo, was recommended to us for lunch by a local girl, working at our doctors office. 
My wife and I had an excellent meal there.
Crispy Eel Roll, Lobster Roll, and numerous Nigiri, including Cajun Tuna Belly. All the fish was great! James our Sushi Master, made up a couple special plates, great guy, great staff!
It was post lunch rush and so it was a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went here for Dinner, yesterday. I ordered simple things. Salmon and Albacore Nigiri and a Eel Roll.
This should have been an easy one.
The waiters were pleasant. The only redeeming quality
Well, I first got the Salmon. It was dry and slightly Chewy. Then came the Albacore. Or should I say, partially seared, Albacore. For some reasonm they decide to sear it, without making it clear, on the menu. Otherwise I wouldn't have ordered it. The thing I love about Albacore, is the melt in your mouth texture. This was Crap! I couldn't eat my order,
This presentation of Sushi destroyed my desire for Sushi, for a couple months.
I will not return here, as there are better places, not far.
They should be ashamed."}
{"text":"Ever time I go to Vegas..I just got to go to Momo Sushi restaurant. From the moment you walk in..till you leave..you are treated with the utmost hospitality. The food there is awesome..don't pass this place up..you'll definitely miss out a special place."}
{"text":"Grateful to get a REAL sushi restaurant/chef in Boulder City!  Delicious...if you're a local or passing through Boulder you will not be disappointed.  I've had sushi  on the coast in many locations...this is prepared very well."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in the Las Vegas/Henderson area. The California roll is delicious. I don't eat sashimi, so I can't be a judge of that, but the other food I have had there is consistently delicious. I love the Momo Box and have it almost every time I come here."}
{"text":"Momo sushi...thank you for introducing me to the bento boxes.  Can't get a better deal than that!

I love this place.  I lived way across town.  But when I do get the craving, no doubt I pay my homage to you."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. I come at least once a month for my sushi fix. Everything is always so delicious!"}
{"text":"Momo's is amazing! Great food and atmosphere! I've been a loyal diner since they opened. The soft shell crab wrapped in hamachi is glorious!"}
{"text":"The sushi was great, and I really appreciated my waitress letting me sit for over an hour as I worked on a project. They were very kind and explained the different dishes to me. I was even able to try one or 2 since I had never ventured away from my usual dishes."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for sushi. Always fresh and always a great experience. The only problem is, I live too far away to be here everyday! I love the MoMo Hamachi. It is a must for me. It melts in your mouth. The service is good and the food is great. What else could you want?"}
{"text":"We love Momo Sushi!  Food is fantastic and the server, Taylor, is fantastic!  So glad we have a really good sushi restaurant in Boulder City!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure !! All the staff are friendly & very accommodating.  Have back been several times & never disappointed highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"Momo sushi provided me with the best sushi i've ever tasted..The rolls were delicious, fresh,bright,flavorful and imaginative...OMG..The sashimi were so tender it melted in my mouth..It was excellent!!!I've never been disappointed by a visit here..I was also pleased with the service...We highly recommended this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, beer, saki and service on all accounts. Accommodating a solid penchant for sushi in Calgary isn't easy however they come as close to mark as I've seen. Huzzah."}
{"text":"We've been to Momoyama's multiple times, but really only because it's close to home. We're all sushi/Japanese food fanatics, and to us they are pretty mediocre. The nigiri style sushi is just ok...not amazingly fresh by any means. They do have a few cool rolls to try, and that really is their only strength. The miso soup is always weak, as is the service. I can't really recommend this place, as Vegas is chalk full of better places to get your raw fish on. However, if you find yourself in the area and hungry for sushi, go ahead and stop here. It'll be \"ok\"."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant last night.  I liked the atmosphere and friendly service.  Unfortunately, our server didn't know the ingredients in most of the Specialty Rolls and the menu does not provide a list of the ingredients or photos.  This made ordering dinner difficult.  Our server did ask and come back with an answer but I couldn't really understand her so in the end I ordered my usual - Rainbow Roll, Tempura Roll and an appetizer Tempura (2 Shrimp, and 3 vegetables).  Tempura was fluffy and crispy.  The rolls were a good size although it was not cut evenly and the rice was a little too wet - you can tell when the rolls are stuck to the plate.  It was not outstanding by any means.  Presentation of the food was nice and I felt the prices were very reasonable.  I would not return to this estabilishment.  When I want sushi - it needs to be exceptional because it's usually not cheap."}
{"text":"Fresh, Fresh, Fresh. Some of the best tasting Sushi I've ever had. I've been going there for years. 

Johnny, the owner, is an excellent host. Share some Sake with the chef, they love to have fun too ! I can't complain about the 2-4-1 house Sake they are offering now.

Friday nights are packed. The Tuna Karai is excellent."}
{"text":"We are very biased because my family absolutely loves sushi just about any kind of sushi we love it all and this place fit the bill staff was very kind and friendly and made some special little things for the kids."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Great value. Really quick service.
Wish the menu had more description though"}
{"text":"This is EASILY my favorite sushi place in town. I've been to most but if you're looking for amazing food, great people and a really fun time then this is the place for you. 

The weekend specials (fresh LIVE shrimp, blue fin toro, etc..) are definitely what set this place apart from the rest."}
{"text":"\"My favorite place for fresh sushi! Dine-in or order for pick up, the staff is always nice.\""}
{"text":"This place is a favorite place for sushi, it is excellent quality especially for the price, which is reasonable. I come here often with my brother for sushi. The staff is friendly and the food is good."}
{"text":"Service is really bad here, they barely speak English, will walk by your table and ignore you. The sushi is good, not the best not the worst. I will go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I have ever had.  I was in Boulder City on business and did not expect to find such a mouth watering sushi restaurant.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Consistently awsome sushi. always fresh great sushi chefs owner is very kind and personable. Try the live shell fish on weekends especially live scallop and abalone.  incredibly fresh salmon and tuna. spicy tuna hand rolls are very generous. they need some work on the salmon skin hand roll. no gobo root really come on."}
{"text":"First time here and I'll definitely be back for news. Excellent lunch specials!! $9 for two sushi rolls, salad, rice, and dumplings. Instead of two sushi rolls, my kiddo had chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu. She loved both (but didn't care of the katsu sauce). They have a good assortment of rolls, the restaurant was clean, and the staff friendly. Well done Momo!"}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant is worth the drive to Boulder city from Henderson. It's a hidden gem. I wish I had taken a picture of the sushi but we ate it all so fast! They even gave us fresh wasabi which I've never been offered before it was so delicious. We will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Great lunch with quality sushi and rolls. For lunch i  recommend the sushi lunch12.99 you get 6 pieces of sushi and a too along with appetizers. 
Dinner grab the list. It's all good great service and people."}
{"text":"We had an exceptional lunch. Wonderful food. The shrimp tempura was the best I have ever had. My husband had the Combo A spicy tuna roll. Everything was fresh and beautifully presented. The hostess (owner?) was cheerful and responsive. The atmosphere was comfortable. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Went for lunch midweek.  Arrived about an hour before the lunch special ended and were seated immediately.   Lunch special is $8.95 for two items (add a buck for beef or salmon).  Served Bento style with miso soup as a starter.  Portion sizes were pleasantly larger than I expected.  They also have a sushi lunch for $12.95 consisting of one roll and 6 pcs of nigiri sushi.  Decor and staff are a plus as well.  Overall a great lunch spot if you're in the area.  They also have an extensive selection on their SPECIAL rolls.  Worth checking out for you sushi fans.

{"text":"My wife says it's absolutely delicious. Unfortunately I can't have seafood so I'm unable to join her. Very nice Ambience though and pleasant staff"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of sushi.  I like it, but it's not something i get excited about when the family decides they want sushi.

This place is the exception.  I've had their various rolls and they were all typical for sushi, until, i had their Sex on the Beach roll!  Just, WOW!  

Now whenever my family wants sushi, I get excited to come here, and get my Sex on the Beach roll!  Their crab rangoon is very good as well.

They get quite busy and sometimes it takes a bit before our server delivers our bill, or takes are next order, but I look around the restaurant and see every single seat filled, and I understand so I exercise some patience."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday late afternoon. I would give it 4 stars if they would have turned the music off. I have no idea why any restaurant even bothers with music. It's simply irritating and detracts from an atmosphere of relaxation. I do not go to restaurants to be irritated by someone else's crappy taste in music coming out of tinny speakers.

The place was crowded. The tables are small and cramped. Very little space between tables too. Cramped enough that it was hard to find a place for our table of four to put stuff. The customers were well behaved at least. 

The service was only adequate. There were too many customers for the waitresses to have to juggle, but they were pleasant and did a decent job. The menu is very extensive so at least everyone (including those that don't care for sushi) can find something they may like. The green salad with ginger dressing was the best thing I had. Generally there was nothing wrong with the food, but my impression is that the needle was pointing a little to the bland side. I think the prices are about where they normally would be for a Japanese restaurant, but I've had better values at other sushi restaurants. Generally speaking I was happy to have experienced dinner there with my spouse and friends. I recommend you give it a try at least. I think you will find it .... OK."}
{"text":"Great food and service! They were open on this 4th of July day and we were happily surprised and hungry for sushi. We were seated quickly and our food brought to us within 10min. The wasabi was fresh along with the ginger.  We had green mussels, one of my favorites and it didn't dissappoint.  Rolls with fresh fish and great sauces. Pricing was about average.  Will definitely recommend and be back for more!!"}
{"text":"I've been staying at the HGI in Henderson for 15 years and always going to Green Valley Ranch when I don't walk across the street to Sierra Gold. Looking for healthy and good, I searched for Sushi and found Momo. It may be in suburban Henderson but this sushi would play in Malibu without difficulty. Quality fish and I got introduced to lemon flavored Saki - Yuzu Aladin.  The selection of rolls is almost overwhelming, but great. I vouch for the Jennifer 2 and the Candy Canne."}
{"text":"Been going here for years, food and location is always good :) Fish is fresh and great serving size. Serving staff is also very friendly. Nice ambiance, perfect for date nights. Just the right amount of crowd."}
{"text":"My go-to sushi spot for dinner.  Love the tomato roll and rock-n-roll roll. Great tako (octopus) too!!"}
{"text":"Everyone here is very nice. Sit at the bar and enjoy sushi that is unbeatable in Vegas. For the price, you won't find better quality fish. I bring coworkers from all over the country to this location. Haven't found anything better in my year here and it's close to what I've had in Vista, CA."}
{"text":"Variety of rolls is killer! White horse was delicious and citrusy. I think another rolls was called \"when shrimp meets crab\" which was amazing!!! Chef said it was the most popular. The only downside is that this place doesn't have an all you can eat option so the total bill was a bit more expensive. However, I would definitely come back if I wanted just a couple of rolls and not want to stuff myself. I came on a weekday night so it wasn't crowded and service was good."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in town. James is an absolute master! Sit at the bar if you can. Absolutely in love with this place."}
{"text":"Love it. Food is amazing here. Great service, the people that work here is very friendly. Overall is a great place to eat and some delicious sushi."}
{"text":"The food here is so amazing!  The have quality ingredients. They have many dishes that you cannot find at an AYCE.  To top it all off, the customer service is nothing short of EXCELLENT!  Oh and the 2 for 1 sake?  DONE."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Vegas! Never had a bad experience, and the service is always top notch. My favorite rolls are the Irish Roll, Galleria, Mexico City, Lovely TSC and Kiss of Fire. Really though, every roll here is big, delicious and flavorful. The best!"}
{"text":"I really love Momo Sushi.  I've been about 5 or 6 times.  The menu is simple, but the fish is usually very fresh, and prepared well.

This is nothing fancy, but really great quality sushi.  Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!! 
A bit pricey 
3 stars because the waitress was so unprofessional and rude. She didn't even say anything to us just grabbed the menus and sent us to a table."}
{"text":"For a local sushi spot-- this place is great! 

The fancy rolls are good, but usually when a place Is all about it's Americanized rolls it's usually because they are hiding the lack I flavor from their fish.

However, simple rolls and Sashimi are amazing too!  
 
My love and I split the sushi boat for two once and that was a gem! 

And ASAHI ZERO!!! If you don't drink but want sushi and a beer-- get this non alcoholic treasure! 

We keep trying to find it at a store but can only seem to find how to order from Japan! I appreciate them stocking it up!"}
{"text":"Went to this place trusting Yelp to guide me right.  Overall feeling was \"meh\".  It just seemed there was no love in the food.  Tempura was just sufficient.  Nothing really stuck out as amazing.  I have absolutely no idea why it gets so many good reviews on the site."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple times. The food is good and it's a nice quiet place to relax and enjoy. Staff is friendly and pretty quick with whatever you need."}
{"text":"Always enjoy the sushi and food here!  Great sushi chefs- make my special Spicy Shrimp Tempura Roll."}
{"text":"Sushi was very freshly made and tasted great. The waitress was nice and prompt. Wide selection of rolls to choose from. Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"They sushi chefs are so friendly and their sushi is amazing I tired their Irish roll, and thought it was amazing"}
{"text":"Ok, first of, this is a Japanese restaurant owned by Koreans, so you can start imagine the authentic quality of the \"sushi\" there.  Friends and I got there hoping that this newly opened restaurant could add a golden star of the day, but oh boy was I wrong... The waitor was so rude and the food was awful comparing with some of the good authentic sushi restaurants in town. This is definitely a no-go, go waste your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"My husband and I love sushi. The sushi is so good and fresh. I love the screaming orgasm. The servers are always friendly and the chefs are super funny!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place and they definitely cater to there customer. Plus the price is great for high quality Japanese food. When I'm in the area I eat there."}
{"text":"It's fantastic!  Definitely a 5 Star sushi restaurant!

It's the best sushi in Henderson, NV."}
{"text":"Great food!  We ordered delivery via Door Dash and everything was great, order was accurate, delivery was fast, food was excellent."}
{"text":"They have original rolls, paired with amazing sauces.  I have never tasted so many great flavors in a sushi roll.  I have spend more $ on sushi and this was far better and you can chill at the sushi bar and watch football, love it!!!!"}
{"text":"I moved here from Richmond, BC a year ago,(best sushi outside Japan) and I gotta tell ya this place is pretty good for Calgary.  It's not cheap, but I find it comparable in the city, good service and decent size sashimi pieces."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there today and I liked that it wasn't too loud or quiet. However after placing my order I noticed a cockroach crawling by my foot and not just a regular roach a big ass one! So we left. I'm sure the food is good but we were totally grossed out by the roach."}
{"text":"This is the only sushi restaurant I go to. My boyfriend loves the lunch special. They have delicious special rolls. I highly recommend stopping in there if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The food is good.  The food comes quickly, but otherwise the service is miserable.  The waitresses are slow, the refills have to be requested, and if you ask for no ice they forget on subsequent refills.  The worst part is the price; it is way overpriced... possibly the most expensive sushi in Vegas.  There are many better places that give you more bank for your buck.  Overall, an average place at best, but extremely overpriced.  Based on pricing, I would not return."}
{"text":"Arguably our favorite sushi spot out of anywhere we've been in any state.  Great vibe for either an evening out with the young kids, a quick lunch break, or a date night.  The food is tasty, the service is quick, noninvasive, no mistakes."}
{"text":"Walked by randomly and decided to check it out.  Wow what a find!!!  Food was great and prices aren't out to gouge you.   Def recommended"}
{"text":"Great food as always . Bento dinner  is huge so make sure you are hungry or share it . Tempura dinner size is also big . Good atmosphere"}
{"text":"The sushi here is excellent. The fish is very fresh; certainly one of the best sushi places in Las Vegas. I'm very glad they opened up in Boulder City. We'll keep coming back. Jen the waitress is excellent as well!"}
{"text":"We just had lunch there. It was delicious as always. Its our go to place for sushi. Delicious food at a reasonable price and the service was great."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  My second time there.  Waited 25 minutes for one roll.  Waitress said there was a miscommunication between her & the chef.  Asked to have some food boxed up.  Waitress took the plate & never came back with the box of left overs.  She said she threw it away.  Manager said the best they could do is $2.00 off the bill.  Oh, and I overheard the next booth complaining & wanting to see the manager.
Never again Momo!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Momo's ever since they have been opened and that has been well over 7 yrs ago. I have recently moved to Seattle, WA and have not found my new sushi place and having Momo withdrawals. 

I just wanted to say that they have amazing food and provide a friendly Atmosphere. I don't think anybody could be disappointed.  I would highly recommend the spicy baby Tako it is delicious and you wont find it anywhere else. 

The customer service is great. The owner and the staff know my family by our names which is awesome. The best seats are obviously at the sushi bar.   I can't wait to come back to Henderson its the first place I will visit."}
{"text":"I love this place! I go here all the time they just make good sushi. But beware a friend of mine got food poison once. I don't remember what he ordered but I would kinda look out."}
{"text":"Customer service is TERRIBLE!!! MANAGER IS VERY MEAN.
My boyfriend had ordered me a yum yum roll over the phone today and when i went to pick it up, I didnt check to make sure the order was correct (my mistake) but i assumed they had gotten in right since i was right next to him when he ordered it over the phone. When i got back to work, i realized my order was completely wrong. They gave me a salmon roll. My boyfriend called back and they told him it was a 1.50 dollar difference, but this time wouldn't let him pay over the phone (when they had JUST taken his card info over the phone on the first order) I told him it was fine and that i would just pay the difference when i got in, wasn't a big deal at all, just  weird. So when i got in, i gave them my card to pay the difference which wasn't even 2 dollars, and she told me the minimum for card transactions was 10 dollars. I had explained to her that they had messed up on my first order --which was only 6 dollars, not 10, and that i was just coming in to get the correct one and i didn't have any cash, thinking she would just let me do it on my card since they already messed up my first order. She started arguing with me and telling me i must purchase something for 10 dollars, which i wasn't going to do. Then she said she had a new waitress and that was why it happened. I said \"so because your waitress messed up, im being punished'? she then asked me if i had the original messed up order, i told her no, i wasn't asked to bring it in. she said \"well isn't it common sense?\" HAAAA. I was very nice until this moment. Isn't it common sense to get my FIRST order right??? and then be polite when i come in, out of my way, for the SECOND time to get my order??? Lady was seriously out of line. I walked out and will NEVER be back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I've been here countless of times and have never left unsatisfied. The food here is great ( I recommend the Irish roll ). Service is great and the employees are always keeping a smooth vibe. Love this place."}
{"text":"Likely our new go-to place. We were regulars at another place and often were treated like royalty so we kept going. On a whim we tried Momo takeout before a drive-in movie. Our first comment was, \"if takeout is this good... we need to dine-in.\"

So, we did. And it was excellent. Fun, cheesy, welcoming and the fish was fresh while the rolls actually took us by surprise along with the check which was half of what we were used to. We're quickly going to be regulars here."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi spot.  A hidden gem in Boulder City.  Stopped in on my way back from Hoover Dam!"}
{"text":"Let's have some MO... Momo Sushi. An appropriate name for this place, Momo (more more) Sushi. What an awesome sushi place for lunch or dinner on this side of Henderson. 

The location is kind of odd as you don't really see it from Stephanie. The whole strip mall is not even facing the main road, it's awkwardly sideways. Just pull into the driveway past Marie Calendars and it will be on your left side.

So yes, the food here is awesome especially the Agadashi tofu. I've had this dish numerous times and I really do appreciate the presentation at Momo. The tofu is cut up in nice bite size pieces and sitting inside a bowl of broth. At other places the tofu is cut larger. When it's served larger so many awkward things can happen. 1) you cut it with your chopsticks and the crispy glaze breaks off. 2) you bite into it and you look like a Neanderthal with food dropping out of your mouth. 3) other embarrassing moments that should be left alone. The pieces at Momo were perfect!!

The rolls were so good. If you like tuna try the ultimate tuna roll. Spicy tuna with tuna on top, sitting in a spicy garlic type sauce/ oil. So good and the sauce keeps it moist! 

So yes, whenever I get my nails done at Euphora I'm high tailing to Momo for lunch... For MOre sushi and Agadashi tofu.

Oh don't forget to check in on Yelp! We received free green tea ice cream! YAY!"}
{"text":"Our first date night after the birth of our baby boy and Momo Sushi was the perfect pick! We ordered the love boat and it was wonderful! The perfect mix of all the standards: sushi, teriyaki and tempura. The service was fast and friendly. The ambiance is simple. We will be back... Again and again!"}
{"text":"Ever since my first visit here, I can honestly say this is the only sushi place I'll ever go to again. Period. The majority of the time, it's hardly busy, and if it is, service is still fantastic. The staff are very courteous and productive, and the waitresses are always on top of drink refills.
The interior design is very appealing. I personally favor the low lighting since I am rather sensitive to bright lights. It provides a comfortable atmosphere I hardly see at any other restaurants.
As far as their menu goes, every single specialty roll I've tried has been prepared adeptly and left me beyond satisfied. My personal favorites are the Screaming Honey, Crazy Roll, and Danaka's Favorite. Not once have I received any sort of sickness after eating here. I top it all off with some delectable Tempura Ice Cream. I definitely recommend it!
And I can't leave out their prices. They're surprisingly affordable for a sushi place. Two rolls and ice cream for two people generally amounts to around $20.
In the end, I definitely recommend Momo Sushi to anyone, whether you're a sushi fan or not. Not only do they offer rolls, they provide other lunch and dinner options which consist of teriyaki chicken and other samples."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week! I love there Philadelphia roll and their prices are very reasonable! Nice staff also!"}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I came here looking fo some good sushi. Its pretty good kind of expensive for what I thought it was worth. The service there is acceptable"}
{"text":"Dark atmosphere perfect for an intimate occasion and the food is amazing. Friendly sushi chefs and fast serving staff."}
{"text":"This place is very clean and the décor is inviting. The sushi chef are more interactive when you sit at the bar. Very appropriate for a date night or any special occasion. Prices are comparable."}
{"text":"Food is always great and the waitresses are really nice people. Love their udon and they have a variety of unique sushi. The amount of wasabi and ginger they give you is also plenty. Great place! They have Korean beer too like Hite!"}
{"text":"Went here with a client, her suggestion. I was really impressed! Fantastic food at great prices. Service was fast and friendly. I highly recommend it. And will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service and the best sushi! I have been coming here for over 10 years."}
{"text":"The sushi was excellent and the service was great. The service was fast and the four of us enjoyed our meal and sushi at a really great price highly recommended"}
{"text":"I had a Rest com coupon so was able to convince my husband to go for lunch.... ( he usually only wants to go to AYCE sushi.) He had the Lunch Special ($8.95) with the Miso soup, other sides, chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu. He thought both chickens were very good, the teriyaki chicken was not fatty and was tender & moist. He loved the Miso soup, thought it was one of the best he had tried at local places. He also had ebi, magura and hamachi nigiri, and thought all tasted fresh. I had the usual embarrassingly named rolls and they were quite tasty. When the older sushi chef had to tell the other chef to make the S on the B roll, they both giggled and shook their heads.... but I got past it and it was good eating! I had been so focused on the menu, that I didn't look up and see the daily special board right in front of me until after ordering... I will be back to try some of those. We sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed watching the chefs create the plates, er.. boats. One boat was made with a fish he filleted as we watched. The final product had what was left of the fish as adornment. Looks much better than it sounds."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out it was ready in 15 minutes. The sushi was great and just as expected! The staff was super friendly and helpful when arriving to pick it up. 
Inside looked nice too while I was there, would love to eat in some time. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"1st time here and I have to admit it was very very good. Many places here in Vegas don't have live shrimp which I love and this place does. I will definitely be coming back to this place and I think I found my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Had a yelp voucher and they were happy to accept it. Fair priced and the sushi rolls were yum! Would recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome service & great fresh food! Gotta try Jennifer 2, Momo tower and must try the crunch shrimp! DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"The drive is a pain in the butt from my house, but it's SO worth it. I ordered salmon and miso soup, and it was out of this world. I got it as a carry out, and I was so pleased that everything was fresh and the soup was hot when I got home to enjoy it. Friendly staff, clean establishment. I'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Fantastic amazing sushi!  Tried this place out for the first time and it's unbelievable. Fresh and delicious with great service. I will definitely be regulars here considering I live down the street. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my stepdad the other night. Not terrible sushi but I've had better elsewhere. Customer service was very weak especially when my dad did the yelp check-in and she wouldn't accept it because it expired in February! He argued with her on why it's still up if it's expired and after a few minutes she finally apologized and let him use it just \"the one time\". I definitely won't be back due to the service vs food but it was worth a try!"}
{"text":"Really bummed :( that this place wasn't good. Especially when I live in Henderson. Ordered the Kiss of Fire and it was not good at all. It was edible yes, but not that fresh or appetizing. I'm a regular at Sushi Fever on W. Sahara which blows this place out of the water. If anybody that comes here thinks this is good sushi go visit Sushi Fever and you'll see the huge difference. And btw I completely unbiased to both places the food here just wasn't good.  I've had enough sushi over the years to know great sushi and mediocre sushi. The tuna did not look bright and pink it was more brown and pink. The service was meh as well not bad, but not great. 

Also as a side note, BABYSTACKS and Genghis Grill which are right next store are both great!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for a while im since I moved it's closer than I.LOVE SUSHI but just as good. There's no AYCE but the quality and service is definitely worth the price. The staff is friendly and attentive, the fish is fresh and generous cuts are given. On weekends they have live scallops and ama ebi which is my favourite , even in the week days they have excellent quality scallops and not the small bay kind either. I am not a roll person I am very picky about my quality sashimi and this place never disappoints. Definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I enjoy Momo Sushi for the great tast of their box meals... the Kalbi is delicious and I love their salad dressing."}
{"text":"Best sushi (for a reasonable price) that I've had in Las Vegas so far. I ordered the Kiss of Fire roll and my date ordered the When Shrimp Meets Crab roll. Both were pretty damn amazing. I recommend both if you're brand new to the place. Fairly small restaurant, but the menu is unparalleled, and the sushi chefs are hilarious and very entertaining to watch."}
{"text":"We are from out of town, yet felt like we were at home here! The wife got trashed with sushi chef James and we finished up with the mango sakitini. Absolute greatness! Some of the best sushi I've ever had! The presentation was beautiful and amazing! The staff was so, so friendly and kind. So fun to drink with too!"}
{"text":"We love love love this place! Best service you'll find anywhere. Extremely good with kids. Super nice, very fast service, high quality food. Let's just say their screaming \"O\" really screams \"o soo delicious\". I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I come here often for there fresh sushi rolls and pretty good rolls. The green tea ice cream is all ways a good desert. The momoyama roll is really good."}
{"text":"Wow!  I think I am becoming a biased reviewer of Momo. The  last item we ordered and received was the Momo Kampachi. What a way to finish off a wonderful meal. 

The staff is warm and welcoming. James the chef as you see from the picture is an artist and I ate his Mona Lisa. Just so fresh and vibrant. The fresh wasabi popes with spice and the super white tuna was so clean tasting with a hint of lemon added. 

All rolls were just a great the standard screaming 'o' is a must in our book. Tuna with ponzu sauce and some mayo which of course is bad but tastes so so good. 

Jon and Julie have made a place we love. We found Momo over a decade ago and are still in love. Friendly people and such great food."}
{"text":"3 stars because the food was really good.  Sit at the bar so the chefs can get your rolls and nigiri to you as it's prepared   The wait staff is slow and overwhelmed with two waitresses tending to the whole restaurant and the bar.   Food is really good tho can't deny how good the Ugly Roll was.   The lunch specials offer a ton of food"}
{"text":"I would give Momo Sushi more stars if the service matched the food.

I will be straightforward by saying that the service is horrible. The ladies who work there are extremely grouchy and inattentive. I have given them plenty of chances to change my opinion in the last 6 months and it just hasn't gotten any better. I have to add that I am always friendly to servers and I try to be understanding, so for me to be dissatisfied with service is worth listening to.

Now the food...

The food is pretty good. The sushi is fresh (although could use more variety - a lot of cooked rolls) and the bento boxes/dinner plates are a good option for non-sushi eaters (particularly the kalbi short ribs).The servings are generous and most days good food is enough to get me to come back."}
{"text":"Went there for a Friday night dinner. Great service and amazing food. They don't have AYCE but the prices were not bad at all. Probably the same price we pay for AYCE at other places. Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"\"It's okay to eat fish, because they don't have any feelings...\" - Kurt Cobain

I love fish...raw, seared, roasted, deep fried, smoked, whatever. But I have yet to find a \"go to\" spot here in the valley for good sashimi and sushi. When the wife and I lived down near the east side of Trop, we used to go to Sushi On Tropicana. It was a really good AYCE place, unfortunately it closed. Since moving to Henderson, we have been trying various locations that are just \"meh\". But, we keep coming back to Momo Sushi. They aren't an all-you-can-eat kind of place, but that's okay, their fish is pretty damned good...fresh, well prepared, delicious.

Located down on Stephanie, right next to Baby Stacks Cafe (excellent breakfast, BTW), right across from Burlington Coat Factory. Very unassuming and dark when you walk in, until you hear the familiar \"irasshaimase!\" greeting from the sushi chefs...good sized sushi bar and smallish dining room beside it. They do have booths, though. Waitresses are friendly and quick with the drink order, which is nice.

Before I met my wife, I would usually order my sushi nigiri and by the piece...she's introduced me to the world of specialty rolls, spicy mayo and sweet sauces...why not? (Still getting used to the cream cheese thing, though). Momo has an array of specialty rolls, like most places, difference being, these are pretty good sized rolls (maybe making up for the fact they don't do AYCE sushi?). Most are priced in the mid-range of between $8.95 and $14.95.

The wife's favorite is, of course, the Screaming Orgasm (insert girlish giggle here...), seared tuna piled around a mountain of shredded daikon radish surrounded by a moat of spicy garlic ponzu sauce and mayo. Get the large, it's good. My favorites are the Spider Roll, I love soft-shell crab...and the Something Wrong 69 roll, more soft-shell crab with shrimp tempura, topped with an assortment of fish (a little bit of everything, iz oishii). If I still have room at the end of the meal, I'll sometimes skip the mochi ice cream and get the Zaru Soba (buckwheat noodles, served cold). I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it on the menu, it's the perfect way to finish a meal.

So, I don't know if I've found my \"go-to\" spot yet...but, Momo Sushi is close. If your looking for a good izakaya restaurant/sushi joint, check it out...I just noticed they have Hamachi Kama on the menu, will have get that next time...I love a nice fatty piece of broiled or grilled fish collar."}
{"text":"I got 4 different sushi rolls and they were all good. All the meat was also cooked. My cousin got a tuna sashimi and there were worms on it, not sure what part of the sashimi they came from. The staff believes it was from the bean sprouts."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch special bento box. Decent deal and decent food. Nothing special about it though.

Also, the service could have been better. There were only two tables, including ours, with two waitresses. It still took two attempts to get ginger/wasabi."}
{"text":"Magically delicious! Lol! Tiny spot, but chill, relaxing setting. Really good sushi, miso soup, and sizzling Kalbi. A little pricey, but the taste of food is worth it."}
{"text":"Got the Chirashi bowl for lunch when I was working on this side of town over the summer. The bowl I received was beautifully presented with fresh fish and a good-sized portion of it. I liked most of what I had but don't personally care for their Cajun tuna at all, the seasoning is overwhelming and the texture was hard as if it was recently defrosted. 

Other reviews complain about the service, but I sat at the sushi bar and the chef was polite. When it came time to get my bill, the server was nowhere to be found, but I was one of only two customers. Their menu of rolls is considerable, but I'd probably stick to the same order if I returned."}
{"text":"I live fairly close to Momo and the prices are much better than Globe Fish so it's usually my sushi place of choice.

The rolls are interesting and well put together. I love their negitoro roll (tuna belly with a little piece of green onion). 

Pro:
Clean, cute, good sushi and service

Cons:
I really hate the spicy sauce on the spicy tuna rolls and spicy tuna sashimi. It's my favorite thing to order at most sushi places but Momo's sauce choice is just not for me. The sauce overpowers the flavor of the fish completely"}
{"text":"Prices seemed good.
Place looks bigger, now they removed the walls.  Been a long time ago I've ate here.
Sushi - palm tree really good.
Sushi - Alaska roll, not bad
Lunch special - kalbi, under cook, only one slab.  Teriyaki beef, eh.  Salad, I had a half piece tooth pick in there.  I was wondering why my salad had a hard piece in it.  I showed waitress and took pictures to post.  Rice, norm.  Tempura, two pieces only.  One is baked sushi roll?, idk.  Other piece, I don't remember.  Miso good.
Only one server, ask if everything okay, but I rather they just come fill our drinks up.  We had to ask.
One sushi chef behind bar.
Return.  Never.
I would say, no stars.  But one for just still existing this long.  And sushi a ok."}
{"text":"Very good place.  Not an AYCE but the nigiri and roll sizes are very large and filling.   I have had the uni twice here and it was also fresh and delicious.    I would have posted pictures but was too hungry to bother with the camera.  :)

Add AYCE to menu!"}
{"text":"There was a restaurant.com deal I picked up a few months back for $100 off $200 tab. I got some friends together (6 of us total) and went down to Henderson to give this place a shot. First off, the menu has photos, that's awesome! Makes me picking my sushi so much easier. We all started off with some warm saki and a few appetizers. When it came to the dinner, we all each, ordered 2 different rolls and just shared. My favorite was the Cherry Blossom, it was AMAZING! After we stuffed our faces with over 12 different rolls, we found out we were still $6 short of our $200 tab. I couldn't believe all of that was still under $200. So at the end, our bill was $144 with the gratuity that is added b/c of the gift certificate. So with that, we got 4 apps, 6 sake's, 6 sappora's, and 12 rolls. Great deal!"}
{"text":"Service was good, everything was clean and the sushi was delicious! Everything came out super fast and tasted really good, I'm actually not a huge sushi person because everything I've tasted in the past wasn't amazing, but this place turned me around! Definitely some place to check out after a day of shopping in the nearby shopping centers."}
{"text":"Mo options, Mo flavor, Mo stars! I was nervous to give a new sushi place a try in a city that I don't regularly eat, but Momo was a treat! Centrally located in Boulder City, this is a gem of a sushi restaurant where you wouldn't expect!

I ordered two rolls and miso soup. The miso was great, which is usually hard to mess up, but it was definitely the best miso I've ever had. The highlight of my meal, however, was the Jesty Salmon roll. If you like citrus and salmon, this simple roll will be a big hit with you!

The other roll that I ordered was the dragon roll which was a step out of my comfort zone. It was worth it! Very tasty roll and I would highly recommend it.

Overall, quality and freshness of fish were amazing and I really enjoyed it. The two downsides I found were service wasn't quite as helpful as I'd like and price was pretty high. I think it's difficult to get such fresh fish in that area but it was certainly more pricey than was worth it for the size of portions. 

5/5 Food, 4/5 Location, 3/5 Service, but I would still recommend giving this place a try at least once!"}
{"text":"Momo Sushi is my absolute favorite place to go for sushi. I wish they had All You Can Eat, but I'm pretty sure they don't because the quality of the fish is so high! They would definitely lose money on it, haha. I love their sashimi, the sushi chefs here are amazing! I leave always satisfied and happy. Great service, great quality, and super cozy. I have been coming here for over a decade and I will always return."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times, but one day I decided I had a long day at work doing morning shift and wanted to wind down here for lunch.

I sat at the sushi bar and I was familiar with the staff, my old sushi chef from Yama Sushi was now here (surprise surprise) making my rolls.

I adore the Family Roll and the Leo Ball. The Mochi here is also excellent.

My previous experiences were all good. I had gone with a friend once and they had a super spicy roll. The waitress noticed they were having a hard time with how spicy it was, so she brought us FREE mochi ice cream.

I was expecting good service and good sushi. Few people were in there as it was lunchtime and a weekday.

Regardless of there being multiple sushi chefs and very few customers (4 at most), my rolls weren't made very well and they took a while to arrive, even with help. My drink was constantly empty. And the worst part (and this is why I haven't returned since and didn't give 4-5 stars...), I WAITED OVER AN HOUR AND 20 MINUTES FOR MY CHECK. I must have asked for it in 10 different ways 20 different times to 5 different people...

I was at a loss. I wanted to dine and dash so badly, but I'm not like that. And hell, I haven't even gone back - so maybe I should have.

That was the most ridiculous experience ever and I turn the other way now and go to Sapporo down the street.

BUT...I was told that the head sushi chef here is willing to teach women how to make sushi.
I don't know of anywhere else that is, and the sushi chefs here always tell me women weren't taught how to make sushi for the longest time.
Interesting."}
{"text":"The sushi and sashimi were amazingly delish. I ordered to go and promptly picked up the order. It was well prepared and packaged to look as if they were plated. I was impressed at the attention to detail even with takeout. But more importantly the food was wonderful. The flavors explode in your mouth. Anyways, fresh sushi is the only way to go. It was a little pricey but hey...You're getting fresh food prepared as you order it. We will be back again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Vegas. It's small and intimate with it never being loud or crazy busy even on a Friday night. Our favorite items are the Sizzling Eel and Dragon Roll with Edamame being our appetizer and using their free ice cream for dessert (you get the coupon upon check in on yelp). For two people, that fills us right up. Quite a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere here.  The service was excellent and fast.  I will definitely be back.  I usually opt for all-you-can eat, but if you want a nicer, sit-down place, I recommend here."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch on a Sunday and there weren't many people around. The waitress was attentive and friendly. I ordered the lunch special with tonkatsu and shrimp/vegetable tempura which was delicious and filling. I wanted to order sushi, and it's awesome that they had pictures of what their sushi rolls looked like, but as I mentioned, I was too stuffed from eating the lunch special. I'd recommend anyone to stop by Momo Sushi to eat."}
{"text":"The Irish roll is one of the best rolls I've had. The orgasm roll has such an amazing surprising flavor to it. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"We tried Momo Sushi for the first time tonight. The food was very good but the service was completely awful! We waited for ever for the food even though no one was there. Neither of the two waitresses had a clue as to what the are doing. We waited forever to get a check When we finally asked for a check (although it was clear we had been done fore some time), they still took another 10 minutes. We probably waited 20-25 minutes for a check so we could get out of there. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the world...amazing service , Everything is so fresh ,Great atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"STILL the best $14 eat in Nevada by far! Excellent pricing, excellent quality, excellent prep.....really nice ppl as well....including Greg K. who turned be on to Settabello ...another winner.

CES 2017 - returned as usual and as usual STILL the very best priced eats one can expect, great ambiance, great food, good wine, great prices.... ALWAYS top recommendation."}
{"text":"Service: This, in combination with the food, is why I rate this place with 4 stars. The servers were so kind, polite, and prompt. We also loved the miso soup at the beginning of our meal and the scoop of ice cream at the end. Our drinks were refreshed and they had a smile on their face each time they came by. Yes were full !"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to see that the place was crowded and the sushi bar almost full! I saw the beautiful tuna the chef was apportioning and wrapping well to keep nice and chilled. My friend and I both had the lunch boxes and I shamefully ate everything on my plate!! It was a bit pricey but if it insures fresh fish and well cooked food- then it follows they buy the best top of the line fish.
I read from a chef's diary, that discount sushi bars buy the cheapest quality fish - so I am going by that nugget of inside info.
I am giving this 4 stars because service can be improved. The waitress might be overworked, underpaid and undertipped.
I would go back there again - for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place, we were staying at the Hoover dam lodge and did a Yelp search for sushi.  Menu has a lot of offerings, food was great and service was so pleasant!  I'm Japanese and can be a snob to non-Japanese owned restaurants when it comes to authenticity.  This place satisfied!  Even my picky daughter found her favorite agedashi tofu on the menu!  Prices were reasonable.  We had such a good experience there that the next night, when driving back late from Vegas, we called a to go order in and again got pleasant service.  What a good find for us on our vacation!"}
{"text":"Great service, walked in and was immediately greeted in a nice manner. Food is great and comes out extremely fast! Taste is very authentic also! I will definitely be coming back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Great spot for sushi in Boulder City. The service has never disappointed and the food has always tasted delicious. There's not a happy hour and they're only open for dinner, but they do bogo sake! Can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"I ordered the bento box and the toro sushi man I can't believe how good the food is here!!  The staff are very nice the food is very fresh and the lunch price is very fair.  I definitely recommend this place, I don't give 5 stars unless the place meets my criteria which are, nice staff, cleanliness, fresh food, deep fried food are not oily, and if they have the authentic traditional Japanese style food. This place met all of it..."}
{"text":"Their sushi isn't really anything special. You can get it just about anywhere.

We went there tonight, and wanted to order Tuna belly sashimi. Our waitress told me they didn't have it.... Because it was too expensive. One might think that they would take it off the menu... Or say that it sold out.

Our dessert was brought before dinner was over, and the tempura ice cream tasted odd. The ice cream looked pink, and there were red dots in it. 

The waitress told us it was 'vanilla'. She told me the pink was from the batter. Maybe I need to brush up on my tempura....... Because I thought it is suppose to be golden brown and delicious"}
{"text":"Went here today with some friends. We arrived at lunch time and had a big group, 10 people, but surprisingly this place was pretty empty. So we were seated right away. We usually go to AYCE places, but the pricing here for not being AYCE was very reasonable and the food was of high quality. We had 1 lunch bento that came with miso soup, side salad, 2 entree items (chicken teriyaki and kalbi was what we ordered) and rice. We also ordered 3 rolls, and age dashi and the \"rolls rice ball\" and our bill came to $59. The \"rolls rice ball\" was amazing, was rice with fish and sauce mixed in, so a roll in a place. All the other rolls were very tasty as well. Definitely will go back to this place to try more items. I had to knock off some points though for the service. The waitress sighed and rolled her eyes when we said it would be 3 separate tabs, and she seemed to have a hard time keeping the orders straight. The other thing she did, which kind of shocked us all, was when asking if my friend wanted a refill, she grabbed the glass from her while she was mid drink to go refill it. Right out of her hand. My husband told me later that another waitress apologized for her and said that she was upset because 2 servers called out sick so she was called in. Sorry but that's her issue, one that shouldn't be taken out on the customer. Hopefully the service will be better next trip."}
{"text":"Went for the first time at Momo Sushi and I am not impressed and happy with their customer  service. For a Sushi lover, I have eaten and visited a lot of Sushi establishments in different states and here at home. The food is good but the service lacked. When we arrived the reception from the staff was very strained. It's as if sating \"hello\" or \"welcome\" was too much work for them. 
We were sat by the server and each of us were given menus. Since it was our first time, we were reading, very carefully the menu so we can make good decisions in what to eat. Server came to take our orders more than once. I told her we needed more time but she kept coming back really fast without allowing us to have time to decide. We felt rushed. 
After we ordered and our food delivered, you'd think that they will come back to check up on us and see if we needed our glasses re-filled with our beverages. No one did that. I was parched and I had to get someone's attention to get my glass of water refilled. Could it be that I only had water and not Soda or an alcoholic beverage? Whatever the reason, I feel that I shouldn't have to flag someone that many times to get my glass of beverage refilled. 
The food was good but I've eaten better in other establishments that are cheaper who also gave us better service than they. 
The place is simply not friendly and welcoming. 
To return to this place will not happen again. Not a  recommendation to anyone. 
I give them two thumbs down."}
{"text":"Was impressed with this place.  Decided to try out a new sushi spot, which is always a scary thing to do but this place did not disappoint!!!

Sushi chefs were very friendly and very funny...the food was VERY good, and for the price and variety...you cant beat it.  

We will totally be back!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Great sushi and super nice!! A weekly spot for me !!"}
{"text":"The sushi is amazing. The Ugly Roll is absolutely delicious. The restaurant is small but cozy and their sushi bar is on point. Plenty of choices for everyone!!"}
{"text":"Hit and miss but overall pretty good. The service is often lacking but the food is so darn good we still make a visit every so often. The teriyaki chicken is a must try."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the fish is fresh. It can get expensive if you're hungry since they don't have AYCE. I had salmon and albacore nigiri, both good. Also the Triple A Roll, Momo soft shell crab roll & Japanese Nachos. I liked the Triple A, the other two were just ok."}
{"text":"Momo Sushi is above the rest!!! We have been coming here for years, and have NEVER had a bad experience. We live SOOOO far from it now, but still make time to stop by anytime we are on this side of town! We've tried a lot of different sushi spots trying to find something closer, but after u've had momo it is so hard to settle for anything else!! Our favorite rolls: Irish roll, Mexico City Roll, Ugly Roll. WE LOVE MOMO!!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and exquisite sushi. Pleasant and friendly staff. Beautiful interior. True, prices are too high. I advise you to visit a sushi lover."}
{"text":"I moved to Vegas from Arkansas, where I had not one but three sushi places that i absolutely adored. The move to Vegas meant no sushi or sushi dates with my best friend, but I seemed to have gotten extremely lucky. 
A friend of mine took me to this place after disagreeing with the main place I picked because it had a drive through and I fell so in love. My roll was delicious and so was his. I actually had him go back a few weeks later to get me some Miso soup because I forgot to try and I loved that too!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Timely service and great food! Short distance from home, worth the trip. Buy one get one free hot sake!!!"}
{"text":"Cute, small place. Prices are reasonable/average. Our waitress wasn't able to tell us what was in some of the rolls when we asked, not a huge deal. Ordered the kara-Age, Yam, California & dynamite rolls. Kara-Age was delicious, came served with 5 pieces, mayo and Cajun salt dry spice to dip. The California roll was decent, normally sized. The Yam & Dynamite rolls in the other hand were so MASSIVE it was hard to eat a single piece without almost choking or having it completely fall apart in your plate. Taste was good, size, not so good for eating. The only rolls that seemed to be small were the lower prices rolls (veggie) guess the more you pay the bigger it was. Price for the Maki sushi ranged from $2.50(avocado  roll) to just over $11(Spider roll)."}
{"text":"We've been here several times. Always seated in the back room. If they seat you there expect to be forgotten. Orders take about 15 minutes to place, have to ask for utensils, and food comes out at all different times. We will not be back which is unfortunate since its right down the road from our house.  Momo I hope you guys change for your own benefit. Las Vegas isn't far enough away that we won't drive for good service and excellent sushi.


                           ***UPDATE***
2 of 4 members of our party received their food and were done eating before the other 2 received theirs. Not once were we checked on to see if we needed anything or even apologize. Finally had to hunt down the waiter and ask if the other two meals were coming.  I tried to cancel them but they were \"being made right now\"  They boxed up the meals and we took them home.  Not so much as a sorry or care about the situation. 


Do not get seated in the back room."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite lunch spots. They have a lunch platter that you can choose what items you would like. We've never had a bad combination. You also get miso soup with your lunch."}
{"text":"I've been going to MOMO for many years.  It is the closest thing I have to a \"home\" sushi place.  I'm eternally impressed with the quality of the fish and the friendliness of the staff.  We've gotten to know Jhonny (yes, it's spelled that way) the owner and even see him around Henderson, giving it an even more local feel.  The sushi chefs are fairly consistent and are quick to suggest things not on the menu.  We are sushi purists (always prefer sashimi to anything resembling catfood and/or covered in \"yumyum\" sauce!) and usually go in and request \"the best fish you have.\"  This can be dangerous for the wallet at times -- but always results in luscious, large chunks of fish. 

I've grown especially fond of the AJI (spanish mackerel sashimi).  The body of the fish (skeleton, tail & head) are used as a serving plate for the sashimi.  After you are finished, the take the fish body, fry it up, and reserve it to you as a crispy snack."}
{"text":"In town on business and had to have my sushi. Found this place online and headed over. In short, the 2 rolls I had, the galleria and white horse were quite good and the shumai was well made but the service was poor. I was seated at the bar right away and then waited for about 10 minutes to be asked if I wanted a drink. It was not at all busy. It was not even 5 pm. My shumai appetizer was forgotten so it was not provided timely. Sushi Chef was very personable but made one roll and I waited about 15 minutes or more to get the other. Huh? I eat a lot of sushi at a lot of places and they always prepare my rolls and present as a platter. 

Anyway, good food poor service. Pleasant people as well. I might try them again just to see if it was a bad day."}
{"text":"This small Japanese restaurant is hidden in a small bank of restaurants near the corner of Stephanie and Power Center. The food is authentic, reasonably priced and plentiful. Well prepared and presented, the tempura is light and crisp, not greasy. The sushi choices are popular and well known to anyone who frequents sushi bars regularly. The only area to improve is the service. While it is fast and efficient, if the waitresses can inject a little friendliness or even crack a smile, it would greatly improve the diners' experience here."}
{"text":"Great place!! My family of four walked in the same time three big parties walked in. Service was speedy. Food was delicious. We ordered California roll, spicy crab roll, spicy tuna roll, Mexico City roll, Irish  and teriyaki chicken.  All were great!! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent service, beverages and food. Something is always different and a lot of times service is slow because there is always a new untrained waitress. The owner takes tips from the workers and finds it appropriate to yell or cuss at them while customers are present. Very unprofessional. I won't bother going here again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for dinner and once for take out. All three times the sushi is yummy. They have some pretty imaginative rolls. Staff is very friendly, although once our service was very slow and both times eating in the table and benches have been sticky. Let's hope that doesn't have anything to do with how clean their kitchen is."}
{"text":"Sushi was yummy and staff was great!
I had never been before and got the roll that has the cucumber instead of rice. Very yummy!:)"}
{"text":"I had the lunch special. Very reasonable price. My combination was teriyaki salmon and tempura. The rest came with the lunch special. Also not shown in this picture...miso soup. Everything was very delicious. Very busy for lunch. They need to hire another server."}
{"text":"Like coming to this place during lunch and with my co worker, great food! Recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Maybe this place is great for locals/regulars. But as someone who stopped in while visiting based on reviews. I was not impressed.

Service was terrible. I walked in a little after 6 on a Sunday, no aknowledgement of me being there, after about 5 minutes I was finally seated. I decided what I wanted, 10 minutes later someone came over and asked if I wanted a drink. I ordered a drink and before I got a chance to let her know I was ready to order my food she walked away.

..waited another 10 minutes, my water came, plopped on the table and half of the water spilled out of the glass.

Here is our convo of me ordering:
Me: Im ready to order now
Waitress: What do you need now?
Me: Id like to order my dinner
W: OK, do you want *insert her rattling off random things here*
M: No, I just want these two rolls and a small screaming \"o\"
W: You sure you dont want more?
M: No thank you

Seriously.. why are you pushing more food on me. Sorry I wont be that big of a tab since its just one person, but that was tacky.

It took about 25 minutes for my food to come out.

The food was OK, nothing great. I wont come back."}
{"text":"I love the new addition to Boulder! The food and service were amazing . Our food came out quickly and was very fresh tasting . Our waitress was very sweet and helpful. The kiss of fire is probably one of our new favorite rolls. The prices were extremely competitive compared to other places in henderson . Since they're still new, they have a lot of specials running . The house sake made for a great sake bomb . Overall,  it was a great place to get sushi in town."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and both times have thoroughly enjoyed myself. When it comes to sushi, I don't do rolls or fried crap so a place needs to offer something special for me to be impressed. Here are some of the things I've loved...

(1) Service. Both times the service has been great and the chefs have been fairly chatty. I really got to know the guy the last time I went.
(2) Baby Octopus Salad - This dish is just yummy. Healthy strips of baby octopus with sesame seeds and not sure what else but I scarf it down.
(3) Uni shooter. I love an Uni Shooter so if a place offers it I'm in.
(4) Live Shrimp - I first discovered this awesome treat in CA. They cut the live shrimp in front of you and serve you the tail meat. They then take the head, flash fry it, and you eat it. SOOOOOOO sweet and yummy!
(5) They always have specials. I love a place that offers stuff off the menu. It shows they care and are trying to be inventive.

I'm not sure why there are bad reviews but they were all from a while back so maybe things have improved. Of all the places I've been in Las Vegas, outside of say Tao or Yellowtail type places, this is by far my favorite. It definitely makes a happy ending to an afternoon of shopping."}
{"text":"Super excited about having a sushi place in Boulder City.  We enjoyed a couple of rolls and a few rounds of nigiri and it was all very good and very reasonably priced.  I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"One word: Lunch special....wait TWO words. Haha.

Decided to hit up this place cause it's down the street from my work and it was a short lunch for me. Got the lunch special - their lunch special you get: miso soup, salad, and two of the meat items -- I got the chicken teriyaki and tonkatsu. 

I put my order in and had my co-worker pick it up, apparently on their menu, you're supposed to get gyoza, tamago and inari sushi. But I didn't get that. Oh well.

Price is decent and quality is okay. Would come back to try out their rolls."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Their screaming O, ultimate tuna, something wrong... oh! And Garlic Tuna!  I love the server, we are regulars here!"}
{"text":"My friends and I enjoy this place very much! The staff is welcoming and friendly and it is always a good time whenever we come in. Simon is our favorite chef at the sushi bar and the food always tastes excellent!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Momo and Seafood bentos. Tastes good, but I've definitely had just as good or better elsewhere for less $$$. The sushi was messy and poorly put together.

GF says to add that she really liked the age dashi tofu. Yes, I agree. That was good."}
{"text":"Favorite neighborhood spot. Great fish and the wait staff is so sweet always a fave !"}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place in Henderson. We love the sushi chefs & will only eat here when on this side of town."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere as you walk in. You are greeted by smiling staff. Seemed pretty busy in the dining area for a Sunday night. I placed an order to go and it was already waiting for me when I got there. My kids love California Rolls so I ordered five. The rolls tasted very fresh. The kids give this place two thumbs up! Will visit again."}
{"text":"Great place with great sushi and service. Came here with my girlfriend, we usually do the all you can eat places. This was extraordinary compared to all the sushi places we've had around here in Las Vegas. Love the vibe and food; definitely recommend it! Niki served us and was super friendly and helped us out."}
{"text":"Just got takeout from here. I got the rock and roll, Irish, and stuffed tomato. A little spicier than most places, but still super good. Fresh fish and cucumber. I was here one other tomw but all i got was a cucumber salad and miso soup. Both delicious. Miso soup was amazing. I stood at the door for a while while everyone kind of looked at me, then a sushi chef yelled \"CUSTOMER!!!\" and everyone came up to me at once. There was a woman helping a little girl with math at one of the tables. Guessing it's a family owned joint. The sushi was delicious though, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great sushi !!Nicky our waitress was very sweet !!food was great and fresh.The fish was excellent and was able to try new items.."}
{"text":"We come to Momo's for dinner at least twice a month.  The food is great, the sushi fresh and the staff friendly.  Our go to Japanese restaurant!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Great food (I love their ice cream) and very personable staff. I know some have complained about the service being slow, which has never seemed to bother me, but it is absolutely worth the wait! 5 stars."}
{"text":"I frequently come here when I visit my parents in Henderson and usually get take out. Great service, love their menu and fish is fresh and delicious! Would highly recommend if you are in the Henderson area looking for some good sushi!"}
{"text":"This place is a whole in the wall. Food is fresh and of very good quality. Nikki was our waitress and she was awesome....she made sure everything was good with our food abs accommodated every single wired request we had. Only thing that some people might not like is that it's not an all you can eat place! Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"we tried this place based on reviews.  we already love sumo sushi over on green valley and wanted to see if this place measured up.  nope.  didn't cut it.  good but not great.  went there trhee times to make sure but we'll stick to sumo for our love of sushi!"}
{"text":"The sushi is fresh and yummy! I've been here many times and the staff are always pleasant and the sushi is consistently scrumptious! Although this place does not have ayce it still should not be overlooked as a sushi option! If anything, the reason why their quality of fish is better than a lot of other place is because it does not have ayce. I would go here everytime for sushi but it's in Henderson and I live in Vegas. 

The interior is well decorated and has a calming vibe, a cute place to bring a date for sure. Imo this is probably one of the best places in town. The prices are reasonable, the fish is quality, and try the jesty salmon roll! ^_^"}
{"text":"The sushi was really high quality along with their beef and chicken. The wait staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely love it! best sushi I've had in Las vegas so far! Big, hearty rolls, i love it and make an effort to get down there weekly, i live in summerlin but it's worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at Momo's because of the great reviews and was not disappointed. The miso soup was great, followed by the Henry and Orion rolls. Will definitely come by here again next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"While running errands on a Saturday afternoon, my boyfriend and I stopped here for lunch. It was relatively slow/empty, but had great reviews on yelp, so we decided to give it a shot!  

The most important thing to mention is that almost all of their rolls feature crab mix, which I don't eat.  If you're like me, this place is not for you. If they are not busy, they will customize, but I get embarrassed when I have to do that.  We ordered two rolls and they were just okay; their sushi rice is kinda bland compared to others.  If you want awesome sushi, go to Tokyo Boys down the street."}
{"text":"We love it here. The atmosphere it here amazing. The staff is really nice. The sushi is spectacular. We are regulars now!!!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue...
So my boyfriend and I decided to try this place on a whim early last year...and we were pleasantly surprised! 
The food is fresh and delicious! We had the Ugly Roll, Screaming Honey, Palm-tree Roll, Sex on the Beach, Something Wrong 69, and When Shrimp Meets Crab. I would give the food 5 stars. The service, I would give 3.5 stars. The atmosphere, 3.5 stars as well. The waitresses are a little pushy and seem to rush you out as soon as you're done eating. The establishment itself is a little too dim for my liking and it's a little sloppy looking in my opinion - it looks more like someone's house rather than a restaurant. But overall, I would recommend this place for sushi if you're in the Green Valley area! We've been back multiple times ever since our first visit!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, good service, highly recommended! Our server was attentive and courteous. The chef was very engaging, the restaurant was clean and overall, people seemed to enjoy themselves. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"The sushi is ok, but nothing special. The spicy edamame is not good! It is so salty it is inedible. The waitresses greet you and serve promptly, but they pick up the dishes with the same velocity! I felt rushed and as if I was being kicked out. I don't know if I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Normally I always go to \"all you can eat\" sushi places only because I like to go and try different rolls. I went to Momos (which does not offer all you can eat and I knew that before going) and WOW what a difference it was from AYCE sushi. The service was amazing and the waitresses always made sure you had water and anything else you needed without being too clingy to the table and trying to get you in and out. The food was delicious and everything the waiter recommended was sooo good! The baked mussels were my favorite but even all of the rolls we had tasted so good! I would HIGHLY recommend this place and will definitely be back soon! It was worth paying more for the taste!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I got to watch shrimp get drunk in a glass of sake... Literally 2 huge live shrimps in a glass filled with sake splashing around... Super interesting. The rolls are great. Service is great. All around awesome experience. We will go back. If you're in the area give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Overall good service good food at a reasonable price. Everything was really good the Oriental box was amazing"}
{"text":"This is one of the very best sushi restaurants I've ever been to. The fish is cut so beautifully, your teeth sink right in. The portions are very generous. There aren't a million rolls to choose from but what they do offer is delicious and fresh. We always get the salmon Kama too! This dish takes about a half hour to get to our table but it is so worth the wait. Crispy, fatty and oh so tasty! Taylor is an amazing and intuitive server who will make suggestions for you if you like. It's my favorite restaurant in Boulder City."}
{"text":"Very good food I eat here often, hot & cold dishes. A friendly staff always gives a rousing \"konnichiwa\"\" or \"konbonwa\" (good afternoon or evening) as you enter.  The atmosphere is great - once inside it's easy to forget about the outside world as the windows are tinted dark and Japanese screens hide the parking lot.  The decor is warm and traditional.  There is a nice flat screen behind the sushi bar that doesn't interfere and usually plays sports."}
{"text":"Overall excellent experience, especially for Henderson. Nigiri was fresh and specialty rolls were delicious and unique, we had some of both. Service was excellent and we were well taken care of. Price was average for the area, but in my opinion about 1-2 dollars too high across the board. I strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"Momo Sushi is always a good choice for lunch. Stopped in over the weekend and had a roll with some bento boxes. Everything was delicious as usual. We will be back again for lunch. Never been here for dinner but perhaps we will come in sometime to try."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious sushi and sashimi. I really love the ikura here. I think they marinate it so it has nice soy flavor that pairs well with the saltiness of the balls in your mouth. Heehee. They have complimentary cucumber salad when you sit at sushi bar. 

If you head there for lunch you can get a 2 choice bento box for under 9 bucks. I always get salmon teriyaki and tempura combo. So tasty! They have lots to choose from. Comes with miso soup, gyoza, salad and rice.

Highly recommended if you're in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place around! Mexico City roll is my go to! Their menu has pictures of all the rolls and helps if you aren't sure what you are getting yourself into with unique rolls."}
{"text":"I called to see if this place is \"Japanese\" owned and asked TWICE. The girl responded YES TWICE. Well, she LIED! I was pretty pissed and after we left, I gave a $3 tip (dollar per person).
I don't appreciate when people lie as it was Korean owned and they don't have the knowledge to cook Japanese food. Of course, most people don't know the difference between Japanese and Korean (except for Asians). And on top of that you can tell by the atmosphere that it's not Japanese....Never again......."}
{"text":"Bombtastic! 3 alarm FIRE roll disgustingly good. Kiss of fire sexieness! Dont worry is bomb bomb. Irish roll sooooo my goodness! Sushi chef was delightful friendly. Waitress sweet n on it! Will return asap"}
{"text":"The sushi was good, but the waitress never came back to check if we needed anything else. We placed our empty glasses to get a refill but they we not paying attention. I don't recommend this place because the service was awful."}
{"text":"Sushi was good.  Service was lacking.  They had many interesting rolls to choose from.  We picked about 8-10 rolls.  We way over ordered.  It worked out though because a couple of our rolls never came.  They eventually got taken off the bill.  The only time our server came around was to rush us.  Never when we actually needed something like refills or forgotten rolls.  We felt rushed the whole time we were there.  There were other open tables and we were still eating so I'm not sure what the big deal was.  They have lunch specials that look pretty good.  I would go back to try that if I was in the area but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best tasting best quality sushi in this area. Environment is clean. Staff is efficient service is good. Prices are a little high but you get what you pay for and it's worth it. Lunch specials are really worth coming in for."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat good food good service great sushi. Try the Momo box it's wonderful"}
{"text":"Finally!! We don't have to leave Boulder City to get good sushi. Awesome food and an amazing staff!"}
{"text":"Meh, totally forgettable. I've had much worse and much better. If your in a pinch come here, but was hesitant to consume raw fish."}
{"text":"Like what some other reviewers have said, service here is pretty spotty. We were only a party of 2 so as long as we had our waters and orders correct, that's all I cared about. Pretty much you come in, place your order, they give you your food, you eat, pay for your bill and leave.
Sure, the spicy tuna rolls and this other sushi roll my friend and I ordered were delicious but damn...the price was pretty expensive. $10-12 for spicy tuna rolls!? Come on now.... Then again...look at where Momo Sushi is located at: Henderson. There are plenty of other sushi places especially on the West side/Chinatown that have better prices.

The only reason why we came here for lunch was because we were in the area and we were craving for sushi."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and found that they are top of the line in making sushi.  It was one of the best sushi restaurants I have ever been in.  So yummy."}
{"text":"It's my second time to  joined this place.  First time was 16 years ago, when there was only few places in Vegas that serves Japanese food.  I'm so disappointed, this time.  Everything I ate this time was no good.  I'm pretty sure it was not my not my taste buds. I had AYE sushi. Tried the sushi which I think that are salable but didn't like it at all!  The calamari looks like tofu and rubbery.  Service was ok."}
{"text":"The service was horrible!  We were the only table and got decent service then a crowd of rowdy women came in and we were nonexistent.  It took us over 30 min to get our check and that was after I  had to walk up to the front counter. 
The food was decent but will probably not go back. I don't like to be in an establishment where I'm treated like I'm a bother than welcomed. 
Being a prior food server I was very disappointed at the quality of service."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Sushi and service is fabulous. A must if you are a sushi lover"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service and they're fast! Every thing came fast and sushi tasted very fresh! !"}
{"text":"The service at this place is awful. The hosts/servers don't seem to know how to communicate or know what they are doing. I asked them for a table 3 times and each time they tried sitting me at the bar. It's like they forgot they had already spoken to me and I was the only one waiting for a table. Then a different group came in and they tried sitting them before us. Both I and the other group had to inform them that my group was waiting first. They need a better system to sit people. They also got our food orders wrong. The sushi is good but I probably won't be going there anymore because it's not worth the hassle of dealing with the host/servers."}
{"text":"So bummed. I used to love this place, it's right by me and I used to go all the time. Haven't been in months so we went again and it was no bueno. The rice was mushy and the rolls, I don't know, just not like they used to be. It's a shame, and I hope it was a fluke, but the most recent time was not great."}
{"text":"Get the Screaming Orgasm!!! The best! And most awkward recommendation ever. Everything was good and fairly priced. Friendly staff. One of the best sushi joints I've ever been to and I'm from LA."}
{"text":"Moved here from CA about a year ago, and have been trying to find great sushi since we got here- we finally found it! We have tried lots of places, even tried AYCE, and were not impressed until we tried Momo. Started with a few sashimi plates to see how fresh the fish was, and wow was it fresh!  We then tried a couple rolls and some simple sushi and it was all really good. Can't wait to go back! Our server Maria was fantastic too."}
{"text":"Love this place. They don't have the typical all you can eat but the quality of every roll is so good it doesn't matter. The chefs are pretty cool and it's a pretty decent place to watch a game at their bar."}
{"text":"I'll admit that I was skeptical about finding good sushi in the desert :) but this was pretty darn great.  First off the menu is so entertaining!! It had things like the 'Heart Attack' roll and the 'Screaming Orgasm'.  I had two rolls that were both delicious and fresh tasting. My friends also cleared their plates and everything I tasted of theirs was awesome.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the service was kind of hit or miss. Our food arrived in strange orders - like our appetizer was almost the last thing to arrive and our rolls came out so that some of us were eating and other weren't.  Overall, a great place and I can overlook the service because the food was so tasty."}
{"text":"We visited this place on Boxing Day, despite our attempts to get into Globefish @ Chinook.

We were immediately greeted and seated by a couple of friendly waitresses. They were very quick and prompt with their service.

The menu at Momo Sushi had the average items you would see in most sushi restaurants, nothing special jumped out at me when I saw it. The prices were average, much like if you went to other sushi joints along MacLoed Trail.

I ordered some nigiri-zushi and a California roll, and finished with a couple bowls of refreshing miso soup. The sushi was fresh enough for me to eat it with very little to no soy sauce, but wasn't inspiring enough for me to compare it to the sushi I've had at other places. Finally I finished my meal with green tea ice cream, which doesn't get any better or worse in this city.

Overall Momo sushi hits the spot if one was looking for a simple and filling meal after a day of shopping. I just wish that they had their own special rolls that stood out or a \"freshest fish\" menu like Wa's has. It feels like they need to put on a leather jacket and scream \"forget those clowns across the street! come party with us!!\""}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Been coming here for years. Always happy with the outcome. Fresh seafood and the staff is always on point."}
{"text":"Momo Sushi has taken over as the only place I find worth spending my hard earned money at to eat. Between the amazing cuts of fish, beyond exceptional customer service and very reasonable prices, I can't talk myself into going anywhere else when I go out to eat. The amount of personal attention received every time I visit keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"went here for the first time and enjoyed several of their rolls. not Bad. My problem is that I was there to relax and eat sushi. There was maybe 5 or 6 older guys in there getting pretty drunk at the sushi bar and then entered a loud and drunk woman. They all started hitting on her, got shot down and then left. Then the woman announced her sexual preference (which does not bother me)  and announced very loudly to a couple at the bar that she was going to get the girl (the one on the date) before the guy would. I am very far from being a prude or shy but this became very awkward. I thought that the 3 guys behind the bar would stop it, but did not. Hopefully, this was an isolated thing because I'd like to go there and relax. Sorry, do not know the results of the showdown. LOL!"}
{"text":"Itz tiny,  but our family likes it. Great sushi & VERY fresh sashimi. Yum! Your Yelp check in will get you a scoop of green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the lunch special. It's a lot of sushi for a very reasonable price. I also got a free dessert for checking in, which I love. Red bean ice cream - my favorite! We tried the saké and the Japanese beer. I love places that offer authentic tastes of their culture."}
{"text":"First time here today, and it was good! Will be back for sure! California rolls are only 5$ and they are super good, we also had the crazy roll which is shrimp tempura with eel sauce and white fish"}
{"text":"I visited here for the first time recently, I was impressed with the flavors of the rolls and the quality of the food. The atmosphere is a bit lacking, and I felt the price was too high. Overall it's a very good place for sushi, but you can definitely get the same quality for a better price."}
{"text":"Was actually surprised that being across the road from chinook more people don't know about this but I guess it's the parking etc that makes it a bit tricky . Nice and quiet and good combo rolls . The pieces of sushi are larger then most in town . The prices are average . The sushi chefs even welcome you and say goodbye . The service is great and stylish"}
{"text":"If the fish is gray throw it away, I think they said this at the OJ Simpson trial, but the same sentiment should be said here. YUCK! Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I am going here Saturday night with the 'rents. So I will write more about this place later but this review will be on the 3 times in the past I've been here.  This place is freakin' awesome :)  Staff - friendly, fast: food - fresh, amazing ;)
These people have it down!  They have this particular roll I love but I cannot remember the name (Tina's fatty roll??)  when I eat there Sat I'll (of course) get it & write about it some more ;)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Damn parents & I didn't go on Sat so I'll never get the name of that roll!!!  WAHHHHH!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Las Vegas. Everything is always super fresh and delicious. We go here for all our special occasions. My favorite is the Hawaiian roll and Marcs roll"}
{"text":"Great service, menu and variety. The sushi is fresh and always delicious. My go to place for sushi in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"Awesome, unexpected spot that has good quality sushi and drinks. Went here with my wife for a little lunch date and enjoyed the food, drinks and staff, very much. We have been back for dinner on several occasions with our son who is into sushi and he gave it a thumbs up.

Fortunately, every time we have returned, we haven't had the issues that other reviewers have had. I would recommend this spot for a sushi and sake fix. We look forward to returning."}
{"text":"This little place has excellent sushi rolls. The rolls are large and fluffy, melt in your mouth. The prices are compatible with similar sushi places in Vegas except the rolls are actually really good and fresh. The chef is a master sushi chef that knows how to roll with care. The service is fast, the staff are friendly, and the portions are just right. If I ever come back to Vegas I would drive down just for a sushi roll."}
{"text":"Best Sushi place in all of Henderson!  There fish is the freshest I have eaten in the middle of the desert with no \"fishy\" taste at all!   If your new to sushi go with the Screaming O and a triple A roll.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite sushi place. They treat us like family here! Love you guys! I highly recommend the hooters roll. Amazing quality"}
{"text":"I decided to have sushi again after being pregnant for 9 long months, so I decided to give this joint a try since it was close to home. The atmosphere is chill & our waitress was very helpful. I tried two of their special rolls, the kiss of fire and Johnny Roll. The kiss of fire roll was good, but it lacked heat in which I was really looking forward too. I've had the kiss of fire roll from Sakana sushi, so I was expecting some good heat from Momo's version , after all it is called the \"Kiss of Fire\" right???? The Johnny Roll was good as well. Other than the above, overall it was a good restaurant and the rolls are a good sized portion, so I can't really complain."}
{"text":"Where the heck did the 5 stars come from? Either shill posts or those that know no better. 

Quaint little place. Greeted promptly, nice enough waitress.

I paid $13.95 for one roll plus an extra cheezy dollar to swap a few razor thin slices of questionable tuna out for razor thin questionable salmon on a roll after the waitress asked the \"boss\" if they needed to up-charge for the substitution. I would have given him $5 if he is hurting that bad. 

My sushi chef did a good job with what he had to work with and put it up quickly. The wasabi was totally bland. The poor guy looked like someone put an anchor on his heart. Could be the \"boss\" or the somber environment or maybe just nap time.  

Nigiri and roll pricing is exorbitant and the inventory in the cold case was sparse....and questionable. You can't charge super premium prices on Nigiri and serve shoddy proteins. 

Boulder City can be fickle....if enough folks get turned off, and you can't make it on the few and far between travelers...guess what? You're toast, that's what. 

I would drive to Vegas in rush hour and pay more for a decent cut. Never again!"}
{"text":"Shrimp Tempura udon and Screaming Orgasm (yikes that felt awkward typing).  Shrimp Tempura great size for the price (9.95).  Only problem I found is the tempura is placed in the soup prior to arriving at the table, and therefore it was soggy and was falling apart.  Screaming Orgasm has a small and a large option, and comes on a bed of shredded radish (daikon).  Heavy sauce but it gives it a good flavor.  Overall the service is quick, but there were two times that the communication fell apart and two items did not make it to our table without a reminder that we were waiting for items.  If you get your items and are missing anything, it is best to just assume they may have forgotten or communication broke down, so give a friendly reminder.  They did not react rudely or condescending; very apologetic and moved with haste to get it to us.

Pictured:  Jhonny's Special Roll (ordered by someone in our party.  And yes, the spelling is what was on the menu)."}
{"text":"Came in at about 7 p.m. and got seated right away.

The waitress was nice and very attentive to us, we hadn't been in before so she explained the menu and answered our questions.

The food quality was really good, the portions were fair for the prices, and everything was ideal."}
{"text":"GREAT sushi. HORRIBLE service! The waiter spilled water all over our table and after coming to our table three times after that I had to ask him to please wipe it down or bring me napkins for me to do it. If you want good sushi, but do not mind bad service this is the place for you."}
{"text":"It was decent and not crowded. The quality is good, the service a bit slow. We at at the Bar and chef was attentive. He even made the crab nigiri we asked for. I gave it two stars because there are others that, when I eat sushi, I can't stop saying \"mm\". This place didn't have that oomph for me, unfortunately."}
{"text":"5 starts for the food, everything was amazing, fresh and delicious. Is not overpriced and they have a lot of tasty options. The service could be better, we had to be waiting and waving to the waitress to get their attention. They forgot some stuff in our order but it wasn't a big deal since everything else was really good. 
I just happened to check in and I discovered a coupon on yelp, when I mentioned it to the server she didn't seem happy about it. The food was so goo that I will go back again and again and won't care about the service :) I can keep getting my own napkins, plates etc from other tables."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!  Fresh food, friendly and fun staff, and then there is the Ultimate Tuna Roll...the best thing I have ever eaten.  Ever.  Anywhere. They have a big variety of rolls to choose from, so finding something that calls to you isn't hard to do...not over-eating is the hard part."}
{"text":"We have tried a few sushi restaurants in the Henderson area since it's nice and close to Boulder City.  The best by far is Momo's.  The staff is so friendly, every roll we have had is fresh and flavorful.  We keep trying others, but none of them exceed the quality of Momo's."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! The food is excellent and the prices are great! We love Megun one of the servers there. She knows us by name and remembers what we drink even though we only eat there maybe once a month. Love this place!"}
{"text":"First time here, giving Momo Sushi five stars, great sushi great service, good price..."}
{"text":"Hidden little gem! Was out in Boulder City for a class and decided to check out a local spot before heading back into town. Prices are great, Sushi was excellent, Tempura was excellent, very crowded and not much space in the place but we now know why. Will definitely stop by again when we are in BC! You should bring this to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great little gem, absolutely awesome sushi. Had the Screaming O, Tara's Fatty Roll and s yellow tail steak. Fantastic, you gotta try this place."}
{"text":"First customers at the new boulder city location. And everything was awesome. Very happy man"}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi you'll find in Henderson in my personal opinion. Quick fast service, friendly people, great vibe when you eat indoors at the location. It's dark and cozy with great decor. The specialty rolls are delicious and good quality of fish."}
{"text":"Works of edible art are served here. I recommend the Somethings Wrong. The blend of tuna, salmon, crab, and shrimp are perfect. It is served with a delicate sauce that enhances the experience. The wait staff and chefs are friendly and efficient! We will definitely do this again soon!"}
{"text":"I Love this place and our chef Jay! Ask for the Toro sashimi and the poke salad. We always have fun!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed every bit of dishes at Momo:) Tonkatsu and beef steak were so delicious, and the price was very reasonable.  I'd like to come here to eat Japanese food!!!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here but it has now been declared our new sushi spot! It was absolutely delicious! Sit at the bar and ask for Eric! He was a really cool dude and took good care of us. Food was great and service was awesome! I definitely recommend it. Stop reading this review and just go!! Lol"}
{"text":"Being hundreds of miles from the ocean I was not expecting great sushi and I was pleasantly surprised. The quality of their sushi at this restaurant is by far some of the best I've ever had. The service was incredible and they had a wide variety of really original rolls with very unique flavors. It's tucked away in old town Boulder so you will need directions. It's a small restaurant with seating for 20-30 maybe. The decor could use a little refresh. But it's clean and very well kept. Their Sushí is really exceptional. Enough that I would consider making the drive from the Vegas strip especially if it was a busy weekend or visit the Hoover Dam and stop for dinner on the way back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my friend because we were craving sushi and it was close to where we live. The food was good but the service...not so much. We walked in and the waitress asked how many and seated us at the bar, did not really smile at us or act friendly. I got a vibe that they were tired and wanted to go home. The next two people that walked in must of been regulars because the sushi chefs and waitresses immediately acknowledged them and said hello... Um, ok.

Anyhoo on the food...   I cannot complain about it,  it was really yummy. I got the Ninja box (teriyaki beef, shrimp/veggie tempura, spicy tuna roll (4 pieces) and some kind of dumpling?  Also came with salad and miso soup. My friend ordered the Jen 2 roll and the soft shell crab appetizer, she said both of them were good. 

Pro's - Food was great, restaurant is small and cozy, large sushi bar space to eat (hate rubbing elbows with my neighbor)

Con's - Bitchy waitstaff, never asked us if we wanted a refill on our drinks even though they charged us almost $3 for a coke, the prices on the sushi rolls here are pretty expensive and they don't have AYCE, booo."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's a little pricey compared to other sushi places around town. But nonetheless it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Great service & great sushi. Everyone was very happy & friendly. Nikki was our waitress she was very fast and made us feel welcome. Overall me & my boyfriend were very pleased. Definitely will be coming back (:"}
{"text":"Intimate atmosphere & friendly staff. More than just sushi on the menu... rice bowls, chicken teriyaki,  gyoza, etc. I was hoping for more traditional sushi choices, so it was hard to find rolls without cream cheese and crazy sauces. But they have creative specials & would be good for more adventurous sushi lovers. I got a tekka maki roll (tuna), sake (salmon on a ball of rice), & miso soup. Yummy sushi,  but I'm going to keep looking for somewhere more authentic."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for lunch. They have a bento special or a sushi special. Cheap and fast!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Have both ate in and ordered out.  Always do great job on food.  It is a little more than a few other sushi places, but keep going back cause worth the few extra bucks.  Always get the Triple A Roll and edamame."}
{"text":"really good... very reasonable prices... service was kind of all over the place though... but great food!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place it used to be my favorite sushi place for a long a time, came for dinner last night and the food was not good at all, the service was horrible. Our waitress took my order wrong, I was served a roll I did not order and when I called the waitress to let her know I was served something I did not order she literally started arguing with me saying that's the roll I had ordered, she then turns around says something to one of the sushi chefs in their language and they all start laughing it was actually very rude! I WILL NOT COME BACK again, the food I wouldn't mind giving it another shot since I know how good their food can be but the way I was treated and the service provided is completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"I'm actually pretty surprised this place has 4 stars. let me start off by saying I did go close to closing so that might have had a part into my bad experience. anyways, I went there probably a week ago and the sushi was just alright, nothing special.  Soft shell crab was no bueno."}
{"text":"went in and sat at the bar the sushi chef let me know as soon i sat down it would be a couple of minutes before he could start my order. . . . .. i had about 3 generous servings of handrolls. . . . great service, my water was always filled, the staff was extremely nice.  would recommend if your by sunset station"}
{"text":"I hardly ever leave a review, or give 1 star. But the food was Really bad! Quality sucked, service sucked, prices were high."}
{"text":"The lunch special is such a good deal. It seems like the portion is so small, however, it really does fill you up. The salad and miso soup on the side was very tasty. I ordered the beef teryaki and it was very chewy. In addition to the food being great, the servers were very kind and welcoming. The atmosphere of the place is clean and petite as well. They also have a sushi bar area. Other than that, i enjoyed lunch. I look forward to trying their other dishes. Oh, they also serve free ice cream when you check in on Yelp! So don't forget to check in :)"}
{"text":"Ahhh Momo...how I love thee.  This place has sentimental value to me (my boyfriend took me here on our first date, which happened to be Valentine's Day as well).  The sushi is really good, it's not a showy place like Kabuki, Sushi Roku, etc., and if you're an Uni person (like my bf), they don't always have Uni, but supposedly Uni is not always in season.  With that being said, I really do like Momo, you can't go wrong with any of their rolls and it is not expensive at all.  The sushi chefs are very funny and friendly too (if you sit at the bar, they will take a shot of sake with you). The Screaming Orgasm has got to be my favorite.  Oh and the sushi one isn't bad neither."}
{"text":"My first time eating sushi. Decided to come here after i read such good reviews. Let me tell you, this place is a must try place! I highly recommend this to everyone. The service is excellent! No complaints at all. Expect me to come here very often"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi,  service and laid back feel.  Good cooks,  great unfiltered saki.  Small but nice."}
{"text":"I have yet to have bad service here. As a regular sometimes you expect an off night. So far, it's been amazing. The quality of sushi is great, the guys here won't serve anything they don't like. And have always been up front on what's fresh etc. 
   If you like Sashimi and you like it a bit spicy, then definitely try the Momo Hamachi appetizer. Its def one of my favorites. Perfectly sliced pieces of Hamachi, with a leaf of cilantro, and a thin slice of a jalapeno with a drop of sriracha...and Yuzu sauce  (kind of a citrucy flavor) And after enjoying this, I usually get the Kiss of fire roll, and ask if they Have Sake Kama ( salmon collar ).  
   Over all the atmosphere and staff are good. Its not overly loud, and the inside styling is like most pacific rim Japanese restaurants. 
   There are other great rolls and cooked fare as well. Just have a look at their menu.

{"text":"The sushi was some of the best I've had in town, however the service was AWFUL. Also, they do not have AYCE, but that doesn't affect my review."}
{"text":"The sushi rolls were very good. We got some rolls and a bento box. The bento box was huge but the chicken that we ordered was very dry and had no flavor. Besides the sushi which is always good I wouldn't order the teriyaki chicken again."}
{"text":"Went here because it was one of the few stores still open at 10 p.m. I got the Ninja box for about $15-16 which was not TOO pricy for a bento box dinner set. The set came with 3 pieces of shumai, a california roll (4 pieces?), salmon, vegetable and shrimp tempura, rice, and miso soup. The quality of everything was good, but nothing really stood out to me. I probably wouldn't go back since I have discovered some other pretty good sushi places which are either slightly comparable in price or even a little cheaper. If you are craving for sushi and are around the area, I'd say give it a try."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here for my birthday and I have to say I was impressed! Upon entering, I was a little surprised by the size of the place, it's small...VERY small, but they made up for the size in a BIG way with outstanding sushi and fantastic service. We especially enjoyed the Salmon Kama (Broiled Salmon Collar) and sake as we look over the menu and ultimately decided to let the chef do his magic  for us. Every roll was delicious, delicate and filled with flavor. At the end of the meal I was treated (on the house) to green tea ice cream and the entire place (which was full) sang happy birthday to me! Well worth going to!!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I have had better sushi at other places though, but this location is very close to my house so I come here once in awhile to take care of any sushi cravings. The terrikai chicken bowl was pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Momo Yama Roll, Mexico City, Screaming Orgasim & Marc's Roll are my top pics at the time being. Johnny, the owner is hilarious and always willing to have some sake if you sit at the bar. :-) Clean establishment with a fun crowd and great staff."}
{"text":"Came here when my friend and I finished shopping at nordstorm rack. It was our first time in momoyama, our first thought was \"its gonna be japanese fast food\" coz it did look like one. However, when we got in we were amazed. The inside was actually pretty. Prices were inexpensive, rolls were around 7 - 12 dollars. We got three rolls and 2 appetizers, the appetizers were SMALL. However, the specialty rolls were all good. I highly recommend coming to momoyama after your day at galleria mall or nordstorm rack!

Now I am a fan of your specialty rolls and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is my husband and I's FAVORITE sushi place by far. They have so many options, sauces, etcetera. Their fish is always so fresh and delicious! The waitresses' are so attentive and have amazing customer service. I HIGHLY recommend this place, I wish I could give it 100 stars."}
{"text":"I really like this little place. It is hidden away in the retail hell of Stephanie Street down by the Sunset Station, but it is worth finding. Hit them on either Friday or over the weekend. I have been told that they get their fresh fish order on Friday and they tend to run out of some items as the week goes on. The Sushi is good and presented well with style and subdued beauty. They do not hide the flavor of their sushi with too much sauce, but instead rely on the quality of their fish and their work. They are quick and efficient. They have always been quick and efficient every visit I have made. My drink is never empty and a dirty dish does not sit on the table long.

They don't have an all you can eat so going on a sushi binge can get pricey. However, they do have a specials board behind the bar. I strongly urge you to take advantage of the specials as I have never been disappointed by them. They usually have a halibut sushi on the specials list that I simply love. Be brave when ordering because they have some pretty unique creations. Food courage is the most rewarding courage of all. 

I sadly can't give them five stars because their was a sushi place I went to all the time in North Carolina which IMO is the best sushi I have ever had. It has simply ruined me and all other sushi I eat I compare to that place. Sadly, nothing has ever lived up to their quality, but Momo comes pretty darn close. I wouldn't say it's worth a trip across town, but if you are in the southeast of Vegas for any reason over the weekend, this is must. And tell Momo I said hi...
(I don't know who the hell Momo is or even if there is a Momo, but a dare you to walk in and say \"Doc says to tell Momo hi.\")"}
{"text":"This place is on point for the food, service and design. The food was amazing!!! I had 8 different rolls and all of them were amazing! They were very friendly and were very attentive even when the whole place was slammed. I was very very impressed with the hospitality and food. I would definitely recommend the place to come and eat."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Vegas! I love coming here- great atmosphere!

The Irish roll is the best roll ever!"}
{"text":"Eric and the friendly staff were amazing!! Very good portions and incredible taste!! Great atmosphere and decor as well :) I had the Alaska roll and order of baked muscles and I enjoyed every bite! Go check out Momo!!"}
{"text":"I agree with Micheal H who said \"consistently awesome sushi\" and C.J. who wrote \"it's not a showy place like Sushi Roku..etc.\" I don't eat bento boxes, so I would take other Yelper's word on those. But as far as sushi goes, it's my favorite place in this area. I've been a regular here for since 2005.

I always order the Momo Yellowtail Sashimi special. At $12-14 it's not that great of a deal but they serve it with more fish than other places; the yellowtail is cut perfectly and covered with the right amount of citrus sauce, jalapeno and cilantro. Sen of Japan adds a crispy topping to this dish that I like, but they charge a little more too.

All other rolls are great. The Rebecca used to be a favorite. I also like the Irish Roll.

Service can be a little slow when they're busy but the wait staff are very nice and work hard."}
{"text":"I dropped  $200 a week for 4 months , and they had the balls to charge me .50 cents for ponzu sauce & .50 cents for sriracha sauce , why not just install a coin operated bathroom , 10 cents a napkin . I liked the place  5 minute walk from my house , Taylor was fantastic . A customer is  essential , why loose one ,( back to my favorite ) \" THE SUSHI \""}
{"text":"Worker there highly recommended Momo Sushi.  Tasty and fresh sushi. Service was great n friendly. Price was reasonable."}
{"text":"A whole menu of creative and interesting sushi rolls. And alot of them have pictures, and pictures are always good. I had the Judy roll and the Irish roll for lunch yesterday. I cant remember what was in them, but they were both good. I just randomly picked them because I liked the names. Although, I cant figure out how they came up with the names...especially the Irish roll? It wasnt even green?  I'd go back...in fact I'm going to have to so I can ask more questions about the names...I need to get to the bottom of this."}
{"text":"Food and service are both mediocre.

Came here for lunch one day and ordered a bunch of stuff to share. The prices are high for this area, and the food didn't taste all that great. The quality of fish for the sushi is decent but generally not a good cut of fish. The hamachi was a bit stiff and stringy. We did get the Sushi boat to share and that thing was huge for $50. Our bill was pretty high and we didn't feel like we got a lot of food. 

The rolls were ok. Service was ok, pretty mediocre. 

I think I'd get the same quality if not better quality at an AYCE place down the street. Most likely not coming back."}
{"text":"great sushi, great alternative if you do not want to do AYCE"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, price is very reasonable and service is speedy and great. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Well, it's official guys!  I can finally stop staying \"there's no good Japanese places near me in Henderson!\"  cause this place was damn good! haha. Now I don't know if my palate has changed (highly doubt that) but the spicy tuna was so damn good!  It had the perfect blend of flavors with the right amount of kick, if you know what I mean!  And if you want to go for a big bang, you can get it extra spicy! =D  

I ordered the salmon skin salad, Orion Roll and the Jesty Roll.

Salmon Skin Salad:  Mmmm...the skin was crispy!  And the dressing was good!  None of that soggy salmon skin crap you get at some places.  Highly recommended! =)  

Orion Roll:  Momo's edition of spicy tuna roll topped with albacore tuna and drizzled with a garlic sauce.  Very delicious!  Rice was perfect, not too mushy, and not too undercooked!  Yum!!  

Jesty Roll:  Salmon rolled in masago, rolled up in rice, topped with more salmon and a thinly sliced lemon!  Super good for that refreshing taste you sometimes crave! =)  

The only down side to this place is it is a bit pricey.  I was bit upset at first, but once that spicy tuna hit my taste buds, they were dancing with joy and the price didn't matter anymore! haha.  

Check it out guys! =)"}
{"text":"Very delicious food! Consider to be authentic Japanese kind. We are vegas travelers just happen to be nearby, what a lucky find! I recommend crazy horse sushi, udon, fried tofu, their salad is also great with homemade dressing."}
{"text":"I have lived in Vegas for 6 years and I never found a sushi restaurant I loved until my friend Lucas brought me here. 

Ditch the low quality all you can eat sushi and come here if you want good and fresh quality fish. 

We sat at the bar and James and Eric was our sushi chef. Fantastic and great chefs and I love when they give recommendations. Complimentary cucumber salad was brought out along with the usual ginger and wasabi. 

What to order
Hamachi sashimi with a jalapeño and a hint of Siracha. Not too spicy and the right amount of citrus. 

Toro: By far my favorite nigiri - the fatty tuna belly. Most places don't have this and I didn't see it on the menu so just ask for it!

Uni shooter: Came in a martini glass. I'm a huge fan of uni. 

Spicy halibut: with a hint of siracha and green onion. 

Also here's a tip. Ask James for his \"Happy Orange\" dessert. *hint hint wink wink. It's actually quite clever. 

5 stars for service and food."}
{"text":"MOMO is the spot for some great sushi! Get the Irish role!! Anything you get, will be awesome!"}
{"text":"Every time we go we're never disappointed.  The sushi chefs are always obliged to make off menu goodies depending on what we're in the mood.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My Lord! I love Mono Sushi and now we have one here in Boulder City."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite sushi bar in Henderson. I've been coming here twice a month for the past year and it never disappoints. Johnny and Simon always take excellent care of my family at the sushi bar. Must try items are the momo kanpachi special, white tuna paradise, live shrimp and fresh spicy halibut."}
{"text":"This place is a-frickin-mazing! I had the momo kampachi, and it was probably the best sashimi I have ever had. Definitely give this place a 5 star! A hidden gem! Simon was my sushi chef and he was helpful with helping me order and was an exquisite chef! Thank you to him and all of the momo sushi staff!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Came here for a late lunch with my son, his girlfriend and my big brother. My son has been here before but a first for me. It's not my usual sushi place an it's a little far from where I live. But hey my son lives this place so what the heck. WOW I have to say I couldn't get enough. The rolls were amazing. I ate way to much but loved every bite. Everything was very fresh an spot on. Everything we had from the spicy edamame to the rolls an even the teriyaki chicken were sooo yummy. The prices were reasonable an the service was perfect. We sat at the sushi bar which I like as you just order what you want. I know Its a drive but I will definitely go back. I'm so glad my son suggested to go there."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi joint ever since they opened almost 3 years ago I think!  When I lived over there, I ate at Momo's at least once a week!  And for the regulars, we get VIP cards that take a percentage of each bill and give cash back off a future bill of your choice.  Johnny always gets the freshest fish in and the sushi chefs are always talking and joking with the customers.  Highly recommend it to all of my friends!"}
{"text":"Amazing every single time. Last few times I've got the Irish Roll and found it was the most amazing sushi I've ever had. Chefs are personable and friendly. Best of Las Vegas nominees for sure in the sushi category. I'll be back, of course"}
{"text":"Besides having great sushi (my favorite in Henderson,) what makes this place so enjoyable is the sushi chefs! I've been coming here for years, and it comes down to great food and awesome people. You can go anywhere and find good sushi, but it's something special when you can interact and have fun with the people working there. 

The pricing is fair, as I rarely spend more on sushi than I would at an AYCE joint. I love sitting at the sushi bar there and they always have some sort of weekend special. Live shrimp is always a favorite. 

Overall, it's just an awesome place to go and have a good time with good sushi. Nothing beats Momo's for sushi on a Friday night."}
{"text":"In Boulder City for the holidays and was looking for something other than chicken wings, burgers and fries (which I do enjoy) after 4 straight days of over indulgence. I was very hesitant to try a Sushi restaurant in a town where the culinary diversify historically (last 20+ yrs.) consisted of one Chinese food buffet (now closed) and two marginal Mexican restaurants. The hesitation quickly dissolved as I walked in and was greeted by the friendly young hostess/server and the sight of beautiful slabs of fish being sculpted by the obviously very experienced sushi chef behind the bar. The fish was fresh and the rolls were big, innovative and delicious. This place could hold its own anywhere and was a gift to find at perfect time while on vacation in BC!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, the sushi was fresh and they have a great variety. Buy one get one free sake everyday (score) and they were so kind to our kids. They just loved how they create fun little scenes and animals out of veggies and plate them the sushi. So cute!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went there as a farewell to Las Vegas,and had a few rolls as well as a cucumber salad. It was all very good. The place is a bit small so it can get loud and not much atmosphere although like I said the food was very good.  If I weren't moving out of state I would certainly go back and try some more."}
{"text":"Nice place. Like the atmosphere. Prices aren't bad and the food is real good... The sushi chef even has a sense of humor."}
{"text":"So yummy! Nice and quiet restaurant. The picture I have is of the Jesty roll, which is my favorite! The lemon slices add such a nice flavor to the soy paper salmon roll. The fish is always nice and fresh. They are very quick too. The waitresses can be a little too attentive, but I obviously can look past that. Definitely give this place a try"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Momo Sushi twice now, both for lunch. It would have been three times but the last time I tried to go for dinner it was packed. Momo definitely does the trick when I am in the mood for a little bit of sushi. Unfortunately, that is rarely the case, because when it comes to delicious raw fish, I like to stuff my face like a fatty. This is why I tend to go for sushi places that offer all you can eat... 

On my first visit I wasn't super hungry and had plans for dinner later that evening, so I just stopped in for a snack. The sushi chefs were nice and the tuna nigiri had great texture and flavor. I did find service to be a little lacking, I had to ask the sushi chef to get a waitress to refill my water, and had a bit of a wait to get the check. 

On my second visit I was very hungry. I ended up ordering edemame, a roll, as well as tuna and scallop nigiri. The sushi chef convinced me to go with the live scallop which was delicious.. but I wish I had known in advance it was going to cost me three times the price of the regular scallops. 

Pros:
Large and interesting rolls to choose from
Friendly sushi chefs
Above average fish quality

Cons:
Can get pricey quick with no option for ACYE
Waitress service is slow and not attentive enough
On the small side

Since I live fairly close and am often in the area to run errands, there is a decent change I will go back to Momo Sushi at some point. Chances are I will drive a little farther and go someplace that offers more fishy bang for my buck though!"}
{"text":"Sushi is ok and service is even worse. We came in on a Friday and it was super busy, I guess they can't handle busyness well. We waited 20 min just for the server to get our drink order and another 20 for her to come back and get our food order. They kept messing up our order and we couldn't wait to get out of there honestly. Only reason they have 2 stars is because some of their items on the menu are good but it's such a hit or miss. They need to learn how to cut fish pieces correctly. I got a roll with tuna on top and it was literally a fat CHUNK of tuna which was due to cutting too much not appetizing at all. They also did the same to my albacore sushi which is why I just ordered fried sushi or other appetizers."}
{"text":"Wasn't all you can eat but was the best sushi I've had. The service slack a little when we first sat down then got better. Might be our new to go place!! The quality of the food is so great compared to many places and so fresh! Even our daughter loved it!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Momo's for years & never have had an issue. I ordered take out and ordered a screaming orgasm and when I got home, I mixed everything together and went to take a bite of the ahi tuna and found a bug in my food. I was horrified and called Momo's to tell them what had happened. They recommended that I come back to the restaurant to show them the video and to get a refund. I went back a couple hours later and the sushi chef and waitress apologized and told me it had nothing to do with the fish as it would have been more of a parasitic worm, as this was more of a plant bug. They informed me it was from the sprouts on top of the screaming orgasm that they had received from a vendor and that in the future they will be more cautious as to cleaning the sprouts more thoroughly and they had already contacted the vendor. 
They gave me a full refund and a gift card for the future. I have never had any problems with them previously and was very caught off guard when it happened."}
{"text":"I love their spicy crab and spicy tuna! It's always fresh and delicious! They are fast and really nice."}
{"text":"No all you can eat?? Way to compete with other places guys. At least we know where we shouldn't go"}
{"text":"We are from out of town but the service and food was exceptional. We ordered a few of their rolls and some mussels and definitely some of the best rolls I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh but still not as good as Sushi Koma on corner of Flamingo and Durango."}
{"text":"This place has some of the most creative and tasty sushi rolls ever. Their staff is very welcoming and persistent. One of the best places for quick and delicious food. The not only have sushi available but a multitude of other yummy options!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi place in Henderson. They have so many variety of choices. The price is isn't as expensive even though they have such a great quality dishes. Also, great service! Five stars!"}
{"text":"I think we tried some of the more non traditional rolls, which is why I am only giving 3 stars. The rolls are good and its closer to our house but its not the best sushi I've ever had. We tried the irish roll, palm tree roll, and volcano roll. The Irish roll is somewhat odd tasting because of the liquidy sauce on it. Just an odd taste so neither of us liked it. My wife liked the palm tree roll and I really liked the volcano roll. I would recommend it to friends and will go back and try a few more rolls because overall it was good, and theres a huge selection of rolls."}
{"text":"This was a good recommendation from a friend and Yelper - glad we stopped in. The food was delicious and fresh - the price is reasonable for sushi and the service was friendly and fast. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Understaffed or they just don't care. Was seated and didn't get any serviced or over 5 minutes. I just got up and left, who knows if they even noticed. Won't go back here again. Sad."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a lunch with the family. The boxes were delicious-- I ordered it with chicken teriyaki and beef teriyaki. The beef was ok but I enjoyed the salad and rice and soup. The California roll is pretty good too :) I would recommend this for any who enjoy Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place ever . I've tried so many sushi places none of them is better than Momo . Always fresh , great quality...and i would say the most things which i am really satisfied with is always fresh food and the rice and how they wrap the sushi roll  cause most of the other places you go the, rice is not good and when you try to eat that it falls apart easily, and you cannot enjoy it. Love Momo"}
{"text":"My friend and I are always on a search for good sushi bars in Vegas and this is my personal favorite. And they have the best Screaming O' (orgasm) in town. Their food is always quality and their costumer service is pretty good. Fair warning, the low/no sodium and their regular soy sauce are the same."}
{"text":"Amazing spot in Boulder City with outdoor seating and a cozy intimate atmosphere inside. Delish Halibut with uni, screaming orgasm and nigiri combo special! Get an excellent bottle of Kurosawa sake for only $40! Steal! Lovely Erica took care of us. New favorite Local spot when visiting BC from Vegas for the day!"}
{"text":"Walked in here on my lunch because I've seen some of co-workers go here. This place is not an AYCE restaurant just FYI. Food was great I order there salmon and tuna bento. Service was nice and welcoming. Definitely will be going here again."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here. Today Megan was my server. Very sweet and prompt.  The food was excellent, fresh, well plated, fast service.  They understand food allergies and will work with you. The place is very clean. The prices are just a tad higher then the average.  Small places seats maybe 60. All in all a very nice small place to get a good quality meal."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years. Food, service and experience only get better with time. They keep serving sushi true to Japanese culture by not offering AYCE, so it's not the place for you if that's what you're looking for. If you sit at the bar be sure to ask for James!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here, the eel and avocado roll was delicious !  Very friendly staff and nice and quiet ambience. Very nice to unwind and relax. Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"The freshest sushi I have ever had. I come here often love the cherry blossom roll and I've tried about every roll here."}
{"text":"My husband and I agreed that this was the best sushi of our lives. And he would follow that up with also saying \"and I've had a shit load of sushi\"

Seriously - don't go to one of the many overpriced places in Vegas or one with all the deep fried cream cheese roll crap. Drive to Boulder City and eat here. Worth the price of a rental car"}
{"text":"I love MoMo's and would give it 5 stars. 
The only thing that really bothers me is  the music is on w=a=y too loud!!
I'm not one to sit at a restaurant and have to scream to my friends for conversation. 
It's not very enjoyable. I mean who wants to have a meal and try to relax and enjoy
with loud blaring music going on. It would be nice if the music was at a nice quaint level and not blaring like your at a
Nite club!!"}
{"text":"The new spot! Excellent sushi. Eric took care of our sushi entrees and they were delicious. One thing I really loved was how tight the rolls were. Usually I'll have a bunch of rice and ingredients piling up in my sauce bowl, and have to dump it out, but after all the rolls, all that was left was soy sauce with maybe 1-2 pieces of rice.  He even made us a personal chefs creation, which was different than the usual that we eat anywhere else but it was delicious! Great Sushi Chef!! (Pic added!) We also had dessert. At other sushi places, you might get one little scoop of ice-cream, but not at Momo Sushi, there was at LEAST 3 scoops in that bowl lol and I love ice cream, there's always room for dessert! Overall, we had a great experience and will definitely be going back, thankfully we live just around the corner! I definitely recommended it to anyone that wants to find a new place to go that is better than your usual! Thanks again Eric and Momo Sushi!"}
{"text":"I always wondered about this sushi spot when I was eating at Babystacks or Genghis so yesterday I finally ventured in. The verdict? It's okay, not outstanding, but not bad either.

For Saturday at lunch we found the restaurant to be pretty empty and we were quickly seated at a booth. I started with Edamame that wasn't good, possibly even bad. It didn't seem fresh. My other starter was a Green Salad and I absolutely loved the ginger dressing on top. My husband and I shared three rolls. We ordered the Mexico City, Hawaiian, and Shrimp Tempura. My favorite was the Hawaiian, but overall we liked all three. 

The service was mediocre. The waitress was sweet, but she seemed very frazzled even though the restaurant wasn't busy. We had to order my husband's Sprite twice and it seemed like she thought it was a new order instead of something she forgot about. After all the food arrived sans salad I had to ask for my salad a second time. She was about to take our order and ran away mid-sentence before returning to take our order. Other tables were walking back to the kitchen to ask for forgotten items too. I kind of felt bad for her because she seemed totally out of it. Maybe it was just an off day. 

Overall, the rolls were decent, but the service left a little to be desired."}
{"text":"The food is good, the service was passable. The first time we went, I asked for a substitution for one of the items in a dinner bento box (sesame chicken instead of teriyaki chicken). The second time I went, I asked for the same substitution, and was denied the request. Not sure why, they did not give a coherent explanation.

Prices are pretty standard compared to other Japanese establishments. It never seems to be too busy and they stay open fairly late compared to other places in Henderson."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in the mood for Sushi in Boulder City or Henderson, I always go to Momo Sushi! Great people and great food!"}
{"text":"The sushi is the best I had in Vegas. It's delicious and always fresh! Also try the spicy edamame. It's amazing! The service is great too - always very friendly."}
{"text":"Just tried this place today, and it's my first time trying the sushi in Las Vegas. Thus far it is the worst sushi I ate in the U.S. And considering the reviews on this place, I'm hesitant to try sushi anywhere else in Vegas if this place is considered good.
The fish is not cut right or to the correct size, it's definitely not fresh, and all together it tastes poor. 
Today's was my first and last time at this place."}
{"text":"I love this place! good customer service and good food. It's my go to sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Finally found an authentic sushi place in Henderson area. Must try the Salmon Skin Hand Roll. Very crispy and generous serving of vegetables! Also if you like squid sushi, Creative Chef designed it an actual squid AND it has mint leaf the way it should! Everything was delicious - for Sushi lovers! Thank you Momo Sushi !!!!!"}
{"text":"I took my Mom here today for lunch and was impressed with the Ahi tuna poki, while my Mom went fir the rolls. We'll be back for dinner soon! The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"It was just decent. The sushi lunch came with 6 pieces of Nigiri, and a roll of your choice from a short list (I hit the smoked salmon roll). The nigiri was a little mangled, but the roll was good. It was good enough that I would return, but I'll look hard for a better place that's nearby"}
{"text":"Nice little place with a warm atmosphere.  Good menu with many traditional Japanese items.  Terrific friendly and fast service.  We will be back - in fact it may be one of our new favorites.  My sweetheart had the teriyaki salmon dinner - which was tender and bursting with flavor.  I had the California rolls and spicey tuna rolls with an avacado salad - the rolls are best I've had yet since moving to Las Vegas in 1990.  Parking is no problem either.  Truly a welcoming addition to the Boulder city area.  Highly recommend for a quality casual sushi dining experience that wont break the bank!"}
{"text":"Service was and always is great. Andrew was my server and he was super attentive and awesome. I live down the street and this place may be a weekly stop for me"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place later one night when the original place we wanted to go was closed. I am so glad we found it. A great meal for an even better value. O got the Momo box which I couldn't even finish because it came with so much food and my boyfriend got two huge fresh rolls and finished my box. The servers were friendly and helpful. The club music and young atmosphere was incredibly relaxing for two college kids in T-shirt's. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Delicious food and great service!!! Yay momo!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The sushi is great the staff is really fun. One of the cooks even made me a special sushi roll because I wasn't sure what to get. I highly recommend to come here."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for sushi in Las Vegas.  Everything we have ordered here is excellent and fresh!  Clean and great service.  Go there immediately!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Henry roll and a California roll. Both super fresh and tasty! Service at the sushi bar was awesome, and the ambiance was lovely."}
{"text":"This place is literally right across the street from Chinook. Took one look at the line at Globefish and drove out, turned left and was seated with a hot tea. Staff was very friendly and quick. Reading some other reviews I thought it would be pricey, but I thought the opposite. Generous size portions for sashimi, 15 pcs for $17.95. I would say that's cheaper than the handful I usually dine at. I was thoroughly impressed with the tempura and agedashi tofu as well. The batter is done light and there's a good variety of vegetables and 4 shrimp. I was getting really tired of eating batter that tastes like old gross oil from some other places.

Someone also mentioned that they have just the average Japanese menu.
Which is true, because they are a Japanese restaurant. Not a Japanese fusion - put random ingredients in a roll- restaurant. They do have some popular rolls like the BC roll, Alaska roll etc.

Momo sushi keeps the heart of Japanese fare genuine- simple and very well done.

Plus points for the ginormous tea pot they keep refilling, even without asking.
Plus even more points because I will admit I have eaten here before when they first opened. It wasn't even 4 stars. But it looks like they have made leaps and bounds and improved based on critique and feedback from customers.
That earns my respect and patronage.

Review #10 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"Probably the worst service we've ever experienced. 

We were a party of 4 (myself, my wife, our 3 year-old and 6 month old). We ordered water and they only brought 2 of the three we asked for (nothing resembling a kid's cup) we eventually got another water when we ordered our food but it set the tone for the rest of the evening. 

Food arrived relatively quickly and was average sushi, nothing remarkable. We ordered udon with chicken and the waitress though the best place to put it was directly in front of our 6 month-old. Before we could even react he grabbed the plate the bowl was on and pulled it, causing extremely hot udon to splash out onto his hand. Just about every other customer saw or heard what happened and audibly reacted, some even asked what they could do, not one single employee even bothered to see if there was anything they could do. As parents we understand and accept it is ultimately our responsibility to keep our kids from harm but who in their right mind would put steaming hot soup in front of a 6 month old...?

Our last roll was brought out about 5 minutes later and that was the last time we saw our waitress until we stopped her and asked for a container for the remaining udon. That was also the only time our water was refilled, after our food was gone and we were waiting for them to bring our bill. 

When we arrived it was not very busy, by the time we received our food the dinning area had filled up  but there was never more than 1 group waiting to be seated. Had they been swamped with customers I would better understand the lack of service but there was no obvious explanation. 

Needless to say we won't be returning; average food at best and even if the food had been exceptional the quality of service would keep us away."}
{"text":"Very disappointing to say the least! We had a friend in town visiting and thought we would give Momo's a try. So very sorry we did! The tuna was puréed and we didn't like the taste or consistency of gobo. Would not go back."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! The staff is friendly and provide excellent service. It's a very clean and fun environment. Highly recommend this place for sushi and Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"St. Patty's dinner with my honey and I was inspired to order the \"Screaming Honey\" lol. Glad I did bc it's freakin' amazing!!!! The price for one order of it is about $8 (rounded off) but I ended up ordering two just for myself. Yes, it was that good!!! And on top of the great food, the service was beyond my expectations. I've lost interest in dining in here after I noticed that one of my favorite servers was no longer at this restaurant, but I'm happy to say that our server tonight, Nickie, has changed that."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy his place regularly. We are super excited they are coming to Boulder City!"}
{"text":"Is it amazing? No. So far, we haven't found an amazing, 5 star worthy, sushi restaurant in Vegas/Henderson. :(. BUT its second to I Love Sushi, and a close second at that.  The location is great, and it is our go-to spot when we're craving sushi. It is a solid place to get your Japanese food fix. It won't wow you, but it won't disappoint either. I recommend the crispy spicy tuna--- it's REALLY really good. You can find it on the \"special\" menu. :)"}
{"text":"Not too bad, it's no Kaizen, but it's ok. 
Location is good for me. But the restaurant is a little outdated but the service is very mediocre"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my boyfriend and it's been great each time. The ugly roll is my favorite, along with one of the fruity sakes. The service in the dinning room is ok, but its nicer to sit at the sushi bar to watch the Chef prepare the rolls or ask for something they might not have on the menu ."}
{"text":"You can't compare this restaurant to an all you can eat sushi spot.. 
The Chefs are super nice! The food is delicious!!! And the service is great! 
We love the 2 for 1 sake most of all though!"}
{"text":"There just aren't enough good things to say about this place!  The service is AMAZING.  Everybody is so friendly, and Chef B especially makes visiting Momo a welcome and entertaining experience each and every time.  

The food has never disappointed.  We've probably tried everything on the menu at least once, but our absolute favorite top two things to order are the Henry Roll and the Ugly Roll.  Sometimes, when we don't know what we want, B takes over and just creates something for us on the fly.. he's truly a very talented and detail oriented chef!!!

Sometimes we'll visit other sushi places, but we always regret we didn't just go to Momo Sushi instead.  It's as good as it gets in our book!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and we really enjoyed it. This place does not have all you can eat so if that's what you're looking for don't bother. Their sushi selection is really good and so was the service. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I wanted to find something close to home and last time I had momo I enjoyed it so I decided to come back tonight. The boyfriend and I ordered 10 pieces of gyoza [he's in love with gyoza, if the restaurant has it on the menu, he's automatically ordering it]. Gyoza was alright, I would give it a 4/5. We also ordered kalbi which came with rice and miso soup and priced at $15. Kind of pricey but it was cooked quite well. Very flavorful and came on a sizzling plate like at typical Korean restaurants. For sushi we ordered salmon, kanpachi, uni, and the hooter's roll. The fresh wasabi they put on the fish has a kick to it so be careful with that. Salmon was good, but you can't usually go wrong with salmon unless it's too fishy smelling. I was a bit disappointed in their kanpachi. I usually love kanpachi but it was sliced quite thin so I could barely taste it. The uni here is always good!! I'd definitely recommend it. And the hooter's roll was like the cucumber protein roll but with radish instead of cucumber wrapped around it. It was refreshing but I think I prefer cucumber instead of radish. Overall, I'd go again and I'd recommend this place for sushi if you wanted something around this area."}
{"text":"We went into Momo about 8:30pm on New Years Eve and it was very quiet. Sat at the sushi bar and the chefs were ready to help. They have a big sushi menu and dinner menu. First off, don't worry about them NOT having AYCE because the rolls you get are huge.  The fish was very fresh and tasty. The service is very attentive and everyone is very friendly. This is one of the better sushi places in Vegas. Glad we stopped in in a whim."}
{"text":"You get a lot of food for the price. We especially enjoyed the lunch special where you get to pick two entrees to go with soup, salad, and gyoza and rice. 
  I liked the salmon teriyaki, and the chicken katsu was pretty crispy. Ginger salad was good too.
   My six year old said that the food was really yummy. The children's box is the same price as the lunch special. I would pick the lunch special since you get more selection.
   My only complaint was that the hot water in the woman's bathroom is scalding.  My 6 year old burned 2 of her fingers washing her hands. So  if you are bringing children to the bathroom, you need to regulate the water. We did tell the waitress and hopefully they will turn the water down.
 Overall, we will eat here again. I agree with Sunny D's review- sushi is right up there and the prices are reasonable only at lunch time.

We ordered take out for dinner, and the dinner menu prices were overpriced. I would eat here only for lunch. When we ordered take out, they forgot one menu item and we had to drive back and get the rest of the order."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner with my friend. I ordered the sushi dinner for $20. The sushi was very fresh. I had the Alaskan sushi specialty roll and my friend had the tomato roll which tasted very good and was low carb with rice. Definitely a healthy option. Great ambiance and close to the house. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has an excellent selection. Their rolls are all reasonably priced. This was a perfect lunch meal. 3 rolls and a seaweed salad for under $30. They do not do All you can eat here but I think thats a good thing. Their quality is much higher as a result. The place itself is sort of hidden off the west side of Stephanie in a small strip mall. Definitely check this place out if you are a Sushi coniseur."}
{"text":"I don't know where people are getting bad service, but it's not here. There was a large party, several families, and a bar full of people - and we still got super service. We ordered several rolls to share, and they came out as made, one at a time - and quick! Loved the Irish roll (but then, I would, huh?) The Orion roll was delightfully spicy and flavorful. The Rock-n-Roll did, in fact, rock. Hot tea got immediate refills without asking. Prices were mid-range. Sake prices were too high to bother with, though.

Clean, small, close to home, and yummy (and since Yummy shut down, we've been looking for another...)

My only complaint is that the music seriously bites. Bad rap-fusion-80's asian-not-sure-what-but-it's-bad. Just bad.

Music bad. Food good."}
{"text":"Sitting here at the bar as I write my review, I am glad they haven't changed anything about this place. It is NOT all you can eat but their rolls are BIG so if you are a NORMAL person, with a NORMAL stomach you will be good with 2 rolls which amounts to all you can eat anyway. Usually all the \"all you can eat\" places have tiny rolls. The employees are very nice, and on top of everything. I finished my cucumber salad and the sushi chef asked me if I wanted more. I took a long time looking at the menu and was asked like 2 times if I was ready to order. I will definitely be back again and again. This time I ordered the Triple A roll and a standard California roll. Delicious! I have also had their Volcano roll in the past and the Jennifer 2. I recommend all!"}
{"text":"Yet again another amazing experience for dinner with the family! Food is always delicious, service is pretty quick. Always accommodating! Love this place!"}
{"text":"When I was in San Francisco 2 weeks ago, I drove all the way to try the best chinese chicken wings at San Tung.  I wasn't too impressed because I ordered the dry ones and got the wet wings.... However, out of this Barry F messaged me to try it again and stated that when he comes to Henderson, he loves MOMO Sushi so he was surprised I did not review it...

I took the opportunity to check this out over the weekend and I loved it.  Thanks Barry.

The environment - Cozy, soft lighting, nice sushi bar, the place is just right to me. It seems that it was perfectly suited to be a sushi restaurant. It just works right!

The service - A bit homey and homestyle, so you get both caring people who can be a bit slow at times.  Hey, you know what, that is okay with me because it feels like family.

The Sushi - This is where the place excels.  Had several orders of  Uni, Amai Ebi, Maguro, Tai, Hamachi, It was all so very good.  Large nice pieces of fish and very flavorful. You should be aware that they do use the wasabi on the sushi between the rice and the fish, so if you don't want it, you should tell them.  I enjoy it but my son prefers to not have wasabi.  I was not happy that they did not have the Toro that was on the menu and the Kai as they were out.  I also ordered Mirugai and they were out of this too.  Boo hoo.  I would have marked them a 4 star for the food but what they did have was awesome.  I have to give kudos to the Amai Ebi.  The fried shrimp head was so plump and so delicious.  I wonder if they somehow stuffed the them heads with something way deliciouso???  We also had some seriously large rolls like Tiger, Dragon, and a few others.  All were good and tasty, just that I am not a huge Roll person.

The price - For about 4-5 rolls and all the nigiri sushi, we spent about 100.00 so while for the three of us it was more expensive than an AYCE place, the quality was amazing.

GK says, check it out..."}
{"text":"This is my go to take-out sushi place when I want to eat at home. Their sushi is always fresh and prepared pretty quickly. On a busy Friday night it takes about 15-20 minutes for the order. My favorite roll there is their Irish roll. It has a ton of flavor. Every other roll I've tried has been delicious as well."}
{"text":"One of the best Japanese meals I've had in town, and my husband was pleased at how quickly we got served. I had the Momo box-- excellent tempura! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Lunch specials and dinner boxes are great deals!  Its not an AYCE sushi place but they have great tasting nigiri and sushi.  I ordered and the Sushi Dinner Box and ordered the Stuffed Tomato Roll (great for you salmon lovers out there.  Salmon sashimi wrapped around spicy crab, greens, and topped ponzu sauce).  6 chef picked pieces of nigiri and miso soup were also included.  Food prep was quick and staff was nice."}
{"text":"Found hair in my food and they didn't apologize or discount the meal... they just looked at me & said thats not hair... but then after examining it closer they said yeah its hair then took the plate. Unsanitary! No customer service!"}
{"text":"Welcoming staff in an inviting location.  Cold house Saki was good. Loads of \"Specialty Rolls\" selections BUT no Nigri... not acceptable!  Flavors were very good with proper spice of the rolls we chose ... prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"The momos on Stephanie is my friends and I'd go-to for sushi. The sushi is amazing every time and I've been there many many times. James is our guy!! He always does an amazing and quick job behind the counter. He also turns fruits into animals or characters haha!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I had a great experience!  My friend and I came and ordered the nigiri special with one roll, and another roll a la carte. The rolls were good. Standard good rolls from a sushi restaurant but nothing spectacular.  

What blew my socks off was the nigiri!  It was so fresh and delicious!  In vegas you have a lot of all you can eat sushi so the nigiri you get there is kind of ehhhh.... Either too much rice, or the fish is not fresh.... Or something about it is just off.  But this is not an all you can eat sushi place. The quality was very good. The coloring, the butteriness of the fish, the soft texture, everything was on point. Nigiri special changes daily as its up to the chefs choice. 

I don't eat in Henderson often by im glad I came here.  They also have great beer on draft and happy hour as well!"}
{"text":"Used to go there every other week. Last time, was last.  Awful waitress, she didn't understand anything, got our order totally wrong. It was Saturday night, we sat at the sushi bar, but no fresh live seafood. We order from the kitchen, same, could get anything we were ordering.  Too bad, I used to love that place."}
{"text":"I am not hard to please and try to give benefit of the doubt more than I should but I have been disappointed on the service here on more than one occasion recently. I've been coming here for many years and the food has always been great but service is hit & miss.  Today I called in a order for 2 simple items, a Screaming O with extra sauce and a Jackpot Roll.  When I arrive, there were only 2 people dining so it wasn't busy, I pay for food and check my bag for the extra sauce I asked for.  My ticket had it on there but there was just the standard cup that always comes with the Screaming O.  I tell the waitress that I am missing it and she proceeds to tell me that the cup in there is extra.  Mind you I have been ordering this from there to go for over 10 years. Then the other waitress ask is everything ok and I show and tell her that it wasn't extra sauce and she says \"sorry\", I just stand there in shock that she is not getting my extra sauce but just looking at me. I then tell her that the service is not good and it clearly says extra sauce.  She them says you will have to pay extra for it.  I am baffled!!!! The ticket says extra sauce, you should have already charged me if there was a charge, how does it say it and you don't give it and yet have the nerve to tell me to pay more.  I just grabbed by bag and walked out.  I am sure the management will not respond or attempt to satisfy my lack of decent service. They will be loosing a longtime customer that spends and tips generously there.  Mind you I tipped the waitresses despite my frustration with them.  Step up your game Momo Sushi. There are many other choices around!!!"}
{"text":"To end a day full of shopping with my friend, we decided to get one of my favorite meals: sushi! I'm always open to trying new sushi joints, especially if it's super close to my house! The shopping really built up an appetite for me so I was definitely looking forward to this visit. 

This restaurant in the same building as Genghis Grill and the new Baby Stacks restaurants. When you walk into the location, you will notice a couple of things: it's dark and crowded! The waiting area was very small, but once you pass that, you see the sushi bar to the left, for sure a focal point as it's practically the only lit area in the restaurant. To the right was the dining area. Here's what I can say: it's crowded with tables and unnecessary decor. antlers on the walls, fake plants and vines are really outdated and don't really fit the restaurant's personality. The booths had low hanging dim lights and ours was covered in dust. Definitely needs a spring cleaning in there! Our server's name was Megun and she was definitely one with a lot of personality! I was wearing a sriracha shirt, which she noticed and started a conversation from. I really appreciated her attentiveness throughout our meal. 

For our late lunch, I wanted to get a hamachi kama. The problem was they ran out of it, so I had to choose something else. Darn! I ended up getting 4 orders of the Hamachi Nigiri for $4.50 an order (2 pieces per order) and 2 orders of the tako for $4.25 per order. One thing that threw me off about this place was the fact that they didn't offer the All You Can Eat option. That meant my meal was going to be pricey for not a lot of stuff. For the food, I thought it was just alright. The hamachi was pink in color, pinker than I'm used to. Made me think if that was super fresh or just a different part of the fish. It was good though. What I did not like, however, was the fact that they put wasabi between the rice and fish. That was new and a complete surprise as it stung my nose! LOL. Be advised, you do not need wasabi in your soy sauce.  There's already wasabi in the sushi, and lots of it! The tako (octopus) was the same with the wasabi. I thought the flavor and texture was consistent with what I often times get, so no surprises there, it was very good. 

For me, this was hard. When I go to restaurants looking for sushi, I'm looking to get a lot of it. To pay the same amount as I would for an All You Can Eat meal at another restaurant, I really didn't get a lot of food. I wouldn't mind coming back and trying something else, but if it's sushi, I would probably opt to go to a sushi joint with an AYCE option. Thanks Momo, though, for the experience. I appreciate it!"}
{"text":"Was looking for good sushi so Google Searched some places and this is where intended up.  Great friendly quick service and selection. The sushi was really good and prices were fair!  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Once again Momo delivers! Momo Sushi has become our must go to place when we're visiting from California. The ambiance and the food are unmarked we are yet to find a place in California that matches this package. I would and have highly recommended this place to friends and acquaintances."}
{"text":"Even tho we don't get to go here as often as I'd like, I still consider Momo Sushi one of the better sushi restaurants in Henderson. The quality of of the food plus the attentive & friendly service makes for a great dining experience every time we go. 
During our most recent visit back at the end of February, they finally had the live shrimp that we had wanted to try on our 1st visit so we got an order of that. Although I didn't know exactly what was involved in the preparation of the shrimp, the end product was delicious!"}
{"text":"We love this place.   We've taken a few people here and it is unanimous that the sushi is freshest and best anyone has ever had.  Sit at the sushi bar,  be honest with the sushi chefs, and trust them in making something a little bit more unique for you (if you're not on a super tight budget).  If you're a little bit more careful, the sushi rolls are very filling and very delicious....but the sushi bar experience really is amazing."}
{"text":"I go to Momo Sushi about once a month, and I have never left disappointed. 

On my most recent visit, for my wedding anniversary, my wife and I shared a couple of rolls, and the Momo Box, which includes teriyaki chicken, rice, 4 sushi rolls, and a few other samples. We spent under $40 on this visit. Not $40 each, but $40 total. I find the prices here to be more than reasonable, especially considering how good the food is. 

I've brought several friends here, some of whom could be called sushi snobs, and I've heard nothing but praise for the quality and taste of food served here. The location on Stephanie puts Momo Sushi a quick drive from most of Henderson, and a great alternative to eating at the mall when spending an afternoon there. The ambiance is inviting, and the servers are always friendly.

Be sure to check in on Yelp to get a free dessert!"}
{"text":"Kat and I often get sushi cravings that lead us into trouble; case in point, last weekend we had a date and when deliberating about what to eat, we only needed to give each other a sly look and nod. SUSHI! So we decided to try out this place across Chinook Center; we haven't been before, and Angelo T. recommended it as decent.

We were struck by the charming intimacy, and as soon as we started rattling off our demands, we realized we might need a bigger table. We got takoyaki and gyoza to start, and both were as good as we've ever had. We then ordered the smoked salmon and dynamite rolls, along with the standard California rolls, and to top it off, Kat got a teriyaki beef rice bowl, and I got a dinner box with 5 pieces of sashimi, teriyaki pork and tuna rolls. Immediate regrets! Our table happily groaned with the weight, and we ate as diligently as we could; needless to say, Kat's bowl was untouched and came home with us.

The food was delicious; I don't normally get sashimi, but the pieces were fresh and texturally sound. The teriyaki had an interesting sweet undertone, almost as if cinnamon was present. I think perhaps a smaller order would have worked better to give all the items their chance to shine. The service was good and enthusiastic, and I would recommend Momo as a good place to satisfy a sushi craving."}
{"text":"High quality, very well prepared and above average quantity.   Price is right.  I think this worthy.  One skinny waitress was awesome.  Very friendly.
I am making this a regular place for me."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while out shopping and decided to give it a shot.

The interior was very nice, dim with comfortable booths and tables. The booth seats were a little worn but that's OK.

They had quite a good variety of rolls and very reasonably priced. Everything was fresh, tasty and the service was super friendly. We had two specialty rolls, a basic roll and two beers for just $40. We also had a free dessert with the Yelp check in. The green tea ice cream was a perfect finish. 

This may be my new go-to local place."}
{"text":"I just love everything here! Their yum yum scallop hand roll is my favorite here compared to any other place in town..they know how to get down on rolls and just everything tastes good.."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times now and decided to write a review for the awesome service and response from Andrew and Megan. The chirashi bowl was very good quality, and it is just amazing find here in Henderson !"}
{"text":"First time here. Great food! Awesome service too! 
Thank you Meghan for being so nice and always checking on our table."}
{"text":"I never realy cared for sushi until I visited this place. My favorite is the Ugly Roll with yum yum sauce. The employees are great too."}
{"text":"First must say the sushi is AMAZING ...
Secondly the Staff is friendly and very attentive ! I recommend this place to anyone who knows what fresh fish is ! I love the tuna karai!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi and fried dumplings were both so good!! Highly recommend the SS Roll! Our waitress was very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious. The Jennifer 2 was extremely good. I ordered 2 rolls. The only downfall was the service. The waitress forgot to put our order in so we waited a very long time for our rolls, but she apologized and gave us some edamame on the house. We sat at a table, but we'll most likely sit at the bar the next time we visit."}
{"text":"One of my go to lunch places. Good customer service. Great selection and portion size of the bentos. Nigiris have good rice to seafood ratio.."}
{"text":"Momo Sushi is my go-to spot for dinner when I'm in Boulder. In a small town like Boulder City, vegan options are a rare commodity indeed. However, vegans can usually DIY something at Japanese restaurants (think edamame, veggie tempura, tofu, etc.). Momo Sushi is nice enough that they accommodate my off the menu requests. I order tofu with steamed veggies topped with teriyaki sauce. If I'm extra hungry. I'll order a side of rice ($2). My DIY meal is actually under $10, so it's super affordable. There's also a veggie roll on the menu that I'm definitely ordering on my next visit. 

I've been to Momo's with my husband and friends, and everyone wholeheartedly gives their approval. It's a cozy little restaurant with super reasonable prices. In fact, on our last visit, our dinner came to $18.95! Gotta love that price tag.

{"text":"Momo Sushi is your standard neighborhood restaurant, suitable for a quick eat after shopping. We had miso soup, tuna nigiri, some special spicy roll, and ice cream. 

Some noticeable traits: the lighting does not work well with the menus, as the glare makes the reading uncomfortable, and my ice cream was partially melted. Another interesting characteristic is that the fish on the nigiri seems lengthy compared to the rice. It's not hugging the mound of rice, like most, but instead trails off both ends. It doesn't mean anything, I suppose, it just looks different."}
{"text":"It's not all you can eat but not better ten a lot of the all you can eat place I've been to. Get more bang for your buck and go to another all you can eat."}
{"text":"momo's is small and cozy... it's a family owned place and so gracious!  i love sushi chef james... he makes me specialities not on the menu.  : )  affordable, fresh seafood and nice ppl.  cant go wrong.


no all you can eat sushi here. but they do have 2 for 1 house sake."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant is one of the best you'll find in Henderson! Top notch rolls, excellent presentation and their lunch and dinner specials are unbelievable! I've been coming here for as long as I can remember and will never stop!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Since the previous owners. The service is sometimes a little lacking, but the sushi is absolutely incredible EVERY SINGLE TIME. So the good makes us for when the service isn't that great. My favorite place. I always end up coming back here! And two for the price of one sake everyday?? Yes please!"}
{"text":"Me and my family are big sushi eaters and this was the first time we ate at a Las Vegas sushi spot. We're from the bay area, California where there are some great sushi place and I must say, we did not like the sushi from here at all. We thought it was over priced for something so simple and it didn't even wow us. It was mediocre but we ate it because we were hungry. I recommend not to go here...please find some other sushi place. This place is not worth it. I hope not all sushi spots in LV are like this one."}
{"text":"The staff was talking to each other rather than serving the tables. Our order came wrong and one of the dishes came undercooked - cold in the middle"}
{"text":"They place was ok a bit small and crowded but the food was good and great flavor, it was my first time here, staff is ok hard to understand their English."}
{"text":"I have been going to Momo Sushi for 11 years, ever since they first opened. I have tried everything on the menu! I love the rolls, and all the different sauces they make. I enjoy going to Momo and always have a great time, talking to John the owner, and if you sit at the Sushi bar, you can have a lot of fun with the chefs, buy them a sake or a beer if you can, they really appreciate it! Make sure you check out Momo, it is a locals favorite!"}
{"text":"My favorite local sushi place!!! Go there ALL the time. Love the rolls and the sashimi is great too. Irish Roll is our number one. Reasonable prices and never too overcrowded."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here all the time. The sushi is excellent, the service is prompt, and the sushi chefs are friendly. It is not overpriced, and it is very laid back. I always get sushi- the SS Roll is really good, and it is gluten-free (my husband is allergic to wheat.) This place is rarely crowded, and the sushi is always fresh, so it is our go-to place for a casual night out :)"}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here & we will definitely be back! Everything we tried was amazing, especially the screaming orgasm!"}
{"text":"Boulder City has only one REAL sushi restaurant and that is Momos.  You can drive to Vegas only to get the same or less quality.  It is small and sometimes everyone in Boulder City decides to come eat at once and it can get busy.  Be patient.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"We liked this place, service was good, selection was great, fish was fresh. Way better than Tokyo boys, thats for sure! I'd still rather go to a good AYCE place but this one wasn't bad and they have some unique stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood sushi. Small but good. The fish is always fresh and the service good. Love the rolls without rice. My son loves to eat veggie rolls and watch football here."}
{"text":"This place just became one of my top three sushi spots! Great presentation! Great atmosphere and the chefs at the bar are of great conversation and know how to deliver good laughs! The super white fish that I had is by far some of the best tasting kind I've enjoyed. Definitely on a must come back soon list for me."}
{"text":"this is me and my fiancé's favorite sushi restaurant. it makes me sad to see the couple of bad reviews on here. we think the service is great and the food amazing. we always get their specialty roll the momoyama but also try something new every time and its always great. We have a hard time going other sushi places because we like it so much here. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews, test it out yourself. :-)"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch yesterday, and since we had recently had sushi, we opted for the bento box. The lunch was fantastic! I had the bento with shrimp tempura and mackeral, and my son had the kalbi and chicken katsu. Everything was really good, however, the kalbi and the tempura were my favorites."}
{"text":"What can I say about MoMo.. They really do have some wonderful Sushi! A bit overpriced in some areas, and no AYCE options, but I have never had a bad roll or bad sashimi here. I used to frequent another Henderson sushi restaurant until their quality went downhill (significantly) and my husband introduced me to MoMo. The Irish roll and Something Wrong are some of my favorites, and if you like crispy (fried) sushi, Tara's Fatty is one for you (read: cream cheese and shrimp). The volcano is also very good if you want more crab and less cream cheese. 

The wait staff can be spotty at times, but never rude. I have only had one issue with a waitress who made my young son cry, but I have not seen her in there in a while. Anyway, if you go on a busy day (Fridays at dinner and Lunch on the weekdays seem to take the cake) then you might get less than stellar wait service if they are understaffed. However, the food more than makes up for the staffing issues in my opinion. I have been going to MoMo for about 2 years now, and highly recommend it over any other sushi restaurant in Henderson."}
{"text":"I'm from Cali and very picky about my sushi it was super yummy and fresh. The waiter was very patient the menu was so large we didn't know what to order. We ended up ordering several items and was more than satisfied this has to be the best sushi we had since relocating to Las Vegas . It's been a long journey looking for good eats especially if your a true foodie from Cali don't think twice you will definitely be satisfied!!!"}
{"text":"I will give 5 STARS next time, when the orange slice is not two days old. But thanks for the Gree Tea Ice cream YELP FREE DESSERT. Thank you to Andrew and the staff. They seemed tired and over work for a full house on Friday. But still gave a big smile."}
{"text":"To enjoy this place you need to follow some rules.  Rule one: sit at the sushi bar because the sushi chefs are terrific and the servers are kind of lame.  The menu and choice of rolls is huge and there are some very unique offerings (never saw banana in a roll before) so just dig in because the fish is super fresh.  Rule two: order the sake because it is buy one get one.  If you don't sit at the bar you may miss the sign that announces this amazing deal.  Rule three: make sure not to forget the second sake.  Cheap hot sake is the best!

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent. We got three rolls and each was fresh and delicious. Great, friendly service."}
{"text":"This place has great Bento boxes, but the teriyaki chicken had lots of pepper on it (not normal). And then I had to get my own to-go box for my food because we were completely ignored. We had to ask for the check, and when they delivered the check is when they finally asked why I didn't eat my chicken. They were speedy at picking up the check w a credit card, but that was it!"}
{"text":"This place never fails to impress me. The staff are so friendly and the food is incredible. No place I have been has sushi that can compare. It is the most comfortable hang out with the best food you could ask for. Love you guys!"}
{"text":"Husband and I wanted sushi take out to enjoy during Sunday night football, so this review is for only one visit of take out. The portions are good and fish is very fresh as mentioned before. I liked the roll that had salmon and lemon on top - forgot the name. The baked dynamite I would not order again. Philly roll was good, but that is a basic roll & hard to mess up. Would definitely order from here again, yet the budget won't allow for that all too often because the rolls are a bit pricey here. Standard philly roll was $7 and specialty rolls will run you $13 or more."}
{"text":"The worst - service AND food. Last night (Saturday), we went there for dinner. Sat in the very back of the restaurant and wait staff walked by us ALL the time, but yet we had to ask to get water and ask to please take our order. Once our order was taken, we waited and waited (again wait staff running by us ALL the time). All of the tables around us got their food and began their dinner. We stopped our server and she said oh! I didn't punch in your order. FINALLY we get our meal and my roll had curdled cream cheese in it. It was disgusting. The service here was poor- very poor. I will never go back."}
{"text":"High quality fish, very reasonable prices and FAST, great service! Sit at the bar, the chefs are very entertaining and full of character. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Great service! A vast variety of sushi. Too many to count. The sushi was fresh and very flavorful."}
{"text":"Really good sushi, very fresh and great deal on saki
Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"My mom and I had a great dinner here - we had the rainbow roll and the heart attack, and it was SO good. The chefs there are so great! I love crispy rice spicy tuna but they didn't have it on the menu, but they made it for me anyway and it was probably the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I started to appreciate Momo Sushi more and more, lately.

It is actually a pretty good place, a bit overpriced for the portion size, though.

Portions are very small, though well prepared. They arrive fast, and service is friendly. A bit uneven at times, but the girls excuse that with a genuinely positive attitude and a smile. But there were cases when I was hungry and had to order an appetizer after the main plate just to stop feeling hungry.

Personally I'd prefer a better balance between the quality, size and price of the plates, so Momo won't be a four star in my books - but I am totally ok to return or recommend this place to someone who just wants sushi immediately next to the Chinook mall."}
{"text":"Frequency: First Time, after lunch hours

Order: Sashimi platter (for two), Salmon and a Sweet Egg Nigiri and Sweet (live) shrimp.

Overall: Close proximity to where I live, fresh Sashimi, decent prices and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Some of the best, freshest sushi I've ever had! And in the middle of the desert.

The staff was super friendly. And the prices weren't that bad. Everything was delicious.

The hot tea was brought out in some cool cups too which I thought was cool.

I would Definitely recommend this place to anyone rolling through Boulder City to see Hoover Dam and wants to eat. 

Will be back with the rest of my family all the way from California!"}
{"text":"Nice sashimi!  Very fresh and good quality.  It would be perfect if the wasabi in nigiri were even at every piece."}
{"text":"First and the last time I eat at this place! I ordered the Udon shrimp soup, it was so bad, got the veggie noodles ,the broccoli was brown and old the cabbage was so soggy! Waste of money and time , had to throw away the food! So disappointed !!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in the area for good sushi and sake!
Check it out in the Henderson area!"}
{"text":"Top sushi place.  If they have blue fin tuna, get it!  It's pricey at $10 for two pieces of sashimi, but it's well worth it if you like tuna.  Best I ever had."}
{"text":"What can I say? Amazing, delicious and tasty sushi! Very fresh. I happened to be in Boulder City as my BF had an errand to run. We were starving and I happened to come across yelp and the restaurants in this are. We rolled the dice and are happy we did! It's a quaint little place but it was packed and I can see why. We came right before rush hour, people just kept walking in. Staff was attentive and warm. Great job Momo! If I'm back in this area I will definitely stop by :)"}
