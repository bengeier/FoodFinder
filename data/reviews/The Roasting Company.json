{"text":"I've lived in Charlotte over a decade - I can't believe it either - and lived all over the city. The one constant is that I'll schlep from anywhere in the city to Montford for the Roasting Company.

For me, it's the Tico sauce, not so much the Jaco sauce. I have to have some Tico black beans with extra Tico at least once a week. I just keep forgetting to go on Fridays when they have stewed okra and tomatoes. Darnit!

And I agree with the other poster who mentioned just how many restaurants have come and gone on Montford over the years. The Roasting Company still remains."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick and local lunch. The chicken is moist, juicy and tender. The half chicken is a fantastic deal, for the extra $2 you are rewarded with 50% more meat. The sauce counter is full of spicy surprises. Overall a great local lunch joint - the kind of place you will like introducing to your friends."}
{"text":"this place is really going down hill fast....been eating there since they opened and not only is the food now lacking but the service is just flat out bad. Called an order to go today and made 3 stops prior in about 30 minutes and still had to wait on my food. A few weeks ago they completely missed one of our dinners on a take-out order as well.  Such a shame"}
{"text":"It so disappointing when a great place goes under new management and everything people love about it changes.
When I heard Jake wasn't there anymore I couldn't believe it. Perhaps it's all coincidence or the new manager has something to do with it. But by the looks of it they have taken a hit in business, go figure since the atmosphere has completely changed. This place also seems less friendly to Montford, they now only do food until 1:30, and close at 12 Sun-Wed. They only offer  a limited menu after 10, and they no longer provide table service. Drink specials seem to have stayed the same but for all you beer lovers, the draft lineup is never switched up anymore, huge downfall.
My husband and I were maybe not frequent enough to call regulars but were in there at least 3 times per month (enough as to where Jake and Danielle knew us by name). It was a little treat to go to The Roasting Co., get a drink and dinner, get recommendations on places in Charlote with good food. Now we like to go to Moosehead down the street.
Also, they are lucky ALE hasn't hit them yet considering the new manager drinks at the bar out in the open during work (very unprofessional).
We'll be getting all togo from here on out."}
{"text":"I walked away from the Roasting Company, after my first visit, with a big smile and wallet in tacked.  I had a 1/4 roasted chicken (dark meat) with collards, white bean stew and a cornbread muffin for 6.99 with tax.

The chicken was tasty, although I could see where their white meat may sometimes be a little dry.  The highlight was the white bean stew which is their veggie of the day on Thursday's.  It may be a while before I work up another appetite but when I do you will be able to find me at the Roasting Company."}
{"text":"The best place in Charlotte for a good, cheap, filling meal (especially to-go). You can't go wrong with the quarter chicken (white meat), two vegetables and the included corn bread. We pick up dinner here about once a week and both my wife and I can get more than enough for about $11 total."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  I think we eat here about once a week.  The food is excellent and we feel like we're \"eating healthy\" (if we order the right dishes, of course) even while eating out.  I would classify it as \"southern style\" cuisine with dishes like pulled pork, chicken on the bone, and sides like collard greens (and a ton of others).  The chicken is phenomenal.  Always perfectly cooked.
The bar at this place is great!  A little on the small side with only a handful of stools but the beer selection is excellent.  This is a full bar with wine and mixed drinks as well.  The parking can be a bit of a pain but that is true for every business on Montford St.  It's actually better than most places on Montford St.
The few times I've used the salsa bar it's been a bit of a mess.  They could do better to keep that station clean and stocked.
If you are in the mood for some good chicken, pork, and a bunch of excellent side choices, try this place out.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Decent lunch place for a quick and easy meal. Chicken is good and well plated. An array of side dishes available to suit all customers. Pricing is fair and inexpensive. A no frills chicken joint that's all about the chicken!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with colleagues during the recent Teacher Workdays. I wasn't overly impressed. I ordered the chicken salad on a roll with a side of baked beans, and it was just nothing special. I usually like to go to lunch and be waited on, but we were in a hurry and a colleague suggested The Roasting Company. I have never been here, so I thought, what the heck,I'll try it. I figured it was pretty popular when we walked up to the restaurant and the line was almost out the door. The chicken salad was bland and the only thing I was really able to taste were  the walnuts added to it. The baked beans were too spicy and there was a jalapeño pepper sliced and mixed in with the beans. Overall, not impressed and wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Loved my experience here! The chicken was delicious. They catered to my indecisiveness and I was able to get half white meat/half dark. With a double order of veggies, I was able to find a paleo-friendly meal at a great price! 

I went on Thursday and they had good wine specials and an awesome trivia concept called \"Not your Boyfriends Trivia.\" All questions were geared towards females and it was so entertaining! 

Chicken. Wine. Trivia. I don't think I could ask for anything better!"}
{"text":"Squash casserole is the best! Love the chicken too! My new favorite fast food that doesn't taste fast :) try them !"}
{"text":"The food was great.  I had a 1/2 chicken with Okra and tomatoes and squash casserole.  My date had 1/4 chicken white with cornbread dressing and slaw.  If was generous portions and the tab was $20 which is incredible!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It has delicious food made from scratch and the service is fast. I especially love the pork. And they have cider on tap which I favor over beer. I also enjoy the patio on warm days."}
{"text":"When I worked in this area, I used to eat lunch here once every week. They have a good variety of roased chicken dishes and the food comes with some delicious spicy cornbread muffins. The chicken is delicious but don't sleep on the jaco pork which has a hard to describe BBQ-like sauce. I think the pork stands up to it better than chicken could. Then kick it up with some of their hot sauce. 

The sides are also quite good. I usually stick with the collards but there's plenty to choose from. I usually get my grub on for around $7. Man, talking about it makes me wish I still worked near there."}
{"text":"Okay so it was my friend's idea to go here. Honestly if I had checked it out online first I probably wouldn't have gone. In reality the food is lacking flavor. I mean, it's good but it could use some more flavors as far as seasoning the chicken. Seriously. I had the chicken salad sandwich and it was super bland in my mouth. Couldn't finish it. I also had mac and cheese which was okay but I was confused why they labeled it spicy when there was not a twinge of spicy lol. I tasted my friend's veggies, and they just weren't very flavorful. I guess if you are on a low sodium diet, or you just like plain food you should go here. I mean, I wanted to like it, but I couldn't get past the lack of seasoning. If you all are gonna do an arroz con pollo you need to add some flavor. (tasted that too). I need yall to spice up your life @theroastingcompany lol"}
{"text":"Good food but lately poor execution.  I usually order the Monterey chicken wrap.  The first time I ordered it I had to learn the hard way that by \"peppers\" on the menu description they mean jalapeño peppers (not bell peppers which I assumed).  Well the following two times Ive ordered this I ask for no jalapeño peppers.  They add it anyway.  Lastnight I bit into something hard TWICE.  Two 2\" chicken rib bones.  Come on man.  Im done with this place."}
{"text":"The roasting company is just good... no two ways about it.  It is a mix of Tex Mex, Southern, Jamaican, and everything else.  No real way to classify it.  The chicken tastes kinda like the rotisserie places in Queens, the ones where you buy the entire chicken and take it home.  

The chicken is flavorful, the cornbread dressing is a little spicy, the wraps are awesome and the prices are just right.  Great when its cold out an you want to warm up for lunch.  Definitely a hearty meal.  I never care about decor, but if you are into a comfy atmosphere, this place might not be for you.  I could care less, all about food for this big girl.  

TIp, the lines are really, really long around lunch time.  If you aren't eating in, call in your order and bypass the line by going to the call ahead counter.  The line goes into the parking lot some days and it can be hard to find a table."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place. The chicken and black bean con queso is to die for. We enjoyed it so much we went back the next day to try something different. The quality of the chicken is some of the best I've seen. Can't wait to go back to Charlotte to eat there again."}
{"text":"This was such a nice surprise! We have gone to this restaurnat a few ties now, and it always delivers. The chicken is melt in your mouth good! And the squash caserole out of this world. My daughter always has the jerk pork sandwich...and that does not disappoint either. And the pricing is very reasonable! From what I hear, you can order whole chickens to take home, too; although we haven't done that yet. If you like chicken, you can't go wrong ordering 1/4 or 1/2 with 2 sides. The new potatoes are great, and my daughter likes the cinnamon apples."}
{"text":"Go here now. Squash casserole is CRAZY. The chicken queso dish is fabulous. I've had a hard time finding something I don't love here. Everything tastes so fresh and fast service. Big portions as well."}
{"text":"Eat Drink RoCo! !! Great Food and atmosphere! !! Love it!## The chicken was excellent and the sides Great!!! Our plates where clean!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good but service is terrible. They are only friendly to customers they know. Others are ignored for a long time before being attended to"}
{"text":"I just love this place.  I have been eating here since 1995 and only wish that I lived closer so I could get here a couple of times per week.  I used to work a block away and did just that, but now it is probably once every couple of weeks.

My usual is 1/4 white, apples, and white beans au gratin, but I love the chicken and rice too.  The Roasting Company shows that good food, at a good value, served quickly will always find a happy market and they do a big business.  Nobody comes here for the parking, or the atmosphere--it is the yummy food."}
{"text":"For what they do, they do it really well.  Great eat n run kind of place.  Parking can be a challenge, but it's not the size of their lot, it's the quantity of people heading there for a midday meal.

Their claim to fame is their rotisserie chicken - they serve it in a variety of ways...... in a tortilla with rice and beans, over a salad, smothered in queso, with mayo in a chicken salad, etc.  I haven't had a bad chicken dish yet.  Portions are on the above-avg side.

They also have daily specials......CPP on Wednesdays is a solid choice, but my go-to special is the Meatloaf on Fridays.

Probably my favorite part of their menu is their side dishes.....squash casserole, mashed sweet potatoes, black beans, garlicky new potatoes, etc.  You can just order the veggie plate and walk out extremely satisfied.

Service is fast.....order at the counter, then they call your name to pick it up in a few minutes (sometimes your order is up before you finish paying).  

Nothing fancy about the decor, but it works."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Casual but cool, clean and up to date. Great for families or groups. My daughter and I shared the 10 wings which was just enough for our lite appetites. My husband had the marinated grilled chicken breast sandwich. It came with mayo, cheese, lettuce and tomato. He had the squash casserole for his side. He described it as good. My 9 year old son had the chicken taco kids meal with a side of chips and queso dip. The taco would have been enough for him. There was enough chips and queso that we all had a share and still had some to bring with us."}
{"text":"Wow this place is excellent! New to the area and checked this place out recently. People in the other reviews aren't kidding about their sauce and the squash casserole!"}
{"text":"I'm not 100% sure what the hype is about. The Roasting Company kind of falls under the \"comfort food\" category for me, but I've certainly had better comfort food in Charlotte. Admittedly, I didn't actually order any chicken. My pulled pork was pretty bland, even with the Jaco sauce on it. I had a side of mac and cheese, which was on par with any other mac and cheese out there. The highlight of my meal was the collard greens - well seasoned and tender. 

My group and I had a hard time finding a clean table. The restrooms were also a little dingy. I realize this is not an upscale establishment, but the place felt a bit grimy. 

While my experience was fairly mediocre, I can definitely see this being a great place to get drunk food in the middle of the night."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place several years ago at lunch time and thought I would stop in for take out since I was in the area yesterday!  Well, I seriously have had better chicken from a can.  YUCK! I got the Chicken on rice with Queso, the Queso was like water, the texture of the chicken was just weird.  The Squash casserole was okay, but not great.  I remember I used to love the smoked pasta salad, well it had a strong vinegar flavor that I do not remember.  Most of my 9$ lunch ended up in the trash."}
{"text":"Roasting Company is pretty good. Good value for the amount of food you get. I usually get the 1/4th chicken and it comes with cornbread and two sides. Cinnamon apples are a must.

Guy at the register is a bit eccentric and makes you feel slightly uncomfortable, but he is extremely nice and on point."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food I had the cinnamon apples with the Monterey Jack Chicken Wrap. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Date night with my sis at the bar.  Dinner and drinks on a Thursday evening.  Not packed, pleasant company from Jake the bartender and apparently a few locals who helped us pick our meals.  I went with the pork, which was very tasty.  My highlight was squash casserole.  Sooo good - I actually went home and attempted my own version which tasty, but not nearly as good.  Green beans could've used a bit more salt.  I ordered wings to go and they smelled heavenly, but my kids devoured them before I could try them and confirm if they're finger-licking.  I'll just assume yes. 
I did not know they were hiding a salsa station around the corner (where I think the take out is?).  Yup, that's the icing on the cake!  Or in this case, the salsa on the everything :)
Bathrooms were clean, music not too loud, full bar, local brews, service was on point.  Parking lot was full, but i easily found a spot on the street. Prices were fair and Ill be back for more of everything."}
{"text":"This place has been a staple in south Charlotte for somewhere close to 15 years now, and they're still kickin'. 

Rotisserie style chicken (moist and fresh, and seasoned perfectly) meets a kinda southwestern meets southern comfort food equals deliciousness. They offer a few rice and black bean plates, with or without queso. Also offered are a variety of vegetable side items, with daily specials- my favorite being the squash casserole. The collard greens are great too, as well as the smoked cheese and pasta salad.

Regardless of whAt you get, the portions are always generous and I find myself with leftovers for either a snack or dinner. 

Check out the jaco and tico sauces. They also have a salsa bar inside."}
{"text":"Good menu. Veggies, tacos, queso and chips are excellent. Used to love the chicken and queso over rice. The last couple of times the chicken was dry and they were stingy with the queso."}
{"text":"Hidden gem on Montford dr. near Park Rd. Shopping Center. The Chicken is great, the sides are fantastic, the queso dip is the best I have had !"}
{"text":"(Note, I've only been here once, but plan on going back...so this is a preliminary review!)

After several co-workers told me to give Roasting Company a try, I went in tonight on my dinner break, and wasn't disappointed!  

I had the  dark, with a side of their black beans and squash casserole.  (Though Wednesdays is famous for their Chicken Pot Pie...which I told myself I'd have next time, for sure.) Not only did the food come out quickly, it was pretty cheap, I think about $7 with tax total.  

The entrée came with a really nice piece of cornbread--moist and warm and slightly sweet.  It was wrapped in foil, I presume to keep the moistness.  Nice idea.  The beans were nicely seasoned, as was the chicken.  The chicken is definitely delicious, with a nice, crispy skin.  Waaaay better than a Boston Market chicken. 

But the star?

By far the squash casserole.  I know, connoisseurs of squash casserole will say \"Dion!  This yellow mush doesn't count!  Where is the squash!?\" because it really is more like stuffing, and mushy.  My co-worker, Devon and I were musing over what could be in it...we deducted butter and onions and breadcrumbs.  How can you not love it?

I particularly enjoyed the salsa bar, and the vinegar-y sliced white onions you can pile on your plate.  

The only thing that bothered me, was the crazy number of tables that weren't cleared off.  Plates with crusty remnants of food, dried on them.  There must have been 10 tables with dirty plates and half-eaten food on them.  The bathroom also featured clogged up toilets. 
Going on the food alone, I give this place 4 stars.  The selection is pretty good--with sides changing every day, and specials, like the pot pie on Wednesdays. 

 The prices are very reasonable, and the food comes out in about 5 minutes, if even.  A great alternative to fast-food...though they're going to have to work on keeping the place looking clean/nice.  

PS:  I like how they mark \"heart healthy\" choices with a star.  Nice touch."}
{"text":"I had not been here for over 15 years due to a relocation. I stopped in last week and it was like I never left. The food is absolutely delicious and the people are as nice as you can find. Best selection of sides, only complaint is I could not choose one so I had to choose 3 !!!!! Best Roasted Chicken I have ever eaten. Favorite sides are smoked cheese pasta and dil potation salad.  
Highly recommend, you will not be disapointed."}
{"text":"My coworker introduced me to the Roasting Company and I'm really glad about it. This place is awesome. It's great for a decent lunch or dinner. The food is tasty and the selection of sides is impressive. It's relatively cheap, as you will pay under $10 per meal/person. The workers are friendly and service is fast. Hooray for Roasting Company!!   :)"}
{"text":"WOW! The wife ordered the chicken and black bean combo con queso and I got the sante fe chili and rice. We also ordered and split 10 hot wings. The chicken and black bean combo con queso is boneless, skinless rotisserie chicken served over our herb rice and topped with queso which I have to say after tasting it my wife threatened to stab me with her fork if I tried to get anymore. The sante fe chili and rice was homemade beef chili served over rice and topped with our queso sauce. Man this stuff was stick to your ribs goodness. The wings were the type we loved which had a crispness to them and the sauce was divine. They have other sauces there to try which are also very yummy. We had a wonderful time there and will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Normally like the chicken queso on rice.  Today's was runny cheese on rice.

Get it together please."}
{"text":"When I lived nearby, I would eat here at least once a week.  You can't go wrong here.  The menu is centered on roasted chicken.   You can get it with Jaco sauce, black beans, whole chicken etc.  They have a large variety of sides that are just as good as the entrees.  It is a very fast-order at the counter type of place.  It is cheap, filling, and very tasty."}
{"text":"Still working the kinks out.  I went for the first time to this location after years of going to the one on Montford.  I called in and to my surprise it wasn't ready when I got there 25 minutes later.  Not to mention my order want even started.  When I did get my order it wasn't correct.  Hopefully they get their act together because it's a great space."}
{"text":"You know your meal is gonna be good when you can little smell deliciousness from the parking lot!

We decided to check out Roasting Company last night. It is right around the corner from our neighborhood and I can't believe we have never been here before!! You walk up to the ordering area, order, then wait for them to call your name. They have a seating area and a full bar. 

On the recommendations of another Yelpers review (thanks Marco!), we ordered the Chicken and Black Bean con Queso. This came with two sides and we got the collard greens and squash casserole. We also added on a side of potatoes. There were so many yummy sounding sides on the menu that it was hard to choose! 

We grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered a beer, while waiting for our food. The Triple C Baby Maker was on special for $3.50, which is an incredible deal! As this is one of my favs, beer wise, the choice was obvious! 

The food came out and was definitely plenty for two people! The squash casserole was by far the winner!! The chicken and black beans con queso was a nice portion and consisted of rice, black beans, chicken, a bbq like sauce, and cheese all chopped up. 

Definitely want to come back as they have daily specials for main courses and sides....mac n cheese, chicken pot pie, and chicken and dumplings were definitely some of the specials I want to return for!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the area.  It's my go to on the week days, weekend, and for my birthday.  

Friendly faces, late night food, the daily specials - ALWAYS worth eating.  Don't forget the sides, they're all to die for.  

Favorites:  Chicken Pot Pie, Cheesy Grits, Cornbread and Chili Tacos.

So much space, good for big parties, and if the line looks long, it goes quick.

LASTLY - get all the wings, taste them all.  They take longer, but only because they are delish."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu sounded delicious and I couldn't decide what to order. I ended up with enough food for five people just for me. Perfectly seasoned food and the portions were enough for left overs. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I love the big salads and the chicken and some of the vegetables. Great place to eat when you can't decide what you want to eat.

There is a separate bar area where you can order a drink but you better be willing to wait. The bartender has totally ignored me on two visits. I had to get my son to order my drink! Not sure whats up with the bar area but that is the reason for only 3 stars."}
{"text":"The roasting company is great, one of my favorite local spots for dining in or take out."}
{"text":"My favorite thing to get at the Roasting Company ...by far ...is their Chicken Pot Pie, they only make it on Wednesdays, and you might want to call in and order yours before noon, because they tend to run out pretty quick.  The chicken pot pie is amazing.  The crust is moist doughy and flaky with a unique spice flavor, and the chicken is tender and delicious.  I have had their wings as well as some regular orders of the chicken and all of those things are decent, but the one thing you must get here is the Chicken Pot Pie."}
{"text":"If it were possible to give less than one star I would. My husband and I ordered the Jacko pork with rice and sides. The pork was bland and the portion was less than a kid's portion. The veggies were also bland. I will never patronize this restaurant again. It is extremely disappointing to pay for food and get so little. I don't understand why this restaurant has a four star rating. The food is mediocre at best, I'm being kind."}
{"text":"I honestly don't get what the big deal is with this place... 

I've eaten here 2 - 3 times with coworkers who rave about it but it seems to me that its just a confused Boston market with lower quality food."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!  I wasn't even sure this place was open when I drove by it the first 1000 times but we finally decided to go in and give it a shot while getting the oil changed down the street.  Well worth it!  I had the rotisserie chicken sandwich and it was a MOUND of chicken with thier special jaco sauce on a bun with lettuce and tomato.  Definitely plenty...I couldn't eat it all.  The jaco sauce...which I was told contained soy, pineapple juice, honey, and worchestire sauce....tasted more like watered down soy all by itself.  It was so salty!  For my side, I had cheese grits and they were creamy, delicious, and a little spicy thanks to what I think were some green chiles.  All in all, good stuff, but next time, I will get the sauce on the side.  Oh!  For vegetarians, this is a dream....they have at least 10 veggies on their side menu, plus specials of the day.  Veggie plates all around!"}
{"text":"I have been searching for a proper chicken pot pie since the weather got colder & saw here on Yelp that the Roasting Co had chicken pot pies on Wednesdays.  Clearly, I had to check it out.  I did get it to go, so I can't say much on the restaurant itself, other than it's surprisingly roomy inside.  

Their chicken pot pies don't mess around.  The thing is massive!   It's chock full of veggies & perfectly moist chicken with a thin golden crust.  My only complaint is there's not as much crust as I would like, but it's still a great pot pie.  Can't wait to go back & check out what else they have to offer!

Also, they have Uncle Scott's Root Beer from Mooresville.  Best Root Beer I've tasted."}
{"text":"I'm giving them three stars based on service, and what my fiends had. I unfortunately got the rotisserie chicken sandwich. In their defense I should've paid better attention to the description..it was shredded chicken with \"jaco\" sauce (which is BBQ sauce). It was what they said it would be..just sounded way better on the menu. But bad idea for a sandwich. The bottom bun was so soggy & heavy that it literally fell apart when I attempted to pick it up. It was at best an ok sandwich. The collard greens were meh, I've had WAY better. However my friends got a chicken wrap that looked ridiculous, and they said it was. So I'd give the food another chance. 

The bar service was on time! We went to see one of our favorite local bands play, WICKED POWERS! Luckily for us they had $3 natty green drafts..yes please! The bartenders were quick & knowledgable. They only serve local on draft, not sure about bottled."}
{"text":"Wonderful food with plenty of options. Ample parking. New Central location doesn't disappoint. Friendly bar service. Seriously love this place. Great place to bring anyone with ability to impress while keeping it low key. Tables inside or sit at the bar and watch football. There's also an outside area with overhead door that opens up to parking lot. Great addition to Plaza Midwood."}
{"text":"This place is a gem in Charlotte. My friends are always raving about the chicken here and it does not disappoint. 

Friendly service and a huge selection of delicious dishes will have you coming back for more. Chicken is a favorite here but you really cannot go wrong, everything on the menu is fantastic. Wednesday's are chicken pot pie days so you will definitely want to come then! It takes a bit longer to get the chicken pie as they are baked on demand and they may run out before the end of the night.

I gave this place 4/5 solely based on the food pick up on busy nights, the wait is long and it gets confusing on whose order is what. If they could streamline that process this place would be spot on!"}
{"text":"The value here is outstanding.  They have the tastiest chicken and I'm really baffled by some of the reviewer's who didn't like it.  I lived in Charlotte the past three years and ate here frequently.   The squash casserole and buttered spinach are my favorite sides and the cornbread - YUM!"}
{"text":"There have been some other eateries popping up right down the street on Montord, but this remains a gem. As someone who tries to eat semi-healthy and likes variety with my meal, this is the ideal place. And it's pretty affordable, in the $8-$10 range.

The main event here is chicken, with a bit of a latin twist. You can go the traditional Southern route with both how you get your rotisserie and the sides you choose. I like a little flavor kick, so I went with the Chicken and Black Bean combo, served over rice with that tangy jaco sauce. If you want to splurge calorically a bit, you can get the same thing with queso.

You can go sandwich style, or go for the platter. The platter is a great value, as it comes with cornbread and your choice of endless sides. You can sub in some tortillas if you want to tilt your meal further to the South.

There are many tasty sides, including mac and cheese, greens and many other staples. I went with the garlicky new potatoes and the special stir fry mix of vegetables, which included broccoli and squash. The veggies were fresh, and the potatoes were creamy. It will probably take a long time before you can try out every side here, but I really don't think you can wrong with any combo.

I like the fact that you order up front, and they yell out your name when it's ready, and be warned, the food gets ready fast. The only question with seating was the lighting, but then again, I think we kind of picked a bad spot and could have moved to a more open area. The soft drinks are only $1.25, and it's easy access for refills of soda. As someone who loves to experiment with sauces, I really dig the fresh salsa bar. That pico de gallo is spicy and excellent.

Overall, this is a great place. It always seems to be packed, so come during the slightly off-peak dining hours so you can order, find yourself a seat and be served quickly. As someone who lives in the 'hood, I look forward to many happy returns."}
{"text":"I'm a slacker for not writing these guys a review, did not realize I had not done so already!  Anyways, our office treated us to lunch here and it was fabulous as always!

I have had the pot pie - which is a special on Wednesday or Thursday, I think??  It had great flavor and it is HUGE!  I think it took me 3 days to finish.  My go to meal though has turned into the chicken on rice with con queso, which is what I had today.  The chicken has great flavor and of course so does the con queso.  My favorite sides are the squash casserole and the baked apples.  Large portions create for multiple lunches or sharing!

One other one that I have tried is the chicken and queso wrap - I think it is called this?  You are better off just getting the chicken with rice and queso, it is the same stuff stuffed in a wrap and it is huge - too much to hold in you hand and it falls apart.  Not sure about the other wraps, but to me, just avoid the wraps and ask for tortillas on the side of your meal to make your own small wrap.

Always have had great fast service and great food.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Best meal. Great chicken, great veggies. Cheap. I came in hungry and left full with leftovers.... And only payed $9
Cool bar and good beer selection."}
{"text":"With a chicken as their logo, RoCo didn't seem like it would a great spot for a vegetarian. However, I was thrilled to discover their MANY veggie sides which make for a great lunch. And the prices are UNREAL. You can get three sides with a piece of cornbread for ~$5. That's incredible! It's such a perfect lunch spot for the Plaza crowd.
The staff is friendly and will walk you through the menu if you're unfamiliar. The restaurant itself is enormous and there's tons of space, including a large bar. It will be interesting to see what kind of evening crowd this pulls! I think this is going to become a Plaza staple."}
{"text":"Man, I have been coming here forever, since I was a youngster, and I have eaten the exact same thing every single time!!!  The two soft tacos platter with a veggie on the side is definitely my main jam.  It's a cheap meal (under $6 as far as I can remember), perfect place for a quick lunch or take-out.

I flood my tacos with their signature \"Tico Sauce\" and savor every moment of it.  The atmosphere in there is cool, I love the tall booths and dub music.

If you're a vegetarian, they have a really super selection for veggie plates.  The white beans au gratin, squash casserole, black bean salad, smoked cheese & pasta... dare I go on?

It's the kind of place where you order & grab your meal at the counter, so there isn't a waitstaff, but my folks taught me well by always leaving a dollar on the table in appreciation for the busser's hard work."}
{"text":"How did I let so much time pass between visits to this place?!  The chicken and black bean combo is an absolute favorite.  Add in a couple of tasty sides, and a cornbread muffin, and I am one satisified (and stuffed) puppy!

Am I the only one who ponders copping a bottle of their sauce(s)?"}
{"text":"Not your typical sit-down kind of restaurant.  You stand in line (lines can get LONG at lunch), give your order to the cashier and then pick up your meal when they yell out your name.  The staff shuffles an enormous amount of clientele through the place at lunch (dinner is substantially slower) but is helpful when needed and remembers the regulars.  

It's possibly my favorite lunchtime destination EVER.  I am currently a vegetarian but I've been eating here since my carnivore years.  (The chicken and black bean combo was excellent!)  My go-to order is the vegetarian combo, a mixture of rice, black beans, Jaco sauce (can only be explained as a cross between barbecue sauce and soy sauce...but that doesn't really work because, trust me, I've tried to recreate it at home!), cheese and chopped onions.  I always get the smoked gouda pasta salad...although there is no way that could be construed as good for me.  It's Nirvana on a plate!  All of the vegetables are delicious...daily specials disappear quickly!"}
{"text":"My friend checked this place and there are lot of good reviews. So we tried it. Big mistake. The food has no taste. Drink if you want flavor."}
{"text":"My girls and I were out and about on the  town today and decided to have a pre Mother's day lunch. We pulled up the Yelp app and the Roasting Company came up. Not sure what we were getting into, but we were ready for the challenge. As we drove up we noticed that the restaurant was pretty laid back and inviting. In this place you are the waitress. You put in your order at the window and wait for your name to be called for pick up. It's was almost like my mom calling me to dinner. All utensils napkins and drinks were at your disposal. This was odd, but I found it pretty cool and different. The food was great and piping hot. I ordered the 1/4 roasted chicken which was delicious. The pasta and cheese salad was the bomb! The greens were a little to tart for my taste ( just a table spoon or two of sugar will cut the bitterness) other wise my lunch was great. My daughter's  had the chicken and rice with black beans. They absolutely loved it. They had a variety of sides which consisted of yams, cornbread dressing, bake beans and potato salad. All were good, however the cornbread dressing was to sweet. Regardless, we had a ball and I will be back."}
{"text":"Favorite place in the area. Living legend. The southern BBQ wrap is actually phenomenal and it had a great bar. Also serves food late.would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Need to come here more often,  excellent rotisserie chicken, juicy and hot with awesome sides.  Dill potato salad is super creamy and baked beans are saucy with a hint of green pepper are my favorite ones, plenty more and some daily options.  Nice bar, this visit is way over due for a great eatery on a street with options, this is one of the best.  Cornbread muffins, you need more than one."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I've had the Monterey Chicken Wrap several times, and it never disappoints. I would give it five stars, if the gentlemen behind the counter tonight would have not talked crap about me not tipping on my takeout order. Just like most of the world, I don't tip on takeout orders unless they are delivered or overly complicated. Furthermore, it's rude to complain within an earshot of your customers. Just sayin'"}
{"text":"I had a layover for about 10 hours in North Carolina and I stop by this little place. What impressed me was the chicken pot pie. Unfortunately they had just ran out of it. I instead got the chicken with rice AND queso. With the corn bread dressing and green beans. They chicken with rice was amazing and so was the corn bread Dressing!!! The green beans not so much. Over all the beer was good and so was the food."}
{"text":"Great roast chicken & sweet potatoes plate! The RoCo standard food is delicious and reasonably priced. The new location is comfortable and nice decorations and lots of good local brews. The location is in the middle of plaza.  It's easy to imagine the outside in summer being a fun hangout. I like the food and the relaxing vibe. Parking is in the lot and easy to find in plaza, not typical.  Good chicken dinner for everyone!"}
{"text":"We were in Charlotte for one night after a 10 day vacation, this place was close and had good reviews. We wanted something fast and good before heading to the airport early. The atmosphere is nice, good beer selection and plenty of TV's to watch football.  The food on the other hand was uninspiring and bland. The chicken was dry, the rice had parts that were not completely cooked. The greens were very bland, but salvageable with pepper sauce. The new potatoes and squash casserole were decent.  If I lived here I would only return for beer."}
{"text":"Fast, good, cheap chicken...
Quarter, half or full size...great flavor
Sides, sides, sides...mac & cheese, casserole, sweet potato casserole, etc etc.

Most items are under $10. Food comes out in less than 5 minutes and you can sit inside or outside. This place is great for lunch or for dinner by yourself or with friends or family. Bowling alley and movie theater are close by making this a great place for a fast, inexpensive meal!"}
{"text":"When I was first invited to eat at The Roasting Company with friends, I hadn't heard of it before, but I was up for it.  When we got there, I thought, \"Are you kidding?  It looks like a dive.\"  Once we entered, though, you could immediately tell that it wasn't a dive.  It just has the poor luck of being in what appears to be an old small strip mall.  

It's a good idea to pick up one of the menus as you walk in (and before you step up to the ordering counter) because there's a lot to choose from!  Their speciality is rotisserie chicken with a Mexican or Tex-Mex flair.  My favorite dish is the chicken and black bean combo con queso.  Why?  It's chicken, two sides/veggies, black beans, and cheese.  YUM.  Top that with one of their hot sauces and I've got a double YUM.  Now comes the difficult part:  deciding which two side items from the list of about 15.    Garlic or mashed potatoes?  Spinach?  White bean au gratin?  Baked apples?  AARGH.  I can't decide!  They all sound so good.  I've tried several over different visits and I can tell you that they're ALL good.  That makes it even tougher to decide. 

The dining room is pretty casual and not overly themed, but i like the high-backed booths for some privacy."}
{"text":"Bones bones and more bones!! Warning to those who shovel food into their mouth with food that SHOULD be boneless. More likely than not, your chicken con queso or chicken pot pie will have numerous bones in them. While their food is tasteful, it may be hazardous to your life !! This photo is a chicken con queso over rice which SHOULD be boneless. This is not an isolated case. Happens every visit. They should put warning signs on these plates!"}
{"text":"The service was ok, we had some really rude service staff and at the same time some really nice service at the end. I had the black bean taco, it barely had any flavor. It was basically a tortilla and beans, nothing special and the ratio was definitely off. I would not recommend. However my husband got the bbq taco and he said they were really good. Overall mediocre."}
{"text":"Chicken Roasting Company is like your favorite pair of old jeans- soft, comfy, faded, make your butt look good (ok maybe a bit far). Anyway, it's the place you can go when you're so hungry you can't make up your mind what you want to eat. The place is casual, comfy and has quick counter service. There are a few outside tables, and a big tv always on sports. It's good for kids too.

The menu focuses on, er, chicken. My favorite is 1/4 white, With 2 sides. That means a 1/4 of a rotisserie roasted chicken (you can also get dark of even a half a chicken). each day in addition to their great regular sides, they  have a few special sides. My favorite special side is the spicy Mac & cheese only on Saturdays, but their regular sides of Tico black beans (which keeps turning into Ticonderoga on my iPad -DYAC!!), cornbread stuffing, sautéed veggies and mashed sweet potatoes are also great. In fact, the mashed sweet potatoes taste like pumpkin pie. Mmm, pie...There are some sides I don't love as much, so just find what you like. 

The menu also offers a couple entrees like chicken and rice, wraps (veggie wrap is good but is juicy so maybe ask to go light on the dressing or on the side) all for very reasonable prices. The 1/4 white plate is $6.80. It is equally friendly to the pocketbook and the stomach.  The only problem? I don't live as close to Park & Woodlawn anymore, so it's not as convenient. 

Bottom line: great place to get a solid meal for not much moolah when you're in your sweats."}
{"text":"How to go from first to worst in six short months.  There once was a time when this place served the best food in the city.  They have a new person working in their kitchen who is single-handedly destroying their business.  I have had to send back every plate of food this creep has prepared.  Today will be the last time I will visit this establishment.  I have made my displeasure known on several occasions - to no avail.  I kept coming back hoping the quality would improve.  I used to look forward to coming to the Roasting Company, now I find myself repulsed - all because of one crappy employee.  If you decide to eat here, I'd advise avoiding anything that is made with rice - unless you enjoy rice swimming in an excessive amount of  yucky, milky, buttery film!  WTF is that junk?  Who trained this idiot?  I'd give ZERO STARS if it was an option."}
{"text":"Delicious local delicacy. Great spot on Montford for a quick bite or a lazy afternoon. Awesome - easy to spot- selection of gluten-free options. Full bar. Nice patio. One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Tried out the new location today.  The place is convenient and parking is ample compared to the Montford Dr location.  The interior is light with plenty of seating in dining area and at the bar.   I was happy with the quick but helpful service and waited no more than 5 minutes for my buffalo chicken sandwich and side of black eyed peas.  Glad to have Roco in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time at RoCo and I now understand why people love it so much! The restaurant is in a great location, there's an awesome indoor/outdoor space and the staff is exactly what you hope for when visiting this type of place. Jade was our bartender, she made an awesome cocktail (I recommend the one with kombucha) and was super helpful when it was time to order. I ordered the chicken and rice con queso with a side of collards. Overall the food was good, we did send back the collards because they were bitter and overcooked but everything else was yummy and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Very good and very consistent!!! Sides have no meat unless specified, which is great for Vegetarians, or ppl who just want to know what they are putting in their mouths.  Their roasted chicken is awesome and they are generous. 
 This is a quick place to eat and casual. You place your order, grab food when your names called, etc. 
 I haven't sampled the bar, yet- but there's always hope. Lol. Looks good. 
 Also, this place offers service with a smile and a large variety of sides! Huge meal, veggie plate or sandwich/wrap combo. No fries, but you won't miss them.  
 The only thing if any, that I'd change would be, a dessert or two, but even then, they offer a few daily, until gone. All good. You will get your money's worth and a full tummy!"}
{"text":"It has been years since I have actually eaten here, but I stopped in for some beers with some friends last night and the vibe hasn't changed one bit.  Nothing fancy, but friendly and quick service was all I was looking for.

I don't know that I have much to say here, since I didn't get any food.  A great place to grab some beers.  Some awesome $3.50 beer specials."}
{"text":"I assume RoCo and Coal Trane's didn't discuss their rotisserie chicken plans with each other before opening.  Similar business plans within view of each other.

It's RoCo.  It doesn't feel quite like the Montford one.  I hate to say it, but its \"too clean\"?  I don't know it feels pushed, doesn't have that dive'ish hometown feel.  Beer selection ain't all that for my taste either.  That said, I was pretty sober when I went.  I'm pretty sure the first time I go in there at 1am with a buzz I'll come back and fix this to a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Best prepared food for the money in Charlotte period. Now with a great porch and local beer bar, do not visit Charlotte and miss this joint. 5 stars all around."}
{"text":"RoCo as the locals call it offers some delicious roasted chicken and other Southern specialties.  The day my coworkers and I visited was chicken pot pie day.  Naturally, we opted for the special and it was definitely delicious.  It is piping hot, so use caution when eating.  Nice large chunks of chicken breast, peas, carrots, and potatoes are baked into a medium sized aluminum take out container with a crispy crust topping everything.
Super delicious, especially, with their habanero hot sauce.

Will return to try their roast chicken next time!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been in years. Now there is a bar. Food is frozen in time - same exact stuff as ten years ago. Mediocre."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch with my coworkers and the place was packed! But lucky for us the line moved quickly. 

I chose the Monterey Wrap. First, it's huge! Trust me...you'll have a really hard time finishing all of it!

Second, they do not skimp on the chicken or toppings. This wrap had chicken, black beans, rice, onions and peppers and the best part - they top all that with queso! I really loved the flavor of the rotisserie chicken. So tender and flavorful! For my side I chose the white bean au gratin. It was very tasty as well! I was stuffed and happy and you can't ask for more than that! 

All in all this is a pretty solid lunch spot. I definitely look forward to trying more of the menu items."}
{"text":"One of my fave places in Charlotte! My parents have been eating here since it opened and i've known about it forever. I always love taking people who have never been there bc they are always so pleased with how awesome the food is!

Just a few of my favorite things!
Smoked Cheese and Pasta (pasta salad) - It's my absolute favorite!!! I cant come here and not order that. It's tangy, creamy, and just awesome.

The Wings - Order them traditional and get them with extra sauce... who doesnt like extra sauce? For dunking, pouring, taking shots...whatever...it's delicious.

Chicken and Queso over Rice - AMAZING. And get jalapenos added to the top. 

Tico Sauce - this stuff is the bomb.com! Vinegary, Tangy, a little Spicy... and perfect for everything they have. Put it on your chicken with queso.. put it on your salad. Ordered tacos? Put it on that too. Also, if you crave it all the time like i do, just buy a bottle and take it home!!! Yummmmmm

The summary of this review would be - JUST GO EAT THERE NOW. :) You wont be sorry. And they totally have a bar now - so drink up!"}
{"text":"Almost wish I didn't work Uptown because this is a great lunch spot. They have a surprisingly large menu including everything from rotisserie chicken plates to taco salads.

Order at the register and wait for your name. They have a large dining area and some porch seating. Perfect for groups or individuals. Super quick, inexpensive, and delicious.

As for the food, I enjoyed my meal but was underwhelmed with my choice. The chicken and rice con queso was good, but the rice was bland in my opinion. Disclaimer: not a big white rice lover. But the chicken and queso and cornbread were on point. Next time I'll go the rotisserie chicken plate route.

Eager to try this place again, just wish it was closer to me."}
{"text":"I've been loving the Roasting Company since I would tag along with my parents and eat there as a kid. Carribean music and vibe, good beer specials, and really delicious chicken. 

I always go for the 1/4th white meal, but I've had the dark and it's delicious also. The chicken and rice con queso, monterey chicken wrap and chicken and black bean combo are also awesome choices. Go for the tico black beans, garlicky new potatoes, collard greens or cinnamon apples for sides - the stir fry veggies and white bean au gratin are a little bland compared to the rest of the selections. If you happen to come in when the mac and cheese or stewed okra and tomatoes are on special, definitely try those out as well.

The cashiers at the counter are always friendly and I've never left this place hungry. Perfect."}
{"text":"The beer selection...The majority is IPA. Like the majority of local restuarants, the only amber is omb copper. The food is like a cafeteria. The staff though is great. Just not enough interest to go back. If only they balanced the beer options, I'd come back."}
{"text":"This is one of those \"regular\" places for me. I make a 10 mile, one-way, drive to enjoy the Jaco Pork on Rice with squash casserole, and collard greens. The chicken is what they are known for and I enjoy that too. The portions are good, the price is right, the atmosphere is relaxed. You can't go wrong here for a good meal."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time tonight for dinner. I sat at the bar with 2 friends and although I personally don't choose the bar for dinner it was a great experience. To start, we ordered margaritas. I give the margaritas a 5/5 (highly recommend). For dinner I ordered chicken on rice con queso with baked beans and squash casserole. I enjoyed everything but the squash casserole. It's possible that I'm not into squash casserole. The meal with 2 sides was only $10. For the option of macaroni I would pay $12. Please please add Mac n cheese to the menu  I got a to go plate for my husband with collard greens and baked beans. We will be back"}
{"text":"My first and last visit at the Roasting company was a terrible experience.

called in a take out order Sunday 9/24, around 5PM, and was told it would be ready in 45 minutes.

Arrived to pay and pick it up 55 minutes later, and the order was NOT ready. Waited for 10 additional minutes there and it still was NOT ready. The girl at the cash register didnt seem to be bothered with this at all, like it was normal. 

Several other customer hanging around waiting were grumbling about how long it was taking to get their food.

Got refund and went to Midwood Smokehouse 3 blocks away and was out the door with my food in 10 minutes.

Lack of interest and concern by the staff was obvious."}
{"text":"Overwhelming smell of bleach as soon as you walk in the door.  No way I could eat with that smell.  I had to turn around and walk out..."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch after reading the Yelp reviews and having to be in Charlotte on business. The first thing I'll say is that the parking is easy and that is always a plus when you are going somewhere you've never been. The restaurant is one in which you  pay and order at the register and then you wait and they call your name and you take your food to a table. Most of us order the 1/4 chicken, which came with corn bread and a side. This was the perfect size meal for lunch and is priced appropriately. Our orders came out quickly and we took a great table by the windows. The food was delicious. The staff is very pleasant and hard working. I will certainly return."}
{"text":"The good: Friendly staff, nice decor and great beer selection.

The bad: the food reminded me of what you would expect from a southern buffet, not completely terrible, but nothing special either. 

The bottom line is that I won't be back, because I can cook better than this at home."}
{"text":"Chicken was actually cooked completely done ( so many places rush the meat :/)  and moist; however lacked umph. Good chicken-not as flavorful as Viva. The sides here are more variety than the usual french fries&mashed potatoes. We love black beans!The squash casserole and smoked cheese pasta salad were yummy.  The spinach in the pasta salad was an unexpected pleasant surprise.  Corn muffins had real bits of corn. The place is like McAlister's where you order and leave your name. Get your food and leave your plates. Nothing fancy and sometimes that is a good thing :) So I can only speak on service of cashier. She was efficient and cordial.  Prices are very affordable and under $11 per entree. Will add to our dining out rotation."}
{"text":"When I lived in Charlotte I use to eat here at least once a week as this was near my office.  The interior restaurant has changed in the last couple of years which was a much needed renovation.

Tip:  Thursday - do your self a favor and get the chicken and dumplings!  You can't go wrong with that choice.  It is heaven in a LARGE cup!

Prices have gone up but still well worth the value.  Their chicken is ALWAYS fresh and there are so many different variations.

They now have a bar area if you have a moment to grab some however I never have since I have been on business on every trip.

This is mostly a self service including drinks.  You order, pickup when your name is called and sit and enjoy the food that melts in your mouth.

I am and will be a fan for years to come anytime I make it back to CLT"}
{"text":"Very bland food, no flavor.  Unimpressed. Quiet atmosphere. Will not be return."}
{"text":"Had a yummy, hearty dinner here last night.  The chicken and rice was recommended by the cashier, with a hearty sample. The chicken was so tender, it fell apart with a spoon! The jaco sauce was wowzers good!  I had a squash casserole which was topped and baked with breadcrumbs and was delish, however I didn't care too much for the basil green bens, that were mushy and tasted out of a can.  The service is counter order and self service, but they didn't have any trays, which made carrying dishes and drinks, and grabbing utensils a treacherous trip from the open kitchen counter to the table.  
Will look forward to returning and trying out other dishes!"}
{"text":"Must have. Squash casserole. Mashed sweet potatoes. And the Monterrey chicken wrap. My hubby's favorite lunch in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I wish I liked their food a little more, especially after reading all the awesome reviews of this place.  I got the chicken with rice, queso, and black beans with a side of sweet potato fries and a cornbread muffin.  It just wasn't packed with flavor the way I was expecting it to be.  The chicken part was kind of bland and definitely needed to be spiced up a bit.  Don't order their sweet potato fries if you're expecting them to be drizzled with a sweet or honey glaze.  I actually prefer mine salty but the pepper they add to their fries really threw me off.  The cornbread muffin wasn't too bad but it didn't stand up to my high cornbread standards.

I liked that the food came out pretty fast.  I also enjoyed the casual dining area. I was a little confused when we were finished eating because I had no idea what to do with my plate and glass.  This place doesn't have servers that come to the table so I was searching for a trash can to throw my stuff away but didn't see one.  We saw some other people leave before us that just left their used plates on the table so we followed suit.

I might come back to try out a different entree.  Hopefully this place has really good food and I just chose the wrong menu items."}
{"text":"This spot was recommended by Marissa at the hotel for a really good gluten free home cooked meal and microbrews. And yes, several delicious gluten free beer options including an IPA (very rare). It was better than expected or hoped for and the staff was wonderful! We had a really wonderful, fairly priced gluten free meal and microbrew!"}
{"text":"Most native Charlotteans know about this hidden little gem of a place... they have wonderful rostissere chicken, flavorful black beans and great cornbread. They also have good chicken and dumplings which may not be on the regular menu but are sometimes the special of the day.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Roasting Company on numerous occasions; that being said, feel free to take this review for what it's worth.

The Roasting Company just does not have the best food.  My co-worker loves this place, so we go at least once every two weeks.  I on the other hand am not a huge fan of their menu and how they prepare their foods.

At this place, you order your food at the counter.  Once your meal is ready (under three minutes in my experience), your name is called to pick up your plate.  One can opt to eat either inside or outside on their patio.  There are no trash cans; I leave my food on my table when I'm done...but I'm not waited on by anyone.  Am I expected to leave a tip...?

I have ordered a number of sandwiches and wraps from The Roasting Company.  The presentation of the entrées could not be better, however the quality and taste are negligible.  If you order a sandwich or wrap with any sort of sauce on it, you'll find that they include so much of it that your sandwich just falls apart and you make one hell of a mess.  Even on a sandwich without sauce, the chicken is so juicy to the point that the bread will act as a sponge and absorb all of it.  Nothing irks me more than soggy bread.  As for the taste, there is nothing special about their menu; you could make the same items at home (and likely not force yourself to contend with all the sog!).

I give them two stars for their killer sweet potato fries, despite the fact that they only make them on days of their choosing."}
{"text":"Love the food, great atmosphere, great beer selection. I wish there were a few more options on the menu, but other than that I enjoyed it. My family and I have ate there a few times now and I have tried various things on the menu and have enjoyed each dish. I wish they had a few more barbecue sauce options for the pulled pork, It was a little bland. The chicken wings were outstanding and I was happy to see that they had blue cheese dressing, which was very tasty I must add. Standing in line waiting for your food is a little awkward, and you half to go up to the bar if you want to order a beer. They ring it up separately from the register for the food. Kind of a pain in the neck. Minus my few mentioned pet peeves, the place is outstanding and I give them 4.5 stars.."}
{"text":"Always a great meal. I'm not a slaw person but theirs is the best. Kitchen stays open till 2am!!!!! Yay. I tasted the pineapple casserole.....omg. Divine delicious confusion on the taste buds."}
{"text":"After a wry glance at each other after a workout, my wife and I decided it wasn't going to be a night we cooked in. I had passed by The Roasting Company a few times and had heard good things offhand, so I figured we would give it a try since it is right around the corner from where I live. Overall we had a great experience, pigged out on some delicious dishes, and enjoyed the laid back atmosphere.

Walking in is a little disorienting, as you have to go to the right and place your order. Almost all the dishes are inspired by their slow roasted rotisserie style chicken, which creates an intoxicating aroma as you pull into the parking lot. We ended up ordering the Chicken con Queso with sides of collards, squash casserole (our favorite!), and garlicky potatoes. In a style reminiscent of the backwoods eastern barbecue places I frequent back home, you wait for them to holler your name, then you smirk at everyone still waiting for their food as you make your way back to your table with your overloaded plate. 

We ended up sitting at the bar and getting CCC's baby maker on special for $3.50 (FYI it's much more expensive if you buy it at the brewery). We weren't too terribly hungry so we split the meal, which was a great choice as they don't skimp out on portions. Overall everything was prepared wonderfully and I liked all of the selections we had made. Also for the price, you are getting a pretty good bang for your buck IMO. While the main dish was awesome, the sides stole the show. They always have around 20 sides available, so I look forward to trying some different ones in the future.

Fun Fact - If you aren't sold yet, it is also one of Luke Kuechly's favorite places to eat. He considers it a pre-game ritual to eat there the week before the game, and blames the Atlanta loss on his not dining at The Roasting Company for the first time that season. Not to worry though, The Roasting Company made sure to send him a bottle of their Tico sauce so he could keep the tradition before the Super Bowl. You can read the article in the Charlotte Observer."}
{"text":"Same great RoCo, new location. 

My wife and I popped in here with our dog late on a Monday night after we were still starving from a sub par experience at the peculiar rabbit. The new space is certainly neat with a covered outdoor area that is dog friendly, a huge bar inside, and surprising expansive seating considering the location. We were able to grab some of our favorites (rice chicken and beans with Tico sauce, squash casserole, red oak drafts) with huge portions at a decent price. The big upside of this place is they are open super late even on a Monday when most everything else is shut down. 

Overall, great job with the new space and I'm glad to know I can grab some of my favorite comfort food when I'm on the other side of town!"}
{"text":"OK Peeps, let's get it straight-this place is not Tex-Mex or Jamaican, its Costa Rican style food.  Whenever you see \"tico\" on anything, it refers to Costa Rica.  Plus cornbread made from heaven and collard greens for randomness.

When I visited RC, I was suprised by the daring mix of Costa Rican food and Southern food.  The smell of rotisserie chicken makes my heart sing, anyway, but it was even better to eat.  For around $8, I got an entire meal of rotisserie chicken, black beans, and spinach.  I ordered spinach to be healthy (must have been sick or something) and was shocked at how good  it tasted!  Not to mention the chicken...

This place is very homely-located above a rowdy Karaoke bar.  I applaud them for being so deliciously weird.  A salsa bar (as in sauce for tortilla chips, not the music), collard greens, mac n cheese, and tico beans?  The clientèle is awesomely mixed as well, young, old, hip and square.  This place is proof that Charlotte does have its own gastronomical character."}
{"text":"Great vegetables, even though baked apples is a fruit. I've tried the chicken and the pork dishes and love them all."}
{"text":"Its a Charlotte staple, a locally owned business, the stop that's outlasted every venue on Montford.  I've been coming to Roasting Co since I was in middle school, in my 30's now I still stop in monthly.  The food is still classic, the establishment has grown.  Full bar with a few TV's for sports, amazing fresh roasted chicken, and some homemade hot sauce.  Go on Wednesday, get the daily special Chicken Pot Pie, it will feed two.  Take home a cup of queso and chips, it will make you fat and happy.  Buy a tee shirt, support the fam.  Any other questions, stop in to get the answers."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite and had forgotten how great the good tastes. Hubby had pork and rice, garlicky potato and turnip greens, I had 1/4 chicken, spicy mac n cheese and stir fry veggies.  YUM!  We finished all of it and washed it down with Imperial Beer from Costa Rica which was the first time I had found it in the states.  It's a bit noisy if there are families there, although it did not matter to us once you start eating."}
{"text":"Local craft beer and sweet corn bread with jalapeño in it!? Wow this place has it going on!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately ROCO is truly overhyped in my opinion. 

The booths have no cushion so are somewhat uncomfortable. 

If you are lazy (like me) you have to pick up your own food. 

I ordered the chicken and queso over rice with a side of sweet mashed potatoes, everything lacked flavor. My friend ordered potatoes, green beans, a pasta salad and squash casserole and everything lacked flavor expect the pasta salad which was delicious. Even the corn bread was somewhat dry. 

The service is the reason I gave it two stars, very helpful and energetic."}
{"text":"My favorite place on Montford right now because of the jalapeño pale ale from bird song brewery on tap. Also the portions are huge, definitely one of the best home cooking type placing around South Charlotte."}
{"text":"Would have gotten 5-stars except that my entrées never come out the same twice. Nice atmosphere and bar area, but you better pray you get a good, consistent chef the day that you eat there. On one visit my rotisserie chicken salad was one of the best I've ever had, the next it was missing key components and embodied food from a public school cafeteria.  Also, the salsa bar gets a little picked over sometimes and could use a couple more restocks throughout the day."}
{"text":"Based on the friend who took me to lunch here, as well as the full parking lot, I was expecting this place to be the best thing on earth.  Overall I can't complain.  The food was good.  They give you real plates and silverware, but yet it still feels casual and fun.  The prices were fair.  However, I was not blown away.  I got the 1/2 chicken with sweet potato fries,  The chicken had good flavor, but was a little tough and I could see this being replicated at most any casual dining place.  The fries were average and lacked that \"something\" that makes sweet potato fries different than regular fries.  The best thing on the plate was the cornbread - a real star here.  

One thing I really liked was the high backed booths, which made you feel like you were the only people in the restaurant, even when full.  Even with this, though, the acoustics were of such where it was hard to have a conversation, and the music was a bit loud.  

I really want to come back and try some of their more \"tex mex\" type dishes.  My friend works near this place, so I feel this is a reason why he
has grown to appreciate it more.  It is good, but not worth going out of the way for."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of hype on this chicken place and was excited to try it and when we got their the casual and fun feeling was nice, the menu looked great...but the roast chicken just didn't have any flavor/seasoning/taste under the skin!  I was disappointed in the lack of flavor to the chicken meat itself.  Also the sides were hit or miss, some were good, some  were too salty or too sweet.  I'll pass on this place...I like Viva Chicken better...I don't need the bar atmosphere as much as I need good tasty food!"}
{"text":"Finally came back during peak lunch time instead of 3 pm and figured it out.  I usually headed straight to the bar which is full-service, but for everyone else it is counter service.  All the more reason to sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"Just went there the other day for the first time, and thought it was pretty good! Also-they have retractable doors right near the bar-it will be a fun local place to hangout and grab a drink with friends once things warm up:)"}
{"text":"This place is very much worth the drive. I had half white  Rotisserie I have 3 sides with it season corn collard greens and squash casserole. This food was so good it's all organic and they have some interesting sauces at the table try the tico sauce. The tico sauce with the chicken was excellent. And I must say the price is very fair they even offer a for side dishes platter before 5 dollars and 49 cents you can't beat that. I will be coming back here to eat again."}
{"text":"Great selection of local brews. Food was fast and delicious. Atmosphere was casual, comfortable, and classy. All around perfection!"}
{"text":"A first time visit but definitely not the last.  I ordered the roasted chicken & black beans con queso and was more than pleased with the flavor and portion.  The bartender, Eli, was attentive and his suggestion to try the squash casserole was spot on.   If you are seeking a relaxed atmosphere & great food, check out The Roasting Company."}
{"text":"As a Charlotte Native, RoCo is always on the top of my list of recommendations for Charlotte newcomers. I'm one of those boring people who order the same order (chicken, rice, queso) every time, but have been occasionally swayed by some outstanding specials. Don't sleep on the buffalo chicken wrap if it's available. 

Let's talk sides: if you're a collard green person, get the collard greens. If you pretend like you're not a collard green person, try these. They are the way God intended collard greens to taste. If they have the mac and cheese: get it! 

The inside of RoCo is comfy/casual, although I do think their booths are in dire need of an upgrade/reupholster. Can't wait for the plaza midwood location to open!"}
{"text":"Was lucky enough to hear about the friends and family soft opening at the new Plaza Midwood location of Roasting Company. I've been a loyal patron and huge fan of the Montford location for years, so I've been anxiously awaiting this location's opening since it's been announced. 

The interior buildout of this space is impressive.  The centerpiece and spotlight is the huge bar that is set up front and center with plenty of space for people to pop in and grab a bite, or hang out for a few casual drinks. Seriously one of the most impressive bar spaces in Plaza. There is a room directly in the front of the restaurant that has roll up garage doors and will be a perfect place to eat lunch on a warm Charlotte day. 

The food tasted 100% consistent to the deliciousness we all know and love. The kitchen was absolutely on top of it, and our food came out quick and hot. 

I can't begin to express how excited I am for this location's opening, and will be here more often than I'm willing to admit on a public forum."}
{"text":"This truly is a Charlotte classic!  It has been around for many years (and how many restaurants in Charlotte could you apply that test to?) and the food is consistently excellent.  I usually get the veggie platter which has to be one of the best-priced options in the entire city.  And if you want to have a relaxing bar experience, go there at night time.  The laid back ambiance is awesome!  It is by far the best restaurant on Montford Drive."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this place!  It's got a pretty diverse menu so everyone will be able to find something they like (if they like chicken that is).  

I love that it is NO NONSENSE.  You order your food, they call your name, you pick it up.  The end.  The people who take your order have it down to a science - they are fast yet friendly.  The only exception to the rule is the really tall guy with long hair.  He is the rudest person I've ever met, but he seems to be part of the establishment (although I haven't seen him in a while).  

The food:
I love their corn bread.  It is amazing.  It's sweet and moist and flavorful.  

I usually get the chicken and rice con queso.  Then I add the Tico sauce that's on the table.  I don't know what this stuff is, but it's so good.  It's not hot, but it does have a lot of spice and vinegar.  

My favorite sides are the squash casserole and the pineapple casserole (but this is only served occasionally).  The daily sides are listed up on a board above the counter.  

Also if you go on Wednesday, it's CHICKEN POT PIE day.  They have an excellent chicken pot pie.  It's huge and could feed at least 2 people (if you're willing to share).  

Overall: 
If you love chicken, you'll love this place.  They have a great selection.  They even have wings which I've heard were great."}
{"text":"The Roasting Company has been added to my official lunch list.  Walk in, grab a menu, walk up to the counter (or bar), order your food and grab a seat.  Your name will be called a few minutes later and you can go pick up your delicious chicken.  

I need to go back so that I can try all of the other delicious foods."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, amazing pot pie (on Wednesdays) and sides, plus plenty of seating and a cool patio area for when it's warm out. Pro tip: sit at the bar and ya get full service. Also the hot honey (I think?) sauce is amazing."}
{"text":"I'm an in-and-outter here (usually food to go).  However, I've sat at the bar a few times and the service, along with the food, could not be better for what they're trying to do.  I love rotisserie chicken and their's has always been juicy, hot, and fresh.  And the Tico sauce makes it even better, too!  Let's just say I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Roasting Co. is pretty good and a very casual setup. It's along the lines of Boston Market; Roasting Co is a step above BM. I will be going there again to try other dishes on the menu. The garlicky potatoes were good. Reasonably priced food and very similar to Boston Market but more like a bar. They are open until 2am so if you are ever bar hopping on Montford it's worth a stop in."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place for a quick lunch.  Plus, you can find many healthy options that taste great!  One of those rare places that I can leave satisfied and still feel good about myself for eating somewhat healthy.  Don't worry though, you can find your fair share of unhealthy things too!!"}
{"text":"The Roasting Co. is my idea of what perfection is in a restaurant...why???

- Consistent, Supremely Delicious Food
- Great Prices
- Unpretentious, Laid Back Atmosphere
- Great Central Location for Most of the Town
- Fast, Friendly Service

When I lived in Charlotte, this place was a staple for me.  I've never had a bad...anything here.  

The rotisserie chicken goes w/o saying, it's excellent and a natural first choice for the less adventurous.  The Jaco (say, HA-ko) pork anything is the tastiest, most tender pig you'll find this side of Eastern NC 'cue.  You can't go wrong w/the Tacos, Sandwiches, and the Black Bean con Queso Combos (Pork or Chicken).  

Cooking meat well is relatively easy to do...to make one crave vegetables...is not.  You can go here just for the vegetable options alone and be more than satisfied.  I've almost consumed the entire spectrum here except the coleslaw and it's all good.  The 'tops' are the Basil Green Beans, Herbed Rice, and Mashed Sweet Potatoes.  The Cinnamon Apples can be savored as a desert in itself!  The Stir Fry veggies would be the only mediocre item on the menu I've had, but even they're still tasty.  

Bottom Line...Go...now..."}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time last night. Sat at the bar (which is fully stocked, several beers on tap, even had wine on tap). Thursday they have 1/2 priced bottles. So we did the right thing and got a bottle. 

Atmosphere- reminds me of a bar, ya know cause it is one. TV's, wood, ppl laughing and drinking. Very clean, very casual, very perfect for a low key laid back evening. THey have indoor tables, the bar I mentioned earlier and outdoor/indoor seating.

Food - so RoCo is everything I thought Coaltranes was gonna be. The name Coaltrane makes me think of Jazz (John Coltrane, American saxophonist) but it's really like Viva Chicken but Mediterranean. This place is like a low key soul-food spot except all the chicken is roasted (hence the name). The FOOD IS DELish!! So I got a 1/4 (chicken) plate comes with 2 sides I got the squash casserole and the collards. It also comes with cornbread wait for it... with real corn in it! My friend got the rice plate which is essentially the same thing but with an extra side of rice (she works out so - carb it up). The food came quickly and it was hot. I was impressed with the seasoning on the collards - really good. I'm from SC and know how these should be made and they did not disappoint.

Price- this place is very affordable-our total bill including a nice tip (and the aforementioned bottle of wine) was like $45 bucks.

How to order - If you aren't sitting at the bar, walk to the back and go to the counter under the sign where is reads RoCo in big letters, like at Panera Bread, order your food and seat yourself and your food will be brought to you. 
If you are at the bar it's full service (food and drink orders). Not sure how the indoor/outdoor space works. I'll sit there next time. 

Would for sure come back ya know cause I like chicken and it was good!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I haven't reviewed this place before now!! Seriously I eat here like twice a month haha. Can we say rotisserie chicken heaven!! Everything I've had here is great but honestly my favoritist thing is the squash casserole!! Seriously if you get a veggie plate you will feel like you've been transported to a southern Sunday church social!! I feel like they have the little old southern ladies cooking in the back!! Anyways their chicken is good, occasionally dry but I don't mind my chicken that way really. Their chicken pot pies are good and absolutely huge for the money. However the crust is a crisco crust I believe and that's not my favorite. I also recently tried the Jaco pork and it was amazing. My favorite things though are the veggies (haven't I said that already lol). If I get the quarter chicken or the veggie plate I kind of feel like it's Thanksgiving because there is squash casserole, sweet potato mash, green beans, mac and cheese if it's Saturday etc. If you order it through foodie call it's the one and only restaurant that your food will arrive 100% still piping hot!! 

If I'm craving comfort food and I don't want to cook this is my go to restaurant!"}
{"text":"Full plate and tasty! The people I went with said it's jamacian...I'm not familiar. It seems a bit of a combo of TexMex with the different salsas. The chicken is flavorful and there are varieties of sauces to add to your entree. Lots of great side dishes to select (e.g., collards, potato salad, beans) Anyway, it was a quick stop for a fast lunch. 

The atmosphere is open and spacious. It's pretty chilly inside, so wear layers."}
{"text":"The roasting company is a great spot on Montford.  You go up to the food counter and place your order and pretty quickly they are calling your name to pick up your food. The rotisserie chicken is on point and the sides that you get with it are awesome.  I am usually not a fan of vegetables but you must try the white bean au gratin and the squash casserole."}
{"text":"My first 5-star rating... I left this place saying to myself \"This is where I will take people when they want good food.\" 

That's got to be the highest honor in the restaurant business, right? 

Ordering food is quick and easy - walk up to the counter, menus are there but just ask the staff what they like the best. Always will give you something new to try. Always comes out good.

I get the Chicken Queso on Rice. Unbelievably good! Shredded chicken over rice covered in queso. The Mac & Cheese is spicy and different - the baked beans also have a kick. The cornbread actually has corn in the bread and sweet tea rounds off the southern experience.

If you drive too quickly down Montford you'll miss this gem... So slow down and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Never been disappointed by the food at the roasting company. I would say they use high quality ingredients and it's always super tasty. Prices are reasonable for the quality! We go whenever we're in the SouthPark area."}
{"text":"Got a chance to grab to-go lunch today while on a random day off. I tried calling an order into Three Amigos but they didn't answer. Then...I remembered we have a RoCo. Plus, they fixed the entrance to that lot so you don't have to jump a curb to get in there! My car thanks them. 
We walked past the room with the TVs, past the nice full bar and straight to the back corner for the to-go area. No wait which was great because it got busy after we arrived. I got the Monterrey chicken wrap. My husband, the quarter rotisserie with side of the day (Friday) of stewed okra and tomatoes as well as green beans. It came with a corn muffin. Mine was massive and was more like a burrito, I thought. It's too big too hold so had to knife it. Good though. I was not expecting it to be served warm. I got the white beans which were great and I could tell they were cooked from scratch. I'm
Excited about the selection of sides they offer."}
{"text":"Pork over rice was very good but next time I will ask for it without the Jaco sauce and use the Tico sauce they provide on each table. 

Squash cassarole was the bomb just as others mentioned. I could eat a whole pot of the at stuff!! Cornbread muffin was good also with pieces of corn in it...wish the muffin was bigger. 

Wasn't so pleased with the buttery spinach but guess it's a little hard to jazz up spinach...put some Tico sauce on it to make it better. 

All in all very good and I will be back to test other stuff!!"}
{"text":"So good! Why have I never eaten here before? mashed sweet potatoes and squash casserole, both delicious! chicken with black beans con queso, its like the dish was meant for me! My friend got a chicken sandwich which she loved as well. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One star deduction for super strange layout. This place has a full bar that takes up most of the place but they also have a window you can go order at. Just feels a bit confusing to be sit down and order OR come to a window and order. 

One star deduction for bland food! I got the chicken, beans and rice dish that has the speciality bbq sauce over it and it was just plain awful. I couldn't even eat it. I did like my side of pasta salad and that was the only thing I ate. The menu is a bit strange, almost has a Mexican feel to it with queso on many dishes also has a Southern feel with the veggies and plain chicken. I think they need to get a bit more focused on the menu and the concept. 

One star deduction for the sauce bar being a mess and most of the salsa being empty. The staff member was even over there didn't refill them or anything. 

I won't be going back here unless it is for drinks because it has potential to be a pretty cool local neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"This is what I imagine prison food to taste like. We ordered two different chicken plates with various sides. Everything we ordered was watery and tasted like mystery mush. Even the stir fry veggies were bad-- how do you mess that up?

On the plus side, everything was timely and service was very nice."}
{"text":"First time there.  Got the Jaco salad which was awful.  Soaking in a pool of water, it had NO flavor whatsoever.  Tried topping it with salsa from the bar.  That was tasteless too!  Yikes.  Not worth a return visit for that, but I will try the chicken sometime since everyone here says it's so good."}
{"text":"I sometimes eat at the roasting company after work or grab something for the family. It is quality chicken and the squash casserole is amazing. I really like the feel of the place after they remodeled it last year. Definitely a great place if you like a rustic look and feel with good food / drinks and don't feel like getting fancy."}
{"text":"The food is good. Service was terrible. We put in a huge order for our company. They did not have it ready and then the guy was extremely rude to us even though we put the order in an hour before it was to be picked up. When people are spending a lot of money at your restaurant you should not call the business and be rude about it when you mess up. Good restaurant. Obviously can't handle big orders.... We will be ordering catering from other places next time. Sad I had to change my 5 star review due to the way I and others here were treated."}
{"text":"Can I do 3.5? Not quite worthy of 4 stars, but close. Very unimpressive when you walk in, but you can't always judge the quality of the food by the décor. I ordered the Jaco Pork salad, with the jalapeno ranch dressing. I scooped on some of the super spicy Pico de Gallo from the salsa bar too. It was very good, the pork was moist and flavorful. I was pleasantly surprised by how much pork there was in relation to the serving of lettuce. I wasn't impressed with the dressing at all, but the salad was still very good. 

My Daughter ordered the cheese quesadilla, with a side of garlicky new potatoes. She loved both, she even finished everything!

My Wife ordered the chicken taco platter, which was also very well received and enjoyed.

I was surprised that they weren't very busy, it was 12:30 on a College Football Saturday. There is no waitress service, you order from a cashier, then they call your name and you go pick up your own meal. Drinks are self serve too."}
{"text":"As Bill O'Reilly would say, \"F it, We'll do it live!\" I'm writing this one while still here waiting on my Baked Apples to cool down.

Restaurant decor is very impressive (although the booths need to be reupholstered) and probably the most standout storefront on Montford. Walk in and the bar is the centerpiece, with a highlight on local brews. Smoke is in the air from the roasters as soon as you walk in and that's a good sign!

First time here so I tried the Thursday special: Chicken & Dumplings, along with Smoked Cheese & Pasta Salad, and Baked Cinnamon Apples.

Took a seat and my food was quick to arrive. Chicken & Dumplings were good. Nice flavor on the thickened broth but it was overpowered by a mountain of coarse black pepper. I don't say that lightly because I tend to go heavy on black pepper myself, but this was very overseasoned. I couldn't pick out the more subtle flavors in the dish due to the pepper. Dumplings were nice and fluffy, I'm used to a bit more al dente for dumplings but these were fine all the same.

Smoked cheese & pasta salad, best thing I had. The pasta was perfect, dressing was light and bright, seasoned with dill and cucumber. I could eat this everyday. The only thing I didn't pick up much of was smoked cheese, or much of any cheese, but I would take it the same way again and again.

Baked apples... Would have been better as applesauce. The apples were dissolving by just trying to pick them up with my spoon. Unfortunately cooking them to this point, this dish has also lost a lot of its subtle notes like the dumplings. I just got tart and over sweet. Bit of a disappointment.

Regardless of the apples, with good chicken and great pasta salad I'm looking forward to my next visit. I'll probably try the Cornbread dressing as the little round of Cornbread I got was killer! Lots of potential I see here, I just gotta find the right things on the menu."}
{"text":"The restaurant is really confusing. The layout is very strange as you order and wait to get your good and then move to the other side to eat. The staff is a bit rude and impersonal. I'm not sure if I'm impressed."}
{"text":"I went their recently and was very  disappointed.  I ordered the 1/2 portion dark chicken it had little  flavor. The card greens were bland , forgot the tico sauce which was much needed. Baked beans were dry .I could understand if they were busy ,but they had few customers at the time.  This used to be one of my favorites places to eat . The cornbread was excellent.  Will try them again at a later date."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with friends and loved it! We had been hearing that they had really good vegetables. I will be the first to admit I was skeptical since they are a southern place but was excited to give it a try. I had the vegetable plate, for my sides I had the smoked cheese pasta salad with collard greens. I could have licked the plate it was delicious! Can't wait to go back and try some of the other vegetable items on the menu!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has Cuban Chicken. I had their chicken wrap last night with sweet potato fries and it was quite good."}
{"text":"Great great great. The chicken is pretty good but these sides are killer! The smoked cheese pasta, the squash casserole, white beans au gratin, cornbread dressing... The cornbread is steamy & moist and bad yummy little nuggets or sweet corn throughout. This place is a Charlotte gem."}
{"text":"I had the chili tacos, while they were good they didn't really offer a variety of toppings sour cream etc. the restaurant was clean, didn't like that they didn't have servers, but I understand it. Overall I was extremely satisfied with my lunch and so we're my coworkers. I couldn't tell which was the men's and which was the women's restroom, the M and W were hard to see. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Have been here three times in two weeks--delicious! Just wish their lunch specials were offered other days as well (even if it's not at a \"special\" price). Like their buffalo chicken sandwich a lot! Wings are tasty, renovation looks nice, more room to sit."}
{"text":"Great southern cooking with a hint of spice. My soon devoured the drumsticks in one bite. Chill atmosphere with no frills but lots of flavor."}
{"text":"Used to eat there a lot 18 or more years ago, the food is still as awesome as it was back then, there is nothing I can say to describe how exceptionally awesome their food is all I can say is drop whatever your doing, cancel any plans you had and jump in an Uber and get over there right now, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden GEM in Plaza Midwood.  Nestled between the ABC Store and Bistro La Bon in an old strip mall, it would be easy to overlook this delightful restaurant.  

The menu is similiar to other local chicken restaurants - rotisserie chicken, salads, sides, salsas, etc.  The food is very tasty and I really enjoy the rotisserie chicken salad.  

But, what makes this place standout is the atmosphere.  There's a large bar in the center with beer and drink specials EVERYDAY.  There's a great indoor/outdoor patio area.  The service staff is super friendly and it's just a place that invites  you to kick back and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere & service. Food was not bad, but not the best. Missing flavor profiles majorly! We had the nachos, chicken sandwich & rotisserie plate but the chicken just had no seasoning. The dill potato salad needed salt, and the veggies kinda tasted canned, in my opinion. Cake for dessert actually had flavor but was terribly dry. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"It was ok. I had the chicken and dumplings Thursday special. Good flavor, but the dumplings were runny and ruined the entire experience. Would I try it again? Probably not, but I can see some potential. So if you're in the area why not give it a try, you'll probably have a better experience."}
{"text":"Outstanding lunch. Multiple options, quick, and a killer salsa bar. 

The nightlife is great as well. They have the best local draught beer bar in Charlotte. 

This is probably my favorite place in Charlotte. If you're not a regular, become one."}
{"text":"This place has great food.  I love the chicken and black beans, but anything with their jaco sauce is great.  Their food has a little bit of a southwestern feel- they offer bbq, tacos, and have fabulous cornbread.  The only negative I have about this place is that most things come with side items, but the side items vary daily.  This is a great place for takeout."}
{"text":"I've had the authentic Costa Rican rice, beans, and chicken in Jaco Beach.  The roasting company's version is tastier! Their basic plates of rice, beans, chicken or pork, and two sides is a really great deal for the price.  I ate here a year ago and don't remember being impressed, but decided to try it again and this time it really hit the spot.  The black beans and white bean au gratin were perfectly seasoned and yummy.  The green beans were too watery  but still not bad.  The Pork with Jaco sauce was delish.  I will be eating here much more often."}
{"text":"Great place and great atmosphere now with the new renovations. Incredible beer selection as well and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love this place, great portions and great prices. I've never had anything I didn't like. Staff is always friendly and and always seem to be enjoying their job and seem to actually care whether or not they are putting out a quality product."}
{"text":"All in all, this was a borderline 2 star trip for me based solely on my satisfaction with my food. Service was good, i mean the order taker was friendly. Right at the get go, they do have a tip jar. Being my first trip, i gave a small tip feeling like a jackass if i didn't (albeit a small tip). Come to find out, i place my order, then i pick up my own food and fill my own drink, grab my own silverware, and you want a tip for what? Ooooh, i see there is no place to throw away my own trash. i guess that makes me feel better for leaving some tip.   

Anywho, walking in on a Monday to see that the special is a buffalo chicken wrap  felt like a good omen to me. Unfortunately, my wrap left me to continue my search for a favorite buffalo chicken wrap in Charlotte. At first, i thought they just forgot to put any buffalo sauce on it.  Perhaps they thought i ordered the bland chicken wrap instead?
Then it started to have a little flavor, but not much and by the bottom of the wrap, it was a soggy diaper wrap. i tried to add flavor with various salsa and sauces on the table, but couldn't quite satisfy the taste buds. 
The squash casserole was pretty good, but i found myself leaving half of it behind not even wanting to finish it. Same with the sweet potato fries, just kind of bleh.

My favorite part of the trip was when she put my order slip on the thing and threw it down the line to the cook dudes. i'm easily entertained."}
{"text":"Every Time I eat here I get the Exact same Thing and I always think they will not have it anymore or I will not be able to remember what is is called nor how to order!  The Staff here is probably Cousin to Vavid and very helpful!

Pork BBQ Wrap, Minus the Rice, Minus the Cole Slaw, Minus the Cheese and Extra Sauce called well I'm not going to mis-spell that on yelp, nor say it, though it is good!

Collards on the Side please!"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Doubletree next to the South Park Mall with no feeding options other than typical suburban chains....a wasteland as far as I was concerned. I decided to wander through the neighborhoods looking for something a little more local and a little less factoryized.

I found it here.

The best I can say is The Roasting Company exceeded all my expectations. I like that they specialize in one thing (chicken) and they do it well. My 1/4 dark was moist and flavorful and the two sides were well worth trying.

I always try to sample New To Me dishes so I tried the Squash Casserole and Smoked Cheese Salad. I was happy with both. The casserole was helped out by the slight addition of hot sauce (Lisorno?) and the salad was just fine the way it was.

For southern-style grub this is a good as I've had and would definitely come back again.

Oh, by the way, my entire lunch including drink was under $10. A very good value."}
{"text":"Loved everything but the food. I really enjoyed the space, the bar, the look, the option to order at a counter and have the food brought to you. But the food itself was good but not great. Actually, the chicken was excellent but the sides seemed like they were doctored up canned goods. I would go back meet friends for drinks and an appetizer. But not for a meal."}
{"text":"Finally made it here for lunch after hearing good things and living near by for years. I was especially excited to try the Costa Rican inspired food after visiting the country earlier this year and completely falling in love with the food and culture. Unfortunately I didn't care for the food at all. I wouldn't say it was necessarily bad but just didn't suit my taste. I had the chicken and black bean plate with sautéed vegetables. I found everything overly salty and didn't like the sauce at all. I'm not a picky eater and like most foods (except turnip greens, I just can't sorry) but I didn't enjoy this meal. My husband ordered a wrap with chicken, black beans and queso that he said was just \"okay.\" It was chicken pot pie day when we were that and that did look good and like a popular choice. We probably won't be back but it's a place everyone might need to try for themselves. Fortunately the prices are reasonable enough to do just that."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte, a must-try.

My personal is the chicken con queso which is just rice, chicken, and queso and sometimes I get black beans and sometimes not just depends on the mood.

My two favorite sides are the squash casserole and baked cinnamon apples I've been wanting to try the mac and cheese that's a special on Saturday but I did not get there early enough. Very, very good cornbread.

All of my friends love this place, they have really good wings as well as the chicken wrap are among some crowd favorites but you really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday while visiting Charlotte.  Took an Uber from my hotel to grab a late dinner. 

The smoked pasta salad and squash casserole were good. The rest of the food was way too bland. I dumped a quarter of a bottle of Tico sauce on it to try to pep it up.  It didn't work :/  

I got the Jaco sauce on the side. My husband liked it, I didn't. Probably because I don't like bbq sauce, soy sauce or teriyaki and I believe it's some sort of combo of those.

Overall,  I'd skip this place next time I'm in town but some other Yelpers had better luck.

Tip: Go in under the \"Roasting Co\" sign and go to your right to order."}
{"text":"I will preface the next few reviews by saying that North Carolina has some of the best food I've ever had. I've been to the state four times over the past six years, and every time I come, I am blown away by the food.

Roasting Company is yet another place that serves great food for great prices. The chicken is tender, the sides are delicious, the atmosphere is cool, and the prices are very good. I got the soft tacos, spicy mac 'n cheese, and chili. The tacos are made with the rotisserie chicken, though they didn't use the most tender and juicy meat that I love. However, the lettuce and cheese were very fresh, as was the tortilla, and the sauce selection is pretty good. The spicy mac 'n cheese was a special vegetable of the day (I love any state that calls mac 'n cheese a vegetable) so it might not be available every day, but it was damn good; creamy, tasty mac 'n cheese with a real kick. The chili was fantastic; homemade from an old recipe, just the right amount of everything, and a good helping of shredded cheddar and sour cream on top. All that for about $8. If you're ever in Charlotte, definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"\"Enough liquid smoke to kill a small horse.\"
I would recommend Viva Chicken...it's WAY better.

I have eaten here twice now and it just isn't very good. In fact, I would say the food kind of sucks. Here's why:

My first visit I had the chicken, beans, rice, and queso dish. It was pretty bland, not much flavor other than the basic ingredients--it felt like I was eating a bowl of cheesy beans, aka a side dish, not a meal. 

The second time I had the rotisserie chicken sandwich. Luckily I got the joco sauce on the side as it was inedible. Like, enough liquid smoke to kill a small horse. The potato salad was bland as well--not enough dill and the potatoes were cut too big.  

Both visits I found a tiny bone in my food. They warn about it on the menu. I don't see why it's so hard to not pull the bones off a baked chicken. 

The service was not quite up to par. Took a while to refill my drink and I had to ask for it."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices. Everything tastes fresh. The pasta with smoked cheese (pasta salad) is amazing. The service is quick and friendly. They have a decent selection of beers on the shelf, including my fiance's favorite, Imperial from Costa Rica. 

Their home made hot sauce is amazing, you can put it on pretty much anything. Not too hot, not too mild, just full of flavor and it has a chunky-like consistency."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Never disappoints. Food is served fast, hot and fresh. I have never had a bad experience at The Roasting Co."}
{"text":"Went to watch the game there and oh my it was amazing! The squash bake is to die for!"}
{"text":"Pretty rude service...  in an empty store, with no other customers, waited a few minutes while the cashiers cashed out their drawers... after a few more minutes passed asked if I could just tell the cook my order while I waited to pay... cashier then mumbled to her colleague \"can't even wait 5 minutes to order.\"  Having worked service industry, this was just inappropriate.  Wished everyone a nice day and departed."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner since my friend stated that it was good and our food would be ready quickly. 

I ordered the chicken on rice con queso with a side of collard greens and garlicky (their term) potatoes. 

I was startled when a man screamed out my name.. apparently they do that every time someone's food is ready; if you have a heart condition do not stand near the counter..

The collard greens were good and so were the garlicky potatoes; I fear that the chef is afraid of salt though, as my entire dinner was lacking in overall flavor. There was barely any queso in my chicken on rice platter con queso and that is a major problem. Moreover, my entree was barely warm and the rice tasted rather old.

Service at the register was friendly and inviting, but the man at the counter gave me a bad attitude when I asked for a cup.

Overall, I would not come back to this establishment. The food was alright, the cost was too high for what it was, and the service was not the best."}
{"text":"We love Roasting Company!  Been eating here for years.  Would have given them 5 stars except I'm sitting here waiting for a huge to go order I placed yesterday, which they had no record of :-(."}
{"text":"We had gotten recommendations to try out The Roasting Company from a few friends. Maybe it was an off night, but we were pretty disappointed.  

I ordered the rotisserie chicken with black beans & queso. When I got my order almost 40 minutes later (it was busy, but not THAT busy), there was no queso. I went back up to get it which was fine. Even with the queso, which I eventually dumped the whole thing into, my meal was pretty bland. The sides were nothing to write home about either. The \"buttered\" spinach was awful, and the garlic potatoes were decent. Maybe we will give it another shot down the road..."}
{"text":"Food:I visited The Roasting Company for lunch.I ordered the bbq meatloaf with a side of collard greens accompanied by cornbread. The meatloaf was seasoned well and tasted great.It was a huge portion too.I was told the collards were popular but I didn't favor them that much.Not sure if I had a bad batch but it didn't meet my expectations.The cornbread was tasty as it had corn pieces in it and a little sweet.

Service:The gentleman at the counter was very friendly and welcoming.I definitely felt appreciated as a customer.

Time for food:It took 4 mins maximum after placing my order to receive my food.That is awesome!

Setting:The restaurant is spacious and has an ample amount of seating."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place, but never made it past the rude service to even order.  
Went in at 11:30am (they open at 11:00am) and there were 2 cashiers and another person at the register counting out the money in each register...fine, no problem. We waited patiently & after about 10 minutes, the cook came around to the front, so we asked if we could go ahead & put in our order (so that he could start) and we would pay as soon as they were finished counting out the till. The girl standing there huffs at us, rolls her eyes as she picks up a pen to take our order and mumbles \"can't you even wait 5 minutes?!\".  That was all we needed to hear...we said \"thank you...have a good day\" and walked out. 
I would understand if it was before their opening time or a few minutes after...or if they simply said \"do you mind waiting another few minutes\"...but to give that sort of attitude?! No thank you!  There are plenty more options in Plaza Midwood with much friendlier service."}
{"text":"I thought this place was excellent quality for the price.  The chicken was delicious and I loved the amazing selection of side items.  The sweet mashed potatoes were great as well as the roasted veggies.  Overall I will be back a lot more now that I know it's here.  Plus it's totally Paleo"}
{"text":"Top notch place that falls just short of its predecessor, albeit being a brand new addition to Plaza Midwood.  Obviously this is not a negative review by any means as I am a huge fan of RoCo as they absolutely deliver quality chicken and sides at a great price, but I am hoping they work out some of the kinks at the new location.  For example, the sweet potato mash and corn bread are magnificent at the Montfort Location but they are severely lacking here for whatever reasons.  The chicken was great though and I really like the layout of the new location because it's massive, has a great bar, and even has a convertible patio for when it happens to be nice outside. Hoping to be back soon to see the improvements in some of the side dishes that I love from the original RoCo."}
{"text":"You have to try the squash casserole! Some of the best eatin' Charlotte has to offer!"}
{"text":"The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is because Henry the bar tender. The food is amazing. I've been here 100 times and never had one bad thing to say about it. But tonight the bar tender Henry was just straight up rude. He threw the menus at is when we sat down. Neglected us as we dined. And even tossed our bills at us when we were closing out. We would have drank more had we not been neglected. Needless to say. Next time I go back. I'll make sure he's not working. Or else o will. It attend. He did have a great taste of music. But a terrible personality. And ruined my experience/night. Thanks a lot Henry. See you never. Hopefully."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch. We got a seat at the bar (full service here). I just had a water and I ordered a sides platter - rice, stir fry vegetables, salad and it came with corn bread.
Everything tasted pretty good, and fresh. The only problem I had was with the dressing. I ordered Italian but it just tasted liked oil. 
The service is alright. The gentleman taking our order was new (he told us) so he did not know the answers to a couple of our questions.
This is still a pretty new spot and I'm sure I'll be back in a couple weeks to try it out again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chicken place in Charlotte. They have so many options. It is like a chic southern twist! I love the chicken and cheese and my boyfriend had just the chicken and rice and it was amazing too. The dill potato salad and greens are to die for!!! I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This place was a lifesaver! We were stuck overnight in Charlotte due to a missed connection (not our fault!) and needed food really late! The Roasting Company came to our rescue with a closing time of 2 am and with very delicious food! Delicious roasted chicken and great sides. I would not go far as to say that the sides are vegetables (or at least healthy ones) but they were so so so good! Yum! It took quite a bit of restraint not to order another quarter rotisserie chicken and I totally would have if I hadn't eaten all of the sweet potato and cinnamon apple sides!! It's so good!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect from this place since I don't eat meat but this place exceeded my vegetarian taste buds! I ordered the vegetarian combo minus the cheese! It was absolutely delicious instead if the corn bread I got the tortillas! It also comes with two sides I got the stir fry veggies with the collard greens and turned my lunch into a southwest combo! The only thing that through me off at this place is I didn't know if I should sit and order good or order at the register. When you go here order at the register! This is a chilled laid back place to grab a good bite when your on a budget!"}
{"text":"(go with 2.5 stars) 

RoCo is officially a no-go for me.

It's located in the shopping strip off Central Ave that contains Bistro la bon. They boast an open, covered front patio and a spacious interior that includes a wraparound bar.

When you walk in, you are given the option to order at the back cashier or at the bar. Once you order, you can take your seat anywhere, however, make sure you stay pretty close so you can hear your name being called once your order is ready. If you order at the bar, the bartender will typically bring your food to you.

On a recent Tuesday evening, I popped in before a meeting excited to try their Tuesday special: the buffalo chicken sandwich. The chicken was fried hard and dry. Cue my immediate disappointment. The bread is/was not sturdy enough to sustain the large chicken patty. They should consider potato buns instead. I ended up taking the chicken off the bread and just dipping it in sauce I asked for on the side. I decided to try the garlicky new potatoes as my side and I'm so sorry that I did. They tasted as if they'd been sitting out all day and were served in a soupy like consistency of garlic sauce. Not appealing to the eyes nor stomach.

During my first visit, I tried their roast chicken and I have found that to be their one bright spot. However, I find that there are other places that serve much better roast chicken so it's not quite good enough for me to specifically make a stop here for it. What gets me is that their sides taste no better than what you would find at a cafeteria. I've had the stir fry veggies, mashed sweet potatoes, and now the garlicky new potatoes. Every single one has been a disappointment.

When I had the stir fry veggies, the medley consisted of mostly onion. FAIL. The mashed sweet potatoes were okay but they didn't taste fresh or made in-house.

For my first visit, I ate at the bar and the bartender was very nice. My second visit, I ate on the patio since the weather was nice. After you're done eating, no need to worry about clearing the table.There are signs letting you know that someone will come to bus the tables. 

Roco, I really wanted to like you more because I have had better at the Montford location."}
{"text":"Our family gathered here for dinner last night.  It was quickly served and delicious food.  The chicken was great and the pulled boston pork my husband tried was tasty!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to The Roasting Company (or RoCo as all their signage inside said) in about 12 years, so I was excited to see all the changes after they revamped and added a bar. The fella and I stopped in for dinner on a Wednesday night, and we were a little confused when we first walked in. Yes, there's a big ol' sign right above your head that tells you to order at the counter, but still.

We ventured over to the counter and searched for a menu. The sides and veggies of the day were written on chalkboards, but no menu to be found except for the paper to-go ones. There were two cashiers, and I had to wait for them to finish talking to each other before one finally took my order. 

I got the 1/4 rotisserie white meat chicken with rice and black beans, and the fella got chicken with jaco sauce and rice. There was SO much meat on my chicken!! And it was moist and delicious. My rice and beans were pretty tasty, too. I tried the fella's chicken since I had never had jaco sauce, and it was like a sweet, smoky barbecue sauce. 

He wanted a drink, so we had to pay for our meal at the food counter, then head over to the bar to buy the drink, which was a little annoying. I think you can eat and drink at the bar to put everything on one check, but there were no seats there when we went. By the time we leave around 7 p.m., the place was hoppin'! 

Overall, pretty delicious food, especially on a cold, winter night, but the service was a little iffy for me, so A-OK it is."}
{"text":"The Roasting Company has become a go-to lunch spot for me.  Their rotisserie chicken is at the center of the menu: they do sell other proteins, but you need to try the chicken on your first visit.  Pretty much any form of it is a winner, except on top of a green salad.  The chicken itself is fine, of course, but you can find better veggies elsewhere.  If you can't decide and want to start off with something distinctive, get the chicken on rice with jaco sauce.  It's spicy, tangy, and filling.

The sides here are really good as well.  If you feel like indulging yourself, try the pasta with smoked cheese.  This isn't your run-of-the-mill mac and orange-stuff.  If you want to be healthier, the black beans are the way to go.  Oh, and to make everything even better, there's a salsa bar.  

My only caution is that parking can be ... exciting.  It's cramped.  Check over both shoulders before you back out, folks."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place for lunch. The side items are so good it is hard to choose what to get. It can get crowded but it is worth the wait. My favorites are the wonderful pasta salad, their slightly smokey collard greens and the sweet potato fries are the best I have had. Love to dip them in their queso."}
{"text":"Wings are good!  Hot honey is what I like.

Chicken nachos are worth trying.

I've eaten here several times and I have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant as people rave about it, but I've been twice since it opened and I'm still just not that impressed. 

The first time I went with a girl friend we both got roast chicken meals, I ordered potato salad and green beans. The green beans were cold, mushy, and tasteless - they were missing seasoning. 

The chicken wasn't very memorable. 

The second time I went with my husband on their grand opening weekend. They were offering discounted entrees and commemorative cups. We each ordered white chicken meals. I did not make the mistake of getting green beans again, however I was still not impressed. 

They look to have a nice bar set up, I might come back for that."}
{"text":"I stopped here one lunchtime with a couple of coworkers who recommended the place.  After seeing the outside of the building, I was a little dubious --it felt like there should be a 50 gallon drum outside with a roaring fire and a couple homeless folk keeping warm.  Once we got into the building, that thought didn't go away.  The restaurant itself was a bit, hmm, used, maybe --lets just say it looked though it was in need of some updating.  

When you walk in you're presented with a board and a bunch of menu items; right beneath is where you order. --If you've never been before, it might be helpful to checkout their online menu prior to going, otherwise you may be deciding on something in a split second --especially if there is a line behind you.  Soon as you've placed your order, you're shuffled off to the side in true McDonald's style and you wait for your food the be thrown up on a grab-it-yourself servers shelf.

Waiting for the food I had all kinds of interesting thoughts flying through my mind on what it might be made from.  However, that didn't have to last that long --it took ~4 minutes to serve up my hot lunch --a whole minute quicker than the average Chinese joint; that's impressive!

I got the food and I was very pleasantly surprised.  It looked just like a home-cooked meal --not one which had been ordered in a restaurant.  It smelt amazing, looked fantastic, and only took 4 minutes --that's enough to make Stouffers jealous!  Again, to my surprise the food was extremely tasty.  The chicken they use was actually off a full cooked chicken and not from a frozen bag.  There was some salt in the meal  that had been added for taste but not a crap load of MSG flavoring all over the rice to make it taste unnatural --it almost reminded me of when I was a kid and the food was made by mum.

This isn't your typical eat-out kind of restaurant.  If you want a nice home cooked meal without cooking it; this is the place.  It was a nice refreshing change from the typical lunchtime eatery you find.

I will certainly be going here again, I really did enjoyed the food, despite the interesting appearance of the place."}
{"text":"Roasting Company has the best chicken around! They are quick and the food is fantastic! We've lived in Charlotte for 6 years now and tried Roasting company once and have been back monthly ever since! They have done alot of renovations to their store the past year or so and it's great! the store looks much better and there is more room to sit. I highly recommend Roasting Company!!"}
{"text":"On my first visit I had the roasted chicken, which was flavorful and moist.  The chicken pot pies are by far the best I ever had and are consistent every time...they have mastered this dish.  They are so good that I have not tried anything else on the menu since the Wednesday following my first visit.  The serving is huge and packed with flavor!!!  The crust is delicious and holds up perfectly (never soggy or wet, even when reheated after being refridgerated overnight).  In my book, they are fully deserving of a permanent spot on the menu rather than just on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Nothing complicated, nothing fancy, nothing expensive. Just good food served quick! Although a bit confusing for newbies like ourselves we weren't sure if it was a table service spot or a self serve serve spot. We decided to order from the self service location because they seemed friendlier than the bartending area. 

 I rarely order chicken when I go out to eat but it seemed fitting at this location and I'm glad I did! It was delicious and moist and flavorful! Their sides were also delicious! Garlicky potatoes, baked beans and even the Dill Potato Salad was good. Their pork Tacos were great! Not stingy with the pork they were very juicy and filling. 

 So after you place your order your food will be served up nice and hot and very quickly! Pick any table and enjoy! Their sweet tea is THUMBS UP!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte. There is nothing fancy about it but I get good food every single time. One of my favorite items is the Chicken and Rice con Queso.

But, the thing that I will always order no matter what else they are offering is the Squash Casserole as a side. Good grief it's amazing!

This is great for lunch during the work week or after church. It is usually pretty quick even during busy parts of the day.

I need to try more things on the menu but no one I've talked to has ordered anything there and not declared their need to come back as soon as possible. It is sort of tucked away on Montford so I too often forget about it. But this review helped me decide where I'm going for lunch today!"}
{"text":"They roast chicken....we get to enjoy!  Other than the oddly-placed meatloaf special on Fridays, this place is all about the yard bird; although the meatloaf is pretty killer.  This place has the best chicken pot pie I have ever had....good luck finishing it....."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect with this place as the inside is a little run down and what not. I thought the chicken was awesome. I had a side salad which wasn't worth getting and enjoyed potato salad. I thought the price was very cheap for the amount of food you got. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Vegetarian plate with rice and beans was yummy. If you don't eat meat - there are still options. Plenty of sides if you're okay just doing a sides plate.

Boyfriend got a chicken plate and said the chicken was good and cooked well.

Good portion of food for the price."}
{"text":"So happy to have roasting company in Plaza Midwood since we move to this side of town. Cheap, quick, and open late!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick lunch.The chicken is above average and they have a great variety of sides. I eat here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was in high school. The food itself is the best in Charlotte for a proverbial hole in the wall restaurant. Food taste great, it's reasonably priced, and you get it quickly. If you're newcomer I would recommend either the Monterey chicken wrap or the Jaco pork wrap. The best sides are smoked pasta salad, mashed sweet potatoes, or any of the casseroles.

Would help to have the dining room tables cleared quicker and the tables need to be cleaner."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday with a co-worker for the first time in a while, and realized I had never reviewed it!

I REALLY like this place. Can't say much that hasn't already been said, the reviews speak for themselves. Great rotisserie chicken. I love the jaco pork, especially the tacos. 
Cool little salsa bar.....great prices. Yea, i'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered at 7:25. By 7:50 still hadn't gotten food. Had to cancel. Didn't know they were 20 minutes behind until I had to cancel. No empathy or apology. Terrible service."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what you want for lunch. Casual atmosphere, bombastic food, large portions, good music, drink specials... I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had the chicken salad sandwich and it was good but could have used a little punch of some sort. However, I thought their wings were a touch better.

On the wings, they were a bit light on the sauce and didn't fully understand what I meant by crispy I guess. I ordered them with Hot Buffalo sauce and got the nuclear on the side since several of us were eating them. The nuclear is fairly hot but on my scale not nuclear. Very meaty wings."}
{"text":"I frequent Charlotte quite a bit and was tipped off about The Roasting Company from a picture I saw on \"Charlotte Agenda's\" Instagram. 

There a 2 locations in Charlotte one in Montford the other off Central Ave. we opted for Central Ave. 

The restaurant is a cool trendy spot with outdoor/ indoor seating area as soon as you walk up. And a massive exposed brick wall lining the inside. You walk up to the counter to order and then seat yourself or you can sit at the bar which is full service. 

Now onto the food! The food was amazing and the portion sizes were hefty! The sides were all amazing (I tried 4). The smoked cheese pasta salad was hands-down the best side by far!  This spot I would def recommend to anyone that lives in the Charlotte area or even anyone visiting!"}
{"text":"This visit I had a 1/4 white meat roasted chicken, collard greens, and squash casserole. I believe every dish comes also with a little bit of cornbread. The cornbread was good, not to sweet and had actually little pieces of corn in it for texture I suppose.

The greens were okay, a little bland. The squash casserole was my favorite, but I love squash so..... 

The chicken, for me, lacked a little flavor. I noticed there was a sauce/salsa station in the back where you could add your own  to your chicken. I was not really interested in this idea. I would have rather had the chicken seasoned before or during the roasting process. 

Overall my meal was not bad, I received A LOT of food for under $15. I took the rest to lunch with me the next day.

This location is nice as well, they have a patio area in the front and lots of space inside. Clean restrooms."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend's favorite restaurant in Charlotte hands down.  They have the most amazing rotisserie chicken and their sides are incredible.  I highly recommend the smoked cheese pasta salad, squash casserole, cornbread dressing, or garlicky potatoes.  If you're a vegetarian you can have a great meal by just getting a side plate.  It's always super fast and the atmosphere is nice.  The prices are also great, you can get a huge meal for under $10.  They also have a full service bar where you can order your food if you sit there.  I will also mention they have an incredible chicken pot pie on Wednesdays however to get it you will probably need to get there by noon.  If you go to one restaurant in Charlotte make this your spot!"}
{"text":"I got the three veggie plate and their squash casserole is the best around.  I also got their Cole slaw and stir fry veggies which was good.  Their cornbread is something I always look forward to.  This is the second time I got their veggie plate and it didn't disappoint.  Next time, I will be trying one of their salads which I saw from someone next to me was a really good portion."}
{"text":"The Roasting Company has to be one of my favorite spots to grab some fresh southern food with a bit of a Tex mex twist. Their garlicky new potatoes are mouth watering when paired with their basil green beans. Their location on Montfort Dr is super convenient but be sure to park around back as it's typically pretty full. The best part is they're open late which is perfect whether you're eating in or taking it to go."}
{"text":"Best place yet I have been in Charlotte!!!  Great Beer selection ! ( Wooden Robot)- and me...I give you 10 stars in being able to figure out how the hell to actually cook vegetarian side dishes that are really vegetarian!!  Guess what no one else can figure it out!  Bland Bland bullsht! Your food was awesome and I as a long time vegetarian so appreciated actually trusting that your side dishes were vegetarian!  I had the 4 sides and cornbread.  Squash casserole was dynamite and had beans, corn and greens!  Yum you guys!!! Thanks for being vegetarian respectable! I know my meat eating relatives loved the other food too!"}
{"text":"The Roasting Company is hella dope! I just got four sides of veggies and it really made a complete meal. It tasted like home-cooked food like grandma would make, if my grandma were Southern, that is. I got the squash casserole, the cheesy grits, the collards, and the green beans, and then because of a mixup I got the apples for free, those things are so good. The only thing I didn't really care for were the green beans, they seemed like they were from a can and I'm not a big fan of canned food. The prices were awesome- my plate came with a really good little cornbread muffin and was just over $5. If I lived in the area I would eat here often for sure. It also had a homey ambience. The customer service was great. The people working there are super friendly and sweet. Roasting company hit the spot when I was craving something healthy Southern style food with a lot of vegetables, and I was very glad that the veggies didn't have any meat added to them!"}
{"text":"Wowie Zowie!!

This place is awesome. I've eaten here for lunch and dinner before, and I would do it again. 

The Jaco Pork and rice is awesome. It might be better than the chicken, but they're both great. If you get the. Chicken and rice with queso, put some Tico sauce on there!

The sides that I've had were great. The smoked cheese and pasta (it's a pasta salad) was really tasty, and I usually don't like pasta salad. Cornbread was great too."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to go for generous portions.  they serve roasted chicken (as to be expected for someplace named the roasting company!).  You can get tacos, some sandwiches and a dish called jaco pork (with rice).  There are side dishes, wraps and salads as well.  Prices are reasonable ~$8 for a plate and $6.50 or so for a sandwich.  The food is tasty, prepared to order (mostly) and arrives in minutes.

I have been for lunch and dinner and enjoyed every meal!"}
{"text":"This place was great! The food (roasted half chicken and chicken wrap were our entrées) is amazing. My wrap was larger than q large burrito. The atmosphere was a dive and really cool. Food is served on real plates with real silverware and the food is cooked with special care. The 2 of us are for $22. You will not fi D a better bargain."}
{"text":"Love the fresh roasted chicken for lunch or for dinner. Also the assorted sides are healthy and tasty including collard greens, white beans, squash casserole, and all sorts of good things too many to list here. Wait, I need to list that corn bread with bits of corn in it-- good stuff.

This is a true Charlotte gem. Glad they are in business and doing well."}
{"text":"The Roasting Company is always a safe bet.  Succulent chicken and a variety of sides.  Go to the counter, tell the cashier what you want, and lickety split your order is ready.  Today I had a quarter chicken with dill lima beans and the cinnamon apples.  Those cinnamon apples were something to write home about!  It was served up with a corn bread muffin. Despite the fact they only had dark meat when I ordered, it was still tasty.  I do wonder, however, how a chicken place can run out of white meat. Hmmmm.   It's in a warehouse kind of building and it was jumping with millennials.   I was there representing the baby boomers.   Apparently the other boomers stayed home today."}
{"text":"Great sides, fast service, and great local beer. There daily specials are so good they usually always sellout- so get there early.  salsa bar is always yummy. This Place is never crowded and offers parking which is nice.  They have a great variety of sides, the squash casserole is my
Favorite!"}
{"text":"So happy for the RoCo that they are successful and expanding BUT..... the Montford Dr Store needs a little love, or at least an experienced manager.
My husband and I have been eating at the Roasting Company once a week for years. While we have experienced an \"off night \" every now and again, the quality of the food and the friendliness of the staff and continued to decline over the past 6 months.
While we understand staff turn over, I truly hope the RoCo management will take a hard look at the food coming out of the Montford Dr kitchen. There needs to be some consistency. It's pretty basic stuff that they have done so well for so long.  And a smile goes a long way :)

**Thanks Doug for the comment. I wouldn't have posted this if I wasn't concerned. We have really noticed a difference and are concerned about our favorite restaurant. I hope the quality returns."}
{"text":"First time to this little gem, Great Roasted Chicken and the sides!! Wow ! The sides are amazing, never have I seen so  many great choices...from Squash Casserole to Pasta with Provelone to Seasoned Corn. the Selection goes on and on and also adds different ones during the week. I wanted to try just the Chicken and 2 sides. It was great..not a tiny chicken like you get at some places but a nice sized breast and wing, thigh and leg combo. Very Juicy and warm.  Their Barbecue sauce is delicious..a step away from the norm - I think it must have coffee in it...Wonderful!.  A couple of salsas top off the additions to make your roast chicken more tasty!  I will be coming back...I would even do the 4 sides and cornbread next time..I wanted to taste all the veggie!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic takeout, the best half roasted chicken in town. The queso is popular but I didn't love it. Definitely try the squash casserole."}
{"text":"The service and food here are great!! Sit at the HUGE bar or counter service for everyone else... Jade is the BEST !!!!! Great drink specials ...trivia on mondays ...cheese grits on special on wednesdays !!!! Food is so reasonably priced and I can't wait until the summer because the front open air patio will be jumpin !!!! great vegetarian options too!!! Located in the heart of plaza midwood park eat and enjoy the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place goes to show that a simple concept can lead to great success!  Having bookmarked Roasting Company for some time, my latest stop in Charlotte propelled me to stop in!  A little confusion as to where to go and what to do, without anyone at the front to explain, I figured out to go through the dining area to the back right area to order.

From suggestions from a employee, I ordered the Chicken Black Bean Combo and a 1/2 Chicken with sides of Squash Casserole and Sautéed Veggies!  

The combo is chunks of their rotisserie chicken over black beans and rice, then it's topped with a housemade queso sauce.  It's absolutely phenomenally good!  The squash casserole that I had with it was equally impressive!

The 1/2 chicken white, with a side of stir fry veggies, was again a impressive dish that due to the slow roasting of the chicken!  It literally falls off the bone and the stir fry will impressively surprise you!

My only knocks on the place is the lack of knowledge of what to do and where to go when you first go in.  The other is their way of calling out your order once it's ready.  The lady working the pass will literally scream your name out to the point that if you're sitting near that area, it's annoying as hell!  Your constantly bombarded with someone screaming throughout your meal!  The food is incredible, just bring your earbuds!"}
{"text":"Our family visited this place for the first time yesterday, and I was completely underwhelmed. First the experience, then the food.

You order at the counter, then stand around waiting for your food. This part of my experience was the most infuriating. As I said, we visited with family, so we were hoping to spend some time together. This was impossible because at least one person must stand up front the entire time waiting for everybody's order, while the rest of the group can visit with one another. So there I stood for a solid ten minutes, getting hungrier and more irritated with every passing minute. Finally the food starts to arrive at the pass, and, unless you have 4 hands, be prepared to make several trips back and forth from the table to the counter. I don't understand why they can't supply their customers with trays to simplify this process. Also, when you're paying they request a tip, but they do absolutely nothing to earn a tip! Do you tip the people working at Mcdonalds? RoCo needs to do something more like Viva Chicken where you get a number, find a seat, and an employee brings you the food. However Viva Chicken doesn't even ask for a tip.

Next the food. I ordered a quarter dark with squash casserole and spicy mac and cheese. I'm fairly certain I received the absolute tiniest piece of chicken imaginable. Look at my picture! That's about a bite and a half of chicken! I saw a kids plate with more chicken! The squash casserole was extremely mushy and could have been eaten with a straw, but it tasted good I guess. I did enjoy the macaroni though, so not all was lost. 

I also feel like I should mention I noticed an employee in the kitchen load up a long rotisserie rod with raw chicken, then rest one end on the floor while waiting. I'm sure the oven gets hot enough to kill anything, but still...

Overall, I give the Roasting Company 2 stars for non-existent service and child-size portions."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I finally got over to the Roasting Company one day for lunch.  I had heard about it for years and my mom was always getting it for me when I was sick but I had never actually been inside.  She said the way they seasoned their chicken was perfect for getting over the common cold.  Well she was right, it always did the trick.  So I was thrilled when on a rather healthy-feeling day I went in for a delicious meal of fresh veggies and homemade cake!  The chicken, as always, hit the spot.  There was a cool, funky vibe in there thanks to the young and welcoming staff.  And it was nice to just order at the counter and then kick back in the casual environment and catch up with old friends."}
{"text":"The chicken is good and the sides are always delicious. There's a bar that tends to serve a good variety of beers and stays open late."}
{"text":"A solid 5/5. Phenomenal food in a laid back atmosphere, order at the counter and pick up food when your name is called. The rotisserie chicken is among the best I've ever had and the homemade veggie sides are all great, especially the cinnamon apples and squash casserole. It's hard to go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Just good chicken! Counter ordering eliminates the waitstaff and makes this a quick dining option. The greens were very vinegary but I kind of liked them. Great choice for lunch."}
{"text":"The rotisserie chicken was really good. I got the stir-fry veggies and squash casserole for sides and they were tasty as well, although I was expecting something more home made feeling with the casserole. The corn bread was okay, I prefer the square to the muffin types. The soda (Cherry Coke) machine tasted like it needed a calibration, too syrupy. I would certainly return."}
{"text":"Great place and super cheap.  I usually get a side item plate...they have so many great ones to choose from (squash casserole, smoked cheese and pasta, basil green beans, mashed sweet potatoes...)  You can also get rotisserie chicken...just be sure to use the Tico sauce on the table.  Great!!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a place back in NY..!!  Their rotisserie chicken is PHENOMENAL! Always fresh, always hot!

I came her on a lazy Friday night after work...it was one of those nights where I didn't really want to go out to dinner, but I didn't really want to stay home...when I first walked in it took me a sec to figure out their set up, and how it works, so I just followed the crowd... (Btw, Don't let the exterior look of this place scare you away-it can look a bit \"outdated/older\")

Once inside, You walk up to a counter, place your order/pay and then wait off to side until they call your name. You can place your order to go, or you can look for a an open table.

I saw that there was two open seats at the bar so I told the young lady that I would be by the bar. I was waiting to here my name be called...but she brought the food on over to me, which was extremely nice of her since she didn't have to do that. 

One of the reasons I decided to actually stay and eat there was that all there draft beer is $3.50 on Fridays. You CANT beat that. They have an AWESOME selection of beers...I just had to stay lol...

We ordered:
Chicken and black bean combo con queso - rice topped with chicken,
black beans and queso. It was delicious! The chicken was pulled right off of the bird, it was hot, tender. juicy....really really good.

1/2 rotisserie chicken dinner with sidesd. Again, the chicken was just PERFECT!

For sides we had white beans au gratin 3/5, squash casserole 5/5, smoked cheese and past salad 5/5, and the collard collard greens 4/5.

This place just reminds me of home. If you want a homestyle cooked meal, without making it yourself, this is the PERFECT place to come to. 

I will definitely be coming back here again. I really enjoyed the food and had really great service."}
{"text":"It's a simple plate of food that can fill you up at the end of a night of great times and good laughs. It's tasty and if they don't have enough flavor there's plenty of house sauces that can help. I would always return. I normally order chicken con queso. With pasta salad and apples. Do you want hand made food or made by hand, trust me there's a difference."}
{"text":"I love the Roasting Company. They fairly recently upgraded the atmosphere and added a bar but the food remains unchanged. Great comfort food.  The 1/4 Chicken and two veggies is a favorite of mine. The squash casserole and cornbread stuffing are both awesome but you cant go wrong with any of their sides including collards, baked beans and more.  My only complain is that they only serve their mac and cheese on Saturdays."}
{"text":"The Roasting Company was our go-to spot when we lived in the neighborhood. It was quick and always delicious. We would often dine in and even more often grab it to go.

Our favorite dishes are the pork over rice and the 1/4 chicken with 2 sides. The sauces are unique and so good! I always get the squash casserole as a side and alternate between the others. I've never been disappointed but some other favorites are the garlic roast potatoes, the pasta salad, the mac n cheese, the baked beans....you get the idea. 

I love that I can eat healthy here. Just get some roast chicken and a couple of veggie sides. 

We will miss having this place nearby but we'll be back."}
{"text":"I love all the food here. The chicken is juicy, flavorful and tender. Squash casserole is delish though I feel like it has more breading in it than it used to a few years back. Monterey Chicken Wrap is so good. This is where I go when I dont want to feel guilty about not making dinner for the family. Feels like a home cooked meal and you can order a balanced plate :)"}
{"text":"12 years and still going,  we've loved thus place after being introduced by local friends.   Now we bring new friends here too.   It's changed over the years,  adding a bar,  with lots of local beers on tap.   Just a matter of changing with the customer needs.  Food stays great though and the hot sauces are my husbands favorite (aside from the nuclear wings)  nothing is too hot for him.  My daughter and I love the chicken and black bean combo con queso!   The garlicky new potatoes and stir fry are our sides of choice but they have a pretty assortment to choose from."}
{"text":"I loooove this place. I always have a great time. The staff are absolutely great! The food is amazing! My friends and I love coming here for food or just to hang out. Either way.....great!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite rotisserie chicken hangouts! The chicken is great, even without the special sauce!  When you walk in you walk up to the counter to order your food. Believe it or not, by the time you get your drinks, utensils...etc, you are being summoned back to the station to get your food!  No time wasted at all!  With the recent changes to the dining room they now have more seating and a great looking bar to hang out at.  You can't leave there without getting the Chicken and cornbread dressing!"}
{"text":"Just as it says on the back of the menu, this restaurant food is both nutritious and affordable. What a great concept! But I would add one more thing and say \"nutritious\", \"affordable\" and \"yummo!\" 

I had CHICKEN & BLACK BEAN COMBO W/1 VEGGIE & CORNBREAD and I chose from so many selections \"Basil Green Beans\" as 1 veggie. I also had a Coke. All under $10. 

This is a great place for a quick but tasty lunch.
I loved the Costa Rican green chili sauce too!"}
{"text":"Since I was a little kid, this has been the best chicken I've ever tasted. And the roasted potatoes, chicken tacos and of course the tico sauce are A1..."}
{"text":"Went after church today since it was just my wife and myself eating lunch.  Man, I love this place!  The flavors are great! I love the salsa bar with FRESH pico and salsas.  Sides are equally excellent.  Food is simple, but very good.   We ordered takeout, and had enough for lunch, and then leftovers for dinner!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here for some anniversary food (I recently lost my job, so this was the best I could do).

Got teriyaki bbq wings, 1/2 white with smoked cheese and pasta and basil green beans, and 1/2 dark with smoked cheese and pasta and squash casserole. THE WINGS ARE AMAZING; absolutely delicious. I wish that was all I ordered.

My 1/2 white was dry and didn't taste remotely like rotisserie chicken (rotisserie should be perfectly moist all the way through). The smoked cheese and pasta was more like pasta salad than macaroni and cheese (I guess that green stuff in it was spinach), and the basil green beans tasted straight from the can (NO FLAVOR, not even salt and pepper).
The 1/2 dark was the same (dry) and my girlfriend liked the squash casserole (has corn in it), but DID NOT like the smoked cheese and pasta. The cornbread has chunks of corn in it, and I'm not talking about fresh corn (the kind that tastes candied and gets stuck in your teeth easily).

I will only be ordering wings from now on. I might be tempted to get the girlfriend their spicy cheese grits if we ever order on Wednesday."}
{"text":"A charlotte classic! So much so, i probably take it for granted.  A love that they keep it simple, just great food, prepared quickly! 

Hard to find better quality on a daily basis.  Dish and Roasting Company definitely have the best top to bottom options for sides!  You have to try the \"squash casserole\" at Roasting, it's delicious...even if you aren't a squash fan.

My go to entree is their smothered \"Chicken on Rice con Queso\" 

They also have daily specials that never disappoint.  Also, A bunch of local beers on tap at the bar.  

Roasting pulls off the trifecta....they are good for a quick in and out lunch, grabbing drinks and snacks with friends or a casual sit down dinner."}
{"text":"What can I say other than this place is a solid, cheap option with late night food in the Montford area.

Oh! I know what else: the chicken will blow your face off. I don't know what they do to it and the sauce, but it rocks harder than Axel Rose high on an ounce of cocaine with 5,000 ten-foot-tall speakers and a subwoofer that runs on plutonium. It's basically a mix of teriyaki and barbeque sauce that you can slather on some pulled chicken and put on a sandwich or serve over rice (Central American style).

There's also beer galore. A few unique ones are on the list, like the locally-produced and hilariously-dubbed Babymaker IPA. Don't get me wrong: we're not talking World of Beer here. But, the list is still substantial and the prices are good: about $5 per sling of a glass of malty bread.

Service by a younger-looking server was attentive and knowledgeable. That matters to me and is a big reason I went with a five star review.

Atmosphere is chill, not really comfortable. But, it's a fun place, so who the fuck cares.

Bottom line, check it out. It is tops."}
{"text":"My husband and I love The Roasting Company.  The food is fantastic, fast, and always served with a smile.  We always sit at the bar because of the hospitality Jake and Danielle give.  They deliver consistent great service that we can count on.  The beer selection is great too.  Jake, the bar manager, always gets in great beers like those from Wooden Robot and Wicked Weed, that are just not found everywhere in Charlotte.  In fact, I don't know that you can get Wooden Robot but 2 places outside of the brewery. 

The Roasting Company is perfect comfort food with a casual vibe and we always feel right at home.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"The half chicken with all dark meat is the way to go. The chicken was moist and the cornbread was filling. I went with three sides instead of two and thought it was just the right amount of food for a post workout meal."}
{"text":"You have to go on Tuesday and you have to go early in the afternoon - the special of the day only offered on Tuesday is the quintessential friend buffalo chicken sandwich - arguably the best I've ever had. From the bun to the lightly breaded chicken to what I would say is the definitive buffalo sauce. It's all there. Downside is that hey usually sell out by 2 pm."}
{"text":"While planning my trip I was checking out many of my old favorites, some are gone, many are still flourishing like the Roasting Company. I lived in the neighborhood and would eat here regularly like 2-3 times a week. Imagine my surprise to find they had finally opened the place up and added a full bar and doubled the size of the menu, all to the betterment of their devoted customers.

I was all smiles when I saw that my all time favorite \"smoked cheese pasta salad\" was still featured, I got an extra order to take back to the hotel. The rotisserie chicken is still the star here, crispy on the outside, juicy and luscious in the inside. All the sides are great, there are 18 to choose from, something for everybody. Free refills, that beautiful classic salsa bar, and and endless supply of hot sauce and their special Tico sauce. The service is always fast, the food is consistently great, I never understood why these guys haven't expanded beyond Montford Drive because this business would thrive anywhere. Also a great place to watch a ballgame now since the expansion. Got a really nice vibe now.

BTW, I was amused at some of the negative reviews. Are you people insane? And BTW, occasionally Yelp does listen cause I flagged one review that raved about the food, but gave the restaurant one star because she had to \"refill my own tea\" so if you see any of your favorite places being abused like this please flag away, you never know."}
{"text":"2nd time... Chicken n rice w. Collars greens GREAT, but the the baked cinnamin apples were AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Service industry, please keep reading if you want to know how to earn a 1.85$ tip on24$ bill.

Went in for lunch, sat at bar. The lady was rushing the entire time which was off-putting as the place was not crowded at all. Me and my compadre ordered a chicken meals w a side salad. We do not like tomatoes or cucumbers... apparently this is a vital sin at roasting company in plaza midwood while the woman is bartending. After we ordered our food i went to the restroom to wash my hands, on the way out i heard the waitress/bartender bitching about us bc of the way we ordered our salads to the cooks who looked like they didnt give a shit about the trivial order. She proceeded to demean both of us to them as i stood right behind her listening to every word. I did not walk out as I maybe should have... on to the food... chicken and rice was sooooo watery that it slid around on the plate. It was not good. Maybe the food was good but the awkwardness of eating after hearing shit talked about us was too much to bear. As a former restaurant person of many years i get that people can be a holes etc, we were not that at all i promise... i get that workers deal w sht heads and may talk-smack on customers but just dont get caught and when its over salads w out cux and tomatoes chill the f out bc its not a big deal."}
{"text":"Tonight I had their special: Southern BBQ Wrap, and as my side I ordered the Squash Casserole ($8.99) Both were outstanding, and the Southern BBQ Wrap may be my new favorite! I don't always walk away remembering food, but I'll remember that wrap! You must try it!"}
{"text":"This was pretty great. I had the chicken and queso with beans and rice. Its was perfect comfort food. I would absolutely eat here again. The garlic potatoes were also delicious."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, once years ago and then again this past weekend.  We recently moved closer to this area an am sure we will visit often.  At least whenever we need a veggie fix.  Known for their roasted chicken, we both ordered it with different veggies.  The pasta salad was very unique and tasty.  Collards and mac & cheese did not disappoint.

They have changed the place a good bit since I was last here, adding a bar.  The bar was beautiful and a place I wouldn't mind hanging out with friends.

A lot of people passed us with wings, maybe something we'll try next.  It isn't a huge place but there is a good bit of seating still.  You walk up an order then pickup when they call you.  Makes for a quick lunch or dinner.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Oh Roasting Company, you have been around for as long as I can remember.  Everyone I have ever taken here has always had nothing but good things to say about you.

I always get the con queso or jerk sauce over the roasted chicken and rice and the squash casserole is awesome, need I say more!"}
{"text":"For a quick, delicious, cheap (did I say delicious) chicken lunch or dinner in town, look no further than the Roasting Company. Not much decor to speak of, but when all meals come out in under 5 minutes and cost less than $10, fancy decorations are unnecessary. 

My two favorite meals are the chicken and black bean con queso and the half white meat chicken breast. Both are cooked to perfection, and I can get at least two meals out of one order. The corn bread muffins are also very good (be sure to order additional because you'll want more than one - it's worth it at only $0.35 each), and if you go on Saturday, you can get the mac 'n cheese, which has a kick and is my favorite side item offered. The squash casserole and the sweet potatoes are also quite good. 

Ultimately, I recommend the Roasting Company for a quick meal or takeout on those days where you just don't want to cook or need a quick lunch."}
{"text":"So I've been having the occasional lunch at The Roasting company for over 8 years now.  I called in our order today for my office and was again talking to a young guy that sounding like he'd rather be anywhere than on the phone taking my order.  When I told him I wanted to place an order for pickup, he actually said \"Oh...  ok, let me get a piece of paper...\"  WHAT?  It's 11:15am on a business day and you work at an establishment that makes its money from lunch orders.  Why are you not ready to take an order when you answer the phone?  (And if you're not ready, why do you still have that job??)  Then when I arrive and am simply being mannerly in my conversation, I'm met with silence by the dirty looking guy that's behind the bar.  His hair looks like an oily mess, his pants are hanging off his @ss and he refuses to speak when spoken to?!!??  You do know you're not selling gold bars in this place, right?  I mean- there are tons of other lunch options out there, The Roasting Company isn't all that.  I've SO had it with these entitled millennials half @ss doing their jobs at establishments...  The only thing they're really good at is RUNNING OFF YOUR CUSTOMERS!"}
{"text":"Holy Squash Casserole...heaven! My boyfriend loves this place so we went for lunch here on Saturday and I was very impressed. It is priced right and the food is delicious. I also enjoy any place with cherry coke on tap! 

I went with the Tarragon chicken salad on a kaiser roll with garlicky potatoes as my side. My boyfriend had the Monterrey wrap with casserole. My potatoes were ok and sandwich good but the casserole is where it's at! I wish they had it on their menu (it's a special) because I could eat that as my meal alone! 

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food here needs more seasoning.  Sure the chicken and pork are roasted until it shreds with a fork, but that doesn't compensate for the lack of taste. I'm not a fan of their Jaco sauce which is probably why I'm not a fan.  But their sides are also pretty tasteless too. 

Try it; you might like it...if you're into bland(er) food."}
{"text":"It has been many years since I've been to the Roasting Company down on Park Road, so I luckily remembered that they had this location when we were looking for something different, and glad that we decided to visit.

The new spot is fancy indeed (okay, maybe not white napkin super fancy, but definitely when compared to the old one). It's also nice and open, with a separate bar area, doors that open in nicer weather (though you do have to look over the parking lot), and overall a great space.

Once you do get past that questionable parking lot, the staff is amazing - they will even give you tastes of sides if you are leaning one way or the other, and help you make a decision. Or make your decision a little more difficult, perhaps. The star of the show is, of course, the roasted chicken, so make sure you grab some. One word of warning: If you get a wrap, it can be awfully messy, and due to the aforementioned lack of white napkings, you may not want to go in your Sunday best."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but wasn't exactly what I was expecting. Everything was was good quality and well prepared (and fast!) and the price was very reasonable. My wife and I both ordered the 1/4 rotisserie chicken (white) which came with cornbread and two sides. I got the baked beans and the special: spicy mac & cheese. The first thing I tried was the cornbread, and found it had jalapeños and whole kernels of corn baked in. I know some people really like the whole corn in the cornbread thing, but I'd rather keep my breads and vegetables separate. Next up was the spicy mac & cheese. I love mac & cheese, and I've become a big fan of having a bit of hot sauce added to give it some kick, so I was really excited about this. It certainly had the spicy; it had lots of jalapeños mixed in and was quite hot. What it was lacking was the cheese. There was no creaminess to it at all. The baked beans, however, were very good. They also had jalapeños mixed in (are you sensing a theme here?), but only had a subtle kick which was balanced with a slightly sweet tangy sauce. As for the chicken, the flavor was excellent but most of the breast was pretty dry. The wing, on the other hand, was quite juicy. If you're looking for really moist chicken you might have better luck with the dark meat. There were no jalapeños in the chicken."}
{"text":"The speed in which they deliver your food is always amazing!   Oh yeah, the food is good too."}
{"text":"I was turned on to the roasting company by a colleague and now I'm addicted.  It's truly as good as it gets.  I always get the quarter chicken and it's better than you'll find almost anywhere.  Apples are wonderful too. Everything is served hot the fresh.

There's a reason there's always a line and parking can be hard to find...this place has chicken covered!"}
{"text":"Jaco pork taco and white bean gratin are my favorite! Try the tico sauce too!! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"I was not blown away with the food at the Roasting Company when I went like many people were it seems. I ordered the chicken and black beans con queso, and it was good but nothing memorable. The chicken was pretty moist and had decent flavor, and was very good with the Tico sauce- which I'll admit is excellent! The black beans and rice were pretty bland and the queso was average as well. I also got a side of green beans that was okay and macaroni salad which was very good. Overall, I'd recommend the mac salad and the tico sauce on chicken but not much else stood out."}
{"text":"Awesome rotisserie chicken and sides. My fave is the squash casserole. No matter how many people rave about the jaco sauce and how many times I've tried to like it, I just can't. It's super overpowering and sweet and when it came with my chicken and rice dish, it felt like the whole dish was drenched in it, making it more like a soup.  That aside, everything else I've had has been awesome."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I love every single side item in this place. That's right, I'm the girl who goes to the bangin' chicken place and orders all the sides. 

The Roasting Company is one of those places that just feels comfortable. The food is great and the vibe is laid back. You'll see a line at lunch time. Don't worry, it moves pretty quickly. They crank out some food here. 

I always get a vegetable plate of some sort. The smoked cheese and pasta salad is one of the best sides you'll find in Charlotte. I switch up my other choices based on my current modd. The white beans au gratin, basil green beans, squash- it's all good. I'll stop before I basically just list their entire side item menu. The chicken con queso is delicious. They also have different daily specials. Wednesday is chicken pot pie day. I recommend getting there early because they sometimes run out. 

They have a ton of local beers. The Tico sauce- I don't really know what it is, but it's freaking delicious. I put it on everything. There's also a location in Rock Hill and they're opening one in Plaza Midwood. Happy dance. 

As if you need any other reason to come here, Luke Kuechly ate here the week before every game last season. The only week he missed- the one regular season game we lost against Atlanta."}
{"text":"This is such a fantastic addition to Plaza Midwood. 

I have always been a big Roasting Company fan. I think their Smoked Cheese and Pasta Salad is one of the best side items you will find in Charlotte. This is also a place that has sneaky good queso. I like a lot of things on this menu. Pending on my mood, my go-to orders bounce around between the side item plate (comes with yummy cornbread), chili taco platter, the con queso dishes, and the specials. Bring a friend(s) so you can start with nachos or chips and queso. They have different specials each day (food and drink). Of note: chicken pot pie on Wednesdays (go early they sometimes run out) and chicken and dumplings on Thursdays. Vegetarians, they might be a chicken place, but they have a ton of options for you guys as well. Their Tico Sauce is also delicious. 

I like that there is a patio type area with a TV (it's technically in the building, but they open the doors). They also have a great bar. Note: when you walk in, you can sit at the bar or walk back to the counter and order, then sit wherever you want. This location is open til midnight on Sunday-Tuesday and 2am Wednesday-Saturday."}
{"text":"I was entirely disappointed. I've heard such good things.. i had the buffalo chicken wrap with a side of mac n cheese. The buffalo wrap was fairly bland, very liquid-y and a mess. My husband had the chicken plate with rice and both didn't have a lot of flavor. I would recommend 10 times over the place around the corner.. sorry i will not be returning. Although the atmosphere and ppl working there were pleasant."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I was pleasantly blown away by my recent visit to the Roasting Company! I thought I'd walk in after my yoga class just to check it out, but ended up staying for an outstanding meal considering the quality and the price point.

A three veggie plate + cornbread is only $5. That's right, FIVE DOLLARS. I can't remember the last time I got a meal in Charlotte for $5. My most recent trip to Bojangles cost more than that.

And guys, the food was GOOD. Mashed sweet potatoes were on point, not overly sweet and greasy like some diners in town. They also had a white bean stew on special which had really good flavor and warmed me up on a cold day. The King of the Plate though was definitely the cornbread - I'd just eat a plate of that for lunch if they let me.

Really impressed that a restaurant called \"Roasting Company\" had so many great vegetarian options. Additional shoutout for being gluten-aware and offering lots of gluten-free options."}
{"text":"Meh...

It wasn't bad or good.  I ventured here since it is close to my place of work, and I didn't feel like driving to my favorite Rotisserie Chicken restaurant in Dilworth (which also gets great reviews).  The Jaco sauce was the best part of the meal in my opinion.  Everything else was just OK.  

Next time I won't be so lazy and just drive to where my taste buds lead me.  I would eat there again in a pinch, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Great chicken, be sure to ask for a side of the BBQ sauce (much better than the sauce on the table).  Sides are excellent - try the collard greens and sweet potatoes.  This is a takeout staple for me during the winnter months."}
{"text":"Hit this new location today for lunch.

LOVE this new place and love the new look.   It has a Plaza Midwood feel and some character of the old structure....but looks updated and somewhat rustic.   I liked the vibe a lot.

The set up is great.  BAR in the front.   Food service and Dining in the back. 

The food was just as tasty as the other location.....I believe this will be my new location to attend as the one on Montford is dingy and gross.

I love the food....but what I love most is that you dont have service staff....you take care of yourself and leave when you are done.  

All in all....this new spot is great.   Give it a whirl."}
{"text":"Great food, and friendly staff. Lots of draft beer options if the food isn't enough for you. Homemade sides and delicious chicken all made on site. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place rocks! First visit this evening and the food was incredible. We had takeout which was packed perfectly for travel. Our selection was a 1/2 Rotisserie Chicken dinner with coleslaw, pasta sald, mashed squash, cornbread stuffing & cornbread. The chicken cooked perfectly juicy with great tasting skin was amazing. All the sides were perfect, but the cornbread stuffing will be coming home every time we eat here. The Staff were so friendly I felt at home. Great location, great food, great people. 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"I just love this place. So many choices for chicken and my fav is the chicken and rice with tico sauce. Add a side of the tico black beans and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"So here's the deal. It's maybe 1AM, and a few friends and I coming out of EB discover that they'd opened up a roco in plaza. We were drunk and ecstatic. More ecstatic than drunk, but drunk nonetheless. I expected any subpar food that we could find to be delicious but never in a million years did I expect ROCO to let me down. It was late, and although they were serving food still, they had run out of almost everything. No 1/4 dark meat or white meat. All they had was the pulled white meat. We all ended up ordering the jacko chicken. The chicken was dry, flavorless, lukewarm, and underwhelming, and the jacko sauce was salty and overwhelming. Jacko sauce was nothing more than hoison sauce maybe mixed with soy sauce to make it more salty. It tasted gross on bland chicken. Potatos were cold. The greenbeans were ok. In my drunken stupor I'd rate it a 2 out of 10. If I were sober probably a 0 out of 10. Bartender was very nice, patient, and friendly."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent and affordable comfort food, primarily chicken based. It's a laid-back place and a nice change of pace on Montford. It's a no-frills establishment and you'll be served quickly. My favorite dish is the chicken nachos. I definitely recommend heading here if you want a good, tasty, quick meal."}
{"text":"Awesome... awesome..... awesome!  Fantastic chicken, great sides!   The food is awesome and fast.  Lots of great local beers on tap! 
It's even open late!"}
{"text":"This was a excellent choice. My food was delivered nice and hot , and ahead of time  ! I love this place being that I'm a vegetarian they have excellent choice of veggies that are delish! Will be ordering again"}
{"text":"Chicken was very tender, nice size pieces, collards and apples were tasty as well. Only giving 4 stars as they should have their own signature sauce! Will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte. A staple of Montford Dr. Best chicken in town. Legendary sides. Great bar area now. Quick. Priced right. Try the 1/4 white. Smoked cheese and pasta. Side salad. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Very good, cheap food. 

Lunch (12pm) was crowwwd-ed, no tables and a line out the door, so we ended up getting stuff to go. They have the take-out system down, with little containers lining the salsa bar so you can grab whatever you'd like to pile onto your tacos or whatever.  Interesting variety of flavor here, ranging from tex mex (medium salsa) to cumin-y mexican (jaco). The unsalted heat of the pico was rad. There were even little packets of malt vinegar. Dude.

The collards were the highlight for me. Deeply smoky, bitter and tart, and just salty enough. Wolfed 'em down. Squash casserole was meh, but other sides, and the 3 pound veggie wrap, were all delicious and unique.

I whine about this area being an annoying drive from where we live, but there's so much awesomeness here, might be time to park an RV somewhere clandestine and have a weekend pad in this cool little area of \"south park\". Or just quit whining and deal."}
{"text":"This place was a great place for lunch on Sunday.  My friend and I stopped here to grab a quick bite to each before we headed back to Columbia.  Overall, the place was very good.  The chicken tasted delicious...perfectly cooked and seasoned great.  My only complaint was that I would like to have a bit more skin.   the cornbread dressing was great and the baked beans, best ever!  My friend got the pulled porked over rice.  He said it was very good as well.  They also have a decent sized bar with a good selection of local brews as well. The price was under $10 for a 1/4 chicken, 2 sides, 3 pieces of corn bread and sweet tea.  Wait time was under 5 minutes, very fast!"}
{"text":"Chicken is awesomely tender, beer selection is stellar but you come here for the sides. The squash casserole and smoke cheese pasta salad are a revelation. No leftovers tonight."}
{"text":"My buffalo chicken wrap was amazing and affordable. The bartender was very helpful and nice. Definitely want to try more off the menu"}
{"text":"This is my go-to lunch place where my office is located.  Their lunch is always fast and fresh.  A plethora of veggies to choose from and fresh rotisserie chicken!  In and out in under 30 min with a fresh and healthy lunch...that's winning in my book."}
{"text":"I've been to this place about 3 times at different times of the day..... They're consistently on point! I sat beside I guy that says he's been going for over 20 years!! Prices are very affordable and they pack the plates!! Check it out don't be lame"}
{"text":"We tried RoCo tonight for the first time and it was fine. We live on the other side of town and I wouldn't make a special trip just to visit here. The positive is that we had dinner for 2 and a OMB Copper for $23.75, the stir fry veggies and the corn bread. I love veggies but the green beans had a flavor to them that I didn't care for. My husband enjoyed the garlic roasted potatoes. I sampled his and will say that they are VERY VERY garlicky. He had the chicken and rice and liked it well enough. I had the quarter white meat. I guess with all the fantastic reviews, my expectations were a little too high. I didn't feel like it had any different flavor than a Costco rotisserie chicken that I can buy for $4.99. I just wasn't feeling it."}
{"text":"OMG I love this place. The smoked gouda pasta I come here for that mainly as well as the squash casserole. I love the chicken as well as the chicken pot pie and chicken and dumplings. If I could eat here everyday for lunch I would. unfortunately it take to long for me to get there for lunch as often as I would like. they have opened a second location though which is a bonus."}
{"text":"You guys know they have a new location on Eastway and the plaza. more space and still the same good food. I love the smoke gouda pasta and the rotisserie chicken. they tell me chicken pot pie day is the busiest because they are so good and the pie is huge. all the side items are good especially the squash casserole."}
{"text":"I ordered wings and veggies to go.  They were fast and ready when I got there.  The wings are very good, big and meaty.  The evil wings (Hotter than regular wings) were great, but I was expecting hotter.   I will go back =)"}
{"text":"I had never been to The Roasting Company and am a fan of roasted chicken, so I was excited when this location opened up closer to our house. We went on a recent weeknight and each ordered a half chicken with two sides to give us dinner and lunch for the next day. The employee who we placed our order with was super friendly and helpful. He recommended that I order their most popular sides: garlic potatoes and squash casserole. My husband ordered rice and collards.

The food came out pretty quick and was fresh. The chicken was aaaaaaamazing. Fall off of the bone delicious! I loved the garlic potatoes and the little corn bread muffin. While the squash casserole may be popular, I wasn't a fan of it. It tasted more like cornbread stuffing with a little bit of squash in it. My husband wasn't overly wowed by the rice or collards. But really, we were there for chicken and we will definitely be back for the chicken."}
{"text":"Don't  get me wrong - the food here was DELICIOUS - I got the chicken and black bean combo with squash casserole (recommended by my friend Hannah) and lima beans (a special veggie that day).  And the service was fast.  

It's just the personalities that I had a problem with.  I hate it when staff at places like to \"joke\" with you and tell you that they're out of something or can't do it.  See my review for Chicago q on how staff should act.  That's all. 

Oh, another good thing is that they had fruit punch in their fountain machine... That was fun too."}
{"text":"Ventured to the Roasting Company after being guided here by coworkers.

Atmosphere - Dive-y, old, been here forever feel, busy, rickety table & chairs, diner-esque.

Food - opted for the chicken & black bean combo platter w/ sweet potato mash and corn bread.  The meal is basically pulled chicken on a bed of rice that is drizzled w/ a, black in color, barbeque soy tasting sauce called Jaco sauce.  The flavor was okay but too salty soy for my liking.  The sweet potato mash was dark in color and kind of bland in taste.  The corn bread was just okay.

Service - Yep, at ordering you kind of feel obligated/ guilt-ed into tipping when basically you do all the work w/ the exception of clearing the table.  I would rather leave cash for the table cleaners on the table and not tip on the credit card receipt.  That way I know that they would truly get the tip.   

Overall - It was just okay...nothing great.  I may give them another try if in the area but I would not go out of my way to stop here."}
{"text":"I see the cause for the mixed reviews. Hard to get bar service when there's no empty seats at the bar. I appreciate how after 10 minutes of sitting there no one at least came over. Even though I didn't get to see the manager I see all the reviews about the poor management. First time here, and the last. Get yourself a staff that cares."}
{"text":"Chicken Pot Pie Wednesdays... How I love thee!!!  I have only been here on Wednesdays and it's the only day that they serve up the Chicken Pot Pie meant for the Gods.  They only make a certain number for the day but if you get there before 12:30pm, then you should be fine.  It really starts getting crowded after 12pm.  The Pot Pie is large and you really concentrate hard if you want to finish it in one sitting.  There is no shame with taking the rest home and saving it for late night grub.  Still good!!  Also, definitely try the green sauce on the table.  Mmmmmm mmmm.

Although I haven't tried the other food there (BBQ Homestyle), I've only heard the best things.  So give it all a try.  But honestly, 5 stars for the Pot Pie.  Enjoy!

-Ian M."}
{"text":"3.99 or is it 4.99 - either way you can get a very affordable vegetable plate at this spot and I for one am absolutely loving it! Most places charge about double for the same food, so why not get a filling meal for under $5? Had their collards, squash casserole, and potato salad for dinner tonight and it was pretty decent for what it was. Probably wouldn't order the squash again - tasted way too sweet or the potato salad - nothing was dill like about that said (or maybe I've spent too much time around Russians), but again for the price point I can't be too critical. Decent food for a very fair price and the ambiance is super casual and laid back. Perfect place to grab a beer with a colleague or get a quick bite with a friend. I'll have to try their chicken next time."}
{"text":"I often pick up an order to go and it is always ready in a very short amount of time.  I LOVE the rotisserie chicken salad.  It's huge and always a ton of meat piled on top.  The roasting company is consistent and always delicious!"}
{"text":"This is just a cool place. Comfort food is my favorite and I love how I can basically order a thanksgiving meal in the middle of summer if I wanted to."}
{"text":"The Roasting Company's most endearing thing to me (being that I am a night shifter) is the late hours all week. On several occasions my boyfriend and I have gone late at night when we're finally ready to eat or have had late work meetings and can't grab dinner until 1030. With that being said, every time I have been in it is super chill with a small (and mostly quiet) group of people inside. There are plenty of beer options, we always sit at the bar since it's always late, and have never had any problems with service. The portions are huge for what you pay, you won't leave hungry. The food is good, you're not going for five star here, but it is always cooked properly and hits the mark for its cuisine category. I do love the cornbread, it actually has pieces of corn in it, and I normally am not a fan of cornbread. My partner and I at work even grabbed dinner at 1AM the other day, being we work on an ambulance, they were extremely quick to prepare our food--We were very grateful!! Good spot for a casual late night when you're starving and not looking to be fancy."}
{"text":"Very good roasted chicken served as 1/4, 1/2 or whole.  I had 1/4 chicken with Mac n cheese and a tossed salad.  Chicken was hot and tasty, not spicy.  Mac 'n cheese had a little spicy kick that added to the flavor.  Ordered to go and it was ready within 5 minutes. Hot and fresh.  Very reasonably priced and open late.
Adjacent bar had outdoor seating and was very lively."}
{"text":"I alway visit this spot when I'm in Charlotte. This is my go to place when I feel like comfort food. It has a really chill laid back feel that anyone that comes in will be welcomed. I always get the chicken and rice with queso. I also pair it with with cornbread stuffing and green beans. The cornbread stuff is very savory but it's a little heavy on the salt for me. The green beans aren't anything special. I wish they would give them a little love tho. I think they are out of a can from the looks and taste,but hey they are known for the roasted chicken so you know."}
{"text":"Always eat the same thing when I go... two chicken tacos w/black beans. First off, the black beans are AMAZING... good flavor, spicey and vegeterian! I cant get enough of them. The tacos are huge, they put a ton of chicken (almost too much) but they are a little dry... I add the mild and medium salsa and sour cream to mine... I can typically only eat 1 and save the other for later. This was my first time for lunch, typically I get dinner and the place was packed, looooong line. If you are not dining in or have time crunch I suggest ordering ahead."}
{"text":"YASSS. I don't usually eat southern food due to the lack of availability near me, but I love it here. The dark and white meat chicken were both nice and juicy, no dryness in sight. Their cornbread is delicious. I've never had cornbread that had corn in it before. The squash casserole is delicious. I've never had that either. Then again, I don't really eat casseroles.
The atmosphere is very comfortable and the prices are cheap. There's parking all around if you can't find it in their lot."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. The sides tasted liked they came out of a can, and I bought better roasted chicken at the grocery store. The sweet mashed potatoes looked absolutely DISGUSTING. They were GRAY! Also, they ran out of their special. It was 2 p.m. How could you possibly run out of the special at 2 pm?? I don't recommend this place and I will never go back. It was gross."}
{"text":"Yes, I can be a condiment queen, but I like to be able to play off the flavors that already exist in the dish... at the Roasting Company I feel like they're making me do all the work. 

I get the appeal, I understand why this is a favorite of many friends, but it just isn't for me. (Clearly plenty feel they're doing something right if they're continually busy at standard meal times.) Either my sandwich is so loaded with meat and liquid (calling it sauce would mislead you to thinking it has a taste) it disintegrates faster than I can chew, or I feel like I just ate a plate of bland, watered down... what did I order? Luckily, there is a salsa bar and the tico sauce, but I want my pork to be able to contribute SOMETHING to my lettuce and tomato on tortilla. 

I will admit, some of the sides are tasty. But with the options in town for rotisserie chicken and even tacos, this does not fall high on my list. Unlimited refills are nice, service is speedy, and the staff at the counter is friendly."}
{"text":"A co-worker picked this place and boy am I gald she did.  I ordered the evil wings and the roasted vegetables.  My co-worker got the roasted chicken.  All the food was very good.  I also got a side of the Nuclear sauce.  Wow was that good!  I will get the nuclear wings next trip even though the evil sauce was really good too.

The best thing about the evil sauce is that its different."}
{"text":"After the great reviews I expected something... good. Instead I was completely underwhelmed. So-so to gross ingredients, edible but barely. Will not be going back here."}
{"text":"Yes, I have continued to give The Roasting Company, year after year, a try because of the talk and good reviews. However, unfortunately I do not get it. From the service to the food, everything is a let down in my mind.
Last night, almost a year after my last review, I decided to try them again for their so called \"great\" chicken and dumplings. Okay, if you like mushy dumplings with no flavor this dish is for you. Blah, wouldn't order again.
It comes with one side and cornbread. Cornbread was hard as a rock and cold, ugh! However I will say the mixed veggies were pretty good. But, honestly, how badly can you mess up stir frying veggies?

So, with this final review I am going to pass on this place, too many great restaurants out there with some of the same food options."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited about eating here but my food tasted like they threw it in the microwave & warmed it up.. not freshly made AT ALLLL... my bf had honey hot wings & they were the absolute top 5 wings I've had in my life! Maybe they were in a rush but I was so upset"}
{"text":"This place is so good it made me rethink leaving the restaurant industry. I've had the chicken pot pie (wed special) a half chicken and the squash casserole. Very delicious indeed!"}
{"text":"Roasting Company to me is like a Boston Market substitute (gasp!!!).  It's not that it's not good, but I just like Boston's chicken a little better because it's seasoned a little better.  But since Roasting Co. is close to work, it is a nice alternative when I plain refuse to go to yet another fast food joint.  

The food is fast, consistently decent and relatively cheap.  I normally get the quarter dark, but today I decided to get a half dark (which is only $1.53 more) and now I have leftover for another meal... much more economical :)  Seasoned corn was a little disappointing for it's not seasoned much.  Squash casserole was ok, not super cheesy so I feel like I was being semi-healthy.  Overall the veggies were both little too blend for my taste.  

It's a solid place for lunch, especially they have a few outdoor tables so we can also get a dose of Vitamin D on a sunny day."}
{"text":"My favorite chicken place in Charlotte since the early '90s. EVERYTHING is great and the Jaco sauce is the bomb. Chicken and black bean combo is my all time fav."}
{"text":"It's been 15 years or so since the last time I ate here; i.e., pre-marriage, children, etc. However, it was a bit nostalgic to come back with wife and family in tow. While the vibe is a bit different, they have given the building a facelift and added a brew pub, the food taste and quality is just as I remember. Reasonably priced family food is not always easily found, so I was pleased. I don't know the next time I'll be back, but would definitely come around again the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Not a typical rotisserie.  I was expecting some else before walking into the Roasting Company, but I was pleasantly surprised in my findings.  

Two options for ordering when we went their for lunch.  Either order at the standard chowline formation, or you can place a order at the bar too.    This would be a great place for group outings as people can order and pay separately with ease.

I got the chicken wrap and it was delicious.  FYI it was more of burrito than a wrap. Also, you should make sure to try the Costa Rica sauce that is offer by the salsa bar."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I frown on animal abuse, but I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't glad someone killed all those chickens and let Roasting Company cook 'em up for me. This is the best restaurant under $20 in the city. I want an iv of Tico Sauce hooked up to me. Will it kill me? Probably. Don't care though. 

Overall: A+"}
{"text":"In the couple of years since I last visited, the Roasting Company has added a \"taproom\" area where they have table service AND BEER. I had no idea!

The chicken is still absolutely great. Moist and tasty. I'd recommend the chicken and black bean con queso. Or one of the chicken pot pies if they haven't sold out. Add a scoop of salsa (mild, hot or very hot) from their salsa bar.

Other than the beer menu (and spirits too), there is a Coke fountain and urns of sweet/unsweet tea."}
{"text":"Viva The Roasting Company!  This place has a great Costa Rica chicken rotisserie style food. It's also located in the heart of the ever popular Montford Drive. And there is even a private parking lot for this place - imagine that!  

The food is mainly chicken, and I usually go for the quarter white meal which comes with two of their great sides. Try the cinnamon apples as one of them - you won't be disappointed. And it's like having dessert. I also recently tried their chicken salad sandwich and thought the chicken salad itself was done really really well. Oh and Wednesday's are chicken pot pie days - rather large ones too.

Inside the place has been remodeled and expanded. They now have a large bar which makes for a great evening scene and will keep them in business even longer. I prefer to sit in one of the tall booths. They make you feel like you and your compadres are dining in a private room. There are also some swanky high top tables as well.

So if you are a carnivore, go check out this great chicken restaurant!"}
{"text":"Where else can you pick from a full menu that has chicken con queso, rotisserie chicken, and vegetarian dishes at 12am? That would be the Roasting Company. I come here about once a week and the food is to die for. I love the squash casserole and the smoked pasta salad. Haven't had any other sides really because I've fallen in love with those two. But PLEASE get the chicken con queso. It will change your life. For real for real.

Also, if you go around 5 or 6pm, prepare to wait if you don't call in your order. It's not a bad wait, but it's just a lot better to call in. You may hold, but the staff is VERY courteous and they will make sure you're taken care of.

And you get cornbread with every entree.. And cornbread is amazing.

Oh! And the bartender who is regularly there is awesome. Very knowledgable about beer, wine, and the food menu. So grab a drink and chat with him!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but there was just something about the meal I had that just was not right.  Maybe it was my fault to get the dish that had almost every ingredient in it.  I will certainly try them again and hope for the best."}
{"text":"Great place ! Great atmosphere! It's already my second time here and I'm sure coming back !
The staff is very nice and it's always full of people ! Its very recommended to come here on the weekend ."}
{"text":"Am I missing something here? I just do not find that their food is very flavorful. 

The vibe and decor are pretty cool. We came here to meet some friends for beer specials (which are apparently very reasonable on Fridays) and shared a plate of nachos. Decently sized, but we had to put a lot of cholula and their habanero sauce on the chicken to give it some sort of taste. 

Not my favorite, but that's okay since Viva Chicken opened up just a little ways down Park Road."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years and am never let down. The roasted chicken is the best I've ever had. Their chicken, rice and black beans dish is amazing. I don't know what's better, the chicken or the side dishes. Their roasted potatoes are great, sweet potatoes are amazing. The corn bread is the absolute best. If you feel like good comfort food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. From the delicious, fall-off-the-bone chicken, to the random chicken + something delicious + something else delicious combos, you can't go wrong with anything at The Roasting Company. The sides are all great, especially the spicy mac and cheese on Saturdays and the corn muffins that come with are scrumptious and have corn and green chilies in them. And while the food is always great, the service is always spectacular as well! Everyone who works there must be constantly eating the food because they are ALL so happy! Their to-go option is great too. Call it in and scoot directly to the front of the line to pick it up. And, while this might sound trivial, the food is packaged up well so you don't have any crazy spills on the way home."}
{"text":"I used to think more highly of the Roasting Company but a few recent visits left me wanting a little bit more flavor or tenderness with my chicken.  Perhaps my tastes have changed in my old age.  Anything is possible.

Anyway, RC excels in their side items with many having a southern twist to them including mashed sweet potatoes, collards, etc.  For meals they feature tex mex items like burritos and then they also have rotisserie chicken.  

They have a small salsa bar and a few sauces on the table.,  The hot sauce has a nice smokey flavor to it and goes well with anything you put it on.

The restaurant can get very busy at peak times so you may have to wait until at table is cleared before you sit down."}
{"text":"Been 4 times. First time, the bar and food were great. Chicken, beans, rice, sides delicious, big portions. 

2nd visit, bartender was very rude and treated us poorly. Actually, the manager was awesome about it and he got us to come in 3rd time. 

3rd time, food was good... But not great. Pork, rice, pasta salad (yum). It is all, however, just a bit bland (this coming from someone who hates added salt). 

4th time, last straw... You lost me. Come to dinner at 630pm. Out of Buffalo chicken sandwich special. How in the world does that happen? I wound up finishing my beer and heading to kickstand to get a real, live, Buffalo chicken in the wild. 

It's 50/50 at this point. I am, unfortunately, out. Too many other consistent spots.  I know management cares, but consistency is a BIG problem."}
{"text":"The cute bartender from Boston convinced me to have a cider...I never order cider.  It was refreshing nevertheless.  The atmosphere in this sports bar/ restaurant was chill.  I'd certainly come back in here to try the food out and sit at the very expansive bar area.  They've also got some good family/group seating space for you to come and get comfortable.  There's a lot of brews available on tap; what more can you ask for?  The bartender, aside from my vane reason earlier was very friendly and nice to chat with. Everyone seemed to be a fan of her.  I liked this place; the location just kind of threw me off initially as it was located in a strip mall. Nice place nevertheless."}
{"text":"I am astonished! When in walked up I thought this experience would be boring but quite the opposite.   

My taste budswere thrown for a loop! What the heck is in the squash casserole? Delicious! And how about their own \"Tico Sauce\" made and sold right here on location.  A very interesting blend of spices inspired by Costa Rica.  Very nice!

I shall be Back!"}
{"text":"The Roasting Company is delicious which is why it's been around for so long. They offer so many great sides and let you know which items are gluten free!"}
{"text":"On a quick trip in Charlotte and RoCo was recommended by friends.  It is on Montford Street with lots of other good looking places.  I wasn't exactly sure of the ordering process when I stepped into the restaurant but quickly figured it out and went to the window on the right.  My buddies suggested I go with the chicken and queso.  I threw in the black beans too for the \"queso combo.\"  For my sides I got the oft-mentioned squash casserole and cole slaw.

The chicken, queso, and black beans was really good.  All of the flavors blended well but you could still taste each individual component.  I actually really liked the slaw too.  It was more tangy than sweet as some cole slaw can be.  I didn't love the squash casserole as much as others have but I thought it was good.

The woman who took my order was very nice.  Don't go in here looking for decor.  These folks focus on the food and do that well.

I look forward to trying more think from RoCo on future visits."}
