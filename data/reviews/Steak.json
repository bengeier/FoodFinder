{"text":"i am actually very surprised by the reviews found here. ive been to steak two times with my boyfriend, and loved it every time. i would recommend it especially on tuesdays and thursdays (i believe) when ladies drink free and/or everyone drinks free as well. i believe alcohol is a good way to start a dinner
in regards to the appetizers, i was not impressed and ill admit that. however, the bread basket was pretty good. the service has always been great. the server was more than willing to send back my filet mignon when it came back overcooked. 
i loved the steak selection.. i especially enjoyed the fact that you could pick your own sauce, neat addition. im a big carnivore and thought it was great to find a good steak restaurant without having to go on the strip or summerlin. 
moreover, the wine menu was definitely impressive... me and my bf are both cava drinkers and there was a decent selection of bubblies in general. 
go and check it out especially when they send out the $25-off coupon!"}

I have to admit that have been transformed. I have visited Steak with my wife only because of the other cuple that we where with, they always talk about it. So we went and to my suprise it was actually very good. We went on a friday night and the restaurant was full so the nice young hostess told us it will only take a few min to get a table, we sat at the bar and waited, while we where waiting i discovered  that they have a wine shop, and boy what a wine shop it is. So we finelly get sat, about 10min, and we get our first round of drinks and we place our order, we took the advice of our waitress and order the special app which was a rock shrimp tempura (amazing) I had the 24oz bone in rib eye with scalloped potatos and leek and corn a great MR steak. The rest of the party was also some what over the moon to be honset, it's been a while since I've enjoyed a place as much as this one.
keep up the good work"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. Very tasty dishes. The wine store next door really makes this place a winner. You can buy the wine at very very reasonable prices and pay a $10 corking fee. David, the owner, manager, bus boy, host, DJ, bartender, etc. has above average wine recommendations and has never steered us wrong. 

The food never fails to deliver good flavor. Portions are generous. Prices are reasonable. My favorite selling feature - it's in my neighborhood!

Check out Wednesday nights. Very nice atmosphere with great music. It's making the strip less enticing every day."}
{"text":"I live in the area and STEAK is now closed.
We tried it out the first month they were open and never returned.
No need to go into detail since they are no longer around."}
{"text":"This place closed totally abruptly...and I was SO SAD!  I was there a couple days prior....and we made plans to meet there again.  My friend beat us there and called us a bit confused.  \"Why is it closed, i thought it was 24 hrs?  Why are there no tables or chairs inside?\"  

WTFFFF?  (thats right, its so dramatic it needs 4 Fs), it had closed.  Without even letting anyone know.  Boo!"}

Saturday night at 9 pm, STEAK's bar was filling up as the Floyd Mayweather v. Ricky Hatton fight was being shown on their TVs.  I guess this may also explain our initial service when we arrived.

We chose a table close to the bar so we can still see the screens while enjoying our dinner.  (There weren't any seats available at the bar.)  We actually had to ask for our menus since we were forgotten so quickly.

Water and bread were soon to arrive and I was pleasantly surprised with the two hummuses offered alongside the olive oil and balsamic vinegar concoction.  We had to wave someone down so we could get our orders in and I guess everyone was too busy watching the fight.  

We decided to go straight for the beef since a place like STEAK should offer some really good stuff, right?  I went for the Petite Filet Mignon (8 oz.) with Provencal sauce ($27).  It comes with two sides - I chose the scalloped potatoes and saute mushrooms.  When my meat arrived, I can definitely say it was very rare, just like I requested.  The meat lacked flavor and the sauce was just okay.  The saute mushrooms were REALLY good though and thank goodness I got that to add to my  beef.  The scalloped potatoes were quite impressive - about six layers of potato slices and six layers of cheese came out in a hearty serving.  I found this to be quite generous.  The potatoes were just okay in my opinion, but the BF ate it all up!

The BF went straight for the Boneless Rib Eye with Bearnaise sauce and Cabernet Reduction sauce ($27).  (The waiter was nice enough to give him two sauces.)  He chose the mac & cheese and STEAK fries for his two sides.  The meat was more medium than medium rare unfortunately, so it was too much for me to chew.  He did find his steak to be medium rare in a different part of the beef though.  The mac and cheese was rather grainy, not how I particularly like it.  (I like mine smooth and creamy.)  We both liked the STEAK fries though - they reminded me of when my dad would have potato slices and pan fry them instead of deep frying them. (It made us want to go home and make them ourselves!)  The cabernet reduction was okay, but it was the bearnaise sauce that had me going.  It was so buttery and fatty, and oh so good!  Dipping the STEAK fries into that sauce was oh so good!     

We were both very full after our dinner and the additional serving of bread I had requested.  I did peruse the dessert menu and saw things like Cotton Candy, Marinated Berries, and Basque Cake that struck my fancy.  (All desserts were $10, except for the cotton candy which was $8).

Overall, the food was just okay.  They had some really good sides, but their meat entrees were just average.

Service was much better once we got a designated waiter.  The staff were moving furniture around and left the doors open behind us causing a draft.  Our waiter made a point of closing the doors as other employees would continuously leave it open.  Thank goodness for him! 

They are definitely trying to make this a neighborhood place to hang out with weekly events like: 

Open Bar on Mondays and Thursdays from 5 pm to 7 pm.
Live Music on Saturdays at 10 pm.  (We left before this started.)
Wine Tasting on Saturdays from 3 pm to 5 pm.

We would consider going back and checking out their wine menu more or even grabbing dessert and hanging out by the bar.  I don't think we would return back for the steak though.

{"text":"I recently had dinner with some friends at this establishment and noted the following:
-good wine shop
-bad waitstaff and  average food...especially for the price
-ugly comment by bartender about having previously worked at Viaggio and how owner pours cheaper alcohol into more expensive bottles...wow...pretty sour grapes
That said, there are plenty of places to buy wine other then this restaurant/wine shop.  If you want a culinary adventure in a Henderson independent restaurant try Todd's Unique Dining."}
