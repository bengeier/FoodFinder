{"text":"By far the best server I've had in a while, and I know a some of the crew from Dresslers/Porters House (and those guys are always great), however, the food left a little to be desired. Best dish of the night was the grilled oysters with bacon and jalapeno. Worst dish of the night was a neutral split between the duck and the fried oysters.   The cheese plate (since we were ordering to split between 2-4 people for each dish) had enough bread for one of the cheeses only, and to be 100% honest, I expected better cheeses.....it was a very boring medley of blue, manchego and cheddar.   The shrimp bahn mi was a disappointment as well. Expected a true bahn mi style dish.....I understand the deconstructed(ish) approach, but with something quintessentially bread based, it needs to have some kind of component that relatively mimics the name. Or just simply change the name to Vietnamese style shrimp.  The chilled lobster tail was okay...not great. Just a plain jane, cooked lobster tail....with nothing on it.   The two constructive criticisms on the two worst dishes. Just lose the fried oysters.....the oysters you have are great....I suspect that the oysters you're frying are an exceptional way to get rid of the dated ones. Unfortunately, it kinda tastes that way too.....like the dish was an after thought.  The duck.....most places in Charlotte have a similar problem cooking their duck. The fat cap isn't scored, and the fat isn't slowly rendered off.....leaving a giant jiggle of fat under the seared bit. Not appetizing, and the rest of the dish was exceptionally bland.   Having said that, the calamari was stellar. The beet salad was good too. Would give it a second go at some point to check it out again. The good items were VERY good....."}
{"text":"Fin and Fino is a great restaurant. It has a modern and casual feel once you get inside the restaurant. The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous. The customer service in the restaurant was amazing. Our waiter knew the menu like the back of his hand which was very impressive. We went during lunch and the restaurant was not too crowded. At the first glance of the menu I noticed that there weren't any simple dishes and I am a simple lady. Everything seemed overly complicated but I am sure that is the purpose of the restaurant...differentiation from others. I ordered the tomato bisque and squash soup along with the salmon. I was sooooooooo impressed. The food was fresh and the salmon was delicious. Overall I think you should at least try this restaurant once. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It is fantastic to see the true culinary foundation of Charlotte growing with this Restaurant. There is finally a team in place that not only knows what is wanted, but what is needed to bring the true food scene to our City. I was lucky enough to be there on a day when the soup was a Lobster, sherry & saffron bisque. The wine list is inspired, the bar & Cocktails are unique, even the beers are well selected. Finally!"}
{"text":"Go check it out. Been there twice in the two weeks they have been open and I would recommend \"the treatment\" they roll out a bunch of different features of the menu to provide a melody of holy goodness. I am talking everything from oysters, homemade pasta, gnocchi, duck, quail, steak, you name it they do it, and do it well!! Don't forget the final course is dessert. I would personally recommend the cheesecake.   If you want to make it saucy, get a wine tasting/whole glass with each course they bring, it will make the experience all the more amazing.   Keep kicking ass Fin and Fino."}
{"text":"Great culinary experience!  Had lunch and was mildly disappointed at how thin the lunch menu was. I had looked over their dinner menu last night and was intrigued by about a dozen dinner menu items. The dinner lineup looked so good that I needed to explore Fin & Fino immediately. So, lunch.  Beautiful, uncrowded d√©cor! Service that was friendly and very competent!   Quick note; I don't get the name... Fin and Fino, what does that mean?  For lunch I selected 4 things 1. grilled Bahn Mi shrimp app, which was flat out spectacular. Served six perfectly grilled, decent sized shrimps. Cut these in half and had 12 ideally sized bites. Whatever it is they grill these things over, it gives the shrimp succulent, smoky char-grilled flavor. When you combine the pickled daikon/carrots, sriracha aioli, and popped sorghum onto your fork with a shrimp bite you'll have a nice sized, delicious bite. From start to finish, each bite was a wonderful taste treat! 2. soup of the day was shrimp gumbo. You could tell that this was a long, slow savory journey from cutting board till ending up in my bowl. Marvelous flavor, marvelous kinda-spicy seasoning, marvy aftertaste! 3. unsweet ice tea is something I'm particular about. Boom! Nailed it. brewed just right ... not sitting in a pitcher of melting ice for a long time before I ordered it ... refills were timely and delivered in a fresh glass ... Delicious Southern tea, just normal tasting, made like it's supposed to be, delicious tea! 4. half dozen raw oysters. The oyster menu is hidden in a separate menu that is really the drink menu. I never would have found them if I hadn't asked. The dinner menu is chock full of oysters. The St. Simon ones I had were elegant, sweet, wonderful looking (but undersized) oysters. Killer house-made sauce BTW! Also, Killer house-made crackers!  A re-visit to Fin and Fino for dinner is in my future"}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. The crab cake BLT with pork belly and green tomato relish was perfect. Not to mention, all sandwiches come with a light side salad, delicately dressed with a citrus vinaigrette. Well done guys, well done!"}
{"text":"First time in Charlotte, here on business.  If it weren't for the tasteful interior design and crisp nautical color palette, I'd be giving this place a half-star.  By 7:30pm, middle of dinner service, they were already sold out of the most appetizing thing I read on the menu: lobster & truffles with basil shells.  It was the main reason I'd decided to try this place-having checked out the menu beforehand.  Ok fine, hot new restaurants sometimes don't plan well enough and sell out of their most popular dish.  So I changed up and decided to try the calamari and cauliflower gratin.  The calamari was a disaster.  Something about that hoisin-chili sauce it was cooked in  just didn't work.  And I can usually enjoy any type of calamari no matter how it's seasoned by different establishments but this I just couldn't.  I sent it back after two bites.  I decided to remain positive about the cauliflower and waited for that to come out and then I ordered the monkfish as my protein replacement of the calamari.  They both came out at the same time and neither impressed.  The monkfish was completely over-cooked and both dishes were so salty I can feel my body retaining water as it breaks down all the salt from that food.  I didn't finish either dish.  As a saving grace, Fin and Fino did send me home with a complimentary cheesecake since I didn't really enjoy my dining experience.  That's a nice gesture, it honestly boosts my view of their customer service-which is always appreciated...I just have no faith I'm going to enjoy it at this point. #saltychicagoan #literallysaltyfromsaltyfood"}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised with this new uptown spot! The food was so fresh and creatively put together. I am typically not a raw oyster person but, the variety of the menu makes you excited to try new things all around! My service was immaculate! I felt that my server was ahead of the game! Every time I thought about needing something, he'd already put it on my table! In fact the service staff was attentive as a whole. They all seemed to be fully aware even of the tables around me. One thing that did throw me off was the huge contrast in uniforms between the servers and the bartenders. While they are all a nice-looking bunch, the bartenders wear a very fun denim outfit that looks carefree and comfortable. The servers however, wear white uniform shirts with aprons almost to the floor! It doesn't match the fun environment well. They just look uncomfortable in comparison but other than that (which is the absolute worst I can say) this place rocks and I'll be back as quickly as I can be!"}
{"text":"Oh my word, FINALLY CHARLOTTE. You have delivered and Fin & Fino did not disappoint.   Justin didn't have high expectations walking in, but something inside of me did, and we both left so thrilled with our experience from start to finish.  We weren't able to get reservations since we were last minute walking home and decided to pop in for dinner, which was fine, because the bar was perfect for us and it was totally meant to be because Rebecca, the bartender, was knowledgeable, kind, soft spoken, attentive, just asked enough questions, and took pride in taking care of her guests. I haven't had service experience like this in a long time and coming from the industry myself, it was so welcomed.  We split the Tower of Power. Looking back, we should have probably done the smaller tower and ordered the hot mussels because J didn't love the cold ones (but I did). We were *slightly* disappointed in the oysters on both taste and size, but over all were very happy.  We are so excited to visit again and try other dishes...and of course, sit at the bar.  The open concept of this space is gorgeous, airy and light. Love the kitchen windows and the cleanliness and the decor. It's the perfect date-night spot on all levels."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise ! The restaurant was just opened a week ago.  We opted for \"The Treatment \", which is a Chef tasting menu.  Flavor was crisp and clean.  The food portion was generous and the waitstaff was very attentive.  The over experience was just excellent."}
{"text":"While I haven't written any reviews in a little while, my visit to Fin & Fino has inspired me. I knew that they were opening sometime soon but I needed a hot tip from a friend last Saturday to know that they were opening essentially last weekend. Now the wife and I love all things seafood, so we were excited to try it all. Well her lobster allergy precludes her from trying all but Fin & Fino was very accommodating.  The menu is a little overwhelming with almost too many dishes to count to go along with dare I say the largest oyster list in the city. We both love raw oysters so we decided on 4 different varieties of north east oysters. We liked them salty and briny and they were. We followed those with some salmon and tuna poke which was well done with balanced flavors showcasing the fishies. Now for the next choices our server helped us and suggested that we do another small plate and share an entree. We obliged and agreed upon the scallops and latke, more on those later and the monkfish entree which while it came with a lobster sauce, they were able to plate the dish with the sauce on the side to avoid any need for an epipen, cause those are expensive, or a visit to the ER, cause that's even more expensive. The monkfish was cooked well and the tomatoes and kale were great accompaniments. Now onto the scallops and latkes. This was hands down my favorite dish of the night, while the wife may have another ultimate favorite we both agreed that the scallops/latkes were Charleston great. Trust us that's a thing. I try hard at home to cook scallops properly, sometimes they turn out better than others, but these scallops were probably the best I can remember. And the pairing of the scallops with the latkes along with the sour cream and lemon curd, at least I thought it was lemon curd was over the top. In fact when it came to dessert, we both decided to forgo the sweets and order each another small plate. The wife got the buckwheat pasta with shrimp and I, well I got another order of those scallops...  I would be remiss if I didn't mention the drinks and the bar. While we didn't hang out at the bar at all, it looks very well laid out and the drinks that we had were interesting and delicious. If you trust the bartender, try their \"waiting for magic\" offering which changes daily with unknown ingredients or get a drink off the menu or even go off menu, they will make you something good. They also have an extensive wine list if that's more your thing. The wife and I will be regulars, and they will be offering lunch as well as happy time from 4-6, which our server mentioned to us is still a work in progress on the full details. The price point is elevated a little, but if you don't like raw oysters and drink less than we do, you will be fine."}
{"text":"This place is amazing as its sister, Dogwood. The plates were all impeccable, and sauces were \"lick the plate\" good. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves quality food! The small plates varied in sizes, for prices reasonable for sizes ($11-$15ish.). 3 people split 4 plates and we were plenty full.  I would recommend to anyone to go... and look forward to trying their \"Treatment\" tasting."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for dinner and we loved it! We are both not picky and so we went for the Treatment where our server picked several items from the menu for us to try and a portion of the cost goes to charity. It was like a delicious seafood journey! Service was impeccable and the restaurant itself was beautiful. I even loved the hand soap in the bathroom (I think it was a little minty). There is valet parking and parking on the street."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!  I eat out multiple times a week while traveling for work and as a result am usually disappointed when trying a new restaurant.  Fin and Fino is one of the best places I've been to in a LONG time!    Took a friend here for her birthday and the \"Treatment\" is by far the best way to go!  $5 is donated to charity and it gives the most well rounded tour of the menu.  We had 7 small plate courses including oysters, shrimp, pork belly, beef, tuna tartare, scallops, fish and the most unbelievable cheesecake!!    Interior is well designed (minus the step when you first walk in) and spacious!  Seating is comfortable and service was excellent!   Take advantage of the option to reserve a table because this place isn't going to slow down any time soon!   Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, great service and food that comes out of that kitchen is miraculous.  We came in the Tuesday after they opened and have been back twice since.  It's cool that I'm not from Charlotte and when the bartender sees me automatically reaches for the 18yr old Macallan I drink.  The oysters are the best I've had outside of New Orleans.  Beautiful ambiance, great service again, and I also got to meet Anthony Hamilton one of my favorite R&B singers.  The art district is lovely in Uptown as well."}
{"text":"Best seafood restaurant in Charlotte by far and we've tried them all! Amazing customer service. Chris was awesome! When you go do the dealer's choice with a little guidance up front via \"The Treatment\" part of the menu and you won't be disappointed plus it's for a good cause."}
{"text":"My husband reserved this restaurant for my birthday. We had a lot of people and they did a great job accommodating us. Natalie was amazing ensuring all our guests were happy. Our waitress, whose name I can't remember (it was the awesome drinks) was great too. Keeping a group 22 isn't an easy task. She did a great job. Now on to the food. Amazing. The drinks were great too. Overall such an amazing experience I'd recommend them to anyone wanting to have a celebration with good food. Thanks fin and fino!"}
{"text":"The $55 Treatment is NOT the way to go!! We would've paid less just purchasing the items. The server pushed 'The Treatment' for dinner and said it would be a way to taste different items and they would bring more of the items we liked. We received a lot of food, some we liked and others we would've never ordered. The server never came back to ask if there were items we would like again. Total for The Treatment Option was $220 and if we would've just paid for the food brought to the table we would've only paid $174.  So, we lost $46 plus the added tax and tip gratuity. Total the table spent around $400 for food and drinks.  Lobster truffles, smoked salmon, poke bowl, and Moms Cheesecake was delicious!  I love scallops but they were salty. The other items were ok. The restaurant is beautiful and makes you feel like you're at the beach!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had in Charlotte . We ordered the Poke, ceviche , oysters, and BBQ quail . Each dish was fresh and flavorful. The service is excellent - our waitress Joanna was a sweetheart. I was very impressed and will certainly be back soon."}
{"text":"Update: 5/16 Sanitation Rating is up to 90! Going to give Fin & Fino another try. Fingers crossed!  88 Sanitation Rating not posted near the primary entrance... surprising for a brand new establishment. Food was good and fresh but the serving sizes could have been larger for the price. Same with the mock-tail I ordered. It was tasty and came in a cute cup, but it was mostly ice. Will try again IF the Sanitation Rating improves."}
{"text":"Fin and Fino had a few wins but overall a disappointing experience. The major issue is with regards to how they handled my food allergies; I was assured that all dishes I was served did would not include those items I'm allergic to. Five minutes after leaving the restaurant I knew hat wasn't the case and had a severe allergic reaction. Trusting that a restaurant is aware of the ingredients it's serving and is taking your health seriously is critically important. I'm not sure why this restaurant served me a dish with ingredients that I'm allergic to but it's unacceptable for any restaurant to do so.   Besides my allergy issue overall the interior/atmosphere is trendy and energetic. Wine list has some interesting bottles. Our server was attentive and seemed knowledgeable (I'm chalking the allergy issue to the kitchen, not her). The food was really the problem here. My husband was disappointed in his dishes, particularly the salmon flatbread and lobster and truffle; the flavors of truffle and salmon were lost in the other ingredients. I was served over cooked PEI mussels, half of which were inedible; because the dish was inedible they didn't charge me for it which I appreciated but the dish should never have been served. The fried oysters and beet salad were good, solid but nothing amazing.  I hope that Fin and Fino better accommodates those with food allergies going forward and focuses on improving the quality of its food. It has everything else going for it but due to the food experience we likely won't go back."}
{"text":"Great food!!!! The Treatment is a tasting menu for $50 can't lose!!!!!! On negative is they don't carry Patron Tequila"}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal! Spent the day exploring Charlotte with a group of friends and were all starving. We tried \"the treatment\" which is an interactive pre fixed designed by your waiter. With a great and interesting conversation about tastes and preferences our server Chris curated and amazing meal with more plates than I could count. The scallops were the best I have ever tried and the mussels beat that. Our waiter was the far and away the highlight of the dinner, he knew the menu in and out making selections that impressed the entire table. If you're looking for a dinner you'll remember please try Fin & Fino (and ask for Chris)."}
{"text":"We had a 5 o'clock reservation that got cancelled on us. They did not call to tell us about this until we we're already at the restaurant 5 minutes before our reservation."}
{"text":"Interior decorating is tastefully nautical with the decor above the bar - hanging seashells - and soft hints of blue and white.  Bartenders were spectacular - friendly and helpful in providing recommendations and crafting cocktails. If you love beer, they have a great craft list with beers I've never seen anywhere else in the city. One notable one was the key lime gose. As the beer started to warm up, you could taste hints of graham cracker. The wine list also looked great! Rebecca was great! She made a point to learn my name for the next time I come in.  Happy hour special 4-6 was Parmesan fries, a burger and one other sandwich item for under $10. All of the plates (for the most part) seemed shareable. You could go with a few friends and split 3-4 different dishes to sample the assortment.  The vibe was a mix of date night, girls night out and business people."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Every single aspect of our experience was exceptional right down to the smile on our waitress' face.  Food was incredible, we all had the chefs Treat. The Wagyu skirt steak was tasty like nobody's business."}
{"text":"Was not sure what to expect but was very pleasantly surprise... I sat at the bar and was immediately greeted and had great personalized attention throughout the night. The wine list is not your typical and if you're adventurous and want to try new grapes from all over the world this is the place. The seafood menu goes well with the wine list and the portions are perfect and delicious. Highly recommend this place. Dishes I tried were: Arctic Char Ceviche, Ahi Poke, Smoked Oysters, Cobia Crudo and Seared Tuna. All very well done. I look forward to coming back. Tks Tim and crew."}
{"text":"If you're coming here for dinner, the only way to do it is The Treatment. Basically, your server and the chef takes you on a tour of the menu. $50 per person. Bonus: $5 goes to a charity. How cool is that?  My friend and I were treated to an evening experiencing The Treatment. We had a little bit of everything: Oysters, Cobia Crudo, Grilled Shrimp Banh Mi, Skirt Steak, Duck, Beets, Lobster & Truffles, gnocchi with blistered tomatoes, dessert and more. I absolutely love oysters, so I see myself coming here often for those and drinks at the bar. My favorite thing we had: lobster & truffles (celery root brandade, basil shells, shaved truffle). Dear god, it was amazing. My dining companion and I actually fought over who got the rest of it.  From walking in, to the servers and the bartender, service was flawless. I loved all their recommendations. They went above and beyond to take care of us.   If you ever were in this spot when it was E2, you may remember how it was dark with deep reds and yellows. This is the complete opposite. Everything is open, white, bright, and beautiful.  This is from the same restaurant group that does Dresslers, Dogwood Southern, The Porter's House, so I knew before going in that it would be a fantastic experience. They do such a solid job with all their places.    If you are driving, they do offer free valet. Super convenient, especially since the parking deck can be confusing."}
{"text":"High hopes for Fin & Fino and, for the most part, it didn't disappoint.   Love the space and the build out-very tastefully done with lots of blue hues- nautical theme but not in a kitschy way.  Bar is very cool as well- good spot to saddle up for a drink and some small plates.   One rub is that with the open floor plan the decibel level is pretty high. Was difficult to hear anyone but the person next to you (we had a party of six) and dining room was only half full. Buyer beware. However, they were playing cool tunes from the 90's so that took the edge off..  On to the food. Some hits, some misses. Fried oysters were fantastic-great texture and perfectly cooked. Same with the Bahn Mi shrimp- great balance of heat and cool and a good mix of fresh veggie crunch that defines that sandwich. Mussels were a big hit as well- everyone was gaga over the broth and we needed extra orders of bread to sop up every last drop. Hanger steak was very good as well. Worth an order.   Now some of the clunkers... calamari was a bit bland and over cooked however will admit that we asked for it \"naked\" so the aioli may have saved it. Smoked salmon flatbread was bland- arugula salad on top needed some seasoning but that may not have salvaged it. Just blah. Grilled oysters were also flavorless- needed salt badly and the heat from the japs was lost in kind of a pool of nothingness. Faroe Island Salmon was steady but a bit over cooked on both our orders (which is a shame b/c that salmon is so damn good medium rare).  Service was very attentive and knowledgeable. A bit slow at times but not an issue at all.   Would certainly return and is a refreshing addition to the Charlotte dining scene."}
{"text":"Two stars.  Not because of the staff. Not because of the atmosphere or the absolutely amazing location and the food presentation is superb! Now the big question is the TASTE...definitely subpar!  First, my family ordered the banh mi shrimp, and as a Vietnamese person, I was expecting a toasted French baguette with shrimp in the middle.  I was totally wrong when it showed up. It was more of a banh mi-less shrimp (bread less) but they call it banh mi shrimp!  Nonetheless it tasted liked grill shrimp - OK.  Secondly, the skirt steak, presentation amazing but the the chef was too generous on the salt with it! Wayyy too salty!!! Cut it back like 10 notches chef! We also ordered the smoked salmon which was also salty! I gotta to admit, the place is fancy but the food needs to cut back on the salt! I think I got hypertension now. Overall superb staff, beautiful location but salty food!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  My husband and I visited Fin & Fino for the first time recently to celebrate our anniversary.  We live close to Dressler's in Huntersville, and it's become one of our favorite spots for fine dining.  We had hoped to have a similar experience at Fin & Fino.  It was close, but not quite.  We each had three dishes - two sides, and four \"entrees.\"  As this is tapas-style, your dishes will come out as soon as they are ready.  We started with the blistered tomatoes.  Honestly, this was my favorite dish of the night.  The tomatoes were cooked perfectly, and the dish had a good quantity of melted mozzarella and fabulous homemade gnocchi.     Next, came the scallops & latke and the lobster & truffles.  We preferred the scallops over the lobster.  The scallops and latkes were perfectly cooked (the latkes a little crispy), and the creme fraiche sauce was a nice complement.  The lobster was served with basil shells in a cream sauce.  The salty cream sauce drowned out much of the flavor of the small bits of lobster, and I couldn't taste the truffles at all.    Next, we received the wagyu skirt steak, shrimp with buckwheat tagliatelle, and cauliflower au gratin.  The wagyu was the biggest disappointment.  It was cooked perfectly medium rare, but had almost no flavor.  The shrimp tagliatelle was the most generous portion.  I really liked the light sauce, but the pasta was a bit overcooked.  The cauliflower was very good, but heavy with the cream sauce, and a bit salty.  We both had cocktails - I had the Good Sister (I think that was the name), and my husband had the #9.  They were good, but pricey.    Service was the star here.  Our server was very helpful and attentive, and we never wanted for anything.    Would we return?  Maybe, when they change the menu.  We had several very good dishes, but overall, I wasn't as impressed as I had hoped I'd be."}
{"text":"The Dressler family... and not merely those folks that are blood related to John and Kim Dressler, who spearhead Rare Roots Hospitality (yes, I had such a good experience last night that I looked them up - and we were also fortunate to meet and chat with the very amiable John), but all those who are part of their familial-feeling company are all enthusiastic, professional, knowledgeable and better than all that, make you feel like part of the family as well while you are in one of their establishments. There are a lot of great restaurants and eateries in and around the Queen City; some are great most of the time, some are great on one thing but miss the mark just a bit on another, but rarely do you find a restaurant where every part of your experience is on pointe - from the service to the space to the offerings, the innovation in uniquely crafted cocktails and thoughtfully prepared plates that make you excited to venture out of your 'comfort zone' - every SINGLE time.  The Dressler's have found and kept talented, engaging people in all levels of their staff or 'extended family' so much so that nothing ever gets overlooked and exceptional is the norm.  You just don't find it done better than this - not even in New York, LA or Chicago. As you may have guessed, I am a fan of other Dressler ventures - love Dogwood Southern Table in Southpark and recommended Dressler's to a colleague who raved about his evening. I should have known the experience would be no less but completely different at Fin and Fino - a bright star tucked beneath the Q.C. Skyline. Our server Andrew (and I honestly hesitate to call these folks servers as titles can be misleading depending on where you work; these professionals are not the same level of staff that you might find at your local wing place or watering hole) was so adept (as they always are at a Dressler's establishment) at recommendations, noting our individual preferences and palates, that it would be hard to adequately describe the scents, tastes and sensations of the meal that we enjoyed last night.  Suffice it to say, there is something for everyone, and everyone will feel welcome and at home. Without describing each dish or cocktail (try their sherries, you will be delighted and may find a new hobby!) I will just briefly note that the extensive list of oysters, the creative small plates and unique spirits were all memorable in their own right but were an epicurean symphony together. Make a reservation - you don't want to miss Fin & Fino."}
{"text":"What a great spot! Went here for dinner this afternoon, and boy did I have a great experience. Not only did I network with other people, I also enjoyed the food, drinks and atmosphere! I will soon become a regular, especially for your good girl/bad girl drink and banh mi shrimp!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a Thursday and were very impressed! My only regret is that we weren't hungry enough to do \"the treatment\" which is where you pay $50 per person and your server customizes a menu for your table. We ended up just getting a few small plates each and everything we tried was amazing. The scallops were fantastic and the poke bowl was delicious and surprisingly big! My friend decided to order the hanger steak, which we all poke fun at because it's a seafood restaurant, but it turned out to be incredible and one of the best things we tried! The tagliatelle was also very good and they give you a very big portion. Overall, we liked everything we tried! I was pleasantly surprised at the portion sizes because small plates tend to be tricky and sometimes end up being way too small. They also have an extensive wine list, but it's a tad confusing because it's grouped by what the wine will pair with and not the type of wine, so it's hard to tell what is red vs white, etc.  Overall, we really liked this place and definitely want to come back and to \"the treatment\"!"}
{"text":"Loved it! We often struggle with where to go to experience nice, crisp and inviting seafood. Today we found it. Fin & Fino was spectacular. The  Treatment is the way to go! Chef's choice and a range of options. It was enough for two, and then some. Icing on the cake is that dessert is included. Hands down one of the best new places we've tried. I also love that their cocktails are inspired by 90's music. Beautiful decor, moderately upscale feel, without the fuss."}
{"text":"Great scene. Menu tries to be ambitious but food generally bland. Bar service good. Red wine selection leaves a lot to be desired. Food is small plates. Good selection of vegetables but quality and flavor marginal."}
{"text":"Very lovely interior, friendly and good wait staff and delicious food...Even when the kitchen forgets to put key ingredients in the dish.  There seems to be very many/too many in the kitchen so maybe they are getting in each others way?"}
{"text":"Another in a long list of places I've been wanting to try but haven't gotten to previously.  Fortunately a work team dinner paved the way to finally try Fin & Fino.  Outstanding is the first word that comes to mind after the experience.  First off, any place that serves a lot of small plates automatically gets off on a good foot with me as I love variety in most all things but particularly when it comes to food.  Now, that is just the first step and if the small plates don't deliver, well...  Fin & Fino delivered and then some.  The beauty of a dinner with a team you're very close with is, sharing!  I was able to sample not only what I ordered but a bunch of other items as well.  Plus, a seafood tower was ordered for the table and just happened to land right in front of me which did not suck at all.  I ate, I shared, it was heaven.  The tower featured chilled oysters, mussels, shrimp, crab claws, salmon/tuna poke and lobster and it was all fresh and just delicious.  The cocktail sauce that came along with it was potent to say the least and I'm a lover of that horseradish kick.  Other things I was able to sample... BBQ quail, hot mussels with yummy broth, mahi, other kinds of raw oysters than what came on the tower, creamed crab and oysters (hot dish) and gnocchi.  It was all well prepared with the last two dishes listed being good but not as great as everything else.  Service from the middle of the table to my right seemed to be great but I heard the next day there were some issues at the other end of the table including hints of condescension coming from the server when some wine was sent back.  I didn't see or hear so not first hand but, I trust the sources.  End of the day, I came home raving about F&F to my wife and can't wait till we go back.  Thank you to the Dressler family for another CLT restaurant winner!"}
