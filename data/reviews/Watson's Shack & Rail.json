{"text":"I went for lunch. I need to go back for dinner to give a fully accurate review but here is the review for lunch. They seem a bit full of themselves. The menus was a sheet of paper where 1/2 listed the food items and the other 1/2 was advertisments for themselves. I don't want to see the prices for their apparel on my menu. Now that I am past the menu...

I ordered their chicken wings, husband ordered the chicago style hot dogs. Both were very good. They did the chicago style hot dogs justice. Too bad those were just a special and not an everyday menu item. The chicken wings were good and there were a lot for $10 so it was a good deal but if I am downtown and I want chicken wings I will go to Black Dog or Farren's which both have superior wings to these.

I had a fruity slush full of rum drink. That was good.

Basically the place was good. Not great. I could see going and sitting at the bar, drinking beers, eating wings (all you can eat wings should be a weekly special), and watching some sportball. But even that experience can be had at local places Guido's and Esquire. 

The best seat in the house is probably the front window where you can watch the goings on of Neil Street and you have a nice view of the Jane Addams Book Shop.

I will go back for dinner and try some of their more talked about food."}
{"text":"Holy cow. I ate there last night. I'm still dreaming about it. My husband and I split half a bird, fried. We should have gotten the whole bird because we devoured it. The chicken was perfect. A little spicy, perfectly crispy, juicy on the inside. Seriously delicious. 
For sides we got mashed potatoes & gravy and the pimento mac n cheese. Both were amazing. The cocktails were awesome, too. Seriously, it was all delicious.
Our server, Samantha, was really great, too. She took great care of our table of 6. 

We went on a Wednesday at 7:30 and it was only a 5 minute wait. I think we lucked out. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you've lived in Champaign long enough, you'll see a lot of familiar faces running the place in the front and in the back. That's were the familiarity ends, because the menu offerings are a breath of fresh air to this town that was suffering from an homogenization of cuisines.
We ordered the Nashville hot chicken: The batter was flavorful, crunchy and thick, while the chicken inside was moist and steamy. To top it off we got some of Shade's pickles, which I knew were not going to let us down."}
{"text":"I really like their fried chicken. I am not a huge fan of the slide of bread that comes with it. It would be better if it was Texas toast. As a displaced southerner, I enjoy the menu and atmosphere. 

I tried their fish and chips special on Friday. The texture and flavor were exactly what I hoped for. I enjoy cocktail sauce with my fish, which they don't have. However, they will give you horseradish which you can mix with ketchup to create cocktail sauce. 

Their drinks are also really good. I enjoyed the Daisy Buchanan which was a whiskey beverage. 

Their only major downside is wait time, but they do have a nice texting system, so we went over to the Blind Pig and had a beer while we waited."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I really, really wanted to like it. I can't say that I do. 

The good:
Their atmosphere is cool. It's a little crowded, but the inside of the restaurant has great ambiance. 
The hush puppies with come back sauce--yum! I could make those a meal. 
Our waitress was pleasant. 
Their sauces

The meh:
We were sitting very close to the table next to us. There was a child in a highchair that was noisy and felt like he was sitting with us because we were so close. 
Our waitress got my drink order wrong. It was noisy in there, so I'm sure she couldn't hear me. 
The noise level is kind of annoying. Talking to the people at your table can be difficult. 

The bad:
The star of this place is supposed to be the chicken. Unfortunately, it wasn't good. One of our pieces was partially raw. Another piece was almost burnt. The pieces that were cooked appropriately, lacked any flavor at all. The only way to give it taste was the sauce. Fried chicken at a restaurant that specializes in fried chicken should have a flavorful breeding. This was bland. The chicken was a bit dry, too. 
It's a very pricey place for subpar food. 

Would I go back? I don't know. It wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I'm amazed by how many people have not had true Southern food in this town. This makes me a little bit sad. 

Something should have told me that hipster-made 'Southern-style food' is probably not going to be the best thing in the world. For the price, I held out hope. 

Yeahh...no. 

The chicken was hot and while the meat was juicy, the skin consisted of way too much hot seasoning and not enough salt. 

So they claim to make 'Dirty Rice' - that's cute. Their dirty rice is much closer to Jambalaya as opposed to legit Dirty Rice. It too - could stand to have a bit more salt. A whole lot of cayenne/cajun seasoning does not 'dirty rice' make. 

Because I really tend towards masochism at times - and God knows I did that day - I got their Collard Greens. I should have known that this would be bad when the waitress described collards as 'bitter'. Collard greens are not 'bitter'. Turnip Greens are bitter. When she further told me that they cook their collards in Soy Sauce, I nearly spit my food out. 

The best thing about this experience, however, is their pie. 

So, heads up - if you are okay with a poor, shabby imitation of Southern Food, made with a hipster-style blandness and lack of knowledge about Southern cuisine, and if you're willing to pay top dollar for that sad experience, this is your place. But, if you want truly fantastic Southern-inspired food that will make you lick your plate - you would be better off going to Black Dog."}
{"text":"The food there itself was good, but the service however was not. Our waiter did not seem to enjoy his job, which is understandable, but at the same time as paying guests, we deserve at least a better attitude. At the end of our meal, the waiter didn't even want to walk around the table to hand over my check, causing him to spill beer all over my pants & purse. I would have thought he would offer something to make up for now me smelling like beer the rest of the night, but he did not however. Unfortunately, that ruined my experience at Watsons."}
{"text":"Being from Georgia I am a huge fan of fried chicken and all the fixings. That being said, I had huge expectations going into the restaurant. Unfortunately, I don't think this place met my expectations. The fried chicken was flavorless, burnt, and a little pricey. In addition, most dishes don't come with sides. You have to order them a la carte, which can add up quickly as they are $3.50 each. So, an order of chicken and a few sides will likely set you back $15 or more. Craziness! On the bright side, their biscuits,while small, are super tasty as is their peach tea. My overall suggestion for management would be to adjust the flavor on their fried chicken and lower the prices of the sides, or at least include one side with their dishes."}
{"text":"We were seated upon arrival and the service was great. The ambiance and decor were wonderful. These are the items we ordered and our experiences:

1) Gravy fries - The large potato wedges were crisp and hot out of the fryer. Unfortunately they were overcooked as they were not golden brown but rather very dark brown, and nearly burnt in flavor. We also received barely any gravy and few cheese curds. The little gravy we had was extremely bland.

2) Half bird, fried - The chicken obviously did not come out freshly fried, just warm. The breading was light and needed more seasoning. As for the meat, it was tender, but not juicy and also very bland. However, we had two sauces that were good: house hot sauce and the Alabama white, which we liked the best out of the two.

3) Pimento mac + cheese - This was perhaps the most disappointing dish we ordered. It was NOT cheesy whatsoever. We literally received plain, DRY (no cheese sauce) and flavorless macaroni.

4) Wok-fried dirty rice - We ordered this since it sounded so unique. We were sorely disappointed. It was dry, flavorless rice that had small bits of bland meat.

Overall, we greatly enjoyed the excellent service, but the food left us extremely disappointed and was not worth the amount we paid."}
{"text":"I've been to Watson's several times over the past year, and I want to add that the smoked gouda mac & cheese side is the best side I've had!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Fan-Fucking-Tastic 
Did i mention their food is Fan-Fucking-Tastic ?
truthfully best God Damn fried chicken Period !
oh they have waffles too :)"}
{"text":"Food was decent, and drinks were okay, but the service was great. I'll probably be back to try the mac and cheese, but was disappointed in the lack of other \"soul food\" type options, especially considering this place claims to have soul food."}
{"text":"My SO and I came here for his birthday:

The Good:
-The chicken is very, very good. Honestly, it was the best fried chicken I have ever had. Their crab hush puppies are very good also. My SO loved his chicken and waffles, but I personally wasn't a fan of the syrup.

The Meh:
- This place is very crowded, and very narrow. Tables are cramped, and there was a wait for us to get into at 6:30 on a Friday. The wait wasn't long, but I can see how busy it could get, and a few couples chose not to wait for a table because of the 30-40 predicted wait times (we actually waited 10ish minutes).

The Bad:
- Honestly, I really disliked their pimento mac & cheese. It was very dry and the seasoning on top (paprika maybe?) made those bites even drier.
- The biscuits are disappointingly small for the steep $3.50 price.
- The food here is just too expensive for what it is. Is it very, very good fried chicken? Yes.    Would I pay $8 for two pieces without a side again? No.

Overall:
If your hankering for fried chicken cannot be silenced by high prices, order away, it's awesome fried chicken. Otherwise, it might be best to skip this place."}
{"text":"While in town for family I stayed at the Hyatt downtown and found this gem...great food and drinks but - the reason I'm giving them 5 stars is because of the staff. Over the course of 4 days every single interaction I had was stellar. Friendly, accommodating, flexible and two words kept repeating, 'no problem'. Thank you and can't wait to come back. Great t-shirts too! Go have some fun."}
{"text":"On first entering one of the newer places in town I must admit, I was expecting to be disappointed. The new restaurants opening up around town haven't exactly been impressing me and I didn't see why this place would do much better. I was excited to see something of a different style so I guess they had that going for them. 

Let me just get this out of the way and say this place is great. It's not too expensive, the food is pretty great, and the staff was actually really friendly. 

I went about two weeks ago on a Saturday night. The wait was about 90 minutes but the location was conveniently right next to the pig so we just went for a beer while we waited for our table. When we showed up they were still getting things ready but my friends and I decided that we'd just as well take the few empty seats up at the bar. We were greeted by a friendly and sharply dressed guy whose name and number I can't remember but I hope that they keep him around because he was pretty great to just be around (guy crush?). Started off by getting drinks, I ordered the sculpin the night away, and a half order of chicken wings. The drink was okay, nothing special, but it was what i expected. The chicken wings were rather tiny but the BBQ sauce they were tossed in must have had some sort of addictive drug in them because I couldn't stop eating them. My guy crush bartender then proceeded to tell me about a special appetizer they had going right now, a huge Delaware oyster, and I had to order it right away. I don't get the chance to have good oysters in central IL often so I try to take it when I get it. The oyster itself was great, if a little salty, but by that point I was buzzing off of the experience of the place, or maybe it was the drinks. Oh and speaking of drinks they had Casamigos tequila which I was pleasantly surprised to see. It's not the best but it's much better than paying ten dollars for a shot of patron. The bartender and I proceeded to talk about all of the places in downtown you could find good tequila (definite guy crush) and I ordered a shot of the reposado. 

For my entree I ordered the chicken and waffles which on the menu has some cute and clever name referencing some lady maybe named Jenny or Sally or something. It came with a leg and thigh of dark meat and a tasty waffle with butter and syrup with some greens thrown in. I don't really know what to write about my experience eating it because quite honestly it's pretty hazy. I think I was just caught in some sort of tequila fueled chicken and waffle ecstasy for about half an hour. Needless to say i remember it being great. REALLY great. 

Don't go here expecting anything fancy, and certainly don't go here expecting to get a table immediately if you come on a Friday or Saturday. Maybe go here expecting to be disappointed then waddle up to the bar and drink a little while stuffing your face with some decent eats. Maybe you'll find yourself in front of a sharp dressed tequila drinkin manly face oyster messiah that can hold your attention instead of some large TV screen with a game where they push a ball at a thing to win. Or maybe you won't. Who cares? I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Mmm.  Just what champaign needs.  Our group shared some fried chicken, roasted chicken sandwhich, tofu sandwich and some slaw and mac n cheese.  All was great with the mac n cheese had se spice to it.  The tofu was crisp and flavorful and not the usual handout for the vegetarian in the crowd.  I had the milk money orchard drink; which lengthened the wordiness of my review.

Prices are good for downtown and the TVs are out of the way behind the bar so you have the option of avoiding them.  Loved the decor and hand blown glass lighting."}
{"text":"Finally, a real fried chicken place in downtown Champaign. I ordered chicken tenders and my partner ordered the light meat platter. The chicken is worth the wait (well, maybe not the hour-long wait on Friday and Saturday nights)- it's juicy, and the breading on both tenders and fried chicken is fantastic. The potato wedges are also really good, and the barbecue sauce (a Cheerwine one) is interesting- in a good way! I was also impressed by the drink menu.

Still, the lack of texas toast (the meal came with a slice of bread which was... well, not great) and the sweet tea, which was not sweet enough hurt a bit. I don't think I'm going to order the tea again, and I'm more wary about trying the sandwich."}
{"text":"Amazing food, beautiful dining room and quality service.  Had the chickie sandwich couldn't be hapier"}
{"text":"We visited Watson's Shack & Rail for the first time. We ordered the chicken sandwich with twice-fried potato wedges and the spit-roasted half bird. I was disappointed with the chicken sandwich as it ended up being pulled chicken - the menu does not indicate that. I am not a fan of pulled chicken. I would not have ordered it had I known. I hope they will update the menu description. The spit-roasted half bird was delicious. And the potato wedges were wonderful. We did enjoy the adult slushies. We ordered a flight of slushies - it was fun and they were tasty. It is worth stopping in just for the slushies!"}
{"text":"They opened only three days ago. Our visit was a very good visit.
This is a gastropub so expect good food and good drinks. 
Both the roasted and fried chicken were excellent. The waffle with the chicken was good. Sides were good: mashed potatoes were creamy, tomato pudding was good too. The pickle appetizer was excellent (cucumbers, turnips and beets). 
Service was very attentive (our server was #40). The interior has character and the ceiling is stamped tin. I posted several photos of the food and interior."}
{"text":"Well, what a disappointment... 

Went here last night looking toward to something new, but sadly, the only thing original about this was the decorations! 

I had the \"White\" (2 pieces of white meat chicken, 1 sauce and a choice of toast, waffle or biscuit). 

The chicken is local, so keeping that in mind maybe the price ad size was worth it... but $8 for the small portion I got wasn't what I would call \"value\". I got the waffle... and it was really 1/4 of a waffle and slightly burnt at that. The toast... was actually a slice of cold bread... there to absorb grease I assume. -_- 

Our server was nice... bet very over attentive. Like really, calm down, we can here to eat... 

They were out of the drink we wanted to try... but we didn't order any thing but water (which was nearly straight tap). 

So we left hungry and frustrated that we spent over $25.00 or a half burnt waffle & chicken snack. 

So yeah, a 2 star \"Meh. I've experienced better\" is accurate."}
{"text":"The first time I tried this place, I was impressed with the great drinks and service. The food is definitely over priced for what you get, but since it says it's all local, that could explain why it's expensive. The second time I ate here was...awful. Our server was a young guy who was either ignoring us or just super spacey, we couldn't tell. I ordered the exact same drink and it was completely different! It tasted AWFUL. They made me a new drink, but still, how could the same cocktail be made so differently each time? The meal was fine, but when we ordered the Texas Sheet cake for dessert, we were disgusted. How you can mess up a simple sheet cake is beyond me, but they managed to do it."}
{"text":"Everytime I've been to Watson's, I've enjoyed my experience. That's actually saying something. Each time my food is perfectly prepared and comes out fast. Each time I've had expert service. Each time I've been able to get in and out quickly. The staff is very kind, understanding, and competent, that's a lovely thing, it seems like they have a more seasoned wait staff. The prices are extremely reasonable. (Especially for downtown these days) I like the Nashville Hot Chicken with the Comeback Sauce and a side of Collard Greens! I prefer going for dinner, but they do offer a late night menu as well."}
{"text":"We always have a great time at this place. The atmosphere is upbeat and casual, the food is always solid. It's not clear from their menu, but you can usually always substitute in the cut of chicken you want (e.g. - you can get 2-3 breast pieces for a small up charge if you prefer white meat). They have a nice array of sauce options. The gravy fries appetizer is a crowd favorite with our crew. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is the best fried chicken there is in Champaign, period. I've been here three times and have had a magnificent experience with every meal I've had. I've only tried their fried chicken and not yet their rotisserie chicken, but it is out of this world. The batter is not too flaky, yet at the same time is consistent with the amount of meat there is to the chicken. Their biscuits and jam are some of the best sides I have ever had. The flight of slushies available is a great way to sample every slush if you're indecisive about choosing one specific flavor. It is a little pricey, but the quality and amount of food you get is worth every cent. Great space and environment really immerses you into your meal, alongside with the friendly clientele. Head there if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"I've never ordered anything at Watson's that I didn't love.

Appetizers: Chicharones are a must. The flavors vary but right now they have cheese ones that are delicious. Fresh, crackling, flavorful goodness. The wings rock, too.

Entrees: Chelsea's Shameless Plea is chicken and waffles at their finest. The honey and greens are a nice touch. The chicken is moist and the breading isn't overpowering. Can't go wrong with any of the fried chicken options. Try a variety of sauces!

Desserts: Hopscotch provides the pie for Watson's. If you don't stuff yourself with chicken, definitely try a slice (or get one to go!).

Beverages: They generally have 5 or 6 beers on tap including a couple of local options (plus many canned craft beers). Adult slushies are a perfect summer drink!"}
{"text":"We sat outside on a nice day and didn't have to wait long for a table. I tried some of the slushes and they pretty good. Huge selection of bourbon and beer. Started with the crab hush puppies and fried green tomatoes, both were good. Wish they had the pimento cheese with something other than saltines and celery. The fried chicken was good for Champaign. 

The Mac and cheese wasn't spicy even with green chilies and the cheese grits needed more salt. The coleslaw and mini biscuits were a good side and worth a try. 

Suggestion to Watsons: make a grilled pimento cheese sandwich with fried chicken"}
{"text":"This place undoubtedly in my opinion has the best fried chicken in Champaign. It is slightly comparable to that of Gus' in Chicago in regards to the batter. Now I won't have to miss Gus' as much when I'm in Champaign. I love the sauces they have to offer, and the side I ordered to try was the biscuits and jam (amazing). I look forward to going there again tonight to order some different things with friends. Their beer tap selection is also pretty good!"}
{"text":"The Nashville hot IS HOT. Not spicy, HOT. If you come from an area that is known for hot BBQ, go ahead. Otherwise get it on the side. Drinks were great, chicken was cooked well, but the spice level was a little too high for a Nashville meal to be enjoyed. I would come back for something normal, great otherwise."}
{"text":"Watsons can be hit or miss, but overall I'm happy to have it as a dinner option downtown. No matter the type of chicken you get, or the kind of sauce, know it will be pretty good. The sandwiches can be okay, sometimes they have too much bread for the amount of meat.

Drinks are amazing! I love them all."}
{"text":"Well--just my luck. My second time here and you are out of so much. God bless our server. She keeps spinning it as you are between \"menus\". Not sure why you do not have a Chardonnay as a wine option???? Hummmm! 
And out of two wines on a list that consists of SIX wines. We ordered 1/2 bird fried. With five sides. Let's hold our breath and see what've gotten ourselves into. Oh-I loved the biscuits last time but tonight you are out OF THE JAM! Dirty rice, slaw, sweet potatoes, mashed and biscuits. Obviously our chicken had been held under a heat lamp. As well the sides. I don't expect you to make my mashed fresh but since fried chicken is one of your SPECIALTY items it should be fresh.  And what's up with the tiny little plates? Thanks guys, good luck-I will roll elsewhere. At least I got to eat my chicken tonight--unlike the first night."}
{"text":"Before I rail against this shack, I highlight a few of the positives. 

The Positives:
The fried chicken is delicious. The breading and crispiness of the fried chicken is really nice and it is done really well. Also, the Comeback sauce is really delicious. You can use the sauce for the fried chicken or the 'fries' (potato wedges) that you get with Nashville Hot Chicken, and it gives it a nice flavor. Finally, with the Nashville Hot Chicken, you get some pickles, which are really good.

The Negatives:
The gravy fries were pretty terrible. I really regretted ordering them and wish I ordered something else. While the cheese curds were sumptuous, the dish overall was just very dry and bland. There was very little to no gravy on the fries and curds to make it worthwhile. Check out my picture.

While the fried chicken was good, it just was not enough to warrant the price. Whether you get bird by the piece or the Nashville Hot Chicken, it is just not worth it. I think people buy into the hype because you're at a restaurant and you're supposed to get small amounts of really good food but at the end of the day Watson's is just good fast food fried chicken.

Overall:
I would definitely say to try the chicken once. Stay away from the gravy fries, or if you do order them, ask for an extra helping of gravy. I'm actually curious to go back and try the spit roasted to see if it is any better."}
{"text":"In town on a Friday night for a long work trip, I decided to check this place out for dinner. 

Being alone means you eat at the bar, and being alone, married and pregnant can suck. 

I was so happy to see a decent non-alchoholic drink offering... their \"peacemaker\" was phenomenal and perfect for a refreshing beverage on a hot night... and it gave me a fancy looking beverage while I ate at the bar 

Bartender Anne was delightful, and quickly let me know to check the menu becuase things have changed (and based on some die-hard fan reviews apparently this place is very different now). Luckily I had no clue what I was getting into!!!

The bar had a great displayed selection of quality bottles, from my vantage point I could see an excellent variety of tequilas, and whiskeys and bourbons.

Bonus points for offering a popcorn tofu Pop Boy sandwhich and a side of Vegan potato salad... I'm a straying vegetarian while pregnant, but I love seeing quality options that are a true standing dish, and not just a menu item minus the meat.

Their fried chicken sandwhich was far better than I ever expected it to be. I haven't had that good of a fried chicken sandwhich since I lived down South in Georgia. A lovely chance for some proper fried chicken, while still being in the midwest. 

Fries weren't hot or particularly great... But the sandwhich alone made this a 5 star experience. The really good drink helped, and it was nice having a bar tender who kept my water topped off on a hot day."}
{"text":"TL;DR (out of 5):
Watson's Shack & Rail is one of the newer establishments to grace Champaign, serving up a perplexing combination of the dynamic, expertly executed alongside wistfully disappointing classics.  While the decor and service excel in creating a homely welcome, the foundation of the restaurant (the food) resembles a sinkhole supported by a handful of titanium supports (weird, I know).  Would I return to Watson's? Sure, but it definitely won't be for the chicken.

Food: 2-5

Service: 4
Decor: 3

I think I came to Watson's about a month after it first opened with some friends.  We started with the crab hushpuppies and, after hearing exalting reviews of their frozen drinks and fried chicken, we each ordered some combination of fried/hot chicken and a different slushie.  The hushpuppies were delicious, although a bit dense, with a good amount of crab and comeback sauce to cut through the heaviness.  The drinks, on the other hand, were mediocre; each focused on a \"special\" ingredient (such as carrots, chocolate donuts, etc), but lacked a balance and subtleness.  I could still taste a kind of well-liquor bitterness at the end of each cocktail. Nonetheless, I still looked forward to the supposed highlight of the meal - the chicken! But the chicken itself wasn't all that great either.  Mine was under-seasoned and half-overcooked; to be honest, I think all the chicken needed was a pinch or two of salt.  The seasoning was apparent, but without the salt, all I tasted was some heat mixed with a kind of chalkiness.  Disappointing...

Over my next two trips, I tried some crackling (fried pig skin), hot chicken, and chicken and waffles.  What confused me was that the crackling was alarmingly salty, while the chicken was (again) under salted and lacking flavor.

Then, after hearing about a change of menu, I visited again (why do I do this to myself?).  a friend and I ordered some slushies, which were much better tasting - sweet, tangy, flavorful - and split an appetizer of crispy brussel sprouts.  They were amazing! Perfectly crispy without being charred, sitting atop a base of curry aioli that complimented the sprouts beautifully.  Similarly, the sides I ordered (coconut curry mashed potatoes and collared greens) were exquisite and innovative - the mash was creamy with a kick of heat and slight sweetness from the coconut, and the greens were tender but not mushy.  But yet again, the chicken was completely lacking in salt.  Why??  I just don't understand it.  Yes, I added salt from the table, but it's not the same.  Salt helps the seasoning/batter to flavor the chicken; it even helps a bit with making the chicken juicy.  But I don't like having to salt my own food or slather it in sauce to make it taste good. (And btw, I'm definitely not one of those people who eats food that's covered in salt. I just like my food with flavor.)

Anyways... Like I said, I would go back to Watson's, but for their sides and appetizers and drinks, not their chicken.  Or maybe I'll order the chicken with extra salt.

{"text":"This place served me BURNT crab hush puppies (change the grease!) and the fried chicken was flavorless and waaaay overpriced for the quality of food that you get. It was too damn cold inside of this joint. I will never eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another try with 3 friends and I'm sad to see that it's still beyond subpar. I had a chicken sandwich with some gumbo. 

Service: 3/5
Our server was friendly and we were seated quickly. Drinks came out That's where the nice things I have to say end. It took 45 minutes to get our food and it came out incomplete. My friend ordered a Mac and cheese and they forgot about it till well after we got food.

Food: 0/5
The chicken was dry, the gumbo was disgusting and the rice and vegetables in it were so clumpy that it was impossible to eat. The chicken was peeling away from it's dried skin. The chicken was small compared to the size of the buns. It was absolutely drowning in overpowering mayo.

Absolutely don't bother with this place. Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday evening, got seated promptly and had great service. Pimento cheese and a shrimp salsa for starters, Nashville Hot was exceptional! Great attention by the staff and well mixed cocktails!"}
{"text":"I would give it six stars if I could.  Bruch was DELICIOUS.  Just stupendous.  I got the Cali Girl (delicious multigrain toast, guacamole, sliced avocado, baby heirloom tomatoes, RAW corn kernels... yes, the corn was so incredible you could eat it raw... and fantastic chimmichurri sauce.  Wow.  My husband was BLOWN AWAY by his chilaquiles -- the staff were even kind enough to send us away with a little to go container of the salsa so that we can try to recreate a least a little of the magic at home.  Nice booze-free breakfast drink as well (cherry-lime) and great coffee.  We had just been to the Prairie Fruits Farm 100-Yard chef's dinner the night before, and this actually measured up as a great follow up.  We sat outside and it was lovely, but inside looks like fun too.  Who cares if we live in Chicago?  I could see this becoming a regular spot for us for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"I crave this chicken. Smaller portions and price and shorter hours keep me from 5th star. I love there Nashville and non Nashville chicken!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in the Midwest :) The gravy fries and pimento grilled cheese are my favorites. Super creative food and drink menu, with my favorite cocktail being the \"Watson's Wabbit:\" carrot juice, ginger simple syrup, lemon, gin, splash of sprite. They also have two alcoholic slushie drinks, a bourbon/sweet tea/ lemonade and a Moscow mule, which are both amazing. To top it all off, you can't beat the atmosphere, decorated with a hand blown glass owl that perches on an industrial-looking tree branch at the end of the bar. They will also serve as a venue with live musical performances throughout the weeks. 10/10 in my book, and a great addition to downtown Champaign. Support your local farms by eating at Watsons Shack & Rail!"}
{"text":"Update! 
I have been to Watson's twice since my initial visit and boy have things changed. This place is easily one of the highlights of downtown Champaign, and my new favorite place to get chicken.
Staff were knowledgeable and incredibly friendly. I asked for some recommendations and they were quick to point out some of the customer favorites.
I, of course, am partial to their wings and their chicken sandwich, but their regular chicken is amazing as well. I've had both their fried and spit-fire roasted chicken and both are incredible.
Well done Watson's, you've exceeded my expectations and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We had really been anticipating our first visit to Watson's, and it did not disappoint. I'm from the south, spent 22 years living in Nashville, and I was really excited to check out a place in town that serves a lot of wonderful southern-influenced foods. Everything was top-notch. The food was seriously wonderful; flavorful, beautifully cooked, and the portions were perfect. It's a great value for the price. Watson's food gave me tons of great nostalgia for home

We put our names in at 8pm on Friday, and were able to get a two-top about 20 min later. The food and drinks all came out promptly, the service was great. We started with drinks, I got the Sculpin' the night away, which is grapefruit IPA + grapefruit juice + tequila. For $11, I got a drink that lasted me the whole meal, was tasty, plenty boozy. Win! The food was just wonderful. Started with the crab hushpuppies. I've had plenty of dense, dry, overcooked hushpuppies, but these were the dream: light, fluffy, lots of flavorful crab, with a delicious sauce alongside. We split the Nashville hot chicken and the chicken & waffles for dinner. The hot chicken is not hot by Nashville standards, but it is definitely Midwestern spicy, and has a nice slow burn and tons of flavor. It's served atop white bread with tasty house-made pickles (as it should be!) and a few potato wedges. The chicken & waffles was just as wonderful, and a good meal for anyone who likes things on the sweet side. A full waffle, nice heaping helping of butter, syrup, and a crispy, moist chicken!

Some folks have commented on the portion of chicken. With both our entrees, we got a drumstick and a thigh. They are smaller sized than grocery store chicken; that's because the chicken is high-quality and locally sourced. The flavor is fabulous and it was ample food for the price ($11 and $15). 

We also tried two of the sides, the grits (special that night, and fabulous) and the mac & cheese, which was yummy as well!

We were stuffed, but talked ourselves into the key lime pie, which was amazing. Very strong, creamy lime filling, with a wonderfully crumbly crust. 

We will definitely be back. I was impressed with a place that make both pie and chicken this delicious!"}
{"text":"Watson's was amazing. We tried just about everything on the menu. Such a creative and well thought out (and well executed I might add) menu. The slushee drinks were tasty, of all of them we preferred the Moscow mule. The crab hush puppies were delicious, as was the pimento cheese. Cannot stress enough that the gumbo was out of this world! The bird by the piece was also delicious- you don't even have to bother with the sauces because the chicken is so good on its own! The only thing we were not totally crazy about was the pie, but in no way did it put a damper on our experience. 

And to those of you hating on the prices- you are crazy! The quality and experience of eating at Watson's is in no way comparable to Popeyes or KFC. Totally different game people."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Watson's! The restaurant itself is very cute and rustic; loved the vibe. The food was amazing, as well! I got the chicken and waffles and was very happy. While I probably would order just normal chicken next time, it's definitely worth the try. The syrup is delicious and goes great with the chicken. The butter was very good, but slightly overpowering. The slushie I ordered was delicious, though! But you better like bourbon if you're going to order it! Everyone left with happy bellies. I didn't think the prices were bad at all, but being that I'm used to Chicago prices, Watson's seemed completely reasonable for the quality of food. The one thing I did note was that the biscuits were TINY! My mom ordered some and I was shocked by how small they were! Great experience, though, and delicious food. Worth going back!"}
{"text":"Beautifully crisp chicken. Amazing atmosphere and live music. The chicken itself was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The breading has a hint of rosemary, which was unique. The mashed potatoes were just okay. The Kentucky Slush was delish. Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Recent work obligations have been bringing me to Champaign-Urbana for the past several months, and on my third (and most recent trip) -- I finally got in at Watson's Shack & Rail. Yep, the third time was the charm, and it was well worth the wait. 

I'm not sure if I should call Watson's Southern. I mean, it's fried chicken and sides like mac and cheese and collard greens... Whatever style you call it, I'm thrilled places like this have been popping up lately all over the Midwest. We have the beloved Hot Chicken Takeover back home in Columbus. And now CU has Watson's.

I'm a Louisiana-turned-Midwestern boy, so seeing the food of my people makes my heart super happy. It doesn't, however, make my stomach happy because I usually can't eat anything at places like this. As someone with a food allergy, I fully expected Watson's to be the type of place where I go with friends, have a drink, and look longingly at their delicious food. 

NOT THE CASE HERE. 

Watson's has delicious spit-fired roasted chicken, and they actually understand what gluten-free means. I had SO MANY CHOICES. I ended up with a half chicken, greens, and mashed sweet potatoes. Everything was wonderful! I swear I almost cried tears of absolute joy over this food. Add to that meal freshly-brewed iced tea and housemade dipping sauces (like hot honey and ranch) -- and I was in heaven. 

In addition to all this tasty food, Watson's also has stellar service and beautiful decor. Everyone we ran into was incredibly kind and helpful. Since this place is so busy ALL THE TIME, I kind of expected the staff to be snarky and careless, but that couldn't be further from the truth. And the interior is beautiful! I love restaurants that are the right balance of comfortable and pretty. 

If you're in CU, put this place on your list. It's such a great experience, and I promise it's worth any hassle or wait. I went on a random weeknight and got there pretty early -- there was no wait at all!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now. This is the most overrated place downtown. Service is meh. Food is meh. Drinks are meh. I don't get the hype. Maybe because no one else downtown has fried chicken? I don't know. And it's totally overpriced. Gave it a few tries because it was new. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I came in for their first lunch service.  Ordered the Nashville Hot Sandwich.  It delivered on all levels.  It was so hot that I was crying.   The bread was great!  The chicken was awesome!  The hot sauce obliterated my mouth.  It was the right amount of messy.  The fries were thick and crispy!!  So good.  I take off one star because, dammit, they should be open every day for lunch!!!!"}
{"text":"So it pains me to write this, because i've loved Watsons since they opened, but they have made obvious changes lately and they are NOT for the better...example

The Wings are now more \"jumbo style\", a definite step backwards

The Hot chicken, my favorite item is also different, the skin just sort of falls off, it doesn't even approach the flavor and crunch it used to have.

Whoever or whatever is responsible for these changes, they are not good and hopefully i can get your attention.  I don't know if i will go back, its that big of a disappointment now."}
{"text":"I love the entire brunch menu - it keeps us coming back almost every weekend. The breakfast sandwich is amazing, the drinks are creative (and the Bloody Mary mix is fantastic), and whenever they do a breakfast burrito or quesadilla special it's delicious as well. We plan to keep coming back for brunch as long as they keep offering - best brunch in town in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Chicken is off the hook! Bar service is speedy and friendly. They even have a bar tender that looks like Ronnie\"Sunshine\" Bass from Remember the Titans."}
{"text":"Oh, Watsons! This restaurant has become a regular spot for me as it is a perfect space for anything from dates to family dinners, business meeting to a night out with friends. Since opening recently, their menu continues to evolve and manages to both honor a more traditional southern cuisine and simultaneously be creative/innovative and unique. The Nashville hot - which is a favorite of ours - is consistently juicy and perfectly cooked within while being supremely spiced, crunchy & fried on the outside. Other favorites have been the crab hushpuppies, pork rinds, the sweet potato side, the pickle appetizer. the tofu popcorn poboy, and so many more. Everything they have on special you can count on being delicious. They clearly mark all vegetarian options. For desert, they offer pie slices made by local business Hopscotch, and I can confidently say I have had some of the most creative and delicious pie slices of my life at Watsons. AND, their alcohol selection is amazing. Do yourself a favor and go, whatever the occasion!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but not the best fried chicken I've had. They also have spit fire roasted chicken but who gets that when you can have fried chicken? :p I like their variety of dipping sauces and side dishes. The flight of slushies is recommended- it is a fun novelty. Their fried pork rinds and gravy fries are very good! I didn't like the fried green tomatoes, the batter and tomatoes were too thick. Watson's can get pretty crowded and noisy on Friday/Saturday nights."}
{"text":"It's very unfortunate to write this updated review. Whatever changes were made in the last year, have all been for the worse. I'm not sure if it's under new management or they went through some turnaround in the kitchen or what, but all the changes have been for the worse. 

Chicken doesn't have the same crunch and seems less consistent than it used to be. Also seems like the spice was replaced with pure heat. To top it all off the bartender we had seemed to not give one shit the last time we were there. \"Yeah, it's hot.\" I know that dickhead, but it's supposed to be edible. I didn't stay long enough to get his name but my guess is he no longer works there.

Loved it when it first opened, probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I've never eaten in the restaurant. I always order out since I'm not one to embrace downtown when it's busy. But I'd go far and long to eat poutine-- and this place has it under the guise of gravy fries! The chicken gravy is so good-- can't get enough of it. Their mashed taters and gravy and heavenly. The richest and creamiest mashed potatoes I've ever had. And then hands down the best fried chicken around, and with so many different sauces. What a great place to have in the area. Something different and exciting!!

I just wanted to add a note about how amazing their customer service is. I had ordered through OrderUp and Watson's had to call me about extra charges for things I had requested. The process of handling this was so smooth. When I got my order, some of the items were missing. I called Watson's and spoke to Rosemary. She was so apologetic and said she would take care of OrderUp to get the additional items sent to me. Rosemary called back because OrderUp wouldn't help with a delivery driver. She said that one of the kitchen guys would deliver it at no cost, no worries. This place is a hands down favorite in my book, especially now. To go above and beyond to value a customer like that-- I'm speechless. Way to go Watson's and please keep serving up the yummy deliciousness! You have 5 stars on every front in my book."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge chicken fan, but Watson's is awesome! Their cocktails are amazing (Watson's Wabbit & the frozen Moscow Mule are a must to try). Cool atmosphere & good service. The tofu po' boy is awesome, as well as the chicken & waffle, and the pie! Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"On 5/20/2017...
As the Kid & I wanted to try something new, we found this place. 
The atmosphere & service was very good. Food, not so much. In 45 years, I have never left a piece of fried chicken on the plate. The skin was like bark but without any flavor. It was overpriced and small. We just left it. OAN, the oysters and accoutrements were refreshing although tiny. (Not even close to @frontierchicago). Buffalo wings were tasty, but tiny also. The one saving grace was the collard greens. Needed no extra seasoning, Just suggesting they cut them up a bit so the bite isn't a huge leaf. The smashed potatoes with chicken gravy was ok. If we were on Tiny House, we would fit in. Size does matter...

{"text":"I experienced this place three different times over one weekend! And I don't regret it! My boyfriend and I ate at the bar twice (dinner Saturday and brunch Sunday) and we also enjoyed a few cocktails there Friday night. Everything was delicious but even more impressive was the professionalism and kindness of the staff. Everyone was attentive and helpful in making sure we had the best experience. The frozen cocktails were delicious, I may have enjoyed more than one over the weekend... the chicken and waffles for brunch was wonderful! I want to return to Champaign just to repeat that experience! They really aren't kidding about their fried chicken, it's flavorful and moist. After having been away from champaign for nearly six years, I was impressed that a restaurant of this caliber (and others like it) were changing the downtown foodie and drink scene of the town!"}
{"text":"To be quite frank, Watson's is the what the Colonel would like fried chicken to be and even more. Watson's selection of chicken (can either be roasted or fried), sides, and extensive drink list are why it is one of the foremost restaurants in downtown Champaign right now. 

I would recommend trying the bird by the piece so that you actually get the type of meat you would like (light or dark meat). You can also buy a whole bird which is wonderful for large crowds or just a very hungry person! Watson's is also vegan and gluten conscious!

You may be thinking, \"Why would I go to Watson's if I can go to KFC and get a huge bucket of chicken for next to nothing?\" The answer is... quality. Watson's does not specialize in being the cheapest fried chicken. It also does not specialize in being the first to fry a chicken. Watson's focuses on quality, of which you cannot beat."}
{"text":"Nashville look works well in down town champaign. 

Visited Watsons on a Saturday around 5:30, no wait for a table. Drink menu includes plenty of whiskey and craft beer. What stands out is they have adult slushies. The one I had was a Moscow mule slush ($6). 

The menu is mostly chicken and sides. Grilled or fried. Ordered the half bird with 2 sides. The menu says can feed 2-3 people. Well the 2 of us got through it and were still a little Hungry. 

However the food came out fast as hell, I'm talkin we ordered and in about 5 minutes hot food was in front of us.

The fried chicken was okay, not enough crunch for my liking. However the sauces were quite good. The sides we ordered were also above average for the prices. 

Overall the place has a cute gimmick, the location is solid, and the price is extremely fair. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to get a break from the almost very typical cuisine of central Illinois."}
{"text":"The fried chicken here is out of this world!  I got waffles and chicken with a side of potato wedges.  The chicken was crispy and decadent and waffle- chicken taste combination complemented each other.  Would definitely go back for more!
PS: I've heard the cocktails are good but didn't get an opportunity to try them.  Next time!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and its one of my favorite places to go downtown Champaign. Service is great, even if they are busy!"}
{"text":"I tried the Nashville hot chicken and a peach bourbon cocktail. The service was good and the food was fresh. I went around 5 o'clock so they weren't busy when I got there. By 6 o'clock there was a wait."}
{"text":"Being simple is not a virtue that I expect to the chicken&beer place.

I had Nashville hot chicken, what I was served was a hot chicken, but nothing more than that. I liked the degree it was cooked, crispness, hotness, and almost every other basic things you can imagine of. Surprisingly, however, there was nothing more than that. Somehow they made the chicken hot without any other spiciness that you would expect of (or was I nose-blind for that 30 minutes?). Similar things happened to the potato wedges and the pickles. Perfectly cooked but dull. Would I have a same feeling when I hear to a robot playing violin?"}
{"text":"Went there w/ gf on a Friday night. Didn't really wait around 5pm but people were already started filling up. Food is great. Had crab hushpuppies and a half bird, so good that we added another two pieces afterwards. Service is good, fried chicken were juicy and amazing especially when it's hot and just served. The place has a great vibe as well and will recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been there about 4-5 times now. The service is always great. The food is hot and yummy. The specials have always been good, in fact I think they have some of the best Fish and Chips in town. The oysters and crab hush puppies are very good, so much so that we can't bring ourselves to try different appetizers. Expect a wait for a table but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Chicken here is stellar! Wondeefully light and just the right salty goodness! Watson's Wabbit craft cocktail was unusual (featuring carrot juice) and delicious! Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Disappointment.  However, with more attention to detail this could be a 4-5 star place.  Visited for a late lunch on a Sunday and it took way to long to be seated.  The menu is interesting in selections offered.
The dining room is a bar on the south side and tables on the north side along with outside seating.  The dining room is for the most part a clean.  The décor is very interesting and adds to the local feel of the place.  The restrooms are spotless.
We had the chicken fried steak, eggs and potatoes.  Suggest that toast should be offered since the older crowd considers bread a staple for breakfast.  There should be an item that breaks the meal apart and refreshes.   Maybe even a slice of orange.
The meal was prepared perfectly and seasoned just right.   The meal  is a lot of food.   A 1/2 order could be a solution for the lighter diner.  Just a lot of food.
The server was average and friendly.
A nice place for downtown that needs just a few adjustments."}
{"text":"The food is good. The prices for those portions, not. We liked the non-oily, delicately textured fried chicken, the mildly spiced collard greens with smoked turkey, and the light sweetness of the baguette with rhubarb & cottage cheese. The mashed tots with the chicken gravy were okay. The Devil's Dream was a lovely light drink, perfect for the sunny day and the dishes we ordered, and I'll be back to try the Howling Owl. It's a good place to try out, but I don't see myself as a regular here."}
{"text":"Before my trip here, I did a quick Yelp search for places to eat near my hotel and bookmarked Watson's Shack & Rail based on the pretty fried chicken pics.  It also happens to be directly next door to the hotel, which made visiting this place a no brainer.  Especially considering the fact that the high temperature for today was well below freezing so proximity was of the utmost importance.

The chicken comes fried or spit roasted - tough choice to be sure.  On this night I went with fried with \"Alabama White\" sauce and stewed collards.  The sauce is basically a vinegary mayo that goes pretty well with the fried chicken.  The chicken on its own was great and the collard greens were the perfect side.  If I were here another night I'd definitely be back to sample their spit roast chicken.  Just another reason to come back."}
{"text":"Solidly four stars.

First the good: The chicken is excellent; my girlfriend and I loved it. The gravy fries starter was also really fantastic.

Now for the bad: each biscuit is approximately the size of a thimble and it costs $3.50 for two of them. For $3.50 I should get thimble-sized biscuits for life."}
{"text":"Why did the chicken cross the road?  To get fried up for dinner!  Ha... ha?

No wonder the Hyatt's gym smelled of juicy, crisp fried chicken that one night... Yep, Watson's is the newest kid on the block and is frying up loads of chicken for all your taste buds out there!  I tried the 2 piece meal that came with a breast and leg and enjoyed the crispiness of the skin (the best part!) and the juiciness of the chicken. Honey sauce on the side had a kick to it.  For my side, I tried the dirty rice, which had andouille sausage in it, but it fell a little flat for me. 

Watson's has plenty of beer choices and cocktails too.  I tried the housemade lemonade and was pleasantly surprised it wasn't overly sweet.  The sweetener used reminded me of agave.  

Final random notes: service was a little on the slow side.  Check out the unique decor.  Also look up at the ceiling: it's gold plated!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants in Champaign and we frequent it regularly! It is a great place to bring visiting guests from out of town or to have an evening with friends. It is a fine-casual restaurant with a great local feel.

We would recommend bird by the piece with a biscuit & jam and mashed potatoes for sides, the chicken and waffles, and the fried chicken or nashville hot sandwich. The adult slushies, Daisy Buchanan cocktail, and Unclouded Day cocktail are also excellent. We love everything as much as the first time we tried it - which was many times ago!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Owner talked with us. Loved that chicken was free range from an Amish farm nearby. Food was tasty. Nice portion size. Good value. We'd go there again."}
{"text":"I'm just going to say, if you're reading this hoping for a food or drink review, I don't have much to say. But the bathrooms here are so nice!!! They have tampons and lotion. 

Real talk: lots of variety of drinks. Very extensive bar. Lots of interesting sounding mixed-slushee-drinks."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I chose to go to Watson's while in town. Vegetarians (and all) - the fried tofu Po'Boy does not disappoint. One of the best veg sandwiches I've had - original & delicious. Great bourbon selection & helpful, friendly staff. Environment is cool and laid back. Good TVs @ the bar if you're interested in catching a game. Good work Watson's Shack & Rail."}
{"text":"Watson's offers a Midwestern riff on Southern comfort food.

On the rail, their drinks menu is vast. Their selection of Slushies are like the grown-up & much more sophisticated version of the 7-11 classic. I tried the Kentucky Slush ($6, oj, peach sweet tea, Fighting Cock Bourbon, lemonade, Sprite, garnished with a sliver of orange & cherry). For a non-alcoholic selection, their homemade lemonade ($2.75) is fantastic as well. You think you're getting lemonade but there's a refreshing hint of mint in there that really brings it up a notch.

If you want chicken done right, this is the place. This shack offers chicken & waffles under a different name: Chelsea's Shameless Plea ($14). Crisp, fluffy waffles with some addictive concoction of maple praline syrup comes with 2 pieces of perfectly seasoned, fried chicken and collard greens. As if that wasn't enough, I also ordered the Dark (bird by the piece) spit-fire roasted chicken ($8) with a side of green chile mac n cheese ($3). Delish!

On hot days like these, stop by Watson's where the air conditioning is strong, the service is friendly, the drinks are plenty, and the food is good."}
{"text":"Wow. Outstanding. Our daughter is a freshman and we have tried most of the restaurants in the area.  Watson's gets it.  Great food, service and atmosphere.  We have at least three more years of coming down to Champaign and Watson's will be our go to restaurant.  Can't wait for our next visit."}
{"text":"Obviously opinions are based on personal preference and so in many ways, these reviews are all subjective. I'm just going to say it right away, I came to this place for their FRIED CHICKEN ONLY! I heard it was exceptional and since I'm a FRIED CHICKEN WHORE, it was a must that I try this downtown Champaign eatery. Keeping that in mind, I shall offer the opinion that suits the numerous experiences I've had consuming fried chicken over the years. My order came with a breast of chicken ($9) and a drumstick (a substitute for the wing that the order originally came with for an additional $2).Right off the bat, it's some of the most expensive fried chicken I've eaten anywhere, based on portion size and style of the restaurant. Since I was staying at the hotel next door,  I decided to take my order to go. Upon opening the box, I had to laugh when I saw the minuscule size of the $9 piece of chicken breast (see photo). I also had to look out the window of my hotel room for the Empire State Building because for a minute I thought I may be in the Big Apple the prices are so high! Okay, so once you get over the fact that your wallet has been raped and pillaged, you immediately hope for redemption in the form of exquisite and savory chicken (even if it is a morsel. Unfortunately, this was not going to be the experience I was hoping for. The chicken was dry and the coating was lackluster in spices and flavor. I've had much better from my local grocery store deli department. I will say this though, the staff were friendly and the ambiance was really cool with ornate ceilings and low lighting. I should have stayed for a beer or two or three , since they have a decent bar there. Maybe I wouldn't have noticed the mediocre fried chicken if I had a little buzz going on! Since the establishment is apparently a little over a year old, I'll wish them luck nonetheless."}
{"text":"Food was okay, ordered chicken and waffles. The waffle was cold where the butter did not melt and slightly burnt They offered to replace the waffle, but it would have required additional wait time. Service was okay, had to ask for silverware and water. My second time visiting with similar experiences."}
{"text":"This was my first time and I was very impressed. I got the jerk chicken burrito special but since I can't have wheat they were EXTREMELY accommodating and made me the equivalent as tacos and they were amazing. I also got to try someone twice fried potato wedges and wow those were good. Can't wait to take my husband back for the Nashville hot!"}
{"text":"Found the place on Yelp and decided to pop in and see what it was all about. Ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken and was very impressed. Nice breading, crunchy and just the right thickness. The chicken was super juicy. The spice is just the right balance of mouth on fire and smokey. And talk about pickle slices... They are huge and so good! Make sure you keep your water glass handy when you order it and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Watson's is simply awesome. Incredible southern style food, mostly based around their chicken. My favorite main dish is the gravy fries with chicken, which has twice fried potato wedges, cheese curds, and well... chicken. They also have rotating \"adult slushees\" that are usually great. They once prepared one using Curtis Orchard's apple cider and topped it with an apple doughnut. Their brunch may actually be my personal favorite in all of champaign. They have an incredible shawarma brunch dish that I highly recommend, and their poutine is phenomenal as well. You can tell they place a lot of attention into their food quality and the ambiance has an open, social feel to it. One of my top 3 spots in CU."}
{"text":"We love Watson's! Everything is great- from the chicken and sides to the boozy slushies- we have always had a great time. Be careful, the Nashville Hot sauce has varied in heat level and can be soooo hot. When it's just the two of us, we like to sit at the bar, but when we've come with groups of 6+ the wait is never more than an hour. They text you, too, so you can go to another bar until your table is ready if it's packed. It's a great little gem in downtown!"}
{"text":"This place has quality food and drinks at the right price! I had the rotisserie chicken sandwich and the slushie flight, highly recommend both! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. The Nashville Fried Chicken sandwhich was excellent. Also had a flight of the boozy slushies and they were fun and delicious."}
{"text":"Fav place in town! Consistently exceeds expectations. Great service and amazing food. The drinks are also top notch. It has such an eclectic vibe you can be fancy can casual or in between! 10/10!!"}
{"text":"I don't eat meat and even I had one of the tastiest meals I've had in a long time! They have a delicious vegan po'boy with fried tofu, mixed greens and a spicy vegan mayo remoulade. My boyfriend tries something new every time, he never knew how much he liked chicken and waffles until we went to Watsons! Did I mention the tasty, unique cocktails? Because they are very creative and never disappoint."}
{"text":"A lot of their food is locally sourced and I love that! One of the only places in town you can get fresh oysters too. Best fried chicken in town and their late night food is the perfect midnight snack, always."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I am a Super Fan of this place! From start to finish no awkward moments where folks I eat dinner with have to say \"I think there is something here for you.\" Nope. This place is very clear. Wanna eat GF? Wanna eat Vegan? Wanna eat meat? Order up! I normally am not a big fan of vegan food when it is my only option, as it can be dry and dull. But heck when the Popcorn Tofu Po'Boy (remoulade, lettuce, red onion & pickle) showed up and looked like everyone else's meals and tasted OUT OF THIS WORLD good stuff, I was sold. The 'pickled' sampler was great and I had a mighty fine Daisy Buchanan and drank her right-up. The reservation system was lovely. We got drinks at a nearby bar and just waited until our table was ready before heading back. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I had the Nashville chicken (spit roasted instead of fried) and mac n cheese. The spit roasted chicken was a bit dry, but the skin on the fried chicken that my friend ordered seemed to easily separate from the meat - which is unfortunate because we were told this place had good fried chicken. The mac n cheese was slightly bland, but otherwise good. Overall, just stick with the spit roasted chicken and expect slow service (30+ minutes for food) when it's busy."}
{"text":"My husband and I have enjoyed this restaurant many times since opening, from date nights to bachelorette parties to family dinners with my picky parents. Each time has been filled with quirky, delicious dishes from the well-curated menu, tasty drinks to wash it down, and a slice of pie from the talented Hopscotch housed at Art Mart. Rosemary, Emily, and other FOH staff do a wonderful job at providing low key but attentive service, even to this picky, former fine-dining server. In a town full of critical foodies, Watsons has sailed through typical new restaurant kinks to become a favorite choice. Keep doin what you're doin."}
{"text":"Been here twice, service is always great and the food tastes great. The first time we visited, they were out of two things we wanted to order which was super disappointing."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch on a Friday. Super modern yet comfy space. We went in craving fried chicken and found that their lunch menu only offered it in sandwich form. Our disappointment was brief because the sandwiches were awesome! We especially loved the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. The fries were well-seasoned and a great proportion to the sandwich. It was a great meal size and the sandwiches were awesome! As a bonus, they have a large selection of whiskey and bourbon if that's something you're into."}
{"text":"Watson's certainly provides the finest fried chicken in Champaign, no doubt about that! I wound up here for lunch on a Friday between checking out of my hotel and having to head to CMI airport. Grabbing a table all by myself, suitcase in tow, was no trouble at all. I ordered the Fall Bounty salad with some Nashville fried chicken (oh yeah), as well as a pint of a pale ale by Chicago's Revolution Brewing. The table was large enough to contain my laptop, which was convenient since I had to get some work done.

My beer arrived first, and the food followed shortly thereafter. Both were excellent choices indeed. I loved that the Nashville fried chicken was actually spicy--I have been underwhelmed more times than I care to share. It also paired very well with the pecans and butternut squash in the salad!

I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Champaign, and I'll try to make it out for the (more extensive) dinner menu."}
{"text":"I wanted some late night food, so we came here around 11:30pm and ordered the tofu, hush puppies, and chicken wings. All things were delicious! 

Although I was not in the mood for loud music and wanted a chill place to eat, I was pleasantly surprised at the talent performing. The band was playing hits from early 2000s, all my favorite songs. 

I wish I had ordered one of their blended drinks for $6, so I will next time."}
{"text":"The fried wings were pretty average. Not a bad snack before dinner. My most expected Kentucky slush and cocktails were disappointing. every cocktail had too much alcohol. Wait, is that a bad thing or good thing? Lol. Anyway, I personally don't like those cocktails"}
{"text":"Fried chicken and waffles with hot honey!!! WOW!!!!
It's the best meal I've had in a long time. I will be going here every chance I get. Seated quickly and fast drinks. Went here before Blake Shelton concert. Was packed and still got in fast. Great food, great service and friendly people. Do yourself a favor and try the chicken and waffles"}
{"text":"Very good cocktail-had a mule.  Ordered the Chelsea.  Chicken is very small but delicious.  Waffle was amazing.  Did not get the greens or apple butter that was to come with order.  After asking was told they were out.  That irritated me.  I will give it another try but will order half a chicken. This was on a Tuesday night at 6:30 so they should have not been out of anything or at least told me.  I had a waitress and a trainee and one of them should have said something."}
{"text":"Excellent Nashville Hot Chicken. Although it is definitely as close to the highest price you can charge for fried chicken, it is very good and rivals any restaurant in downtown. Although I haven't had it all my friends and family love the Mule to go along with their food. Plus, who doesn't love their homemade sides and pies!"}
{"text":"Don't really understand the complaining about high prices here. The fried chicken is awesome. They can charge more because they use high quality chicken and do it right! Food was really good. Just what I had expected. The shrimp michelada was awesome too. They have a roasted apple cider that tasted like a French apple tart. Amazing! All in all a great place. Great value and the service was superb. Keep up the good work fellas"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. It's in a great location in a cool building in the heart of downtown Champaign. It was recommended to me by friends so we tried it out once the early crush of new diners had died down a bit. It still took about an hour wait on a Friday to get a table but I won't complain about that. But although the food quality was solid, I didn't find it special.

The chicken we ordered was cooked to the proper doneness, but the breading seemed a bit soggy. I liked the big steak fries but the chicken just wasn't exceptional. Perhaps I've been spoiled by White Fence Farm in the Chicago area, but I thought the breading should have a bit more seasoning and a more crispy texture. Side dishes were decent but went no further.  Overall, I thought the food was good enough to rate a return visit but again, it just did not wow me."}
{"text":"Had a chicken sandwich for lunch, thigh meat, which I prefer. This however was under cooked (read chewy). Needed about another two minutes on each side. Kitchen better get it together for the prices."}
{"text":"Love the environment here, the food, staff and the boozy slushees are top of the line. Fried chicken is so fresh and juicy! Very cool place."}
{"text":"I love the fried chicken here but mine is kinda burnt. But I like that they can give me chicken gravy even though it's not included in types of sauces that I can choose from."}
{"text":"Very good food. Chicken is delicious and so is everything else. Service is quick and courteous. Could use a few more beers on tap but mixed drinks are good."}
{"text":"A long bar, long narrow dinning area, all wood.  A cozy, and very close spot that has a lot of charm in downtown Champaign. With a menu of chicken and other southern sides and dishes.  I have not been able to check this spot out until now, the last time I was in town there was a line to get in and every seat was packed.  I was able to make a visit during the holidays, when the town is mostly empty.

Anyway, we were seated right away with drink orders placed and received quickly.  My parents and I went with the full bird, for $28.  Four sides and four sauces, this feeds at least 3 very hungry people easily.  Food is made to order, but kitchen times are still pretty quick.  The fried chicken is really well made.  It comes out piping hot, crispy, juicy, flavorful.  I did not need any sauces, though those were tasty and put to good use regardless.  Caesar salad is good, as is the chicken and oyster gumbo.  The gumbo had good spice, and nice chunks of chicken.  It could have used more oysters IMO.  The sides are hit and miss.  Good collard greens, average mac and cheese, good mashed taters, average black eyed peas.  All in all, a lot of food that is well priced, and well made and really enjoyable.

A full bar, lots of beer in bottles and cans.  They could do a better tap list.  It seems loaded with either macros or heavy IPA's and Stouts.  Nothing in between.  That could be rounded out better, but a small gripe.  Good bourbon, and even some unique gins on the list.  

Good food, full bar, good service and atmosphere that really fits in with downtown Champaign.  I'm a fan and will be coming back when I get a chance."}
{"text":"Really fun place. I recommend the tofu po'boy sandwich, the drinks (really liked the Daisy Buchanan), and the biscuits with jam. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Fun and funky. 
My wife had the Nashville Hot chicken. We've never had genuine Nashville hot to compare it to, but it's definitely better than the versions of it we've had at home in Dayton OH. I got the basic fried white-meat chicken, with black pepper ranch sauce. Really good chicken ... juicy without being greasy. I had the smoked gouda mac & cheese side with mine, and that was VERY impressive. We both had their adult slushies to drink with our meal, and those were fun and paired better than expected with the chicken."}
{"text":"There is definitely a rave going on about this place, so I dropped by one night out of curiosity. The food was by all means decent. I had a dark meat, fried. The meat was seasoned well and their sauces were great - the comeback sauce!

If you like crispy (slightly overcooked) and thin crusts, it is your thing. For me, it was a tad bit dry."}
{"text":"The food was good, it all depends on what you order and when. I had tried many items on many different days. I found it over priced and over cooked amazing local ingredients. Being from the south it's an ok Midwest version of southern cooking.the staff is great, atmosphere great and concept great, but I would have rather gone to SAMs club and buy a rotisserie for $4.95."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend because I thought it was pretty \"ballsy\" for a place to serve mainly fried chicken. The atmosphere screams hipster all the way down to the cutesy menu, but the decor is nice and it is clean.  The servers are also straight out of Bucktown/Wicker Park (you pick) along with their attitudes, tattoos, piercings and beards. The server was attentively inattentive.  She checked on us at least 4 times once dinner was served, but not once refilled the water. 

The crab hushpuppies were delightful and I would likely order again. The fried chicken left much to be desired.  I understand that I ordered the \"light\" and white meat tends to be on the dryer side, but the breast was dry.  The breading seems to need a bit more seasoning and is possibly very good when fresh out of the frier.  However, I felt that my chicken may have sat in the back for a minute or under a heat lamp before arriving to the table.  Sweet potatoes were very good and my friend appeared to enjoy her chicken tacos. 

I would probably give their chicken one more chance before writing them off completely. 

Long story short, if they are priding themselves on fried chicken, I've had better."}
{"text":"Watson's exceeded my expectations. Same space as the old Boltini but it looks more open and spacious. I had the rotisserie sandwich $7 plus soup (gumbo) $3 plus mashed potatoes with chicken gravy ($3.50). All awesome and I normally don't like gravy. I also liked the draft selection, had Stone and Dogfish Head drafts for reasonable $5 each. My wife had the light portion of the fried chicken $8 and twice fried wedges $3 with hot honey. That sauce had a nice kick, look forward to trying others next time. Wait was only about 10 mins at 7 pm on a Wednesday, staff very friendly and food came out fast."}
{"text":"I'll start my review by sending a shout out to Boltini which I loved like a cousin twice removed. RIP 

Anyway, the smells of Watson's set me up for a glorious chicken experience with country sides that I can count on. However, I did not have those sweet Dreams fulfilled. I'll admit that I came on an odd day, Superbowl Sunday, but I think that shouldn't change the overall ambiance and service at a restaurant, especially one that just opened. The main menu was no longer being served so I settled for a \"cocktail\" and an appetizer. I ordered the Milk Money, which translates to a slightly liquored chocolate milk drink, but only with the last dregs of chocolate in the syrup bottle. I was hoping they made the donut that comes with the drink, but this was an Etenmann's donut on the straw. Again, not bad but I wasn't blown away. I tried the crab hush puppies but still did not get the flavors as described in the menu. This was a decent hush puppy but had neither flavor nor crab. The food was hot and the comeback sauce wasn't bad.

As for service, I cut some slack because this was a holiday of sorts but I felt pretty ignored sitting at the bar. Trying to hail a bartender with my eyes and hand didn't really work. When they did come over, it was perfectly adequate service. Again, not blown away.

I have every intention to return  for the actual chicken menu and challenge them for an actual cocktail that doesn't have a pastry hanging off of it. Be ready for an update. Until then, I'll just fry these wings at home and avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"If there's a cohesive vision, it's not evident.

The emphasis is on the chicken, which is incredibly greasy, next to vegan and gluten-free offerings. 

The decor is rustic, unless you include the window sill that doubles as an overflow pantry shelf.

It feels like it was created with a checklist of what's trendy, all anchored by mediocre food, and seemed to miss the mark.

I'd been there once before and got the fried chicken (the signature focus of the restaurant.) It was underwhelming - the flavor was okay, but it was so greasy that each swallow was unpleasant. This second time, I tried the gumbo. It was actually kind of good, but not worth making the trip.

I think I'm done. Some people seem to love it, but it's not for me."}
{"text":"Tried it out the other day, to see what all the hype is about.   Started with the oysters which were really good but pricey.    Had seats at the bar, was told it would be about 30 minute wait, this was about 4:30pm  on a Sat.  We ended up eating at the bar, instead of waiting for a table to open.   Drinks were good, ordered fries with gravy and the hush puppy crab cakes for apps.  The fries were ok, didn't have near enough gravy though.  The hush puppy crab cakes were fantastic.  The chicken came it was delicious also.  The sides left something to be desired.  The mac and cheese was definitely disappointing.   The biscuits were not as fresh as I expected.  Overall the food and atmosphere were good, but I can only give them 3 stars because of the prices and the sides.  If you got a great product but fail to compliment it,  you lack the complete package.  I will probably go again, but won't be somewhere I go often."}
{"text":"Service, food, drinks all awesome. My new favorite place in town. The peach iced tea is amazing."}
{"text":"I was in Watson's this past Friday before the San Fermin concert at the Accord. I had the Nashville Hot Chicken, both me and my husband, and it was completely revolutionary of the way chicken meat can be prepared! I uploaded a close-up of the teared out chicken meat which you could take a peek yourself but you will regret it if you don't get yourself one. The crust was little dark to over-fried, when it was teared open, the pink, soft, succulent meat was revealed, splashing the juice it contained. I guaranteed you it is a nonfiction, go figure!

Side note, San Fermin is a really really cool band! The stage chemistry is both cool and hot! Check it out too!"}
{"text":"Great location and beer selection. Love that they have a vegan po boy option, it's delicious! I would come back here."}
{"text":"It was good. Service was wonderful. 

We got the roasted and fried chicken and both were solid and good."}
{"text":"On first glance of the menu, I was pleasantly surprised that they have a really great selection of small plates and unique cocktails made from homemade ingredients. This would be a great place to come for some late night snacks and cocktails.

They were out of the spit roasted chicken tonight so we opted for fried chicken. I went with the Chelsea. It was certainly the best chicken and waffles I've ever had.  I couldn't believe how ridiculously moist the chicken was. The breading was light and crisp and not the salty doughy mess that you expect from fast food chains. I also had the Watson Wabbit cocktail which was sweet and savory and delicious. Pate was on special and I couldn't turn that down. It was served with toasted Pekara bread and had little green onion garnish and raisins - so yummy! We can't wait to come back and try more stuff!"}
{"text":"Meh.  Over priced mediocre chicken.  
I ordered the 2 piece dark meat chicken with a side.  When it came out I was rather disappointed with the small portion size.  The chicken pieces were small, as well as the side.
The chicken wasnt bad, but it wasnt great either.  Certainly not worth the price for what your getting. 
I also ordered an IPA which was $6 that was brought to me in a can. Geesh... really???
The IPA was good, but not worth six bucks.
My opinion of this place, is that of a bar that serves chicken.  I would not consider it a restaurant that specializes in chicken. 
Im tempted to give this place 2 stars, but I'll give it 3 since the food wasn't bad.  Just not a good value for the price."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - Couple friendly, was a little loud: 4 stars. Drinks - Interesting beer list and drink selection, 5 stars. Meal - I had Nashville chicken, not a flavor I enjoyed & biscuits were very disappointing; Others with me enjoy their meal: 3 stars. Dinner for 3, 1 round drinks: $72 + tip. Worth giving a try!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a no star I would. So looking forward to eating here but we sat at the bar and for 15 minutes were totally ignored as the bartender visited with his goober friends who were not even drinking. Never once were we acknowledged. We got up and left and my husband said thank you twice and still wasn't acknowledged. We exited then my husband went back in and asked are y'all open and said yes and then my husband left. We travel for work all over the country and have never been treated so poorly. Shame on you as an establishment."}
{"text":"I consider myself some kind of coleslaw connoisseur - and Watsons coleslaw is a perfect match to their chicken. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I love Watson's! Literally came here twice in a row. The food and drinks are so good!!! We got the slushie flight and the half bird. We got the gravy and hot honey as the sauces. It was delicious!!!!! They also have a lot of hot sauces on a shelf that you can have with your food. Soooo great. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Consistently good service and food. Especially good service experiences from Ian and Julio! I always have a great time visiting this bar and I suggest to everyone!"}
{"text":"Before Edison invented the light bulb, what did people say when they thought of something great? \"It was like the candle got lit\"? That just sounds stupid. 
The invention of the light bulb was a game changer in the history of mankind. 
Every Saturday at midnight Watson's has a late night burger, usually it's what I get. Last nights had french toast for a bun, had some strawberry jam, and was dusted with powdered sugar. I don't really like sweets, so that wasn't for me. (The people who ate it loved it). 
On the late night regular menu, there is a Nashville Hot sandwich, so I was going to get that and add bacon to it. But then the bartender was like, \"it's not on the late night menu, but we've got all the ingredients on the menu to make a Du Velo.\". So I'm like, what's that... Nashville hot chicken, cheese, pork belly, herb mayo, and fried egg. And I'm like \"HOW HAVE I NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE!!!???\" \"How do you want your egg?\" Over-easy. 
Sandwich comes out, put the top bun on it, give it a squeeze, egg yolk shoots all over the potato wedges. Take a bite, and it's just as perfect as it sounds. Two huge chunks of pork belly, the egg, the spicy chicken (heck, you hardly notice the chicken, but it's there and compliments the rest of the sandwich perfectly). 
This has changed my life. 
It's available every late night and during the day, so, if you don't know what you want, get the Du Velo. 
It will become as important to your life as light bulbs."}
{"text":"So many times I have craved for fried chicken but somehow never stumbled upon this restaurant. Today was the first time I went here, and I was so angry at myself for not coming here early. It's a nice cosy restaurant. Thankfully, we were seated immediately and did not have to wait as I was really hungry. I had already decided on what to order, so immediately ordered lemonade, soup (Kinda chicken gumbo) and Nashville hot chicken for myself and daisy Buchanan and spit fire roasted dark chicken for my husband. 
Nashville hot chicken was everything I was looking for.. Crispy, hot, juicy, yum. Lemonade had a hint of mint and tasted good. Soup was light and tasty. My husband loved his drink and chicken. All in all, a good meal. Our server was really nice, when she came to know it's our first visit, she told us about the restaurant and how they use local produce. She also explained the spice level of different sauces  to my husband patiently. Loved it."}
{"text":"The food tastes really really good. They have fresh oysters! Can you believe that? Lol but their fried chicken came out black. That's why it's a 4 star."}
{"text":"This would be 5 stars if they could bring the cost down just a little. This may have 2 $'s but it's on the high end of 2 $'s... and I'm not a poor. 

The portion sizes are great so you don't feel like a total lardo after eating a meal comprised primarily of fried chicken... tasty sauces and sides.. and the appetizers are clutch. Not much else to say, just good food."}
{"text":"Mediocre.  Ordered a wedge salad & they had no wedges. Then the salad had shredded chicken which was fatty & wired. Just not great. 
Really cute interiors & staff was very nice. 
Too many other better restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday for late night drinks and Sunday for a chicken sandwich. My mind is blown! The chicken sandwich and bloody Mary's are amazing! The service was super slow Saturday night but I forgive them on opening weekend. Excited to come back here often"}
{"text":"I ordered a breast and wing ($9 with no sides). I received a smallish breast fillet and a standard sized wing. The chicken was lukewarm. I read reviews of flavorful, crispy fried chicken. What I had was exceedingly bland and chewy. If you've ever gone to KFC during off hours and eaten chicken that has been sitting in a warmer for an hour or so, you know what to expect. $9 is too much to pay for extremely mediocre chicken. I went at 7:30pm, which should theoretically be fine for food freshness. If you're going to charge that much, it needs to be fried to order. Pathetic.

The potato wedges were hot and delicious. I also ordered a slushy, which was somewhat alcoholic and marginally flavorful. I wouldn't buy one again. 

Some of the other food looked good, but seriously; if a chicken restaurant serves fried chicken that I could compare to off-hour KFC, that's really saying something. It definitely has the *feel* of a great restaurant with fancy sides and high prices, but it doesn't deliver on taste."}
{"text":"YES! So many good things about this place, were do I begin...

Service! It was on point. Out bartender/buddy Clay was on top of it, per usual.

Slushies! They have moscow mule slushies! I can't wait until it's warmer out just so these things can hit the spot more than they already do.

Food! The pickle plate was delicious, the Nashville hot chicken was also amazing. My buddy had the tofu po boy and raved about it, so that'll be what I get next time I'm here.

All in all, I am so glad we have this place in town. And I love that they're open late on weekend nights.

The only downfall? Getting a seat. I know it's new, but I don't think this place will ever not be busy, and rightfully so. It's friggin great. And to those of you giving it a poorer rating for being busy, shame on you, that's a good thing!"}
{"text":"So I noticed that this place is a hit or miss with Yelpers. I can see why.  

While I won't signify on certain bearded candle lit hipster book writer who is trying to make downtown a thing, just because you build it doesn't mean they will come. I mean maybe they will come one time or maybe twice but that's probably it. 

First, the wait-- it was packed but I love fried chicken, so I waited happily at the bar. Someone here said to get the mule, I did. It was good. But prior to that, I had asked the bar back if I can order a drink at the bar and transfer it over to my bill when I moved to a seat, he said yes. Cool. Sit down, order my drink. Get it and then the bartender asked if I want to settle or open a tab, I said open a tab but that I'll be eating at a table. He said that's not a good idea because it confuses the servers and they don't like to do it. Fine.  

Now, given my experience at Nando's I try not to be annoyed and thought that maybe this is common practice around here, until... wait for it... this group of white folks also at the bar, are about to be seated and the customer mentions to the bartender to transfer the bill to restaurant and walks away. Ummm okay.  

But then my friend (who is also not white) comes through. Orders a drink and the bartender again gets him to settle at the bar. Whoa. 

The two pieces of fried chicken for 8 bucks?  They were good. Small but good. I don't know if it's 8 bucks worth, but I guess it's what chicken looks like when you don't inject it with hormones. 

And the server?  Hella attentive. To the point that I was like \"go away\". She never forgot us.  Normally, I would give this place 2 stars for that racialized interaction at the bar, but the overbearing server was trying, so I gave 'Em a 3. 

Overall, it's pretty expensive, but if you are craving some fried chicken with ambiance and don't mind waiting and confusion at the bar, then by all means..."}
{"text":"First timer. I ordered the Nashville Chicken dark meat and dessert pie. I underestimated how spicy Nashville would be-- I couldn't taste anything for a while! My mouth burned for a few hours after too, but I don't typically eat spicy. The juicy meat and crisp skin makes the BERN worth it (ha). I wish the skin was a little bit less moist and even crispier. The pie's creamy and sweet, though its crust is the opposite.

The atmosphere was incredibly loud. We sat near the kitchen and it was hard to hear the person sitting across from me. But that won't stop me from getting the best chicken I've had in the CU!"}
