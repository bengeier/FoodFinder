{"text":"This was the worst indian food I have ever had to date.
The staff was very friendly, it was clean, but awful.
We went here on a Sunday for my moms birthday, for the lunch buffet.
The food wasn't that warm under the heating lamps. They had tandoori chicken, butter chicken, rice, pakoras and a selection of desserts.

 After checking out the buffet, I opted to have butter chicken off the menu, hoping that that at least would be hot and fresh. When it arrived, it was hot, but the cuts of meat were terrible. It didn't seem like it was the chicken breast that the menu promised it would be. I picked at it, and hardly ate it. 

Meanwhile, my family was waiting for them to refill the buffet. It seemed like they brought one item out every 15 minutes, even though the buffet was empty.
The naan took the longest to restock, and it always seems flat and cold when it got there. I was smart, and ordered the naan from the menu, so when it came it was at least fresh.

I ate here about a month ago, and I still feel sick when I think about the cold, flavourless food. It's a shame, because they seem like really nice people, but they food just isn't good...."}
{"text":"Had chicken biryani, chicken tikka and ras malai here.
The biryani is awful! I don't know if it's a different \"style\" or what, but it's just... Not good. Nothing like what I would expect biryani to be. The chicken tikka is decent and quite flavourful, I was happy with that dish. And the ras malai.... Not good. Had that \"rubbery\" texture, yknow? Like chewing on a sponge."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday night, located in a really shoddy strip mall, lighting was really dark, and we were the ONLY persons in the entire place served by a single lonely guy. But good Indian food buffet for only $15 a person! I would say, come here with your buddies if you're hungry for some decent Indian food and don't care about decor or lack of crowd."}
{"text":"Was there yesterday buffet lunch . First impression was the food was the day before s . I was so right . The only fresh was the roti .
I cannot see myself there again ."}
{"text":"Booked the party room for 50 people; and was shocked to see the state of the room.   It was dark and shabby.  Terrible ambiance, tasteless food, and poor service.  Before booking the place, I  was promised kabab for appetizer but never got it; and mutton Karhai as one of the menu items, but both were missing.  The mutton item was all bones and few pieces of hard inedible meat; the chicken Tikka was under cooked with blood oozing.  I was promised fruit as one of the desert that too was missing. The only items that were good was the Nan and dal.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I've been going here quite a bit lately since I moved back to Scarborough and I must say it does the trick when your hungry. I have to say I've definitely had better Indian food for some reason the taste does seen rather bland for authentic Indian cuisine  I think the chiefs play it safe with the level of spice. Most dishes are delicious it just seems like something is missing for it to be considered real great Indian cuisine. I do not know enough about how to cook Indian food to say exactly what it is. I like the fact that the dishes are not salty, the only time I feel bad from the food is when I eat to much. The tandoori although good seems a little short on flavor, small pieces the butter chicken is quite disappointing it is very rich and doesn't taste 
like butter chicken I remember from other restaurants, not to mention it has bones in it what a sin. There always seems to be more sauce than chicken.The pieces I thought were quite small. The beef dish is good, the curry goat and chicken not so much the meat on these dishes seems very tough, I think they use the cheapest meat for the buffet. I haven't  tried the dishes on the menu yet bet I assume they are allot better. The veggie dishes seem old like they've been sitting their for days, overall the buffet does not seem to heat the food I have never seen the dishes really hot there not cold just lukewarm. The only hot item is when they bring the Nan bread from the oven. I really wish they had more of those famous  Indian
deserts, instead of ice cream which I don't think is sanitary to leave it there and everybody dig in to it and they need to cover it separately as well not just the door. The service unfortunately is not that great either the owner is very friendly, however the waiters seem disengaged like they just want to go home, no small talk no smile nothing. The worst thing for me about being served in a restaurant is when I have to ask for EVERYTHING, I don't mind sometimes but I always have to ask for another drink, more water, napkins remove bottles etc. every single time. The place does give the appearance of being clean especially the washrooms which is one of the reasons I go back. I must say I have seen attitude from some of the staff again not the owner who is always professional. On one occasion a girl working there who I never seen  before or ever since actually spoke rather rudely to me in an unfriendly tone for putting a little sauce back on the buffet dish from my plate OMG Call the police lol. Last thing I want to address is the decor definitely needs an upgrade seating could be set up better to maximize space, the carpet looks old and decrepit and the T.V looks nice but I've never seen it on. I don't think they want to pay for cable and no clock, whats up with that, oh I get it don't let people know what time it is so they won't leave to soon or have another beverage. The thing I hate about the buffet section is there is no light I think it should be the other way around lots of light to see the buffet and less light in the dinning room perhaps candles would make for a better dinning experience, flowers would create ambience, sometimes the music is too loud for dinning.  I think rather than everybody so close to each other in the dinning room they should use the other room as well especially on the weekends where seating is an issue. One more thing, through the week business is petty slow sometimes only me and a few people are there.So why play games with the few customers you have, one time a waiter who is no longer there charged me imported price for domestic beer I brought it to the owner's attention and he adjusted the bill the next time I went, no apologies were given everybody know's Budweiser is domestic duh. Another time I specifically asked for a Canada Dry Ginger Ale and that's the name it is listed as on the menu, the owner brings it to me and life is good. The next one I ordered he brings no name ginger ale I was so angry I just left as soon as I finished the meal I didn't want to lose it. Ant the no name of course tastes like crap that's why its cheap but he still charged me the $2.50. One time the said waiter who is no longer there when I asked him to remove the bottles from the table, he said you have a big table with lots of room. What the hell is he talking to me like that for. Unbelievable this is not how you talk to customers who pay your bills. As you can imagine it was reflected in the tip. Another time they tried to give me a bottle of beer that was opened for days flat as hell, they corrected that when I  spoke up about it.
Look I'm not saying to avoid this place at all, I just know they could make it a whole lot better.
I usually go alone and I've noticed the more people the better the service.(the  bigger the tip) By all means check it out the buffet used to be $10.95 they just raised it to $14.95 but the buffet items did not change at all, nothing new added go figure."}
{"text":"~WHEN
I went here for dinner with my friends for my birthday dinner last night. I was actually a little bit skeptical about the place and a little worried that the food will not be that great considering the fact that there are quite a bit of negative comments below me.


~THE FOOD
I am not Indian, so my opinion about the food would probably be subjective.  In my opinion, the food was actually quite tasty. But I feel like the spice of the food was toned down quite a bit to make it a little bit more palatable for non-Indian diners. I like my food VERY SPICY, and I wish I asked for like chilies or something. 

- The Butter chicken was good. Even though a buffet, the chicken was not dry. 
- I was afraid that the Tandoori Chicken would be dry but it actually wasn't. It was mostly dark meat but the chicken was not dry at all. 
- They had some Indian style pasta which I thought was quite funny (I whispered to my brother... \"this is for white people\" LOL).
- The rest of the food? I don't even remember what they were called. I think I had Aloo Gobi or something (Potato/cauliflower curry) but they were all quite tasty.

What got me really excited..... UNLIMITED NAAN BREAD, and you don't even have to ask for it. It keeps refilling itself.


~SERVICE
The servers were quite attentive. We did not have to wait for them to refill our drinks/water. I did not have to ask them to give us more naan bread, they just kept coming. The only time we had to ask them for something was when we needed our bill.


~OVERALL EXPERIENCE
It was good. It was inexpensive ($14.95 before tax, for dinner) I am sure there are places better than this one. But the fact that it is close to my house and school, I am a happy camper. I definitely would go back here if ever I crave for Indian food."}
{"text":"Living in East Scarborough, there are not a lot of Indian restaurants to choose from. I did a Google search and this place came up as the closest to me. I thought dinner buffet would be good to be able to try a lot of different dishes. They have a winter special right now so the cost of a week night dinner was only $10.95. This place was not crowded at all. We were brought fresh Naan to our table which was really good. The buffet itself looked pretty sad in its dimly lit space. I basically tried everything they had to offer. What I liked was the goat curry, chicken tandoori, beef vindaloo, and palak paneer although it was definitely lacking paneer. What I did not like was the assorted vegetable pakoras, and butter chicken. The price was good, but I won't be going back any time soon as I am sure there is better Indian food elsewhere."}
{"text":"My family and my family friends went in for the buffet for dinner and the food  was limited. I found that the food was very plain with no salt no spice no  taste,  really to be honest. The decor was  super old an dingy. We were seated by the server at our reserved table,  and then we were offered something to drink. When the waiter came he offered water or pop or alcoholic drinks but he stated instead of getting individual glass of pop, its better to get the jar. Apparently the pop is not free in the buffet, we ended up getting Coke and it was so water down due to all the ice that was thrown in.  We went to grab food and the plates weren't  that clean,  once i found a clean plate. I realized how limited  the food was and there  was hardly any veggie options the meat didn't  taste great either. The food was cold and dry, not not appealing at all.To be honest the butter chicken  I love having and this restaurant butter chicken was horrible the can of  butter chicken sauce  at NoFrills taste better then what they had.  The cart with the food  wasn't even full. Once we ate food  we had to use the same plate to get food again if we wanted seconds. We got free naan at our table and  the tv in the restaurant had black glare so we couldn't really enjoy it and they turned it off half way. The dessert was limited to ice cream which was almost empty, rice pudding and gulabjam  which wasn't that sweet. The waiters almost rushed us out by grabbing our plates once  we were done like they didn't want us to sit and enjoy each others company. I wouldn't recommend this as a buffet for  huge family dinner I rather go to Mandarin even though its pricier."}
{"text":"I and mexican buddy went to eat. Food was good . Will be back!!! Owner is friendly . Nice environment . They got Truck Parking too!"}
{"text":"This place seriously surprised me. It's in rough shape and in need of some refreshing so I automatically thought the worst. However, the old adage is true, never judge a book by it's cover. The food is surprisingly decent. The butter chicken and freshly made parathas were so good. The parathas are not placed on the buffet line, you need to ask the server because they make it to order. I'm fine with that because you can never go wrong with freshly made, buttery parathas YUM!  It's 12.99 for a lunch buffet with some good non-veg and veg options."}
{"text":"Went there for a Sunday lunch party. Food is horrible. Never spend your own money there. Indian foods don't taste like that.  food quality is very poor."}
{"text":"In Scarborough, Bombay Palace serves decent Indian food. As usual the restaurant falls into the usual litany of problems i have with Indian restaurants. Aloo Gobi 8.95? 

The food here I suppose is decent. There are a few dishes which you don't normally just make at home for a quarter of the price. I liked the Paneer Makhani. It was decent. 

The service was ok, the waiter did seem to take a while to get there. The food took a while too. The waiter seemed nice enough I suppose, at least he didn't walk around with the constantly constipated look on their face that some Indian waiters seem to think indicates class.

The ambiance wasn't horrid, wasn't great. Nothing really sticks out in my mind about it."}
{"text":"Good food (butter chicken was awesome) and great service....but the interior could use some improvement."}
{"text":"First time trying authentic Indian food and I loved it!! Even though they had small selection of items it was good for first timers like me. It was a very comfortable environment."}
{"text":"Small, quiet and tucked away in a plaza let this not deture you from the wonderful delights found inside. Well that's what it used to be like, after a recent visit I'm disappointed to say that the food quality has gone down and the flavours are not what they used to be. It's too bad, I used to enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"Was feeling peckish for Indian yesternight. So I ventured over to said eatery. Waiter was swift acting so bonus there, naans were fresh, favourite veg dish was their Mushroom Masala (mushrooms so savory from all the other juices penetrating into them). Time & time again my stable meats there are butter & tandoori chicken, never lets me down.

It's a good ayce to go to if you want to indulge in spicier foods."}
{"text":"Gross, went there today after 5 years and I can say the food was garbage, it was really bland and had no taste the buffet looked like it was sitting there all day and the butter chicken was water down,  I wasted my money and I will never go back there again!!"}
{"text":"It appears that the Bombay Palace has closed its doors.  I recently received a email from GroupOn indicating they were giving a refund for anyone that had purchased a coupon for this establishment.
It's really too bad they didn't invest more into this place.  I recall going here several years back and nothing much had really changed since I had first gone here back in the early 90's with my family.  Back then, it was one of the few large Indian buffets outside little India.  In addition to being outside the Indian core of Toronto, the Bombay Palace received praise from The Toronto Star and Toronto Life for it's delicious food."}
{"text":"Amy wife and I were in the mood for Indian food last night .  We weren't sure about this place as its in a low key plaza but we're glad we went. This is home style Indian food. Nothing was over salted or too rich we left after the buffet feeling good.  I suspect they use great ingredients and don't make the food taste better by loading it up with fat, it felt actually healthy.  The place was clean, the food was hot, and delicious. Everything from the pickles to gulab jamon were home made. Lots of veggie options and a  few meat options. I was a big fan of the makhni Dahl my wife loved the pakora and butter chicken. Fresh naan was brought to the table which was also amazing.  
The best part was the bill. Buffet for 2 with tax was less than $30 on a Thursday.
If you're wondering about this place try it out."}
{"text":"Visited this place with cousins 

Food was good 
Have a good spread of meats and vegetables
Decent pricing for Saturday night

Seafood not part of the buffet but you can order seafood 
dishes on the side if u r really craving seafood. I did that and 
the fish dish was amazing.

They also have Pani puri which we all thought was the icing on the cake.

(Wish if you don have to stand and make your own pani puris)

Hope they can get the Pani puri section in another area and not 
where the salads are kept so people can take their time to make 
them. 

Overall was good food and service. Until the next Indian craving ........surely will visit"}
