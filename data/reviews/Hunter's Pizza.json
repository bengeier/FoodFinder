{"text":"The new owners: Betty and Alex are amazing people with a precise talent of making delectable, authentic Greek Food. No matter what your order, Greek salad, or the chicken dinner; I'm sure even the fries and gravy, the order is proportionally large and extremely satisfying. The service is impeccable. It's comedic to see the servers race from one table to another as an attempt to satisfy the guests' hunger and demands.  It's a nice place with just the right aura and dim ambience to have intimate, romantic dinner or for that matter, a party of twelve.  Try you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Hunters makes great pizzas (not like pizza pizza or dominos) and souvlaki dinners.  For the dinners, they give you large portions with a huge greek salad to start.  I don't know how they make the dressing, but it's perfect for my taste beds as I do not like super salty, super tart dressings.  Their tzatziki is one of the best I've tasted as well.    The only bad thing I can say about the restaurant is that the decor is a bit run down."}
{"text":"Had been a long time since I'd been here.  Went this past Saturday.  It wasn't busy at all, maybe had 4 other tables going but somehow we waited 40 minutes for our dishes.  They didn't even give us garlic bread to hold us over.  I ordered Greek chicken salad.  It was just ok, the chicken wasn't tasty at all.  The dressing on the salad was the only reason the chicken had flavour.  He ordered the gyros platter and it was just ok and he only got one single olive in his salad.  My chicken salad had no olives.  (Maybe it's not supposed to have any, not sure). Waitress was pleasant but an apology for the long wait would have been nice.  I would go back to try the pizza some other time."}
{"text":"Definitely good food, good portions, good price...some of the best souvlaki I've ever had. The people working there were patient and friendly, and offered us a deal on two chicken dinners that they could have overcharged us for. Only downside for all tzatziki lovers out there.....you probably won't get enough! Overall though, 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"4.5/5 is the star rating I would give this place.   I recently went here with an amazing friend since we heard such great things about this place. I ordered the chicken souvlaki on rice with a Greek salad and he ordered the chicken souvlaki on a pita with a Greek salad. $9 lunch special. What more can you ask for. The chicken was nice and juicy and the salad was freshly made. The service was fantastic and there is definitely a warm at home feeling when you walk in. Nothing flashy and in your face. You can tell that this place has been running so many years due to the repeat customers and their amazing food.   I cannot wait to come back and try the other dishes that they have on their menu!"}
{"text":"Signage/exterior is about as appealing as a foot rub from someone you're not into, however, it was worth the drive to Scarborough. We had fries to start...hot, crispy; hit the spot. Then, the souvlaki lunch special: Chicken over rice, plus salad. Surprised by the American-sized portion. Simply divine. The meat was perfectly seasoned and grilled, the salad dressing was addictive, and the charming server (June, I believe)  was delightful. We tipped generously, and she's the reason for returning. Best of all, the price: $19.80 for two people. (Keep in mind, we drank water.)"}
{"text":"I've been going to Hunter's for years. Although this is a greek restaurant they do have the best thick crust pizza I've ever had in Toronto. Simple family dining, no frills and prices stuck in 1992 makes this a great value.   The owners are virtually always in the kitchen and have perfected the menu - especially the Hunter's Pizza, which is a five or six topping masterpiece with tons of cheese (add feta too for fun). Amazingly, the crust doesn't buckle under all the toppings yet remains soft.  Ordering the smallest Hunter's pizza at $12 is enough for one person. A medium is good for 2.   There is a limited delivery area, but worth stopping in for takeout if near Warden or Kennedy 401 exits. Huge Greek salads and garlic bread with cheese accompany most Greek dishes. These dishes are under $15. Prepare to be very full - both in your belly and wallet."}
{"text":"Better than any restaurant on the Danforth for Souvlaki! I am so glad that I don't have to make that trek anymore, because this place is the bomb.  The Lamb is moist and flavourful, and cooked to perfection every time. So, so tender! The Greek Salad is a mixture of Iceberg, Roma Tomatoes, Feta (lots of it), and a Red Wine Vinegar based dressing. The creamy feta, and garlicky vinaigrette is what makes it. I could easily eat the salad as a main, and call it a day. It's the best I've had anywhere.  It's called Hunter's Pizza for a reason, though I've never had their pizza. I've heard really great things, and will have to pry myself away from the souvlaki one of these days to try it.  My mom and dad are closeted food critics, but love this place too. This gets two thumbs up from my family!   Kalí óreksi!"}
{"text":"Such a great place, very family oriented. I've been coming here for years! The chicken dinners are the best, large portions and high quality food and service. The burgers are also very delicious!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Decent portions. Decent price.  Good tasting Food. Old fashioned ambience."}
{"text":"I almost feel bad writing a negative review of this place, since it seems like the kind of local joint that has been open forever and has a clientele of loyal regulars. However I have been here twice and haven't been impressed.  I can't recall what I ordered the first time (that might tell you something actually) but the second time I got the souvlaki. First I was served a Greek salad (with no olives, and very little cheese ... aren't those usually staples of Greek salads?) and then served the souvlaki. The chicken souvlaki itself was pretty dry, and it was served on a plate with a little rice and a few small potatoes. I expected a bit more for the money. It also took quite awhile for our meals to come out. To be fair we were in a bit of a hurry so it probably felt longer than it was.  The server was pleasant enough but seemed much more interested in chatting with the regular customers. It feels like a place that could've been on Restaurant Makeover. Not Kitchen Nightmares, it wasn't BAD, it just was rather drab. If you live nearby, or have been coming here for years, you may enjoy it, otherwise, you may want to pass."}
{"text":"Great locally owned place with a mix of Greek food and pizza. Although the combo is kind of weird (not really), the pizza is really good. Freshly baked, and clearly made in house.   Their souvlaki is quite good as well, not dry, and for some reason, their salad is really good."}
{"text":"Hunter's Pizza is one of those hidden gems in Scarborough.  You drive up to the plaza, walk-in, and may ask yourself if it's a good idea to. Believe me, if you're looking for a nice pie, you won't be disappointed.  Not only is the food good, the staff there are just very warm.  You'll feel very much at home here.  [Sides] Poutine - Honestly, there's nothing \"special\" about it but it is really good.  I normally like having a side of poutine with a sandwich or a burger but I'll have this with pizza.  5/5.  Onion Rings - Pretty much your standard onion rings that are not at all disappointing.  Great as a side if you want something crunchy and lighter.   [Main] Pizza - If you can't figure out what toppings to choose and aren't picky, get the Hunter's Deluxe Pizza.  Toppings include tomato cause, cheese, pepperoni, olives, mushrooms, bacon, onions, green peppers and sliced tomatoes.  Crust is nice and crispy and you get a generous amount of toppings.  Definitely a must try for all pizza lovers. If you have any leftovers, these pies toast very well in the toaster oven.  5/5.  Souvlaki Dinners - I've tried their pork, chicken and lamb and all are very good.  Even the lamb and I'm normally not a lamb eater.  You get a good amount of greek salad and potatoes on the side.  5/5  Banquet Burger - The patty itself is very juicy and is a good size.  You also get a good amount of bacon strips on your burger.  Definitely worth a try especially if you want a more affordable meal.  Cost me less than $5! 5/5"}
{"text":"Pretty good Greek food.  I've gotten their pizzas and chicken soulvaki I person prefer their chicken soulvaki.  The restaurant itself is on the small side and feels homey"}
{"text":"My review is only based on the pizza. I really wanted to love this place as it is not too far from my home and I am sick of always driving to Danforth PIzza or Liberotto for quality pizza. So I thought I would give it a try. Personally I should have just ordered Pizza Nova which is better. The cheese was gross. It had a funky smell to it and I had to ask the lady if they use old cheese ( which is fine with the right toppings ) But she stated it was only mozzerella and that with pineapple and ham was not good for me. I will try thr greek food next time and be optimistic as there are so many great reviews and the prices are very reasonable but for now the pizza is not good at all. Also the size seemed kinda small for the price."}
{"text":"I am so happy I've finally discovered this hidden gem. Greek food has always been one of my favorite cuisines, and I can say that this restaurant does it justice. The portions are big, but I suggest to share dishes with friends. The inside of the restaurant is also designed very pleasing with a European theme.  I will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Came here because it was one of the recommended cheap eats in Scarborough by BlogTO. Me and my friend ordered the chicken and lamb souvlaki.   Like other reviews, the salad was about 50% of the plate and full of cheese and quite fresh and flavourful. My chicken souvlaki was moist and cooked perfectly!   Only reason why I didn't give it a 4 was because of the old-fashioned decor of the whole restaurant and the feel. I know Hunter's has been around forever. I know it's really about the food but during my lunch, flies were flying around!  I'll definitely come back but for takeout."}
{"text":"Love this place, been going for years, highly recommend going because the food is good. Pizza is amazing when they put the toppings under the cheese."}
{"text":"4.5*  Not sure why this place is called pizza and burgers when the main focus seems to be Greek food. Nevertheless the food is delicious with good portion size and nice seasoning  Pork Souvlaki Lunch Special: -Large portion size -Rice was slightly bland but good texture -Souvlaki had burnt edges but still delicious and tender -Greek salad was very garlicky (in a good way), not enough feta and only one olive, still very good  Corned beef hash with 3 eggs: -Fries perfect crispness, nice flavour of oil -Nicely cooked eggs, toast buttered on both sides. -Good hash but small portion -Very tasty soup loaded with barley and meat, not too salty  Server (owner?) was very nice, good and fast service  Overall recommend, would definitely return :)"}
{"text":"A suggestion from a Yelp friend when I said was looking for some local cheap non-Asian food. I'd never even heard of this place which surprised me because it's less than 5 minutes from my house and when I pulled up I could see why. It's in a trashy nondescript strip plaza with a worn out fading blue on white sign. The kind of place that's easy to miss. The interior is just as uninspiring: dark, old wood furniture mixed with plastic (wood pattern! Haha) panelled furniture and walls, kitschy oil paintings and old battered menus.  That menu is pretty expansive with a mix of diner food staples, pizza, and Greek food. Don't expect anything too expansive in the Greek direction: they have souvlaki and a couple other dishes, but it's not a full on Greek restaurant. Or as the lady beside us said: \"Do y'all have that cheese you set on fire?\" Haha. No they don't have saganaki. I had the Chicken Souvlaki on a Pita lunch special and it was at this point that I learned how this place has stayed open for so long: the food! It was great for the price, the chicken, onions, tzatziki and tomato, were creamy messy awesome on the pita, and the salad was plentiful with a lot of feta (the best part!) tzatziki wasn't the best I've had, but it was pretty strong. Chicken was well spiced and cooked perfectly. The rice I stole from my lunch dates plate was pretty great too.  I'll definitely have to come back again some evening to try the Pizza and some other dishes. Service was friendly, familial and warm. The kind of place that when they say goodbye as you leave they're saying it because they actually appreciate the business not because they've been told to. Hunter's seems to be one of those quiet places that get by on the strength of the food and a steady repeat crowd. There's a reason all the furniture signs and menus are so worn out..."}
{"text":"Hunter's is a great place if you are looking for consistently decent Greek food at a reasonable price. The atmosphere is quiet, friendly, and family-oriented. I usually get their chicken souvlaki on a bun with a Greek salad, but their pork souvlaki, pizza, and sandwiches are also good. Although it's not a large restaurant, it can accommodate groups of 8-10 people, and it is good for any occasion."}
{"text":"We order pizza from this place all the time.   The pizza's are alway done well with plenty of cheese, and toppings.  Price is very good also!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with one of my coworkers, and actually really enjoyed the meal. We were originally planning on checking out Chris jerk which is in the same plaza  but unfortunately they were closed for the holidays. Definitely was not disappointed in this alternative.   I got the gyro plate lunch special and thought it was very tasty. Really big portions and lots of salad. The rice was nicely flavoured and while the gyro wasn't the best I've had, I really enjoyed it (they had about four slices of gyro, very good size).   The pizzas looked very good too so I will have to come back to try those out. They look like a really nice family run place and apparently have been here for quite some time, I can definitely understand why."}
{"text":"So based on reviews I decided to try hunters pizza, got a medium pizza with pep and mushrooms and I must say this place is average at best. Place was also dirty. Only plus was the staff was friendly. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place to go for Greek food! Service is friendly and fast. I got the pork souvlaki dinner for $12.50. It came with garlic bread, a large plate of Greek salad, a large skewer of pork souvlaki with rice and potatoes. Everything was delicious. Other reviews seemed to indicate massive portions but that's not true. The portions are generous and will definitely fill up one hungry person. The parking in the plaza can be a bit hectic depending on what time of day you are there. The plaza itself has quite a few other excellent eateries but if I'm in the mood for Greek I'll be heading to Hunters."}
{"text":"Yo star!  the thing is . Me love jerk chicken seen.  So it kind of broke my heart to walk past chris jerk chicken, smell the aroma and keep on keeping on as I enter into Hunter's pizza as they share the same plaza. The life of a foodie, I am not getting tied down to any thing no matter how  strong the feeling is. I love you chris jerk but you will occasionally see me at Hunter's pizza devouring char-cooked chicken souvlaki and begging for more tzaziki and crunching thru fresh salad which is laced heavy with feta cheese.   Its not you Chris Jerk. Its me. For I cant be tied down. I have to go around. I'm broken and don't want to be fixed"}
{"text":"I ordered Hunters for catering for a group of 45 people. They only charged me $12 a person! This is a gem in Scarborough. The best Tzatziki in town and huge portions! Everyone left with a full and happy tummy! I really reccomend this for catering if you're in a pinch. They make everything fresh and the taste is great. Home style greek dressing is excellent. The only thing was there were no cucumbers or olives on the salad. The Chicken souvlaki was incredible and everything arrived hot and ready to serve. Thanks Hunters! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I only do take out from this place, I call ahead as well just because I like to be in and out. The decor really needs an upgrade and a renovation in general, it feels dingy and dirty - even though the food is amazing.   I love the food here - specifically the souvlaki, salad and tzatziki. The pizza is also really good! I've tried the lasagna - not a huge fan and would call it mediocre at best.   The owners - previous and current - are exceptionally wonderful and polite too which makes my visits even more pleasant. If you're coming here I recommend to get the lunch special with all salad.  Oh I forgot to mention, the garlic bread is very good too!"}
{"text":"It may say Hunter's Pizza but they also specialize in greek food but I haven't been disappointed with either. I have been to Hunter's a few times and never got to reviewing it .   I find with either the souvlaki or the pizza the portions/size are big and they are fair prize. It's all good food so it's why I returned a few times."}
{"text":"Love supporting hidden gems that are family run. My yelp buddy told me this has been here for decades after telling him how much I liked this restaurant along with Chris Jerk beside it. Both delicious, great portions, and a price that will not break the wallet.  They dont just have pizza here, they have burgers and fries and souvlaki/greek food.  Seems like a very home-y joint when I visited and comfortable service too, all the patrons looked like they knew each other, lots of families. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome family restaurant. We had a pizza and chicken souvlaki dinner, everything was very good. Love the greek style pizza, very nice tasting crust, souvlaki nice and charred and moist....I'll be back.."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place but with the other options in the same plaza I never did! This past weekend I decided to go and try it out! I was not disappointed and I still think this place falls in line with the other options in this plaza - awesome!   We went at lunch and ordered the chicken souvlaki,  Greek fries and the mini deluxe pizza. Everything tasted so good! The portions were great and well worth it! I think the only complaint I had was that walking in, there was an odor in the restaurant, but I definitely didn't notice it after the meal came! I would probably do take out next time for this reason though."}
{"text":"Ordered a mini pizza with pepperoni, mushroom and double cheese. Their pizza is baked in a stone oven so it comes out with a crispy edge and a satisfying chew to the crust. Delicious toppings and a nice stretch to the cheese, it was cut all the way through so no toppings sliding off my pizza.   Hubby ordered the lamb souvlaki (cooked medium) lunch special with rice and a Greek salad. Wow! The lamb was tender and flavorful. Sides were tasty but the lettuce was limp.   I would have given this place 4 stars for the delicious food, reasonable prices, decent portions and friendly service but I had to take away a star for the limp salad and white, floating specks in my water (Hubby drank canned pop and I had the coffee with free refills instead)."}
{"text":"I had most of their dishes over the years. Their Lamb Souvlaki Dinner is awesome. Pizzas are good."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here tonight for me and, uh,  a friend, yeah. I totally didn't order a whack of food just for myself. Again. Anyway, I was in the mood for some non-commercial tasting, non-corporate pizza, and I found Hunter's Pizza, which was en route to my destination. I heard this was a family operation, and that couldn't be closer to the truth. It felt so familial I kept expecting to be asked to keep my elbows off the table while I waited for my food. It felt as though I were in someone's home. The man (who I assume was Gus?) Was very nice and polite. I ordered a small pizza with hot peppers and mushrooms,  and a greek salad. The salad was a tad rubbery, with only 1 kalamata olive, but it had feta and oil a plenty, and it was tasty. The pizza looked a little disappointing at first, but it tasted amazing. It had that homemade flavor and texture I was looking for. The damage was $15, and I tipped a few bucks on top of that, but I enjoyed it so much more than I would have a pizza chain. I will likely be back to order again for me and, uh, my friend."}
{"text":"I got the eggs benedict ($8.95) yesterday. I opted for spinach instead of ham, and homefries instead of fries. This thing came with 3 eggs and a ton of hollandaise. If I read their menu correctly, I was supposed to get toast and jam as well, but it never came and I didn't bother to ask. I was too full. I was asked how I wanted my eggs. I was super confused. I said poached. She said, \"of course, but soft, medium, or hard\". I went for soft. They were definitely done right. Soft and runny and delicious. I wish I had my phone on me so I could have taken some pictures, but I forgot my phone yesterday. Sad times. Portions here are huge, and prices are very reasonable.   This place has an an old school feel, and when I mean that, I mean authentically old school, down to yellowing wallpaper and slightly sticky tables, but it all adds to the authenticity of this place.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"we ordered the Gyros dinner, Lamb souvlaki dinner, Chicken souvlaki dinner and a pork souvlaki pita wrap. Everything was so good, all the meat were tender. But it could be a bit more flavourful? Maybe i'm just used to those chain greek restaurant flavours (like jimmy the greek have really intense flavours), but sometimes wishing there's a bit more flavour. But the meat quality is pretty good.   However, service was a bit slow and honestly the place is a tad dirty. Mom found an eyelash or something in her pork souvlaki pita???? Pork was tough.   But all in all, food is pretty good but if you're a germaphobe then maybe skip this.  Would be back for takeout if we don't know what to eat, but otherwise would probably just go to mr. Greek or something."}
{"text":"We eat from here regularly. Great tasting food. I love the fact that they do catering, which has come in handy when we have had to arrange functions. I've tried the poutine, burger, pizza, chicken souvlaki, greek salad, garlic bread, and tazaki. Overall, we've been happy with Hunter's and have dined and ordered catering for over ten years. Always delicious, flavourful, and most importantly reasonably priced."}
{"text":"A family hidden gem in Scarborough serving thousands for decades.  Known for their homemade pizzas and greek food.  A place that's as homey and classic like its decor, its like going to grandmas house.  This joint is clean, the food is always made from the heart, and the prices don't hurt your wallet, Hunter's PIzza will always be around to serve those who are and have been fortunate to stumble into this diner."}
{"text":"Their souvalki is big and fantastic but their deluxe pizza is possibly one of the best pizzas I've ever had and I use that loosely.  If you don't like items on your pizza or are a I'll pick it off people just stay away and never let me see you as long as you live because this isn't cheap pizza of dumb kids, this is the real deal.."}
{"text":"Good bang for the buck! 3.5 stars  I dropped in out of chance, only because my default restaurant was closed for the day and it was right next door. I was a bit intimidated at first because it looked a bit dim, but then again, I'm there to eat.   The portions are generous. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the salad (over 50% of the plate). It was a bit simple. I do like my red onions and olives, but then again, I'm paying about as much as eating at the food court and it's fresh. I also like that the salad wasn't swimming in its own dressing.  They make good lamb souvlaki. I ordered it medium-rare, more rare. I have yet to try other dishes."}
{"text":"This is a small dive in a small place just off birchmount. When we walked in nobody greeted us and we stood around for a while before some worker who was eating her lunch called over to another lady in the back to come seat us. The decor is quite old and run down. The carpeting on the floors were quite dirty and covered with food. There were only about 3 full tables besides ourselves (part of 2 plus a toddler).   We ordered a make your own pizza in the mini size and it was a great portion size. The pizza was good, not great but it was good. The toppings were pretty stingy but the crust came out great. In all the time we were there the waitress almost never came over to us. We were waiting for water on multiple occasions and almost got up and served ourselves. We ordered 2 souvlaki pitas which again were ok but not great. What is great is the price! We also ordered chicken strip combo for our son and we ended up paying less than $40.00 for everything including tax. It's ok for a quick bite in your in the area but I was not wowed and was expecting more given the high reviews."}
{"text":"Excellent take out special - 2 chicken souvlaki dinners for $20.95. You get Greek salad, garlic bread, rice potatoes, chicken souvlaki and tzatziki (made with real Greek yogurt). I usually eat the salad, bread and a piece of chicken then save the rest for another meal. They are great about calling ahead and having your order ready for pick-up."}
{"text":"Place looks like a dive - but excellent value and quality.  So far I have sampled:  Chicken Souvlaki dinner;  Good size portion, perfectly grilled chicken.  I'll have this again.  Deluxe Pizza; Tasty crust, delicious tomato sauce.  Fresh ingredients, on which they don't skimp.  If I have pizza craving, I go to Hunter's"}
{"text":"Chicken soulvaki was great but wasn't a fan of the greek salad. Did get a lot of food for the money.  Overall a decent enough place. Place was very busy when I was there with a lot of take out orders for pizza, I'll give that a try next time."}
{"text":"The greek salad is where it's at. The concept is so simple, it's mostly iceberg - nono...it's mostly feta, tomatoes, red onion, with some sort of citrus or vinegar note to the salad. It's hard to replicate - believe me, I've tried, and that's why there's no way I'm not having any greek salad when I come here.    The lamb souvlaki special is one of my favourite dishes! a large portion of skewered meat - grilled to my liking. I like the lamb medium rare- it's tender, perfectly chard and so flavourful! Comes with large portion of aforementioned salad - and pita or rice. Pork and chicken options available too. I know they also have it as a dinner option with is slightly more - but comes in addition with a side of roasted potatoes, and garlic bread.   Pizza is also pretty tasty here. Hunter's deluxe features  peppers, onions, bacon, and other goodness -all on a delicious crust  that reminds me of pizza hut crust- but with WAYYYY less grease. Ask for it to be well done though - Sometimes the pizza base can't hold all the goodness of the toppings.   There's take out service which is pretty reliable.   DOO IT!  Prices are very reasonable for what you get. I think all the souvlaki specials come in to about $9-13. The dinners usually cost a couple of dollars more maybe closer to 15$ but it's reasonable for the amount and the quality of food!"}
{"text":"Hunter's Pizza is one of my favourite restaurants. I enjoy the environment. It is extremely homey and cozy. The customer service at this location is great. The price of the food is pretty reasonable for the amount of food you receive. For example with the chicken soulvaki, you receive a huge amount of Greek salad and bread with a big portion of rice,potatoes and chicken."}
{"text":"The name Hunter's Pizza is a bit misleading. While there is pizza, their menu is quite extensive and I would say it's mostly known for their Greek food. And pizza, but every time I come here it's for the souvlaki.  I usually get the chicken souvlaki with rice under the \"lighter fares\" section. Don't be fooled - the portion is enough, unless you're a guy who eats a lot. It's a bit less than ten dollars. The regular meal comes with a few pieces of potato and the portions for everything are a little bigger but it is essentially the same meal for 13 dollars instead of about 10.  Greek salad is good and dressing isn't too sour. Occasionally there will be a bit too much water which goes into the rice, but it usually is not a problem. Rice is well-seasoned, very much a comfort food. Chicken souvlaki is not the most tender I've ever had but it is still good and tastes good as well. I've had the gyro and while it is good it is a bit too salty for my taste. Meals come with some garlic bread as well which is decent.  I would suggest that you come here for Greek food or pizza. Everything else is not really worth it. We paid more than ten dollars for what was cold, overcooked spaghetti in a meat sauce that tasted like salt. Never getting that again. While I've never had the pizza, I've heard good things from friends.  Service is SLOW. Not unfriendly though. Expect to be there a while, they are understaffed and they are always working on doing takeout orders too (maybe because people know that eating in will take a while). But overall, Hunter's is a good bet for decent Greek food at a great price."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the city. I'd probably never have ventured in to this strip mall restaurant if I didn't grow up in the area, but I now drive from midtown to visit regularly. Best souvlaki and pizza in the city! Big portions. The owners are good people who take pride in their food."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for greek food.  Sometimes when it is busy, service can be slow. But they are all super nice and friendly.  The place is outdated with outdated decor. I hope a renovation is in their plans as the place is a little run down, and sitting in there for a long time can make us feel really uncomfortable.  My 4-star rating is of course based on the food, and the great service.  Salads are fantastic, entrees are all delicious and plentiful, chicken, pork, lamb, get them all!"}
{"text":"I've come to this restaurant quite a few times over the years. Regarding the look, decor and interior it isn't quite the best. The sign visibly shows missing and faded letters and inside is dark with nothing special. The carpet was dirty for years until they finally decided to replace, otherwise no significant changes.   The old owners I have always taken a liking to, they are very friendly to everybody that enters their restaurant. Gus, also the cook, would also come out to personally greet some of the patrons and ask about the food. What it lacks for interior design, it makes up with good service.  As many of noted, the name of the restaurant is odd as this is mostly Greek food. All the souvlaki dinners are inexpensive and come with a mountain of greek salad. The meat is always juicy and flavourful, I've tried all of them and lamb is definitely my favourite.  The pizza is odd in a sense that the toppings are placed in the middle with the cheese covering the top. From a food engineering standpoint this is terrible, the toppings/cheese just slides off because of the sauce IF you use your hands to eat, with a knife and fork it is no problem. The crust is thin, but not too thin like a cracker with good chew. A generous amount of toppings and cheese with perfect amount of sauce for moisture. Overall a good pizza, the only downside? A little pricey.  It recently came under new management, but they have stayed true to the food. Everything tastes similar to what I remember. I am bias as I feel the old owners had that charm, but overall still pretty good."}
{"text":"Hunter's is the go-to place for lunch as it's the closest Greek restaurant to workplace. Further, we often have our meetings catered from here.  Hunter's serves fresh pizza and yes, it is good, but I have had better. I have tried their pork and chicken souvlaki meals more than a handful of times and they are standard quality, similar to food court quality. However, I must say, their lemon roasted potatoes are amazing. Warning: They do not allow substitutes on lunch specials.  When you first walk in, you automatically get the sense that this is a family-owned restaurant. The place is dark, even when it's bright outside. The restaurant is carpeted and who knows when they last changed it. The decor is extremely old and tacky and not appropriate for 2014, 2009 or 2004 for that matter.  The service is quite slow and often there is only one waitress serving all the tables.   Despite how much I dislike the decor and service, I will likely return because it's the only place that serves somewhat decent Greek food and pizza in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Service is a bit lacking but the portions are amazing, and the pricing is fair. If you're looking for some Greek food that is comforting, this is the place to go. We usually order the small sized chicken souvlaki with rice. It comes with salad and sometime depending in the server garlic bread. We almost always have to get a box for our leftovers! The chicken is juicy and and hardly dry even when you order take out instead. I recommend take out if you want you food fast"}
{"text":"Hunter's makes the best pizza in the area. Anybody can make pizza but if you want to make a great pizza you have to know how to make a good dough. Hunter's still make it the way they used to in the old days. Their Hunters deluxe is the tastiest. I travel pretty far for it.  The rest of the menu has a lot of options with lots of tasty pasta and Greek dishes. They also give you a lot of food for the buck."}
{"text":"This place is close to where I live so I'm partly bias just because of the short distance but they have really good food at decent prices as well! I was here on a weekday and there weren't that many patrons but quite a few came for take-out. I haven't tried their famous pizzas but I had a burger combo while my friend had the chicken souvlaki dinner, both of which were yummy and fairly priced. The meals are really filling and \"homey\" so come with an empty stomach and be prepared to leave in a food coma.  UPDATE: I came in for dinner on a Friday night and it was packed! I had the chicken souvlaki on a pita and it was great. Really worth it."}
{"text":"First time I went to Hunters, for lunch, about a month ago, I shared a large pizza, pepperoni, bacon, mushrooms, with 2 others. It was more than enough, there were a couple leftover slices. And more importantly it was delicious! Crust was perfect combo of crunch and chew. Sauce was balanced. Fantastic pizza overall. So glad to have finally tried this place, I'll be a new regular. Only criticism is the Greek salad has no cucumbers and too few tomatoes. It tastes good but the cucumbers really are missing. Second visit, for dinner, was also delicious. I had the lamb souvlaki dinner and my partner had the chicken souvlaki dinner. The salad was just as the first time. The garlic bread though was awesome, perfectly crunchy on the outside with sesame seeds and soft on the inside, and warm of course. The lamb was cooked to my liking, medium rare, you can choose. So flavorful and tender. The rice and potatoes were delicious.I ate almost all of it somehow. Normally I wouldn't have been able to and would take half home but I guess I was just that giddy! Service was great, had this great Irish server, who was sweet! She called us loves! How can you not like that! Prices reasonable. Location good, free parking. In a small plaza with other restaurants which I'm looking forward to trying. Decor is dated but clean so who cares. I think it's homey. You must eat here!"}
{"text":"1.5/5 Stars  Came here with my girlfriend. No one greeted us when we waited in. After a few minutes, the one waiter in the entire restaurant told us to wait. We waited for another 10 minutes before we were given a table.  When we sat down, we were given water and we noticed that there was a white transparent substance in the water. It looked kind of like oil so we decided not to drink the water.  Now, on to the food! We ordered the chicken/lamb souvlaki dinner with no rice, potatoes and garlic bread but instead requested for extra salad. It took half an hour for our meals to arrive.  Our salad came first, it tasted good. It's hard to mess up Greek salad. Then came a basket of garlic bread with cheese that we asked to be replaced with salad. However, we decided to keep the garlic bread any way and I'm glad we did because my girlfriend liked it! It looked delicious because of the cheese but I didn't try it. Following this, we received our entrees(souvlaki), which we expected to have extra salad instead of rice or potato but all we got was the meat with tzatziki sauce. We felt really disappointed.  In terms of atmosphere, as you would probably read from other posts, was dated, dirty and had carpet. The fans over the turned off lights were spinning out of control. It felt like a horror movie as it looked like it would have fallen any minute and chopped someone's head off.  In conclusion, we will not be coming back because of the poor service due to understaffing, the cleanliness and the poor quality of food. Our total came to around $35 for a skewer of meat per person, a salad and garlic bread, which seems like a rip off to us!   Thank you for your services and we hope your business improves!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Hunter's Pizza at Birchmount and Huntingwood. It's a local mom and pops restaurant serving amazing pizza and great Greek food. My friends and I ordered some regular favourites and looked forward to another great meal. To our disappointment, this was not the case.   The pizza was still acceptable, but lacked a few things that we were used to. First off, we ordered a medium size and what they brought out definitely looked like a small. Second, there wasn't enough cheese and it didn't have that delicious little golden brown look on top. The pork and chicken souvlaki dinners - a staples here - was another huge disappointment. The meat was overcooked and dry, the rice and potatoes were average, the tzatziki sauce was runny, the cheese bread never came, and their famous Greek salad never showed up either. We were so busy talking that we didn't even think about it until we had paid and left. So we didn't even get to eat one of the best things on the menu. And to add insult to injury, the food took forever to come out and it felt like an oven in the restaurant - little or no air conditioning. There were only two other tables including us. We had noticed that the waitress and everyone in the kitchen was different - no sign of the owners.   After some investigation, we found out that the management had recently changed. We're not happy about this and I'm sure that others are feeling the same. My advice to the new owners is to get their act together and do it fast because if you decide to take over an established restaurant, a hidden gem in our neighbourhood, do it right or the locals will not be back."}
{"text":"Hunter's is a great family restaurant that serves generous portions of Greek salad, rice, and potatoes with a souvlaki dinner. In fact, I'm never able to finish and am always left wondering why I didn't order a smaller portion. I usually order the chicken souvlaki dinner, and the chicken is really delicious. My kids love the pizza! Service is always friendly as well."}
{"text":"This is hands down my go to Greek spot! Authentic hole in the wall that has been a family run diner for decades. I usually go for the lamb souvlaki (med rare) on pita with Greek salad. The meat is always cooked to perfection to your liking and always juicy! One plate of their house Greek salad would keep u coming back for more because as someone who struggles to finish his greens, boy do I lick their Greek salad clean off the plate. 10/10 service 10/10 food and 10/10 cleanliness!   Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Hunter's Pizza has apparently been standing in the same spot for decades. The appearance of the interior, decor, furniture, and regular patrons definitely supports that notion. Deceptively good is one way I'd describe everything from the name of this place, down to the food and the service.  Pizza is only a small sample of what they offer, as they have breakfast food, burgers, and specialty greek dishes all on one menu. You could even stop here for a beer or a stiff drink, if you wanted to. A friend of mine convinced me to try their 'mini' pizza, and for $7.50 (two toppings) it definitely didn't disappoint. The homeburger wasn't the best I've ever eaten, but for $5.95 it was worth trying out.  There's no flair here at Hunter's, just fast, reliable service. The pizza is just so homemade looking and tasting, you'll want another one the moment you finish your first. I've always loved a pie where the cheese is smothered on top of the other toppings. Stringy mozzarella is a traditional way of making pizza that has gone by the wayside, replaced by thinner crust and lightly topped pies.   It's good to see family-owned and operated businesses still thriving, especially in low-lying pockets of suburbia. Come here if you're looking for that hidden gem, old school feel, on the cheap."}
{"text":"I like everything so far. The chicken wing and the Hunter's Deluxe pizza are both great."}
{"text":"Probably a 3.5/5 in reality. Had the chicken souvlaki, it was good but not extraordinary though. Took a pizza away, this is where it is at for Hunter's. Much better than what you can get in the area, and certainly better than chain pizza. Word of advice though, the deluxe seems like a kick ass idea, but with all the toppings it makes for a very messy eating experience, but now you know.  Decor is dated as many described already, but I thought the service was pretty good for one person working the room.  Will get food here again, for sure."}
