{"text":"Great place! The food is delicious, fresh, and beautifully presented. The staff are very friendly and kind. Everything we had was very good - will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"4 star for what it is, compared to other AYCE in the Newmarket area. You can get your sashimi and sushi fix. Small and quiet place (walls are non descript) but servers are polite, attentive and quick with the orders.  What makes them different: lamb skewers are a must try , ebi shrimp and octopus sashimi, and double spicy rolls! Mainly 'japanese' dishes, not many other Asian  dishes i.e. Chinese, Thai... not a critcism, an observation.  Our go to place for ayce japanese  in east newmarket."}
{"text":"We only came to try coz its new. It is clean, although it was getting busy we still got what we've ordered on expected time. The staffs are nice. The foods are pretty much the same as other sushi restaurants that we've been to. General Sushi is just a bit pricy though compared to other EAYC sushi places.
We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"we've been 3 times once when it first opened , food was great, our second time a few months later wasn't as good and disappointed. ..my wife talk me info giving it one more shot and still hadn't change for the better! back to golden maki!"}
{"text":"Sushi was lacking. Presentation is minimal. Falls apart when you pick it up. Very minimal amount of sashimi in the sushi. Had to ask for eel sushi twice, while they only had 1 other table to serve. They skip orders. Service is mediocre. Only ended up here cz Golden Dragon was closed. Going there next."}
{"text":"This is another addition to Newmarket's ever rising sushi restaurants. General Sushi is an AYCE joint that seems promising, well, I think, from my meal on this day, whole it still has it's grand opening promotion. I love the set up, small and intimate, with only 9-10 tables/booths. There is a picture of what each sushi looks like for those who need the visual aids. The cups for serving tea also has pictures of the sushi assortment. The sushi chef works behind his counter, in the middle of the place, and I love that I can see them make the rolls. Of course, there is a kitchen that you can't see into in the back for cooked dishes, such as the tempura, udon, and mini donburi plates. 

Right, the sashimi pieces, yummmmy, succulent, fresh and meaty! I love the mackerel because it tastes fishy like it should be, but doesn't smell fishy. Did I say yummy? Okay, the rolls, I got the typical hubby-won't-eat-shrimp-rolls. We got the BBQ eel and avocado, spicy salmon rolls, and a new one rolls for me, as asked and recommended by the server, the Black Pearl special roll. That had BBQ eel on top and cooked fish in the middle. I don't know what fish it was in the roll but it was so good. I wanted other rolls with shrimp but couldn't (thanks hubby). They have other options for shrimp eaters. I will try them next time for sure because all of the dishes we ordered were so fresh and tasty. 

Of course, it is the grand opening week. Maybe that has an influence over the fish, meals, customer service, and rate. Golden Maki is in the opposite corner, too. I hope that my next review of General Sushi would still depict the same potency in taste and representation.

Tip: grand opening is 10% off right now (March 28, 2015)."}
{"text":"Decent sushi & rolls, good hot & sour soup, good tempura & Udon, my kids really enjoyed the teriyaki chicken. 
Great variety of ice creams, good flavours. 
Good food at reasonable price."}
{"text":"Service was so bad, we have to self serve get high chair for my infant. The server doesnt refill the tea. The sashimi was extremly not fresh and not good, Do not order the siu mia, lamb skewer, onion rings and squid balls. Never  never  not come again."}
{"text":"Order a combo yesterday and asked them to substitute 6 california rolls and dumplings for eel rolls. They did, but to my surprise they only gave me one! How cheap. They owner also didnt care when i complained to them. He said it costs more. Yet they did it for me three different times already. SORRY GENERAL you have lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service and the presentation was really what made this sushi restaurant stand out above the rest."}
{"text":"The general is demoted to private in my books. I just can't settle for a sliver of fish on a fist full of rice being called sushi. After all, who walks away from all you can eat sushi after only one small order? The salmon was fine, but thin as paper. The mackerel, normally a somewhat fishy fish was really on the powerful side.

The chicken teriyaki and chicken wings were fine, but very little flavor. Quality and quantity has really slipped since my last visit. With Chitose  moving to a new location, and Golden Maki having a fire, this leaves only one sushi restaurant on the east side of town. The only solution is to go to the west side of town or down to Aurora. Or Richmond Hill. Or anywhere else.

Sorry general, you are on KP duty!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for AYCE dinner. The restaurant was very quite with just one other couple seated. We grabbed a booth and they were quick to bring the menu and our drinks. 

We ordered a bunch of sashimi, maki and some hot food. All the hot dishes were served relatively fast. We did have to wait quite a bit for the sashimi though. As with most AYCE places the sashimi wasn't the best but it was also not fresh except for the white tuna. The sashimi cuts were too thick but it was beautifully presented. The rice to fish ratio in their making was good but the rice was bland. The hot food was not seasoned too well. I liked the variety on the dinner menu but they do need to improve on the quality.

Compared to the other Japanese restaurants around our experience was OK. Will probably try out their a la carte next time."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 4 because the customer service was superb and the food was tasty.

I'm torn because I loved the flavour of the sushi rolls but truly disliked the atmosphere. The black pearl is my favourite, that was so yummy. The avocado salad was too good; creamy and ripe. But I have to admit, the restaurant is just boring! The flowers in our food were cute and all but they need some pizzazz! It's like, blank white walls, some professional sushi photos and chill music. 

I don't really know how to rate this one because I'm just confused. I think I need to go back and try again. The sushi sandwich has zero flavour so I'd say stay away from that. Otherwise, two thumbs up for the rest of the menu. The service was attentive and it seemed like they really cared about our experience. I just can't get over the walls. The salmon is super dense which I wasn't ready for so maybe that's what has thrown me off? Either way, I'm willing to try again.

My company noticed the take out menu had some decent prices though."}
{"text":"Amazing service and fresh food! Since I love sushi, I have to try every sushi restaurant in Newmarket, and so far General Sushi is my favourite. It's great that they have stamp cards because it makes me want to keep going back for a free dinner! I always get AYCE and the food comes really fast. There's a lot of variety and creativity on the menu! The staff is really friendly! If you want sushi, definitely come here!"}
{"text":"Service was fast, friendly and efficient.   Place was clean.   Miso soup was decent. Now for the not so good part, the food. The sushi and the rolls were completely tasteless and almost all rice with very little fish, avocado, etc."}
{"text":"I drove 45 min because I heard this was very good sushi.  I placed my order and specifically asked for no fish eggs as I cannot eat them.  When I get home I see that they disregarded my request and put tobiko in my sushi.  I wasted $20 on ordering form this restaurant.  The staff would not do anything to fix the issue either.  DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice little place in Newmarket.  We tried the all you can eat sushi and had lots of variety to choose from.  Amongst the many dishes we ordered, really loved the Black Pearl Roll!  Service was great, attentive and friendly.  We also ordered California rolls, dynamite rolls, green dragon and spider rolls which were well done.  The edamame was a little disappointing as not cooked enough but overall good experience and will try this establishment out again."}
