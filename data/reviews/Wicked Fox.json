{"text":"Today a group (4) of us ate lunch here. We were the only people in the restaurant. Approximately 5 minutes later another 2 people came in, and finally another table of 3 came in. So 3 tables to service. After 15 minutes of having the menu, I had to call the waiter over (who was stacking menus). After ordering, we then waited another 20 minutes for 3 burgers and 1 BLT. There were other subtle things that were annoying, such ad we said type of cheese on sandwich, and then waiter says what type of cheese. Then after order placed and 5 minutes later, waiter asks what type of cheese for BLT. The Wicked BLT was special and almost certain it didn't even come with cheese. Also, once we finally got the check we didn't get itemized receipt. We tried to get waiters attention ( doing the hand raise thing), he was a few feet from us, but of course didn't see us and so more waiting. He was a nice young kid but very slow and didn't seem to know what a waiter does.  Food was OK. I would go again only if I had time to waist and was not super hungry. Hopefully they learn to pick up the pace. I can't imagine what it would be like if they were actually busy."}
{"text":"If you like good craft beers COME TO WICKED FOX! They have a great selection with the cheapest prices I've seen. And great food ... tonight we had the loaded tots and wings; not your typical hot wings with Frank's red hot sauce. The bar grub is done with class and tastes great, but doesn't come with the snobiness that usually accompanies places with upscale food and bev. Two thumbs up, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food it's fresh and well prepared, the staff is friendly and informed on the menu"}
{"text":"Pros: the menu has a decent variety, the veggie chipotle burger was really good, fries were also good. 
-the draft list is not huge, but the beer on it is good beer. Also have a big cooler with a large variety of bottles. 
-great seating, tables and at the bar. Nice atmosphere. 

Cons: still a little unorganized since they just opened, but won't stop me from going back, I'm sure they'll sort it all out."}
{"text":"The food was very good for bar food. The craft beer selection was great. I enjoyed my first time visit."}
{"text":"Taps are bad I exchanged it for a bottle beer
Says fresh hand breaded fish it was just a frozen and patty
I guess that's why no one was there
Looks like it closed down"}
{"text":"Been here 4 times now and have always had a great experience. The bar staff is fantastic-attentive but courteous!  Great happy hour specials including half off appetizers. A huge selection of draft beers all of which are also on HH special. If you are ever hungry I definitely recommend the loaded nachos!"}
{"text":"I went there and their food was horrible. I ordered their nachos and the cheese was runny and the chicken was cold. My sangria was pink and tasted like fruit punch. The atmosphere was nice. They had a band and very family friendly. They must improve their food however."}
{"text":"I wanted to review this restaurant not only for the food..but mainly for the service. When we dine with our two toddlers, we are always a bit worried of what will happen (meltdowns/crying, etc) ..we took a chance on this place, knowing the casual scene.. and also having a kids menu.., we knew it would be a safe bet. We were not disappointed. Our waitress, who, I apologize, do not remember her name, although she was only one of two, if not the only waitress...was the most accommodating, nicest waitress I've ever encountered. Our youngest had a few freak outs... And when he did, she came over and talked to him, and even offered some puzzles, coloring books (that she had probably gotten herself) It was the nicest gesture, and made us feel welcomed...she was very attentive with our food, and overall made it a great experience. Oh, and the food was bomb."}
{"text":"Same setup as the previous tenant  Beer Nuts just a different paint job. Bathroom hasn't been cleaned since it was beer nuts. Food is descent and good beer choices. Happy hour specials are good."}
{"text":"Ordered the burger with crab meat medium rare EXCELLENT !!! Appetizer we had the tater tots with cheddar Gouda and bacon very sinfully delicious!!! Emma was our waitress very helpful and attentive would go back again"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Menu was diverse. Friendly staff. Owner and kitchen manager were there, making sure everything was satisfactory. Good environment, great neighborhood and location. Cleeeean, to all you that think that is an important aspect as I do. I. Will. Be. Back."}
{"text":"This has some great bar food, but with some higher end entrees to round out the menu.  We got wings and a burger.  The wings were just the right amount of hot and very meaty.  There was a band trio playing some fun jazz.  The beer selection is great.  Seems like there is rotating taps and lots of seasonals.  i will go back again to try some of the interesting menu items and the specials looked awesome (bacon and blue cheese mussels.  mmmm)"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the soft opening last night, they officially open on Monday. Menu is varied,  some bar food, some pasta options etc. There's a cauliflower flatbread (yes the flatbread is made of cauliflower) that I'm looking forward to trying next time. We had an appetizer (chicken florentine dip) and for dessert key lime pie in a mason jar! So yummy!  They'll have 24 taps, and a small craft cocktail menu and will have a nice craft beer collection. For those of you who patronized Beer Nutz I think this restaurant will be even better. They relocated the bar and there's artwork on the walls that's really nice. Some of the same employees from Beer Nutz are back and if you're like me, they were wonderful people i.e. Dorian and Emma. This place will once again be our neighborhood go to place I'm sure!"}
{"text":"I have only been here once so far, but the Wicked BLT I had was excellent.  In addition to thick bacon coked just right for a BLT, slightly crispy, but still a little chewy (key to a good BLT), it had this tasty, spicy mayo (the \"wicked\" part, I presume) that really made the sammy.  I also liked the buttered, grilled bread.

The side was house-made tater chips that were also really nice.  I took this meal to go, so I need to go back and go inside.  If/when I do, I will publish an update.  But for now, I do recommend the food!"}
{"text":"This is a great little bar if you love a relaxed space and good bar food. There is a bar and a small dining area with TVs scattered throughout, but it's never too loud or annoying. We have sat at the bar as well as the dining area and had wonderful service at both places. 

We usually eat wings when we stop by (I can't really remember ever ordering anything else!) as well as their homemade chips. Their wings are great and extremely reasonably priced, with a few different sauce options. The fresh chips are delicious, and usually dusted with a seasoning mix. If you go during happy hour, all of the appetizers are half off, including the wings! The last time we were here my fianc√© and I each ordered wings and chips, and our total was less than $15! 

They also offer an extensive draft and bottle list, as well as a few signature cocktails and basic wines. But we typically go here just for the wings and chips. 

I am hoping that more people discover this restaurant so that it stays in business and continues to be our go-to place for wings in the Fox Chapel area."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place as I was wandering around Fox Chapel looking for a good place to grab lunch.  The building is somewhat unassuming and is shared with a beer distributor. 

The place is clean - has about 6 or 8 high-top tables on the right and another 10 or so regular tables on the left.  The bar is nice, looks great with a bunch of bottles and taps.

The beer selection was good - I went with the goose Island summer ale in a bottle. 

I ordered the wicked Reuben with fries and a side salad.  My buddy had the chicken salad sandwich with the house made chips and chili.  

The Reuben was good. It was sliced kielbasa with kraut and thousand island on a pair of potato pancakes.  I had to add a little salt as the potato pancakes kind-of dominated and were just a tad underseasoned.  Honestly though i have a bit of a salt-tooth so maybe for everyone else it will be just fine. The fries were super good and crispy - im guessing they were twice fried.    They had some remoulade on the table which was good for dipping.

The salad was super fresh and the balsamic vinaigrette was nice. 

My buddy seemed to enjoy his sandwich, chips and chili.

The service was great.  Our waitress had a great smile was very friendly and gave us some guidance with the menu.  She was quick with refills and the-like. After our food was out for a couple of minutes the chef? came out to check on us to make sure everything was ok. 

If I find myself back in the fox chapel area looking for lunch I will likely return. 

Also - excellent music playing and the sound system was really good. Not too loud but super clear."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent, but I probably won't go back because it was too noisy. And this was at 5:30 so it wasn't crowded. I had the cauliflower flatbread with veggies and homemade chips. Makes my mouth water just writing about them. My friend's quesadilla looked good too. I recommend getting some fabric in there to absorb the noise."}
{"text":"Try the spinach salad!  good bands on Friday night.  The musician engages the crowd and plays at a decibel that allows conversation to occur.  bartenders were attentive, pleasant and got our orders right.  We with certainly be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped today, 3-9-2017, at noon. and the doors were locked.  

So the one star is for being closed. 

If you're open, I'll stop back in."}
{"text":"Wicked Fox is one of the newer options in the area for casual bar-type dining and drinks. They have fairly comprehensive snack/sandwich/dinner menu and a nice draft list that is reasonably priced. Their beer prices get even better during happy hours (5-7 on weekdays) when you save $2/beer. Their food is less favorably priced (perhaps slightly too high), but it does seem to be made fresh. 

On a recent visit, I tried their mac n cheese with chicken. It was a generous portion and unique in that it was made with a cheddar gouda sauce (incidentally, their cheddar gouda sauce pops up in lots of dishes on their menu, so they must be quite proud of it). Personally, the flavor of the gouda was a bit too overpowering in the sauce for my tastes...wish it was better balanced with the cheddar. However, the mac n cheese wasn't dry (which is very important in mac n cheeses) and it had a delicious crunchy parm topping. The chicken in the dish wasn't all that great....it tasted a bit bland and processed and wasn't worth the $4 upcharge. My husband tried the \"Sloppy Fox\" sandwich, which is basically a hyped-up sloppy joe with jalapenos, tater tots, and...you guessed it...their cheddar gouda sauce. He added fries for a $1 upcharge. He reported that his sandwich was quite tasty. I pilfered a few of his fries and they were delicious...freshly cut and well-seasoned. 

I wasn't blown away by the food here, but given the reasonable drink prices and the other lackluster options in the area, it's not a bad choice. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"After leaving Newman Chiropractic office my husband & I Stopped in on a Friday for a bite & beer. Found out it was happy hour from 5-7 $2 off beer . Had the calamari for app batter nice & light. Very nice dish. My husband & I shared the fish sandwich. We both agreed it was the best fish sandwich we've had & we've had many!  To top it off they had entertainment (AJ Fronce). Great place will be back. Only one thing missing FULL PINT on tap. Maybe next time!!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!!! Great service!!  Food was spectacular!  We all loved our meal.  Highly recommend the flat breads!!  Yum!!"}
{"text":"Some very mediocre food. It was so disappointing that I can only believe the good reviews listed here are friends of the proprietor or management"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this out, but I'd really give it 2.5 stars if I could.
The ambiance is low cost bar furniture with modern art on the walls. Not that it's bad, it's clean, simple, but the style doesn't mix well with the rest of their branding. It does seem like the art may have been from local artists which is great! There was also a gentleman playing guitar, which was nice.
The service was very good. Our waiter did an excellent job giving us the low down of the menu and drinks. Which leads us into our problem area. We tried two things he recommended, the mac and cheese (with shrimp because he said we just 'had' to and the deep fried Italian rolls). We were all about the recommendations since the menu is seriously all over he board and things that could be simple were made extreme in some way.
The deep fried Italian rolls were good, you did feel yourself gaining weight, but good none the less. We were hungry so not sure if we would enjoy it as much on a normal day. Then the mac and cheese came, ugh. The 'cheese' was runny/watery and the noodles could've been cooked longer. The 4 dollar addition to add the shrimp was ridiculous for the tiny tiny shrimp. We were bummed because we wanted to love a place like this.
There is a great beer selection so we may come back for a beverage or two, but won't be eating here anytime soon. Or we will have to try something else. 
Why can't Fox Chapel have a nice local, low key, bar/restaurant?!"}
{"text":"Great food that you can tell is made from scratch daily. In particular I love the Italian rolls, the loaded tater tots, and wing sauces.

The drinks are great too, continually being updated with the season (I had a white cranberry and rosemary sangria which was good, they also offered a cinnamon red sangria). 

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is from service, they need more servers because the word is getting out on how great the food is. I hope with the busier they get, the servers there will increase but other than that there's nothing negative to say. 

Ps. Great 1/2 off appetizers happy hour and other specials offered daily!"}
{"text":"We were fans of Beer Nutz which closed a year ago for no apparent reason because they always seemed to draw a crowd.
The newly open Wicked Fox on the same premises (seems everything within 10 miles of Fox Chapel is named Fox-something-or-other even though this is in O'Hara, close to Blawnox) is missing a lot of what we liked about the old place. No gargantuan burgers and the prices seemed high for what you get, unlike Beer Nutz. More reflective of the zip code pricing prevalent in the area.
I had their Reuben, my wife had the Turkey Club. A lot of beers to choose from, yet they moved away from the previous bottle shop model by removing the long cooler that held an amazing variety of beers. Overall, less of a choice than before. Then again, with the Market District a short distance away, the new owners didn't think they could compete with carry-out six packs.
My Reuben was made without corned beef and used thinly sliced kolbassi as a substitute, with potato pancakes in place of rye and maybe half the size of the excellent huge Reuben from before. Home made chips were good. Tasty but I'd have preferred a corned beef version. Pricey for $10.
For some reason the amplified sounds from the game room came over the speaker system, as well as whatever was on the TV.
Overall, not as good as Beer Nutz was; not sure when we'll be back. Service was good but I was underwhelmed."}
