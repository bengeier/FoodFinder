{"text":"would suggest anyone to try it. I have an ex coworker who now works there. Racheal is gonna rock it."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst Greek/ Mediterranean places I've been to. Very few places out here really know how to make authentic Greek/ Mediterranean food. The first time I went here I got severe food poisoning from the chicken schwarma plate, most likely due to the meat under proper temperature and the food overall was very bland and non-appetizing. It's been months since that visit and I finally went here today to give it another shot. BIG MISTAKE! I ordered an order of hummus, falafel, and a chicken schwarma. First off, the chicken schwarma was horrible. It was like taking chicken from Taco Bell, add some shriveled tomatoes and some tahini on artificial pita bread, and you've got yourself the ideal American version of this traditional wrap. They don't even know how to make a schwarma!!! The falafel was so salty and grainy...and if you've had great falafel before, you would know that Stephano's version is just crap. The hummus had NO FLAVOR whatsoever. When hummus is made, the garbanzo beans and tahini bring out such a robust flavor all on its own when made the traditional and proper way. Everything I've tried thus far is just soooo overly processed. Eating at Stephano's is like eating at the McDonald's of the Greek and Mediterranean food genre. I will never go back again. As a matter a fact, go right around the corner to kabob express on eastern and trop. Now that place is a lot more decent, freshly-made food that won't put a hole in your wallet. I swear coming from back east and Europe, people don't really know what good food is around here. Best Lebanese place I've tried thus far here in this town? Ali Baba's. hands down. * yells at Vegas. \" go there! Go there!\"* you will not be disappointed!! :)"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time on New Year's Day for a quick dinner and it was delicious! Amazing customer service and perfect food that hit the spot, especially for a vegetarian! Great portion sizes and simple, easy atmosphere. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This was some of the best Mediterranean \"fast\" food I've ever had in the West. Casual atmosphere, friendly staff, convenient. Ask for a sampler of their sauces."}
{"text":"I used to order from Stephanos at least twice a week but not anymore! Last THREE times I ordered they messed up my order which is not very hard. Two gyro plates pita on the side. No salad. The nice guy that works the counter isn't there anymore and the new girl just doesn't get how to work the register or understand the menu. I'm on a search for a new Greek place!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time yesterday!! Absolutely delicious! I ordered the veggie kabob plate and a side of garlic paste.... Everything had so much flavor and I could barely finish the whole thing."}
{"text":"Boy oh boy, thank you all you wonderful foodies on yelp! I would never have tried this  place without you good people so thank you. I am so excited to have found this perfect Mediterranean spot and I look forward to many more visits so I can try out other menu items. I had the chicken kebob bowl and kofta a la carte and they were delicious. The Israeli salad may have been my favorite thing!"}
{"text":"The only thing I can really say about this place is that it's just okay.

The prices are pretty darn fair, and you get a decent amount of food as well. Problem is, the food is nothing to get excited over. It has a hint of authenticity, but has been extremely Americanized. The gyros were okay, and the hummus and tzatziki were passable. The pitas were far too dry and tasteless, so they served solely as a vehicle for the mediocre dips. The garlic sauce on my shawerma was very strange...I didn't hate it with a vengeance like other yelpers did, but I honestly couldn't decide if I liked it or not.

The interior was decent and cozy, but definitely had the \"college hangout\" vibe. Which is fine, of course, as long as you're okay with that. As many others mentioned, there is a hookah lounge too.

Customer service was mediocre to start, but warmed up throughout the visit.

Surprisingly, the fries were the best part: Perfectly seasoned, thick cut, and extra crispy.

I'll probably return, due to proximity and price. I'd be willing to try their wide variety of \"Low Carb Plates\" which feature double meat and lots of salad, therefore omitting the offensive pita. But I'm going to keep on the lookout for a truly good Greek restaurant. I hear Fat Greek is amazing..."}
{"text":"The second time I came here: the chicken is burnt again! Horrible. I couldn't eat it. Two pieces were raw inside, but burnt outside, and all of them were burnt so I had to rip it with my hands to avoid eating the black chicken coal! It doesn't only taste bad, it's very unhealthy!!! Seriously... The only good thing was the pita, but you don't pay $13 for having some pita with hummus... I don't know how this place got so many good reviews."}
{"text":"Four words that have changed our lives: Stephano's three dollar delivery.  
Oh yes, for just three more dollars you can enjoy delicious chicken kabobs, Israeli salad, rice, hummus and pita in the comfort of your pajamas with your dogs by your side.  It's that easy.  We eat here every week and the food is consistently fantastic.  Don't forget your garlic sauce (not for dogs.) Yummm."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Even gave me a free drink while I waited! Ill be back every time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food if your look for a decent kabob this place should be your first stop. Great service friendly staff also that baklava they sell is really fantastic it's a nice sweet sweet honey inside good crunch some of the best I have found. 

Tldr. Foods dope check in offer is dope you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Shawerma Wrap it was delicious, the chicken was seasoned just right and the wheat pita was tasty. On the other hand, a friend of mine ordered the Beef Shawerma wrap and it was a bit too salty. That said, I think It is the right amount of food for a good price. I would definitely come back here for lunch. 

If you want a quick and easy meal option I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food is overall OK. They get an additional star for the pickled goodies. Unfortunately, my kid got food poisoning from the kids steak skewer meal, so three stars  off for the complete lack of sleep that I had last night."}
{"text":"Worst Greek/Mediterranean food experience ever!  We read the menu online and placed our order accordingly. Got home and discovered very little food for the price and, in one order, no rice and only two tiny pieces of meat.  In addition to the food being sparse, it tasted terrible. When I called the restaurant, the manager was rude and uncaring and hung up on me. If you're accustomed to GOOD Greek/Mediterranean food, portions that are a meal and not an appetizer,and quality customer service, then don't go here. This was our first and last time at Stephano's.  Terrible!"}
{"text":"The food is good here, but I wish they wouldn't nickel and dime for items such as extra pita. I know other Mediterranean restaurants that give free unlimited pita, hummus,and tzatziki."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant at least eight times since they opened. I have never been disappointed. The food has always been delicious, fresh, and the quantity is more than enough for one person. The owner, Nick has always made sure our food is right. Love the atmosphere, too. Friday, I had a take out order delivered to our school. It was sent perfectly, everything as we ordered, hot and delicious. The other 7 teachers were so impressed at how wonderful everything was. I have introduced many people to Stefano's, and no one has been disappointed. So glad you opened in your new area. We love it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! And the service is fast & friendly. Loungy sofa seating in the back - great for checking in on Yelp on a piping hot Vegas afternoon!"}
{"text":"Awesome Shwarma and nice folks behind the counter. Definitely coming back! Five shtaaars!"}
{"text":"Our go to Mediterranean place.  Our usual is the Shawarma plate and the Spanakopita plate.  They come with hummus, jasmine rice, Israeli salad and four pieces of warmed pita.  Delish!  The first time we went there we got a container of garlic spread and another of tahini, but these past few times didn't include those.  The garlic one was awesome, don't know if they forgot or don't offer that anymore...bummers."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal there.  Yesterday Nov 19 my wife and I stopped in and ordered a beef and lamb gyro and a chicken gyro.  After I ordered we sat down.  After 25 minutes passed I went to the front register and told the apparent manager how long we had been waiting.  I was met with a deer in the headlights look.  I then proceeded to ask for a refund as a lady next to me said she was waiting for 30 min for her food also.  One of the staff in the back heard our complaint and rushed to bring our order out.  The manager then said,  \"no don't give it to them, they cancelled their order.\"  I was a little shocked by this but not really surprised by the initial reaction I got from the manager.  This should not have happened as at least 4 customers who ordered after us got their food within 5 minutes of placing their order.  It is not like it was busy as it was 2:10 pm when we ordered.  They had 1 person working the register and 3 or 4 in back working the food line.  It should not take almost 30 minutes to make 2 gyros.  Like I said, I have never had a bad meal there. Yesterday, I just never got a meal there.  Looks like I will be getting my gyro fix somewhere else unless something changes."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I ate so much my belly hurt and still have leftovers. I also got a free baklava. This really strange thing happened though. This guy was trying to wash the windows. The girl at the counter laughed at him and continued to look at him and laugh while taking my order. I don't know if it was because it was raining or what. Totally stank attitude. The food was pricy and the atmosphere bourgeois. It's kind of funny that because I had a phone and checked in they gave me free shit. Which is the cheapest thing on the menu btw but deliciously decadent. So in short, the food is bomb and servings large but the morality low. To keep with the Greek theme, I feel a little like persephone eating the 6 pomegranate seeds in hades."}
{"text":"The services is awesome, The food is great,  takes a bit to be made but I look at it as its fresh!! No Complaints here..."}
{"text":"I literally downloaded Yelp on my phone just now just so I could tell you all to go to Stephano's because it is the most glorious place ever! I want to bathe in the Israeli salad that they put on the side of everything! Do yourself a favor and go here for lunch!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Stephano's!  My husband and I go there at least once a week {they have a punch card - buy 9 get one free}.  We also take our friends and family there who visit us and they always comment on the food and how delicious it is!  The gyro salad is my favorite dish, along with the falafel.  The low carb plates are a great option too when we want to stick to protein and veggies.  If you haven't tried it yet, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"I come to Las Vegas frequently for work and always try to pick new places.  After my meal this evening I will always stop here!  Stephano please come to Arizona!"}
{"text":"This greek restaurant is awesome, food was delicious and delivered to our table fast which was nice because we were on our lunch break. 
The seats were comfortable and we loved the wooden set up of all the furniture, very nice. Made us feel like we were outdoors even though we were inside.
I usually don't eat hummus, I haven't liked it when I have tried it before, but theirs is really good I'm surprised how much I ate.
The chicken is mouth watering, well cooked just the way I like it, and goes perfectly with the white rice. The pita bread was big and tasted really good dipped in the cucumber sauce. The salad was good but i can't have that much spicy foods so I wasn't able to eat much of it, but my boyfriend did. Lol.
We will be going again real soon! Thank you!"}
{"text":"They have the best sorma even better than back home they very friendly and very good prices for the high quality food they serve i love this place if you like beef just try the filet mingion plate is legendary"}
{"text":"Aly or Allie is nice that's why I giving this place 3 stars. As far as the other workers they didn't acknowledged me when I walked in. As I order and pay for my food they didn't say thank you and ignore me for the most part. 
The food it was pretty decent, but the customer service needs a bit of work.


Update:  Customer service improved."}
{"text":"Stephano's consistently has great food. I used to frequent the Maryland Pkwy location but I'm not over there much anymore. Needless to say, I was happy to see they opened a location in the southwest. The food at this location is just as good as the other two. The chicken kebab is fantastic, as are the rice and Israeli salad. They also deliver and have an easy order online option. No complaints! Great food quick and at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Today was our first time trying this place.  We ordered the Gyro plate, beef swarma plate, and a couple of beef swarma rice bowls. The rice that come in all the plates is very tasty, even my husband who is a bit of a rice snob, loved it.  The beef swarma plate was plentiful, was very filling, and worth the $13 price. Both the beef swarma and beef/lamb gyro meat were delicious.  The hummus was tasty and went well with the wheat peta bread that we ordered with it.  The rice bowls were more ideal for my picky tweenagers, although they could've used a little more meat.  Also picked up a small plate of their baklava and it is the best baklava I have ever had. The whole family enjoyed their meals. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Went in for a late lunch and service was fast. The food was enjoyable. I got the gyro plate and it was way too much food for me. My favorite part was the cucumber salad. The stars are mostly because the food was good. 
I probably won't be back because the food doesn't justify the price and atmosphere for me (maybe I'd go back in if I was craving a gyro but I'd take it to go) They were playing way too loud music. It seemed to be a mix between club and Mediterranean something. It just didn't seem appropriate while I was having lunch and more like something I'd hear at a club. Also they have a lounge looking area as you walk to the bathrooms and it was very dirty. The cushions were stained and were thrown about everywhere."}
{"text":"Steak kabobs are awesome!  I had the low carb plate that comes with 4 kabobs. The steak is tender and so delicious.  Service is very friendly."}
{"text":"I gotta tell you, this place is consistently accurate with orders, helpful with menu questions and delicious. The food presentation is fantastic both in store and to go. They have a wonderful selection of Greek and Israeli beers that compliment the food well. Please walk in and grab a menu, we have used the catering platter at a party and it was a hit."}
{"text":"I am ashamed to have to type this....after being a customer of Stephano's since they opened years ago, I went and cheated on Stephano's this week. (Gasp!)  There was a \"Kabab\" place closer to my house and to work, I received a coupon in the mail, I was saving money, gas and time going to this other eatery. It was buy one get one half off, so I tried the chicken and the beef. Well, after YEARS of the best at Stephano's, I was so disappointed in the other place, I have taken a vow that from this day forward, I will always be true to Stephano's. The food NEVER disappoints, the garlic sauce is amazing, the hummus,  pita bread, rice pudding, the Moussaka, baba ghanoush, baklava, Stephano's grandmother's rice recipe are all wonderful! Even the Ultimate Grilled cheese is savory and delicious. I pray Stephano forgives my fall from grace! I promise, it will never ever happen again. Stephano's your my one true Greek love!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for many years, I remember before they expanded about 2006???... it was a small restraunt but very much  worth it and it still is! That rice is something else! Get the Kofta plate!!! Yum!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. It's the perfect place to go if you want to sit down and have a nice lunch and take your time, or in somewhat of a hurry and want a fast food type of lunch without the fast food quality of drive throughs. The food does take a little longer to come out, but that's because it's extremely fresh and cooked while you wait. I also love the staff at the locations, they are always super friendly and you can tell that they care about the food. The hummus is amazing, it has a great flavor seeing that the hummus at other Greek restaurants tend to be bland and taste the same. The Feta fries are also incredible as well but my go to is the chicken kabobs- they're always juicy and never dried out, which is usually the problem when I get chicken from places that grill it there themselves. It's clean, the price point isn't bad for the amount of food that you're getting. Great food!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Greek in town. The Schwarma and gyro meat are amazing and the Tzatziki is amazing. Simply the best Greek in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very near by resident, was very excited to have Stephano's upcoming in the neighborhood. I was there for the soft grand opening, and 3 other times since.. The food has been great each time. However, the staff has been disappointing each time. Lack of warmth/friendly and certainly not welcoming of a \"new\" place (if even in the neighborhood) nor for take out orders have the seemed to be very perceptive of \"put an extra pep in your step\" while you visibly see the customer awaiting their order. I don't consider their food to be, \"fast food\" equivalent at all, unfortunately, their service is. Perhaps I'm a bit of a stickler for, \"quality\". It's too bad, quality food can't be accompanied by a better, \"dining experience. 
Food 4 stars, Service 2."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but expected better.  We were the last customers in on a weekday and we finished before closing time, but we felt rushed.  Overall experience wasn't very pleasant."}
{"text":"Several years ago this place was VERY good...the food was fresh (although pricy) & the service was outstanding..now a days not so much..the food prices went WAY up yet the portions are ridiculously small....it's not as fresh as it was back then...service is lousy....servers act like they just hate being there....i heard that they had new owners & maybe that's why it's so shitty now.....i won't be going back which is a disappointment for me..."}
{"text":"Love this place great food and very responsible prices. I've brought many friends here and not one friend had anything bad to say about stephanos"}
{"text":"The salad was good, the Feta was amazing the pita was good but I checked in and the girl forgot my baklava dessert kinda ruined my mood"}
{"text":"Real, authentic greek food. Great quality.

With that being said, they have some of the BEST fries I have ever had. 

Everything I have had on their menu is a winner.  I eat low carb these days and there low-carb plate is SOOOOOOO good!"}
{"text":"This place offers a great array of Greek food. The hummus is spot on! The dolma is good too.
Place seemed clean, reasonable prices and friendly staff. I looked like I wasn't the only one who enjoys Greek food from time to time, because the place was bustling with people!"}
{"text":"I am a huge Greek/Mediterranean food lover so I had high expectations for this place after going to Market Grille Cafe for so long.

Walking in, I noticed immediately that the seating area was much bigger than I anticipated. Whether or not they get that busy I'm not sure, as I went around 2pm and there were only two other gentlemen eating there. Of course they play your traditional Mediterranean music which pairs well with the decor.

I placed an order ahead of time and initially planned on taking it back to work but decided to eat there instead. The man running the customer facing counter was pretty friendly and welcoming. To the left of the register I noticed a tall wall sectioned into different \"levels\" of beers; all assorted based on quality and price. I saw they had Innus and Gunn which had me perk up instantly since you'll typically find this at a liquor store only. I ordered one along with my meal but ended up disappointed as they had it displayed on the wrong shelf, expecting it to be $3.50 when in reality cost close to $5.00. When I asked about the price he replied, \"Oops, someone must have put it on the wrong shelf. Do you still want it?\" I was hoping he would have made some sort of effort to adjust the price this one time but no such luck. I went with a Blue Moon instead. This was my only negative experience since I work retail and whenever I encounter this issue I try to take care of the customer within reason.

I ordered a lamb Gyro wrap. When I called in and asked about the portion compared to a full Gyro, they said it's smaller compared to a typical Gyro but can still fill you. They were right about one thing, it definitely was filling. If this was \"small\" compared to their typical Gyro then you had better bring an appetite for a Gyro. This wrap was definitely a good size and the price was definitely generous for the amount. The meat was very tender and the hummus tasted very \"authentic\", unlike some cheap hummus you'd buy from a store. They also throw some pita bread and hummus as a side at no charge and free baklava, which was also very good, if you check in on Yelp.

I only give 5 stars to places that absolutely blow my mind. My experience was very desirable here and earned a solid 4 stars and to be honest if this were closer to home, for the price, portions and quality I'd definitely eat here over Market Grille Cafe. If you like Greek food you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love there Gyro Lamb & beef plates! Oh and the Baklava is sooooo good!"}
{"text":"They got the best chicken sandwich in town! Great Gyros especially the 
Gyro Pizza.  And they have a ridiculously great beer selection.  It's a great place to watch games because they have TVs too."}
{"text":"I had a craving for a gyro last night so I searched Yelp for any places in the area. 2 places on Maryland came up and I chose this one because of the Nutella pita and someone remarked the gyros are superior. I had a lamb and beef gyro which was very tasty! It was also pretty packed with meat so no worries there. I think avocado with their gyro would have made it the best ever! I did receive a free baklava for checking in here, so that's a big plus. I was quite let down by the fact that they no longer serve the Nutella pita, I wish I'd known. I opted for buying 2 more baklava before I left to satisfy my sweet tooth. I'm sure I'll eat here again, although I'd still love that Nutella pita! Now where can I find a one in Vegas? Help!"}
{"text":"Excellent service followed by even better food. The gyro bowl exceeded my expectations and the baklava is second to none. Servings are respectable and the price is fantastic.  I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"The food was astounding and reasonably priced. I had the shrimp kebab and I loved it! The atmosphere is nice as well with good music playing."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food Greek-Mediterranean place to eat. One of my favorite Greek places overall. I eat there every week. Everything I have had is very good. But my favorite is the filet mignon plate. I always dine in and the place is kept very well. If I had to find faults I would say the staff  is professional  but not exceptionally friendly. Also if you are looking for true fast food this may not be the place as average wait time is about 15 minutes when they're not busy."}
{"text":"worst falafel, la atención excelente !!! Pero para ser un rest de comida griega !! No lo recomiendo .. Lo único es el pollo !! Pero quien no sirve un poco sabroso ??"}
{"text":"Amazing! I never really loved Greek food but this place was highly recommended by a friend so we tried it. My husband and I were incredibly impressed by how good the food was. The restaurant itself is nothing to look at but man, the food is fantastic! Going back very soon!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  Good menu selection and good food.  A fast food style with authentic Greek food.  Food takes longer than a typical fast food place, but well worth the wait.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time here and it totally hit the spot!  I opted for the two item combination plate and got chicken and steak as the protein. Attacked the chicken first and mmm.  Citrus and spices galore!  The rice is on top of tasted like my mom's rice so it filled my heart with joy. The Israeli salad is my new obsession. I think I'll dream about it tonight. They provided two whole, warned pitas with the meal and it was more than enough. The hummus was fine, I'm not an expert, though.  Being Latina, I need some spice in my life so picked up some homemade pickled jalapeños. Tasty but not spicy. But really, that Israel salad though..."}
{"text":"I am so happy with the food and service I recently received from Stephano's grill. I was in Las Vegas last weekend for a bachelorette party and was looking for a good catering option that would deliver to the strip. Stephano's came through! I set up a meal delivery for 12 hungry girls at the Signature at MGM and they were awesome! We got the lamb/beef meat which was AMAZING as well as Hummus, salad and rice. The portions were extremely generous and they threw in a TON of extra pita! We had leftovers the entire weekend. Everyone I talked to over there was very helpful and the customer service was excellent. They delivered the food as promised, on time and threw in extra Pita bread and all of the utensils and plates. I would highly suggest them for your catering needs in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Loved the food, good service and great price. The menu is fantastic with many options for everyone."}
{"text":"The food at Stephano's is so authentic and I think is very reasonably priced.  We ordered the gyro plate (a beef and lamb plate) $13.00 and there is plenty of food for 2 meals.  The meat is cooked authentically and the plates come with rice, Israeli salad, delicious rice, a generous portion of hummus and 2 pieces of pita bread.  It comes with a side of tzatziki sauce as well. I highly recommend Stephano's and if you're pressed for time, they have delivery as well as online ordering.  They are even open on Sundays which is hard to find when seeking Greek/Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Great food for decent price. Good ambiance in the dining are. Really like the cushioned benches in the back. Good beer selection too!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's nearby the house and seems to find a way into our diet at least once a week-- I come often enough that the cashier noticed my haircut. Everything I've gotten here is tasty, though I'm on a kick with the Chicken Slavaki wrap with extra Tziki sauce (pardon my misspellings). I cannot go in here without taking home a tray of baklava--my fave. Can't go wrong with Stephano's, glad to have you as a staple in our life!"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday and totally loved this place. The guy at the register was totally nice and explained a few dishes to us. The food was amazing. Flavors popped and was well rounded. We sat in the back of the restaurant with all the comfy pillows. I think every restaurant should have this kind of seating. Totally recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas. You will dig on it."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Best shawrama in southern Nevada! The food is fresh, the service is friendly, and the garlic sauce is amazing!! You won't be disappointed at all! Give them a shot!"}
{"text":"I have been to Stephanos many times for lunch and never have I been disappointed. 

The restaurant is always clean and often busy, but without a failure in service.  

Tonight I also checked in via Yelp and recieved a free piece of baklava for dessert. Which a co-worker woofed down with a smile on his face.

Tonight I chose the #8 combination plate with Chicken kabob and shrimp kabob. The plate came with rice, greek salad, a nice portion of humus and I opted for whole wheat pita, which was delicious!  

It usually takes a little longer than one would hope for lunch, but the food is quality and worth the extra wait. Be sure to order on the same ticket, if eating at the same time is preferred.  For my group,  that's not a problem,  we eat as we are served, with no complaint. 

I will always recommend Stephanos to anyone looking for a healthy eat spot near UNLV. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stephano's is a hard place to find. It is a bit back from the road in a strip mall across from UNLV on Maryland Parkway. If you know where the Post Office is in the 4600 block of Maryland Parkway you are just a few feet away. Just look a bit to the left for the sign above the door. When you walk in you see the counter to order and pick up your food and a few dozen tables for seating. Their sign says that they have been open since 1998. I asked Stephano's son if they have been in the same location since 1998 and he informs me yes. They did expand in 2006 by renting out the space next to them though. I would not say there is much in the way of decor. There are just tables to sit at and not much more.

For my first time there I decided to go with the Rib Eye Steak Shawerma Sandwich. This comes wrapped in a Pita with the steak, tomatoes, onions, and tahini sauce. The combo also included fries and a drink. I thought the steak was prepared very nicely. It was full of flavor, very tender and chewed well. I was very impressed with the pita that enclosed the sandwich. This is not like any pita I have ever had before. Most other pita I have had in the past has been mostly like other bread. This pita was dense, very flavorful and had a whitish tint to it. It also had a nice char on it from the grill. I have never had tahini sauce before. I found out that it is a paste made from sesame seeds. It is very smooth, but does not have a lot of flavor. The smoothness did add a pleasing texture to the sandwich as a whole. The fries were nice and crispy. They had a great flavor to them as well."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch a lot and I always get the beef and lamb low-carb plate. It's my favorite!"}
{"text":"One of my favs!  Found this place through groupon and have been going ever since.  Everything I have tried is super yummy!  In fact, we love this place so much, we have used them for catering for the past 4 years for our annual Halloween party.  Our guests always rave about the food and selection and I don't have to cook!  It's a win-win.  Their gyro and shawerma bowls are awesom and they have the best rice.  I normally won't eat rice when eating out but I love theirs.  The selection is great and they have something for everyone, including my vegan friends.  Staff is always nice and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"Dis shit was hella fuckin' good! Only been once, but will definitely go back again. Seemed expensive, but when my lamb and beef gyro plate arrived, it was basically two meals. Meat had a charred, smokey taste and the tzatziki was rich and savory. Most places I go it's too sour and runny. Plus, they give you as much of it as you want. I gave it four stars until I go back and order something different. If the next thing and order is awesome, it will get another star!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Mediterranean food in town. Pleasant service. Easy parking. Nice clean facilities. And of course, the most important part: awesome food! They don't skimp. Great portion sizes full of flavor and a variety of ingredients. And the food tastes clean, you know what I mean? No gross, greasy afterfeel. Just well-cooked and clean. I always get the salad with some type of beef, and they pack the salad with plenty of meat, vegetables, olives, and feta cheese. I say that, because I don't like it at other places when you order a salad, and you basically get a big bowl of lettuce with a sprinkle of meats and toppings. Nope, not here. The salads here are great. My husband always gets a combo plate. Everything on the combo plate is delicious too. The portion sizes are so big that we always have leftovers to take home and eat later that day."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Vegas.
Atmosphere is nice.
Nice selection of alcoholic drinks. 
Food is filling but, not greasy. Price is good. 
What's not to love.
They have delicious fries too."}
{"text":"First time visit. Made the decision based on Yelp ratings. Great little spot. Many offerings. Had the Gyros bowl. (gyros meat, rice, Israeli salad--finely chopped onion, tomato and cucumber in vinegar, pita on the side). Well done. I like that they offer white or wheat pita. If it was whole wheat that would be awesome. Baklava was tasty. More cinnamon and less honey then I'm used to. They add crushed pistachios. They have an outdoor patio that is dog friendly. They have 2 TVs mounted on the wall.  Showing football at the time. Beer and wine coming soon. Prices typical. Clean. Cool lighting and seating. I love on the other side of the valley but would definitely go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Got expensive,babaganush it's all the time have big big chunks of eggplants ,salad sometimes not fresh"}
{"text":"I ordered a combo plate for take out. One was warm and fresh, the other which was kefta we cold. I guess they forgot to heat it.... Had to microwave it to be eatable. 

I called and told the manager and he said that's not possible because they make everything fresh. I don't know what his idea of fresh is but for me taking it out of the frig to reheat and serve is not fresh.... Nor did I appreciate the cold food for my $25 lunch order.

Excuses excuses... Unless the salad the meat was sitting on was an ice salad the meat being cold all the way to the center just doesn't happen. I don't cook, I do take out quite frequently. You think this takeout was something original causing some extraordinary circumstance... May have been fresh off the grill in their heads, who knows. It was still cold. I don't repeat places where \"fresh\" food has to be mircowaved and managers make excuses for it. Thanks for the offer I guess."}
{"text":"Parking is a little crowded because it's in the Smiths grocery center, but it's not bad if you have to park by Smiths and walk over. Keep in mind it's Super Bowl Sunday so it's probably just busy anyways. Place is very clean and service is fast. I got the beef gyro and chicken shawrma pita to go. Yum! Bakalava is available in trays to go. Whoop whoop!"}
{"text":"After looking through various options for dinner, we decided to try out this Mediterranean place. I love spices and flavorful food and this place did not disappoint. 

We got the chicken shawarma and beef & lamb gyro plates as well as the lamb shank rice bowl. It was so much food! Everything was delicious. They give you a big serving of hummus and salad with the plates. I've had gyros in Greektown of Chicago a handful of times and I'd say the meat is comparable, if that helps at all.

Because I checked in, we got free baklava and I don't know if it usually comes in two's but they gave us two baklavas cut in half since we had four people. I was honestly expecting just one but it was nice that they did that. :)"}
{"text":"This place has made Mediterranean food my new favorite! I could live off their chicken kebob plate. So good."}
{"text":"never been disappointed here. salads are excellent. not fast food, they put an effort into the preparation. plus it is close to where I live!"}
{"text":"I ordered the gyro combo. The guy behind the counter was rude with no personality whatsoever. It came out to $9.99. The gyro was burnt, dry, and chewy almost like a beef jerky! How do you mess up a gyro?  I only took a couple of bites and I had enough! I only ate the fries which was the only good thing. I don't even want to give it one star because it was the worst gyro I've ever had. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I am hooked on the babaganoosh and tzatziki. This is my second day in a row ordering. Today I stocked up for late night healthy snacking.  Keep up the great job!"}
{"text":"Staying in vegas and ordered for delivery.
Oh my had the rib eye shawarma sandwich and it was absolutely amazing! I had the fries sauce on the side and used it with the sandwich and I'm still licking my lips. Def stopping by there tomorrow and gettign 2 of those sandwiches.

I'm from Michigan, home of largest Middle Eastern pop outside of the Middle East and had my share of shawarma. This is IT!"}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food! Tender meat full of flavor, housemade sauces, amazing rice, veggies, salad, pitas - seriously, everything is top notch! Great relaxing atmosphere. Love it!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal Mediterranean food! Much more than just gyros! Got the combination plate with grilled veggie and chicken kebabs - everything was melt in your mouth flavor. All sauces are house made and amazing, also love the house made turnips and pickled jalapeños. Hot and fresh made wheat pitas and rice were great too. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"If I was local I would eat here at least once a week.  Super fresh ingredients/food, chicken shawarma wrap and hummus are both incredible!"}
{"text":"Gyro was awesome. I really loved the cucumber salad that came with the plate. Hummus was mediocre."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!!! I never review but have to the food we had on delivery was outstanding !! Simply delicious the meat , rice , whole wheat pita perfection !! Even their packaging for delivery is great . The chicken so good Cant wait to order again ."}
{"text":"I would eat here when Stephano's was Daily Chicken and I still eat here when I can. They give you so much food; the greek salad and the vegetarian platter could be enough for two people. This place went from a little deli to a cute restaurant with great atmosphere. The quality of the food has remained the same. The owners are extremely sweet, the food is filling, they have a great beer selection (yay Okocim!) AND they have black currant juice! (among other Bulgarian boxed juices...This can usually only be found in Europe or European delis) I will always have a special place in my heart for Stephano's."}
{"text":"The food was fairly good for our first visit, although the humus was bland. For the money you get decent sized portions. The seating is awful and the overall atmosphere is routine. One annoyance is (if you're eating in) when they bring you your food they don't give you utensils, you have to hunt them down yourself over by the drink dispenser. Would try it again for a grab and go lunch but won't be dining in again."}
{"text":"Awful!!!  Ordered the chicken Shawarma Gyro and hated it!  It tasted very fishy.  Don't know why but with every bite it got worse.  The gyro was also missing yummy Tzatziki sauce.  Maybe they make theirs differently but trust me it needed it.  Mine came with a tiny bit of some brown stuff, and no it wasn't hummus.  

That was another thing, their hummus was um, okay nothing spectacular.  The only thing I enjoyed was their service and fries.

Not planning on returning."}
{"text":"We tried out different dishes and we're delighted. Expect to spend some time waiting for your order to be brought to you, but it's well worth the wait. Excellent food, and fresh!"}
{"text":"Ordered the same each of 6 or so visits, the Gyro, it's ok but I'm not impressed..... One or two itty bitty pieces of tomato, meat ok, but I've lived in Germany and know a good gyro"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, & great service for UNLV students! Delicious flatbreads, chicken, & baklava! If you are near the University, I definitely recommend stopping by. It's right across Maryland Pkwy"}
{"text":"Great food!  The baklava is soft and sooo delicious!  A must try!"}
{"text":"First and foremost they deliver and at a very low cost. We had three kabob meals. Chicken, steak, and vegetable. All came with plenty of sides. Everything was fresh and hot. Delivery was fast and friendly. Price is right. This place is fantastic and no doubt we will be enjoying many more meals from here."}
{"text":"Service and food was mediocre.  There are much better Mediterranean options in the area.

- Menu item listed \"moussaka\" no longer served.
- Register defaulted tips start way too high.
- Food was brought out to us without utensils.
- The free baklava for check in was forgotten.  I had to ask for it on the way out.
- Food was just ok for me."}
{"text":"If you like Greek & Mediterranean food you'll  love this place.   The people are always friendly,  the place is immaculate, most importantly some of the best Greek  I've ever had."}
{"text":"i really wanted to like this place.  The reviews were good, the pictures looked yummy, so...when it came down to it, I ordered a gyro plate, I think they call it.  The good first: the hummus was out of this world great and they gave me two full-sized pita breads to enjoy it with.  I don't often leave bread uneaten, but these were two good-sized pieces of pita and I just couldn't finish them, even with the outstanding hummus.  But I came for the gyro meat, because it looked so good on the website and the reviews.  It looked moist and freshly cut off the spit.  Unfortunately, the reality this night in Las Vegas was that it was bone dry and frankly a little burnt while trying to reheat it.  Yuk!  I've had much better gyro meat from street vendors!  Service was good and friendly but someone was cutting corners and trying to use yesterday's gyro meat to serve today's customers.  Again, yuk!"}
{"text":"great and healthy Greek and regional specialty food. great for someone who is on a primarily protein diet. makes my mouth water writing about it. Very fresh ingredients, good and friendly service and fresh food made to order. I am a regular."}
{"text":"We were at a nearby bank and starving for lunch. Yelp search turned this place up, so we walked over. I had the #6 (chicken shawerma) and my wife had #10 (chicken kebab). We got the free baklava with our yelp check in. HOLY CRAP this was the best Greek food we've had. I also had an Innis &Gunn beer. The garlic sauce that came with the food was perfect with the hummus. Great food, great service. This place is one of those places you MUST try!!"}
{"text":"I am a regular customer at stephanos I come in a lot but there is this young Mexican girl with hickies all over her neck she needs to be professional about this we don't need to see marks on her neck I love the cashiers and cooks. please talk to this employee and tell her is not professional at all to show up to work with hickies is embarrassing. I saw this about 2 weeks ago."}
{"text":"Yeah this place sucks. I just walked in there asked if they had shwarma, the sassy lady who just walked up from the back and poorly rinsed her hands answered NO with the worst attitude. At this point things got pretty awkward so i asked my friend if she wanted to go somewhere else.  Every second after that the cashier stared at us as if i murdered her baby. She kept staring as we walked out. HELL NO. LEARN TO DO BUSINESS."}
{"text":"I love this place, many, many lunches here when my office was nearby. Usually got the 1/2 chicken meal. The baba ganoush  and hummus are excellent and very fresh. I found the chicken kabobs a little dry, but the beef and lamb was very good. I need to get back here soon!"}
{"text":"Coming from a Greek/Middle Eastern background, this food hit close to home. I was very impressed with my Beef Shawerma plate and side of fries with their in house \"secret fry sauce\". 

The restaurant had recently remodeled their furniture to give it a modern look. Staff was very attentive, knowledgable, and helpful with any questions I had. 

Thank you for making this a wonderful dining experience for me; keep up the good work and I hope to return soon for this wonderful feel good food!"}
{"text":"I debated between 4 and 5 stars but the baklava earned the 5th star. The guy behind the counter said they make it. If they do they deserve an award. 

Tri tip shwarma was very good and the hummus was also great. 

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I had #11 Steak Kabobs and that was the most tender filet I have ever had. Even compared to high end steak houses. It almost melted in your mouth. Everything else was great as well."}
{"text":"I love going to this place for an easy, healthy lunch or dinner. I've had most of their plates and so far there isn't one I don't like.

The atmosphere is casual, and the music is relaxing. Seems to be a popular place with students and faculty of unlv. I'd definitely recommend it if you're in the area and interested in Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"The food is amazing at Stephanos. I am so happy that they opened a location close to my office. I eat at Stephanos at least 2 to 3 times a week. Everything is very fresh and delicious.

They have so many excellent choices, my favorite meals are the filet mignon steak kebab plate, the chicken kebab plate, and the kofta plate. The great thing about their plates is that they come with so many excellent side choices. You can get a delicious and healthy Israeli or Greek salad as one of your sides. There aren't many places around my office where you can find great tasting salads. Their salads are very fresh and I need all the vegetables I can get. 

I prefer to get their fries as my second side choice. Their fries are amazing! Better than any other place that serves fries! Get the fries and their secret fry sauce, you will come back wanting more! 

One thing I love about their location is that they take online orders through their website. This saves me so much time during my lunch break. I can order online and as soon as I get to their restaurant the food is ready for me. The service is 5 star every time I am here. The owner and the staff make sure that the food and the experience is excellent every time."}
{"text":"I gave this place a try the other day.  I ordered the spinach pie plate, which comes with a spinach pie, 2 stuffed grape leaves, Israeli salad, hummus and two pieces of pita bread.  

The food was good, no doubt.  Unfortunately, I came at a busy lunch time, and they either lost my receipt or forgot my order.  A complimentary bowl of soup (mushroom and garlic) and the calm and polite staff turned this experience to a four-star visit.  

I do wish that the FOH or the menu gives customers warning about the length of time the spinach pie takes to cook, I would have ordered something else."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here. Great food, nice people who work there, casual atmosphere, good prices. If you get a gyro bowl, you can eat half and save half for later. The garlic chicken sandwich is SO garlicy, it's great. I come here weekly!"}
{"text":"Tuesday night @ 6:45. Took 35 minutes to get a gyro and falafel salad. Other customers that walked in 15 to 20 minutes after us got there food at the same time we got our food. My gyro was luke warm. Falafel was dried out. Would have not tipped in the tip jar at the register if I knew how long it would take. I wanted to take my tip back out of the jar."}
{"text":"got the number 6. I was disappointed with the food. it was semi warm, it just wasnt flavorful.
the hummus was decent tho.  I felt ripped off with the price, 10 bucks for this? NO THANKS. Not going back"}
{"text":"I wish I would have found this place earlier. Delicious mediterranean food, for a good price considering the amount you get, but the best part of the experience - the incredible ambience! In the back part of the restaurant, the sitting are hass tons of pillows and is decorated like it was just meant for you to lay down and fall asleep. Very comfy, and the music is always easy listening, acoustic,  singer/songwriter type stuff, except better than Starbucks.

Treat yourself to an Israeli salad. You'll be glad ya did."}
{"text":"For our first trip into this University area eatery my Wife and i tried appetizer Spinach Pie. We then moved on to Pasticcio (Greek Lasagna) and a Pork Souvlaki plate. Topped off with big cups of \"Tropical Passion\" Iced Tea.

The spinach pie was a good sized portion for an appetizer. It was warm, very crispy pastry and a nice spinach mixture layered within. I tasted the spinach, a hefty cheese, and maybe even some nutmeg. I liked the taste.

My Wife's Pasticcio was served in an rectangular aluminum baking tin. It was browned nicely on top. Breaking in to the concoction she found it hot and bubbly, a lot of ground beef, a heavy béchamel sauce, layered with pasta. The smell was wonderful. Her comment, \"I am going to be so full when I am done with this\".

My Souvlaki plate was hot, loaded with a nice bed of white rice, two skewers of grilled pork, Hummus, Israeli Salad, and two pitas cut in half. There were five thick, well grilled, and juicy pieces of pork on each skewer. The Israeli Salad was a chopped mixture of cucumber, tomato and onion. It was spiced well so there was a bit of a background \"nip\". The Hummus was thick and flavorful. it was just as I like it. I can see myself with a load of bagel chips and a bowl of it while watching TV. 

OK, 1/2 a pita folded, a good spoonful of some very good Tzatziki sauce, a spoonful of Israeli Salad, and two or three pieces of pork. Wrap it all together and open wide to enjoy these absolutely wonderful mixing of flavors. I was in love with a food again.

By the way. the Tzatziki was filled with chopped onion and cucumber in a thick Greek Yogurt. This was the real crowning touch to these little sandwich rolls I made.

The prices here are really reasonable. Expect to see a lot of College students. I would expect that this is a real good stop for them. Hearty food, Great Taste, and well within the College Student price line.

They have a great assortment of very interesting off brand beers. I watched a couple guys drinking a real nice looking dark beer. I think that a cold beer may be in the order when we show up here again, soon."}
{"text":"i tried the garlic chicken sandwich, lentil rice, and small humus plate. The flavors were fantastic! The garlic was not over powering, nice smokey flavor in the humus, which I found went so well with the sandwich. It came with fries, which were nice and crunchy with a nice tomato aioli to dip in. The rice had a good flavor, not yo heavy and very satisfying.  I ended it with a piece of baklava, which I must say highlighted the entire meal. The baklava was sweet, buttery, flaky, and had such a great texture to bite into.  I left full and happy."}
{"text":"usually love this place.  tonight we ordered 3 plates... mine was fine but it took way too long.  there were maybe 7 or 8 tables of guests... perhaps lots of pickups, don't know.   

my husbands order of gyro and fries was cold and the tiniest amount of gyro meat I've ever seen!  usually there's almost too much meat... so of course he's unhapppy.

my daughter ordered a chicken/ filet mignon combo plate, and the steak tasted \"perfumy\" or chemically...not good.my plate was fine.

I hope this was an exception, and I know it will be a long time before my family trusts enough to try again.  

boohoo!"}
{"text":"the best place for lunch around unlv

gyros and falafel are specialties

i usually go for the vegetarian combo
(grape leaves, spinach pie, falafel, pita, tabouleh, etc.........)

fast & friendly service, too!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, friendly service. Amazing food. Had the chicken shawarma plate, gentleman offered to substitute any of the sides for baba ganoush for ultimate food victory. Great selection of Mediterranean beers if you want to stick to the theme.  Eat here or perish."}
{"text":"Overall I was a bit underwhelmed by most of the food. The moussaka didn't have much texture to it and the seasonings seemed a bit off. The feta fries weren't impressive either. But the saving grace was the gyro! The meat was thick cut and seemed to be grilled, which was fantastic! The bread was perfect and the taziki sauce was great. Probably the best gyro I have ever had!!! I will be back to get an gyro"}
{"text":"Gyro combo is good; heavy on the onions, though.  Wifey doesn't like onions, so she picked them out.  Salads are very good - I usually get the chicken shwarma or gyro salad.  Olives are tasty, but contain pits, so be careful."}
{"text":"Awesome Customer Service, Outstanding Food! A must to try, wowza. Yelp it for a free piece of Baklava ."}
{"text":"Baklava and fries notable.  I wasn't a huge fan of the hummus.  I would stop by again if in that part of town. If you are in Henderson you gotta hit up the Great Greek."}
{"text":"came here saturday night,craving for some chicken kebabs n hummus..we found this chill place right across UNLV prices are decent and the food is very good! i think the best I've ever had.I wish it was served on ceramic plates tho instead of plastic.But all in all very good!
its not very easy to find tho so keep your eye on the commercial centers"}
{"text":"We've been here several times now and we love it every time. Authentic and delicious Greek and Mediterranean food, everything we've tried is delicious - gyro plate, kabab, souvlaki, tsasiki sauce, pita bread, hummus, YUM!  This restaurant has become our weekly dinner. Being new to Vegas, I didn't think I would find good, Greek food in Vegas but I am so happy we found Stephano's. Love!"}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food for an economical price and it's only 15 minutes from the house.  Lots of choices on the menu and we have been impressed with the spanakopita and dolmades...not to mention the feta fries.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had a craving for a good Kofta Pita Wrap & Tzatziki sauce. My friend recommended Stephano's she said because of their good wraps, plates & salads. 

Ordered a Meal with the Kofta Wrap, French Fries came with the secret fry sauce & a drink. Also ordered a side Tzatziki sauce (no charge) & 1 Baklava for dessert! 

The Kofta wrap was very good! The meat seasoned very well. The fries tasty & crispy just the way I like it. The secret fry sauce was an added bonus. The Tzatziki sauce was on point. The Baklava was a nice sweet treat. Everything was made just right surely satisfied my craving. 

For sure I'll be back. Definitely worth checking out they have a lot on the menu to choose from."}
{"text":"Where do I begin from the original location on  Eastern till now the food has just been getting better I'm glad they opened up near my house this is definitely a go to stop Mouth watering food oh you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood on my drive home  from work stopped by here since im very familiar with there other location and must I say wow same consistency everything tasted phenomenal keep up the good work must I say all of their locations are very clean in a restaurant that's a big plus thank you!"}
{"text":"I love this place so hard!!
All of their food is freaking awesome! I could eat pounds of their Israeli Salad!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful service. I just moved here and a friend introduced me to this place. It is worth checking out if you want great food at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering from Stephano's for years now and I must say that the food is always fresh and delicious! I've only been to their Maryland location once so I'm not too keen on their in-store service, but I can say that they offer fast delivery. My coworkers have never complained! I am a fan of the Chicken Kebabs and their hummus and I can't wait to try their Nutella Pita!

Kudos for the website update! Love all the pictures and interactive menu. Glad to see you guys are doing great and congrats on the new location!"}
{"text":"So I am fortunate enough to live close by to grab takeout Friday to bring home. That was a good thing because every table in the place was filled. I ordered a gyro wrap with feta cheese and small feta fries. I could swear that they gave me a large by mistake. There were so many fries in the container i had to have my son help me eat them and we still didnt finish. They were pretty good with just the right amount of cheese. Gyro sandwich was good, i thought the meat was charred in a few places and wasn't as tender as i would have liked. Meal with a drink ran me about $13.00. I would definitely come back to try to eat inside the establishment, as I've noticed that with Greek food it's not quite as delicious as eating it at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Greek Food in Town!!!! 

The service is great and the hummus is out of this world. I've tried Greek food all over town and this is absolutely the best. My mother and I never agree on food (or anything else) but we both absolutely loved this place.

The only thing that bothered is the music was super loud and and a little too authentic. Ugh, I felt like I was trapped in My Big Fat Greek Wedding."}
{"text":"Was so excited to think I was going to get Greek delivered to my house.  BUT, I dropped $30.00 for just one entree and delivery fee and tip.  $30 is a little excessive for just one person's food.  But ok, that happened, I moved on.  So at least for $30 it will be so delicious that I wont care that I am cheap.  

But in the end, meh, it was just ok.... Will never eat here again.  Super bummed.  I think $5.00 is a tough sell when its just for one person."}
{"text":"Beware of this employee name \"mariza\". Very bad attitude and very unprofessional. She must have hate her life/job. Could not trust her handling your food, who knows she will spit on your food.

Better off going to other greek resto, im sure theres better staff/food. I feel sorry for the restaurant owners but need to address bad employee issue."}
{"text":"Sadly there aren't enough decent Mediterranean restaurants near me. This is usually my go to as the food is decent. My problem with this place is that they tend to skimp on food, it's priced on the higher side for what you get and usually don't have 1/2 a chicken (which is their best deal and tastiest dish). I've been here about 6 times now and each time I have to settle for something I don't want because they don't have anymore or they need cook some more and that would take over 30 minutes. 

Today I tried to be smart and call in ahead of time to order this scarce and sacred dish. But once again I'm disappointed. No one answered. So I figured whatever I'll try my luck again. Sadly even more disappointed when the lady at the counter once again rejected my desire to have this elusive Stephano's chicken. Pissed off I went to In and Out instead where they don't disappoint."}
{"text":"This is my first visit & I decided to go with the gyro platter. Huge portions and you are given the choice of wheat or white pita bread. The food was served hot & fresh. This is a quick serve casual restaurant and appears to be a very popular spot for lunch. The food was pretty good and I'll definitely come back to try a few of the other menu items. If you stop in for lunch (prior to 3 PM) your drink is included with any of the platters. It's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Delicious! I'm new to the neighborhood and stopped in for convenience. Owner/manager was very friendly and helpful. Surprisingly great selection of beers. Delicious food!! My Greek salad with veggie kabob was voluminous, fresh, perfect. Chicken shawarma plate was awesome. Free baklava for checking in! I'll be back-- probably way too often."}
{"text":"Great lentil rice side with the veggie plate. The hummus is good and the grilled veggies were cooked well. Little heavy on the marinade but no true complaints. Busy place at lunchtime which is always a great sign. The meat kebab was also great. Good texture and not over cooked."}
{"text":"We love Stephanos! Quick place to get a meal that hasn't been deep-fried ;-)

Our favorite is anything with the grilled chicken. My one exception to the deep-fried is the feta fries, and yes, you must get them! Don't skip this!!

We like to call ahead and have it ready for pick-up. Easy to get to, and they have a rewards program where they remember your order and preferences.

They're good about modifications and substitutions, but they have forgotten our pita bread on multiple occasions. They still get 5-stars though."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and super fresh! You can never go wrong coming here and the baklava is also amazing!"}
{"text":"Everything is amazing, delivery is great, prices are great, and the food is awesome!

I love eating here."}
{"text":"Solid, authentic Greek Mediterranean grill.  They have a lot of your Greek favorites: Gyros, Chicken (Almost like Zankou Chicken from Cali), Souvlaki, Hummus, Baklava...etc. Happy that this Henderson location opened since it pains me to drive to the UNLV area to get some good gyros."}
{"text":"Love their chicken kabob salad and hummus. Typically they take 45 minutes to deliver but recently it took almost 2 hours because they had a catering job the same day. But this has only happened to me once."}
{"text":"So I've been coming here for quite some time and it is absolutely my favorite Mediterranean food in Henderson. But, I've noticed the chicken kabob meat pieces are much smaller than many months ago. I've been noticing this my last couple visits. Sad to change a great meal like that. Bring back the bigger pieces of chicken please."}
{"text":"I figured i'd write a review on the restaurant since there's not that many. I ordered a Gyro after drinking for a bit (yeah that 151 was rough....) and honestly, it was the best Gyro I have ever had. On numerous occasions I've ordered Gyro's in the past and they just didn't taste fresh. Whether it was the vegetables, the meat, the flatbread etc. Here? Everything was fresh and hot. The lamb was amazing. And the portion is a good side. 

The decoration is pretty good. They have TV's and the diner has a very rustic charm to it. They also serve beer and wine so you can get that fix if you want. 

Price was about 8 bucks per Gyro so it's a little pricey but you can taste the quality. Better to spend an extra 3$ on something that's done right than be a cheap skate and get a average to meh Gyro. 

The only downside is that it's a little small in the inside but you should be able to get a seat. Overall it's a great little place to check out."}
{"text":"The Filet Steak Kabob plate was fantastic!  The meat was marinated, perfectly cooked, tender and tasty.  The plate came with two generous skewers of filet meat on a bed of rice, Israeli salad (diced tomatoes and cucumbers in a tangy vinaigrette), hummus, and pita bread.  This plate was big enough to share, but I didn't because it was all so good.  Everything was flavorful. There was plenty of seating and they have a pet friendly patio.  I will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"Got the Shwarma Chicken greek salad. They are very sparse on the meat. It was like I paid $11 for mostly lettuce and tomato. Tasted good I guess, and it came out fast (less than 2 min), but it was incorrect. When I mentioned I asked for no onions, the guy responded that it was not on the ticket, but did fix it. By all means, try it out if its close to you. Maybe the actual shwarmas/ plates have more meat. I don't know. I'll look keep looking for other greek places though."}
{"text":"Never again in my life will I step foot into this restaurant. I placed my order online and when I arrived there was a customer in front of me placing an order. There were four other girls behind the counter, goofing around and not one asked if I needed help. As I started to observe what they were doing, they were holding trays of dessert. I believe it was the baklava. They put the trays down and now imagine you were going to take a bite of something, but didn't. These girls put their mouths to the food to \"pretend\" to take a bite and the other girl was taking pictures w her iPhone. DISGUSTING!!!!!!! People are going to eat this food that you've now had your breath on. I didn't want to make a scene in the restaurant so when I left I called and asked for a manager. Selena was the manager and I asked if she was just up at the front or was in the back. She said she was in the back. So I explained what I witnessed and she said \"I don't think they would handle the food like that.\" Hi Selena, welcome to the convo because I JUST saw this with my own eyes and suggested she watch cameras if they have. I told her I would never be back because of this incident and Selena could of cared less. For a worker to put their mouths close to any food that anyone is going to eat is beyond disgusting and never mind a health code violation. NEVER, EVER AGAIN! I give this place zero stars!"}
{"text":"Just ate here, and the food was great!  Had a chicken breast gyro with tziatki instead of garlic sauce and 2 pieces of falafel....yummm.  I am so full my heart beating hard, but it was worth it.  I'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food I've had outside of New York. Great quality. Their shawarma sandwich is amazing. The Israeli cucumber salad is outstanding. I don't know what is in their French fry sauce but it's so good. It's a little on the pricey side (expect to spend $10-15 for lunch), but it's so worth it."}
{"text":"My roommate and I used to order from here all the time, it was AMAZING!  I decided to try them again tonight (haven't ordered from them in awhile after a delivery mishap) and I am so disappointed. We always order the same thing, 2 chicken shawerma salads and an order of fries. The salads came with no dressing and the fries were unbelievably salty and soggy. What happened guys? I will not be going back and also recommending to my family a few other Greek restaurants. I just paid $35 for salads with no dressing and fries that are too salty to eat. They raised their prices but lowered their standards :("}
{"text":"Food is great! Love the schwarma wraps and their fries a awesome. The biggest issue is their service. It takes forever to get your food, even when they are not busy at all. They have the product, but they need to step it up on the service and how fast they bring the food to you. I have been here several times and it takes as long as a traditional sit down restaurant. I am writing this review as I am waiting for my food and it has already been ten minutes."}
{"text":"Had a hankerin for a little Med food, so the wife and I thought we would check out a local place down the street. 
Pat myself on the back with this one, with a little help from the Yelpers of course.
Don't expect much in the way of ambience, but who care when the food is this good...right?
We both had the lamb shank combo which comes with humans, home made wheat pita (wife had the white pita) and med salad!! Of course I had to get a side of tabbouleh.
The entire meal kicked butt! Meat falling off the bone, rice perfect, humans amazing and the tabbouleh....perfect!! And they deliver!!!
We WILL be back!!!"}
{"text":"OMG!! My first time here & I loved the house made pickled jalapeño pepper and radishes - very spicy and flavorful. The restaurant is superbly clean with beautiful and contemporary decor (not to mention the splendid painting on the wall!). The food is delicious, fresh, and high-quality! :) :)"}
{"text":"Awesome greek food! Finally something Greek for Henderson to be proud of! Awesome greek salads and gyro! Ordered my 5 year old pizza, fries, hummus and pita - loved it!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Groupon and wow!! I'm a student at UNLV so it's super convenient, but the food is really the key. Was never a fan of gyros until theirs...the meat is sublime, super tender and flavorful, but not overly salty.  The pasticcio (Greek Lasagna) is delicious too. I actually live right up the street from another Yelp fave, the Great Greek, but this place tops them in my opinion."}
{"text":"I chose this place based on yelp and the fact that a Groupon discount was burning a hole in my pocket.  I ended up ordering the beef and lamb gyro dish with wheat pita bread.  The Israeli salad was awesome!  The hummus was not bad and so was the falafel.  They have a nice selection of imported bottled beers and to top it off, I got a free baklava just for checking in on yelp (it was just a small sample piece that was just ok).  I would definitely hit this place up again if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Stephano's!!! Very fresh ingredients that are good quality. 
Super friendly nice staff ever time I've come in, clean restaurant and best of all a clean restroom. 
It's more fast food style but a great on the go spot!
My favorite go to item is pictured, the Greek Salad with the Chicken Kabob and a side of hummus! 
This is plenty and feeds two easily."}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm so happy they opened one on the west side of town. Food is fresh and so delicious. I can't get enough of the garlic sauce! It was a hit with my kids too"}
{"text":"Delicious.  Had the pork wrap.  Checked in on Yelp and received a free baklava.  Soo good"}
{"text":"Been to the Stephano's on Maryland by UNLV & I absolutely loved it! I can definitely say the same about this location.

Their menus are super simple, have many options for anyone & they are flexible to substitutions. The prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get, I even had leftovers, which says a lot for me expecting a baby in a few days, lol! Personally, the plates are best bet since you have so many options, but they have a combo deals as well.

Here's what we ordered:
Me: Chicken shwerma plate w/ French fries substituted for the isreli salad, came with 3 kinds of sauces.
Hubby: Combo plate of chicken kebab & steak kebab w/ French fries substituted for salad, came with one red creamy sauce (IDK the name)
Mom: Beef Dorme? Plate, idk but it was cut pieces of beef
Dad: Beef Kofta plate
Grandma: Chicken shewerma plate
Little brother: Kids meal w/ 2 chicken kebabs & French fries w/ red creamy sauce (I'm assuming now it's their fry sauce lol)

All plates came with choice of white or wheat pita bread which is warmed & wrapped in foil. And the typical sides are the rice, isreli salad & hummus, but as I mentioned before they are flexible w/ substitutions & you can substitute any of your sides w/ a small appetizer... Which I think is SUPER awesome.

You order at the register, take a seat & they serve you, the staff was super friendly & the cashier was awesome at taking the order cuz we had a pretty complicated one in my opinion haha. But everything came out just as we had ordered & in a timely manner. The store is clean & let me say their bathroom is hilariously large for one toilet lol, but still spic & span clean nonetheless.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, the food is awesome, there's something for everyone & it's in a great area of Las Vegas instead of dealing with all the trouble of going across a university & dealing w/ a bunch of college kids grabbing a bite."}
{"text":"Our family always comes in and receives fabulous service from all staff! Food is delicious and never disappoints. Definitely recommend coming :)"}
{"text":"I went to check it out yesterday and was so disappointed. Expensive and not worth it. With 3 restaurants and all the fancy lighting and decorating they forgot how they paid for all of it, GOOD FOOD! Been going there since 2002 and it's been great I have seen them really grow. I always returned for the gyros sandwich. Always fantastic except for yesterday. I got a sandwich fries and drink for almost 11 bucks and they forgot the meat. 2 pieces of meat . I felt robbed. I won't be back. Too many other options. Greek bistros in Henderson sounds good."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome! I ordered the cheesy gyro and my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon kabobs. Amazing flavor to everything we ate. The filet mignon was melt in your mouth great, which is hard to find if you aren't at a steak house. My gyro was delicious, one of the best in Vegas. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Ordered the filet mignon plate and it is ok. A little dry and burnt, but flavorful. Hummus is good too. Wraps look delicious. Overall It's okay."}
{"text":"Wonderful little place that a friend and I had stumbled upon. We had just had a long hot day at Hoover Dam and wanted some grub. Mediterranean fare was what we had agreed upon and because I am one of the few people without a smart phone I had to rely on my car's GPS for a food search. I had the shwarma  salad and it was delish. They also had deals for college students and free baklava with check in. There was also a pickled turnip bar, which I absolutely love. All in all this is a wonderful little place and refreshing as opposed to eating all the franchise junk on the strip. Definitely would return to if I am ever in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ordered the filet kabob plate, Awesome. I couldn't give 5 stars because I ordered my filet medium rare, and there was zero pink inside. Needless to say they gave me well done meat. Not gonna bother sending it back, after it's a fast food type joint.  But I will come back and try it again and hopefully they get it right next time. The hummus is amazing, Definitely a must try place."}
{"text":"My last visit was my LAST visit. To sum up, gyro meat was burnt. Tomatoes were mealy and tasteless. Pita was dry, tasted old. I can say, Stefano's - not a fan"}
{"text":"We ordered the manager special it came fast but look old with no taste , raw and cold , the hummus it's horrible and the worse part we felt so bad after eating some of the food..."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since John Curtas on NPR talked about it years ago (2012 ?). Well, he's a real restaurant critic not me... 
They opened one in Henderson on Eastern and I jetted there for lunch. It was just as great as the one by UNLV. Don't know how Med, Greek, or Jewish food is suppose to be... as I said, I am NOT a food critic. I am a -\"food go here\" guy- and it tasted good and it didn't make me sick! I hear that Med, food is good for ya so bonus! 
Oh yeah, they have beer too."}
{"text":"Always good.
The embodiment of what 'fast casual' should be.

Easy, consistent, fresh foods. 

Favorites:
Filet Kabob Plate w/ wheat pita.
Chicken Kabob Greek Salad

The fries are delicious. Hot and crispy, and you can tell that these people change the fryer oil on an appropriate schedule.

Laid back. 
Cool lighting.
Clean kitchen, drink station, and bathroom."}
{"text":"They have the best baklava in town can't  get enough every time I have to get it they staff over here is great too very attentive"}
{"text":"There's a Greek cafe in Denver Colorado that used to be my favorite,  now I have to come to Las Vegas for the BEST I'm flavor and quality!!"}
{"text":"The Grape Leaves are to die for.   Had Shrimp Kabob rice bowl that was huge & delicious.  Disappointed they advertise beer & wine but they don't serve them yet.
Really recommend this patio dining.  Comfy & fabulous music."}
{"text":"I have nothing but gratitude this restaurant is so close to where we live. We both had a mixed skewer plate, with one chicken breast and one filet minion. Both were marinated to perfection and cooked to perfection. The free baklava was such a treat. We'll surely to be to frequent this resturant."}
{"text":"Stephanos has been one of my favorite Greek restaurants for quite some time. We recently stopped in for our favorite dish, the roasted chicken however it seems as though prices have gone up and portions have gotten smaller. We still like this place for their fresh food and comfortable, casual environment."}
{"text":"so far the best greek/mediterranean food in vegas!"}
{"text":"Fast, easy and so delicious! Great selection of beers, very laid back, great patio to hang out on!"}
{"text":"My family eat here at least once a month. Our go to is the chicken with garlic butter,  Israeli salad,  hummus and rice.  The kids tried the fries today with beef and lamb and loved them.  So far everything we've tried we have enjoyed.  They have wheat or white pita bread to offer.  I always order an a large Israeli salad on the side to pack for lunch the next day with a piece of left over chicken because the portions are so big even if we share we have left overs.  They have gluten free options too."}
{"text":"I got the Gyro Salad and my friend ordered the special-- Gyro with fries. Both of us were satisfied with the food. The man helping us was nice, food arrived promptly and it was delicious. Prices were good, especially for UNLV students nearby. Also, if you are a student you get a free drink!"}
{"text":"I ordered a steak filet to go & was given my order, which I did not check. Drove all the way home to discover I had someone s meals. I took it back & ask for the manager, he was the same person who messed up my order. He said he knew he gave me someone else's meals. No apologies, the owner was just standing there, also no apologies. I just got a refund & left. I will never go there again, it used to be good. CHECK YOUR FOOD & GETSRECEIPT. But I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came in today for the first time and just had a standard gyro, restaurant is very clean and very friendly and very nice establishment, I will return"}
{"text":"These Yelpers are not lying with their reviews! Stephano's is insanely good! My boss took us for lunch here to celebrate Administrative Professional Day (It's a thing, crazy, I know) and holy cow, one of the best lunches together, for sure. 

I ordered the Beef Shawerma Plate ($13) and because it was before 3 pm, we were all given free drinks. The plate came with pita bread, salad, hummus, sauce (choice of tahini or tzatziki), rice and of course, the delicious beef shawarma. The pita was warm and soft and was the perfect pillow for a dollop of their hummus, your choice of sauce, rice and flavorful meat.

We also all shared Loaded Chicken Shawerma Fries ($10), which is a meal by itself. The fries are super crispy and seasoned well. It was so good dipped in hummus and also their special fry sauce. The chicken was also so flavorful.

Basically, if you think you won't like Greek food or you've had better somewhere else, try Stephano's and it may change your mind! Also, don't forget to check in for your free slice of their baklava."}
{"text":"If you like Greek or Mediterranean food and want a place that I just easy....This is it!!

We have used their takeout menu on many occasions. It's been great when we have a party or need to entertain and want more than just pizza or some other Italian or American food. 

It's definitely got the quality level under control. Everything is good!!  Especially their desert items. 

What I like best is that it is really quick!"}
{"text":"It use to be great when the actual owners were here. I have given them many chances to fix problems this will be my last time. They rarely get the order correct. Today I called it in. Came into a line . No one to get pick up orders out. The order was wrong yet another time. I'm done. I get indigestion and had from it anyway. This is an example of owners leaving it to children and robots to run their biz."}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent food, excellent service. And we especially love there to-go food platters when we have guests in town."}
{"text":"Great place, I love Gyros and decided to get the plate along with the free baklava from Yelp. I can honestly say that the portion size let alone the amount of meat exceeded expectations. Food was very tasty, loved the humus. The lamb/beef gyro meat was tasty and greasy as it typically is. May not be the best protein but oh so yummy. Very good value for your money."}
{"text":"First time here, amazing !! Best hummus I've had in town. Had the gyro fries, falafel plate and mousakka. Everything was amazing. We live on the other side of town but will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"I order from this location at least every week. The guys there have great customer service and the food is great. The location is still new but they do a great job keeping it clean. Love the food here and humus. I've never like humus until I came here. I've recommend all my coworkers to come here. Oh and the baklava is good too."}
{"text":"This review is for pickup, as we did not dine in. 

Five stars for this delicious food. I love a good Greek restaurant, and Stephano's definitely hit the mark. Their feta is so flavorful. Try the feta and olives appetizer, it's delicious! Oh and their feta fries are topped with melted cheese, herbs, and crumbled feta, with a typical delicious fry sauce that has a bit of a tangy kick. The spinach pie is absolutely delicious with the most crumbly and tasty pastry. And of course, no Greek spot is complete without the delicious buttery rice pilaf, and theirs was no exception! This food was so good that after dinner last night, we decided to order lunch from their Henderson location."}
{"text":"Greek salad with a skewer of chicken is so good!!!! Excellent food! Clean place and great staff."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! The young man working behind was very nice! He offered another couple and us a sample of the baklava. Look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of the Mediterranean restaurant that was located at this address before Stephano's. But I was pleasantly surprised when a new one opened up and tried it the other night.

The concept is quick service, although we dined in. However, the prices are more than other quick service restaurants. We spent close to $40 for two of us. The food is super tasty though and I will definitiely dine here again. I know they are new and may be ironing out the kinks, but I would make the recommendation that the service should be faster. We didnt mind as much because we were dining in, but it was on the slow end for a quick service restaurant that was not busy when we arrived.

Also, the texture of the chicken shawarma leaves something to be desired. The taste was excellent, but the texture was a little on the rubber-side. Perhaps use better chicken or a different preparation method? Regardless, I will be back. This place is good and in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Prices are high for lunch, but quality and quantity are good! Lunch orders come with a free drink,  and if you check in on yelp, you get a free small baklava. I like how their radish is self serve. When visiting Henderson next time, I will def stop by here to get my Mediterranean fix."}
{"text":"I keep coming back. Food is packed with flavor. They are very accommodating if you need to modify things a bit. They offer a 'low carb' option, though you won't want it -- even the rice is delicious."}
{"text":"Gyro bowl with choice of white or wheat pita bread and free drink for students at $10. Decent amount of food. Pita bread comes out wrapped in foil to keep warm. Rest of food comes in an aluminum pan (if in cases you want to take leftovers, can get lid from them). Decent amount of rice and meat. Rice is so yummy imo. Wish they gave more than one container of the tzatziki sauce though :3 (maybe can ask but i never did ... ) so yummy with the rice and/or meat. 

Clean. Doesn't smell like hookah (avail at nights i believe?) = well ventilated. 

Free WiFi avail 

Not Busy every time ive been here. Aside from my own party, maybe on average 1-3 other parties there at the same time. Lots of tables. Spacious.

Close by to UNLV for students. Never came here aside from lunch time so not sure how it is at any other time."}
{"text":"Came here usually to pick up food ordered online since its so close to the hospital. 

The most recent visit, we had an order of 5 items consisting of 3 Beef & Lamb Gyro plates and 2 Beef & Lamb Gyro salads. Stood in line for a few minutes with a few people in front of me but was fairly quick. 

When I had told the cashier the name for my order, the cashier had gave me a small bag. Knowing my order I had opened the bag to check, and it was filled with wrapped pita bread, dressing and tzatziki sauce, and utensils. I asked the cashier where the rest of my order was and she saw the other bag with 5 plates. She told me they usually label on receipt on bag stating there are multiple bags but I guess it didn't this time. I decided to open that bag (omg why do they double tie it... HARD TO UNTIE !) to check the order. 3 normal gyro plates, 1 normal gyro salad, 1 gyro salad without feta cheese and dressing. Had to check the \"special\" one as the one who ordered it is very particular and I didn't want him to be mad LOL... Luckily enough, the order was made right and I left

As a student in the past at UNLV, I had dined at Stephanos many times for their gyro bowl which I had recently got at the SW location too. My friend had suggested the gyro plate and to make the order easier, I had opt'ed for that as well. 

When I got my plate.. WAO THERES A LOT OF FOOD ! lots of gyro meat, a large amount of hummus, a good amount of Israeli salad consisting tomatoes, and 4 pieces of pita bread. 

For only a $3 difference between a plate and bowl... DEFINITELY worth getting a plate. You get much less meat and don't even get hummus when you get a bowl. It was so good ! love gyro meat ! Wiped the hummus up clean with pita bread. Suffered from FOOD COMA right after.... LOL still wasn't enough to hold that alcohol I drank later ... .dot dot dot xD"}
{"text":"Super nice staff and management.

Restaurant very clean.

Food yummy.

Recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was just ok; it was overpriced and tasted decent, as far as Mediterranean food goes I was not impressed.

The beef shawarma was bland and not well seasoned, the complimentary salad had way too much vinegar and the hummus was plain and not good.

The spinach pie was very dry and crumbled apart fast, the issue with this was that the pie pieces were very large and needed to be held in your hands.

Tldr: expensive and mediocre"}
{"text":"I am a Stephanos fan for life. I've tried a variety of items and everything has been delicious (although the falafel is my absolute favorite)! Food, service and atmosphere all rock! I can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"Delish! We love the food here and are so happy that they opened their Henderson location so we didn't have to hike all the way up to UNLV to get some of their good eats. Everything is cooked fresh - their chicken is great, their steak kabobs are incredible (altho I usually ask them to cook mine a little longer as I tend to like my beef well done) , and their fries are incomparable. You can go with their standard plates or customize them to your liking if you prefer something different, and they are happy to accommodate you."}
{"text":"Best mediterranean in the area.  Chicken kebob is the winner for me.  Consistent and not too greasy.  Chips are also awesome!  Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"I couldn't eat the food from the taco place a few doors away (food allergy)so I went outside and started walking the strip mall looking for food!  Well, it was one of the BEST walks I've taken in awhile looking for food.  I walked into Stephano's checked out their menu, prices, and cleanliness.. I was hooked before I ordered/ate! Fresh quality food without a bunch of additives.  The food at Stephano's is amazing.  Freshly prepared,  reasonably priced, a lot of food for your money, and most of all A-1 customer service!  Very clean restaurant. The manager (Ron) is awesome!  He was very nice and accommodating to customers.. Even when he was dealing with an extremely rude customer., he kept his cool and went above and beyond to please.  OK, back to the food - I ordered the steak salad.  It came with hummus, pita, and chopped tomato salad tossed in a tasty dressing.  The steak was  flavorful and tender.. The lettuce wasn't wilted, but crisp and fresh. The hummus was delicious as well.  AND THE PITAS ARE HOMEMADE.. I had the wheat pitas.  Very, very good!  My son and husband walked from the taco place and found me inside Stephano's.  My son couldn't resist ordering the pita w/Nutella.  He was a happy guy.  His smile told me how good it was, therefore I took a little bite.. I will order it myself next visit!  It's sinfully delicious!  Two homemade pitas w/nutella spread inside!  Hot off the grill dusted with powder sugar. Big portion and only $3.99.  BTW, I was in Vegas celebrating my birthday.  I mentioned it to Ron.. He gave me a FREE piece of baklava.  Totally unexpected.  I ate it later in the day.. BEST BAKLAVA I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I have visted Stephanos 4 times in the prior 6 weeks. I have ordered the Gyro Wrap ( Beef/Lamb ) and the Steak Kebab wrap ( tzatziki - no hummus ).

The Gyros were good ( meat generally overcooked ), and the Steak Kebabs were Excellent ! The place is clean,provides good customer service and the prices are reasonable. Their tzatziki sauce is correctly prepared. They will include extra sauce ( no charge ). Kudos to them. I would recommend Stephanos. Can't speak for their other dishes. I will try some of them ( when TBD ) ...... but i'm a Gyro freak and proud of it."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location, and I can't get over how nice Stephanos was decorated inside. The inside reminded me of what an NYC rooftop bar looked like, but instead we were inside of a Vegas Greek restaurant.  The food never disappoints and the service matches. I tend to stick with my go to meal, the chicken Kebob plate with double rice and no Israeli salad. I always take my order to go and I don't get that \"I'm sure it would have been better at the restaurant\" taste that other places give off. The best part of Stephanos is the garlic lard sauce. Garlic, lard, olive oil = heaven!! This stuff is so amazingly delicious I slather it all over the rice, the pita, the chicken, the hummus, and even mix inside the fry sauce. I LOVE IT!! Thank you Stephanos for such delicious food!"}
{"text":"Look guys, the hummus today was definitely made with pinto beans and you know it. I eat here a lot, that just ain't right."}
{"text":"Got a gyro meal. It's really good. The beef and lamb were really tasty. I would want to try some of their chicken when I go next. Unlv ID card gets you a free drink."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of Greek and this place is absolutely delicious. The Gyro plate rules!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a doner kebab years ago in Paris and could never find anything remotely similar n delicious... until we had a lamb gyro from Stephano's. It is heaven in your mouth! Lol I'm not even a big Greek or Mediterranean fan, but Stephano's is crazy delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in the valley. I love their baba ganoush, shrimp kebabs and baklava. So yummy. A forever customer."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Greek place in all of Las Vegas.  I love any chicken item they serve with extra garlic lard sauce. Its amazing.  I also order for delivery and its pretty quick for vegas standards."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Mediterranean cuisine that is fast, affordable, and delicious. Go to Stephano's. I didn't discover this place until a few years ago and I regret not knowing about it earlier. It's no Paymon's, but the price and quick service makes it worth while."}
{"text":"I found my go-to greek grill here in Henderson. It was always busy when I passed by and knew that was a good sign. Great gyros and kabobs. Soft pita bread, good rice and fresh taste. Plenty of food left us full and satisfied after my first visit."}
{"text":"Order a chicken plate through post mates. Very generous portions especially considering the affordable price. The rice and hummus were amazing. Pita bread was also good but that's hard to mess up. The chicken was decent, a little bit dry though. I would like to try it again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with gluten free options marked on their menu. The filet mignon steak kebab salad and the chicken kebab salad is delicious. My family has made this our every Friday dinner. Take out is quick and they even have delivery option."}
{"text":"I try not to write negative reviews but this was the worst Mediterranean food I've had. I know that's a strong statement but holy cow I was not impressed. $14 chicken kabob lunch special and 20 minute wait with only two people in the restaurant was the first strike. The food was not terrible but definitely not good. Chicken was bland and I had to soak it in lemon juice to get any taste out of out. Only reason this place didn't get 1 star is because the hummus was pretty good and the staff was nice. Other than that, spend a few bucks more and go to a sit down restaurant with a waiter. Can't stress enough how bland the food was."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was great. We had two gyros and fries, both were excellent in flavor. The gyro meat was nicely spiced and it had a little crunch on the outside of the meat which is perfect. I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Went there with a group and we all LOVED it. Grew up in a neighborhood surrounded by similar establishments. This was as good as any of them. Friendly staff. EXCELLENT."}
{"text":"Nothing was bad.  Service was walk up to the counter, place your order, retrieve your order--in other words, there was no service to speak of.  At least the woman at the counter took the order, rang it up and passed it on to the cook, and did so efficiently and pleasantly.  The decor is nothing special.

I had the falafel pita with fries--the falafel needed to be a bit more spicy, the dressing needed to be more tart and mint-laced, and the fries were those nasty ones with faux crispy coating.  I don't like any fries that aren't identifiably real potato and nothing more.

Unless I find some place substantially better to satisfy my occasional falafel cravings, I'll return."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food served in nice, large portions. 

Stephano's is located right across from the university, making it a great lunch spot - especially if you're looking for something more local and authentic than the usual chain fast food. I usually get the Chicken Kebabs and have never had any complaints."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal.  Ordered beef & lamb gyro plate with a side of falafel.  Falafel were crispy and tasty.  Gyro plate came with hummus.  Large portion will fill you up.  Everything was fresh and perfectly balanced."}
{"text":"Our most recent visit was our 3rd.  They offer up outstanding friendly service.  The menu hits all the right notes and the food is fresh and flavorful.  The setting is casual and comfortable and the prices are reasonable.  You can see the kitchen, which speaks to the cleanliness and pride they take in serving up great Mediterranean food.  I am sure you'll love it too."}
{"text":"What can I say. By far the best Greek food in Vegas. I live in West Vegas and come to Henderson when I need great Greek food!!"}
{"text":"The guy who took my order was really friendly and I told him it was my first time eating here. He recommended the Chicken Gyro Shawarma, among other things. I decided to get that as a combo which came with fries and a drink for a total of about $10.

Kind of pricey in my opinion. I probably should have just stuck with the sandwich alone. After I ordered, I checked in and received my free baklava, a Mediterranean pastry. The food came out quickly after.

The gyro was great and I loved the sauce that came with it. Their fries also tasted fresh and were seasoned very well. The only thing is, I wish the portions were a bit bigger for a $10 combo. It was filling enough, but I'm not sure if it was completely worth it. I will say I loved the taste of the chicken. It has a good smokey flavor and you can see that they make it fresh when you're ordering.

Overall, this place has my thumbs up. They make me want to  try other Greek joints and see if they can compare to Stephano's. I give this place a solid 4 stars, and I would bump it to a 5, but as I said earlier, it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Solid Greek food - I normally go for the gyro, but I've also had the chicken kabobs. Staff is friendly and attentive. I just recently noticed their beer selection. A surprising number of Greek beers - mostly lagers and pilsners, with a porter thrown in for kicks. I'd pair that with a baklava for dessert!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! My amazing wife has done it once again....she managed to find a hidden gem.....well i am a pretty big fan of Mediterranean food so she already had me there but this place was hands down my favorite place here in Vegas so far....service was good and the place was clean and the beef and lamb plate my wife and i had were more than satisfying .....i was stuffed but my crazy wife remembered they sold baklava .....omg it was warm and fresh and i about died due to the amazing flavors of the baklava....id highly recommend this if you dont want something to upscale and just want a meal that will meet all of your expectations!"}
{"text":"This is fast food. I ordered the donor plate. The meat was over cooked & greasy. The vegetables had no taste, the humus same. Fast food service. I brought home leftovers & tossed them in the garbage disposal. Never again"}
{"text":"This place is my best friend's favorite restaurant. The food here (although pricey) is really good. It's expensive buy it still has kept me coming back. A new girl though is kind of ruining my experience as she so far has overcharged or given me the wrong order 3 times in a row. She also gives me a bad look each time I come over. If it wasn't for her, I would have given the place 5 stars. And I did finally stop eating there because of her poor service."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food I have ever eaten! Cheese gyro is amazing so is the falafel. There is no item here I don't love!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.   Large portions.   I got the #5 gyro player which was served with rice, hummus and a tomato vinegar salad.  The cost was $13.00.  I also ordered the baklava for $1.00.   Everything was light and fresh.  The gyro meat was grilled to perfection.  The restaurant was very clean and tasteful.   The only downside is it proximity to the collage which can make getting out of the parking lot difficult at times.  I also wish the gyro had come with feta but truthfully it wasn't needed."}
{"text":"Stephanos is a great place to go to get your fix of good healthful Mediterranean food without paying the high price of a nice sit down Mediterranean restaurant. I ordered 4 of their chicken kebab bowls (for me and my family) and it was delicious! It comes with rice, Israeli salad, chicken, and pita. And make sure to get the garlic sauce for the chicken because it is sooo good. The reason I gave 4 stars out of 5 is because a couple pieces of the chicken seemed to be pretty chewy. And they forgot my baklava that I was supposed to get for checking in on Yelp :("}
{"text":"Before I mention the amazing quality of food, the environment here at Stephano's is so welcoming and friendly. The service here is just exquisite. The restaurant is definitely family friendly and I love dining here all the time. I now find myself here weekly and also ordering take-out. 
The food is cooked to perfection. Just the way I like it. I HIGHLY recommend you try this place out. I guarente you will fall in love and become hooked! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food not far from me. I ordered falafel wrap and the feta fries and had a little of my husband's salad. Amazingly good and everything tasted really fresh. Staff was very friendly. Would definitely come back and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Totally impressed, so good! Seemed a little expensive for lunch at first, but the portion sizes and obvious incredible quality of food made the price insignificant. 
Ordered chicken kabobs and kofta. Chicken was unremarkable but good. Hummus and wheat pita bread were very good. Kofta was great! Hint of mint seasoning, grilled perfectly. 
Then our free baklava OH EMM GEE.. Sweet with touch of cinnamon.. Pure heaven!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend and was quite surprised with the interior décor versus the outside appearance. I ordered the gyro plate and they accommodated my diet and switched out the rice for salad. Large portions however, I (would have given them a 5 star) but I would have liked more meat. If you like Mediterranean food its a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Usually, I would give this place 5 stars! But this is the 3rd time I've gotten to go and they have forgotten something! Just got a delivery and yet again they forgot my pita bread. I tried to call, and they're closed now... after the delivery driver just left my house. Very frustrating."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food and service is great, there's always something new to try. I can't stop eating their baklava!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for takeout Thursday night for a bite after class.  We ordered the veggie kebab (mushroom, tomato, onion, zucchini, squash) which came with Israeli salad, hummus and rice pilaf, and we ordered a side of lentil rice.

The veggies were perfectly grilled.  I found the veggies to be slightly overwhelmed by the vinegar marinade.  The rice pilaf was actually my favorite!  The rice was perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  The Israeli salad and hummus were what I expected, but the lentil rice was a disappointment.  The flavor was nice, but it was so soggy it was a dense ball.  Bummer, the picture on their website looked so fluffy."}
{"text":"This place sucks. First of all every time I go and order half chicken they never seem to have it ready. 1hr wait. Service is not the greatest either."}
{"text":"Coworker's friend recommended this place! Been here quite a few times! Their grilled chicken is delicious! I like how they have wheat pita! Their rice is really, really good! 
Not a lot of Greek places impress me but this one has to be a second favorite!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Came here for lunch after class. Everything me and my friends got was delicious. The baklava is delicious. I would come here just for a piece. Come by, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to both locations and received great food at both. The chicken kabobs had great flavor and texture. If you want some extra protein, opt for the low carb and get double the kabobs. The Gyro was very tasty, but could have used a little more meat. The israeli salad is excellent."}
{"text":"This is some of the very best greek food, or any type of food for that matter in town. I pretty much come here once a week, and every single thing is good. Top five favorite restaurants in town, highest recommendation."}
{"text":"This place never fails! The food is always fresh and delicious! I usually get the chicken gyro  with a side of baba ghanoush. The tzatziki is just right and they have awesome fries with yummy dipping sauce. These guys have been around for a long time and for good reason. Their customer service is always great from phone to pickup! Thanks for treating your customers right!"}
{"text":"I love getting takeout from here when I'm in the mood for Greek. The kabobs are my favorite!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The staff were super friendly and the food was amazing. You can tell that the quality of the food is very good. I ended up getting the beef shawarma pita and it was absolutely delicious. The portions were good and it definitely hit the spot. It's a very casual, and open space that also offers outdoor seating. I believe they're also dog friendly in the patio area cause I noticed they offered a dog water bowl. This place is definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Lamb and Beef Gyro: your choice of white or wheat pita blanketing some super tender and flavorful meat, large dice onions and tomatoes. They were very generous on the amount of protein in their gyros; I remember seeing it all wrapped up, and being a little bummed because it looked a touch small (what? I was starved..) but when I picked it up it felt like a brick in my hand. Much more filling than it appeared. 

Fries with Herbed Feta: the fries I had were heavenly; golden and crispy on the outside- just to give it a little bite. The feta was plentiful- I hate it when I order Greek fries and my cheese is microscopic. I thought it was strange that it was served with the \"special\" fry sauce- I've never been to a Mediterranean restaurant that served fry sauce. I typically love the stuff, but the fries were great solo. 

Service: really awesome. I was at the counter, unsure of weather I wanted to try the pilaf or the fries.. I love me some rice pilaf.. The cashier was super nice and talked me through both; I really like when the employees seem to take pride in the food they serve. 

PROS:
Lots of meat.
As much extra sauce as you'd like. Free.
Good food.
Even better service.

CONS:
If there were any, this wouldn't be a 5-star place, now would it?"}
{"text":"hobby got the gyro bowl $7.87, I got the chicken Shawerma wrap with fries and a drink $8.25. Fries taste great, try the fries sauce. it's interesting. my chicken shawerma has some garlic sauce and tahini sauce.  it was the best compare to Filfila Mediterranean Cafe or  Kyklos Gyro.  Even it's not as big as the Kyklos Gyro, you can order the gyro bowl (either chicken or the beef lamb gyro), rice are delicious (maybe cook with gravy from the gyro). Honey cannot finish all the rice from his combo.  Definitely will come again."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I have now moved away from Vegas and keep trying other \"Greek\" restaurants hoping to find something as good and authentic as Stephano's. So far I have been unsuccessful. My weekly go to was the Chicken Kebab Salad. Fresh and delicious. Order online and it will be waiting for you."}
{"text":"I ordered a beef shewarma plate for $14 something dollars. The beef what not marinated at all. It was not shewarma. The salad did not taste fresh and the restaurant is very ugly inside. I would not go back. I would have had a better lunch with $14.00 around here. Remember this is students area right across from UNLV."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch during their soft opening this weekend. I knew right away I was in for a treat when I saw a couple of their upright gyro rotisserie grills grilling up the meats. Also what caught my attention was that they offer low carb items in their menu and also your choice of wheat pita bread. Love healthier choices! 

Ordered the Beef & Lamb Gyro sandwich which I upgraded to a combo that included an appetizer and drink. Great deal for under ten dollars.  Meat was seasoned nicely and real tender, pita bread soft, and the tzatziki sauce in it was outstanding. . Love the generous portion of Hummus that I chose for my appetizer as well. Also got to try a sample of salad and baklava. All I have to say is I'm happy that we have another authentic Greek restaurant in the area. Everything is fresh and definitely made from scratch.

Casual dining area.. there is enough seating to handle a busy lunch crowd ..order at counter and they bring your food out to you. Service is helpful and friendly.  Big plus they are open early for breakfast and also will have a breakfast menu.  Their menu has some of my Greek favorites Pasticcio and Moussaka! Even a Vegetarian version of it! So I'm looking forward to trying out more dishes from here so I can update this review. I bet then I can bump it up to five stars! Find this place in the Smith's strip mall near the coffee shop."}
{"text":"This was a recommendation by a co-worker and a few of us decided to give it a go. It's a hidden gem across from UNLV. I got the gyros plate and it was really good. The meat was tender and flavorful. I love the hummus with pita and it comes with a side salad and rice. Their fries with the sauce is amazing! I'd come here again to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"First time visitor my wife...she ordered a Chicken Kabob Salad with extra chicken kabob and I ordered a Loaded Beef Shawerma fries. Receipt order time was 4:35pm. I walked up to staff at 5:02pm wondering how long does it take to get food here. while all the staff was just chit-chating. I asked the girl how long does it take to get food here.  Staff member said..what did I order. I told her...she said it normally takes 10 minutes or so because I ordered a kabob..I said then why is my food not done...if it's almost been 30 minutes.....she apologized and still did not bring the kabob out with or order...she said they forgot I would have given a 1 star but the food was not that bad....."}
{"text":"Pretty good effort for meditteranean  food.  Had the gyros plate which included hummus and small cucumber, onion and tomato salad and tzatziki (gyros) sauce. It was good but a bit dry.  Nothing spectacular.  International choices for bottled beer.  Small sidewalk area for tables in a real busy plaza. A bit overpriced for fast food"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. So good! Came in the afternoon on a Tuesday and no one was there except for us so I was nervous at first, but the food came fast and it was the best gyro I've had! We got the combo with a gyro, fries and a drink. The fries were amazing as well, definitely not your regular out-of-the-bag frozen fries. I asked for extra taziki sauce and they didn't charge me. Overall great experience and I'll be returning soon!"}
{"text":"What can I say, I'm crazy for Greek food to begin with, and I've been to this location a handful of times now and they have yet to disappoint! I usually get the lamb gyro with fries (their fry sauce is to die for), sometimes I'll get the Greek salad if I'm feeling the leafy greens. Both are amazing options! Everything tastes fresh and authentic, and is consistent every time. I've also ordered take out and postmates from this location and each time the food has been warm and fresh tasting when it made it to my door. Overall my favorite Greek food place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My husbands suggestion was a good one! 

We stopped in for lunch.  They were pretty busy with inside diners and carry out orders.  I took this as a good sign.  The service was good.  He was very helpful in our lunch choices all with a friendly personality.   

I decided on the beef and lamb gyro with the feta fries on the side.  The gyro was great.  It is definitely packed full.  The meat had a great flavor! The mound of feta fries were too much to handle.  They were good but a little different with the sprinkled oregano all over the top.   I would have liked them better without the oregano but not too bad.  

With the Yelp check in, you received a free baklava.  It was absolutely perfect. It is a small piece but after the portion size of their lunch you don't need anymore than that.  

I am pleased to find another Greek restaurant with great food.  Thank you Stephano's!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite in town! Gyros are amazing and so are the fries. The lady at the cashier desk is always so kind. PS they aren't stingy with their sauces either - and their fry sauce is AMAZING! Highly recommended from this foodie! :)"}
{"text":"**first time trying chicken shawarma so I don't really have anything to compare it to

With that being said, we ordered ahead for pick up. Went with the chicken shawarma bowl, substituted the salad for some fries :) 
If you like your fries to stay crispy, recommend ordering them on the side cause the moisture that locks into the bowl will make the fries soggy. 

Everything was so fulfilling. Came with an assortment of sauces, the chicken was not dry and the food didn't look like much, but I had to split it into two separate meals (my favorite kind of problem) 

Come in during their lunch special which is every day until 3, gets you a free drink with the purchase of a drink bowl or salad. Didn't really look around the actual store setup since I was picking up my order, but definitely will be back when I'm feeling a super filling chicken bowl"}
{"text":"4 vegetarians just stuffed our faces with 4 different tasty options! Fresh veggies, awesome dips, excellent falafel. Highly recommended, glad we missed our turn for the intended restaurant and stumbled into this place. The dip labeled \"t\" was a very unique flavor that I can't say was my favorite. Two of us spent 21$ for lunch so medium price-wise."}
{"text":"Took our family here for dinner last night. Have seen it go in & been wanting to try it for a long time. We had a coupon & decided to try it. Absolutely incredible food! My husband & I had the gyro platter. Lots of food, had to take some home. Took home some baklava for dessert. It was the best baklava I've had in a long time! Fresh, not dried out, with honey dripping out of it. To die for! Reminded me of what my Ya ya used to make. Definitely will be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend went to this place because of a flyer I receiced several months ago..i ordered the beef shawarma and he ordered something else..the food was delicious..but when we went back a week later we both ordered the beef shawarma plate..it looked and tasted like left overs old meat with some parts cold/warm from the week before reheated in the microwave disgusting disgusting food..i went up to the counter to complain but the Girl was too busy taking orders and didn't care..they also throw this 20% Tip in your face at checkout..for the same price we could have ate at the Red Rock buffet 37.00...The owner should be ashamed for allowing such garbage to be fed to it's customers..i will be reporting this place to the health department soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet, as I try to eat in it at least once a week since coming to Las Vegas. If you're in the neighborhood, or even if you are far away, this is the Greek restaurant you should be coming too. The Mediterranean food is totally fantastic!

They have a variety of different salads ranging from Greek salad with chicken kebab, gyro meat, filet of beef, etc. he salad comes with a side of pita bread, either whole wheat or regular (app for the whole wheat, it is sweet as sugar!)

I typically get the grilled chicken kebab Greek salad and it is fantastic. It's the size of a bushel basket and could easily last two meals, but who has time for that! Everything else on the menu looks fantastic so if you're in the neighborhood give this a shot.

So here's the rundown:

Satisfied? Yes

Return? Yes

Advocate? Yes"}
{"text":"This place is a really great stop for a casual lunch or a quick and easy dinner (especially for a to-go order). The location is convenient and counter service is friendly. The shawerma is delicious and the garlic sauce side is amazing. Love the rice it comes with as well. You also can't go wrong with the grape leaf wraps (dolmas) and baklava of course. If you're looking for a good, filling Mediterranean style meal at a decent price with the convenience of a fast food joint, then I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place several times now and every time I throw in an item I've never ordered before to give things a try. I have NEVER been disappointed. Everything is delicious, fresh, large portion, etc. I absolutely love this place and it's a favorite for my sons and me."}
{"text":"I found a new place to eat when I'm in town! I wanted to take a couple of my friends to eat Mediterranean food because they've never had it and so I yelped a place near them and found this one! OMG, I have been craving it since I left! and so has my friends! They're definitely fans of the food.

Yay:
-Rice pilaf: so simple but so good! Had a subtle flavor to it... maybe chicken broth and butter but it was definitely the best rice pilaf I've had.
-tri tip shwarma: this is my favorite dish here! I ate it with some yogurt sauce and it was the best thing I did all day!  Tri tip was flavorful and tender. MUST TRY!
-Beef kefta kebab: this too had a good flavor

My friend's picky 2 year old actually ate the food! She was a big fan as well."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. Came here for a fast lunch. This is a fast food Greek food eatery. Go up to the counter to order. Then they bring you the food. Lots of options for combo plates. I was interested in a chicken skewer. However, the combo plates all featured a large portion of rice in addition to salad and 2 skewers, about $12. Not a good low carb option. However, I went with two chicken skewers and a veggie skewer a la carte . Same 12 bucks and not a carb in sight. The chicken was moist and tender. The veggies were grilled perfectly. A lot of food for a lunch. But good eating. If I'm in the area, I will definitely return for a very informal fast lunch."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Stephano\"s. All the employees are very friendly. They recently changed the seating inside and made it a comfortable setup for eating in. I however choose to take my order to go. Ordered beef and lamb gyro and a protein beef and lamb.
Customer service at the counter was great, he was very friendly guy. Sorry didn't catch your name. Recieved the order in around 10 min, they even included exta sauce without me even  asking. Thumbs up for that. The dinning room and kitchen are very clean, you can see the whole kitchen area.
Food was great, meat was tasty and flavorful. Portion size was big I was stuffed, but it was so good. Frys were great if you like crispy frys, which I do. All around great food and service definitely A+ establishment"}
{"text":"First time!

My brother, a UNLV student and longtime fan of Stephano's, brought my father and me here for an early dinner. 

He likes it because it's so close to school, the portions are big, the prices are low, and they give free drinks as part of a student discount. I like it because the food was GREAT - flavorful, fresh, and tasty! My dad likes it because they don't put lettuce (or as he calls it: \"rabbit food\") in his Israeli salad. For different reasons, we were all happy customers. 

I opted for the Greek Salad, with lamb/beef gyro meat on top. It was a hearty plate of crisp greens, sliced tomatoes, cucumber, olives, and feta. The portion was terrific - I wasn't able to finish it, even though I desperately wanted to. The house dressing was AWESOME. Highly recommend. It was both sweet and savory, with a tangy zing to it. They gave a generous helping of it on the side, which I proceeded to drown every forkful into. I also requested a side of tzatziki sauce to dunk my gyro meat. As a big fan of Mediterranean food, I appreciated that the salad greens were so fresh, and that the flavors were so robust! 

Dad had a pita with falafel. He offered me a bite, which was generous of him. It turned out to be delicious - if the roles were reversed, I probably wouldn't have shared it!

My brother had the shrimp skewer plate. He happily proclaimed that the shrimp at Stephano's were his favorite shrimp, probably in the whole world, like ever. :) He kindly let me have one -- the flavor was smokey and rich. I wasn't quite as bananas about the shrimp as he was, but they were good. I'm a fan of citrus on my seafood, and think that these skewers could have benefitted from a healthy squeeze of lemon. 

Be sure to check in for the free baklava! It was sweet, crispy, and nutty -- a small little square of honey heaven.

The only thing I noticed was that they kept the place a bit warm. We went on a summer day around 4:00 - when the sun burns at full force. I was uncomfortably hot during the meal.  

But the food was solid and the flavors were on point, so I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! I love their Greek salad and hummus. This place is a family favorite."}
{"text":"We are super picky eaters, especially when it comes to hummus but these guys know what they are doing. Best hummus I've had outside of Israel. Authentic cuisine!  Plus, they deliver.  Can't wait to order from here again."}
{"text":"Stephano's has a nice, clean environment. They have menus right when you walk in so I generally have an idea of what I want before I get to the cashier. 

I generally get the combo with chicken and steak. Can't go wrong with that! I've gotten the chicken leg option before but I didn't find the chicken as juicy as I'd like. I love that they offer a wheat pita bread option. I normally don't see that in Greek places. I always do the baklava check in whenever I come in. It's a nice sweet treat for after a good Greek meal!

They have condiments you can get for yourself i.e. pickled turnips, jalapenos, and lemons. (I grabbed some jalapenos just because I love them, despite it not complementing my plate). I loved the Israeli salad. It tasted super fresh and was just a refreshing side. The grilled chicken definitely tasted like it just came off a grill (good!) and the steak was noticeably tender. However, the hummus, rice, and pita paled in comparison to the meats. They were mediocre at best.

P.S. They have an outside patio with a pet waterer (dog friendly I presume!)"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I love this place. Food is great, service is great too! I could eat this food for the rest of my life and never get sick of it"}
{"text":"I am very reluctant to try new foods. So happy I tried this place! My fiance & I eat here a few times a month. We have had several different items.. too much to name them all however all of them have been great! We even have ordered pick up to go and order is right every time!"}
{"text":"Holy cow is this place amazing.

Coming from LA a rotisserie place has garlic sauce, so to walk in and see that.. I knew I was in for a treat! 

I got chicken kabob and tri-tip shawarma. The kabob was good but I definitely want to go back for the full chicken. But the tri-tip was out of this world! I have been craving it since I found out about it!!!

Man I cannot wait!!"}
{"text":"MMMMM I love Mediterranean food. My chicken shawarma hit the spot. They have plenty of delicious salads and I couldn't stop eating their fries. They offer a free baklava if you check in I think. We forgot to -,-' get ours."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here today for our office. The hummus and pita are amazing. However, the falafel are not very good in my opinion. They are extremely gritty with minimal flavor and places on lettuce that wilts from the heat. I only gave it 3 stars because the hummus is that good!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Go here at least once a week. Food is delicious and reasonably priced. Service is very good and I love the vibe in the restaurant."}
{"text":"We generally go to Paymans but saw this place close to us. Boy was that a find! I had the lamb Gyro and she had the Chicken Kabob. Both meals were absolutely fantastic. Will be back again and again. The Humus was really good too!"}
{"text":"I love the variety and everything i have had has been great. Chicken shawarma wrap, the salad and the plate are all pretty healthy choices and taste great. The filet wrap was yummy as well as the beef shawarma. The shrimp and veggie salad/bowl and plate are good too. The creme brûlée is by far the best. You can even order from the kids menu and its still enough food for one. Oh, and the falafel wrap is delish as well as the futush salad. So basically, you can't go wrong with your selection. Awesome service and staff! We are very fortunate they opened this location close to home. Love love Stephano's :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. The filet mignon kebab is amazing! They have this garlic butter that goes with the pitas and I am addicted. They make everything fresh it is a great lunch and dinner place."}
{"text":"This place is a bit expensive but worth it..  It is in a small shopping center so you need to hunt for it.  Th e food is really good.  The servings aren't huge but I have always savored my meals here.  

Be careful about your timeline at lunchtime - it becomes super crowded.

Check it out if you are in the area. The staff is very hospitable."}
{"text":"A friend of mine was eating her hummus Ha moose (Armenian pronunciation) from starbucks the other day and I commented at how I liked hummus and gyros and she started telling me about Stephanos... And how I just HAD TO GO! So the bf and I took the dog and walked to this wonderful greek/mediterranean place. The gyro is awesome! Just the right amount of meat with cucumbers and tomatos and onions.... Now this is why I am writing the review: the BAKLAVA!! I have had a lot of baklava and this one is the BEST! Just the right amount of nuts to phylo dough and it is crispy and not gummy... YUM YUM YUM"}
{"text":"Meh. Their lamb meat is ground up with beef.  There is no option for just lamb meat by itself.  So while I was expecting a nice, lean piece of Lamb, what I received is burnt, fatty, greasy pieces of mystery meat.  Maybe the chicken would have been a better choice. Also,  the option for their \"healthy \" Greek vinagerette salad dressing represented a container of nothing but flavorless oil.  The free piece of baklava upon check in wasn't too bad though"}
{"text":"One of my favorite greek places in Vegas. It is a little overpriced in my opinion, but you get a loooot of good food when you order a kebab plate.  2 chicken kebabs, rice, hummus, cucumber salad, & pita bread. The lunch specials help to not break the bank as much. Always great customer service and nice ambience inside."}
{"text":"When I wanted a decent meal or healthy food while at school I went here. It's across the street from UNLV so it's convenient. I like the spinach pie- I won't attempt to spell it right now- and one of their salads. I cal ahead to order to pick up. The attitude of the workers aren't the most cheerful when I go to pick up. I never went it when it was busy but perhaps sometimes it is."}
{"text":"I bookmarked this place a couple of weeks ago when the other location was featured as a ROTD- this location was by an upcoming work training, so I penciled it into my schedule and grabbed lunch here today.

Prior to going, I read the reviews and perused the online menu, ultimately deciding on the chicken shwarma plate- I'm a huge fan of the dish and it seems like few places get it right. When I heard another review mention the garlic sauce this one is served with, I thought for sure I'd found a new favorite place worth the drive. And the rather-high $12 price.

When I arrived today, I was distinctly underwhelmed.
Location was hard to find from the street- drove past it twice because the Stephano's part of the roadside sign does not stand out, and it is partnered with the word GYROS rather than the actual name of the restaurant itself.

But when I got in, I was the only one there, and the guy who took my order looked like he'd rather be anywhere else but in that restaurant. Order was taken with about 5ive total words spoken total. 

Order was out quick. Food was lukewarm, but plentiful. I still had hope.
Dug into the chicken and the quality was good, but the sauce I had so been looking forward to was a little runny and chalky- not at all what I wanted. Garlic flavor was very light, and the sauce seemed more like a tzatziki than anything else.  The salad was good, the hummus was okay and portions of everything were plentiful, which justified the $12 price. Pita was soft and warm, too, but a bit flavorless. But the chicken shwarma dish is just not what I'd hoped it would be."}
{"text":"I live right up the street so when cooking dinner isn't on the menu Stephano's is! I get the 1/4 or 1/2 chicken plate for me and my 9 and 4 year old and a side of falafel switch out the Israeli salad for extra hummus order a side of extra pita and it's plenty for us to share! Always a consistent taste but sometimes the wait to get good even when you order ahead can be a little much. I wonder if they forget to put it in sometimes. Either way the food is good enough for me to keep returning. Their passion tea is unsweetened and amazing so that's always a must!"}
{"text":"What I did:
Went in, Checked in with Yelp, Got a free side by checking in with the app, ordered a combo plate, and a baklava. Ate. Ordered two Baklavas

What I should have done:
Sat in my car, Bought the yelp deal 15 for 20, Went in, ordered a combo plate, not used the free side, stack on baklavas till it totalled to 20 dollars. Drove off with a satisified belly and a bag full of sweet sweet baklava 

Man oh man if i had employment near the strip i'd totally eat at Stephano's a lot more often. I've been meaning to hit up Stephano's after trolling their booth at the 89XXX elite event what...two years ago? Yeah two years ago, it's been a while with Operation Enduring Freedom and all i just never had a chance to go.

Whoa the food is good. The Gyro is a lamb and beef blend. Would have loved for it to just be lamb but they do it right. They slice the gyro meat from the huge rotating hunk of gyro meat then they grill it some more to char the sides just to give it a fresher taste. Bravo guys and gals at Stephano's BRAVO!!

Their options of condiments is just Aladeen...Sriracha AND Tapatio?!? 

If gas prices were cheaper I would GLADLY make the trek toward the UNLV campus just to grab me a Gyro."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place like this and im extremely excited that its 2 minutes from work (mind you i did find this place on my lunchbreak) and on my side of town! Chicken kabob platter is so delicious the meat is tender n juicy, cooked just right and i love love love how fresh the israeli salad is and hummus. pita served hot and the garlic sauce is amazing, i spread it on the kabob. I will be bringing my family here, it's definitely one of my faves now! Two thumbs up to AMAZING food!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst Mediterranean places I've been to.I ordered an order of hummus, falafel, and a chicken schwarma. First off, the chicken schwarma was horrible. It was like taking chicken from Taco Bell, add some shriveled tomatoes and some tahini on artificial pita bread, and you've got yourself the ideal American version of this traditional wrap. They don't even know how to make a schwarma!!! The falafel was so salty and grainy...and if you've had great falafel before, you would know that Stephano's version is just crap. The hummus had NO FLAVOR whatsoever. I will never go back again. As a matter a fact, go right around the corner to Jerusalem Grill on Flamingo and Decatur. Now that place knows how its done, freshly-made food that won't put a hole in your wallet. I swear coming from back east and Europe, people don't really know what good food is around here. Best Mediterranean place I've tried thus far here in this town!"}
{"text":"The good- free baklava was excellent. Free diet Coke with the meal was good. Wheat pita was very good. 
The meh- humus was too salty and garlicky but tasted ok on the wheat pita. 
Israeli salad was pretty good. 
The not good- the falafel pita wrap was not to my liking. A little small for the money, and falafels neither tasty nor crunchy-but if it were excellent falafel, I'd have no problems with the size. 
Counter help-I couldn't help feeling like \"hurry up and order, and get out\". 

All in all- better options for me. No reason to come back."}
{"text":"Great mediterranean food and super fast delivery!  Huge menu and really nice staff."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is amazing and I always get delivery and it's been great everytime.  Very friendly and fast delivery."}
{"text":"The gyros are good. Not great. I love places that can offer a Greak salad as an option for a combo and this place is NOT that. I was given the option of a full Greek salad so I opted for the mediocre fries. I will say that the customer service is better than most order at counter type places. Over all, it's not a bad place."}
{"text":"This place has quickly become one of our go-to restaurants. Everything we have tried has been delicious: chicken kabobs, veggie kabobs, lamb, hummus, falafel. The decor is stylish, the staff is friendly, and the service is relatively quick for food grilled to order. We love it!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Plates are generous but prices are high for self serve and plastic plates. $13 for giro plate with rice, salad, humus, and two whole pita bread. Plenty of seating in typical fast food environment."}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes for one simple meal. When I asked the girl how much longer do I have to wait at the 20 min mark, she said 5 mins. She stated the chicken has to cook for 10 minutes. No one was in the restaurant. It's a fast food restaurant. 25 minutes for a meal is too long."}
{"text":"I meant to write a review when I visited a while ago but was so happy I forgot! The food was pretty good. I am biased when it comes to falafel as I have a great place I go to in California where I live but every time I am out here I make it a point to get their falafel and the great thing was with their lunch special I could get the falafel as a side to the chicken schawarma sandwich! The only problem I had was the garlic sauce was a little runny but other than that I will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been to the location across from UNLV more than a few times and loved their food! So when this place opened closer to my home I was very excited. This location is so nice! They have quirky and modern tables and chairs, lights hanging from the ceiling, could be quite a romantic setting at night. 

I always get the gyro plate or bowl. The rice cooked in chicken broth is so delicious! The greek salad is awesome, large chunks of cucumbers and tomatoes mixed in their homemade sauce, hummus with soft and hot pita bread. The food here is amazing and is consistent every time. 

Will definitely come back for more rice and gyros!"}
{"text":"I eat at Stephanos about once a week & the food is really good. I normally order a Greek salad with traditional dressing which is wonderful. Watch out for the olives in this salad though! They are not pitted, and I nearly broke a tooth biting into one. I also occasionally order the Greek grilled cheese which is really original! It's cheesy goodness grilled in between two pitas. 

I normally have a pretty decent experience as far as customer service goes, but my most recent visit left a very bad impression. I ordered a Greek salad to go. When I got home I realized they had forgotten to give me any dressing (the dressing is the best part in my opinion). I called the restaurant and waited 15 minutes for someone to answer the phone. After no one answered I eventually hung up. I figured the restaurant was probably busy, so I ended up driving back to pick up the missing salad dressing. When I finally got back, the restaurant was dead. Only 2 couples were seated and had already finished eating. There was no reason that they did not answer the phone. When I got to the cash register, the girl working barely acknowledged me. When I finally got her attention I asked if I could please get some dressing as it had been forgotten in my take out order. She sort of just tossed the dressing at me and turned away. No apology and a super big attitude. 

As I stated before, I eat here about once a week. After this experience, however, I will most likely not come back to Stephanos."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Stephano's as shown by the amount of time I spend there weekly! They have a nice variety of Greek/Mediterranean food as well as other dishes such as a Nutella pita bread (which I need to try asap), but I always order the chicken Kabab with rice, hummus and pita bread and it never disappoints. In addition to the amazing food, the service is just as great. Sophie, who is always there when I come in is super friendly and knows me by name and order which shows she cares and pays attention to her customers."}
{"text":"Delicious, warm, soft, chewy pita and amazing rice. Little things but it's those little things that make a difference. Overall one of the best Mediterranean places around!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch and I must say... I liked everything! The place has a lot of seats and it is kept really clean from my experience. The employees were friendly and answered any questions. I needed a good meal before my workout, so I ordered the chicken kabob plate. They give two kabobs with rice and salad. You can also get pita bread and hummus with it as well. The meal cost around $13 and the portions were very good for the price! I enjoyed the chicken as it was cooked very well and tender! Some places tend to overcook the chicken where it becomes dry. The pita was fresh and they gave plenty hummus! I would definitely order this again as it helps me stick to my diet. Give this place a try if you're in the area you won't regret it. Don't forget if you check in you get a free piece of baklava."}
{"text":"Good food and quantity for the money, the falafel and Lebni are absolutely recommended. The customer service left me a bit annoyed however.... the guy taking our order kept misunderstanding what we were saying and then getting really mouthy about it before we could clear the misunderstanding. Happened twice during our order... then our buddy got his food in a couple minutes and me and my wife waited for almost a half hour for ours to come out. I actually had to go searching for someone, when I walked up to the kitchen, there was no one there... pretty sure a smoke break was taken in the middle of our food being made. Not ok. When they realized it they had to ask us what we had ordered and then he gave us an extra baklava for the trouble. Not really sure I'd want to go back with places like Kabob Grill around... WAY better customer service for about the same quality Med food."}
{"text":"If I could give Stephano's 500 stars I would. I think we have eaten here about a dozen times and each time is even better than the last. Salads, gyros, plates, chicken it's all amazing. It's just a myriad of flavors that don't stop delighting your tastebuds. Fresh hot pita bread, the cool creamy tzatsiki sauce, the flame grilled chicken, beef & lamb, the crisp salads, smooth & dreamy hummus, the luscious feta cheese, oh and that garlic sauce! Is it possible to have too much good stuff on the menu?? Yep! But wait!! As good as everything is, there's one particular side item that wows me almost more than anything else. It's the Israeli salad. Oh my god I could eat it by the bucket full. Such a simple salad but the flavor is a knockout. We love everything about Stephano's especially the fact that's it's only 5 minutes from home. 

I know people marry for money, fame & fortune but listen Stephano, I'd marry you based solely on your amazing recipes. Call me."}
{"text":"Whenever I have a craving for zankou in California I come to Stephanos. I was so excited to hear that they opened one closer to my house than the one next to unlv. 

My favorites are the chicken or the filet mignon bowls. 

I love that they offer wheat pita bread and their garlic sauce is to die for. Super garlicky just how I like it. 

One of the best if not the best Mediterranean food spots in vegas."}
{"text":"Good. On my first experience the customer service was a little bored but it definitely got better after that. Food is very good."}
{"text":"This place is insanely good! My go to plate is the chicken shawarma bowl with the lentil rice as a substitute for regular rice. Its the best!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a gyro salad for lunch. The only thing special about it was the fact that it gave me a bad stomach ache, dizzy spells and other gross symptoms associated with bad handling of food. Thank you, Stephanos, for giving me two extra days off of work this week."}
{"text":"Amazing! Food was delicious and super fresh. Loaded chicken shwarma fries are where it's at. And the baklava is to die for!"}
{"text":"LOVE!!! The food here is awesome. Still thinking about it...Paymons eat your heart out cause you aren't even close. Not that I ever thought it was good anyway....hehe :)"}
{"text":"Excellent menu with lots of great and healthy options  for my family and vegetarian wife. My kids loved the falafel, and the tri-tip steak bowl was great. We came for an early dinner--a good thing since they close at 6 p.m. during UNLV's Spring break (until April 6). Free baklava with Yelp check-in!"}
{"text":"The pita is doughy and heavy.  My son didn't like the gyros.  The falafel was crispy and had nice flavor, but the pita was very dry and the tiziki sauce has no flavor.  Quick & friendly service but the food was not good enough to come back"}
{"text":"My favorite Mediterranean restaurant delicious beef shawerma, french fries and when you check in with Yelp you get a free baklava...thank you Stefanos it was yummy"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since I live nearby. The place is clean and has a simple decor. I got the lunch special steak and chicken kabobs. It comes with rice, Israeli salad, hummus and pita bread. Lunch specials come with a free drink before 3pm . The portion size was good and the food was nicely seasoned. The little sides of garlic butter and tzatziki sauce were great. I left feeling very satisfied. This place will definitely be included into my \"go to\" rotation."}
{"text":"Their filet minon everything is delicious!!! I was skeptical about trying this place since Greek food is hit or miss for me. I've been here twice the past week and both visits surpassed my expectations. I love the open kitchen layout and the cleanliness of this location."}
{"text":"My favorite Mediterranean grill in Las Vegas! The rice is to die for and the meats, salads, and hummus are on point. Definitely would recommend if your craving some Greek/Mediterranean."}
{"text":"We ordered this place at the hospital and it was paid by our very generous doctor working with us.  It was probably $200 or more all together.  The delivery guy was standing and waiting about 5-10 minutes for his payment. The doctor was with a patient. The delivery guy was yelling at the staff about how long it was taking-he was also yelling in a different language.  When the doctor came, the delivery guy yelled at him too! The doctor even tipped him.  When we called the restaurant, they offered a $3 coupon on a $200+ order.  I wouldn't order from them again, that's no way you treat your customers.  
The good is good though.  They could make their portions larger though."}
{"text":"My family and I decided we wanted gyros and kebabs for lunch so we Yelped some options around our location.  We found a place that looked good so we went, sat and waited for nearly 10 minutes for service.  Completely disappointed by the lack of it, we opted to leave and try another place we had seen up the street on our way to our original destination.  On a fluke, we happened upon Stephano's Greek & Mediterranean Grill and we couldn't have been happier or more pleasantly surprised by the speed of service, quality of food and friendliness and professionalism of the staff during our visit for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  Kudos to you guys - we're totally coming back here now that we've found you!"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times and have always had great service and great food. I have stuck with the same things each time just because they are so good. The chicken and the filet kabob plates are both awesome.  The meat is perfectly cooked and not dry like many other places I have been.  The staff is also friendly and prompt so that even in a time crunch I can stop in and get great food 

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is everything of what's expected out of a Greek restaurant, amazing food, great atmosphere, and great clientele, they were so kind to us and made sure we had everything we needed more than once. They obviously care about how their customers feel in their space that's provided and it shows, big time."}
{"text":"they're food is amazing! Their fries are so delicious with the garlic sauce! I will most definitely come here quite often!"}
{"text":"It's not Mykonos or Athens or Santorini, but it's pretty damn close. The gyros are very good; meat is perfectly seasoned, pita is good and the sauce is wonderful. They have whole wheat pita, which is silly, as you'll never find that in Greece, but I guess so close to California, you have to do what you have to do. (Don't get me started on whole wheat pasta -- sham. No one in Italia will eat that!)  But the product is good, tasty, and well made. 

The Greek salad is Americanized with lettuce, which is a shame, but the taste is good.  The Israeli salad is very good, too. 

The baklava, which you get one free piece with check in, is excellent. 

Now...if they only had Greek Frappé!"}
{"text":"Came here based on the recommendation of my coworkers who come here quite frequently. 

Had a great lunch with the wife at this spot today. I went with the half chicken (white meat), fries (instead of salad), rice, hummus, wheat pita. 

Chicken was moist, fries were awesome, pita wasn't dry, hummus tasted homemade for sure, and rice was good. Absolutely no complaints. 

I've been to other places in this shopping center and they're kinda old looking inside. This place looked like when I stepped inside, I landed in a Summerlin shopping center. Very nicely done, Stephano's. 

The wife went with another chicken dish and she said it was also delicious. I/we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. This is one of my favorite Greek places. I love the filet mignon and chicken kabobs. Everything is seasoned super well and taste amazing. I really like their feta fries. They are incredibly addicting. I ordered Stephanos for a small gathering we had and everyone enjoyed the food. I was worried it wouldn't be enough food. But the meat platter (size small) was the perfect size for about 6 of us. It came with rice and pita. I also ordered two orders of the feta Fries and everyone was satisfied."}
{"text":"Sophie is a gem!! Very helpful and so kind! Best Greek and Mediterranean food come through to Stephano's!!"}
{"text":"Good food, decent prices
Also doubles as a hookah lounge 
Beer selection is good for a location this small"}
{"text":"The food in this place is amazing the Israeli salad is crazy good and they have a collection of some of the best beers in the world. Please do yourselves a favor and pair up some beer and food. It makes it a who new experience."}
{"text":"The last time I had Stephano's was during my undergrad years at UNLV many years ago. But thank you for opening one in the SW area. 

I've had many different plates here but one dish/plate that I truly enjoy is the beef shawarma plate. If you buy the lunch special, it comes with a drink. 

Oh yeah, check in and you'll get a free baklava.

Def hits the spot when I'm craving Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I live close to this place and really wanted to like it more.  I like the restaurant itself.  Has a very warm and inviting feeling to it.  You order at a counter, it's not a sit down and have someone take your order kinda place.   

For a gyro and didn't find it to be very flavorful.  A little bland for my taste buds.  

We also got some cheese appetizer thing.  That was a lot better.   

Sorry about the vague review.  Not saying don't try the place.  It's got 4.5 stars from a lot of people.  This is just one guys opinion.   But like I said, no my fav gyro.   And that's the main thing I came for."}
{"text":"So so so damn good. More than ample portions, the gyro beef and lamb were the best I've ever had and I've eaten a lot of gyros."}
{"text":"The Skinny: decent eats for very reasonable prices... kudos on the garlic sauce (I love toum!) (3) counter service: pretty friendly and quick (3) value: plates are large and filling and provide good value (3).

We've been on a Mediterranean bent lately. After a lengthy doctor's appointment, the hubs and I decided to hit Stephano's for a quick fast casual tuck in.

I got the chicken shawarma combo plate (with a side of toum - or delicious garlic sauce) while the hubs got the gyros combo plate. We came during lunch hours, so we each got a free drink! Sweet! 

They have a small selection of fountain drinks available. The hubs got some unsweetened ice tea while I just got some water with lemon. The drink station also sports some self-service pickles as well as fresh slices of lemon to go with your meal.

The combo plate comes with a sizable portion of hummus and Israelis salad and two slices of pita bread. At $11.93, these plates really fill you up! When I got my plate, there was a huge amount of meat on there. The amount of meat on the hubs gyros plate could have easily made up two sandwiches.

Both meats were caramelized off the spit and kind of grilled again to give it that charred flavor which I love. The beef/lamb gyro meat however was a bit blander for me and could have used a bit more spices. The chicken shawarma was a tinge too salty but when mixed in with other things, it was okay.

The Israeli salad was okay and perhaps a little over marinated the time I went. The hummus, although filling, didn't have enough lemony bite to it and was only okay in my books. The toum (or garlic sauce) is great! Would have asked for some more because it totally reminds me of the awesome Mediterranean joints in Dearborn, MI. The tzaziki was okay - nothing spectacular. The baklava was pretty generic so I would probably pass on that.

It's basically a counter service joint but the food is prepared to order and tastes pretty fresh. Prices for the amount of food is very reasonable and the staff is pretty friendly despite us taking a few minutes to decide what we wanted(they have a pretty big menu). I wouldn't necessarily make a trip out here specifically to eat at this joint but if I was in the area and felt like Mediterranean, I'd certain give it another go."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's right by my obgyn so we ate here all the time after my doctor visits when I was pregnant. And now our pediatrician is close to it! I always get the steak pita wrap with french fries. Their fries are the best I've ever had!!!!! And they have this special fry sauce it's so bomb. You can also get like loaded gyro fries or feta fries,and the baklava is killer!!"}
{"text":"My first time coming in the store I was greeted immediately with a warming welcome the food was mind blowing good! I enjoy ever bite of it, I'll be definitely coming back very soon."}
{"text":"If you are going to offer paninis, you should have a panini press! To be fair, I shouldn't have tried their newest offering. When has the newest offering ever lived up to the reputation of whatever made a restaurant good in the first place? This \"panini\" came on a squished subway or hoagie bun. TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"Ordered the Lamb Wrap and it did not disappoint.  I can seriously say it's one of the best I had so far.  The fries that came with the order was a pleasant surprise.  It was crispy and light.  I don't know why I haven't eaten at this place before but I will be back next time I'm visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"1 star for the garlic sauce- it's the weakest garlic sauce I've ever tasted there was no flavor at all!!!!!!!! 

4 stars for the service and the food. Everything tasted great we use to drive all the way to eastern to eat at Stephanos im so excited they finally open one by our house!  PLEASE TWEAK the garlic sauce I don't believe it ever tasted so bland before!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night for their soft opening. I love their Maryland Parkway restaurant, so I had high hopes for this location since it's much closer to my home.

The decor is much more conventional. None of the comfier seating options like they have at their Maryland location. But since I'm here to eat and not lounge around, it's not of concern to me. It's not a small space, but I can see them needing more seating once word gets around about their new place.

It's a friendly and efficient you order and they bring you your food type of arrangement. We ordered the Lamb Shank plate and the Chicken Kabob plate. Both plates came with delicious hummus, pitas, Israeli salad and rice. The lamb shank was accompanied by sauce covered mushrooms and carrots. Delicious. The chicken kabob was served with some kind of SCRUMPTIOUS garlicky butter. It was like cocaine in butter form.

There are many very good Greek restaurants in the area, some even closer to my home, but none of those have the variety of foods that Stephano's has. Definitely a good deal on really good tasting food. You won't regret giving them a try."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  The food is absolutely delicious and for a very fair price.  Make sure you try the loaded gyro fries, it is to die for!"}
{"text":"Great food. You can make healthy choices. We frequent this restaurant at least once a week!"}
{"text":"great authentic good!
excellent menu choices 
Love to eat lunch here!
Thank you Stephano"}
{"text":"Delicious Food, had the steak kabob and it was fantastic... i could have ate the rice alone it was also super delicious! Def going back!"}
{"text":"Our office eats Stephano's almost once a week and it's awesome. I've never had a bad lunch from Stephano's and they have quick delivery"}
{"text":"First time here and not familiar with Greek food at all, the server was really patient and made my experience very pleasant. Ordered chicken kebab Greek salad and pita gyro, very tasty! He even let me try hummus since I have never had it before, did not order it though cuz I did not like the taste. We will absolutely come back!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, the falafel was pretty dang good!  The pita that came with the falafel plate was a little disappointing.  Cut in half and stuck together, I really couldn't use it to make a falafel pita.

This is the first order-at-the-counter establishment I have been to that use those little vibrating coasters to tell you when your order is ready.  Good idea, no yelling out numbers or mispronouncing someone's name. But the damn thing scared the crap out of me!

The food took a lot longer to come out than I thought it would, but the light and fluffy falafel was worth the wait.  I'll be back to try more dishes, including the vegetarian moussaka, which I find intriguing. Maybe I just got a bad batch of pita."}
{"text":"Yep.  This is it.  VERY good food!  It's not quite as good as my favorite place (the REAL Yanni's at Silverado Ranch and LVB), but it's damn tasty and much closer.  The staff is very cool.  I would suggest the gyro or chicken.  The beef shawarma was a little chewy, overdone and not spiced too well.  Honestly, that's the only thing I've had that wasn't REALLY good.  The hummus is SPOT ON!  The salads are great.  Just GO!"}
{"text":"Great food, great people, great prices!

I come here for lunch quite often because of its convenience. It's located just down the road from the office and they're super quick so I don't have to worry about getting back too late. Everyone that I've run into here is super friendly. They greet you as soon as you walk into the door. Their menus are located near the entrance or you can walk up to the register to order. It can be quite busy during lunch time but they're quick with orders. Once it's placed, they'll give you a number to take to your seat. 

I've gotten a few things from the menu. My favorite is any of the rice bowls. It's usually enough food for at least two meals for me. Comes with a soda too. The Israeli salad is amazing and the tzatziki sauce is to die for! Sometimes I order an extra side to dip pita into. Yum!

Also, don't forget to check in for free baklava!"}
{"text":"This place is where it's at for some quick and delicious Mediterranean food. Staff is really friendly and they have a variety of authentic choices on the menu. I stop in at least once a week to have some of the beef and lamb gyro."}
{"text":"I'm volunteering for a local government park and helping to build a civilian road to a geological site. My \"boss\" had never been here but I've been to the location near unlv so I suggested we try this one together.

It's a little different setup then the other location I've been to. I'm not sure why but when I get to the register to order, I'm always overwhelmed with the options. This location at least has pictures of the plates but that still doesn't seem like enough. Everything kind of looks the same in the pictures and the descriptions are long so when I feel the person behind me breathing down the back of my neck, it gets a little frustrating trying to decide if you don't already know what you want. It's almost like it should be a server type restaurant with seating and menus.

Here's the catch though...I've been here several times and whatever I order is good so maybe it doesn't even really matter what I choose. I just feel like there are different things I would like to try but I don't really have the time to look. I don't even really know what I order because I just point and pay. And that seems fine.

Which comes to the only other thing to discuss, the price. It is a lot of food with lunch box type plate meaning you get a little of everything but it costs like a sit down server type restaurant averaging around $13-$17 per plate. Very worth the price though but be hungry because it's a lot for one sitting. 

I'm happy with this place but I'm just giving my review of what I notice and what other might read."}
{"text":"Today I ordered Kofta wrap and feta fries. don't know which of these items took so long to prepare but it was 20 minutes before i got my food.  I know it was something I ordered because others who came in after me were receiving their  food quickly.  One person even finished eating and left before I had my food. So I guess if you're in a hurry ask before you order. Everything was fresh and hot though and good. Enjoyed the feta fries and the fry sauce more than I expected.  Restaurant got very busy the further into the lunch hour that i"}
{"text":"So I picked up my regular order of kebab plates and was so upset that they changed their hummus... why would you do that??? Don't know if I will be back. 

The chicken kebab plate was the best I've ever had. The hummus was fresh and the chicken was juicy. Really excited to make this my go-to spot."}
{"text":"back in the golden days of when it was called \"the daily chicken\" arises a new place of franken lamb/beef meat called STEPHANO\"S! their food is still good and i still see the old dude still working there. im sure hes the owner. either that, he really likes their hummus enough to work there for over 10 years. all of their dishes are really good. i usually get the lamb/beef plates. their tablouleh is pretty good too. yay for shiracha. ive had better hummus. never tried their hooka though."}
{"text":"I love rustic themes to places and this one has exactly what I love. The outside area is too cute to handle and their tziki is so addicting! I convinced my mom to let me splurge there one night and we all agreed whenever we crave Greek food, we're coming here."}
{"text":"They should name another Greek Goddess Stephano!! I was really impressed with the food at Stephanos. I even came back second time just make sure not dreaming or delirious. Lol! Really the thing that stood out for me was just about the whole experience from the five star service, food, and great atmosphere dine in. My first visit tagging along with another first timer Suzy H. I went with the beef and lamb gyro plate, Talk about HUGE portion size. I was like really dam this is awesome!! Once I digging in every component was delicious! Hummus has always been measuring stick comes to Mediterranean food for me. The Hummus was spot on awesome. The consistency was perfect, tasted fresh made, and my meaning  fresh creamy texture, thick, use fresh garbanzo beans start with not ones out of can. (Trust me had bad Hummus nothing worst), The israeli salad is bomb comes to side salad. Talk about refreshing! It basically diced cucumbers and tomatoes but the vinaigrette or whatever dressing tossed in brings it all together. Light, refreshing, healthy, and perfect compliment with the plates. The gyro meat was tasty. It had great flavor could eat the meat by itself or with tzatziki sauce. You get decent size portion of meat. The pita bread was hate say it again but tasty stuff. You have option of white or wheat. Pita stands out is nice thick bread not flat or thin pita bread. So really perfect bread load up anyway heart desires, and you never need to worry about the bread falling apart on you. Awesome plate for lunch!!! 

The second visit tried one of the bowls this time tri=tip shawerma bowl. Talk about portion size! It was loaded with tri-tip, israeli salad, and rice. All the same things that stood out the first time did again the second time. 

Some little things that enjoyed about Stephano. Lunch specials plate or bowl get free drink. Surprising cause not many places know that offer free drink with any meal. No silly not talking alcohol but fountain drink. In the fountain area couple pickled options that can take as much as you want. I like the jalapeño. Warning it thick cut your one pieces does the trick for me. Another tasted like daikon or something white match stick cut pink in color. Not fan. I think great option they also offer for free. 

The service the gentlemen working the counter great job explaining everything for first timers, friendly, and great service. 

The dining area not all that big. Still nice relaxing atmosphere on top of fact it open kitchen so if need entertainment watch your food being made to order. 

Great value for your price. Great service. Awesome food! What else is there to justify five star review. LOL!!"}
{"text":"I think the coolest part of this restaurant is the back section where the seats are wide and padded. It even includes pillows! I never use them because who knows who has touched them - but I always sit back here. I enjoy unique things and I it isn't often you see seating like this. Weirdly enough when I went here today for lunch it was pretty full but no one was back here, so it also felt secluded so we could talk. 

I got a gyro bowl, which is basically: rice, Israeli salad, and lamb. Pita comes on the side and I got a free baklava for checking in on Yelp, sweet! I could have got a gyro plate which comes with all the same things minus rice, but I really love the Israeli salad and you get more of it in the bowl. I ordered a side a fries which would normally come with a gyro - so basically what I am saying is I overate. As usual my eyes are larger than my stomach. 

Conviently located across from UNLV, I have been here several times before and I am sure I will be back again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. I really like their chicken and the shrimp kabobs. Food is always fresh and hot."}
{"text":"I just eat here and I really don't know what all the good reviews is about. I was starving so I stop by.. we ordered chicken shawarma and lamb for 40.00$ the chicken was very dry and tasted weird . The lamb was disgusting, looks really old.
I've to say that usually I don't eat food that looks weird but I was so hungry so I took the risk. This was big mistake I've got diarrhea and stomach flu, and been 5 days home. Somebody have to inspect this guys are dangerous!"}
{"text":"Been here about 8 times now and have never been disappointed. Gyro plate is delicious as is the kofta.  The meats always have a great grilled flavor to them.  The baba ganoush is superb.  The desserts are all home made and are excellent...the baklava (best I have ever had), rice pudding, crème brulee (super rich).  The desserts also come in little sizes which are both inexpensive and good for hitting the spot without overdoing it.  Could not believe it would be as good as it is when I read all the reviews before I went the first time, but now I am just upset I did not start going sooner."}
{"text":"These no carb chicken dinner with salad soooo delicious and full of flavor.. My fiancé got there gyro he said it was really good of course we will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Always eat here when they send out the buy 2 get 1 free coupon.  Meat is very good.   Great rice.  Love the garlic sauce they give with the Pita  bread."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but for every good thing there was a not so good thing too. 
Good:
The cucumber and tomato salad was fresh and flavorful
The hummus was creamy and great tasting
I enjoyed the rice and thought it was different from any other Mediterranean place I'd been. 
Bad:
They were out of white pita bread and French fries. It was 5 pm on a Sunday so not like we were there right before closing or anything?? (how can a Mediterranean restaurant be out of pita?)
The falafel was super over-fried and just not good at all. 
The ambience in the restaurant was a little odd. It was super quiet and I felt like the employees were all in a fight where no was talking or something. Just not a welcoming environment. 
Anyway, maybe they were just off their game tonight who knows? Not likely that I will come back."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Favorite Greek Restaurant in southern Nevada. Customer service was decent. Atmosphere was cozy."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, good variety, always fresh & best baklava I've ever had.  Prices are reasonable, large servings & food is cooked to order.
I have NEVER had cold or stale food"}
{"text":"I have eaten there twice, it was awful both times and took forever considering is basically fast food. I just live up the street and Khory's was there previous to this place. I now drive the 20 minutes for Khory's because it's so much better."}
{"text":"Favorite Greek spot in town. Best gyros and platters! I always get my meal with a side of creamy greek dressing. You won't be disappointed. So dang good"}
{"text":"Pricey and average taste.Also staff not friendly.They dont want to give enough information about the foods.They are like eat and go out."}
{"text":"It's time I review this place. I can't speak for the ambiance because I've probably ordered Stephano's via Postmates at least 20+ times & my order has always been perfect. But I don't return for the meticulous arrangement of necessities, the food is phenomenal. I ALWAYS get the gyro platter and it never lets me down. The gyro meat is flavorful & cooked to perfection, the rice is that yummy sticky rice, fresh produce, Liberal portions, Only negative I could say, Tazhiki Sauce could use a stronger cucumber flavor but couldn't deduct a star that. Always my go-to Greek food."}
{"text":"Everything here is good. The wait is a little longer than expected on busy days, but the food is excellent. I wish they would bring back the vegetarian moussaka. It was amazing, and I came more often when they had it."}
{"text":"Mmmmm mmm mmm is all I can say! I love Mediterranean food and I noticed Stephano's gyros at the end of my street and I have been wanting to try it.  I got the original bowl with beef n lamb over rice and Israeli salad (I got a side of feta) because it's absolutely delicious on everything but it all was really delicious...I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Man, I usually don't leave a review after the first visit but this place deserves it. I had the lamb & beef pita with a side of fries, as well as the creme brûlée and a free baklava for checking in. The pita wrap itself deserves the 5-star rating. The meat was nice and tender. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I went to try this place out because of all the yelp review.  Well, I would have to say this place is OK.  We went for lunch, nothing special.  We got some kebabs, falafel plate, and a chicken rice bowl. Everything tasted good, not great, not bad.  The guy at the counter was a bit stand offish.  Just make sure you check your receipt, cause he automatically assume we all wanted sodas and charged us for them without asking.  I did bring it to his attention & he gave us some free baklava, which was really good."}
{"text":"Food was very inexpensive and very good.  Haven't tried much greek places in the US but this place was close enough to Greece to me.  I just got the gyro combo, my wife got the gyro with cheese, and my daughter got the grilled cheese.  Quite good!  Combo portions are pretty generous!  If anything my wife says the gyro with cheese could have used more cheese.  She's a cheese lover haha"}
{"text":"Yum! Cool place to grab a quick lunch. Love the different options, even as a vegetarian."}
{"text":"If you want the best gyro and fries combo in town, go here. They have a big menu that looks good but I am so stuck on my combo that I don't know when I will venture out and get something else. 
I have been going to the Maryland location for over 10 years and only during lunch hours, so I could never have a beer with my meal. Now that they are open* next to my house in Henderson, I am looking forward to having one of their unique beer selections not found in many other local places. (*they told me on their soft opening that the beer will be available later in February). 

Best of luck to Stephano, Nick and the crew in Henderson!! In addition to making great food, you guys have made a very comfortable and inviting atmosphere to enjoy it. P.S. when I refer to your shop I still call it Daily Chicken."}
{"text":"Stephanos has been on my list of UNLV vicinity eats since I first wandered in a few years ago, tempted by the name. Yes it was because it had Steph in the name. 

As a vegetarian I can't personally vouch for the gyros, but my sometimes carnivore spouse loves the cheese gyros with lamb. I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!).

The restaurant itself is clean and spacious. Although I've never tried out the hookahs myself, I've often witnessed others enjoying them immensely. There are big tables/booths that are perfect for dining with a big group, as well as smaller tables for smaller gatherings. There are also a couple flat screen televisions that are usually tuned to sports or the news."}
{"text":"We are now regulars, ending up here at least once a week. 

The menu visibility issue has been resolved, although not in the way I expected! There are big laminated menus on the fence/divider as you walk in. We also grabbed one of the paper menus next to the register to take home. This way, menu perusal is easy, you can be out of the way of the line *and* there is no giant menu taking away from the gorgeous decor! Well done, Stephano's!

I continue to think that the gyro bowl is the cat's pajamas. SO stinkin' good! I keep meaning to try something else, but I just can't go without the warm pita, tangy tzatziki, succulent meat, amazing salad and that rice! I have dreams about that rice. It's a ton of food and will likely fill the belly of even the hungriest person. 

Stephano's has earned itself a top spot in the dinner-out rotation!"}
{"text":"An excellent take-out Greek restaurant. Food is excellent and tasty. From the gyros to the chicken kebabs with rice, from the hummus to the Israeli salad, you cannot go wrong! The wife and I order regularly from Stephano's, and have never been disappointed. Their service is outstanding and prompt."}
{"text":"Love me some gyros! 
Me and my husband went here to try it out and we're happy to find that they offer the gyros as a \"low carb-double protein\", since neither one of us are big bread eaters. The meat also had a really good flavor to it. 
The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the hummus we ordered. I felt it had a very bland flavor. 
Would go to again for my gyro craving!"}
{"text":"Mediocre, but good. The chicken is tasty as well as the rice! I just feel like I've had better. The service is so so. The restaurant seems decent, good amount of seating. A dark environment but relaxing nonetheless. Baklava was good!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, especially the Gyro plate. Growing up Greek with an amazing Mother who can prepare authentic Greek food, this is one of the first Greek Restaurants in Vegas that I really like. Great customer service as well and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Waited 45+ minutes for a salad. They had a take-out order that backed up dozen plus orders for all of us who were dinining in. The WORST part is that the owner was there the entire time, and never offered even an apology (let alone anything else). Some people were so fed up, and had to go back to work, they they left w/o even getting their food. Even then, there was not even an ounce of apology with the staff or the owner!!! HORRIBLE... And I used to love love this place! Will not go there again.  The service has been horrible the last several times I've gone there..."}
{"text":"Literally eat here every day! Lol i have no shame about it...they never disappoint! I always order the chicken kebab greek salad"}
{"text":"AKA daily chicken! Food's good, so is the hookah."}
{"text":"Great quick bite! The small fry is big enough for 2. The falafel is firm but fluffy and perfectly fills up a wrap- they go pretty aggressive on the sauce and raw onions, so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"You won't find good Middle Eastern restaurants in Vegas like this one. 
Tasty Falafel and good Tahini."}
{"text":"4 stars because the first time I had the beef shawarma wrap it was amazing. I came back and tried the beef and lamb gyro and it was equally amazing. But my last two visits i ordered the beef shawarma wraps again and then meat was extra salty. At first I thought it was just the cook for the day but after back to back tries of extra saltiness, I'm a little disappointed. I hope they fix it."}
{"text":"I always have an amazing meal when I go to Stephano's I love the falafel and gyro so I ask for a combo  the loyalty program they created is smart and effective. Makes me wanna go more to get my points. The baklava is amazing I went in and starting eating them like they were an appetizer then I caught myself and stoped  the chicken kebob is also amazing. The chopped salad that accompanied my meal was great too I love the hint of mint."}
{"text":"I love going to Stefanos it's just like my grandmother's cooking. The most tender chicken shish kebab in town!"}
{"text":"Decided to take my mom and sister here for a quick dinner before picking up somebody at the airport. According to all UNLV students, this place has the best fries in town and boy I think I have to agree with them though they were a little too generous with the seasoning. We tried the chicken gyro, falafel pita, and rib eye steak shawerma which were all delicious. I will definitely be back since the University is just across the street."}
{"text":"I love Greek food, its a nice way to change things up a bit, but so difficult to find a good place. When I saw that this place opened up down the street from my I got excited. First, second, third, fourth, ect. Experience has been amazing! Friendly staff, great food, reminds me of the food from the Greek festival where I used to live...authentic... Also the dipping sauce for the French fries is addicting. Can't wait to visit again. Which will be soon."}
{"text":"Updating my review: 
I had Stephanos again today. They fixed their garlic sauce and it's amazing again :)))) thanks for listening management! 


Stephanos has taken over the old Khourys. It's Bitter sweet because khourys had their amazing fresh pita bread and it was so convenient to home. Stephanos has amazing kabobs and falafels but store bought pita. 
I went into Stephanos today and ordered a chicken kabob and falafel combo plate & and a chicken and steak kabob combo plate. The food was amazing!! But I ordered and payed extra for their garlic sauce and it was bland and it just tasted like lard? I've had their garlic sauce before at the eastern location and I don't remember it being so bland and such a little amount! Luckily I went home and had some homemade garlic sauce that my sister makes! 
Other than that, everything else was exceptional! The food and service was great and I will be back for my quick fix of Greek Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"This food is great! Quality is on point and prices are fair. The location is the downside it isn't a nice place to sit and enjoy your meal but the food is good anyway. I will take out next time and enjoy it in the comfort of my own home or company. There are many options to choose from and sides aren't too expensive either."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch one afternoon and ordered the chicken schwarma combo (with fries and a drink). The price was around 11-12 dollars, which is typical for Greek food in the area. The menu was also pretty large, there were plenty of options. 

The decor was clean and the customer service was great. I was greeted upon entering the door and since it was my first time, the individual at the register was quick to give suggestions of the most popular items.

The food overall was pretty good. The fries were fresh and the schwarma had a unique blend of spices that stood out from the other Greek restaurants in the area. The meat was a little dry however, but not dry enough to ruin the overall experience. I would strongly recommend this place for lunch."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch time and they have a lunch special available - Free soft drink with any lunch combo. Portions are very generous and the meals come with pita bread, humus, a cucumber tomato salad and rice. I tried their 2 meat place (chicken shawarma & chicken kabob). For me the shawarma was a bit too fatty but I really liked the grilled chicken kabob. I recommend this place because I like the healthy plate options. The restaurant itself is a little small, and it might be a wait during lunch time because they get real slammed."}
{"text":"Stumbled here by chance because a restaurant I meant to go to nearby was closed, and I'm glad I did. I really enjoyed the food...so much that I had it almost once a week for a few weeks. But I noticed the quality started going down. Some days they're really good and fresh, but other days (likely at a time near closing) the food already seems old and dry. It's also kind of pricey for a quick spot to eat. I think the times I've really been satisfied/impressed is lunch time when the food tastes really fresh."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food hands down. Their Israeli salad is so tasty. I love their hummus and the customer service is amazing. When the weather permits, i love sitting outside in the patio. Its such a nice quiet place. Their steak is great and they have a variety of different plates. This is a must try place for any fan of Mediterranean food"}
{"text":"Food was just ok for me. I had the spinach pie plate. The spinach pie was a little hard to eat. The outside was super flaky and crispy and the inside was really mushy and burnt looking. I couldn't cut it without making a mess everywhere. My boyfriend had their chicken gyro and his chicken was all burnt. He had to take off all the burned parts before eating it. Overall, I enjoyed their israeli salad and fries. If you want real good greek food, Yassou is the best"}
{"text":"This is always my go to place when craving a really good rotisserie chicken with that garlic sauce. Reminds me of Zankou chicken in Glendale. The hip and trendy decor with delicious menu which is pretty extensive is needed in this area. 

Service, staff, food and ambiance A+++"}
{"text":"Great fresh food and fantastic for our 15U pre game basketball meal.  Clean and accommodating for a group!"}
{"text":"Came in at 2:50pm just in time to get a free drink with my chicken schawerma plate. The guy ringing me up totally spaced out and dropped the ball. I checked in to get the free baklava and he said he'd be right back and get it for me...he never came back. He also didn't give me a cup for my free drink. Ended up having to ask someone for it when I was given my food. The chicken was mediocre nothing special. There was no rice which was desperately needed. The hummus was plenty and the pita were thick. The plate as a whole was just okay, came with a tiny salad. $11.90 chicken plate, no baklava, no rice, and asked for my free drink. If there was a little bit more care in the customer service my experience would've been much better."}
{"text":"This is certainly my favorite Mediterranean food. The atmosphere is perfect and the food is always delicious. There is a huge variety of combo plates and I can't even pick my favorite one. As far as I know, this place is local to Las Vegas and I love supporting quality local businesses. Try the gyro fries!"}
{"text":"This is seriously the best place to get my Greek/Mediterranean fix in Vegas.  I always get the rib eye skewers and the grilled shrimp, but everything is very solid, you can't go wrong.  The owner Nick and the rest of the staff are very hospitable and friendly.  

Special hint for you foodies, try the Moussaka, so so good!!"}
{"text":"How is this place only 4 stars?!?!  Place is super clean unlike other kebob restaurants.  Staff always friendly and courteous.  Highly recommend the Kebob combo plate with steak and chicken.  If you're like me and can never decide, just get both!!!  

Always stopping by here if I'm in the neighborhood.  One of the best places in town."}
{"text":"Love the food!!!  We have been eating here since the day it opened!!  Favorite go to food is the feta fries!!!"}
{"text":"My go to place for a quick Mediterranean wraps or salad. Love the ambiance and mellowness, doesn't feel like everyone is having a stroke. Falafel wrap is my favorite here. You can also order online and pick up in store if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"This is a must. The wife and I have been here three times in two weeks fantastic food, service is great and portions are huge. Definitely a must go."}
{"text":"Yeah, the name's a little weird but that is of no concern - these people can make some seriously good food.  Gyros are, of course, their specialty, but they have an ample selection of shwarama, kabobs, various salads, and other Mediterranean delights.  They just remodeled as well from a small space that was basically a glorified, stationary gyros stand to a twice-the-size legitimate restaurant.

Their chicken kabob plate is astounding.  It includes some deliciously marinated and grilled chicken on a bed of rice with hummus, Israeli salad, pita and garlic sauce.  I make little packages of amazing deliciousness with the pita, garlic, hummus, rice and chicken.  It's nearly impossible to tell anyone how wonderful it really is.  It's my lunch comfort food.

There are so many fancy schmancy Mediterranean places every where.  Daily Chicken may not look like a whole lot, but they have the important stuff (great food, nice people) DOWN."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a week. Everything is great. I've tried almost everything chicken. I love the grilled chicken, chicken shawarma, falafel, spinach pie, dolmades, hummus, garlic sauce. I seriously love it. Free baklava with Yelp check in rocks and if you get a plate they offer a free drink. I usually order take out. And it's really nice that they remember your order when you call and give them your phone number."}
{"text":"Hard to find good shawarma, luckily I find myself close to this place often enough to get my fix."}
{"text":"Our usual Greek place we go to  in Henderson is closed on Sundays.  We got a craving for Greek food that day and decided to try Stephano's based on Yelp reviews.

Sadly, it did not compare to the reviews on Yelp.  Maybe it was a bad night.  Maybe it was at the end of a holiday weekend and the food was just running thin (two items we ordered turned out to be unavailable and substitutions and refunds needed to be made).  Or maybe we have just had better food and our expectations have been raised.

We ordered the whole chicken, the beef and lamb gyro plate, a side of baba ganoush, a rice pudding and a grilled tomato.

After ordering and paying for the meal, I was told that they were out of the grilled tomato and that they were out of the dark meat parts of the whole chicken.  They credited my account for the tomato and offered all white meat for the whole chicken . . . in other words 4 breasts with wing and no leg/thighs.

Well . . .the chickens breasts while seasoned nicely, they were terribly dry.  The beef lamb gyro meat was also dry and the edges were burnt.  The tzaziki was runny and tasted more like a ranch dip. And the rice pudding while it tasted OK, was a super small portion for $2.49.

On the rice pudding.  The usual Greek place we go to charges $3.49 for their version . . .but it is 4 to 6 times as large.  It also does taste better.

So . . .here is the summary of Pros and Cons

Pros:
Hummus is quite tasty
baba ganoush is also quite tasty
large amount of pitas included

Cons:
Slow service - took 30 minutes to get food after order
Chicken dry
Beef/Lamb dry, burnt and too much pepper
Israeli salad is horrible and over seasoned / marinated
Rice pudding while tasting ok, it is a VERY small portion
Food overall salty requiring water during the night
We still taste the food 12 hours after eating it (NOT GOOD)

In conclusion, I think we will keep our urges for Greek food away from Sundays and stick to our usual place also here in Henderson.  We really wanted to like you and were sad.  In fact, all three of us stated that if this was our 1st experience of Greek food, we would never order it again."}
{"text":"I love this place. I haven't had gyros this good since a little shop in Germany (Owned by a wonderful Turkish family) and the prices are fantastic! The music is fun and the sauce for your fries is better than Cane's sauce."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious, I usually get the grilled chicken plate or the gyro and they are always amazing. I definitely recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"we were in town for the Mountain West Basketball.championships.  We chose this place for it's proximity to the Thomas & Mack.  prices were good and the food is excellent.   it is not fancy.  you order at the counter.  food was well prepared and tasty.  I had the lamb shank and others had the lamb and beef gyro plate and the chicken gyro.  all were good."}
{"text":"We ate here as a family last Saturday. It was pretty empty at first, but some more came in as we were eating. The decor is nice.

The menu had plenty of choices.

Hubby, daughter, and myself all went for the gyro combo. I was very excited to see that a garlic sauce was on the menu and asked for that on the side. It was not garlic sauce. It was more of a cold chunk of garlic butter. 
We did have a choice of pitas...and I went for the wheat. It was very good. The fries were oversalted, but I rubbed it off.

Son ordered a gyro meat over rice with salad. It also came with a pita. We all tasted it and the salad mixed with the Greek rice was SO good! 
We'd love to go back another time when we're in town to try the falafels. 

Great food!

The only con was that it was freezing inside. Anyone can tell you that I don't get cold easily. It was cold in there!

I'm a tough customer when it comes to tzatziki sauce. This wasn't the greatest. It was like they forgot to season it. Where was the cucumber?  It was certainly lacking and needs improvement."}
{"text":"I love Greek food and They do not disappoint.   I like the 1/2 chicken!  all their sides and dips are stellar!  My next get together I will pick up dips and extra pita for appetizers!   It's setup more like a fast food place than restaurant, which is great for taking to go!  They have thus garlic spread that's pretty amazing if you love garlic!"}
{"text":"Stephano's offers tasty falafel, gyros, and hummus in a nice, relaxed atmosphere. They've got an impressive selection of imported beers by the bottle. This is a good place to stop for a satisfying lunch. I do wish they would adopt the standard \"fast casual\" service approach -- bringing your completed order to you, rather than expecting you to retrieve it at the counter. Real silverware (vs. plastic) would be good, too."}
{"text":"Great food, but a little on the pricey side for what you get.  But good news is they deliver to Seven Hills"}
{"text":"My new favorite for Mediterranean take out! Nice, clean and roomy to dine in if you like. Pricey but served a good portion for left overs. The vegetarian rice is great. The choices of flour vs wheat pita is nice. The meat is juicy and fresh tasting. Great service and great attitude by servers"}
{"text":"Ok, so the food is great. No debating that. 
Tonight I spent a bunch of $ on a big meal for my family, raving about Stephano's. They really couldn't deliver as they were busy so I picked it up with my daughter.

We asked the server to double check the order to make sure everything was there. She assured us that everything was there but really rushed us out. 

When we got home, we were missing many items that were listed on the receipt. We called the restaurant to alert them of the mistake and to have the missing items delivered. We where put on hold for quite some time then finally got Stephanie, the manager, on the phone whose first solution was to to credit the missing items. We had kids to feed so that was not an option. We asked Stephanie to please deliver the items to the house. She in turn said \"it'll cost you extra for delivery\". Flabbergasted, we just went to the restaurant to pick up the missing food. When we got there there was no urgency, concern or any hint of basic customer service. Very disappointing. Great food is great but great customer service tastes better. Stephano's, if you are reading this letter, you lost a customer. Hopefully you'll learn from this experience."}
{"text":"I am not a Mediterranean food expert but so far this place is pretty chill. Always friendly and on time. A cool chill spot to get some food that'll actually fill u up. 
I like to get their veggie platter that has hummus, tubule, grape leaf wrap, salad, pita bread, and spinach pie. Yes it's a lot of food for one person so I try and share each time I order it.  
If I am alone I order a ---- wrap but if I don't feel tol hungry I skip the wrap and order the ---- appetizer which is still a lot of food. The only thing I wish is For them to have more drink choices because their water does not taste good and I dont like sodas from the choices on the fountain.
I know they do hooka at night but I never smelled it in the air during the day, which is the time i usually go for lunch.
I've tried their greek salad before but I don't know if they forgot to give me dressing.. there was no sauce whats so ever so i had a very boring salad. And they forgot to give me my free Baklava for Checking in! :("}
{"text":"Great food!  Great people!  Super friendly service and a lot of food for our money!  It was a great place for lunch!  The hummus was clearly fresh and very delicious. I had shawarma and my wife had a Greek salad. We were both full and satisfied when we left and would definitely be back if we weren't from out of town!  Great place to visit if you want to get away from the strip for a bit while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Greek/Mediterranean food near UNLV. I just stopped by to grab lunch to go one day. They have some pretty awesome combos that looked really tempting but I really wanted to get the Spanakopita (Spinach Pie). However the Spanakopita combo came with 2 stuffed grape leaves and I wanted to try the kofta (ground beef) instead so I ordered them separately. You also get a free piece of baklava for checking in on yelp! 

The Spanakopita was disappointing. I've had really good spanakopita before and this was just average. it was too much dough and the dough was very crispy instead of flaky. The Kofta was good though. I regret not getting a Kofta combo or gyro instead. I would've liked to try the hummus side dish. Next time I suppose! The baklava was a nice sweet little treat after my meal!"}
{"text":"Me and my friends love to come to Stephano's for some lunch after our basketball workouts or study sessions at school. They have 3 convenient locations around town and all of them happen to be either close to work, school, or home. Their food tastes great, and they have the best garlic feta fries in town."}
{"text":"Best gyro I've ever had (and I've had quite a few)

Spoke to the owner himself- very nice and humble. 

Workers were also great

Interior of the joint was also very classy and tastefully done

All in all amazing experience where I might just have to eat every Saturday or Sunday for lunch"}
{"text":"I've eaten gyros here before and really liked the lamb so when my Dad had a lamb shank craving I suggested this spot. We saw the pics on Yelp and my Dad was immediately sold. Unfortunately the pics that people posted were much more flattering. The lamb shank we received was bone dry and not the moist sauced one in the pictures. The gyros are still good but I would skip the lamb shank."}
{"text":"Baklava was delicious! The taziki sauce ruined the gyro.  The gyro had the sauce onions and tomatoes nothing special.  The other review was right the fries are like Burger King fries.  I thought the review was being overly critical saying it was like a fast food place, but it totally was.  There are a lot of Greek places in town where you order and pay at the counter, but this truly reminds you of a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried it today, the food was not too bad, certain dishes were better than the other the filet mignon steak was super tasty but their chicken was kinda disappointing and dry. Although the portions were generous the price seems a little overpriced for the quality of chicken I got."}
{"text":"Delicious - decided to give this place a try based and the reviews and it exceeded expectations!  I had the 1/4 chicken with hummus, pita, rice and salad.  All of it was fresh and tasty.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love greek food and took my mom and aunt there, my mom has never had greek food. Decided on this place, because my favorite place (Ambrosia) closed and all the good reviews.

Food was Ok. We had the dolmas (good) falafel (good) gyro (meh) and a combo with chicken (very dry) and Kofta (burned, dry and tasteless). The Israeli salad on the combo was very good.

When we got our drinks, we noticed a slimy liquid at the bottom (overflow) of the soda machine. We hoped the top of the machine where the soda comes out was better.

It was not awful but there are a lot more places to choose from.
I will not go back."}
{"text":"All about the feta fries! Nothing compliments their gyros quite like their feta fries! Crispy, seasoned fries with cheese baked on top with their secret sauce and tzatziki to dip in! Heaven!"}
{"text":"Very fresh food. The hummus was wonderful. My husband is very picky and he waa impressed too"}
{"text":"Greek food seems to be trending these days with spots opening up all around the 
valley. Yay, because 20 years ago there was only a handful. 
Yay again because Stephano's is in the neighborhood. 

Stopped in for a light lunch and loved every bite. 
I ordered a small Baba Ganoosh and a Keba Ball.. 
The Baba Ganoosh was rich & creamy or eggplant and garlic, served with two warm pitas.. YUM.. 
The  Keba ball is kind of like cooked Kibbee.. flavorful meat on the inside with a seasoned breading on the outside and then fried..... 
So good, I ordered another one to go... 
All the items on the menu looked great and I can't wait to go back again.. If not for 
lunch.. definitely dinner!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty disappointed that this place does not belive in customer satisfaction. I ordered the lamb shank, and when it arrived it was clearly overdone i.e burnt literally. I've had lamb shank before and it looked nothing like the pictures they have on the wall.

Upon  asking they told me they used 'wine sauce' which is fine but doesn't do anything for the burnt lamb shank. When I asked for a exchange for the chicken kabobs, they told me they wouldn't refund the difference. I'm not going to be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The best Greek food I have found in Las Vegas.  Restaurant is always clean, staff is personable.  Food is consistently well prepared.  The steak shwarma fries are very good and the filet mignon kebabs incredible."}
{"text":"Had this place last night for dinner! Had the whole chicken plate and an order of dolmas. It was delicious and the customer service was a 12/10. I love the garlic sauce so I asked for extra, the cashier took great care of me and explained everything to me as it was my first time.  The price for the servings was more than fair. The chicken had a great flavor and was very moist. I will be back more often as I just moved down the street."}
{"text":"Tasty Greek food as you'd expect...  Döner was on the small side, but the lamb & beef shawarma was great!"}
{"text":"This review is a long time comin'. Stephano's is the official Endorsed Hookah Lounge of Matt C. Let me break it down for ya:

Hookah
---
Stephano's does a good hookah. Period. It's priced fairly, and usually lasts 2+ hours. Hookahmaster General Nick (a title I just invented) is an avid smoker, and takes pride in his work. He's often working on new tweaks for better smoking, and can wax poetic on things like shisha quality, etc. But, what initial got me coming back to Stephano's was the smoking quality/time/money ratio. Paymons' can make a good hookah too, but they never last over an hour. For the same money, you can smoke for hours at Stephano's, plus the refills are cheaper.

I like it, and most people I bring enjoy it also. It's not super-cheap, but I never feel like I've overpaid either. My personal favorites are the gyro pizza and the gyro bowl. It's not on the menu, but they also serve edamame, which is the perfect hookah nosh. Their beer menu is also pretty strong, and well priced.

Ambiance
---
This is something else I really like about Stephano's - it's casual atmosphere. It's a relaxed environment, and I don't feel conspicuous if I'm  sitting there alone. They have regular height tables up front, which are great if you wanna work on something while you're smoking, and a banquette'd lounge-area in the back (great for dates). Plus, even when they dim the lights in the evenings, it's still usually bright enough to read - not the case at Paymon's. If you're looking for a dark, super-romantic place though, it might not be the first choice. I will say that my FLF prefers the environ of Stephano's over all the other like establishments I've taken her. 

Service
---
Food wise, it's served at a counter, kinda fast-food-style. But if you're smoking, you get waiter service along with it. There's usually only one person doing all the serving/hookah-tending, so it occasionally gets slow, but It's a family business, so you get the plus'es and minuses of that. Nick especially is good about keeping coals tended properly. Owing to the family business thing, I was able to get the aforementioned edamame on the menu quite easily. I don't know about you, but I really like a place that caters to its customers. 

Conclusion
---
I like it here, a lot.

The 5 is comparative to local competition. I don't like giving 5's, and Stephano's isn't perfect, but it's the best I've found in Las Vegas.

There you have it.

PRO-TIP: Edamame + hookah = win
PRO-TIP: Hookah service starts at 5."}
{"text":"I found out about Stephano's when I weight lifting in late 2011. Ever since then I've been hooked! You must try their chicken kabob plate, wheat pita and with a side of galic paste, it's my absolute favorite. Everything on their menu is delicious and Stephano's also offers a great catering menu (I've gotten catering from them for family dinners and by far one of the best deals in town). I'm so happy that they have two locations; one close to my home and one close to my work."}
{"text":"First of all I love Greek food. Thai and Greek are my favorite. This place didn't disappoint me. 

I go here at least once every 10 days. Service is quick, food tastes great. Kebobs and Shawarma are my favorite. And I love their salad and Hummus."}
{"text":"Once again ... Stefano's ... food and service is awesome !!! This time we got Feta Fries and it was yummy ! Had the usual vege grilled salad and as always  !!! This place is a must !!!!"}
{"text":"Yum!  If you want a good gyro, come here!  I did have to wait probably close to 30 seconds for someone to acknowledge my existence at the register but I am willing to overlook that.  The food was so tasty and the portion size was great.  Super fresh tasting, and high quality stuff.  I am from Chicago, and have some great Greek food there, so trust me, I know what I am talking about.  :)  Food came quickly, the only thing I missed was the feta cheese all crumbled on the top.  But, for the calories I was about to consume, it didn't matter much to me."}
{"text":"Tried a combo plate with chicken and shrimp. They were a bit busy so it took awhile for the food to arrive but no biggie. Shrimp came out cold and they quickly replaced it with a nice warm one. Excellent flavors onthe shrimp and chicken and I really liked their tzatziki dip as well as the hummus dip!! Would most def recommend a visit and I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is really good! Best Greek food I've had in town in awhile. The people at the counter were really nice, helpful and patient. We liked how their menu had pictures as well as descriptions. They did bring food to our table which was nice.
I got the spinach pie plate. Came with spanikopita, two dolmas, hummus and tomotato with cucumber and onion salad. It was soooo much food but it was all really good. The seasoning on the dolmas was the best I've had in town as spiced it up, the spanikopita was nice as actual pie not those silly triangles people claim are spinach pie. The hummus was seasoned well and the salad was a nice touch. It's nice how they have wheat or white pita options as well. My friends got the gyro combo and the falafel combo and they both loved their food. They got fries and loved how they were seasoned. The falafel she hadn't had since Europe and was quite impressed. The kids all got dessert. Rice pudding they liked but the hit was the warm NUTELLA and pita! They couldn't get enough of it! Nutella in a Greek joint... Definitely a hit for kids! 
We all enjoyed and are definitely going back! 
The only reason not five stars is there were 7 of us and we had to sit separately as no table for more than four and some other tables were taken so it wouldn't have been possible to move tables together. It also therefore was crowded at the table for four once the food came."}
{"text":"I ate there for the first time today and had the beef/lamb gyro with fries.  It was wonderful, just like I remembered from back in New York.  The meat was fresh and the sauce was fresh and very good.  I enjoyed the french fries, but was too full to eat them, I'll heat them up at home and eat them. Glad I stumbled across this place.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Greek food is my favorite so this spot is a must! The food is great and super fresh. Lots of authentic items and they are great with catering to your needs and customizing what you like. All the staff is super nice. The atmosphere is great and the whole restaurant is very welcoming. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great gyros that just melt in your mouth. That statement alone should get you into Stephano's to try them out! The traditional lamb gyro was absolutely delicious, and I love that you can choose between white or wheat pita bread which is made fresh in-house. Highly recommend this dish. Also, their french fries were strangely very addicting with the perfect amount of spices. And that sauce that they serve on the side was finger-licking good. 

However, I felt that the chicken gyro pita was a little bit of a let down. The meat was super tender and so succulent and juicy, but I felt the pita sandwhich overall was a little bland and one note in flavor. 

Overall I would definitely recommend stopping in Stephano's for some great greek dishes and don't forget to check-in on yelp to claim a free dessert or side!"}
{"text":"Pretty good first impression- the chicken kabob plate was very filling and had some unique surprising flavors. It came with two generous kabob sticks and a garlic dipping sauce on the side. I was very skeptical because the garlic \"sauce\" looked more like a garlic paste and I didn't want to scare off all the vampires in the immediate las vegas area. However once I gave it a try, I couldn't stop eating it. It does have a very strong garlic punch, however it complimented the chicken perfectly. I found myself constantly going back to the dipping paste for more.
The kabobs came on a bed of \"rice pilaf\" - which was just white rice that was very fluffy, but nothing extraordinary. The Israeli salad was nice a refreshing- a good mixture of bit size pieces of cucumber and tomato. It was a nice compliment to the chicken. The place also came with a generous helping of hummus- however with all the garlic partying in my mouth, I couldn't really discern much with the hummus. They do offer wheat or white pita bread and I think I found that I don't care for the wheat bread much- just stick to the regular white pita. 
And check in on yelp! You'll earn yourself a complimentary piece of Baklava cake- just perfect. Buttery and nutty and just a perfect way to end your Greek fest!"}
{"text":"I like the food and the staff was friendly. I have to say I like the food at  Yannis better but for the proce and the variety of the menu you cant beat it!!!"}
{"text":"I Just had to come back and see if the food was still as good as last time. I was not dissapointed. We had the Mediterranean salad and the flafal both were great."}
{"text":"Great place to stop and eat
Good Hummos 
Falafel
Good student vibe
And priced right 
Next to Unlv 
Always great and fresh food 
Fart service too"}
{"text":"This location does not do Stephano's justice. When I go to the UNLV location the food is always consistent and great. This location always seems to have issues. Either something is not fresh or they don't prepare it right. I don't understand how it's possible to have so much deviation in quality and taste between two locations of the same restaurant. Whatever the issue is, they need to look at what the UNLV location is doing and replicate it."}
{"text":"The food in this place is fantastic, reminds me of the food back home in NY. It's very authentic and I can't get over how good it tastes. I recommend it to anyone in the area check this place out! Also it's not to bad on the wallet!!"}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in ages.  Absolutely delicious.  I had the protein plate with beef shawarma, gyro meat (mostly shared with my 4 yr old), and tabouli salad.  Every bite was yummy, and I have a lot leftover for later.  The free drink was a nice touch (lunchtime).  The service was calm and friendly.  Super glad we chose this place today!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. I ordered the vegetarian pita and feta cheese fries. I felt the vegetables should have been cut into thinner slices. And the feta cheese fries tasted like the fries were reheated twice. It was not fresh cooked fries. Very stale. I didn't receive my free baklava for checking in either. Dissatisfied."}
{"text":"The food is so good that they had to open a second location near Eastern and Horizon Ridge. It's a must try. I am a huge fan of the lamb and Gyro combo"}
{"text":"I love Greek food, so I always try to go when I'm in a larger city. Great beer selection as well. The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"the most flavorful  food I've had since greece!!! pork shwarma was outstanding (and unusual in  Greek food) as was all four dishes at our table: and we had some picky people .the beef shwarma was tangy, lean, and outstanding spanakopita was light and flaky filet mignon cooked to perfection. we were visiting from San Diego along with my nephew from philly, and a cousin from jersey. my favorite meal in Vegas these guys would have a line out the door if they were nearer to the strip and ran some tourist ads"}
{"text":"Terrible just absolutely terrible service. Ordered my food and it took 45 minutes to get my order. I ordered one filet mignon plate. One! The girl working at the front had no sense of urgency and I asked where my food was, she tells me to sit down and be patient, because it's coming. Are you serious? Is management going to let their employees talk to customers like that? Horrible service. Horrible employee management. The management at this location needs to change the employees. They blow!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!!! Ask for some of the special garlic sauce... If only they could ship me some to SF!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a Greek restaurant, and this place is SOOO delicious!  We're now frequent customers of this establishment, and every time I takes me awhile to decide what to order, as everything is awesome!  Portions are very good!  And they've redecorated the interior -looks beautiful"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, this place is a little hard to find at first. I had the chicken kabob and rice and my husband got some sort of gyro. We both enjoyed our food. I expected this to be more of a sit down restaurant with a menu and waiter/waitress but it was more of a Carl Jr. type of place where you go up to the counter, place your order and once its done, they call you to come get it. So, that was interesting... I'd like to come here again and try other stuff on their menu... so many things sounds good."}
{"text":"I attempted the Henderson location & received bad service. Stumbled across the Maryland Pkwy location & decided to give a try & OMG the food was amazing!!! So glad I decided to give this company a chance!! I'll be back!

Beef & Lamb Gyro- So tender & flavorful 
Fetta Cheese Fries- VERY delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place as I just recently started a Mediterranean diet & and was quickly disappointed.. Horrible customer service. Waited 30 min for a to-go order & as soon as I stepped to the counter she (Paulina D) walked away. Everyone who ordered after me got their food before me & when I asked about my food she (Paulina D) told me it's because what I ordered (Chicken Gyro & hummus). If that takes longer then your guest should be informed it will be a longer wait. No apology was even given. Just rolled her eyes & gave me a refund. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Usually the gyros here are some of the best in town but last time I ate here the shit was burnt. Made me a little sick. Gonna stay away from this location for awhile. Check out the one in Henderson."}
{"text":"Not great. Salad was good but falafel and tatizki were awful. Had to throw both away. Tasted stale and moldy. Will not ever order from them again. Disappointed. :("}
{"text":"This place is at the same plaza as Fitness 19. You can smell the aroma across the plaza so I finally decided to give it a try. The place is small with plenty of tables both indoor and outdoor. There's plenty of choices and fair prices. I ordered the a la carte items thinking it came with pita bread. Nope, it just comes with only the meat. The lady offered the fix my order and make it wrap but told her I'll come back next time. 

Food:
Beef&Lamb gyro and chicken shawarma: both were delicious by it self. The sauces made it taste even better with white rice.
Feta cheese: just fries with weird tasting \"special\" sauce that comes with it.

I'll give it another try and order the right things next time."}
{"text":"Yummy food in an out of the way location. Nice selection of vegetarian options. Their pilaf rice is the best. It is fluffy goodness and I could eat a tub of it. I love the pickled turnips. Don't forget to save room for the baklava."}
{"text":"Flavorful, decent portions and friendly staff.  Whats not to love!  The patio is awesome too...we need more patio dining options around town."}
{"text":"I gave the restaurant a second chance.  I had the chicken that was bone dry with zero flavor. Hummus was good but that was it. Won't give the place a third chance."}
{"text":"Great Greek food! Hummus was amazing and the falafel moist! Price about average will defiantly be going back"}
{"text":"Overpriced as I am sure a lot of the reviews will prove this to be true. Over 11 dollars a gyro is just too much cash. For our family of four costs dang near 50 dollars for lunch. Food is tasty and consistent I just wish there were a price change on meals and we would gladly eat there more often but with the price point being so high we eat here about 1 time a year instead of the 4 of 5 times we will visit our beloved restaurants or deli's."}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered the beef & lamb gyro on a whole wheat pita. It was delicious. One of the better ones I've had. I love that they offer the wheat pita. I will definitely be back to try there other menu options."}
{"text":"My fave Mediterranean go to in Vegas. Of all the times I have been I have never had a bad experience. I have brought many friends and family and they have all fallen in love with the place too. One of my favorite things about Stephano's is that whether you are Vegan or crave meat, there is something for everyone...including my two year old. The atmosphere is very relaxed they have a great selection of beer and alcohol and it's in a great location.

Some of my favorites that I order are the lo-carb plate with gyro meat (gyro meat, lettuce, tomatoes tzatziki) and the gyro sandwich combo. Make sure you Yelp when you get there, try their yummy baklava (one of the best!!!)"}
{"text":"It's solid for fast food Greek, 4 stars or more are places like The Great Greek or Miraki and this isn't even close to those spots. This is a solid fast food option"}
{"text":"Stephano's is great! My boyfriend and I ordered take-out lunch from here today and loved it! We had a coupon - buy 2 gyros, get 1 free, which we didn't really need... but why not!? So.. we ordered two cheese gyros (gyro, feta cheese, tomatoes, onions, tzaziki sauce) and one beef & lamb gyro (gyro, tomatoes, lots of onions, tzaziki sauce). They were all stuffed with fresh ingredients and had amazing flavor with the tzaziki sauce. The portions were generous, the prices were good, and our order was ready in about 10 minutes. We will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"My favorite mediterranean place! I always get the chicken kebab and it's always juicy and tender. Sometimes the wait is a little long but definitely worth it. I've tried other greek places and this is my #1 spot!"}
{"text":"Geeked for Greek!

Five stars? Yeah, I'm just as surprised as you. The food is an easy four stars and the helpful service pushed it into the five star realm. Ordering takeout can be hit or miss, I mean who doesn't like their food fresh and hot. Stephano's was a definite hit with piping hot meats for my mouth. 

I ordered the Beef and Lamb Gyro meal. This came with sliced gyro, onions, tzatziki sauce, hummus, Israeli salad, and a carb fueled mountain of pita bread. The Gyro meat was juicy and cut thick which is a nice change from normal gyro cuts. The menu says it comes with two pieces of pita bread, but they gave me at least five pieces of soft pillow love. 

The pita bread was soft, but durable and made for the perfect meat holding pocket. What's a pita pocket without all the fixn's? That's where the Israeli salad and hummus come into play. The hummus was creamy and worked as great edible seal to hold in the fresh Israeli salad. 

This type of salad isn't the leafy green type you're thinking about, this salad is made of tomatoes, parsley, onions, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, and salt. Which is almost like Greek salsa and it's delish! You can tell theirs is made daily because the veggies still have that crunch - Five star fast Greek food all the way!

PRO TIP: Free Baklava with check-in!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Steak Shawerma. Food was excellent.  Service was also great! Dessert next! Free Baklava with my check in."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Stephano's. This was a very unexpected and pleasant experience. Our group had the Beef & Lamb Gyro Plate and a single Gyro. The plate serving was very generous and everyone commented on how tasty the food was and the pita was just right.

The service was excellent, Rob was very helpful, described the plates and helped to make our selections. Although quite small the shop was agreeable, clean and neat. We were too full to have desert, but took a tray of Baklava home for later. Needless to say the baklava was excellent. This will become as regular stop for us."}
{"text":"This is mine and my family's go-to Greek restaurant. Their fries is a must everytime we come here. Love their different sauces that other greek restaurants seem to not have. Especially their garlic sauce and pickled turnips. My 5-year old niece loves their kids meal and enjoys coming here. Baklava size is just right for me. On my recent visit, my husband ordered creme brûlée for dessert and it was divine!"}
{"text":"Easy access in the Smith's shopping center near Starbucks.

Good flavors and the portions are filling.  
My mom and I ended up taking half of our dinners home for lunch the next day.
So... it was like getting 2 meals in 1.  Always a nice thing.

Service was \"mixed\". The cashier was nice and friendly and walked us through his favorites when we asked.
But the kitchen seemed to have issues... we waited a really long time for our dinner.  A couple people who ordered after us were done with their dinners and left before we even received ours.
The cashier gave us free baklava in exchange for having to wait.  So, we had dessert before dinner.

The baklava was not overly sweet but the phyllo dough was really thick and a bit dry. So, it wasn't my favorite but being free... I ate it.
The beef/lamb gyro was juicy and tasty.
The veggie kabob I ordered had a nice flavorful grill on it and the veggies were fresh and not overcooked... not undercooked... cooked just right.

I'll be back to try more of the menu.
But I'll try to go at a less busy time of the day."}
{"text":"One of the best Greek food restaurants in town. Has all the favorites including Pastitsio and  Mousaka"}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST Greek restaurant in Vegas. The people do not lie. This place stays busy, and consistently delivers top notch, quality prepared food at a reasonable rate. You get a good amount and will have leftovers. Bring an appetite and prepare to see what all the hype is about. 

My advice: get a Shawerma plate. I like the Chicken Shawerma with a side of rice, hummus and the Israeli salad. I always order extra Tzatziki sauce as it's delicious and always fresh. I also recommend the 1/2 chicken plate, gyro plate, kabob's etc. They have delicious large Greek salads for the vegetarians out there. The Baklava is AMAZING! Makes for a great dessert and I suggest you splurge and try it. Really never had a bad meal here. It always hits the spot. 

I usually eat here 1-2 times a week. Been eating here for years. Used to order it daily at my office when I worked near their UNLV location. Have not gotten sick of it yet. Don't expect that I will. They are good people and know me personally by this point. They take great care of their guests and feed us well. 

It's without hesitation that I recommend Stefano's to anyone looking for a delicious meal. You can thank me later, after you get out of your food coma."}
{"text":"Fast service & tasty hummus"}
{"text":"If you want Greek food, I suggest checking this place out.  Forget about Opa, or that drive thru Greek crap in town.  This place has it all and does it right.  I'm not a true fan of Greek fare, but when I am in the mood for it, this place is the stop I'll make.

First, it's easy to order, well priced, and they have a lot of dishes you wouldn't normally see at the other Mediterranean places.What they do have that others serve is done well.  Their pita is soft and chewy, the meats are well seasoned and delish, and their sauces (yogurt, hummus, etc.) taste fresh and served in generous portions.  The gyro I ordered could honestly feed two people or one hungry big guy.  I'm a big girl myself and I couldn't eat the entire thing.  They keep their gyro's simple, too--onion, cucumber and the sauce.  Done.  I love that.

Want to Greek out?  Head here for some nummies and bring an empty stomach.  They do take out, too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Super delicious food, great serving sizes, prices and true to the Greek and Mediterranean style. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Totally loved this place...had the Filet Mignon Steak Kebab and the steak was cooked perfectly, the rice was tender, the hummus was silky smooth, the Israeli salad was fresh and not over seasoned (I don't even like raw onions but in this salad it was amazing), and the pita bread was nice and warm...can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch at 12:25 and there was no line, except the entire staff was busy. One person was taking her time packing to go food, and person was doing walking around the kitchen doing something that I can't remember but, the phone continually rang and eventually she picked it up despite the growing line almost out the door. We were done ordering after almost 5 minutes of waiting. No acknowledgement or anything.

Our lunch break is one hour and it took 5 minutes to order and 20 minutes to get our gyro wrap (comes with free drink) & small feta fries. We were given number 43, but yet when it was done number 45 was called out so we had to ask them to make sure it was mistake. 

Gyro wrap was salty, it comes with beef and lamb but I couldn't tell if there was any beef in there. The meat tastes the same to me throughout the entire wrap. Definitely finish your feta fries in the restaurant. It doesn't taste good after a few hours.

Prices here are a bit higher than say parsley modern, which charges about 7-8 for a wrap and 9-10 for a plate. However they don't offer free drinks with wraps or plates like stephanos. If I were to come back, I would probably call in an order. Make sure you call extremely early because itll take a while for them to pick up."}
{"text":"Food is good, portions are big  (if you get a plate) if you get a sandwich they don't come with sides.   I forget when I order a plate I can share with someone, there's that much food.  The dessert taste homemade.  Staff is super friendly"}
{"text":"Used to be great when it first opened but they fell off. Ordered a combo plate today and was disappointed. Rice was soggy, beef shawarma was super salty, chicken kabob was burnt, Israeli salad was so old and sour it was basically pickled, and the hummus had a giant pool of oil on it and tasted old. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The best gyro in town.  Tried the feta and olives appetizer...very tasty, HUGE portions of delicious food."}
{"text":"The beef was fair and over seasoned and dry.
The pita is mediocre not tasty or fresh too doughy.
Service was friendly. The chicken greek salad was decent  with so many other choices I probably would not go back"}
{"text":"Food is 4.5 stars, service is a whole other animal...needs work...not obliged to return at this time."}
{"text":"So I'm sure that this is not the greatest Greek place on earth BUT it's pretty damn good.

Came here for the 1st time today for lunch ... My party ordered the following:

Spinach Pie Appetizer - it was a decent size and priced fairly at $3.99.  It was one of the better spinach pies that I've had in Vegas.

Chicken Shawarma Gyro - I believe this was priced at $6.75 and I believe for $2.50 more you can get a side and a drink.  I can't vouch for the taste as I did not have any but my counterpart said it was great and it smelled amazing.

Grilled Nutella Pita:  $3.95 - I would have paid $6.00 for this.  Need I say more?  How can anything with Nutella be bad?

Free baklava - with a Yelp check-in.  This too was great - and I'd definitely order it the next time.

I should also mention the place was very clean and the guy behind the counter was HOT!"}
{"text":"Pleasant staff, very clean dining room. The food was excellent. I had a falafel greek salad with pomegranate dressing, also had a gyro wrap. Enjoyed both. Also there are pickled turnips and jalapeno avaiable near the knives and forks which you should also try. Both very good."}
{"text":"I've only just started to have my food heart shift toward Mediterranean food, gyros specifically. I can say with much confidence that this place has the best gyros I have ever had thus far in my journey! ( Just order them with lettuce and Feta ) I wish this place was in my backyard!"}
{"text":"Food is AWESOME! My family and I love the Greek food we get in Detroit's Greektown, and we compare all other Greek foods to it. My parents ordered beef and lamb gyros, my brother got the lamb shank, and I had the spinach pie. We all shared the stuffed grape leaves as an appetizer. EVERYTHING was delicious. My dad and brother said the meat was the best they've had. Price was great for the amount of food. We could've shared two or fewer platters between the four of us. Staff were prompt and friendly!"}
{"text":"I can remember the exact moment that I fell in love. I was sitting at a corner table in a - new to me - eatery. My constant companion ordered a gyro and I ordered the chicken kebab plate. My plate came with 2 skewers of chicken, rice, hummus, salad and your choice of white or wheat pita... AND a small cup of garlic sauce. I don't know what they put in that cup besides the obvious garlic, but I have thought about it almost daily since that first taste... when I fell in love. I have thought about the different items I could put it on: steak, pork, fish, eggs, bread - the list could be endless. 
The chicken was delicious even without the sauce. I enjoyed the wheat pita and the salad was very tasty too. The rice and hummus were good, I think the plate was too much for an average appetite. I think it would be the perfect sharing size for an elderly couple.
The service was outstanding. The lady at the counter was very helpful in answering our questions and she is generous with her genuine smiles. This cozy eatery is one of my new favorites and I try to think of reasons to go to that part of town just to partake of that delicious chicken kebab plate with the amazing garlic sauce.
Coke Zero is served here also.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came to Stephano's wanting to fulfill a gyro craving, which was satisfied! Located right across the university, this Greek/Mediterranean spot is delicious. I ordered the Beef & Lamb Gyro & made it a meal with fries, which came with a complimentary fountain drink because I was a student. It was around lunch time when I went & it wasn't too busy, but people started arriving shortly after. 

I had heard of the place & it had always came up on my yelp when I looked for gyros, hummus or shawarmas so decided to check it out. 

The fellow that took my order was friendly & so was the one who gave me my order. 

The menu had a variety of items to choose from, from baba ganoush to all types of hummus & Mediterranean dishes & as much as I wanted to try all of them I just wanted a gyro. They had lunch specials as well at good prices. 

My gyro was delicious & the meat was juicy & tender. I am not a big fan of lamb, but most gyros are mixed with beef & lamb so it was pretty good. I love fries & fry sauces & Stephano's serves their fries with a killer fry sauce that's tangy & compliments their seasoned fries well. 

All in all I would return because to try their falafel sandwich."}
{"text":"The best Greek food in Vegas! We couldn't imagine eating any where else when we are craving Greek!"}
{"text":"I continue to introduce friends & family to the best place in town! Togo or sit down still top notch! Love this place and their staff! The boys are great too! (Rob & Nick) thanks for being so damn good"}
{"text":"Cheese gyro was on point!  Feta fries were hitting. And grilled tomato was just okay. But this is a really good Greek restaurant as the meat is super tender. Service takes way too long, though."}
{"text":"I had my wedding rehearsal dinner catered from Stephano's. Delivery was on time, the pricing was absolutely fair, and my guests LOVED the meal. Thanks so much!! I will be ordering catering from you again."}
{"text":"I have nothing negative to say about  this place it's absolutely fantastic. I have been to this location a few times and have never had any problems service is great the staff is wonderful there always very friendly and helpful the Gyro's are absolutely fantastic. Definitely a place you should stop in and check out its a spot I definitely will continue to go back to over and over again."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. Great service, great food, good price. No idea how they get chicken to taste that good."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant a lot! I ordered the spinach pie appetizer which was delicious, and the veggie kabobs. My boyfriend ordered the gyro plate which he also liked. The portions are good as well. It's a little on the pricey side, but I will still be back"}
{"text":"Tri tip shawerma was very tasty, hummus was good, and the free baklava for check in was superb! 
The Israeli salad had too much onion and not enough cucumber for my taste. Boyfriend says the tabbouleh needed more couscous."}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Give Me Some... Some tasty Mediterranean/Greek food for my belly! Listen! Procrastination for trying out new places in your neighborhood is terrible! I could kick myself for not coming here to eat so much sooner! Better late than never right? You see this has been bookmarked for well... let's just say a very long time. I decided that this past weekend was going to be the time I gave in and just tried them out. The great thing about Stephano's is that they are located super close to home! This could actually also be a bad thing but for now let's stick with the good!

Upon arriving I must've picked a great night to come because they weren't busy at all! That's a score especially when you are hungry! I walked in and BAM you are immediately faced with a huge menu! I knew I was going to be doing a take out order so I wanted to make sure I had exactly what I wanted mapped out before making my way to the counter. The ambiance of the place is pretty chill and I could really appreciate the décor and just overall vibe of the place. Thanks to my fellow Yelper's for posting those tasty looking pictures I was already fixed on the Loaded Beef and Lamb Gyro Fries! My mom needed to order as well so her choice was the Beef and Lamb Gyro Pita. Based off the reviews I knew that I couldn't go wrong with either of these two selections AND it helped that the cashier endorsed these two items as well! 

Total wait time for my food to actually be ready was under 15 minutes so another kudos for them for being fast and efficient! I will be visiting on the regular now, not only because the food is great but the service was pretty good as well. There are seriously several other items on the menu that I am keeping my taste buds open to. It's nothing like have a local restaurant in the area that can execute all of these things. Sincerely a happy and full customer :-)"}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas for a trade show this past week and found this place via Yelp. Ordered lunch using  postmates and was blown away at how delicious their food was!!! My coworker ordered the chicken kebab plate and I the beef lamb gyro plate. Both were amazing! Their yogurt was so good! And their Israeli salad even better! The food was so amazing we ordered Stephano's two days in a row!"}
{"text":"First off there are very few restaurants near UNLV that are adequate for lunch and Stephano's is one of the few. 

Today, I ordered the gyros plate. It comes with hummus, a tomato salad, and one extra pita bread. The gyros is something special, the meat is charred which is very different from the one dimensional gyros that I have had at many Greek establishments. 

I left completely satisfied and will continue to come here for the comfortable atmosphere, solid food, and friendly employees."}
{"text":"I first tried Stephano's on Maryland Parkway and have since been a fan. Yesterday, I was by their new location and decided to stop in.

When I walked in, there were two ladies ahead of me and they took forever. They were unable to make up their  minds and the girl behind the register was having trouble putting in the order. 

After placing my order, the girl asked me again what rice I had ordered and when she handed me the water cups she stuck her fingers on the inside of the cup. I could tell she had not been trained on common sanitary procedures. Also everything about her and the process of placing my order was extremely slow.

As soon as the tray was put down on the table I saw that the side of pita was burnt. Also, the pita containing the gyros meat was drenched in grease. The gyros meat was tasty as usual and both sides were good enough. However, I am not a huge fan of their hummus because it is has zero flavor. The baklava's phyllo dough was also dry. 

Stephano's is a great Greek fast casual alternative to Daphne's Greek Cafe that serves artificially tasting Greek food. The food also comes relatively quickly no matter how busy they are and the food is consistent."}
{"text":"For those of you that read my reviews you'll notice I don't really ramble on about too much I only write reviews about places that are really good or really bad .i do  check in  everywhere I go.. The reason I'm writing this review just because this place stands out as absolutely awesome. I've been all over the world including the Middle East and their salads tastes exactly like my wife's mother salad who was born and raised in Cairo. The chicken shwarma is absolutely the best I've had in Vegas it's fresh soft and crunchy it's truly the best chicken shawerma I've had. The gyro was great. the bread is fresh and soft it's basically 5 out of 5 stars . You get great service ,very nice people ,good price , and fantastic  food. if you're looking for a a gyro,  or sawarma or Middle Eastern stuff this place is clean and delicious. Extensive menu  grilled meat,  sides. This place ROCKS! !!!"}
{"text":"Stephano's has the best french fries I've ever had. I usually pair it with a chicken gyro but switch out the sauce for their secret fry sauce. Super close to UNLV!"}
{"text":"So I have to admit...sometimes I feel a little cheated that I am not of Greek ancestry. I mean come on, this is one area of the world that has some of the best food one could ever taste and yes I could quite possibly have it everyday for the rest of my life. Yep, even carnivores and vegetarians could even sit together, eat and feel like gluttons after having this type of cuisine.  For me...I love it all....meat, veggies and even the Satan-contaminated carbs....bring it on!! 

I recently discovered this gem after a classmate of mine and I needed to refuel for the long day ahead. He suggested this place because it was across from campus and since I crave Greek/Mediterranean about once a week...I didn't mind trying a place I had yet to experience.  When we arrived I decided to order the combo plate ( chicken, beef and lamb gyro served with onion and a side of Israeli salad, hummus, pita bread and a garlic sauce I could drink by the pitcher) and because I am not ashamed to stuff my face and call it healthy at the same time I had the Greek Salad as well. Good God....the Greek gods were singing praises when I had took my first bite!! The meat was fresh and well portioned. The hummus was smooth and creamy and the salad was abundant with veggies and feta cheese just like Zeus would have liked it. Prices were decent which I loved yet the only thing I would complain about is the Spinach Pie...a little too dry and bland for my taste and the Falafel lacked a little flavor. But after I found out that they served Ouzo and that they do deliver I felt better (but what doesn't feel better after Ouzo!) Overall, my experience here was great....I can't wait to try the other items they have to offer. I will be back soon because I think I have just been hit by the \"let the addiction begin\" bat by Aphrodite."}
{"text":"Excellent Mediterranean food! Just like being in Greece! I ordered the Hummus, feta fries and chicken gyro wrap. The flavors are amazing. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Went to Stephano's for lunch with coworkers today. Several people ahead of us but the line moved quickly. Each of us ordered separately. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because mine took much longer than theirs and I had to go up to ask about it, versus them letting me know it may take a little longer. 
Otherwise service was good, friendly staff and I felt like they appreciated my business. Food was great! I asked for low carb kebab combo (chicken & rib eye) which was not on the menu, but they gladly said okay. Israeli Salad was refreshing and tasty. Coworkers enjoyed their Gyros and fries. Good portion sizes too.
Best of all, we learned they deliver! We are a few miles away on Howard Hughes Pkwy - where there aren't a lot of options for delivery. This is great news! ($3 dlvy charge w/$15 minimum)"}
{"text":"We were excited to see that a highly rated Greek restaurant was located not far from us.  I had it bookmarked for some time so when the craving for Greek food kicked in it was time to check off that bookmark.  We ordered the Beef and Lamb Gyro Plate with extra meat.  We also got the loaded Gyro fries and an order of Moussaka.   We added a few of the Baklava to our order include our free one for checking in - sweet!  We got our food to go.  The wait was not too long and they offered us water while we waited - very nice.
   They have an average size dinning room which is nothing fancy but this is a fast casual place so that was to be expected. The service was great and the young lady who took our order was awesome.  Her enthusiasm and great attitude was something you don't see too often so I was impressed.
   The food was tasty with the gyro meat being the true standout.  It was moist and delicious.  You can tell that had just cut it off the spit and not reheated it which some places do.  Although we had ordered extra meat it didn't look like extra so if the normal amount is much smaller then extra is the way to go.  The Moussaka was OK.  It came in a small aluminum container and had been burnt on the edges.  We also got the loaded gyro fries which had lots of gyro meat, hummus, spices and Tabbouleh, tomatoes and red onions.  They were very good and truly lived up to the loaded name.  
   The gyro plates came with hummus, Israeli salad and pita bread.  The hummus was very good and plentiful.  The Israeli Salad (cucumbers, onions and tomatoes in vinegar) was OK but I would prefer a Greek salad instead.  We got the wheat pita bread which was slightly sweet tasting  and delicious.  The tzatziki sauce was very good and made a great addition to the gyro meat.  The Secret Fry Sauce had a mustard taste and seemed out of place with the cuisine.  
   To top off the meal was the tasty Baklava.  They had the right amount of honey to make them perfectly moist.  I had to ensure I got my fair share of the Baklava and it was worth it.  Definitely get the Baklava when you eat at Stephanos.  A good place to fill you craving for tasty Greek food."}
{"text":"Chicken Kabob plate is great.  Big portions that two adults could split.  Great location with easy parking.  Super nice staff and food comes out right away.  Only knock is I wish they did homemade pitas."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Reasonable prices and they even deliver! Highly recommend this place. Humus is amazing here too"}
{"text":"Yumminess  
needs salt   
Baba ganoosh ok 
salad could use a few more morsels of meat"}
{"text":"When I was a Mediterranean newbie, I used to come here all the time. Alas, more experienced, more discerning. I ordered the steak and chicken kabobs. Once I was able to get the meat off the skewers without a hacksaw, I found the chicken tasty, but somewhat dry. The steak was a bit stringy for my taste. Both were cooked almost to the point of cremation. The accompanying rice was pasty, not fluffy, and the cucumber and tomato salad was so vinegary, it made my taste buds ache. There was hummus on the side which I guess was good, but I'm not really a big fan of hummus. And even though the tzatsiki sauce was pretty good, I'm not sure it will lure me back!"}
{"text":"I've been to the many Stephano's around town and by far Stephano's is the bar I set all Greek/Mediterranean food up to. The prices are reasonable and the food is really good. This Stephano's is my favorite. The manager is Stephano's nephew I believe and he used to run the one across the street from UNLV. He knows how to run a business he is friendly and the quality of food is great, the portion sizes are perfect! When he left UNLV you could tell the quality and portion sizes when down a notch, I did't put two and two together until we came here for lunch and he was running the biz. Parking is a little tight and they have outside seating and from the looks of it the outdoors is dog friendly. Just remember that if you bring your dog there are health code rules, and be courteous to other patrons sitting outside."}
{"text":"We come here once a week and get a variety of food. The atmosphere is nice and the place always seems really clean. I have gotten the chicken and the gyro's. The Israeli salad is really good. I'm not a big hummus fan but they always allow me to substitute a salad or their fries. Not expecting good fries from a Greek place but surprisingly so, their fries are awesome!!.
Food='s good
Service='s Friendly
Establishment='s Clean
Price='s $5-15 per person"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!  Tender kebobs with delicious seasonings (the filet was perfect!). Humus was creamy and tasty and then...  The baklava!  It's worth the trip just for that!!!  Best ever!"}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved Stephano's.  Authentic mediterranean food.  So many choices to choose from.  The chicken shawerma and the gyros are to die for.  The fries are awesome. Food comes out quick, fresh, and full of flavor.  I'm in Vegas a few times a year and I always stop by. Service is awesome."}
{"text":"There's 2 customers in the restaurant.  There's 6 workers.  It's been over 15 minutes to get a chicken rice bowl out, and it's still not out.  All I hear is f bombs from the cool employees, that think it's okay to curse and have a disgraceful conversation in front of customers."}
{"text":"This place is really good there Service is excellent. Their food is to die for lots of good flavors. Restaurant gives you a nice and calm vibe so check this place out."}
{"text":"I ordered for the first time today from their new location down the road on Ft Apache. I placed the order online at about 4pm on a Sunday. I did call ahead to see if their Dolma (grape leaves) were hot or cold/ meat or not. They are cold with rice and tomato paste. I decided to pass. I placed my order online which was very easy, no need to create an account, all the selections were simple and you can customize your order. We ordered a combo plate and a shwerma plate. The food arrived at 4:25pm even though the order confirmation said it would take much longer. That was nice. The delivery person was very friendly and kind. The food was AMAZING and arrived in nice plastic plates with clear covers. The french fries were those perfectly lightly battered kind. So flavorful. Krispy on the outside. They came with a special dipping sauce which is a light orange cream color and tasted kind of honey mustard-y. VERY good. My husband is a bit picky so it means a lot when he says \"This place is my new favorite. Not a single thing was less than perfect.\" The israeli salad was flavorful, fresh and just a tiny spicy. Not boring at all. The Taziki sauce is rich and cool. Pita bread is hot, fresh, soft and abuntant. Two big breads per order. We got regular and whole wheat. The hummus was perfect. The meats were just as we hoped they would be. Perfectly flavored and visually appealing. It was a food ordering dream come true. I can usually put food away but I couldn't finish my whole plate and I had them hold the rice. I am so glad this place opened. I certainly recommend this place to anyone who is hungry."}
{"text":"My husband and I order here at least 1x a week. Our favorite is the whole chicken meal. Big portions for what you pay! The chicken is always cooked perfectly and has just enough garlic. The rice is SOOOOO good. We also recommend their fries and don't forget their fry sauce! That stuff is so good we even dip our chicken in it. Hummus is pretty good too. The only thing I wish they had was fresh pita. Other than that this place is amazing. Their filet kabob and their Greek salad is good! I recommend the house dressing. Overall we love this place and will continue to order here! They never disappoint."}
{"text":"I totally love Stephano's, this was my first time. I ordered the tri tip steak pita with a side of hummus.  It was so delicious, the meat tender, juicy and tasty.  The hummus was just right and they give you a very generous portion of food.  The prices are extremely reasonable, I have found my new lunch hang out."}
{"text":"Very close to my house so I thought I'd give this place a go yesterday. Dining area is big and nice. Ordered the low carb combo plate: chicken and gyro. Chicken was moist and well flavored. Gyro was hands down the best I've ever had. Greek salad was crunching and the pickled jalapeños were very good. Service was friendly and nice. Will return here again."}
{"text":"Well ever wondered what 50 bucks in Greek food looks like? Here you can find out if two people order the double protein and iced teas. Well tech it was 46 but wow sooo over priced. The Israeli salad is pretty lazy, just cubed veggies in dressing. Would be much more palatable if it was sliced , just to give the impression it's not gruel. The meat options chicken swarms and gyro was average with tons of salt. But 46 bucks??? Service was pretty slow took 18 minutes to get these out to us with 3 other people sitting in the resturant. The great greek is definitely worth the drive to save on cash and get alot more return on taste and service."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times.  The food never disappoints!  The service is usually better than it was today, however.  Today they seemed to be understaffed.  The girl who was the cashier was also delivering food to tables and taking to go orders over the phone so when she was running orders to the tables we had to wait a bit to be helped and a bit of a line developed.  

I've only had chicken when I've been here.  More specifically, the Chicken Kabob plate.  It comes with pita, your choice of wheat or white, Israeli salad, hummus, and rice with 2 kabobs of chicken that is SO flavorful and delish!  

If you like garlic you HAVE TO get the garlic sauce with your meal.  It has a similar consistency to butter but it is AMAZING.  

Also, with your check in you get a free baklava.  

Today they had a special where with any entree, appetizer, or plate you get a free drink. 

The food is still top notch and if you have a love of Mediterranean food this is definitely a go to!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food. We've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. The gyros salad with pomegranate balsamic is wonderful, and huge. It comes with 2 pitas. Easily makes 2 meals. The gyros sandwiches and chicken kebabs are also excellent. They do prepare the food to order, so be prepared to wait a bit."}
{"text":"Awesome gyros and the fries are bomb! I love that they deliver. They have a cool modern vibe. They know my order when I call and the place is at a great price point. I like the veggie wrap and the regular gyro. My friend hated the chicken skewers."}
{"text":"The food here is the BOMB!!! Never in my life have I had such GOOD lamb and beef!!! 

They are a little on the pricier side but you get a LOT of food for the price so it isn't bad. My roommate and I usually split one of the plates (about $16) for dinner and it's just the right amount of food!

The staff is friendly and the restaurant/bathrooms are super clean. 



The hummus is awesome! I always do a combo plate with the lamb and beef and OH MAN it never disappoints. So delicious!! Always fresh.

I try to eat here at least once a week. Great place."}
{"text":"I love this place! My favorite meal is the chicken kabob bowl. The chicken is always cooked perfectly and the rice and salad just taste great together. Of note I have ordered this meal  many times in the past month amd every time it is cooked to perfection, consistent with the correct food, always tastes fresh and they never forgot anything in my order. The employees are always very pleasant when I order via the phone and my order is always ready when I come into the store to pick it up. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Filet mignon kabob is amazing! Just melts in your mouth! The french fries are phenomenal so fresh and tasty, make sure to get the special fry sauce! Definitely going to be a regular here!!"}
{"text":"Could seriously eat here everyday.. The food is yummy and the family is great that owns it."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Every time I'm in Vegas I make sure to visit them. The food is just like home made. Very clean and well organized. Their rice pudding is to die for!!"}
{"text":"This location is just as good as there others been a long time fan! The Chicken Kebab plate and Kofta plate are some of my favorites!!"}
{"text":"Love the food at this place the biggest downfall is how long it actually takes normal wait time is at least 30 min eating in or take out"}
{"text":"This replaced khourys.   They did a great job decorating the place.   I ordered the filet mug on kebabs which were good not great.   All in all good place and will return"}
{"text":"Omgosh! My prayers have been answered! This is the best Greek Mediterranean food in Vegas ! Just ordered through postmates thought I'd give this place a try I order the beef  shawerma plate and the 1/2 chicken plate and a bite sized baklava. Never had baklava so that's why I tried the bite size piece . Everything was seasoned perfectly and Delicious  and boy let me tell you the baklava is awesome I'm ordering again this Friday and ordering a dozen baklava having then each morning with my morning tea and they same plates for work and dinner later. Thank you . So happy I'm doing my happy food dance"}
{"text":"I came by the other day because a classmate suggested that I come check this place out. I ordered the chicken shawarma greek salad and the chicken shawarma loaded fries. I am going to compare Stephano's to Great Greek because it has set the bar for me. 

I feel like the chicken shawarma greek salad was good, but didn't quite measure up to the salads at the Great Greek. The great greek's salad is loaded with feta cheese, olives, tomatoes, etc. Stephano's also put them in their salad, but it seems a bit lacking in comparison. In addition, the fries here aren't quite as amazing as the feta fries at the Great Greek. The pita bread here are also a bit smaller and stiffer. Meat quality seems to be pretty good and I have no complaints there. Overall, I feel like Great Greek has more flavor in their dish than Stephano's. I honestly can't place my finger on what it is, but it is just a tad bit better. 

In my book, Stephano's is a close second to Great Greek. I will always opt to go to the Great Greek over this spot, but if I happen to be in the area or if Great Greek is closed for the day, I would be more than happy to come here. I highly suggest that you try both places and then make your own judgement call."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Best Mediterranean meal I've ever had. I ordered kebab ,and my husband ordered chicken and kebab. We loved it . Good service . Wonderful taste of the food . Totally recommend !"}
{"text":"Food is quick and pretty tasty. Feta fries were good, not great. We need to improve the gyro meat as well. Other than that everything was very solid"}
{"text":"This place looks like you would have waiter service but there isn't. Ordering is done at a front counter and a buzzer/timer is given to you. After sitting down a few minutes then buzzer goes off and the food was at the pick up window. 

PROS:  Gyros
              Feta Fries
              Israeli salad 
              Sauce for fries
              

CONS:  Hummus (needed more seasoning or something)

I would go back again for a gyro.  Next time I will order regular fries instead of the feta, the cheese didn't stick to the fries so it was hard to eat at the same time."}
{"text":"My go to place for a delicious and healthy meal.  Tonight I ordered the chicken kabob plate with a yummy salad, hummus wheat pita and rice.  Prices are reasonable and the quality is excellent. While you order at the counter the staff is friendly and prompt.  Food is delivered to the table hot and with a smile. Portions are good and I usually have extra to take home.  Happy that they are only blocks from my home!"}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp kebab. It was very seasoned. Not in a good way but the rice was very good as was the hummus. Delicious baklava.  Good service."}
{"text":"Delicious! Definitely need to try everything on the menu and they have a killer fry sauce and garlic sauce!

Lots of vegetarian options for us non-carnivores and there's even outdoor seating!

The previous restaurant that was in this location had bad service...these guys know what they're doing!"}
{"text":"\"Crazy Pita\" has been my spot for my Mediterranean fix, this place is so-so. I placed a order to-go and I waited like 20minutes plus with my girlfriend in the car.

They just apologized and I ended up not enjoying it. I was really hungry and ate it all but it's honestly not as good as \"Crazy Pita\". I prefer the hummus there, and this one just didn't hit the spot for me personally.

The one stand out is the baklava (maybe I'm spelling it wrong) but it was out of this world delicious.

Other than that I'm not going to say it's terrible but I will stick to my \"Crazy\""}
{"text":"Stephanos's has been a staple of the UNLV dining scene for years. Located right across the street, from the Student Union, Stephano's offers some great and authentic Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food for students craving more than just generic burgers and sandwiches.

Stephano's is a great place to be adventurous in your selections if you are familiar with Mediterranean dishes, but if your new to the scene, you can't go wrong with the Beef & Lamb Gyros, or the Garlic Chicken sandwich. However, a MUST try are the fries and the baklava. I don't know what they do, but have some of the best fries in the city. Super crispy along with a tasty fry sauce make it a must-have when stop by here. The baklava is incredibly flakey with subtle hints of honey and nuts.

The restaurant itself is pretty standard. Coming in you see a variety of chairs and tables, and you walk up to the front counter where you place an order. It's a cross of a restaurant (the food is usually brought to you and it takes a while to make it fresh) and fast food (you order off a menu board, pay right away, and get your own drinks), Tucked away in the corner is a lounge/couch area where they used to serve hookah and drink. They got rid of hookah, but the area is still open to those who wish to lounge around.

I consider the prices to be a big high for the UNLV/Student budget. At about $10 for a combo meal, its definitely approaching sit-down restaurant food prices. But I think its definitely worth at-least a try, especially if you are looking for real Mediterranean fare."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Perfect patio dining, great food and good prices. Can't wait to walk down again soon!"}
{"text":"Best Gyro I've had ever!! Good prices and clean environment and friendly staff. The Baklava is a desert pastry. Give this place a try, you will love it."}
{"text":"Stopped today for my annual meal while in Las Vegas. I really like the flavoring of their Gyro meat and the pita bread is super fresh. If I lived here I'd use them for catering as I've seen their product and it presents very well. Good place, great food and right across from UNLV. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I must say this place was
Delicious. I didn't have the pleasure to go myself as my husband picked up an order. I can't really say if the service was good as we did not dine in. 

I can say that the food was excellent. I ordered the chicken bowl. Sounds simple but great flavors. 

Husband order a pita (lamb) and it was so tender and delicious. 

Definitely looking forward to trying other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Good Gyro, hummus with pita and great baklava.  My girlfriend got the chicken which was great too.  I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Great service, great food = BOMB.COM!!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place. I found a delivery menu on my door a few weeks ago and decided to try them out, and now I can't stop. This is the BEST Mediterranean food I've ever had. I get the filet mignon kabobs, and they are cooked perfectly every single time (medium rare inside).  I've also tried shrimp and chicken, they're amazing too. The amount of food lasts me two servings, they definitely don't skimp. The wheat pita bread is really good, and so is the israeli salad. They have an orange-ish fry sauce that I like to dip everything in. They offer a low-carb option for their meals, which is double meat and no rice. That's 4 huge kabobs!

Overall, the food is fantastic, but so is their service. They always tell me delivery will be 45 minutes to an hour, I always have my food in half an hour. It arrives hot and the delivery guy is really nice. They earn every one of their 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Greta tasting food, from the lamb gyros to a whole chicken with pita bread (wheat or white) for only around 10 dollars. You can also get a free soda with a UNLV ID. The place is usually busy during lunch time, full of students and staff alike."}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars. 

Overall I thought it was pretty good. The restaurant and setup reminded me more of fast food than a sit down experience as expected. You order up front and get a number. 

The food costs over $10 which is very expensive for this type of meal. The portion size is fine for 1 person and most plates come with hummus, puta, israeli salad, rice, and then meat of choice. 

I tried falafel and chicken and both stood up to fast food cuisine of this type but it didn't really blow me away in any aspect of the meal.  Worth a try but I think there's better alternatives for Greek food in town."}
{"text":"This is my first visit here and I would have to say I'm impressed.

It's very clean and somewhat quiet inside. The decor is cute, woodsy, but clean.

I ordered the cheese beef gyro meal and it was really good, which is rare cause Greek seems to be hit or miss for me. The meal comes with fries and some really good sauce with a drink. I loved it all. I don't really have anything bad to say. I'm glad I found a Greek place close to home."}
{"text":"I had the Lamb/beef plate. It was delicious. The portion size was more than enough. I will definitely go back. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I just started eating at these type restaurants in the last year or so. Have hit maybe 5 of them and really haven't had a bad on yet. I'm a big chicken kabob guy, I get that dish first anytime I try a new place like this. And after eating here for the first time, I've been back 3 others to get the same dish!!!! It's very good, nice portion sizes and great taste. I order mine with rice, you can get French fries, salads, and other items if you want to. Chicken and rice works for me. They also have lunch specials, can't remember the exact times, but it's a good deal. Your order comes with a fountain soda. So it saves a few bucks. 
Overall the place is good, clean, friendly, and doesn't break the bank.  Everyone seems to enjoy the food, there busy every time I've been there, so they must be doing something right!!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mediterranean food I've ever had!! The staff is amazing and the owners are always there and very personable. I had the combination plate with filet mignon and chicken and it was PHENOMENAL! If you get French fries, make sure you try their \"secret fry sauce\". Top notch food and great service! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"}
{"text":"First timer with Greek food here, I've heard good things about this place, so I decided to give it a try. I got the Feta Fries w/ extra fry sauce, and Filet Mignon Pita Wrap. 

Feta Cheese Fries were super delicious! YUMMMMM, i'm biased though because im obsessed with Feta. Their fry sauce is really good, actually -- and the thing is, they never charge for extra sauces here. Which is DOOOOOPE. Not like some places where they charge you extra for everything.

So I've decided I'm not a fan of Hummus, but I guess if I was, their's would be good. It was in my Pita Wrap so maybe I'll just ask them to hold off on that next time. Their steak was perfectly cooked, and I got a size of Tzatziki sauce to dip my wrap in.. made it even more yummmz. I did get this delivered to me, so by the time I got to it, with all the hummus, the pita was a little soggy/drenched in hummus. I'll probably try a plate meal next time."}
{"text":"The low carb plate is expensive but amazing; super yummy and filling!"}
{"text":"Stephanos is great!pretty big portion sizes (couldn't even finish my salad!), and delicious meals. Pretty big sitting area, and you can enjoy your meal while listening to authentic greek music. Plus it is also right across from UNLV campus and I attend UNLV. Couldn't be better!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Food and service were great. We were there around 5:30pm 11/15 and the employees were very attentive. The restaurant is clean and well maintained. 

We had shrimp skewers, a beef wrap and baba ganoush. The baba ganoush was the best I've had in a while! It was smoky and chunky. 

They offer both white and wheat pita. Both were fresh.

Highly recommend! Food was good, we will be returning for the amazing service."}
{"text":"Ok i miss my aunt Lynn, so I felt like a gyro and went to Stephano's gyros. Outside it looks like a little gyro shop The place was a lot bigger than I expected. With a Mediterranean feel for sure.

 So I ordered the chicken shawarma gyro, and the gentleman taking my order suggested I get the combo with fries and I drank Ice tea and I got a side of extra chicken so I can taste just the meat. 

I checked in on yelp and for checking in they give you a free baklava. It's a small peace, a lot of times the baklava is too big at restaurants too sweet and too full of syrup this was just Wright. So check in before you place your order.for a free desert 

Food was really good, very authentic, tasted just like my aunts Greek cooking, I miss her so it was a nice treat. The free baklava was good enough that I went back up and purchased another one it was only $1.07 well worth it considering a lot of desserts are $4 to $8 dollars my lunch including the extra side of chicken was only $13 I was really full. I can't wait to go back and try the spanakopita."}
{"text":"I placed an order for Greek fries and a wrap. The person taking my order said that the food would be delivered within 30-45 minutes, because I lived half of a mile away from their location. The delivery took a little over an hour and was luke warm at best. That's why I'm giving them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite. Ordered a Gyro Pita on wheat pita. Everyone was very friendly. Gyro was pretty good tasting and decent sized. 
I ordered it without onions, but when I opened it up... It was loaded with onions. Boo! 
I picked them off and it was still pretty good. I don't necessarily mind the taste of onions (I cook with them, finely chopped) but these were large pieces.
I would come here again. Price for one Gyro is $7.30"}
{"text":"So happy they opened up a 3rd location near my house. The food is amazing! Reminds me of my mamas cooking.....but better. Shhhh!  They deliver, they cater, and it's always delicious. Hands down best Greek/middle eastern food in Vegas. Tons of vegetarian options too!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Everything I have ever ordered has been absolutely spectacular. Must try's are the Moussaka, Dolmas, shrimp kebab, and french fries. Greek salad is awesome too. Save room for the baklava for desert. Oh man! Drooling for more. The pita bread is so fresh and the perfect compliment to all those yummy dishes. Bomb.com!!!"}
{"text":"I have literally traveled all over the world and have found very limited resturants here in the United States with this caliber of true Mediterranean flavour. Hands down the best Mediterranean resturant a must go. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Solid Greek food. Everything is always great and they are quick. There are a few of them in the city and I have always had a good experience. This is the Only Greek food my father-in-law will eat because he trusts it  plus if you check in on yelp you get free baklava, can't beat that"}
{"text":"Would give 3.5 stars. Did online order.  It was easy!!!  Got a salad with gyro.  It was yummy!!!   Dressing was a little salty.  Next time I'd probably do oil and vinegar.    There were pits in olives.  Wasn't expecting that!   Tzatziki was yummy as well.  Got spanakopita. It was gross.  Greasy and didn't stay together.  Super salty too.  It should come with some tzatziki for moisture not raw onions. I'd come back."}
{"text":"It's located right across from UNLV on Maryland Pkwy which makes it a prime spot to go to if you go to UNLV and are sick of the food choices at UNLV. 

They have some good deals for students! Gyro bowl with white or wheat pita and a drink or even the typical gyro wrapped in pita with fries and a drink both just for $10 for students! They have great fries!! (I love good fries)

The serving size is decent and I usually take about half of it to-go because I can never finish it. So it's almost like two meals for $10 which is a good deal for us students!

I haven't had anything bad so far, even the baklava was delicious! It was a check-in deal either on 4square or yelp (I don't remember) but I wanted to try it and now almost always get one when I order with them! 

They have a good seating area and the back has pretty comfy seats as opposed to the regular dining area with normal chairs. 

Free WiFi is always a plus!

It's not usually busy, but when they do get busy, the food comes out just as fast!

Always a good place for something quick and cheap if you're a student. I come here generally twice a month."}
{"text":"Yum!  Great choices, fresh and yummy. Spinach pie incredibly flaky,flavorful gyros. Fast service.  Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I much prefer this over ZikiZ or Parsley's. The food here just seems to have more flavor than the other 2."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have yet to have a bad experience or meal from here. They're always fast and friendly and super convenient. I will continue being a regular customer!"}
{"text":"The best Greek place in Vegas!!! I kid you not. I had never heard of Stephano's until I noticed this location by my house... I love Greek food and on a curious night I decided to try Stephano's with my boyfriend. We each ordered the beef & lamb gyro, which comes with hummus and Israeli salad. The portion was huge, for me at least. First bite, we both looked at each other, eyes wide, with a smirk of pure satisfaction on our faces. The meat was perfectly seasoned, didn't have to add any salt to it. The pita was warm and soft, the lettuce and feta just added extra texture to the whole thing. We decided that Stephano's was going to be our only place for Greek. 

I usually only order the gyro, but yet another curious night, I ordered the grilled shrimp plate. OH MY GOODNESS! Words could not describe how amazing that plate was! Shrimp was cooked to perfection. They give you 10 shrimps, not the small ones either. The Greek rice.. ROUND OF APPLAUSE! It was so good I had to ask the manager what type of rice they used. He told me how it was made and I complimented how great they are! I definitely recommend the gyro and shrimp plate to anyone! You will not regret coming here.

Service is phenomenal! Every time I go here the cashiers or manager are so nice. They are super friendly and knowledgeable with their food. They also always give me some type of sample of their new desserts. My first time there, the cashier gave me a free order of fries and drink to go along with my meal. Just because. They're just super friendly. They are obviously all about customer service. And for that they gained me and my boyfriend as regulars :)

PS- Do NOT forget to ask for the garlic sauce, for all you garlic addicts, like myself."}
{"text":"Food was good! But hella expensive as if you were sitting down at a nice restaurant to be served.  They don't use saffron on any of their food so kinda bland.  So, Paymons receives 5 stars and Stephano's you get 4..."}
{"text":"I expected better food based on the high Yelp rating this place had received... 
I had a chicken kabob plate, here's the breakdown:
-chicken - burnt to the point that I had to cut off the outside of each piece, which was a really difficult task since the pieces were tough(overcooked)
-rice - delicious, but had black flakes from burnt chicken on top
-Israeli salad - very good, fresh and perfectly flavored 
-hummus - just mwah 
So I paid $14 for this and a bottle of water, and I received about $6 worth of food pleasure from the rice+salad side...and the said water;)) Oh, there's was alsonan average-tasting free baklava (available with yelp check in), so I guess that brought the food value up a little. Still, the baklava wasn't fantastic so it didn't help much. 
Overall, it was an average experience (thanks to the nice service from a Serbian girl), but I will not come again. 
On the 2nd thought, I might come for the bright pink pickled veggies from the condiments bar - those were absolutely addictive! 
Anybody knows what vegetable/root they are?"}
{"text":"Nice space, kinda hip, low key and comfy, kinda what you expect across from a college. Stephano's seems like a family run joint. The Gyro and all its components were great. What I found odd was how awful the hummus was. Maybe we got a bad batch or they just like to add construction paper to the recipe?"}
{"text":"Huge fan of Stephanos! You can't really beat the way they grill their gyro meat! 

Oddly enough, there seemed to be an issue with hygiene at this location. I had to move to four separate tables before finding one that wasn't layered with crumbs from the previous guests. But most notably was the graveyard of dead cockroaches that was located in the men's bathroom--there's no excuse for that. 

Overall, Stephanos is easily a 4 or 5 star location when it comes to the food. But due to my poor experience with cleanliness, I'll most likely stick with the Fort Apache location moving forward."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and got the lamb and beef gyro on a wheat pita. It was delicious and huge! I also had some fries with their fry sauce and it was super yummy. I thought the price was a little on the high side for such simple ingredients, but it was still yummy and fulfilling. Customer service was on point and I got a free baklava with a Yelp checkin. 

Not the best I've ever had, but it hits the spot. I live pretty close so I'll be stopping by from time to time."}
{"text":"Was exicted to eat here I like greek food. I have been to a few greek resterants and i never had any complaints. So, I thought how can you mess up pita bread and taziki?? Well, pita was hard and the taziki was nasty and watery. They should use greek pita bread and taziki go a little easy on the garlic."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! So delicious!!! Healthy, nice... We can't say anything else because we are in a food coma! New favorite spot!"}
{"text":"This place is so damn good. Authentic tasting for sure. Excellent staff and excellent food. It is a must try when in Vegas. Everything I have tried here has been amazing, and the portions are very generous."}
{"text":"Love their shrimp kabob plate! 
They give you 2 screwers with large shrimp. 
Everything is made fresh. 
Eat here a lot never had a bad experience. 
Definitely one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Love love love love this place. Never feel guilty when I eat it, great vibe/ambiance inside the restaurant, conveniently located and friendly service. I've always gotten the chicken kabob plate and it's just delicious! Fresh and authentic. Something about their rice and veggie side.. obsessed. Will continue to come here/Uber eats it!"}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food, these guys are the best in this area without any doubt. The food tastes incredible, the chicken is some of the best I've had anywhere. Definitely recommend checking this place out. It isn't cheap, but you get what you pay for here and I think their prices meet the quality."}
{"text":"Great food.  I had the lamb shank and it was fall off the bone super delic.  It was not too gamey, well cooked with great flavor.   They have a good selection of food and I hear the Gyro's are amazing.  I would repeat and try the gyro's next time.  Great service also."}
{"text":"After getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist, I checked out the Yelp app and found this place for dinner. It's located in a strip mall surrounded by crappy fast food restaurants. The inside is clean and spacious -- at least when it's completely empty it feels big. I went with the tri-tip shwarma which came with a salad full of chick peas, cucumbers and other deliciousness. There was also some hummus and pita with it. I loved the flavor of the steak, especially the crispy edges. There was plenty of spices and seasoning on it.

My kid went with the kid's pizza. It's actually just a pita topped with sauce and cheese. Good in concept, but not execution. It was a soggy mess and my kid barely ate it. Next time I'll just get him some chicken.

Prices were decent, staff was friendly and willing to help out a first timer there. If this place was closer to me I'd probably be a regular."}
{"text":"Very beautiful restaurant , inside and outside seating .the food is delicious specially there feta cheese fries (yumm) , friendly service ."}
{"text":"I love this place very friendly crew ,delicious food  . Everything  is good . Baklava one of my favorite"}
{"text":"RUDE!! DO NOT EAT HERE We love the location on s eastern which is always busy..great food and nice people..this one shares the name but  that's where it ends.  I always get the chicken  kabob rice bowl and substitute the Israeli salad w greek salad.  They really do it up at the eastern location.  

At ft apache I asked if I could substitute like I do at Eastern
.he said no prob..so I place the order get put my credit card then he says oh I have to charge you $2 more for feta on top.  I said no I never pay extra at Eastern
..her smirked shrugged his shoulders and saud well it's more here.  So we walked.  Huge mistake. .I do take out..business lunches..dinner...Now We will NEVER go back there.  There's better places where they don't gouge you. Are nice and appreciate the business.   I hope the lost $30 and future business lost was worth it to this jerk."}
{"text":"Had falafel wrap and fries combo..lunch comes w free drink.  Falafel was good, little too much sauce made pita soggy. Otherwise tasted good.  Fries were tasty.  Unlocked free baklava on yelp..it was delish!"}
{"text":"First time to try this place and somewhat disappointed. Went for lunch yesterday and ordered the Tri-tip Shawerma \"sandwich\" for me. Didn't get the combo with the fries and drink because I felt it might be too much food. I was right - there was a lot of meat, too much, in my opinion anyway. Although it (the meat) was very well seasoned, there were a few too chewy pieces and a lot of the tahini sauce which made the pita bread soggy. The Chicken Kebab Plate that my husband ordered was okay, nothing extraordinary. The hummus was good, though. Will I be back? Maybe, maybe not. I could give them another try but for me, there is definitely a better Greek Mediterranean place than Stephano's. Sorry :("}
{"text":"They have some of the best Greek and Mediterranean food in town.  It's a nice setting with great people working there.  The only recurring issue we have seen is that the wait for simple plates is way too long.  This is probably a result of cooking everything when ordered, but they can probably plan better.  Still, highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I have been here only once and had never heard of it before today.  I had the falafel wrap and split fries and a salad with a friend.  The falafel was fantastic. So light and crisp on the outside with a moist center.  

Even though the bread was good, I ended up skipping most of it and eating the delicious falafel and tahini sauce, because it was so much food. The fries were fresh and the fattoush was delicious. The fattoush in particular was highly seasoned.  We also had the baklava, which tasted good but was dry.   

In addition to the great entree and sides, they also have turnip pickles.  These are the best and not easy to find. 

They have a sign near the beverage station that says not to be shy about asking for more sauce. I like that even though they give you enough to begin with.  The service was polite, fast, and efficient.  It's a really casual place and we ate outside on their dog-friendly patio. There weren't any dogs but the patio was full."}
{"text":"Had this last night and it was delicious! I got the Chicken bowl, at first glance I didn't think it was enough food, but half way through I was getting full. The chicken was great, tender and juicy. Rice and salad were also great. The bowls also come with pitas but no hummus. Only downside! I'll have to remember order the plate next time. My friend had the Shrimp bowl, she was very satisfied, the shrimp looked great. 

Also I used Postmates and it was in my hands rather quickly!"}
{"text":"Great salads awesome gyros fast service what's not to like the kebabs are excellent especially with the garlic sauce"}
{"text":"Lovely food and great service. The flavors and quality of this place reflect the family owned values. We loved the food so much we had them cater an event for us. Will definitely be back regularly for the kebabs and mezzes!"}
{"text":"Best Greek Food in Henderson!!! Only thing needed is an APP for this place to make online ordering quicker."}
{"text":"Gyro was SO GOOD! Totally going back! 

Gryo = Pronounced like, Yee-row"}
{"text":"Whole wheat pita bread! Amazing. Will come again when I'm in Vegas. Not pricey and quick service. A lot of seating probably because it's near the university so they must get a lot of students!"}
{"text":"I work in Las Vegas at least 20 days out of month. I am from arizona. I was looking for good Mediterranean food. Found it !  Stephano's  is wonderful. I went to the newer location in Henderson today.  The food is fresh and made to order   Everything was good but The baklava was so good I ordered 2 more pieces to go.  Rob was so nice he gave them to us !   I am telling you best place in Vegas and Henderson ."}
{"text":"We first had Stephano's ADDICTING baklava at a past Yelp Elite event and we were in the area, so we figured we'd stop in for some sweets.

We shared a Rice Pudding and some Baklava which were perfect sized portions and not too sweet. We will have to return to try their entrees which seem to be highly yelped....ALOHA!!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time on Saturday May 3rd.  I had a friend in town who loves mediterranean food also, and I decided to search something new to try!  All the good reviews for Stephano's made me decide to drop by and I was not disappointed!  When you first walk in you order at the cash register, and then you pick your food back up at the front after a few minutes. They had a larger beer selection than I had anticipated which was a nice touch! I got the steak and lamb gyro, and both were \"de-lish!\" The steak was very tender (unlike many places I've been; where the steak can be quite tough), and the lamb was crisp on the outside and still tender inside.  Both cuts of meat had good flavor, and I loved the \"mixed veggies/salad\" that came with the plate!. You also get rice, pita (I chose whole wheat) and yummy hummus! The portion sizes were also good too, so I had plenty left over for dinner! I'd say... \"Try it!\""}
{"text":"Super yummy! I've been to the one on Maryland pkwy about a year ago, and it was good as well. I ordered a combo kabob plate (1 chicken, and 1 steak), and it was sooo good! The steak was super tender and flavorful, and I was super surprised at how flavorful and juicy the chicken was as well! No dry hunks of meat here (like at other \"kabob\" places I've been to). The plate came with hummus, pita, a Mediterranean salad, and some rice as well. I ate twice off of this one plate, and I believe I paid around $10-12 (sorry I forgot the exact amount). If you're looking for a quick Mediterranean spot, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I've never tried Greek food. This was a good change. It was absolutely packed with flavors. I particularly enjoyed the rice and the chicken ( Swarma) ((spelling)). The kiddos loved their meals as well. My daughters fries were awesome. 

The staff was super friendly and that made my ordering much easier."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this restaurant has 4 stars on here? Perhaps things were different when it replaced Khourys? The food here is the definition of mediocre. Considering it's location there's literally better options a few steps away. Flavor was dull and service was average. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"VERY GOOD GREEK! Gyro plates are VERY good, fries were excellent, cute little place with bench seating with pillows in the back. wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Flavorful food, fresh ingredients, relaxed atmosphere, welcoming staff, and fast service.  I was sad when the other Mediterranean restuarant relocated to Village Square (great food too and great new location), however have been pleased with the opening of this little gem. The staff are friendly and welcoming, the place is neat and clean even during lunch hour rush, nice covered outdoor seating.  The seating is hard chairs, and with the high top ones, metal chairs, so feels a bit more fast food for me than stay awhile with family, however there's plenty of dine in space, and I've seen diverse mix of clientele. The taste of each of the dishes I've had so far has been great (I've been there several times for lunch over past week due to a busy schedule).  The meat is tender and flavorful, the vegetables fresh. My view is that the menu is a combination of standards that you can get several ways (e.g. chicken shawarma in white or wheat pita, as a plate with sides, or over salad), and great options I've not had at some other restuarants  (e.g. feta fries topped with feta and oregano... fabulously tasty... and ultimate greek grilled cheese with mozzarella, feta, garlic sauce,  red pepper and mint flakes, olive oil...next on my list to try).  The portion sizes for most items are large enough to have leftovers for a second meal.  The quick service makes it great for lunch (I'll have to be careful of overuse as its right near my office, lol), however nice to grab for dinner."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE 'GETS' IT! By that, I mean they know how to take care of customers. It is not fancy, and that's exactly what I wanted in the middle of a trip to Vegas book-ended by expensive, fancy on-the-strip meals. We randomly stumbled across this place while driving back to our hotel from drinks at Mandalay Bay. I love Greek food, and when I saw the sign, I knew that's what I wanted that night for dinner. Didn't know what I was getting in to, and it seems this place is in-tune with social media like Yelp and Groupon--smart of them!

First of all, walked in 10 minutes before closing...My wife and I are not the type of people to push the envelope--I understand closing times and if the people working who had been on their feet all day didn't want to deal with me, I'd understand--there were a plethora of other restaurants in the area we could have gone to another place nearby. But the guy behind the counter warmly welcomed us.

Had the gyro plate. A ton of food, all really good, especially the pitas. Hummus was creamy and good...Not the best I've ever had, but still--good! They weren't busy with it being so late, but the food came out in like 3 minutes...Did they know what I was going to order before even I did?

While waiting for the food, we were making small-talk with the gentleman behind the counter, and I asked about the spinach pie (I was torn between that and the gyro). 5 minutes after the gyro platter came out, he showed up at our table with a half-order of spinach pie, on the house, just because he wanted us to try it. What the hell? That's service. (And he knew I was an out-of-towner, not like he was winning over a customer that can come by once a week).

A few minutes past 9, as he was walking to the front door to lock it and turn off the 'open' sign, he explicitly mentioned to us, \"I am closing up, but please take your time--no rush!\" (Not sure if I've ever had that at a small, counter-service restaurant like this before). He even kept selling beers to another table past 9.

I was impressed. Excellent, friendly service and pretty darn good food. I do come to Vegas 5-6 times a year for business, and will add this mom-and-pop to my repertoire of 'locals' places that I frequent. 

Finally, like the post below says, the icing on the cake--or shall I say 'icing on the baklava' was blue Powerade on tap. C'mon...You don't get that anywhere.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food great hummus..the sauce they give you for the fries is awesome. Gyros are really good! Gyro Portion size kinda small for the price. Free baklava w/ yelp checkin and is really good.you can get a tray for 10 bucks for 12 pieces to go and I recommend!! The whole menu looks good and I would definately go again..staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Shrimp A+
Chicken A+
Filet mignon C-
Different flavors different vines its good for a change. Its just the beef that disappointed me the most. Give it ago guys just a heads up in the stringy beef...."}
{"text":"The food is really good, But what I like most about this place is they willingly give you as many sides of dressing as you want without a hassle, attitude or saying \" its going to cost\". They obviously see a bigger picture when dealing with their customers and the person working the register is always friendly which is refreshing. I eat here weekly because of the little things."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! We had the beef & lamb gyro and the shwarma! Delicious!! The salad was incredible...pickled beets & pickled jalapeños too!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times (and also been to the one near UNLV).

The gyro's are delicious, and their pita bread is sooooo yummy! 
Baklava is sweet & tasty.
Service is great & the staff are friendly.
Prices are a little more expensive compared to other places, but overall, this place is good.

Avoid coming here right at the lunch hour though as they definitely get busy."}
{"text":"I've been to two of their locations, and have been eating here for years. The food is always good, the place is always clean, and the staff is very friendly. It takes a while to receive your order, however it's always fresh and hot. Very much worth the wait.I will definitely continue eating here."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL SERVICE AND FOOD! I will definitely be back on the next trip to Vegas. The Greek Salad and dressing were excellent."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Stephano's. They have been open for about 1 1/2 months.  Small restaurant but could seat about 40 - 50 comfortably.  The restaurant was about 75% full with a good stream of people ordering to-go.  The layout flowed well and they had a open kitchen to the dining room only separated by plexiglass.  Service was great!!  Young lady at the register was friendly and provided suggestions for a 1st timer.  The food was pretty good.  I got the chicken gyro wrap and a shrimp skewer.  Food can out in about 12 minutes with a busy restaurant.  There were 2 cooks, expo/food runner and cashier.  Well staffed for the size of the restaurant.  I would definitely recommend to try this place if you like Greek and Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I'm used to going to their location on maryland but when I tried this location, the service was even better! I love their steak kebabs and their salads are so yummy! If you're into greek food then you must try this place."}
{"text":"Stephano's never disappoints.  This was my first visit to this location, as I typically visit the one located near to UNLV on Maryland Parkway instead.  I love the decor of this location - it has a nice outdoor patio area, and it's decorated with bistro lighting and picnic tables.  The menus seem to be the same at both locations.  I opted for the loaded gyro fries, because who doesn't want a giant pile of fries, covered in gyro meat, hummus, and other delicious toppings?  Always a favorite.  I highly recommend Stephano's.  And, you get free baklava if you check in on Yelp!"}
{"text":"Their gyro meat was delicious to start off, just a bit too thick, or more than I've experienced. Unfortunately the Mediterranean salad dressing is way too acidic. I felt like I was drinking vinegar and my lips are on fire now. Over priced for what you get I think."}
{"text":"This is the best Greek food I have found in Las Vegas. Crazy Pita watch out!

We had the combo and of course the staple chicken shawarma on our first visit, just on a trial basis and to give a consistent idea of each Greek  spot we visit. Staphano's didn't disappoint and we will be sure to come back often. We even have Greek friends who are visiting next month and this is the first place they will go, especially after trying EVERYWHERE else that disappointed them last year."}
{"text":"It's was a great choice. Good food and fast service. Must try if your in the area. Always friendly staff"}
{"text":"Came in to town, and was craving some  good middle eastern food and had heard about Stephano's, so I decided to try it out. I was greeted by this very cheerful cashier by the name of Ron. Ron suggested the sandwich combo, and to upgrade the fries to feta fries. I have to say it was one of the best gyros I've had! Not oily, not dry, perfect. And the feta fries, good call Ron! I was stuffed then I heard about the nutella pita they have for dessert. It was bomb! Wish they had one of these in Los Angeles, I'd be there quite often."}
{"text":"I love this place! I haven't actually eaten in the restaurant, but have used their delivery. I found them in a coupon book and since I love Greek food decided to try it because they delivered. The food is amazing. My favorite is the Greek salad and the lamb and beef Gyro! The portions are huge and reasonably priced. The baklava portion may be small to some, but it is just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth."}
{"text":"I love Stefano's. Every time that I come here or order food from here, it is great. :)"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Fast and friendly service. The gyro wrap was a large portion! Loved the crispy fries with fry sauce."}
{"text":"Really good food. I wouldn't use their delivery service though they delivered my food 40mins earlier than my asking time. It was still good just kind of soggy."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! Initially the menu is overwhelming if you aren't familiar with Greek food but if you ask for guidance the staff is very helpful. There is a large, awesome covered patio area with multiple wooden picnic benches. My children enjoyed scampering about with other kids. Everything looks very clean. We will be back when we are on that side of town. I've heard a few complaints about pricing but the portions are generous and the drinks are free refill. We ordered an appetizer of hummus, three kid meals, one combo and my plate of awesomeness, One fountain drink and a bottled soda. The total was around 50$- seems reasonable to me for a sit down place."}
{"text":"Service was quick and the food was okay, but nothing that really impressed us. The baklava was a bit dry and the feta fries didn't have much feta or seasoning on them.  We did get a lot of good in our order (Gyro sandwich, Feta fries, baklava and a Gyro plate between two people). There's other Greek restaurants in Las Vegas that have better food that's less expensive, so likely we will not eat here again."}
{"text":"If it wasn't so close, I'd never go.
Ten minutes after ordering....
\"We're out of chicken. 40 minutes for chicken.\"
\"Ok, how about the beef?\"
30 minutes, still no food.

Just not a professionally run store. Frustrating that it's so close, I know I'll go back."}
{"text":"Yum! I got the chicken kabob plate. That plate is dangerous! Like the other yelpers said... the salad was very refreshing and perfect for cleansing the palate in between spoonfuls delish chicken and rice! The garlic spread on the size was amazing too. I couldn't stop eating! Also i tried their pickled turnip that was next to the drinks. Wow! Its super pickly but so goooood! Definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Had a nice experience at this place good food so we decided to get it for New Years 
Very disappointed in the poor service from the manager got a call 3 min before pick up that they ran out of meat and were unable to provide us with our catering order....
HAPPY NEW YEAR"}
{"text":"Yum. Got the gyro sandwich special with drink and fries. Everything was great. Huge cuts of gyro and hot piping fries. Nice ambience. Would return."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff & nice atmosphere. I usually order the 1/4 grilled chicken plate and OMG when I first tried it, I could not understand why I haven't been going here more often. That rice that comes with the platter is really some amazing shit. I also love the fact that if you show your rebel card, the drink is free! & for quantity & quality of the food, the price is worth it. Make sure they don't forget to include the garlic sauce with your order too :)"}
{"text":"Good food here the student special is the way to go. Some of the plates are a little too expensive for me for a lunch time food, but it fills you up! The fries are the best here, with the fry sauce yummmm! The student special is gyro with fries and a drink, that's the best thing to get."}
{"text":"Food was excellent once again. Service was great and they got our food to our table in 5 minutes. Checked in and got a free desert."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get some fast food around UNLV.  The gyros are good.  I even liked the falafel, but I was pretty hesitant to try since brown balls made from vegetables didn't look that appealing.  I mean they have a lot of other good selections, but I'm mostly a gyro guy."}
{"text":"I must've missed the Lunch rush because there was no line and the tables were empty. This is the freshest Greek food I've had in a while. 

I ordered their chicken shawerma wrap,  made to order. Having tried authentic Arabic and Mediterranean food in the middle east, I feel that it could have been seasoned a bit more but very well,cooked and tender, the pita bread was soft and warm and didn't have that \"store bought\" texture. The French fries was forgettable, I didnt try any of their special fries and their dipping sauce was good but nothing special. 

Service was quick and friendly. Indoor and outdoor dining areas are clean and ambiance is very laid back. I'll return and try their lamb dishes and give their fries another try. My search for the best shawarma in town continues!!!!"}
{"text":"I stumbled on to this place via yelp as I don't live on this side of town.  The food is excellent and fresh and tasty like all Mediterranean food should be.  All the dressing are homemade and the service was fast and efficient definitely one of the better Greek restaurants in town no wonder they have in business since 1998 yummy"}
{"text":"I order this place for delivery waaaaaay more than pizza! Lol! Anytime I'm hungry and working at home or just don't feel like going out, they're fast, friendly and the fries are still fresh when they arrive!! The salads too! The filet mignon kabob is a favorite, and the creme brûlée is actually very very good! I often get the chicken gyros too. I love everything I have ever ordered and the customer service is wonderful. I'm a fan and I have already gotten a few friends addicted too! Try it, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone says, but this place is DAMN GOOD!  One thing that I liked was that all you yelpers who check in at places, you get a free side dish!!  

This place was flavorful, everything was fresh, price was decent, lots of seating area, the only down side...it's 20 minutes away from where I live!  

I love their chicken!  It has the grilled taste/flavor that you need in chicken at places like these.  

Their beef/lamb schwerma was super good!  It's actually legit and sliced off piece by piece from a large piece of meat!  Unlike some other places who use prepacked meat (cough I won't mention who).  Honestly, if you're gonna open a greek restaurant and want people to enjoy their food, don't get that nasty prepacked stuff they use at fairs...Just my two cents.  

Their side dishes were also very good!  I got a vegetable salad as a side to accompany my combo plate of chicken, beef/lamb, I was satisfied!  It was so good that I couldn't finish it and wanted to save it for dinner so I can enjoy it again! haha.  

Also, if you have room for more food, grab a baklava for dessert at this place!  Great flavors and texture!  you won't be disappointed....unless you get a allergic reaction to honey ;-)  

I'd recommend this place to anyone craving great Greek food!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area, and love Mediterranean food. I stumbled on this place by the way of Yelp. Omg, it's so good! I purchased the kabob plate. Both the chicken and the filet mignon kabobs were super marinated and tender. You get a choice of white or wheat pita. I had the wheat, and It was moist with yummy humus. To top it off, it had a Isreali salad that was very good as well. All in all, it was a win. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had a lamb and feta pita for lunch. This was my first time eating here. The quality was good and there was plenty of food. The inside of the restaurant is very simple and basic but good for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"After moving to Vegas/Henderson, I found out that there are A LOT of Greek/Mediterranean restaurants.. like a lot. I think it's safe to say that Stephano's is my favorite one so far. 

They have a very extensive menu form plates to wraps to bowls. I always find myself ordering the gyro bowl which comes with rice, gyro, Israeli salad and a choice of wheat or regular pita. I love the salad which has great dressing on it and always go with the wheat pita, which has a nice sweet taste to it. 

I've also tried their seasoned fries and special sauce and it's delicious. The fries are a wonderful crisp and the sauce is just nommmm.

It's located in the same plaza as Smith's, Starbucks, Baskin Robbins and Robertos so there is ample parking!

Oh, and if you order before 3pm, they include a drink with all of their meals!"}
{"text":"Best in town! My fiancé is Middle Eastern and he agrees! Everything is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get Greek food. They have a coupon for buy two plates and get one free so we usually come and use that coupon. You also get a free drink with lunch plates or combos. 

Very clean establishment. Workers are incredibly friendly and accommodating. It's a very popular place which can make the wait for an order very long. The food is fresh and always has good presentation. 

My go to orders are the chicken shawarma, beef shawarma, and their fries with secret fry sauce are truly addicting."}
{"text":"It's the Best middle eastern food in seven hills 
Always fresh and delicious and great service 
It's a must if you love Greek and middle eastern food"}
{"text":"The food at Steffano Greek and Mediterranean restaurant tasted as good as it smells! It was delicious! Try the fillet mignon skewers or the chicken and don't forget to have some of their tropical iced tea and a baklava! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Another find thanks to my trusty Yelp friends.  Apparently this place has been open since 1998, and I have driven passed it going to work for the last 7 years and went to UNLV and didn't know about it either, well better late than never. I had the shrimp kebab for $12.95 that included two skewers of marinated shrimp, served with rice and one of the best hummus' I've had along with a refreshing Israeli salad that I could eat for a meal itself. They have a pretty large menu of all your Greek favorites. Also they have party platters and they cater, and the best part is they deliver to my work! Sorry I'm just being selfish :) Oh and try the baklava!"}
{"text":"Tasty! A little expensive but when the food came out, I understood why. I got the vegetarian platter with falafel and we shared a side of tabbouleh. Plenty of seating and parking.  I'd still prefer The Great Greek to this but this was good too."}
{"text":"My husband and I were excited because we used to go to the one on ft apache when we lived in that area. I ordered the gyro bowl and my husband the chicken shawarma plate. The portions were alot smaller than the one we used to go to and im not sure if it was because we came later in the evening but most of my husbands chicken was burned ends. Luckily he likes that sort of thing. But for $12 a plate for fast food it should be what you like. Still on the fence may try this location again at an earlier time."}
{"text":"This was a great Mediterranean eatery . We've eaten there before and loved it.  Last Saturday we had them CATER and deliver to our home , and all our guests lived it . Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"We stopped in to Stephano's for a quick lunch after running some errands.  I should have remembered that even though this is a strip mall store front restaurant, it's not exactly Fast food, they cook some items to order which tastes fantastic, but it takes a while. 

Today, I ordered the Filet Mignon Kebob plate.  This comes with 2 filet skewers, rice pilaf, hummus, warm pita (white or wheat), and a cucumber tomato salad.  At $14.95, it may seem a little pricy for lunch, but it's more than enough to share.

The steak is melt in your mouth tender, the rice is fluffy and flavorful (they make it with chicken broth), the hummus is creamy and has a nice lemon/garlic flavor, and the cucumber tomato salad is crunchy with a good vinegar bite in the dressing.  The pita is very good, but it's a brand you can buy in the store, so it does not need much description.

I also bought a box of Wedding Cookies for $9.99 to take home.  They were good, but a little dry."}
{"text":"I feel kind of bad for giving Stephano's 3 stars considering they have such a good reputation around town. I wanted to try them out for awhile (5 years to be exact) since I had heard such good things and finally did and unfortunately can see why I didn't rush eating here. I originally planned on ordering a falafel, but I wanted something that was a bit more filling and I didn't think a vegetarian option would do the trick so I ordered the gyro fries. I was expecting a bit more, but all I got fries with the meat on top and the sauce on the side... Really? I was expecting tomato and lettuce, kind of like how carne asada fries are made. Good thing I ordered it to go because I came home and definitely shredded some lettuce and chopped some tomatoes and it sure did make it 10 x better. The free baklava with Yelp check-in is delicious and I ate it even before my order was ready. Flaky and sweet, just how I like it which is probably the best baklava I've ever had.  The meat and sauce was good, but next time I'll probably just get the gyro and I'm sure I will be pleased. Although this is a fast food type of place, the inside is pretty classy and is decorated like a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Boyfriend: Are you going to be able to fini....**sees one bite left on my plate** ..nevermind 

You know the food is good when you're doing a little dance while you eat it!

I got the lamb and beef gyro. So good! Sometimes gyros are so full that it's really hard to eat. But this gyro had a good ratio. It's definitely something that I'm going to just crave.

My boyfriend got the lamb and gyro plate. There was so much food and well worth the money. They fill the plate with meat. He loved it! He was a little hesitant at eating Mediterranean because he doesn't love it but he loved this food! 

We also shared some feta fries. It was good, but I didn't love it. I think after a couple of bites, I wished it was just regular fries. It was just kind of hard to eat with the melted cheese cause it congeals, so I ended up cutting the cheese with a knife. 

I'm a huge fan, and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not bad. 
But not a knock-out for me.
No better or worse than most of the other kebab/schawarma joints in town.

I had the \"garlic chicken\".

When I lived in Los Angeles, I frequented a middle-eastern (Armenian really), garlic chicken place called Zankou chicken....it's the only thing I miss about Los Angeles....and I've been looking for a facsimile in Las Vegas for 4 years, but sadly it does not exist.
I'll keep looking, but I'm not optimistic. 

If someone were to open a Zankou in Las Vegas, there would be lines around the block.
If you don't know Zankou Chicken, go to Yelp Los Angeles and check it out....over-the-top reviews."}
{"text":"The best gyro sandwich I have ever had!  Every time I come down to Vegas, I always make it a point to stop by Stephano's for a gyro.  

Try their gyro pizza also.  Amazziiinnnggg!! If you haven't stopped by already, you are missing out."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I come to Vegas often and every time I do, I have to stop by Stephano's for their gyro sandwich.  All of their food is amazing AND they added some amazing breakfast foods too.  The gyro waffles are too good.  The staff is very polite and helpful.  I recommend this place to all my friends if they are in Vegas.

If you are in the area, you MUST stop by and try it for yourself."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars ...The food was great, the service was great, the restaurant is very clean with stylish modern decor. A bonus is the glass wall that let's you watch them prep food in their spotless kitchen. 1 last bonus is that you can pre order from their website. We will be returning tomorrow."}
{"text":"First time here and its delish!!!!  Wonderful staff too!! Ordered the chicken shwerma salad. Yummo!! If you're in the mood for greek this is the place!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal fresh Mediterranean food! Every time I'm in Henderson we look forward to eating here. A little on the pricey side but well worth it! 2 kabob plates with rice and Greek style salad and pita bread and one coke was $30  but the quality justifies the cost!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! I am one of the pickiest eaters ever! I can honestly say everything here is wonderful and tastes homemade! Best baklava I've EVER tasted!!! Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Winner Winner!!!!  Chicken Diner!!  

My wife and daughter and I did takeout for lunch.  Beef Schwarma bowl, beef plate, and Gyro Plate. The food was fresh and excellent.  I have a very sensitive system and this food treated my body right. Will definitely go here again!!!

Thank you Staphano's!!!"}
{"text":"I randomly found this place via YELP and mannnn this place is sooo good!!! I have a lot of Mediterranean, as I am that...lol but this was the freshest and most delicious food that I have had. The restaurant was super cute and CLEAN and the decor was really nice. The staff member who helped us was really nice and made good conversation. Def. Will be coming back here when in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"This is a great little joint to grab a bite to eat for lunch or dinner. Service was not as quick as I thought, but that likely means they are taking the time to actually cook you fresh food which is a good thing. So if you aren't in too much of a hurry and want a place to relax and have a nice meal in a place with a good vibe then check them out. Food was fantastic and much healthier compared to most fast food or restaurant options around."}
{"text":"I totally have garlic breath now! Can you smell it? LOL....

I went here for lunch solo today. I wanted to get out of the office for a bit and it was a nice break. They had the World Cup on 3 screens which was nice and it wasn't on overly loud so you could still have a conversation.

I ordered the Garlic Chicken Sandwich combo with fries and a drink. It was $8.32 and it was a lot of food! I managed to finish the sandwich which was loaded with tomaotoes, chicken, onion and garlic sauce on a  good Panini type bread, but had to leave a lot of the fries, which was a shame as they were super fresh, and nice and crispy!

They are always very nice, and the same woman has been working the counter for a while and she is always very welcoming. 

Yummy fresh brewed tea too!"}
{"text":"I happened to be in this strip plaza as I needed to get to USPS which is a few door down from this place.

I go in & the place is dead, just 1-2 others.

I check out the menu not really sure if I want to order, as I know what good Greek & Middle Eastern food is, & restaurants rarely get it right.

I noticed they had Mousaka & I said WOW, I haven't had Mousaka in years. I said that to the girl behind the counter & she just looked like I spoke a foreign language. No smile, no warmth, nothing.

Every time I asked her a question she didn't understand a word I said & I was starting to get frustrated.

I wanted to know what was on the Israeli salad as far as dressing. She didn't even know & kept telling me nothing. I was amazed they don't put any seasoning on their salad, so I kept insisting she find out. How can someone work in a restaurant & NOT know what's on the salad that everyone gets (it comes with almost everything). 

She had to go ask the guy sweeping the floor & he didn't even understand. Finally I'm told it's lemon & I asked, because I don't use vinegar. It's unhealthy & it certainly shouldn't be on an Israeli salad.

Even when going up to get my food I asked if they only had plastic forks & she again didn't understand my question. Then after responding yes, she turns around & laughs at me. LOVELY.

Sure enough, it had vinegar on it & so I never ate it. In fact it was swimming in vinegar.

My only complement was mousaka, it was VERY good, but it was very small & for almost $12 it wasn't worth it. I never took the pita & of course the salad was a waste as it just sat there.

As I was leaving I asked her how much it would be if I got just the mousaka, not the salad or pita. She rang me up. I said NO, I want to know how much. I had to basically answer for her because she never could understand what I was saying.

She wouldn't give me a better price so I walked out & they didn't make the money.

I doubt I will be back. I can't stand cold ignorant people & the fact that 4-5 times I had to struggle with her understanding basic English & questions about the food, plus the expensive prices, they just lost a good customer, but knowing what I know about these types of people, they won't care."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a Greek restaurant in my area then I found Stephanos on Maryland great food really happy with the meal my son and I had"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, healthy with excellent service. Steak kabob bowl is top notch!"}
{"text":"Nice staff, decent food, but they lost the fifth star on consistency, I ordered wine twice and got a pretty different amount from one to the other."}
{"text":"I grabbed take-out from Stephanos on my way to visit a friend in Anthem this past Monday night. From the look of the place, everyone (dine-in customers included) orders from the counter, which added to the home-cooked flavor of the place.

Based on the menu, I have a hard time understanding why this restaurant bills itself as a \"Greek\" place because there were so few greek options on the menu! They serve mostly the standard middle eastern fare, which is more than fine by me. The baba ganoush was really good, as were the kofta kebas and chicken shwarma. I was really excited to see kibbi on the menu (can be hard to find in Las Vegas!), but I was pretty disappointed - no meet in the shell, I think it was just bulgar wheat. Maybe it was just some sort of greek kibbi I have never seen before, as it was spelled differently. They offer whole wheat pita, which I thought would be interesting, but we preferred the white.

I live very far away from this location (and not close to the other location either), and it wasn't good enough to warrant a special trip just to eat here. However, I would definitely go back and for those who live nearby, I highly recommend it for weekly middle eastern takeout!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located across from Student Union, I decided to drop by between my classes to grab a quick lunch. 

I ordered their Beef&Lamb Gyro, which was a small portion for ~$7. I have had gyro in the past at this shop in DTLV which blew my mind away. Unfortunate to say but gyro here fell short in the flavor and ingredients used. 

First,  beef and lamb are char-grilled and cut up in slices. My gyro wrap came with roughly around 5 pieces which was plenty for such a small wrap. 

It came with tzatziki sauce which I believe is made with sour cream and cucumber. It tasted like ranch dressing to me but it was good regardless. I wish the sauce was not just on the two ends of the wrap, but inside the wrap as well. 

Service was quick but lady was impatient with me. I will be back to try more items."}
{"text":"We had not found a Greek restaurant since moving to Las Vegas and were pleasantly surprised by both the good taste and outside, evening dining venue."}
{"text":"I must admit their food is pretty good but there are a lot of good med places in town... that being said their customer service is pretty horrible... I waited 30 minutes for my food and it was not busy... to add insult to injury I watched the owner's friend walk in 15 minutes after me and get his large order in about 10 minutes... it's obvious what happened ... they pushed my order aside for the owner's friend! It was so obvious... I won't be back and suggest if you want to be cared for as a customer take your business elsewhere"}
{"text":"the veggie kabob plate is so filling & the veggies come cooked very well... not soggy at all & just crisp enough!! I got a small Greek salad on the side but had to save it, that's how big the plate is! the salad that comes along with it it tasty I'll probably just get an extra side of that next time!"}
{"text":"My dining experience here has been A+. The staff and manager are great and always accommodating my diet like subbing hummus for meat and other odd requests. I just picked up lunch from here again today and I am very happy. The consistency, customer service, and delicious Israeli salad are why this is my go-to for lunch. I love that they have a rewards program."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!! We wait little ...but love to get fresh food !! Food was so tasty and inside was clean. 1st time I tried this location but definitely I come back !!"}
{"text":"Great Food, love the authentic variety of Greek and Mediterranean cuisine."}
{"text":"Had been here a couple times prior to tonight. Had ok experiences. Thought I'd give it another try because I love Mediterranean food. Ordered a gyro wrap. I understand that it's only $7, so not expecting much portion wise. But what I was served was fairly ridiculous. There were 2-1/2 to 3 slices of gyro in it. Had more tzatziki than meat. I hope this was a mistake by the person on the line and not the standard serving. Flavors we're alright. Pita was a little dry. Really want to like this place because it's so close to home but next time I'll just suck up the drive to Parsley at Trop and Decatur. They nail it every time."}
{"text":"I had  a living social deal from this place for a long time. Finally we managed to go and use it on the day before it was about to expire.. and I'm glad we did. We had 2 beef and lamb plates with Israeli salad, humus, and tzatziki plus 2 pita breads. They have a little pepper bar as well and give you extra tzatziki if you need more. I must say I really enjoyed the food there. The staff was very nice as well and the place is big and very clean. Nothing more to add. Would love to go back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  I think the meals are a little high considering but I keep going back as it is pretty dang good."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and very good.  Employees were friendly and offered menu selections.   Been back twice in the first week they were opened."}
{"text":"Was over in the Anthem area for an appointment, and came across this place  for lunch.  Clean and contemporary, I ordered the filet mignon tips wrap on white pita bread.  The tips were out of this world!!! Sooooo tender with nice texture and a hearty, meaty flavor.  Can't wait to try a plate next time I'm on that side of Henderson!"}
{"text":"Great shawarma and tabuli!  Everything was delicious. What really took it over the top was the great guy taking my order. He had a big smile and went out of his way to make sure my order was complete. Oh and I'm a huge fan of the baklava. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I'm a Greek food brat and have always gone to Yassou several times a week. Stephanos is walking distance from my house so I've had my eye on it for a minute. I ordered the cheese gyro which was outstanding and the cheese fries which were good, just not 7 dollars worth but I won't hold t against them. I will definitely be back to try more stuff."}
{"text":"This place levels all Greek food in any corner of this town. Hands down with flavor, presentation and baklava! 

I've tried a bunch of places. I will now go out of my way for Stephanos when I need Greek! 

Great atmosphere too. Very hip and new age. Great condiments, nice selection of drinks including alcohol. 

Make your way over and try it. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Liquor license is all in -- took the hubs today and he freaked out over Stephan's amazing offering of international beers; thought the food was pretty good, too.   Even better though, Stephan's going to turn the joint into a disco/club/? Friday nights and stay open til 3...  so now Chef's got another late night joint to take the boys when the kitchen closes... as I peacefully, happily, contentedly sleep...hey, he's much prettier than I am, so beauty sleep is required, not optional..."}
{"text":"The lamb and beef plate was delicioso. Took a friend and enjoyed the experience. Will go again. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"I'm a Greek food fan. This place is good, great location near school, and the food is delicious. We had the Greek salad, pita bread, rice and kebab. Everything tastes amazing. The stuff were friendly. I will definitely come back here to eat when I go to class."}
{"text":"Always consistently good.  I am lame and always order either a gyro salad or gyro plate.  Food is always hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"This place is alright. The service is mediocre definitely not the rudest but not the friendliest either everyone seems to rush you through  and there is always a wait most of the time its a long long wait  for your order. But overall not that bad knowing all this before going in. The food is great my personal favorite are the Gyro's there always great. So if you are looking for some good Gyro's this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I have never actually been in person to Stephano's, but I work in a nearby medical office and we occasionally are catered their food in the office. I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite places to eat in the area. The pita and hummus are to die for. The rice is out of this world awesome. The caterer always brings the food on time, and it is still hot. They deliver fast and friendly, and the quality is just amazing. It is a must try."}
{"text":"I'd read some reviews of Stephano's before but never really had it on my list. I was going to cruise up Eastern to Silverado Ranch or Richmar for lunch today, but since I was in the very immediate vicinity of this place, I popped inside to look at the menu. Noting that the various pita wraps are mostly priced at $6.95, I went for the beef and lamb gyro on a wheat pita and used the Yelp check-in for a free baklava (normally $0.99).

The wheat is perhaps the first thing you'll notice when you take a bite. It's a bit of a sweet taste and different from a regular pita, and it has a pre-made feel. Some may not like it, but I didn't mind too much. Then you'll realize that there's a very generous amount of meat, up to six slices of not-so-thin gyro meat in my wrap. I was pleased since I honestly didn't expect that much meat. The tzatziki sauce isn't as special, but it's vital for the creaminess and bit of sourness. Tomatoes and onions complete the experience with some texture and acidity. I thought that the overall flavor profile was balanced and tasty, but not especially daring with the spices. It's a safe gyro choice and a solid lunch portion.

The baklava is a fairly small triangle. It's a very honey-ful pastry of phyllo layers with pistachio, and it's advertised as being made from scratch daily. Perhaps that's what gave it the softness that I don't normally get from baklava. I'd say that the baklava is definitely above average as far as these things go.

I probably won't be drawn back here very often due to its remoteness from me, along with the presence of other Greek places nearer to my neighborhood, but I think it's worth a shot if you're in the area. Grab a couple of wraps or a plate-sized portion of whatever appeals to you."}
{"text":"Holy cow I love this place! The portions are a bit big but everything is so delicious!"}
{"text":"We love Stephano's. It's consistently delicious, the staff is super friendly and they offer vegan and gluten free options so you can bring everyone in the family!"}
{"text":"Hectic. Not disabled friendly. Not enough menus. 
Food is OK. Not great. Hummus is bland. Tzatziki is pretty good. Rice is steam tray dry. We each had the beef and lamb gyros.
Just nothing specisl."}
{"text":"This place was super delicious! We ordered takeout and even by the time we got home the food still maintained its integrity. The flavors were very distinct and zingy. The only reason for the docked star is that our chicken was slightly burnt but other than that, I highly recommend this place if you're after reasonably priced delicious Greek food!"}
{"text":"Probably the best gyro sandwich I've ever had hands down.  Their menu is extensive, but not overly so.  The meat almost has a bbq'd flavor to it, but still keeps its traditional roots.  I have no need to eat at any other gyro place locally!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! I had a gyro and feta fries. The meat was seasoned well and the fries were cooked perfectly. And the Taziki sauce is yummy. My husband has a combo plate and the rice and meat was delicious too. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came in during the week for dinner. Parking was abundant in the large strip center which was hassle free. Stephano's has another location in Henderson but this was my first experience at either location.

I placed my order at the counter for the beef and lamb gyro combo and utilized my yelp check in for the complimentary baklava. The young gal behind the counter was friendly and my food was ready within a few minutes for pick up. Overall the hummus, wheat pita, thick sliced gyro & salad were plentiful and yummy.   

Overall, a good experience at reasonable prices. I'll return here again when I have a craving for Greek food."}
{"text":"I went to Stephano's for lunch yesterday before leaving Las Vegas back home. Being Greek, I am always super judgmental when it comes to Greek restaurants. The decor was gorgeous and the food was delicious. 

The baklava was what extremely stuck out because I am so picky when it comes to my baklava. It was to die for!!"}
{"text":"Ordered online which was a great option, put exactly what you wanted and no second guessing as to what you placed and the order was perfect!

I ordered the Lamb and Beef salad it was a big serving, I was able to finish about half a ate the rest when I got home. (It comes with Pita bread of your choice)

Ordered a side of hummus with mixed pita bread, wheat and white. The small size is plenty.

I wanted to get the baklava because when you check in for the first time you get a bite size baklava for free! I ended up saving it for another I had the rice pudding, another yummy desert."}
{"text":"Food is good had the Gyros. Check the menu for the price. Greek chicken salad is also very good."}
{"text":"I love the Mediterranean flavors, the rich flavors and robust spices. Shawarma, gyros, hummus, kabobs, tabbouleh, falafel, cucumber salad... I like it all. I've eaten at this location a couple times though, and I must say, it's a bit too salty for me. 
Service is good, prices are moderate, I was just disappointed by the saltiness in the items we've ordered."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!! Very fresh shrimp, chicken, and Filet Mignon. Clean. The service was great. I'm glad we stopped in this place"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick business lunch a couple of days ago sadly the old restaurant that was here has changed. It is still Greek or Mediterranean but definitely not the same. Now it's more of an overpriced café Rio type chain without the fun of getting to watch the food being prepared. I was also very unimpressed with their menu it was small Font size and laid out in a way that was somewhat confusing. I had the filet mignon salad. The portion sizes as far as the actual meat were concerned were reasonable and the flavor was quite good but I felt as though the salad was very haphazardly put together for $13.00. With their vinaigrette it was a very enjoyable salad they did not skimp on most of the required elements of the salad. Overall flavor five stars on the salad. They lost a star for this one though. I feel that it is ridiculous that there was a tip option on the point-of-sale register. It's mainly cafeteria style with no actual service to speak of other than them bringing the food to your table so why in the world would I tip you?"}
{"text":"Excellent Gyro wraps and excellent Baklava.  The fries are the best I have had at an all Greek restaurant, very crispy and seasoned well.

The price is on par with quality and they have a big menu.  I am going to try their shawarma next time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and so well priced! I have a family of five, and eating out is usually so expensive! I couldn't believe the quality of this place, a whole delicious chicken, the rice, the israelí salad, the hummus, the pita bread, everything was finger-licking good! And under $24!!! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The shawarma itself as meat was good but the bread or as in the menu the \"wrap\" it's not a wrap it's just the bread and its hold the Chicken in a taco kinds of thing, so it make it VERY VERY messy and not a true Turkish shawarma WRAP.... And still looking for the perfect traditional shawarma in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was great!  We had the lamb shank and the meat was falling off the bone good. I loved the hummus, soft warm pita and the tomato/cucumber/onion salad.  We also had the feta fries. Yum!  I should never have eaten so much food, but I couldn't stop.  Great quality!"}
{"text":"The best chicken shawarma in Nevada for sure. I'm obsessed. Delicious hummus. I always get scared to try grape leaves because they never compare to the ones at the Green festival but I think I'll give it a shot. It's so hard to find delicious really fresh and tasty and healthy food. I just found out there's one by my house & they deliver!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place !! 
I Aways  come here when I'm in the neighborhood..
My favorite thing to order is the Greek grilled chicken salad, at lunch time not to heavy on the stomach.
It's amazing!! 
You've got to try the Gyros the meat is Aways fresh 
They give you a lot of food for your buck .
The service is away great , friendly kind and courteous.,
The restaurant is always clean.. 
One of my favorite place to grab lunch ."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, yummy smelling foods from the open kitchen and BONUS: 2 clean, fresh smelling stalls in women's bathrooms! You know they keep the restaurant clean- inside and out! Definitely recommend. 
Will try their Henderson location next!"}
{"text":"The gyros here are great.  Nice place to stop by if you're near UNLV."}
{"text":"All the world needs Greek Salad and this is the place to get it!  I usually order mine with the chicken or shrimp skewer. Delightful. There house dressing is also great.  Very family style atmosphere. The only thing I'm not fond of but think it is a testament to their good reputation is that they are always super busy so my wait tends to be longer than I prefer.  Other than that, great food!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!!!!! I asked for 8 pieces of pita and a lot of hummus to go. After stating that he has had more difficult orders before, the guy recommended we get the bags of pita instead. He was rolling his eyes and was extremely rude. I agreed thinking the pita would be served warm just in larger quantity like it always is.  I get back to work and look in the bag to find actual bags of pita from the smart ass worker. (It was a bag I could buy from Walmart off the shelf) Worst service ever and so rude making faces and rolling his eyes the whole time I used to eat here 3 days a week. I will now inform all my coworkers at the hospital across the street to not come here. I would give 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"This place was a great find! Thanks yelp!! I wouldn't have found it with out the deal, but didn't really need a deal anyways. Everything was very reasonably priced. He was also really helpful in helping me figure out what on the menu was Vegan. It was apparently only the falafel but it was still absolutely delicious! The hummus and pita bread that it came with were also equally as good!"}
{"text":"They have great food. I just wish they would complete my order correctly, sometimes they forget the wheat pita bread I request. They offer a free drink with your order till 3pm, which is cool. Overall the service is good...."}
{"text":"My husband's friend ordered lunch for us today. He ordered the 3 chicken kabob plates. I liked the chicken kabob the most because it was well marinated and cooked. The rice was not that great because it was bland  and a little mushy.  The hummus and pita bread was decent. I liked the salad that came with the platter.  I would eat here again based on the my carryout experience."}
{"text":"I love Stephano's! I've tried their gyro and their gyro bowl and I've been satisfied with it every time. The first time I did order rice and the rice was undercooked but since then it's been . The baklava is amazing as well. I know you can order a tray of baklava if you want it for an event. The one good thing about this place is that they have a variety of sauces. So if you don't like the tzatziki sauce, there are other sauces to pick from.  The French fries are delish! My kids love them because they are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and actually I really look forward to it as well. They even gave me a free soda when they were really busy as I was waiting for take out! It's definitely well worth your time to come here even if you may think it's more pricey. Parking can be a pain in that center but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"I've had Stephanos catered into work before, and it was awesome! The chicken kebabs, rice and salad are so delicious. I picked it up to eat at home with family for the first time, the service was great. Everyone is so kind, I came in a bit early but they made sure my food was started ASAP. So I received it fresh and hot. I can't wait to eat here again and try more items off the menu! Favorite Greek spot in town!"}
{"text":"Stephanos is close to where I work so I eat there often.  Everyone behind the counter is very friendly and everything on the menu is super delicious.  I usually get the house salad with either grilled chicken, or steak or gyros.  I have yet to get the feta fries but they look like it´s a must on my next visit."}
{"text":"Always my go to Mediterranean place in Vegas. Everything is delicious and fresh. My two year old loves it as well. We always get extra kababs for left overs since they taste just as good warmed up."}
{"text":"This is for 3.5 stars. I really wanted mediterranean food and since this is on the way home from work, I stopped here on friday night for takeout. I ordered the chicken schewarma pita sandwich and two pieces of falafel (@ 99 cents each). The guy at the counter was cordial but not enthusiastic, kinda felt like he was getting through the last part of the day. I waited for my food; it was a short wait. There were two other parties in the dining area, which was nice. From the outside, it looks really small, but on the inside, it's a square-shaped space, and nicely decorated. Located across from UNLV, in the largest strip mall, with various other restaurants such as the Lunchbox. Another customer for takeout was behind me. I noticed that for yelpers who check-in, you get a free piece of baklava. If you're a UNLV student, you get a free drink when you show your ID. 

I went home and couldn't wait to devour it. I let my husband have a bite of each (he's on a weight maintenance plan) and he liked it. He's never had this type of food. I did like the food- the pita was soft, the tahini sauce tasted good, but the chicken tasted like it was charred (think charcoal), and I couldn't shake it. I've been particularly sensitive lately to certain things, maybe it was an off day, I don't know. I really wanted to like this place. I thought it was me. And when I had the falafel, I also got the same charred taste, but I also noticed that it was slightly burned, too. My favorite place for mediterranean is all the way in Summerlin (Sultan's Grill), which is far away from our area, so I thought I'd try a convenient place. I would try this place again, maybe get a plate next time. Plus, my husband's never had mediterranean food so it be worth trying again."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy in my tummy every time! Stephano's is our go to spot when we want a break from salads or cooking. Their food is always fresh and hot when we pick it up. One of my favorite things about this place is their consistency. I've ordered here several times and I typically get the same thing, a gyro bowl and every time it's as delicious as the last!

The hummus as is always fresh and I'm obsessed with the garlic spread (or maybe it's butter). The portions are also nice and filling. It is quite pricey, usually about $32 for the two of us, but you certainly get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times on my lunch break. Their hummus is amazing and their Israeli salad is super fresh. I like that I have the option of getting a whole wheat pita. 
I have gotten their falafel and kabobs and both did not disappoint. The staff members are super sweet and friendly."}
{"text":"Best Greek food. Reasonable prices. Huge portions. Great food with authentic Mediterrean flavor. Love going here. Ask for a punch card to earn a free meal."}
{"text":"Aw, this place replaced Khoury's, and they've definitely done a great job remodeling and making use of the space. It's a nice, clean cut, fast food joint kinda like the vibe of Chipotle, but serving Greek food. 

Their fries are not bad at all if you like the old old old school fries that BK used to serve. I can't really explain the texture but, it reminded my of the old BK fries in the breading.

I think the food items we got were okay. Tasted like fast food (lamb and beef plate). I LOVED their lemon garlic sauce and cucumber salad that came with the combo meal. That stuff is legit!!! 

The lamb and beef combo plate, the meat was a bit too salty for me, and price point is way too high for what they offer. For instance, a chicken kabob plate is $13 and has rice, hummus, cucumber salad, and two mini pitas. 
Their small feta fry is $5.50. 

Their \"bowl\" is $10. That isn't too bad I guess, but this is how much you'd sometimes pay at a dine-in. 

I'll be back to try a few more items in the future."}
{"text":"Really love their Gyros! For a while my friends and I would just crave a gyro~ I heard from my friends that if you order a few of the meals that aren't gyros they aren't all that noteworthy like the Gyro.  Their Baklava is good too, almost remains me of the ones I had in Turkey, but not as moist. Still a nice place to get a delicious gyro~"}
{"text":"Free baklava with check in and a free drink during lunch with the purchase of a plate?? Sign me in! My friend Loren decided on this place for lunch and since I haven't had Greek food in a while, I was like, why not. I remember going to the location by UNLV and I wasn't very impressed with that spot. It's been a few years and it's a new location, so I figured I would give them a shot. 

I ordered the shrimp skewer plate ($14.95). All plates come with rice, Israeli salad (cucumbers and tomatoes in a vinaigrette) and pita and hummus. I'm trying to limit the amount of carbs and sugar I eat, so I opted for no rice and to substitute it with salad. Easy suggestion right? So guess what comes out? I get rice after I specifically said NO rice. The Israeli salad has been substituted for regular salad. That's not what I wanted!!!!!!! The girl offered to change it, but I know what happens to food when you send it back, so I just ate it in disappointment. The shrimp was a little too charred for my taste. I ate the rest of my food except for the huge pile of rice. And to pay $16 for food that I didn't even finish was kind of a bummer. I tried to give you another chance Stephanos, but I just can't like you. 

P.S. The baklava was good though. That's the reason for the 3 star and not 2. Moist and not too sweet!"}
{"text":"The best lamb and beef gyro I've had! The meat is as tender as it can get. 
Combo meals come with a drink and fries, great deal for the price. 
Make sure to try to the fries! The seasoning makes them so addictive. Size large is easily enough for three people."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese - this sounded amazing until I took a bite and the feta cheese was overwhelming and made the grilled cheese way to salty. I love salty foods but this was too much and I couldn't take more then a few bites.

Gyro plate - portions were good! Taste was on point.

Feta fries with \"secret sauce\" - secret sauce is just mayo mixed with ketchup, fries were okay also."}
{"text":"Wow! My wife and I stopped here on the way back to orange county and literally it was amazing! Probably the best french fries I've ever had, the freshest chicken and the garlic sauce was phenomenal! We got the beef and lamb gyro as well as the chicken kebab plate! So amazing we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place but was disappointed with the outcome. I stood at the counter for a few minutes before anyone acknowledged me. I ordered a chicken kabob meal and a salad to go. It was a bit pricey for what I consider quick serve Greek. I then waited for at least 30 minutes for my food. In fact guests who ordered after me received there food before me, I finally asked someone if my food was ready because I thought they had forgotten about me. Finally got my food went home and it was just ok. Not worth the time and money for what we received.

*update* I have given this place another try and it is definitely delicious. Still a bit pricey and the wait is a little long but the food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"If you're looking for excellent Greek food, look no further. Succulent chicken, tasty hummus & excellent pita. The only thing stopping this place from getting 5 stars is the rather long wait times (order 30 mins ahead of time) and the so-so customer service."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant when I was visiting my brother for some personal business matters. I've always been a great fan of greek food....my brother and I ordered a beef gyro and I have to admit it was pretty good. The only thing that I didn't like was the price. I felt that the price point for what you are getting is a little high."}
{"text":"This was by far the WORST EXPERIENCE I have ever had with any business! I ordered through Door Dash and called the restaurant immediately to confirm my order. The girl who answered the phone said sorry our system is down and we did not receive the order. Therefore, she said, they would have to wait for the driver to get there to give them the order. I told her, I could give her the order. She said unfortunately they can't do that because they can't \"trust\" people. They need to make sure it's been paid for. I was like okay. Anyway, once the order arrived at my house, I got a vegetable skewer instead of the chicken skewer I ordered. The order was clearly right on my phone. I called Stephano's and asked to speak to a manager. A girl came to the phone and I told her the situation and asked if they could \"rectify\" the situation. She said she needed to ask the owner. She came back and said unfortunately you will have to go back through door dash because it was their mistake!!! I was like what!! Door dash didn't prepare the order. After that I asked to speak to the owner. Wow, that was the wrong decision. Not only did he get loud and continue to talk over me versus listen, he hung up in MY face. Then, when we tried to call back, he continued to screen our calls and hang up the phone as soon as he answered. I HAVE NEVER AND I WILL REPEAT NEVER RECEIVED THIS HORRIFIC  UNPROFESSIONAL SERVICE FROM ANY BUSINESS, ESPECIALLY THE OWNER. I will never support this business again. I will also tell everyone I know! This was such a simple situation they could have been handled so differently. Stephano's lost our business over NOT wanting to rectify a situation over $5 dollars!!! It's amazing business' like this still exist. Keep treating people like this and your demise will be sooner than later. Unreal. I FEEL SORRY FOR THE POOR LEADERSHIP THIS STAFF HAS. He was a textbook example of an egotistical person with no capability of taking any responsibly. HE LITERALLY COULDN'T EVEN APOLOGIZE. A matter of fact, the employee handled the situation far better than the OWNER. It clearly shows this place doesn't care about the people that PAY THEIR BILLS. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"We are always looking for good Greek & Mediterranean food!! This spot did the trick. 

We both ordered the original beef and lamb gyro combo, but upgraded the regular fries to feta fries. One large combo and one small combo, which we didn't need the small because the large was plenty!! We had the entire small fries left over and there was 3 of us eating. The gyros are a good size, not oversized and stuffed with meat like most places. 

Besides maybe being a little pricey, it was great. It is quality food made well."}
{"text":"Great Service, Quick and Easy - Can't wait to go back. First meal was the traditional Gyro - Fry sauce was outstanding. - All ready planning to order the Gyro Fries on my next visit."}
{"text":"Oh boy! Do I love this joint.  My go to place to dine by UNLV based on very simple restaurant principles (Affordability, customer service and delicious food) 

Its located in the plaza in front of the UNLV student union.  Cafe rio, wells fargo and Einsteins bagels are the main landmarks to identify this location

Service: You're greeted with a warm welcome by the guy behind the counter.  Patient and willing to explain any of the dishes and the different sauces you can get.  

UNLV students:  Get a free drink, just show them your rebel card

Yelpers: Check in for their baklava! Rich and flaky, a delicious treat that shouldn't be skipped

Food:  The food here is tasty.  Hot, packed with flavor of the Mediterranean and  with good portions.  I always get the chicken shawarma bowl which comes in a pie container filled with rice, chicken pieces.  Served with 4 pieces of hot HOT pita (white or wheat) and israeli salad (which you can substitute for fries or hummus).  You get so much when you order which is great, everyone wants to leave a restaurant full.  It also comes with tahini sauce (sesame seed paste) which is amazing.  Combined with the amazing forces of Garlic, this sauce is amazing with the chicken shawarma.  
Add some pickled jalapenos, it makes the bowl even better. 

Overall, Guy I love this place.  A place of honest food, Stephanos on Maryland should be experienced by all. 

**They have a new location in Henderson and honestly the food tastes much better at this location"}
{"text":"We ordered food for pickup and it was done early, which was awesome. We ordered chicken gyros, pita bread and hummus, and some baklava. The gyros were just ok, I just didn't know you had to add onions to them, I thought gyros normally come with onion, so it definitely would have been good if it had onion. The baklava was really good! Will try this place again and see if the next time is better!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place has changed a lot over the years... I first went to it what like 10 years ago when it was Daily Chicken... at that time I thought hey a place across from campus (UNLV) that's not fast food.... that was when I got hooked on their chicken with the garlic dip... YUM!!! Since then I've gone over the years.... the place is now called Stephanos... family owned... which I like since my family owns a business in town too... awesome decor when you walk in... you order at the counter..... and they give you a pager letting you know your foods ready.... its a nice little spot to hang out, have some great food and even some hookah... I myself love hookah and this this place makes the best hookahs in town.... they also have wi-fi so you can find me hanging out doin some homework with friends while having a good meal... the food speaks for itself... everything i have tried has been great! i luv luv luv the fries too!!!!  all in all, this is a great comfortable spot that really has some excellent food at a great atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"We go there from time to time for lunch. I like their food a lot - meat, sauces, everything.  
Once we had guests over and I bought a large platter with all kind of meat. 
Unfortunately all the meats - chicken, beef, everything was very salty. All guests noticed that. 

After that I went a couple of times for lunch - same issue, everything is so salty. 
I don't know what happened, hopefully it will be fixed soon. We stopped going for now, but we will be happy to come back!"}
{"text":"I've had way better Greek food in Las Vegas.  The lamb shank was good but salty the rice was mushy & not a lot of chicken on the chicken kebab.
Also, they were playing electronic dance music. NOT RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"This is the best Greek restaurant in town!

I have been ordering the #5 lamb and beef gyro plate since 2003. It comes with mounds of succulent gyro meat, an Israeli salad, pita bread, and hummus. all for about 11$. 

Also, Bacchus would be envious of the beer selection! There are over thirty beers including many Greek ones. You can also order ouzo to drink with your Greek beer. 

I had a crisp Hillas for 3$ which is reasonably priced for an import. 

Don't forget to check into yelp for a free baklava!"}
{"text":"First time I came here I was exploring to find a place to grab lunch before my next class. I'm very happy I came across this place! They have awesome vegetarian options service is always good. Not to mention, students get a free drinks with the purchase of a plate! 
I've been recommending this place to my friends due to how close it is to campus and it being a much better (and less crowded) option than the places located on campus.
Many options and very good food! It's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Very good Mediterranean food.  Very friendly staff.  I will go back any time I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Really tasty! We do a lamb gyro, filet kabobs and chicken kabobs and it was all very good. The pita bread comes in wheat or white - our group did a mix and both options were very good. The hummus is fantastic. Large fries is a very good sized portion and really are really good.

The only thing that stopped the 5th star is their aren't very expeditious. It wasn't super slow but was palpably not quick. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best!   I deliberately and extensively researched for affordable, quality Greek food in the Las Vegas area, and I was led to believe (by reading yelp!) that Stephano's would be worth trying *** n o t ! ***  When i arrived at lunchtime, there were only two other customers in this place, which is across from the UNLV student center.  THAT should have been a warning!  I ordered my favorite dishes to go:  spanakopita (spinach pie) and hummus.  When I eagerly took the takeout bag to my car, the smell of the food teased me too much, so I gave in to my temptation to sample the food before leaving the parking lot.  I'm so glad I did, because the spanakopita (hailed as their \"signature\" dish) tasted awful.  it seemed as though it had been baked, then sat out for a day or so, then deed-fried, then microwaved before serving it to me. In short, what they served me was more like a Greek hockey puck than a delicious, crispy, buttery delight.   

Even worse, when I returned to the store to demand a refund, the cashier laughed and told me he didn't know how to process a refund! (huh??).  He insisted I wait for the manager to return (from where, i have no idea).  Like a fool, i did wait, and wait, and wait...until I spotted a tip jar on the counter and told the cashier to just give me a cash refund from the jar, so I could be on my way.

Bottom line...there wasn't one person in this place who seemed to know what they were doing or seemed to care about what they were doing....and they even admitted that they don't even eat the food served there!  What's that all about??  

Too bad I can't reduce it's yelp score to zero!"}
{"text":"After a real bad experience in Wicked Spoon, this was surprisingly good. It is cheap and taste good. I do recommend it occasionally."}
{"text":"I was really hungry and saw that this place had solid reviews, so after checking out what they had online, I ordered a beef shwarma plate, a side of falafals,  and a lamb gyro. 

The beef shwarma was super salty,  the hummus bland,  and nothing stood out on the plate.   

The falafals were the worst I have ever had,  dry tasteless,  and dense. 

The gyro meat was at least not overly salty,  but not much care was put in the assembly, and it was basic, nothing special. 

A total let down, and there are so many other spots nearby that surpass them. The only thing they had going for them, is they were open later than other businesses that serve similar food."}
{"text":"First time here. Loved it. The cashier was really friendly to my friend and I. He was really helpful in choosing the dish and helping me decide. Definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"Great place and service I definitely will be returning. First time ever having Greek food too! It was an amazing experience."}
{"text":"Really good and is a little pricey imo but you get a good amount of food. It taste really good."}
{"text":"Ordered this off Postmates and my family loved it! The salad was fresh and the hummus was amazing !!!"}
{"text":"Loved it and I'm so glad they opened one on this side of town. 

We ordered the half chicken plate and the lamb and beef gyro plate with extra yogurt sauce, garlic spread, and a large Israeli salad.  

As expected it was delicious and tasted exactly like the one in Henderson.  

Portion was plentiful and we had left over to take home. 

Those of you from California who are crazing Zankou chicken now have a substitute and don't have to drive 5 hours to get it.  I highly recommend it and I hope you like it as well."}
{"text":"Excellent choice. Flavorful, juicy gyro meat is hard to master and they did a good job for 4 people. Next time, we'll try the kabobs."}
{"text":"Amazing food and nice casual restaurant! Generous portions, healthy options, and very delicious food. I had the chicken kebab plate with amazing white meat chicken with super flavorful rice and the most delicious pita and hummus. I can't wait to go back, I found my new favorite spot! They have beer & wine available which is a nice touch at a casual dining establishment. Everything looked great and service was good! Everything cooked fresh made to order."}
{"text":"Lately I have been Mediterranean food obsessed. There are so many great options in this town and I am on a mission to try as many as possible. I've had this spot bookmarked for awhile and I finally grabbed some takeout last weekend. The restaurant is in the same shopping center as the Smith's grocery store tucked in the same corner as the Baskin Robbins.

There were several items on the menu that appealed to me, but I narrowed to the Kofta Plate to go. I also used the Yelp check in offer for free Baklava. The meal ended up being enough for two servings so I had dinner that night and lunch the next day.

The Kofta was excellent in flavor and texture. The rice looked simple, but had great flavor. The Israeli Salad was fresh, but had more tang than I expected. The hummus was tasty, but a bit chunkier than most hummus I've ever. It's personal preference, but I like my hummus more creamy. The pita bread was nice and soft. The Baklava was great and some of the best I've had. 

My to go order didn't take more than five minutes to be prepared and was priced fairly. I liked the food and would definitely return if I was in the area. This restaurant would be a five star in most towns, but Vegas has serious Mediterranean food competition."}
{"text":"Falafelickin' good! I wish I live/work closer to this place; I'd end up here almost everyday like I do at Yassou. Like my lunch buddy Arvin T. who is obsessed with Vietnamese food, I am obsessed with middle eastern mediterranean food. At one point in my life I ate gyros salads five days a week (Daphne Camarillo days).

Stephano is a good choice for the browns, yellows, puerto ricans and even haitians. Even the people from zulu nations would like it. A meat lover like me relish at the ribeye wrap or the half chicken plate. Where as my wife on the Insanity diet prefers the falafel plate.  

When I retire, I think I'll go into the Greek/Medi cooking business since I promote them so much."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. I'm kicking myself that it took me this long to try. Love Mediterranean food, nothing original but simply amazing. Tzatiki was very good; well seasoned and refreshing. Hummus was super traditional but well done. If you're looking for a super simple but well executed Mediterranean meal then this is the spot. Oh and the baklava was bombbbbb!"}
{"text":"Food is great here excellent wraps and always great services I am from the Middle East and this is really close to authentic great food #Stephanoslv"}
{"text":"Thanks for the free baklava with check-in! YEE loves you!

Stephano's is a great for a quick lunch time bite. I recently had their shrimp kebab greek salad, and it was great. Lettuce, olives, tomatoes, onions, feta, and char grilled shrimp. Would have loved the addition of another veggie though and if the shrimp was warm. Came with warm wheat or white pita. Always a nice plus. Portion was huge. I couldn't finish it. 

We ate at the patio area, which was really pleasant with the good weather. The food was super prompt.

Just one note to the staff: please stock napkins by the condiments and utensils. Some of us are messy. =)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice since our first shining experience and it just hasn't been the same.  The rice pudding is good, but the dolmades (they call them sarmas) are falling apart and full of liquid.  The spanakopita has way too much phyllo.  There are still many good things about this place but I don't think it's the best greek food I've had and I will still be searching in the area for something better."}
{"text":"This is our favorite go-to for Greek food. It never disappoints and the food is always fresh. Beef and lamb gyro is incredible. Garlic sauce is AMAZING but don't get it if you're on a date. Lol!"}
{"text":"Falafel was outstanding. Whatever you order (I love the kababs), order some on the side. The tahini will even come in handy with the chicken.
Hummus is good - but not amazing. Needs to be a tad more creamy. That's my only teenie complaint.
My only real issue: the table buzzer scares the crap out of me every time it goes off!
Enjoy..."}
{"text":"As a lover of Greek food I am so happy I found Stephanos! The food is always fresh and amazing! 
I always order the chicken kebab plate and believe me you have enough food for two people. I haven't eaten inside the restaurant yet since I usually order on food delivery apps at work but I am so happy this gem is in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Got a flyer in the Mail so, me and Hubby decided to check this place out .. It's in the same shopping center as Starbucks.. glad we came in because the flyer didn't show ALL the great food choices they offer! Healthy choices..  first time & ITS DELICIOUS.. chicken kebabs were grilled perfect, not dry or over seasoned . Also ordered two Gyros one on white & one on wheat: you can't tell the difference. French fries came with a fry dipping sauce: YUMMY.. you can dine in, take out or delivery (charges a $3 fee)
Plenty space to eat.. outside patio is lite up with fancy cute lights.."}
{"text":"Best gyro I've ever had! I highly recommend getting the feta cheese added. Great atmosphere, comfortable seating, and ultra-friendly staff. When they get busy it might take a little while for you to get your order, but you will not be disappointed. I come here on average once a week and it's the best $10 I can spend for lunch."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in LV! THey have all of these sauces too that go so well together. With the meat plates you get rice hummus and tabbouleh!"}

{"text":"This place is so good...my fave here is the shawerma salad.  The food is always so fresh.  I make it a point to stop here on every trip I make from Los Angeles.  Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing food! There has not been one thing here I have tried that I didn't love.

I'm from LA, and I make a pit stop at Stephano's every time I'm in town. 

I've concocted my own specialty, off menu item. Shawerma salad. It's amazing!!

You can't go wrong with anything you order."}
{"text":"I ordered a gyro with fetta cheese, and the hummus appetizer Togo online. It was already ready to go when I got there, and it was delicious. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"best place to get a beef n labm Gyro in vegas, for sure."}
{"text":"I have found the best Greek place in Vegas!!!  The servers know me name from what I ordered eveytime I called.  This is a sign of their amazing customer service.  My regular order is the filet mignon kebab plate ($16.16), subsitute the Israeli salad with lentil rice.  The food quality is extremely consistence.  Never once have I disappointed with my order.  The meat is perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection.  You don't have to add anything to it.  The portion is also good.  I always have extra for the next meal/day.  The baklava is amazing!  I ordered the 1/2 tray back in December and finished them before my relatives visisted of out of town.  I was so loyal that they gave me the Punchcard without me asking for it.  I have never considered myself a fan of Greek's food until I found this place  I strongly recommend this place before you go elsewhere.  You will not regret your money and time with this place.

Cons:  I tried to the location by UNLV twice in the last month and I wasn't impressed with it at all.  The lentil rice was dry, hard, and stuck together; and the portion was much smaller.  The only plus side is that the UNLV location offers teacher's discount - you get free soft drink with your order."}
{"text":"Called ahead, still took over 30 minutes to make my food!!! Only two wraps, stood in the store for 25 of those minutes. Three of the employees just stood around watching their phones. I've been to this store 25+ times and tonight was very disappointing!!! Service has been going down hill in my opinion"}
{"text":"The falafel was very good. I had the wheat pita to go with the meal. Very tasty, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken kebab plate ($13) with whole wheat pita and extra salad instead of rice. Service was quick and friendly, portions were generous, and everything was tasty (the warm, fluffy pita being the highlight), but the chicken was slightly over-charred and dry. I would return, though there's such a plethora of Mediterranean restaurants in Vegas (including at least three within a couple of blocks of here) that I'd like to try a few other options first..."}
{"text":"As someone who has family in Greece and has lived in Thessaloniki for 5 years, I can honestly say this place is better than most restaurants in Greece. In fact, I would say that this place is healthier than most Greek (gyro) places as well. Also the baklava here is SO delicious!!! Even if you're not really into sweets at all, please try a piece of the blaklava (it's $1). I come here every couple months or so and I'm never disappointed. You guys are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service. Noise level high as right next to UNLV but wont stop me from coming back! Great food and baklava!"}
{"text":"I haven't had good tabbouleh since Emily's Deli in Minneapolis.  Stephonano's tabbouleh is amazing and the pita bread is crazy delish (better than Holy Land).  I plan to check them out again and order something besides salads."}
{"text":"Another vegas bust, first time my girlfriend has ever passed on felafals. Feta fries were pretty bad, there was a glob of some white melted cheese over them all, and their feta seemed a little rubbery. The lamb/beef gyro was average, overall I'd say 3 stars If prices were decent, but we just dropped a little over $40 on what we thought was going to be a cheap delivery dinner night,  shit, all I wanted was papa Johns 2 large for $16!"}
{"text":"Simple ingredients......flavor explosion! They get extra points for \"low carb\" options on the plates (substitute the rice/pita for double meat for about $2). I had the filet mignon kebab plate, and it was delightful! Super tender meat that was seasoned just right. The acidity of the Israeli salad complimented the kebab. Everything looked really fresh, and it really wasn't that expensive. It's only a few miles from my office, so I see myself coming here semi frequently."}
{"text":"All I can say is yum! I loved it so much the first time, I went back the next day. Both times I got the veggie pita. The flavor and texture of the veggies were amazing! The vegetables were perfectly grilled and juicy, the tzaziki was delicious and the wheat pita was nice and soft. The fries actually had flavor and came with a yummy spicy sauce. The baba ghanoush  was good as well. Not my favorite type, but still good. They have tons of vegetarian options which helps a lot because I don't eat meat. I can definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Still delicious after all these years. I spent a lot time here during my time at UNLV--eating lunch, doing hw, killing time, and trying to figure out what's in this Israeali salad. The food is much better than the student union. The fries are a must; the gyros are excellent; and the Israeli salad is too good. 

Whenever I drive down Maryland Pkwy., my heart skips a beat to see that this place is still here."}
{"text":"Gyros are very good here. They give you a lot of meat, which is a huge plus in my book. Customer service was excellent from the moment I stepped to the register. This place also has a nice atmosphere. Also, I got a free baklava for checking in here. Wow! Those things are great! Good finishing touch on my meal. I recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"If you are in a super big hurry this isn't the best place for you. It isn't slow by any means but it isn't fast either. So just be aware of your needs and your expectations. We went in for lunch because I was craving Mediterranean food and I was THRILLED to see the sign for this place, and right away the staff was friendly and helpful. I wish j would have asked the girls name who took our order, but she was cool and very hospitable. 

Then I went to check in on yelp (about five minutes into waiting for our food when I see that you get a FRWW BAKLAVA for checking in!!! Omg.) I RAN up to the counter. The girl laughed pleasantly (understanding my plight entirely) and said \"here's an extra piece for your boyfriend too\") what an angel!! I mean, I have been at TONS of places that won't give you the check in bonus if you check in after you buy your food. I can't even tell you how many times. But this girl, she was so sweet and didn't think twice about making our day. 

She then went on to tell us about the other locations in town and I will say this: I am now hooked. And it is because of her. I hope she reads this and I hope she knows it is about her because people that provide amazing guest service are the type of people that make this industry great. (She was young, brown hair, ponytail/messy bun, brunette, and a great smile) 

I know robots are supposedly going to take over the food service industry, but you would be hard pressed to find a WALL-E who could make your day like this girl did. You simply cannot program human warmth  hospitality. 

I don't know how your pay structure works, but if you are the owner or manager, she deserves a raise. If it helps (to search for the check) we ordered a gyro plate to share (which she was so helpful in describing and was honest with us about how much food it was) and we got two drinks. I got an iced tea and he got a coke/Pepsi. I am a 28 year old blonde lady (thin, 5'6'' with my hair in a bun) and my boyfriend is also blonde (clean shaven, 6'0'', not heavy, but with a belly for sure) hopefully the girl working will remember us. Oh! I pointed to the baklava and I asked \"what is this called again?? I am drawing a total blank\" and she answered me with kindness and eagerness. :) 

Anyway I really hope this doesn't fall on deaf ears because this experience really was a great one. 

There aren't many times in life (especially as you get older) where you get to be wholly shocked by the authentic kindness of an individual, so when it happens, you remember. 

I remember you, brunette young lady with the great smile who gave us the extra baklava. You are awesome. Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Perfect for takeout dinner. I usually stop by once a month for the steak combo dinner deal."}
{"text":"My friend loves Greek food so I went to try this place with her for the first time ever and thought it was pretty good! I recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"Four stars for nice counter service.  My gyro had generous amounts of meat.  Unfortunately it was overall just average tasting.  3 star food."}
{"text":"It's about time I reviewed a place I have been eating at for over 4 years.  Good middle eastern food with UNLV specials, Stephano's gives that free drink with plates or sandwiches with a side dish.  They have a frequent diner card so the 10th trip is free.

I am partial to the kofte sandwich lately, and I have always been a big fan of the lentil rice with caramelized onions as a side dish.  The falafel is decent when I really crave it, but I try to avoid majorly fried food if I can.  The plates are good to get if you are super hungry, because they include meat (gyro, chicken or beef) and onions, tomatoes, pita, tzatziki, and Israeli salad.

Another big plate is the Vegetarian plate, and it comes with spanokopita, hummus, tabouli, dolmas, falafel....so it is quite huge.  The other thing I like is the tropical iced tea here.  Big screen TVs, huge couches, and yummy food make this place a convenient stop for lunch."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. I've tried many different things on their menu but the gyro bowl is definitely my favorite. I was a little disappointed with their gyro sandwich and I found that their gyro bowl is a far better deal. What I mean by disappointed is the size and amount of meat in the sandwich. I ordered a grilled vegetable kabob along with the sandwich and it did not really satisfy my hunger. The kabob included 6 pieces of vegetables. I probably won't order that again. 

Their gyro and shawerma bowls are the way to go. The bowls include some of the best rice I've ever had from a 'take-out' restaurant, choice of meat, Israeli salad (tomato, cucumber, onion, seasoning), plenty of fresh pita bread and a side of tzatziki sauce. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The service is great and the food is awesome. I always get way more than I should but they have so many great options it's hard to leave with just one menu item. I highly recommend this restaurant. They also deliver which is always a plus."}
{"text":"My fave lunch spot by UNLV! Perfect fry sauce and my fave shawarma west of the Mississippi. The staff is awesome and they have great special deals for staff and students."}
{"text":"Just had a chicken kabob plate with a side steak skewer with my family. Took a little while because we had a pretty big order. The order took about 20 min and I got the steak skewer a little cold so I got a little restless but the manager Rob quickly made up for it, he definitely went out of his way to make us feel compensated for the little delay on the food. This is the first time I've been here and I'm happy to say their customer service is high on their priority list. I'll definitely be coming here to try out more of their tasty meets. The food was amazing, taste was really savory! Recommend this small place for a great Greek plate. He also added in some free Baklava with our food as well! It was delicious! Rob is a great manager."}
{"text":"Actually, you should also be aware that their low carb ribeye plate is basically a to-go box piled high with delicious meat. I had enough steak for 2 lunches and an omelet!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and it's cooked fresh to order. Their steak kabob plate plate is my favorite and my husband loves the lamb kabobs. The meat is juicy and tender and falls apart. You don't even need a knife. The rice is buttery and delicious and their hummas is amazing. I also had their gyro meat (Lamb, Steak & Chicken) are all super tasty! Can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Stephano's since well before I knew what Yelp was. It was a nice option to have across Maryland Parkway when I was going to UNLV.

Fast forward to last night. A few of us Yelpers decided to go there after the Jeff Mitchum gallery event. OK so really, we went there so that Tony T could use his soon-to-expire Groupon. Somewhat unfortunately, we came in during an open mic night. The performers weren't awful, but I guess we weren't really in the mood for the loudness.

Anyway, I ordered a pork souvlaki sandwich combo (fries + drink). My total with tax was under $10. The pork was delicious and the sandwich overall was just oozing with flavor (and literally oozing with the sauce). The fries were also perfectly cooked. Overall, it was a very satisfying meal.

Make sure you check in to get your free baklava with a purchase of $5 or more. Theirs had the perfect amount of sweetness. I don't like it when baklava has too much of the sauce that makes the dessert way too sweet and sticky."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place when my kids were wanting Subway and I was looking for something different.  It is great if you avoid bread, like me, because you can get a double meat plate and it makes it a lower carb meal.  

Since my first visit I have been back twice.  There is a lot of food on the plate, so I tend to share with my kids or bring home food for later.

It is easy to over order and I thought it was a bit pricey at first, but there was so much food that it became more than one meal.

Everything we have had there has been excellent!  The location is deceiving.  It is near many \"fast food\" choices like Subway, Starbucks, etc.  but really, this is \"sit down restaurant\" quality food."}
{"text":"This place is good!! I have been looking for a mediterranean restaurant where I can have a quick lunch or dinner and this is the place is my spot from now on! We ordered their Gyro bowl and a Combo plate with filet mignon and chicken . The gyro bowl came with Gyro, salad, and rice with their special sauce. Oh, also some pita bread as well. The combo plate came with hummus, salad, one skewer of filet mignon and chicken, and some pita bread as well. Everything tasted good and the portion was perfect. we also got a free baklava (Yelp check-in) and it was delicious as well."}
{"text":"Place was nice and clean but the food was horrible we ordered 2 gyros and more than half was stuffed w cheese and huge onion pieces"}
{"text":"The chicken Shawarma is AMAZING.  I love coming here.  The food is great, the staff are friendly, they have really good Greek and Mediterranean food and parking is never a problem.  This is one of my go-to lunch places in Henderson."}
{"text":"Delicious and great service. The boys loved the food and put it on their \"restaurant go to\" list."}
{"text":"Deliciosa comida, me encanta el lugar!!! Muy agradable limpio, el servicio rápido y el postre Baklava delicioso!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great, review is for catering line/ Customer service. I called 4 times in one day to set up catering order for 20. 
I Left multiple messages. No call back. 
I called the eastern location and left a message for catering (actually spoke to a live person!!) They assured me I would get a call back that evening, saying she must have left for the gym (?!?) But she will call me back as soon as she returns. Nope. No call back.
Next morning, I got a call stating they could not do same day/orders within 24 hours. Ugh. 
Fortunately, i found another wonderful kabob place down the street that bent over backwards to prepare my order, even calling in an extra cook to make sure I had food for my meeting."}
{"text":"1 star for having tri-tip and filet mignon shawarma. (I had the tri-tip...yum!)
1 star for some legit tzatziki sauce. (I don't usually eat dairy...but I'd make an exception for this any day of the week.)
1 star for free baklava upon check-in.  (Not my thing, but the b/f really liked it, and I liked the free factor.)

No stars for the falafel - regardless of other reviews you might read.  They were just okay.
No stars for the chicken shawarma...very dry chicken, as if it had been made hours before and was left sitting out, waiting to be served.
No stars for the hummus...very bland.

My advice?  Get the tri-tip, skip the chicken, and try something you've never had before."}
{"text":"First off the place strikes you with all the high class lighting and outdoor patio.  From the road you would think that you are going to a swanky outdoor New York style restaurant.  The food is delicious and the people are nice.  The Hummus and Falafel are top notch and you get a lot for the money.  It's not a cheap meal though.  Stephano's will easily run you 14-15 per person."}
{"text":"I am so so glad that this stephano's opened up closer to my house! I frequent their Maryland location since it's right in front of UNLV. Seeing as I just graduated, I don't think I'll be visiting that location anymore. 

Anyway, I usually order the shrimp kebab plate or a salad with shrimp! Their shrimp is really good & cooked very well. The plate comes with rice, protein, a little salad, hummus, and a side of pita bread (choice of white or wheat). Definitely able to eat half and get full so I save the other half for my next meal. Their salads are also pretty big and so refreshing!

I haven't actually dined in here (just take out) so I can't vouch for their service but every time I pick up my food, they've always greeted me & never got my food order wrong. So I think that's pretty good lol"}
{"text":"Great food, I had a greek salad with extra feta and it was really great.  Will order again."}
{"text":"My first gyro ever! Very delicious! The restaurant is very clean. The staff is friendly. And they have a patio with cute string lights. I will be back!"}
{"text":"On our last trip we dined at this local restaurant's Henderson location and were disappointed so the owner reached out in a meaningful way, $20 coupon, that we gratefully accepted. This time we ordered gyro, say yee-row, plates that included a Greek salad, pita bread, rice, tzatziki sauce and hummus. The lamb and beef yee-row, if you will, was freshly sliced, bountiful and juicy.  Everything else on our plate was very good with the exception of the bread which was dry."}
{"text":"This mainstay, 15 years, on Maryland Parkway, is very casual as befits an establishment catering to a college crowd though none were in attendance this evening.  We each ordered the lamb and beef gyro platter at the counter.  Our plates included an abundance of gyro meat, (2) enormous whole wheat pitas, hummus, an Israeli salad and tzatziki sauce.   Also available was a tray of pickled carrots. All the food was fresh tasting and very filling.

A rating of 3.5 would be more accurate."}
{"text":"It was our first night in Las Vegas after a long flight from the east coast and an arduous car rental process at Fox Rent A Car so we were looking for something quick and easy.  My wife and I each ordered lamb and beef gyros plus a soda.  This is a fast casual restaurant where orders are placed at the counter and an employee delivers them to your table.  We also tried some complimentary pickled turnip that was nothing if it wasn't colorful.  The gyros were pretty good though the pita was from a package and there was a wee bit too much grilled onion and a wee too little tzatziki sauce. I am not sure if this mini chain has deteriorated or we caught them on an off night, but our experience in the past at the UNLV location was much better."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place but it definitely could of been a better experience; especially since we almost went to Paymon's before choosing Stephano's. 
-Waited to order while the manger went at it with an angry customer over charges..she handled it well but the chick actually taking our order was way too distracted by it all and totally distraught. 
-Food wasn't bad..the feta frys are SUPER good, make sure to get lots of the secret fry sauce. 
-When I ask for extra taziki more than two times and only get one..that's a let down. My boyfriend even mentioned how much I love my sauce. 
-They forgot my pita with my kabob bowl, so that sucked. 
-The falafel is super basic and not very flavorful. 

Overall I'm not impressed but will give it one more chance in the future in hopes they were just having an \"off\" day."}
{"text":"This is a great place! My favorite place to get gyros. They taste amazing! It's as close to Greece as it gets. The only thing I don't like... the last couple of times I've been there, it seems to take forever to make my food. The place is also not that big, and on each occasion it was practically empty. I guess it's worth it since it's my favorite spot to get a gyros. Nevertheless, highly recommend if you love Greek food!"}
{"text":"Solid food and great service. Feta fries are bomb dot com. Portions are generous, hummus wasn't too shabby, falafel balls were amazing, rice was flavorful. The baklava was Devine!"}
{"text":"Stephano's is my lunch spot across the street from UNLV, I was thrilled when they opened this Henderson location as it is closer to my home. The service is great and the food never fails. Those french fries & the fry sauce  Great spot if you are trying to get eat fresh and healthy as well. A+++"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have the best Gyros and when I tell my kids that we're ordering Greek, they know I'm ordering from Stephanos. I have no need to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"GOOD
I've come to really like this place recently...  It's simple and not overly done...prices and portions are a good value for what u get.

I usually get a pita for during the days and find myself sticking to a plate for dinner cause I can never decide whether I want hummus, rice or salad (plates you get all 3 choices) all so yummy.

I have yet to try a salad but always see ladies in workout clothes eating them from next door... gotta be good if ur meeting a friend for lunch..ha

BAD
Haven't had a bad experience in the 10 to 15 times I've been here. So  I guess no bads here =) 5 stars all around!!

P.s.  I love the mailers buy 2 get 1 free...keep those coming mr. stephano =)"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food, but very pricey!! I had a hankering one night for a gyro.. I looked on Yelp and found this place. The menu was extensive but kinda of expensive, but hey- it was super close to my house. So I called and placed a take out order, I was told ten minutes. We arrived 15 minutes later - wanted a bit of a buffer, but that wasn't enough. My husband waited inside for about 15 minutes. After he noticed our order sitting on the counter, he asked about it and the guy behind the counter was like, oh yeah...yours is ready. Seriously.. ???
So once I got over the price and the poor service, I found the food delicious! The tzatziki sauce was on point, all the veggies were uber fresh, and the portions of meat left nothing to be desired. Hummus and pita bread was flavorful. The spinach pie was ok, but I've had better. Their rice is light and fluffy and meted in my mouth. I want to eat here more, I just need to save some $ first!"}
{"text":"For $20 I got a full dinner and kids kabob dinner. There is no food better than fresh grilled meat, crispy veggies, perfectly flavored rice, Israeli salad and hot pita bread. I'm impressed by how casual it is yet how delicious."}
{"text":"Happened to find this from Yelp.  and find this ! So glad I did .. Food was fresh and the taste was fabulous .. Excellent customer service"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The service was awesome! Highly highly recommend! Thank you very much and we (all 19 of us) will be back the next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food was really good and fresh with huge portions. Can't go wrong with the free baklava on check in! Tried the veggie combo and the 1/2 chicken, both were excellent."}
{"text":"Good all around...not great but definitely good for the price..perfect for quick lunch. Kafta ( kofte) was better than the beef shawarma,although feel free to give any dish a try. None of what ate was below standard.."}
{"text":"I get delivery from here all the time. It's very good!! Just one concern and then I'll Re write my review, if worthy. 
A SMALL, and it's small. (See pictures) of lentil rice is $3 and so is a side kabob???? The rice was dry and even if it was good, which it wasn't, why $3? I think over $3 ridiculous!! I will post my receipt and photos with this for exacts. Otherwise I love it! But I will NOT order that ever again!"}
{"text":"Shout out to my coworkers for making me a Stephano's addict! 

You can't go wrong with anything from this place. Every plate I, my friends, or family has gotten from here have all been equally juicy, tender, and flavorful! Each choice also leaves you feeling SUPER SATISFIED - and since it's all made fresh, there's less guilt afterwards. So glad they have options like the vegetarian rice which isn't cooked in chicken broth to make this place vegan/vegetarian friendly too 

I've ordered Stephano's to go and have had no problems at all with pick ups/orders. I've also been to both this location and the other on the South East end of vegas - this one definitely has more seating, but both have seating both inside and outside with tables you can push together for bigger parties if needed. Both spots also had the friendliest staff and the wait time for food has never exceeded 10-15 minutes.

*The only reason I had to subtract a star was because of the price. Some of the choices are a bit more expensive than I'd like, but still doesn't mean this place isn't totally worth it!"}
{"text":"The thing that separates a restaurant out from the multitude available for my business is service. There is plenty of great tasting food in the valley, and this was no exception. However, the service was simply unacceptable. 

We ordered a meal for 9 people and when picking it up it seemed as though some wasn't present but we were assured that all items were in the bags. After a 15 minute drive back home, an entire meal and side order was missing. 

My wife called to see what could be done to correct the situation and asked if someone could deliver the missing items. The manager  (Stephanie) actually said  (this still shocks me) \"Yes, but that will be a $3 charge.\"  Rather than not only offering to deliver the items for free  (which would go without saying) and likely offering to put in an extra side (a fairly standard practice to make sure the customer understands that you are aware that a mistake is made and want to keep their business), she actually said we would have to pay for delivery. 

My wife opted to go pick it up (15 minute drive) and when she arrived they had completely forgotten who she was and had to search for the bag with the items. 

Mistakes happen, it is how a company deals with it that matters. And Stephanos fell flat on their face and I will not be opening my wallet to them again."}
{"text":"Food looks great and tastes awesome. Love the pita and Hummus. Mmmmm!  Must try if lookin for something new."}
{"text":"Delicious, we ordered the chicken gyro, beef/lamb gyro, tabulli salad and falafels it was delicious. Service was friendly, clean and prompt, it was a pickup order and all was good. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"just moved to the area this month and I cannot believe we have found this gem of a joint!!  haven't gone in to sit down yet but the delivery has been super fast and the food is absolutely amazing. best steak kabob I've had in my entire life."}
{"text":"I LOVE mediterranean food. Stephano's is one of the best things to hit the University area. $2 beers for rebel hours, all day everyday! It's not super greasy (aka better than pizza and burgers for college students). Food is AMAZING and portions are huge. Either leave here feeling stuffed, share a plate with someone, or leave with leftovers!

The fries with sauce and the lamb/beef gyro are my favorite. Be sure to request some extra tzatziki!"}
{"text":"Very good lunch! Everything was fresh. We ordered a chicken shawarma salad, gyro plate, and feta fries. No complaints! Everything was flavorful and just right. Remember to check in to get a free baklava because that was good too! This place came highly recommended and now I also highly recommend it too."}
{"text":"A last minute bite before we returned our rental car at the airport. Gyros and paninis very good, the feta cheese and olives came with a side of pita which was a looooot of food in the end. Israeli salad was pretty good, similar to what I had in Israel but smaller portions. Nice little find! Thanks to Yelp for hooking us up with the free baklava deal too :)"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great food,  but a little overpriced and kinda skimpy on portions.  But I would recommend to anyone who's wants good Greek around this Area."}
{"text":"Very good service and with a smile. 

The rice was delicious. Probably the best rice I have ever had at a Mediterranean spot.  I love garlic paste, and can not eat without it.  They were very gracious to give me 4 sides of it, with no charge.  Thank you!

I had the steak/chicken kabob plate and it was very good.  I also ate the salad that had cucumbers in it, even though I despise cucumbers.  The spices they put on this, make cucumbers taste good, and I thought that was impossible. 

I would return to this location and do recommend it to anyone.  

They have a lunch special that consists of a free drink with purchase. 

Also, if you check in on Yelp, you get a free Baklava. 

They also have Baklava to go; both small and large sizes."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but it was 104 degrees outside and it felt like 100 degrees in the restaurant. There was no air conditioning. A really bad dining experience!"}
{"text":"Great Greek food. Just add Greek fries to the menu and this place would be even more off the shelf food. Haha"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout last week and it was a success.  =)

Food was ready on time and nothing was missing.  I did leave a note on my items not to forget our tzakziti.  The staff who handed me our food did mention she doubled check everything.  

Very happy!"}
{"text":"Great food and hospitality! We will definitely be back. Happy to eat local awesome food! Baklava is just as good as our family's recipe."}
{"text":"It's a cute place, friendly staff. The chicken wrap was good with lots of tomato and garlic taste, chicken was a bit charred but it was fresh. 
The garlic fries are also yummy."}
{"text":"Just visited this restaurant for the first time as we are in Vegas for a conference.  The food came fast and was hot and fresh.  The guy that took our order was so friendly.  Try this place...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Greek food always seems a bit pricey to me, but this place in particular stands out for its lack of bargains.  The food is the same as anywhere else, but I get irritated when there's not a good cheap option, or when you pay full price and leave a bit hungry.  Just meh."}
{"text":"Cool place fast friendly service. Food looks good place is clean. I update after I eat. Okay so I had half of the Falafel my girlfriend had the other half and we both enjoyed the food I'll say it's way better then some others I have tried at some other places. Good job people. We both liked the gyro also. I'll oops sorry honey we will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"The food is a amazing and the customer service is the best I've ever had. I reccently ordered 2 gyros and a steak wrap for delivery. When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing. I promptly called the restaurant and they quickly sent another driver to deliver the missing item from my order. Additionally, they included a second steak wrap, 3 pieces of baklava, and a fully filled rewards card good for a free dinner plate. Service above and beyond that which was required to right a wrong. I liked this place before because the food is so good, but they've just earned a happy customer for life."}
{"text":"I go Stephano's at least once a week. It has never disappointed. The food is not fast, it's fresh. Get a mixed plate, you'll want to try everything. Get hummus to go."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. My shawarma is burnt. Now I can understand a little crisp but it is fully charred and they forgot my pita. The food here is normally good. I usually eat there but had to have it to go and I'm paying the price. Its surprising because take out should be made correct and gone the extra mile for because you dont het the chance to fix it later. But what do I know. For this I will not be eating here again ."}
{"text":"Found this place via yelp while driving around town hungry one night, so glad we found it!

If we weren't so hangry, we would have gotten the jokes from the guy behind the counter much quicker! Friendly and helpful staff.

Ordered the feta fries, hummus, chicken shawarma and lamb/beef gyro.  Food was up very quickly, and was awesome.  These guys definitely know what they're doing! We'll def be back"}
{"text":"This place was cool. I'd be willing to go back except I'd go to the location by campus. I would say that you should definitely order the gyro over the shawarma because it's not really shawarma lol. Actually it tasted nothing like shawarma. Also the falafel is cool but nothing amazing. Probably a box mix. The hommos was bland as hell but I understand that that is what the American audience wants. The fries looked hella good though and the Baba ganoush was good considering it was a little out of the ordinary. 
If I sound critical it's because I am lol. I'm Lebanese so I know what I'm looking for. I would come back here to try their gyro bc I'm no doubt guessing that the owners are Greek and not Arabs (I had thought they might be arab bc of the \"shawarma\" spit) so their gyro is probably good lol. 
Try it for yourself though!"}
{"text":"Excellent genuine Mediterranean food. We had just finished at the water park and were starving. Generous portion sizes, decent prices, something for everyone in the family from ages 4+. Order at the counter and food is delivered to your table. Wish there was one of these at home."}
{"text":"Dolmahs, magic words, \"My grandmother makes them.\" Oooooh yeah..."}
{"text":"We ordered from here again the other night and it was amazing as usual!

I got the gyro plate and my husband got the filet mignon skewer plate with tabbouleh and falafel on the side with 3 extra pitas. We fed our family of four and had three leftover meals from this.

We have nothing but positive things to say about the service, the food and the prices. If you're thinking about giving them a try please do because you definitely won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly but the order took a while (I ordered lamb shank).  There was only one other customer that came in during the time I was waiting for my order.  The dining area was clean and well decorated.  The food was good but I've had better lamb cuisine at similar Greek/Mediterranean grills.  It's not near my house so I will more than likely not return.  It's okay, but not a favorite for me.  There were coupons available that I used for my order."}
{"text":"Pretty good selection, good taste and fun seating arrangements 
Some of the items taste fresh while some taste store bought though; but still, it's not a bad place for some good Mediterranean eats"}
{"text":"I loooove this restaurant, and this location in particular. The patio is dog-friendly so my dog and I come here and I get some work done on my laptop (they have wifi). The food is awesome, and the servers are very friendly. I've had their Spanakopita plate, Tzatziki dip with really good pita bread and their Baklava. Everything is really tasty."}
{"text":"Anyone, and I do mean \"anyone\", can enjoy the dishes served here - carnivore, vegetarian, etc. Salads are ample, so guys, good for watching the waistline. I've devoured about a dozen different dishes over the past couple of years, so it's hard to pick a dud. Don't forget to check in with Yelp and get a free baklava. Yummie!"}
{"text":"Just had their gyro salad and baklava. Both are so delicious.  I love when the salads are served with a Greek dressing and the tzatziki."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place based on recommendations from Yelp. I wanna start off by saying that the food is good, I won't argue with that but you know what there are plenty of other places in Vegas who serves good Greek food as well as good customer service. 

I wanted to try the Moussaka based on the recommendation from another Yelper, they told me they were out something about the oven out of order. Then I checked in on Yelp and the offer is free baklava. They were out of baklava too. I decided to order the Shrimp Kabab. 35 minutes later we were still waiting for our food. There were only 4 table occupied in the whole place. My husband finally checked on them and he was told that they are now making it because they ran out of rice. The food finally came out a minute later.

They have good food but that was a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I was running around town for about a month looking for some good beef shawarma (seems like many other places just have chicken). And I found some with beef but I was not impressed. 

This is the first place I've been to that I've actually came back to. Their beef shawarma reminds me of the ones my family used to get in Philippines (yeah, that's a little weird.. Philippines for shawarma?!). It's so good! Their fries are also delicious. They're light and fluffy on the inside and crispy and flaky on the outside. And whatever they use to season them just makes it more yummy.

The cashier is also very nice. It's always the same guy every time I come in. 

Oh and it's such a plus that they have blue powerade for one of their fountain drinks, which surprisingly has more flavor than the ones you get at the stores."}
{"text":"Gyros are bomb. Prob the best in town. Service is good too. I recommend to everyone. Oh and the fries. Yummy"}
{"text":"For a quick service Mediterranean restaurant, Stephano's does fine. The menu is a good mix of kebab plates, handhelds, and salads. You can order \"low carb\" meals which omit rice, hummus, or pita bread.  You can also opt for \"double protein\" which I don't recommend. The double protein option is expensive. While it's low carb, it is NOT low calorie. You're better off ordering the standard meal.

Overall, service was good. Indoor seating is ample. The outdoor seating area is nice too. Outside there is a covered picnic type area with a patio cover and shrubbery shielding you from the roadway.

The weekday lunch hour can be busy, but the kitchen is pretty quick. You shouldn't have trouble ordering and receiving your food in a reasonable time period."}
{"text":"I've been to Stephano's twice now.  The first time, I got the gyro meal, which comes with a LOT of food.  I didn't finish the French fries, the pita bread, or the hummus.  The second time, I had the gyro and French fries.  Overall, I'd say this review is maybe a 3.5 stars.  I can't go up to 4, but it certainly is better than 3.  Solid fries (thin and crispy), and good sauce.

My main issue that prevents me from bumping Stephano's up to 4 stars is the grilling of the gyro meat.  Not every place does this, and in some bites, it's FANTASTIC.  I love that flame kissed taste.  But, in a lot of places, really more often that not, it was overly cooked on the grill.  This results in a black and \"charcoaly\" taste and mouth feel.  It was these bites that I did not care for, and each time I had a lot of these bites.  

The fry sauce has a nice tang to it, it's not just ketchup and mayo mixed.  It's probably the best fry sauce I've had.  I also like the special during lunch wherein they give you a free drink if you order a sandwich and side.  I've taken advantage of this both times I ate at Stephano's.  

The check in offer is a small piece of baklava, which was fantastic.  It was the perfect size to finish the meal, and was very moist and sweet.  It was a great representation of baklava.

Overall, I understand why this place is so popular.  The restaurant is clean and comfortable and service is friendly and prompt.  But, the grilling is too aggressive for me and what should be a benefit ends up overwhelming the entire meal."}
{"text":"One of the great med place.. Don't forget to claim your baklava it's free by checking in.. Space is ample so not to bad at all... Try out the place.. I love it.."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food if I lived here I'd be there all day everyday. Thanks for the amazing food guys!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Going back to eating yummy.

This is one of my favorite stops when making my way up to sky country.

I can't go by Vegas without stopping in. 

It's like walking into my Nana's kitchen"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bite because the reviews looked promising and I wanted to try a new spot. I have to say, I wasn't impressed. The tzatziki on the beef and lamb gyro wrap was flavorless and runny. I'm not sure if the meat is mixed or cut from separate slabs but some parts were bland and some were salty. I also had 2 bites that contained an odd substance. I suppose it could've been cartilage but I couldn't even chew through it. Gross."}
{"text":"Came here a few months back with my friend who recommended the filet mignon kebab... Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This spot is right by my house, taking over Khoury's previous location. I was here yesterday around 7:30pm. The person that took my order was very nice and cool, as was the other workers I interacted with. I ordered a number 8 with an extra chicken skewer. Everything was good, and I really liked the garlic sauce because it was very garlicy. The reason for the 3 stars is the presentation of the food compared to the price. With tip and everything for one person came to almost $25 (no drink), but the presentation of the food looked like a low end, cheap $7 food plate. For that price at other middle eastern/Mediterranean restaurants, you get a lot more rice, meat, and metal utensils AND drink. I MIGHT be back if it's last resort and I don't want to drive far, but overall good experience."}
{"text":"Love the fries and chicken schwarma bowl. Food is always fresh.  Remodel of the seating area looks good!"}
{"text":"Been to this location a couple times now and it is delicious! Food has been consistent and fresh! I love the gyro fries. You get a good amount of food for the cost."}
{"text":"I was brought to this place by my colleagues for an early dinner. I've never been a fan of Mediterranean food but I couldn't decline my coworkers' invitation. Let me say, it was truly great. My order consisted of a shrimp and filet mignon skewers. I'm not huge on red meat, therefore I wasn't a big fan of the filet mignon but the rest of the dish was delicious! My only real concern was the baklava. It tasted wonderful, therefore I purchase a dozen to take home. When I bit into a piece of baklava at home, I felt as though I chipped my molar. I'm not sure what it was but it left a mad taste in my mouth (not literally of course). Overall, still a good place to check out. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Really good customer service and the place is really clean but may I suggest lowering the price here. I felt like the Baklava is overpriced because they charge too much for such a small portion. Don't get me wrong it's fantastic but if you want more college students like me to eat here adjustments needs to be made. Other than that it was so delicious here."}
{"text":"We tried this place out since the other Greek restaurants around us were closed for the day. We ordered several gyro salad plates. However, I had a bad stomachache after eating the gyro. Additionally, the leftovers smelled horrible. If you like to eat aged funky-smelling meat then you must eat here....and don't forget the stomachache afterwards!"}
{"text":"This is a review for the VEGAN yelpers out there:
They're quite nice here. To my memory, they have exactly two vegan-friendly dishes, as long as you omit the yogurt and the dolmas (the dolmas are cooked with chicken broth, according to the employee). 
Personally, I feel like I can get food just as good or better for a much better price. Not bad though!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch this weekend and very impressed.  Had the traditional gyro and my friend had the chicken skewers and a veggie skewer.  The meats were incredibly tasty and it was reasonably priced. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Service was great and very fast. The place has a very clean, modern vibe to it. The menu is huge and the food is great! So far I have had the chicken Shwarma, moussaka and veggie pita. The feta fries look amazing. I will be trying them next time."}
{"text":"I started eating this recently, wish I knew about it earlier. Being a student I am pressed for time and Stephano's is close and convenient.  Their prices are reasonable and being a student gets you a free drink. I love their spinach pie and their grape leaves. 

The decor of the restaurant is beautiful, I love the colors inside, very warm and welcoming. Stephano's would be a great place to go to at night for some drinks but I have yet to make that trip. 

Their service is great, Nick one of the employees and future owner I presume is great and always friendly. My first time he recommended some plates for me and rewarded my loyalty recently with some free rice pudding which was delicious."}
{"text":"I've made it to Stephano's at least a couple of times a month for the past year. They provide a consistently good meal at a reasonable price. I really enjoy the lamb/beef gyro plate. Their pita is always warm, the rice is delicious, the meat, excellent and the hummus is great as well. 

I also sometimes get the feta fries which can take a little longer to prepare but are amazing if you enjoy mozzarella, feta and french fries! They're fries sauce is also very good and I enjoy dipping my gyro meat in it as well!

I've also had their pita wraps, greek salad, and baklava, which are all outstanding and overall make up my go-to Greek restaurant in the valley."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Greek food last year by my bf. He took me here :) great choice. I used to not like hummus and I really didn't try many foods if I hadn't eaten them before. I was super picky but I wanna say it was great places like this that made me brave enough to give other foods a try :)

Stephanos is absolutely the best Greek food restaurant in town. It has a lot of dishes to choose from and if you check in you get free dessert :)"}
{"text":"Stephano's Gyros is a hidden little gem with bold flavorful Mediterranean food. Ordered the gyro which came with a good sized scoop of hummus and veggie salad (there's a name for it, but I'm too busy eating it to find out lol) and spinach pie.

Came here passing by with my prego wife. Anyone that has experienced pregnancy knows the dire situation of tastes constintly changing. So I will part ways with this cafe knowing full well that we will be returning."}
{"text":"Stephano's Gyro's is right next to my house, and so we go all the time for take out.  Very fresh and tasty food, and can't beat the price.  The staff are friendly, and would recommend to anyone who likes Greek food!"}
{"text":"Stephanos has my favorite Gyro in town hands down! They char the meat which makes them stand apart from other Greek and gyro places. The warm bread with the charred meat and tzatziki sauce make for an awesome party in your mouth. My fiancé ordered the gyro but that didn't stop me from trying it ;) lol. I ordered a kofta shawarma combo plate which comes with pita, hummus, tomato cucumber salad, and rice. Combo plates come with all those sides just choose your protein. The shawarma was just chicken. Not flavorful and juicy like I had imagined. I wasn't aware until reading a review that a garlic sauce that comes atop the shawarma but no trace or sign of it at all. The beef kofta was juicy and delicious. Again I love anything that's been on a grill or has grilled flavor. I've had it at other places and I seem to always enjoy it. You get more bang for your buck on a combo plate because with the pita can basically make your own gyro and enjoy the rest of the sides with it. You also have plenty of leftovers with a combo plate. I now have a new lunch spot close to work just make sure to remember to make sure your baklava came with your order. It's free with yelp check in but they forgot to give it to me and I was in such a rush to get back to work that I forgot as well. Oh well next time I guess."}
{"text":"I really love Greek food.  I ordered my food, and no drink, I usally don't by soda's only if they have alcohol in it! But they offered me a free soda, while I waited.  But I chose not to.  the service is great, I had to try a Falafle, because I follow someone on youtub, he eats them all the time.  So I had to check it out.  The fries at Greek food places are always amazing.  I liked the wrap.....But without the Falafle.  lol  It was different, just not for me.  But I love Stephano's."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food every time. Gyro meat is amazing and the chicken kebab is great as well. Must try their feta fry's with their fry sauce. Great to go and eat or order and have it delivered. We eat here many times each month. And I forgot to mention how good the rice is as well."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in town. I usually end up getting the shrimp platter because it is SO GOOD, but sometimes I branch out. Their gyros are good and I just tried the filet mignon bowl tonight, which was awesome. Everything is always fresh and delicious. I love their Greek salad and their rice is bomb. I've done take-out, eat in, and even catering and I've never not been satisfied. The atmosphere in this location is a little more updated than the Maryland location, and has a kind of hipster/industrial feel to it. Employees are always very nice at both locations. The Maryland location has discounts for UNLV students, but has weird hours. I definitely recommend Stephano's!"}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of Mediterranean places around this area so I was sad on missing out on Khoury's but was quickly elated when Stephano's took over.

I first visited the week they opened and was not disappointed, portions are huge and flavors are as good as can be expected from a casual, somewhat fast food ish kinda place. Got the combo platter with Chicken shawarma and gyro. It comes with Hummus, Israeli salad and pita bread. Along with that are 3 different types of sauces: garlic, tahini and tzatziki. On a different occasion I tried their Chicken kebabs and that I enjoyed as well. My kids thoroughly enjoy their seasoned fries especially when dipped in their secret fry sauce. So addicting!

Most recently though, I wasn't quite satisfied with my order. I work close by so I decided to place a phone order for pick up. Chicken shawarma plate wasn't as good as I remembered and the sides were just ok. Ate half and threw away the rest. They have a pretty large menu though so I might try something else next time.

For dessert I've only had their baklava. It's not the best but it appeases any cravings. Don't forget to check in to get a free one! This past visit I saw grilled pita with Nutella as their newest offering, of course that caught my attention. I'd have to try that!"}
{"text":"The best greek/ mediterrenean resto in Vegas!!! Love their garlic sauce! Try them and you'll thank me after."}
{"text":"Excellent.. Right across the street from UNLV..show your student I.D.  free drink. We ordered the gyro with feta cheese combo and a spinach pie. The meat in the gyro was thick cut and very tasty.. The spinach pie appetizer is perfect as a meal itself..you get 2 large pieces. Its full of spinach,feta cheese, fillo and toped with sesame seeds. The meal was perfect. I will return again. Also on November 17th, its national baklava day..stop by and get a free piece while supplies last.."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken kabob plate for pick-up and was pleasantly surprised when I drove up to the establishment. It had a beautiful patio with lights draping the outside and when I walked in, it matched the atmosphere perfectly. They were a bit busy when I walked in and it didn't seem very organized when it came to the cashiers but it was my first time so I didn't know where to get in line. I was promptly helped and when I got home to open my plate it was bursting with the perfect combinations of flavor that complimented one another. I've been trying to find some good Mediterranean food in Las Vegas because I'm originally from LA and nothing in Las Vegas seemed to compete with what I'm used to. I was so happy to find this place! I will definitely be back and tell all my friends about this gem."}
{"text":"I had the chicken shawarma pita. The grilled chicken was moist. It was $7 plus tax. Next time I will try the chicken shawarma plate."}
{"text":"We are regulars. At least 1 to 2 times a week. Don't know what is going on but customer service and time management have been going down hill the last month. Need to take care of your customers!"}
{"text":"Love the food!! I can't get enough. I wish the portions were a little bit bigger especially for the price. But still a very good go-to sit down meal."}
{"text":"Me and the rest of the crew in the pharmacy always order here for delivery. It's always in a timely manner and fast.

The food is super good. We love the gyro bowl and spinach pie! 

Last time we ordered for delivery though, they ended up delivering the wrong order. But I just called back and they were able to rectify by redelivering a whole new order. They even told us to keep the incorrect one. 

Def a place you want to order from especially if you want good food and delivered fast! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Definitely our favorite Mediterranean place in the south Vegas/Henderson area.  You can't go wrong with the chicken or filet kebobs.  Always best to dine in to take advantage of the warm pita.  The staff is also super friendly and very accommodating if you want to switch some things up with your order.  Too bad we don't live a little closer..."}
{"text":"This place has a nice décor, I love the darker calming color scheme. It is a cute place for lunch with friends and even a casual date.
I got a whole mess of food to bring back to a family lunch when I was in the area. It came to about 90 bucks.
 What I liked right away is there are low carb options so that is great for Atkins and diabetics, dieters etc. Always nice to have an option. They even have a large meat platter you can get. So I ordered that, no one liked the smaller bits of meat, I forget what it was called... but the other pieces were nice.  ( I decided to just try out a whole mess of different items, great way to find out which are your favorites). 
The desserts looked tiny, as in bite size. They were cheap too. So good if you just want a bite but are watching your waistline too.
 To us the Salad was very grassy tasting and not very crisp, but that is just about personal choice in lettuce preference. It might be the ideal salad for someone who actually wants some greens and not ice burg lettuce.
 The rice was just rice, I wasn't disappointed or impressed. The casserole dishes needed some help. They were small for the price with way too much cheese.
The staff were fine, I got helped to the car with the bags. 
 Considering the choices on Eastern Ave, this is a better bet than most,  but if I really want amazing Greek food I'll keep going to my favorite the Great Greek on Warm Springs.
 So this is a good review, the place is mentionable. One just needs to know a little bit about the menu to work it to your best advantage and preferences."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I were trying to figure out where to go for lunch. All of us were extremely hungry, and wanted some tasty food around the UNLV campus. One of my co-workers suggested Stephano's so I decided to go and try it out. Upon entering I saw it was pretty busy, so if you plan on getting lunch there around 11-12, be prepared for a line.

For $10 I got half a chicken, rice, Israeli salad, hummus, and pita bread. All of it was so filling and so satisfying. The chicken had a ton of flavor and hints of lemon. The rice was my favorite part of the meal. It had a unique flavor to it and even though I was full, I couldn't stop eating. 

Be sure you check in if you have a yelp account! Upon check-in, you'll receive a free baklava with any purchase of $5 or more! Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This is my first review, so be kind. :-P

I have eaten at Stephano's many times throughout my life as a student at UNLV, and what a long time that has been... (hell, I remember when this place was called the Daily Chicken). It has remained a consistently good lunch venue especially if you are craving something something different from the typical lunch staples around the university (namely, Chipotle, Cafe Rio, Einstein Bagels and others) at a very reasonable price. On top of this it has a pleasant ambiance making it a great place to relax and talk after a filling lunch.  

I typically get the gyro combo which comes with a gyro, fries, and a soda. I have not tried many other things on the menu, but as I usually go with friends and they seem pretty satisfied with their selections, I can say that there are at least some other good choices available. (There is a student special similar in price to the gyro combo but is instead a bowl with meat, rice, and vegetables). 

The amount of food for the price, which comes to under $9 for this particular meal, is very good and the food is received fairly promptly. The gyro has gyro meat (beef and lamb), tomatoes, onions, and tzatziki sauce all in good proportions. The fries are crispy and go well with the gyro. Overall the meal is a great deal and quite delicious.

Of course there are better Mediterranean places in Las Vegas, both near and far from the university, but for the price and convenience, this is definitely a great place to eat at! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The best gyro shop in town!  They have recently renovated their space and it is brighter and more modern looking.  A great improvement.  The food is freshly prepared to order, and quickly completed.

Highly recommend going for their gyros!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best Mediterranean fast food restaurants I've been to.  I ordered the 1/4 Flame Grilled Chicken that came with white or dark chicken meat served on a bed of rice and side of garlic sauce.  the price was decent ($8.35) plus tax.  It was the best chicken I've had in a long time.  

The atmosphere was laid back and relaxed.  I loved the fact their menus that hang above the cashier was big and very legible.  It was very clean inside and even had a hookah lounge towards the back.  The decorations were colorful and the set up was almost like a food court setting with all the chairs and tables spread out with a good amount of space.  I was also  amazed by how nice the cashier was and helpful too. 

Only thing I don't like was the rice.  It tasted old and off.  Despite that, I would go back again for the chicken, salad, and hummus.  Mmmm... hummus."}
{"text":"First time. Enjoyed the food. Fairly priced. Nice service. Ambiance is nothing special. I will definitely come bac"}
{"text":"This our first time here and we loved their food.  Always fresh veggies and pita breads. I think this gonna be my go to place for gyro wrap since we live near here.  We live near this place and we never gave it a chance to try it.  But we're glad we did since my kids actually ate their food.  \"Thats the first\" .  I'm glad we did try this place.  Plus their hummus is the bomb yes yes!"}
{"text":"Come here that is for sure. If you like Greek food you will enjoy this. Prices are fair and the amount you get is huge. Everything is fresh and tasty. Staff is nice and quick. Didn't had the chance to try the baklava but there is always next time :)"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 party platters off the catering menu for a party.  The food was delivered hot and on time.  The size was perfect and a great variety.   Everyone loved the food and we will definitely be ordering again in the future."}
{"text":"Great value on the lunch special plates. I tried the Beef & Lamb Gyro plate and it was huge and delicious! I'll be back soon..."}
{"text":"Great gyros at a great price. Ask for the garlic sauce, you'll be happy you did. Oh, and don't forget to pick up some baklava."}
{"text":"I can't rave enough about this place. We are from Los Angeles and decided to do local eateries, this place didn't fail. Top notch flavor"}
{"text":"The Falafel wrap was delicious. Falafel cooked just right. Not mushy and not hard as a rock dry. 

Staff friendly. 

Our order was accidentally given to someone else so we waited a little longer but it was so yummy.  Then when we were almost done the nice lady brought baklava which was also super yummy. 

We will definitely return. 

Bathroom clean. Place clean and neat."}
{"text":"I'm born and raised in Greece. So this is my honest review. I got the gyro sandwich combo. Gyro was amazing, so happy they don't cheapen it with Lettuce, meat was very good. Feta fries are hard to rate because they came out barely warm. I'll have to try them again. Baklava was very good and they had my favorite tropical tea so they get bonus points. Overall would come here again. This is the second Greek place in town that I would revisit.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Falafel success! Add this to your list of need to try bean balls of goodness because not only are they delicious, you can get them served with wheat pita! Suh-wheat! When the lady asked me if I wanted wheat pita, I bet my eyes sparkled with joy. This whole grain bonus warrants an entire star to itself.

The falafel plate is served with delicious sides of Israeli salad, hummus and some additional leafy greens. I loved it all, and even though I don't have a sweet tooth, the free baklava check in offer made me happy. Quite possible the sweetest check in offer I have had the honor of redeeming. 

The spot is a casual, but clean and comfortable. I didn't adore the iced tea, but it is freshly brewed. I am still trying to find a spot that serves up iced tea with an Earl Grey kick. 

To sum it up: I definitely consider it worth a journey across town the next time a falafel craving hits."}
{"text":"First time we have been here this is a cool little place the food was amazing and all the people were friendly. There humas was good. Had a piece of baklava for desert tasted good a little doughy but good. If you like Greek check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this restaurant only has a 4 star!!! Most definitely a 5 star. The food and service was excellent, the rice is out of this world. We ordered chicken kabob and kofta, I am a great cook from Egypt and he liked their kofta better !! I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"I loved this and so did my very picky husband.  Near our friends' house so we decided on Greek instead of some lame pizza.  I had the chicken schwerma and it was really good as was the hummus, pita, cucumber salad and sauces.  The star for me other than the chicken was the rice.  We all thought it was much better than it really should have been for looking plain.  My hubby had the filet or sirloin kabob (don't have a menu in front of me), and he loved it as well.  Definitely a do-over!"}
{"text":"Love this place...everything is fresh.  Staff friendly, clean place.  Lots of healthy choices.  My fave is the shrimp and chicken kabobs ;D they're hummus is the bomb as well and their wheat pita is yummers"}
{"text":"Definitely going back. Want to try it for dinner with cocktails ;). Took my Indian friend there and was a little worried. He likes food spicy. But he loved it! Ate my hummus too. The food was very flavorful and the portions were generous.
I had the Souvlaki and my friend had the Beef & Lamb Gyro. Prices were good. I do want to go back and try the Moussaka and Baklava."}
{"text":"One of the best Gyros in town and their fries are awesome.!
A really good menu and the people are always friendly.!"}
{"text":"Travelling from Hawaii, I read good things about this place and also got a good deal on it. Although Vegas had just been hit by the 'North Winds' and temperatures dropped to 50 degrees with 30 mph winds, I wanted to get my Greek fix and visit neighboring UNLV. I had my menu items picked out weeks in advance, so I stepped up and ordered.

Hummus side- 3 1/2-stars- The hummus as clean, basic and creamy. Obviously, you get a nice layer of olive oil on top. This comes with a steaming back of pita bread, wrapped warm and tight. I'd consider this a good compliment to any dish. But, if you're ordering a plate with hummus or been-there-done-that, I'd recommend baba ganoush as another option.

Feta with Olives side- 4-stars- A beautiful, briny dish also served with it's own batch of pita bread. (I hear the wheat pita is the best, as one man exclaimed.) The huge, purplish Kalamata olives are so sweet and salty, with very small seeds. It was just a satisfaction biting into these. The feta was also brisk and briny. It was almost too much salt for one dish, but eating them with a pita helped to spread the distinct flavors out a little.

Falafel Plate- 4-stars- Served with five falafels, the spices hit you immediately. The falafel were a little drier, yet also crispier than I've been accustomed to. There is a light coating of tzatziki to add some moisture. The Israeli salad is a mixture of cucumber, tomato, onion, and cilantro almost like a salsa. Amazingly, the flavor and freshness reminded me of a lomi lomi in Hawaii (without the seafood obviously). My suggestion, as you also get pitas with this plate--add the salad into the pita, then pack on some hummus to keep all the loose pieces together. Throw on the falafel last, then enjoy the mixture of flavors as they hit your taste-buds. The plate is huge, and all three was more than enough to stuff me beyond capacity. Yet, I didn't feel weighed down, which is a good thing. Healthy and delicious!

Atmosphere- The set-up is very open and casual, with light music playing in the background. Check out the seats in the rear of the restaurant if you want a more intimate feel while you're eating--with pillows, etc. rather than wooden seats. The decorations are light, but there is a nice bookshelf dedicated to the beers they carry. Wi-fi is also available, yet secured, so I guess you gotta ask for the password--there was no info on the receipt nor the buzzer they give you with your order. I did find it amusing, there was sriracha sauce available as a hot sauce. I don't know if it's made it all the way to Greece, or the local clientele just loves it, but sriracha is definitely a good, comforting sign of discriminating tastes.

Service- Service is very casual and friendly. You do get a buzzer when your order is ready, and it's picked up on the side window away from where you make your order. Beyond this, you don't really speak to the servers.

Conclusion- Definitely a quiet, humble place, just a hop-skip-and-a-run across the street from UNLV. It seems to attract both student and staff, especially with the variety of options between beer and wi-fi and sriracha (still amazed to see this sauce there). It does lack some excitement and pizzazz, but I'm sure that comes in often enough from the front doors."}
{"text":"I try to stop here for lunch everytime I'm in henderson. Love their chicken shawarma and gyro wraps... Very generous servings and the service is always great."}
{"text":"Definitely A-OK! Got a salad and shared a half chicken plate. Chicken was tender and flavorful (thanks for keeping it real with the skin on folks!!!) salad was fresh but it had a ton of feta dumped on top and the greens were in huge pieces and kinda hard to eat. Other than those minor criticisms this is a good place to grab some yummy Mediterranean grub."}
{"text":"Wow. Simply wow. Coming from New York this is best kabob place I've found in Las Vegas. Every time has been superb! I always get the chicken kabob plate or the chicken kabob rice bowl. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"I tried the gyros sandwich combo meal which comes with fries and a drink. Not a bad deal at $10.25 after tax.

The gyros meat was good and they give a good portion of it on the sandwich. They have the real deal carved off the spit here- no pre packaged frozen slices. The rest of the sandwich fixings were fine. They serve it with plenty of sliced onions and tomatoes. The tzatziki sauce was the real deal too- no ranch dressing like some places put on their gyros thank goodness. The only downside was they served it on a pita that was soggy on one side. Looked like they toasted it on the inside but the outside was soggy and stuck to the foil wrap and my fingers. 

The fries were hot and crispy but I did not like them. They serve the kind of fries that have some kind of crispy coating on them that give the fries sort of a light breaded texture, not just cut potatoes. 

I ordered to go, but while I was waiting I noted the restaurant is small, but nice. Clean and new with a few tables and a couple of TV's on the walls.

The service is where you order at the register then you get your own soft drink. They also have a nice selection of bottled beers. Your meal is brought out to your table by an employee when it is ready. 

I'll probably go back for a gyros sandwich once in a while as it was above average but I'll pass on the fries."}
{"text":"AMAZZINGG! I've been going there for years and every experience has been DELICIOUS. I love how I can always walk in there expecting to have a great meal. My favorite would have to be the chicken gyro. I HAVE to get a side of seasoned french fries (BEST fries) and Baba Ganoush every time I go. The Baklava is heaven on Earth... I always try to save room for some. It's inexpensive and you get a lot of food. Good music and calm atmosphere. My friends and I can always count on Stephano's after a long day at school. Kick back, eat some tasty food, and order a refreshing beer. I can't wait to go there for lunch tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"I had Beef Shawerma plate which included hummus, Israeli salad and pita bread. Super delicious the portion in my opinion is pretty big. (I couldn't finish) nice atmosphere, employees are friendly."}
{"text":"I usually would give this place 5 stars. However I called in an order. Came and picked it up got home and it wasn't even close to my order. Tried to call was on hold for 5 min before I was answered. Came back for my order and return food and had to wait another 20 min for it. Not to mention this is the second time this has happened. Very disappointed 


Update: got home with the right meal. Got a text from the store with a gift card covering the meal and my next meal! Kudos to stephanos!  Thankfully because I really like the food! And the guy at the counter is always so incredibly nice!!"}
{"text":"I left hungry.  I just didn't like the garlic sauce.  I ordered the half flame grilled chicken with garlic sauce, rice, Israeli salad, and pita bread.  The chicken was tender, but tasted bland.  I tried eating it with the garlic sauce, but the garlic sauce tasted horrible!  I've had way better.  It just ruined the whole dish."}
{"text":"My friend and I Placed an order for delivery, the guy on the phone said 30 to 45 min, so since we were watching Sunday night football and it was half way through the first quarter we figured the food would be here well before half time, we'll an hour goes by and it's almost half time and no food yet, so we called to check the status and the guy on the phone rudely says that they jus yg started cooking it and the delivery driver will be their soon, so we decided to give them till the beginning of the third quarter, so another 20 min pass by and at this point we were starving and weren't going to wait much longer so we called again to see what's going on and a lady answered this time and says it's about to go out. At this point they are already 30 to 45 min later than they said they would deliver, so we decided to cancel our order and just go to a local bar, the reason as to why they don't even deserve a star is the rude customer service and the fact they have our phone number and did not decide to call us and tell us they were running late l, instead we called twice well after the estimated delivery time and still did nothing to provid customer service or apologize for being so late, I used to eat here atleast 2 to 3 times a month, but after this I will not even consider them again"}
{"text":"The Falafel Wrap was absolutely delish, as were the piping hot fries that came with it. I substituted the sauce that was supposed to come with the wrap for tzatziki sauce (because I can't get enough of that stuff!). Unfortunately, I was in a rush so I didn't have the pleasure of gorging myself with the hefty portions I was served. :(

There wasn't really a \"Mediterranean\" vibe to the restaurant- I would describe it as University friendly though. There was plenty of seating and random fact: Stephano's carries Rooster hot sauce at their condiment station! Yes!

My combo included the wrap, fries, and a drink for around $10.75, which I guess is average price wise for Mediterranean food. The wait time was minimal and the food has my seal of approval. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food! The salad was very tasty and refreshing they hummus was delicious as well. The only gripe I have is the pita bread was a bit dry. They have more vegan option that other Mediterranean places that I have been too. The restaurant itself was very clean and comfortable. Overall not bad I would probably go back."}
{"text":"Let me first commend them on their social media presence. They began following me on Twitter and I did not know that they even existed. Was in the area one day and recognized the signage. I know it was formerly a very popular Mediterranean restaurant that I loved. 

Stephano's had more of a fast food feel, but with excellent customer service. The owner gave me a free baklava from my Yelp check in and a free beverage just because. Some places don't even want to give you a courtesy cup of water these days, but he was very generous. 

I ordered a falafel sandwich and it was good. Someone was just a little heavy handed with the hummus. Don't get me wrong because I love me some hummus, but it was getting all over the place. 

Because I enjoyed the warmth of the place and the friendliness of the staff, I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"The food here is super yummy and healthy when you're on the go! The staff is fun and helpful! Plus it's the best Baba Ghanoush around!!!!! Make sure you check in for a free Baklava."}
{"text":"Love the eclectic decor. The food was tasty and well seasoned. I preferred the beef bowl and it came with rice pilaf, Israeli salad and pita bread with tatziki sauce. My man ordered the beef gyro combo, and it came with a drink and French fries. French fries was so crispy and good. The food here was really good.

We checked in on Yelp and got free baklava. They topped it with fresh pistachios."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  I could eat here every day.  Delicious flavors.  Big portions.  Highly recommended.  Love the chicken bowl with pita and special yogurt sauce."}
{"text":"For the price it's a great deal. Even the portion sizes are huge! I really enjoyed this place and wil return. The fries are a must and the cemployees were really nice. After we were done with our meal they gave us a small sampling of two of their desserts. Will return again.

PROS: Everything
CONS: There should be one in Summerlin"}
{"text":"Used to be my go-to place.
I will not pay $17 for a falafel salad and soda anymore sorry.
Thank you, I wont come again."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is for real. The filet mignon kebab is off the chart out of this world. If I had to pick a menu for my last meal their rice and their filet mignon kebab would be on the menu.   Unfortunately I am moving from Las Vegas to Myrtle Beach South Carolina and it breaks my heart that I have to say goodbye to this restaurant. When I do come back to visit my first stop in Las Vegas will be here.

If you like Mediterranean this is A must. If you live in the neighborhood this is a must!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. I dine there minimum 2 times a week. Excellent service all the time and the environment is very warm and welcoming. Their food is excellent."}
{"text":"everything is super legit here.  half chicken plate tastes amazing and is unbelievable value.  They do not skimp on small things like humus and garlic butter as it comes with the dish.  highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We did a takeout order from Postmates and they messed up royally. We called Stephano's, and not only did they apologize for the delivery service, but they made good on the mistake. All I can Ask for is that a company recognizes when they can do better. I'm so glad that they did, because the food, even to go, was amazing. We had the grape leaves which fresh, and a delicious Greek salad that didn't seem soggy by the time it was delivered. The beef Shawarma sandwich was tender,  and didn't have all the fat most places do. Finally, the pita and onions were fresh! I'm so glad that we asked for the turnips on the side,  because that made the meal! Thank you to my helper on the phone tonight, you heard and delivered!"}
{"text":"Really good chicken schawarma wrap! Close to work and good for working later nights! Though, the pita bread I got with my side of hummus was store bought, It'd be great if they were homemade!"}
{"text":"I love the wheat pita and Tzaziki , and the gyro with feta is amazing. My friend got the chicken kabob salad and it was great. I love the hummus , and the gyro salad. Cannot go wrong here, it's all delicious !!"}
{"text":"Tried this place today from our office. 

The menu seems to have a lot of interesting choices that i would love to try. 

I ordered the Beef and Lamb gyro wrap with a side of fries with their special fry sauce.  The gyro was good, I'm used to having them slightly larger but the flavor was great no complaints. I have no idea what that tangy fry sauce is but it's great make sure you have it.

The only thing that kept them from getting a full five stars was their super rude delivery driver.
The restaurant charges a $3 delivery charge and I tipped the driver an additional $2. Being that my order was only $10 adding an additional $5 was more than generous. However the driver didn't see it that way and made sure my entire office including our clients heard his displeasure.

Way unprofessional and that would stop our office from ordering from them again ever."}
{"text":"Got the Greek salad and was super impressed. Huge portions and great service. Loved it!"}
{"text":"My first time eating Greek food and it was pretty good.  Some of the flavors were different from what I'm use to and couldn't figure out what it was. But the new and different flavors and textures was exciting for my taste buds.    The baklava is to die for.  Not to sweet but just right."}
{"text":"I'm vegetarian so I really like their falafel wrap.  Ambience and decor is nice too, especially for lunchtime.  I'm  not the biggest fan of the babaganush, and the pita bread is just okay.  I like their fries, particularly with feta, and the tangy dipping sauce they provide.  I appreciate that the menu is easy to read and has lots of options."}
{"text":"Very consistent, tasty, and healthy. I come here as often as possible and order the rice bowl with choice of meat and Israeli salad"}
{"text":"A Little hard to find, but i blame that on my GPS unit. I sampled some fares at the 89xxx Exhibition at UNLV. I was hungry and wanted something different. Upon Entering its laid out nicely. Great seating area. 3 flat screen Tvs. Comfy wide chairs and normal wooden chairs. FREE WIFI. Free baklava when you check in. AWESOME. You can see meat rotating on spits behind the counter. And they hand you a buzzer that lights and vibrates when your food is ready. 

Music is playing loud enough to here but soft enough you can hold a conversation without yelling. They also serve Alcohol. Mmm Yummy. I had the Gyro Plate. Its Beef and Lamb on Pita. Comes with a extra pita to dip in Hummus and israeli salad. Your pita can come in White or Wheat i like the option because somedays I love wheat bread. The Beef and Lamb was perfectly cooked and had a smoky flavor and spices i never experienced before. They give enough tzatiki sauce. The vegetables on the gyro are nice and fresh. 

The hummus had the right amount of olive oil floating on top to mix in. And i must mention the gyro and the extra pita come out piping hot. While the Gyro is cooling off i recommend tearing apart the pita and dip it in hummus. Which is what i did. Ive had hummus at other places and it wasnt so great. Here it was on point. Never having Israeli salad before i wasnt sure what to expect. It looked sort of like Pico De Gallo but had great seasoning and spices in what i believe was a Olive oil sauce. Hell Id go back just for the salad. And for the price you will definitely leave full. I didnt have room for their baklava which is delicious. 
Next time you go, CALL ME and ill meet who ever is going."}
{"text":"We've eaten here about four maybe five times and every time it's been delicious! The main problem I have with this place is their music selection. 

I order a half chicken and lamb/beef plate. All is great! The service is good but every time they seem confused about my order. I want the pita that they serve with the 1/2 chicken to be whole not cut in half and every time it's a long conversation about it. Their sauces are very good and wonderful compliments for their food. 

The main complaint about this place it the terrible music! It is techno sometimes and other times dance music or trance music. It's always terrible! I don't want to listen to this music while I'm trying to enjoy a meal. 

I will come back but probably a take out order since the music is terrible."}
{"text":"Updating my review: So after posting a couple of minor mishaps, the owner messaged me, apologized and informed me he was the one who checked on us, etc. (it also didnt hurt that he was Armenian - as am I lol) but it automatically made me feel better to see that he not only reached out to me right away but was sincere about his response to my original review. Just for that alone I will give this place 4 stars because I understand things happen and Im not an unreasonable person. I will definitely come back again :) Thank you!"}
{"text":"How did I go to school at UNLV and never come here for lunch? It is still a surprise to me since I love Mediterranean food. I was stuck in my ways and went to the lounge down the street and completely overlooked this little shop. 

The important thing is that I have been guided towards this delicious find now. Meeting a friend here for dinner before the AFAN Black & White Ball was an excellent decision. Even though food was a part of the event, I saw very little of it. Filling up on gyros, Israeli salad, and babaganoush was a smart move. 

I never got to try the baklava when they participated in a past Yelp event. With everyone speaking so highly I was almost ready to try one until I stuffed myself. I passed during dinner. Then Tien came to the event with a tray of the good stuff and my willpower went out the window. 

Sometimes it pays to have foodie friends. They will never lead you astray and make sure you are full."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of the one but live on the Southeast than you will have reason to rejoice. The food is just as good and the convenience does not hurt. I have been here a few times and have enjoyed everything so far.

The gyro meat Greek salad is large and filling. A mountain of greens are topped with feta cheese, onions, olives, and no shortage of fresh shaved meat. The choices between salad dressings and pita bread makes it even better. The pomegranate vinaigrette and whole wheat pitas are the special touches to a classic. The gyro pita sandwich is filled to the brim with fresh ingredients when paired with fries and a drink, it is more than enough food. The most recent visit had me sharing a chicken skewers plate and that is enough food for two. A side of cucumber salad, hummus, and rice will have you full in no time."}
{"text":"Really good chicken shawarma! Prices are kinda expensive though. Check in for a free baklava"}
{"text":"Loved it!!!!!!! Food was fresh and tender!! The service was friendly. We will be back now that we found it!!!! Try it. You  will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Mm mm. Perfectly cooked chicken kabob along with very good vege kabob. Great hummus and warm soft pitas. Dolma was chilled and tasty. Was not thrilled about flimsy plastic cutlery but the food made up for it.  We also had gyro sandwiches and tasty spinach pie. Finished with perfect bite-sized baklava. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I got the beef filet wrap and loved every single bite.  I couldn't believe how tender the meat was and their hummus is rich and creamy.  I made my meal a combo with their seasoned fries, which come with their dipping sauce. Only weird thing was my husband and my hands smelled like garlic the entire night, even after washing them multiple times.

Great place and I took a menu home with me because they deliver!  If you dine in make sure to check in on yelp for a free mini baklava dessert."}
{"text":"I moved jobs from CSN to UNLV in January, and in doing so I left behind a lot of restaurants that I miss dearly.  Like a child switching schools mid semester, a stranger in a strange food landscape, I spent the first several weeks here missing my old friends Hedary's and Frijoles.  Thankfully I found solace in an old friend in an unfamiliar location with Stephano's.  

I frequent the Eastern location quite a bit and instantly had fallen for their gyros and rice bowls.  In a town full of Greek restaurants, I truly thought Stephano's was a cut above the rest.  In my first of many visits to this location I stuck mostly with the chicken kabob rice bowl.  Large, moist chunks of chicken served over delicious rice pilaf and an israeli salad.   Now in a futile attempt to actually reduce carbs, I usually get the Chicken Kabob salad which features those same chicken chunks over a standard greek salad of Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, Olives and Feta.  Pro Dental Tip:  Watch those olives!  My wiltering, aging mind sometimes can't keep up with all the different places I order greek salads from and can forget that they are not pitted here at Stephanos.    I mentioned my futile efforts to reduce carb intake.  Well they're made even more futile by the delicious wheat pita bread Stephano's offers.   They don't hold back either, usually providing 4 halves, usually wrapped in foil to keep them hot and fresh.   It would be a fair practice to eat these pita like the cookie monster eats cookies.  They're that good.

Stephano's also provides a nice little station full of jalapenos, hot sauces, and other fixins one can choose to indulge in.    Sriracha and greek food goes great together I quickly found out.

As a final note, today I learned about a new reward program they've implemented.  With a swipe of my credit card and after punching in my e-mail, I was told that anytime I used that card I'd get points.  Now with most businesses this would probably give me pause considering all of the recent data breaches at Target, etc.   I didn't even hesitate.  Identity theft would be worth this chicken and pita."}
{"text":"Stephano's is my latest addiction.   If the government ever outlawed mediterranean food I'd be like Bubbles from the Wire, walking the streets of Las Vegas looking for a hit of Gyro to \"scratch the itch\".   Thankfully it hasn't come to that and I can instead legally swing by Stephano's every few days (sometimes daily, it's come to that before) for a fix before the withdrawal symptoms set in.

I've tried several menu items.  My favorite overall item is probably just the gyro rice bowl.   It's basically a bowl of rice with several pieces of gyro meat and a small side of israeli salad (which always consists of seemingly fresh tomatoes and cucumbers) and some pita bread (white or wheat).   I think the portion size is perfect with the rice bowls as opposed to the plates which should only be used for feeding large families.   Okay that's a lie as I still from time to time will order a plate because really the food is so good I always want more even when I finish.   That's probably a medical disorder that I just admitted to you all, but I like these reviews to have that extra special personal touch to them.    The plates are a little more expensive, and are loaded with more meat, more rice, more everything essentially and some hummus to boot!   I can highly recommend the gyro plate, and also tried one of the mixed skewer plates with chicken and lamb, and everything was great.   On occasion I also will just get a straight up gyro or the \"cheese gyro\" which is the same but with feta.   Stephano's makes an excellent version of this classic.  The gyro meat, obviously the driving force, is always tender, juicy, and full of flavor.  They don't skimp on the meat either.  I usually get an order of feta fries with those, and don't be fooled by the order sizes of \"small\" or \"large\".    The small is large and the large is unconscionable.  Even if you're sharing with another, the small will do.   

The only item I've ordered that I wasn't a huge fan of was the chicken shawerma wrap.   I found the mix of tahini and garlic sauce to be overpowering and the chicken was overcooked.  It may have just been a one-time thing, but I haven't tried it again.   The other items that I mentioned above have more than made up for it.   I can safely say that if you stick with the dark meat, you'll be okay (someone less civilized than I could make a joke about Kim Kardashian here)

So whether you're jonesin' for falafel or just out for a one-time recreational usage of Tzatziki, let Stephano's be your pusher."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Stephano's for years and I have never been disappointed. 

Today I got the Gyro Salad, and it was good.  At first glance it looks like a paltry amount of sliced Gyro meat, but looks are deceiving.  There is plenty of meat to create a nice balance with all of the other salad ingredients which include:  fresh and bright green romaine lettuce, Roma tomatoes, a generous amount of crumbled feta cheese, Greek olives, and overly substantial amount of sliced raw white onions (note:  sizes of onion slices are also overly substantial).  The salad is also served with 2 grilled pitas, so it's not a light meal.

I recommend the salad; the dressing is basic but good with red wine vinegar and dried oregano as dominating flavors.  The gyro meat is grilled which is a nice touch, because like 99% of all gyro joints, Stephano's  uses the factory processed gyro force meat that tends to be salty, but the grilling cuts down on the saltiness.  They also take the time grill the pita bread and it makes a world of difference in the flavor and is much appreciated.

Stephano's only gets 3 stars from me for many reasons.  The prices are pretty high for a quick lunch place, my lunch was around $9.00 and there wasn't much to the preparation.  There was no perception of value, especially since it caters to people on a students' budget.  The amount of raw onions were insane.  I love raw onions but even after picking most of them off, I could feel the sulphurous onion essence seeping from my pores.  I'm going to class for the next 5 hours and I feel bad for those that have to sit around me.  Another thing that is hurting the star rating of Stephano's is the fact that they use those annoying pagers to notify you that your order is ready.  The pagers are constantly going off around you, they are annoying and stupid.

A few final notes; the free wifi is great and they do have a lunch/student special which offers a free drink with certain orders.  If you go during lunch, avoid the lunch rush (12:30 until 2:00 ish) it can get uncomfortably crowded in there."}
{"text":"Not authentic!!!!!!!! Not real Greek food. I sent my food back and asked for a refund. Gross!!!"}
{"text":"First time in, just happened to be in the area looking for a new place to try. Service and food were both great! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Place is very good. Every time I come here food is fresh and prepared well. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Not changing my review, just adding because I'm so obsessed with this place.
If you're also looking for a healthy alternative, they serve a \"low carb\" option for certain plate meals. It comes with double the meat and double servings of Israeli salad, side if tzatziki and the garlic sauce. Oh the garlic sauce  not gonna lie, thought it was butter at first. It is highly addicting and goes great on anything!
Also if I didn't already say this before, if you get any of their salads, try it with the creamy Greek dressing. Ugh! Making myself hungry as I'm writing this...
Service is always excellent! Everyone is super friendly."}
{"text":"Best Middle Eastern food in all of Las Vegas, I could eat it every day!"}
{"text":"We love that we have fresh, authentic restaurants near our house. Stephano's is the spot! Fresh made pita's, best rice I've ever had with super fresh cucumber tomato salad. If you see ever craving some authentic delicious Greek food this is the place to come!"}
{"text":"We always stop in for a plate when in Las Vegas, reasonably priced and fantastic flavors!"}
{"text":"For late lunch on a Saturday afternoon, a friend and former UNLV student suggested Stephano's. I loved that their menu had pictures as I am a visual person and I am horrible with food names. I had the rib eye steak shwarma combination that came with a side of fries. The shwarma was alright. The meat was a little on the dry side, but the other ingredients compensated for it. Their fries are excellent! I love crispy fries, and these were oh-so-crispy. They also have this cucumber dipping sauce that is really good with the pita bread. Another thing that I must mention is that Stephano's has a lot of different imported beers in their fridge. We tried at least 8 different beers, and they were around $3/bottle. They seriously have a lot of beer to choose from. We just stuck with the lower-priced ones. As for the environment, Stephano's was spacious, even on a Saturday. A few people came in to smoke hookah in the back. They have space reserved for that. All in all, this is a cool place. I'll keep it in mind if I'm ever craving Greek/Mediterranean in Vegas."}
{"text":"Combo plate was ok overall. The chicken shawarma was good but most of the trip tip shawarma was chewy, fatty, or grisly. The hummus was okay but the salad wasn't that good. Pita was soft and fresh."}
{"text":"Hate it. Good quality is trash. The falafel are very oil heavy and always burnt. All the salads taste store bought. The only decent thing is the pickled beets. Definitely never again."}
{"text":"I used to visit Stephano's all the time when I was on UNLV campus regularly. For four years, this location has allowed me to continue to frequent without the travel time. The strength for me has always been their consistency with fresh, made to order protein with portions large enough to leave me satisfied every time.

I have yet to try the lamb shank, but I've had the chicken and the shrimp which are pretty standard. My go-to is either the filet or the beef/lamb gyro meat. The beef is always tender and the roasted gyro meat is sliced with each order and seasoned just right to bring out the flavor of the meat. The wrap is the easiest way to eat your protein and usually the method of my preference, but you can also have your protein in a plate, salad, or in a rice bowl, which is what I had last. An order of hummus, Israeli salad, rice, and your choice of white or wheat pita comes with the plates.

Ordering is typical fast casual where you'll be given a number and the food will be brought out to you if you're dining inside or at one of the tables outdoor. Wait times are typically around ten minutes so order online or call it in if you're pressed for time. Expect prices right around $$/person obviously depending on what you order. Make sure you get your free order of baklava with check in.

Service is usually pretty friendly and accurate with the exception of our last visit when the young gentleman, who was a younger one of the family members that run the restaurant, seemed to be in a rush with everything causing him to make mistakes left and right. I don't know which train he had to catch but when I ordered at the counter he asked, \"is that it?\" after everything I said. Even though he took our order, he no recollection of it whatsoever when he delivered it not repeating the items we were receiving, dropping it off, and just leaving not asking if we needed anything else. When we looked at the order it wasn't ours and after bringing the order back to have it corrected, the young man was on the phone fumbling through receipts obviously doing damage control on another order he screwed up. Everything was rectified and our food was delicious, just be on the lookout for this kid."}
{"text":"Veggie Wrap & Chicken Kabob with Feta Fries  Mouthwatering with every bite! Plus FREE baklava if you check in = TOTAL SCORE! In addition, customer service was great."}
{"text":"I'm sad to leave a 3 Star review because the food has always been so amazing but the service today was crappy for the second time around ...

We have been coming here over a recommendation from a friend. We've loved the gyros and pitas and were never disappointed with whatever meal we had. 

Once we moved, we started getting more delivery to make life easier. That's when we started having crappy service. Whomever is the dude taking delivery orders is short, doesn't listen well, and likes to argue instead of find a solution. We tried to order online to avoid the call tonight and once again the website was broken. We had an item missing and onions on our gyros when we said no onions. When I called to get it corrected, the same guy just argued with me and told me that's not what my husband said (I was right there when we called) and so I said if there was no resolution we just won't order from them again. His response: \"okay.\" He didn't offer to deliver our missing items or to make anything right. 

Bummer, cuz the food rocks. So, if you don't mind below par service but good food, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Good gyros, quality meat, whole wheat pitas with yummy tzatziki sauce. My only complaint is I wish they had more meat in their gyros. For the price, I think they skimp on the quantity, and I say this after having had them on several occasions."}
{"text":"I just ordered postmates from Stephano's for myself and a friend. I can't comment on the customer service except to say that I thought the service was quick. 

What I can comment on it the food: it was delicious. I am so happy that they offer a low carb option and I am, frankly, happy to pay the price because the helpings are extremely generous and the Stephano's meat and Israeli salad are as good as it gets for me. 

Thanks for offering this option. I will definitely be eating more low carb Stephano's in the future."}
{"text":"Been here at least 3 times.  Food is great and prices reasonable.  Their gyro plates are delicious!  I don't even like lamb (I tried my boyfriend's meal) and thought the lamb gyro was actually tasty!  The israeli salad is good, the pitas are good also---i typically get wheat, but the hummus is a little bland.  But that's probably because it's pretty authentic and I'm used to the hummus' they sell at Trader Joes.  :)  All-in-all, great place to pick dinner for the family or just yourself!"}
{"text":"Great Food! I ordered the chicken plate with fries instead of rice, comes with a salad, hummus pita.  French fry sauce is yum!! It's portioned enough where 2 people can eat a plate. Definitely a must try for greek and Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"This place was quite a disappointment. First off the staff at the cash register was not very friendly, somewhat rushing me through taking my order even though there were no one waiting behind me. 

Once the food came the meats were half burnt, dry, and flavorless. The salad was also soggy and drowned in dressing that was way too sour. Even the gyro bread was old, and although served warm, it cooled quickly and was hard as rocks. 

This place was way overpriced for the low quality food that was served. 

There are other options for Mediterranean food in this area, I wouldn't recommend this place, and definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"A lunch at Stephano's is worth the 10 dollars. It's family owned and operated, roomy, welcoming, and never too busy. It's within walking distance of UNLV and open late, it makes a perfect study hang out or casual lunch spot. They have the BEST French fries, kebabs, garlic sauce, and the Israeli salad is marinated in love or something because I cannot even approximately recreate it in my own kitchen. Outside seating is nice in the spring time, and they also serve more than basic domestic beers (Almaza, Kirin, Flying Horse, etc) and hookah, which is served in the back. I have never had a dissapointing meal at Stephano's (even when it was the greasy hole-in-the-wall formerly known as the Daily Chicken), which is saying a lot since I ate 80% of all my meals here in college."}
{"text":"We went to this resturant, always in pursuit of another great place to dine. We found this establishment to be very good. If if I had to compare it to Meraki and Yassou, it would come in 3rd. The pita was dry. I had the Gyro salad and the portion on the meat was light. We also had the steak kabob bowl, meat was very tasty...all in all the food was very good. I've just had better"}
{"text":"I used to always go to the one near UNLV, but knowing now that it opened up by my house I can finally satisfy my cravings. All the plates are really good, if you get the plate you'll have some to take home. If you just need something just right, definitely get a bowl. Also if you want a nice lunch meal, I highly recommend the wrap--I'm stuffed now. Anyway 10/10 I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food I've ever had. Seriously the best! I can come here any day, everyday! The atmosphere is amazing, the food is perfect and very authentic. 
The staff is always super friendly and they never have a problem answering questions about the food. I've actually met Stephano a few times as well and he's a very nice man.
My favorite thing I get is the chicken shawerma, with of course the French fries. Probably the best French fries I've ever had. I'm from Fresno, Ca but I visit family in Vegas every month, so every time I'm here I never forget stop by Stephanos.
Beside the amazing fries, the shawerma is perfect, I love the gyro as well, and you can never go wrong with the garlic chicken press sandwiches! 
Also, the last two times I went, I got the pasticcio and I fell in love with it. I'm gonna have a hard time deciding between the shawerma and pasticcio next time!!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad they opened another Stephano's in Henderson! I have a lot of family who lives there and I make sure that every time I visit them, that I at least come to Stephano's once, if not, every day I'm there! The food is always consistant and I'm in love with their hummus! I can't get enough of this place. I only wish they had one in California. Not only is the food amazing, but the employees are really nice! They always answer every question with a smile on their face, and they really know how to take great care of their customers. 
If you're looking for an amazing Mediterranean Grill, Stephano's is definitely the place for you!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The service was great. The owner Nick was very friendly. You have try the grilled Nutella Pita."}
{"text":"I admit - it took a couple times to adjust to this style of gyro versus Chicago style. These have a different spice - not sure what it is, but now that I'm used to it, I love it. 

I am addicted to the gyro and fries with sauce combo. That sauce is amazing. Almost like Chick fil a. The amount of fries that you get is surprising. I've also enjoyed the Lamb/ Beef gyro salad with the creamy Greek dressing. 

Service is always good and the inside has a nice, modern and open feel to it. Friendly staff. 

Only negative is that I've seen huge disparities in portion size, particularly on the salad. Sometimes it's heaping with gyro meat and sometimes it's cut pieces with 1/3rd of the meat."}
{"text":"Tasty Greek food, good customer service. 
Lamb shank was delicious. 
Restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Ordered the lamb leg, & gyro. 

The lamb leg was soooooo good. the portion size was huge, and the meat just fell off the bone. It tasted like it had been roasting & slow cooking for hours. The person I was with did away with the polite pretense of cutting the meat off the bone with a fork & knife and instead just ripped at it like a dog... It was that good. 

My gyro was fine, pretty standard, and satisfied my craving for Mediterranean food. Generous portions of meat and it came with two Pitas. I'm used to my gyros having more veggies in it, so the little slices of tomato were fine, but not what I was expecting. My meal came with tsatiziki and tahini. 

The store was clean, had a self serve pickle-like-stuff station, & self serve drinks.  

It's an interesting set up because its very casual (order at a counter, food is brought out to you, you bus your own table), but it sometimes felt like their method of preparing food would be better served as a formal sit down restaurant. For example, their prices were a bit higher than what you'd expect from a \"fast food\" place, but once you taste it you understand why. And their service was a bit slow, we waited about fifteen to twenty minutes before getting our food. The longish wait for a fast food place is not an issue considering how awesome that lamb was, just wish I knew what to expect before going. Now that I know, I won't go there if I'm in a hurry, but will definitely make time for it now."}
{"text":"Probably my new favorite \"healthy\" restaurant.  The chicken shawarma with garlic sauce...so delicious.....I can literally smother everything in that garlic sauce.  I literally mixed it into my rice as well.  The chicken was tender, juicy, and seasoned well.  The cucumber tomato salad was nice and refreshing.  The shawarma plate is huge and comes with pita and hummus.  My daughter got chicken shawarma and fries....those fries are some crispy well seasoned fries.  I couldn't help but steal a few from her plate.  There's also an outdoor area for kiddos so they can run around while the adults eat as well."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch based on Yelp reviews. Good food & generous portions. Would definitely come back & would recommend."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed to only rate Stephano's as three star. This place used to be a rave review for me, but it's gone downhill lately.

They still throw their fresh, tender pitas on the grill, imparting a smoky char that adds depth to the flavor of sandwiches.

But there's less in the sandwiches than there used to be, and prices don't nearly justify the amount of food you get. Four slices of gyros meat on that sandwich. Three falafel balls on a pita for almost seven dollars? There are times when I can eat three Stephano's sandwiches and not be full.

Their fries seem like a poor imitation of the famed Athens Fries served up the street at Paymon's. The tabbouleh is OK, maybe a little salty. Grape leaves are textbook. The hummus is simple and adequate but nothing special.

Oh, and they have a tendency to forget items. Check your inventory.

They do have a notable selection of bottle beers and teas. There's also a Foursquare check-in deal for a free baklava with $5 purchase.

This place is OK but it's not what it used to be. Sad face."}
{"text":"The food was great but it was $10 for one gyro with feta cheese that's way too much I won't return due to the price points. I was still hungry after a gyro too. At least make it big if it's $10"}
{"text":"After being disappointed again and again by falafel joints, this place was a very welcome change.  The falafel was tasty and the best I've had in LV in well over a year.  In fact, I liked some of their other menu items even more than the falafel since I got the vegetarian combo.  The combo came with the spinach pie, hummus, falafel, grape leaves and tabbouleh.  That's a serious meal.  There's no joking around here!! :P

The spinach pie was the best thing on my plate.  The crisp and crunch of the phyllo dough combined with cheese and seasoned spinach was an unbelievable combo of flavors.  I would order a whole pan of this for takeout.  

And how can you beat a free piece of baklava with a Yelp check in?  CAN'T!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and very nice people. I go to UNLV so it's very refreshing to have such a good restaurant so close to campus."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mediterranean/Greek food restaurants in town!!! Delivery is pretty quick! The food is seriously to die for!! And I cannot get enough of the garlic paste spread and pitas!! Highly recommend this place!! Everything I have gotten from them I have loved!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service and amazing happy hour specials. I frequent this place a lot and have for many years. I am rarely disappointed in all aspects."}
{"text":"A bit pricy...$22 for the 1 regular gyro meal & 1 regular gyro meal with feta cheese (and technically, the drinks are \"free\" before 3pm).  The meat was tasty, but not as much in there as other places.  I would've also liked more than 2 tomatoes.  On the plus side, they didn't hold back on the feta, and the tzatziki was really good.  

The fries were good, but I really enjoyed the dipping sauce for them.  (Not sure what it was, but it does have a nice bite to it).

Service was good.  They bring the food to your table, which is nice.  While they were pretty busy, the wait wasn't too bad and the food was hot.  

Ultimately, despite the cost, it was an above average experience overall, but still not close to my favorite Greek place in the valley."}
{"text":"Yum. Busy, friendly place. First visit for our family as we are new to the area. We will go back. Everything was flavorful and cooked perfectly. Shwarma pita was great.  Grandson had the kids chicken kebab amd devoured  it. I topped the meal off with baklava and it was one of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"i've been on a hummus kick lately(just checked out Hummus Bar) and when I was at school and yelped hummus this spot came up and I was psyched. 

Ordered an order of hummus and two chicken kebabs. The portion was a very good size.The price is also very low, I paid the same amount as Hummus Bar but got twice the amount of food.

I would say the hummus is of  equal quality  maybe not as smooth as HB but it's not even noticeable. However Stephano's pita is a bit on the harder side and I prefer mine soft and fluffy like at HB's."}
{"text":"So I live in LA and I was planning a Birthday Party for my husband in Vegas at The Cosmopolitan on 1/30/16. I wanted food to be catered/delivered to the room for about 20 people. Upon looking at places I came across Stephano's...so happy I decided to go with them! Absolutely great food and very generous portions!! Plus they came & set up and brought paper goods which really made life easier! To top it off, the catering prices are great compared to anything else you can get that's delivered straight to your room. Maria helped me with all the details and I was very pleased with everything. A million thanks!! I will definitely stop by when we return to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Lunch today was on point...cheese beef n lamb gyro with hummus and baklava for free upon Yelp check in..."}
{"text":"I got stuffed at the new Stephano's.  After cycling class, my friends headed over here for Valentine's Day dinner.  Josh said he'd already eaten there two days in a row for lunch, but was game to eat there twice in one day, it was that good. I was just looking forward to spanakopita and baklava, which I assume every Greek place has. Much like the Great Greek and Greek Bistro, Stephano's is more of a casual establishment where you order at the counter and then your food is brought to you.  I chose the Vegetarian Combo and had water, a $13.50 meal and a bargain when I saw the amount of food that was brought to me a few minutes later.  Hummus, two stuffed grape leaves, wheat pita bread, spinach pie, tabbouleh, and falafel--great goodness me!  It was definitely a combo.  I was disappointed in the spinach pie--flat, a little overbaked, and more phyllo than spinach. The rest of the food was good and I couldn't finish everything. Then, one of the employees brought a platter of baklava to the table and gave us each a piece for free--score!  THEN, Anna gave me her piece--double score!!  Josh ate his--whatever.  All in all, it was a pleasant way to end the Hallmark Holiday and I'd eat there again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. My boyfriend & I come in here a lot and never leave disappointed. Wish this location had pastitsio but still hands down the best Greek food in LV."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Greek food ! Fresh tasteful and clean this place is to upbeat and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Such an great place! You can order online, staff is friendly, and most importantly the food is AMAZING! I abuslotely love this place."}
{"text":"Was by UNLV and have seen this place a few times and decided what the heck let's give it a shot.

I'm glad I did.  Absolute delicious. Had a Gyro it was great and nice sized.  We also had a salad which was wonderful.  And last a plate with rice beef shewerma humus omg it was so good and tasty.  Great portions too.

We will definitely be back again.  I say definitely worth going. Fast friendly service and great food."}
{"text":"Beef kabob was tender and flavorful. Also enjoyed the falafel and rice. The pitas were from a package but overall meal good."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday (4/4/11) after my performance for my sister's directing class with my scene partner Kristian D. and my sister Sarah. Kristian ordered a garlic chicken sandwich with fries for herself, and I split a cheese gyro (gyro w/ feta included) with Sarah. 

The ambiance was good, and the place was really clean. The bathrooms were pretty nice too. We all sat in the back corner on the cushions and spent an hour+ chatting. 

My gyro was good ($7.52 w/ tax included) and surprisingly, Sarah, who usually hates feta, liked it. Unfortunately, Kristian said her chicken tasted like fish so she only ate half of it. It was probably residual flavor from the grill. Oh, and they also serve pickled turnips on the condiment bar, so I had to grab a heap of those. 

Would I be back? Yeah, if my parents are paying!"}
{"text":"Coming from La I have had so much good Mediterranean food and have yet to find something  truly comparable in Vegas. Tried this place for the free baklava and it was fairly close to my apt. I ordered the combination chicken and kofta kabob. The chicken was juicy and tender while the kofta was dry and tasted like it was sitting out for awhile. The rice that came with my meal was dry and undercooked. Maybe I came on an off day?  I liked the garlic sauce and the baklava was tasty so I will be back to try them out again hopefully ill have a better experience next time!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Greek food I have had and delivery was ok on time. The chicken was not at all delicious and possibly not cooked all the way. The rice was mushy, not fresh tasting, gyro meet was not flavorful, fries were ok. The salad was not fresh. I ate simply because this would be a waste and no other option for a while. I did not finish and I will not eat Stephano's again."}
{"text":"Food: chicken kabob plate which included rice, hummus, pita, cucumber/tomato salad and a drink all for $13. Very tasty! Chicken was moist and grilled to perfection. The salad was very tangy/lemony and I really enjoyed that. I always like a side of lemon so I'm glad they had help yourself lemons by the fountain drink station. Hubby had the filet minion steak plate for $16 which was also super tender.  Also did the Yelp check in for free baklava which was buttery goodness. 

Decor: very clean and nice bench seating indoor and outdoor. 

Service: friendly and helpful. You order and pay at the counter and they bring the food to you. 

Location: conveniently located in the Smiths plaza near 31 Baskin Robbins ice cream."}
{"text":"So I've been to Stephano's 3 times now, and each time I'm pleased with the quality of food and price. It's a small place within a crowded plaza with several other food options, but this place is worth fighting for parking for!

Like I said already, Stephano's is small...it's got several tables inside and one or two outside, with an open kitchen that you can see right into. The menu is pretty big (and so are the portions), with sandwiches, salads, rice bowls, and meals (as if everything else isn't a meal??). I've had the gyro rice bowl and I love it! It comes with rice, gyro meat and a tomato/cucumber salad. You can get other meats instead of gyro, but I love me some gyro meat! The bowl comes with white or wheat pita, which I found the white pita to taste too doughy and under cooked. The wheat pita was delicious, but also a bit too doughy. Certain times of day, the bowls and salads come with a drink...get the iced tea! It's delicious!!!

The staff has always been professional & courteous, though I wouldn't really go so far as to say that they're friendly. The service is quick and you can be in and out pretty fast if you're on a deadline (not as fast as an actual fast food restaurant...everything here is made to order). 

Stephano's is tasty overall and definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I just took some food for to go and i went home and opened the baklava is so old and dry like 2 days old . I am european and i know how it should be . Because its in the package they can give u the old peaces . Plus the pitta bread used to be so good now its pre-maid and bought from Costco or reataurant depot . It is not worth the $25 i spent . I will never eat there again !"}
{"text":"I love Stephano's! I not a huge Greek food lover but Stephano's hits the spot for me. I used to get the chicken gyro but now I'm more about the chicken kabob plate. Their chicken is moist and very tasty! They also have great hummus and their rice is quite amazing. I could live on chicken and rice as long as it's done well. When you check in you can get a free baklava, and their baklava is also very good. Comes in pretty small pieces but it is worth it, it almost reminds me of a flaky gooey cinnamon twist from great buns bakery, if you've ever tried that. Everything I have had from Stephano's has been exceptional in my eyes, that means a lot coming from someone who isn't a huge Greek food lover. It can be a little pricey and take a while but it is worth it."}
{"text":"GOOD GREEK FOOD WALKING DISTANCE FROM UNLV. I couldn't ask for more. I just walked here right quick after class. My gyro was amazing.. I got a free baklava from checking in. I couldn't be happier!"}
{"text":"My husband has been wanting to try Greek food and I wanted him to have a great impression, I read the reviews and figured this would be a good place to start. 

The staff was incredibly friendly and there were regulars who gave up their seat unasked to accommodate a large party (not us), very good start and first impression. Food came out quickly and was incredibly flavorful, tasted fresh and homemade (there is a difference!). I checked in and got the baclava for free, walked out with a dozen because we loved it so much. 

We went early, it was pretty busy but they moved quickly. When we left there was a line to order with tables filling up. It's an open kitchen which is always a good sign, looked clean and everyone was working really hard. 

Also, they have beer and wine. Bottle of the Greek lager was $3.75 and wine (plastic glass but tasted good) was $5.50, definitely one of the more affordable places to have drinks with a meal."}
{"text":"I ordered to go . I see that my food was ready and just needed to be bagged but the 2 girls were just standing around and having a conversation and I can hear it was not work related. One girl told me my food will be ready soon but they kept on talking and talking. All they really needed to do was put the food in the plastic bag. If she just pack my food it would have taken a few seconds and handed it to me but instead they kept talking and talking. This was the location across Southern Hills Hospital."}
{"text":"Delicious food that tastes fresh. They also have the BEST baklava! This is definitely a frequent lunch spot since it's right down the street from work!"}
{"text":"For what it's worth -- Stephano's Greek & Mediterranean Grill is pretty freaking official. I was pretty impressed by their wide variety of options on the menu. You can legit get your fix with lamb, chicken, veggie, etc. The feta fries....oh man. Let's talk about the feta fries. SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO good. Stephano's is affordable as it is delicious. I ordered the gyro plate and devoured the entire thing. They totally give you more than enough to split with two people. The service was awesome and on point. My coworkers and I sat outside in the patio area which was a nice touch. Really enjoyed my meal and the service!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  I ordered the Gyro salad and treated myself to a baklava.  They did a great job in remodeling and cleaning the place up.  They have a huge menu so you have plenty of options of food. Side note: if you get the salad ask for light cheese (unless you like it heavy) because they give you a lot of it!  It is a little pricey for me, considering the service is ordered at the counter, but I will be back to try a few more times!"}
{"text":"I had ordered catering from Stephano's but unfortunately a technical mishap occured and my order got lost.  Stephano's was quick to make the order on the spot and deliver it to me as fast as they could.  On top of that, they threw in some Baklava, which my staff RAVED about.  The rest of the food was very tasty.  Accidents happen, but Stephano's definitely made it right."}
{"text":"Great Gyros just 10 mins from home. It was better than others we have ordered from!  Fast delivery too."}
{"text":"I had this for dinner and it was really good seasoned very well. I had 1 veggie 1 shrimp kabob. The plates come with salad, hummus, rice, and pitas. I had enough food for dinner and lunch. I also tried the baklava, very light and crispy, not too sweet. I would totally eat here again"}
{"text":"Stepphano's is my go to for everything Greek. You will not be disappointed! Unfortunately I had to move away from Vegas and I'm constantly craving them so anytime I visit and most recently celebrated a milestone birthday and reached out to Maia for a catering order. Let's just say there wasn't anything left....I didn't think about getting a picture of my setup before it was almost eaten up. Any time I'm in Vegas I make it a point to stop in here and enjoy everything from , hummus, the grape leaves, salad, gyro, all the kabobs & baklava!! I'll  be back in soon"}
{"text":"Foods is way too expensive for what you get. The food was not that great and gave us sour stomachs. They served this glorified \"pico de gallo\" as a side item (gross) Do not recommend at all. They really need to come up with better prices for what you're getting and maybe serve a side salad instead of a blob of onions, tomatoes and cilantro. ."}
{"text":"Not bad.
I am from a Greek family so I try a lot of Greek food.
I got this food second hand from my mom. She had ordered it earlier that day.
The best thing was the gyro, and the yogurt sauce they use.
Chicken kabob was pretty decent. 
The falafel was VERY good! Not dry at all, very good flavor.

Very unique little cheese sandwiches. The one I ate was pita with feta in the middle.
Was a bit drab, but they have good pita bread.

I would have to visit this place again  to give it a better review. Otherwise, the food IS fresh and I overall would consider it again,the vegetarian plate looks really good, and i give bonus points to places with vegetarian options. I am curious to try more, it is decent greek."}
{"text":"The chicken schwarma and beef lamb gyro was what we had during our first visit and it was one of the best we've had as compared to other mediterranean places we've tried. They have a dog friendly patio and the ambiance is very casual with great lighting. We definitely plan to be back and have our dog Charlie join us this time!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are big fans of Greek and Mediterranean food, in general. We love the gyros at Stephano's, but everything we've tried there is quite good, including the passion fruit tea.The kitchen is visible right behind the cashier, and we like seeing the cooking staff in action in their very clean kitchen. We're regulars, eating there at least once a month."}
{"text":"I am very critical of Greek food after having worked at a Greek restaurant in the past, and visiting Greece this last summer...
And I was very impressed with this spot! Place was super clean, food was bomb, and the crew was very helpful with the menu! Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"First, let me say that the food is good.  Quite good in fact.  However,  the prices aren't in line with a faster food style, informal  / take away place.  

I've picked up take out from here, twice now.  I'm going to say that the food (even 5 minutes before closing) has been consistent.  

Now, I'm going to get into pricing  (which is where I am bummed out )  almost 30 bucks for 2 people to eat take out is pretty spendy in my book. 

The Falafel Wrap is good ( as a vegetarian option,  it should have lettuce on it,  I did order lettuce on it, but noticed when I got home that someone had forgotten to put it on) But 7, (Yes! SEVEN Dollars) for a falafel wrap, is , (just the wrap) is kinda over priced....



I also got a large greek salad, 8 dollars Lg, 7 dollars Sm. Good salad,  but when a person orders an 8 dollar salad,  I was really disappointed at the tiny amount of olives, 7 unpitted olives. Major hazard,  as there's no note on the container,  about pitts. 
After searching the menu (in super tiny print,  I found - Olives contain pits) Now, again 8 bucks for a salad isnt crazy, but its not cheap either.  7 olives,  and it is a real bummer that Stephanos, doesn't pit their olives,  at the price point that they're charging,  please pit the olives!  

I also ordered a Beef & Lamb Gyro wrap, husband said it was good, but that the meat was dry :/ but that it had good flavor. 

I'm sure that I will eat here again,  but I would love to see a daily special,  or a reasonably priced lunch special.  

The fries are good, but should be served hot."}
{"text":"Right when you walk in the door you smell the awesome food cooking. I had the beef and lamb gyro with fries combo. The first bite of the fries with their dipped my sauce was like eating a little pice of heaven. The gyro was stuffed with meat and tomatoes and the tazikis sauce was very flavorful and added so much to the gyro. I will definitely recommend this place to friends and will also become a regular to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Mediocre not authentic. The Israeli salad was old . I told them about it,they brought a new one mixed in with the old one . The chicken my husband ordered was dry . My steak was lukewarm and was difficult cutting up with a plastic knife. Not be returning.."}
{"text":"Stefano has amazing food! The lamb kabob is always my all time favorite and it was cooked to perfection! Other place would have tougher and over cooked lamb but this place cooked it perfectly! Their baklava was good too and it wasn't too sweet which I like."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the gyro with feta on it and it was superb! One of the best gyros I've ever had! The only downsides I saw were that the menus were not super easy to read while standing in line so you end up taking a long time to read the menu when you get to the register. Price was a bit high for one gyro and a drink (14 bucks) but the food was good so I can't complain too much!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! If we lived closer we'd be frequent guests here. Had the gyro pita plate or something of that nature. The free dessert we got for checking in on yelp wasn't my favorite, but my husband really liked it."}
{"text":"Overall pretty good. Not as consistent as I like. One day the hummus was awesome, the next time it was watery. One day the chicken kabob was amazing the next it tasted a little stale.
The chicken schwarma was pretty good, the dolma were good, the rice was \"meh\" and the israeli salad was awesome. I would go back, but it is not my goto spot for middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Amazing Greek & Mediterranean food. Discovered this place when we moved to Henderson. They also DELIVER which is a plus. This is our go to place when we want Greek food :)"}
{"text":"This place has replaced what used to be Khoury's which I loved going to. The food here is a little different but better for pick up and take home. The falafel and gyro plates are reasonably priced and contain plenty of food. Their side sauces also have pretty good flavor! I will continue to order from here."}
{"text":"The hubs and I are fairly addicted to making our own hummus, so we're a bit hesitant to try hummus elsewhere, and we NEVER touch store bought hummus.  However, we decided to try this place a few weeks ago and WOW.  Delicious!  The owner was actually there and my hubs was so ecstatic about the food that he asked to give him a high five.  The owner obliged but it really is that good.  I got chicken shawerma plate and my hubs got the combo plate with beef and lamb.  Their pita bread was to die for and the hummus was delicious.  My only complaint was the dining area was very small but I don't think they had a choice on that!  Maybe they can expand, but it's worth the price so delicious/"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious. So much flavor and care in every bite. I ordered the beef shawarma plate and a couple of orders of rice pudding. I also got a free baklava for checking in. The baklava was so freakin good but it was a miniature size. Smart tactic on their end because I now want a whole tray to myself lol. 

No but seriously, I have no complaints. Yes, it's a little pricey but it is 1000% worth the price. The quality of the meat, the flavor, the tenderness, it's excellent. Not to mention all of the sauces, the soft pita bread and the flavorful rice. If I had the funds to eat here multiple times a day, every day, I absolutely would do it and never get tired of it.

I also highly recommend trying the feta fries. Or plain fries with either the \"cucumber sauce\" or their special fry sauce. Just don't miss out on their fries! So freakin good!"}
{"text":"My family and I had never been to Stephanos. The service was wonderful. What a great staff! The food was amazing. We had the beef and lamb gyros. Wow does not even begin to describe it. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Overall: Amazing!!! A must eat for anyone visiting Sin City! 

I had my 1st Gyro here early 2009 and since then can't find a Gyro anywhere close to 1/2 as good.  Came back this week after searching google maps to find my Cinderella and WOW!!! I will forever visit this place every time I am in Vegas! 

My wife also went 1st time today and loves it as much as I do( after turning down my hunt for it 6 months ago)

Plates: Steak and Lamb! 
*Perfect grill flavor
*Right amount of sauce
*Crispy Onions
*Warm slightly toasted Pita bread

Recommend: Yes, Highly recommend to anyone that has the time to visit. And I'm not a fan of Greek food."}
{"text":"Moved to Vegas 2 weeks ago and I have already ate at this place twice. Really good beef shawarma and grilled chicken! Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"After getting shortchanged on the shrimp on 2 skewers I ordered, I reviewed this with 3 stars. The owner reached out, but I didn't feel like downloading a coupon. However, I noticed the next time I ordered, they made up for my 2 missing shrimp!

The food here really is very good, and it's one of my Team's favorites. I love the steak kabob and the shrimp skewers. My team loves the feta fries!"}
{"text":"Good \"Greek\" food when you're craving it. Although not the best tzatziki I've had, I was impressed for a restaurant deemed more fast food.

Definitely not an eat-and-go place so don't come in if you're on a time crunch. Been there twice in the last two weeks and it's always been a bit long for simpler menu items.

I usually always order the gyro plate and am satisfied with the volume of food. Last time the gyro meat was cooked but served cold. Fiancé had her gyro happily replaced because meat was cold. Disappointed to see it was attempted to be served.

Will continue being a customer, but a loyalty program would be nice for one of the more expensive options in town."}
{"text":"Chicken kabobs are great. Beef shawarma and kabobs are great as well. I didn't like the chicken shawarma.  The chicken shawarma is made with legs and thighs and I felt like it wasn't trimmed enough, a lot of fat.  I love the whole wheat pita.  Be sure to get pickled turnips by the drink fountain, they are so amazing! The house made sauces are delicious!"}
{"text":"Quick pick up for take out order but I was disappointed in the chicken shwarma. Very dry and tough tasted like dried up ends just sitting there! Everything else fries gyro were very flavorful it's just too bad the chicken tastes like rubber."}
{"text":"Really tasty food after a hike close by.  Yummy pickeled Jalapeños too!  Nice patio."}
{"text":"The best shawerma in las vegas handsdown! The one in decatur doesn't even stand a chance."}
{"text":"Fabulous food. We spent $50+ on lunch just so we could try lots of things...and they were ALL delicious! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas...period!  The gyro rice bowl is out of this world with the rice, Israeli salad, gyro meat & tasty tzaziki sauce! 
I've had Mediterranean food many times before, but all that I have tried at Stephano's has been delicious. And for the price...you can't beat it! They even have a groupon sometimes so make sure to check in on Yelp for deals & with groupon!
Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Ohhh my dear Stephano's.... so tasty and conveniently located to home. I always get the beef and lamb gyro plate which comes with a generous portion of meat, rice, and also hummus and pita bread for $14. Personally, I do feel that this place is on the pricier end but you can't put a price on fresh, authentic food. Oh also, do yourself a favor and get the feta fries!! Delicious. 

The interior is clean and aesthetically pleasing. They have an outdoor patio where I've taken my dog before, which is very nice. The reason I've taken off a star is because the few times I've been here, service hasn't been very friendly and I've felt like a bother coming up to order. But other than that, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food and service!  If is often hard to find good Greek food. This place was amazing. Staff friendly and great ambiance"}
{"text":"I've been here a dozen times and that says a lot for being new in town.  My husband and I like to try a variety of cuisine and good Mediterranean food can be hard to find.  

What looks like a chain restaurant, with a huge menu, is surprisingly a really great place to dine in.  They must cook everything fresh, because even ordering meat off the spit, can take awhile.  Don't expect a quick dine-in experience, because they're always busy with take-out orders, even if the restaurant appears to be half empty.  Trust me, it's with the wait. 

The chicken kabob is super tender and flavorful with the obvious choice of being the healthiest option if you're opting for a diet meal.  They have filet mignon served as steak kabobs and they are out of this world tender with really great marinade.  The lamb/beef gyro off the spit is usually high in sodium, but always satisfying.  The tri tip steak, though a little tougher than the filet, is still thinly sliced and makes stuffing my pita into a sandwich even more satisfying.  

They offer wheat pita bread and the tzaziki sauce along with their garlic spread is the best combination when smothering my meat in those sauces.  Though their pita bread is packaged, I do appreciate the fact that they make it a point to offer both white and wheat pita bread.  

Their cucumber salad is refreshing and has a bit of a kick to it.  Their rice is pretty good, as I could taste that it's cooked in chicken broth.  

Some of the stuff may be a bit generic, but overall, you can beat the price for the quality and quantity of food here.  I appreciate the coupons in the mail that offers 50% off and free drinks for most of their meals during lunch hours everyday.  Yelp check-in offers a free baklava, but I'll pass on that honey filled pastry that just taste like sugar overload."}
{"text":"Always a huge fan of Stephano's Greek restaurant across from UNLV. They have been here quite awhile. And, while a little pricey, their food is always solid. Personally I am a huge fan of their gyro specials and the fries come seasoned just right. I haven't really tried to much else on their menu with the exception of the baklava which is pretty good as well. I have heard good things about the evenings their as they serve hookah and the place turns into some hookah lounge kind of thing. Can't really say much about this place outside of lunch time. Overall though, a great place."}
{"text":"Craving gyros and willing to try to search for a closer Greek joint led me to Stephano's.

We got the chicken gyro, a gyro bowl, and an additional large side of hummus. The two cashiers were nice and we got our food fairly quickly. Everything was carefully packed and delicious! My gyro bowl was outstanding, the rice is definitely what makes it! The beef+lamb meat was sooo good, there was definitely a good amount. No skimping here! The hummus was good and the pita was soft and warm. The only downside was that there was no lettuce in the chicken gyro. I had to double-check the online menu to confirm this. It's ok, it was still devoured in true fat fashion. I also got the free baklava when I checked in and the girl was really nice helping me figure out how to check in (yeah, I'm like an old person lol) it was my first time having one and it was yummy!!! 

One word about he pricing of the hummus. Unless you really, really don't want a lot of hummus, it's best to put in another $2 to get the large size as the small size is pretty small.

I would come back for the gyro bowl and baklavas!!! . I'll probably give the delivery service a shot as well since we live close by and I'm pretty lazy ^_^"}
{"text":"Mediterranean food never goes wrong. 

I came during lunch time after dropping off a package at the post office nearby, which was crowded and full of customers in the dining room but luckily there wasn't a line. 

I ordered the Chicken Schwerma Pita Wrap (Wheat) combo, which came with fries and I opted for the Tropical Iced Tea they had on hand. 

The dipping sauce for the fries/pita wrap was delicious, although there was already enough flavors in the wrap for me to not dip/drizzle in the goodness."}
{"text":"Even though there's Stephano's near UNLV, I was in the neighborhood and decided to try out the greatness... 

And I'm totally glad I did! Ordered a 1/2 flame grilled chicken (dark) with wheat pita, Israeli salad, hummus and a side of garlic spread(?) 

Completely delicious, although next time I'd probably sit there and eat to have it still nice and hot, instead of making the trek home and eating it warm. 

I'll definitely be back or try the location near school if I've got time for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I don't often eat at Mediterranean restaurants, but this may change that. I ordered the Chicken kabob plate for lunch. The chicken was juicy, well seasoned and delicious. The rice was very good. The plate came with Israeli salad which was delicious and fresh. And the pita bread, well I could live off of that. It was warm and practically melted in my mouth. The inside of the restaurant was clean and had plenty of seating. They have outside seating too, but it was a little too hot outside for that. The employees were all pleasant and the order was ready quickly. Thank you guys. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, we had the tri tip plate and the gyro plate. The meat was so tender, the hummus was really good too. We checked in and got the free baklava for dessert and it was so good.  The good taste fresh and everything is well seasoned. At first I thought it was a bit pricey but then I saw all the good they give it's well worth it. My daughter loved the pita bread and she's 2."}
{"text":"I always hit this place in after the gym to get the quick protien from their awesome filet mignon kabobs. The rice is phenominal tasting as well, stop wasting time, get there now, haha. They earned their stars with great tasting food."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with my order.  I ordered thru Postmates and asked for some sauces for my order.   I would have gladly have paid a fee but instead received none of what I asked for."}
{"text":"If I were to die tomorrow and I could only have one more meal, I would order the lamb gyro and fries from this exact place. Pure heaven. I've been eating here since it was a tiny, little, brand new place. It's so popular that it grew into the neighboring store as well. I'll come here until the day I die. I've had gyros from all over the world and this is always the place I compare other gyros against because they are my top choice."}
{"text":"Stephano's has been on my list for months. With so many greek and mediterranean places in Henderson I rarely stray from my 2 \"go to spots\".

When walking in you notice the open kitchen and the meat roasting on the spits, We were greeted quickly and placed our to go orders. We started with a small baba ganoush and pita. For entrees I had the chicken souvlaki wrap on a wheat pita and my other half had a shrimp kabob salad. They offer free drinks with any wraps or gyros and also we received free baklava for checking in on Yelp! 

It was quite a long wait (around 20 minutes) as everything is prepared fresh and it was the busy lunch hour. I highly recommend ordering by phone or online before arriving. Now for the food:

The baba ganoush was just ok. Comparing it to crazy pita it was much more \"chunky\" and not smooth. It also lacked the real smoky flavor that I love. I thought the chicken souvlaki wrap was very good. The chicken was moist and juicy and had a nice char from the grill. The pita was soft and had the right amount of tomato, onion and tzatziki. The shrimp kabob salad was large and also very good. The one complaint was that the tails were left on the shrimp. 

Overall we enjoyed Stephanos, I don't think it was good enough to stop frequenting my other two spots, but if in the area I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely nice and helpful. The food I thought was just average. If i'm in the area and need a quick Greek food fix, but I wouldn't drive across town just to come back."}
{"text":"My husband ordered their gyro, he said it was delicious, the last time he had a gyro was years ago in New Jersey. He said it \"hit the spot\" so I'll assume it was good. His fries were perfectly fried, it was crunchy served with a side of really good spicy mustard sauce. 

I had their chicken and beef kabob served over rice, hummus and my choice of wheat pita bread. I love love hummus with pita bread! Theirs were delicious. My kabobs were a bit salty on the bottom portion, I don't usually add salt to my food since I like to watch my sodium intake. My husband did bring to my attention that they had a protein section. I shall check that out next time. 

The server was nice and helpful.

The place was new and spotless.

Their prices aren't bad and their portion size is good.

Their interior is inviting and gives you that romantic vibe. It was nice and cool out for the month of May, we ate our food in their patio."}
{"text":"Great service selection first class yes it takes a while for your food because it's done right not fast food.Big props for the beer selection from all over the world can't wait to get back and try something different first time Filet Mignon unreal!!!"}
{"text":"This place makes ya want to eat healthy. The clean and friendly atmosphere let ya know it's gonna be good. The filet kebob with grilled veggies is so good it's a weekly staple. I was even at a catered event for my uncles 50th birthday to my delight it was Stephanos and it was flawless, every one there marveled at the amazing spread. Thank goodness for small places like this it makes my toes tap whenever I eat there. Just recently found out there  is no sugar added so the food is just that good with no corner cutting."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout. A combo plate with falafel, chicken shwrma hummus and Israeli salad with wheat pita. The food was ok o like to have my food made fresh not from a pre made supply for the day. That would be my main complaint. I could tell it wasn't cooked right then and there my order was ready within 5 minutes which tells it all. The chicken  would have been better if it was cooked fresh not reheated. I'll stick with Market Grille or that little place in Fremont street. I was trying to find a place close to my home"}
{"text":"I've eaten here quite a few times but never reviewed them. It is a middle eastern (Israeli so even better) casual restaurant with a wide variety of really good middle eastern food, wine and beer. Their gyros are amazing and as a no carb\"er\" it is a great place for lunch (albeit a bit pricy) I highly recommend if you like middle eastern food you try it. It is kind of like a Zabas-order at the register but they do bring the food to you."}
{"text":"I came here to have a quick lunch with my nerdy friend a student at UNLV.

I am a falafel lover so I ordered the falafel pita sandwich. The falafel balls were tasty but did not have that Wow factor. Tahini sauce was mild and accented the sandwich fine.

Pretty efficient for time crunching.

Prices are fair."}
{"text":"I Love this restaurant with a fiery passion! I always order the Greek salad and it's perfect every time! I also always order the rice because I'm pretty sure they might mix crack cocaine in it! Literally addicting! The rice has some sort of flavoring to it that makes it just heavenly!  I recommend this to anyone who wants a fantastic meal with a casual upbeat setting. They also offered this membership and you earn points for free meals and stuff like that, good idea for foodies!"}
{"text":"OMG the best food around!! Usually get the chicken kabobs and rice, tried the steak kabobs but too soft and mushy.  My dog loved those.  The hummus and pita  is great too!!  Will have to try all their other food too!! Can't beat the taste, though a little pricey, well worth it."}
{"text":"I love their hummus! I also ordered the steak kebab plate and was overwhelmed and really happy! The rice smelled so good, the steak was so soft, juicy and tasty! Top this off with onions and tomatoes. Plus place looks clean and comfortable to eat at, and staff are nice."}
{"text":"Great, quick Greek food. Reasonably priced. Nice, clean and modern. The cashier could have been more welcoming.  Not very friendly. Will return."}
{"text":"I came to this place to show my cuban boyfriend how great food we have in our area
I ordered a plate with steak and I said another one with shrimp. When I go to pick up my order I see that I got only the shrimp not the rice I asked the girl to fix and I tried to reach the counter to pay the difference. On my back the girl furious grabbed the shrimp from the plate and threw it in some rice. i asked to pay eventhough she asked me not to pay for it I asked the receipt because she didnt give it to me I see that I was charged for the whole plate Asked for the manager Stephano himself was there I complained about the bad attitude of the server and he didnt express any compassion with me The girl approached me with a look Like \"You cant do nothing to me!\" I asked why I was overcharger and sge said \"I can give you the 3.75 back!\" I said \"You should have done it before not now that I am complaining \" Is like she wanted to fool me Stephano not only stoped her from arguing with me but asked her to give me 4 dollar like trying to get rid of me The girl was giving me a look like I was he worse enemy and the owner not pleasant and greatful for his clients
I am not going here anymore even if you pay me"}
{"text":"Had the Gyro and it was great. I get cravings all the time now for it, and other places really fall short. The only thing I would change in my order is to NOT get the plate unless you're really hungry. The Gyro alone is big enough. They wrap it in 2 pitas. It's huge and will save you some money. Don't forget to check in and get a piece of baklava free. Great meal and I wish they were closer to east henderson.

If you do get the plate, it literally can feed 2 people easily.

Interesting decor. most of it is what you expect....tables and chairs but in the back is a very lush pillowed getaway if you're in the mood to lounge."}
{"text":"The beef & lamb gyro is the bomb dot com.  If that's all you order here, I promise you'll be happy.  The meat is deliciously charred, there's just the right amount of ingredients, and the sauce is flavorful without being overpowering.  Also, the gyro is the perfect size; you're not ridiculously hating-your-life-full afterwards.

The fries are yummy, nothing too spectacular, but yummy nonetheless.  And they have a delicious thousand island colored dipping sauce that's a must!

I checked in on Yelp and got my free baklava.  It was super delicious and again the perfect portion for me.  Plus, everything is reasonably priced.  The gyro, fries, and drink combo only set me back $10."}
{"text":"The waiters were very friendly, the food was delicious and the price was right. What more could you want?!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat. We've tried numerous items on the menu and have not had a complaint. The staff are all very friendly. My only :( on today's visit is that they ran out of their yummy pickled turnips!"}
