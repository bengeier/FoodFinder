{"text":"The food is great and the waitresses are always beautiful and friendly! There has been a lot of improvements over the years and you immediately take notice. I would recommend this place to anybody looking for superb mexican sea food!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, way over priced and rude staff.  Tried this place on a recommendation, but will not be returning. Expensive small tea that's over filled with ice and they don't do refills, salsa had no flavor, and the little soup cup they bring tastes like watered down canned tomato soup with some hot sauce dumped in it. Camarones ahogados were overbearing in seasoning and it looked like they had dumped half a bottle of salsa on it, couldn't even taste the shrimp, not to mention all the seafood was room temperature, Gross! The rice tastes like a box Parmesan rice mix and the molcajete was twice the price and half the size (no exaggeration) from every other place Ive ever had it.  No greeting when you enter, and staff looked like they hated being there. Left my empty drink on the edge of the table and waitress acted like it wasn't there for half the visit.  Did I mention they are WAY over priced!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, mediocre food. When you have to flag down the waitresses to get a drink 10 minutes after you are seated, then flag another one down to get chips.   Then you are not done eating and they clean around you and bring the bill right after. Then they sit right there and wait for you to sign your bill, you gotta be kidding me!! Never again!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Bad service mostly all of the waitresses don't know how to smile very stuck up after they serve your food they don't really come to your table to check up on refills or ext... and I been here several times with family. Place is small for the loud music they play on the weekend at night SORRY!!!! Only one start thanks to the waitresses"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and the food is just ok I think is over priced , Is too pricey for the type of food , the service SUCKS . They didn't greet me when I was at the door waited there for a wile before someone noticed me ,  the lady that was taking care of my table she went to lunch and she didn't even send someone to help us ,"}
{"text":"Over priced? In some dishes yes, but if you're crevice then you're definitely getting the more quantity for your buck. Quality is a whole different story. The shrimp ceviche tostada was lacking flavor, no matter how much salsa you l Pour on it. To make the whole experience worse I wasn't  informed by my waitress that the shrimp tacos came with some kind of Chipotle sauce instead of taco cream, which did not enhance the flavor of the taco whatsoever.  Boy was i wrong when I thought the whole experience couldn't get worse, I found myself spitting out shrimp shell and had to spit out the rest of the taco. It was not cute I would not recommend this place, specially for the price"}
{"text":"This is my new mariscos spot! I came here 2 days ago and the food and service was on point! I came here a year ago and didnt enjoy it that much but my most recent visit definately makes me want to go again, chips and salsa were fresh my waitress was friendly and knowledgeable, it was clean and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Terrible food + terrible service. I won't say much about my experience but its enough to never return."}
{"text":"Food is not that great. Very expensive they charge for ice tea refill. If you look that you don't have money the waitress will get back to you when you are ready for you check. Not recommended unless you drive a bad ass car and have money to throw to the waitress every time she gets close to you."}
{"text":"The food is really good & comes out very quickly. The service is okay, they arent very attentive but not a big deal. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is the service. My husband & I usually pay about $50-$60.."}
{"text":"We always come here if we want to eat mariscos.  It can be pricey but its good and have live band.  The service is good too."}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Cashier never smiled , she was pissed or something: got the fried fish and it had a blue plastic on it, she looks at it and says it's a piece from the tortillas bag! Then she asks what do you want me to do : I told her make another!! She's all pissed like it's my fault: my friend got the shrimp soup; cold and brings tortillas when almost done eating the few shrimps ; it was all soup no shrimp: bathrooms are tiny and no seat ! Never coming here again!!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp burrito.  Attentive staff, good sized portion, and the food was ready pretty fast."}
{"text":"The service was horrible I pretty much ate my food with nothing to drink when I asked for a refill waitress made it seem like I should of got up and done it myself..... I'm sorry u hate ur job but we all have to make a living don't bitch at the end of the night when u don't make much on ur tips.. \"Always smile cause u never knw who's day your making\".. But on other hands food was delicious so thumbs up for the cook"}
{"text":"Best marisco place in Phoenix. Great sea food and good Banda music. Place is clean and beer is always really cold."}
{"text":"Best Mexican seafood ever!!!! It's better to order for pick up since it gets really loud"}
