{"text":"When it comes to the food, that place is simply phenomenal. Simple menu and everything I had was simply delicious. That lamb pasta I had during Winterlicious was one of the best pasta dish I had in years and I came back a second the same week for that same dish. The seasoning on my octopus appetizer was to the point; it was spicy and the the orzo brought the perfect amount of umami to my meal. The dessert and appetizers were also very well made and portioned.   The space is industrial and lofty. Great for events but if you are looking for intimacy, It might not be the best venue.  I am curious to know where that chef learned to cook like this. His recipes are inspired and simply delicious.  The place is often reserved for event, call first to see if they are open to the public."}
{"text":"TO be honest, this place caught our attention only because we ditched the idea of going to El Catrin next door after reading a series of negative reviews of that place, plus our appetite had been worked up after walking around in the gloomy afternoon at the so-often visisted distillery district. But I gotta say Archeo served us well. With an austere food menu (but not so for the drinks), we were still able to order some really amazing food, like the risotto with a hint of tea leaf and sweetness, and the vegetable lasagne that had large slabs of mushroom in sophisticated layers. The friendly servers were attentive. Industrial Archaeology, they say, is the systematic study of material evidence associated with the industrial past. If my memory serves me right, the wall by the entrance had the term printed in Italian. I guess this place has somewhat made its relation with the industrial heritage of the whole district the theme of the restaurant. The loft style dining space offers a vast yet intimate experience with the space.  PS. I genuinely welcome the lavatory style restrooms at this place. Far as I know, only El Catrin next door and Salad King on Yonge boast such sumptuous treatment for their patrons."}
{"text":"Archeo is a great choice when looking for a place to dine in the Distillery District. Like many Torontoians I am simply enamored with the Distillery District all its offerings. But unfortunately I'm not made of money and I dine out a lot so I'm always on the look-out for something moderately affordable but still classy enough to feel like you're going 'somewhere.' Archeo is the first restaurant as you walk through the gates into the Distillery (which is accessible from Mill Street; go south on Parliament and turn left onto Mill Street). It is an Italian 'trattoria' as the name suggests with some outdoor seating at the front and a large lofty space on the inside. The decor is a little sparse for my taste--a little too industrial--but the space is nice and comfortable enough. The menu is small-ish with many excellent options; they feature only the best. They bring warm bread and balsamic vinagrette/oil to the table. I started with the soup of the day--butternut squash--and it was delightful ($8) thick and soupy, just as I like it. I had the margherita pizza as my main entree and make sure you add peperoni for the extra $2, its worth it and the pepperoni is really tasty. A girlfriend got the margherita but seemed a little bland (as I usually find margherita pizzas). My boyfriend ordered the Braised Rabbit Ragu with Orecchiette and it was really quite good, and surprisingly affordable ($14). I had a bite and I was impressed. Another friend had the Sweet Potato Pansotti which she thought was delicious but the serving was a little on the small-side, fill up on bread if you're inclined to order this dish (or good for those who aren't starving when they arrive at the resto).   The service was a highlight of this place--clearly seasoned servers who understand the value of treating customer king. Its not like I like to be pampered or anything but simply remembering orders, refilling water on the regular, remember who ordered what, and having no trouble splitting the bill (side note: don't you hate when waiters moan about splitting the bill; I mean they probably make more tips on seperate cheques anyways!). The guy-girl duo who was working the room took great care of us, and I appreciated it.   So if you're in the Distillery District or around in Corktown stop by this great little spot--with a great blend or modern-traditional cuisine in a great space. The prices are right (for the location!), the service is well honed, and you'll enjoy yourself, I promise."}
{"text":"My partner and I lucked out and got a seat here during the Winterlicious event! It was a delicious and reasonable meal where there was an appropriate amount of food per course (very hard to come across at other restaurants). Good salad starter, tasty fresh made pizza entree and a not so bad chocolate cannolis dessert. Wonderful service that was friendly, upbeat and efficient. We stuck around for awhile and took our time eating and felt no pressure at all. Everything was decent so if you're at the district, it's worth a visit, especially during Winterlicious!"}
{"text":"Great spot for an afternoon drink & snack on the flower drenched patio. I'm not sure how extensive the wines by the glass are as I had a one-track mind for Prosecco. The beer selection, while having a couple of decent options, was a bit flawed considering the history of the location (everything was imported, we were expecting more local microbrew).   As to food, we were just in for a snack so we split the strawberry goat cheese salad. We declined bread when asked, but our server brought it anyways and when the salad arrived we knew why he had - it's not a strawberry & goat cheese salad, it's a strawberry-goat cheese salad (with delicious pickled sweet onions and fresh spinach). This was one of the few instances in which \"cheese with stuff in it\" (as my cheesemonger friend says) was acceptable (more than acceptable) , the portion of cheese was massive and we were happy for the delicious nutty wheat rolls.   Our server was delightful, chatty & entertaining. Unfortunately his chattiness resulted in very slow service, the missing star is for that and the poor selection of beer."}
{"text":"Great evening, even on a Monday.  Carrie was terrific with service for dinner and drinks. Appetizers we had the (1)arugula salad with goat cheese  (2) Grilled Calamari  Terrific taste of both.  Entrees were enjoyed (1) Quinoa salad, excellent portion and taste (2) Salmon on a bed of oyster mushrooms, prepared fantastic and again great portion size. I would definitely recommend this restaurant, believe me, I have walked out of some restaurants in the city due to unable to accommodate my wife's allergies(despite calling ahead to ensure it was ok).    This place we will go again. Thank you for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Archeo for Summerlicious 2015. When we showed up, the restaurant was about half full so it was a very nice and quiet time. Our server took our drink order and brought us our drinks very quickly. We were starving, so we ordered our food quickly in the hopes that the appetizers would be out very soon. I had the poached arctic char salad, linguini alla amitriciana, and the creme brulee and my wife had the caesar salad, pan seared atlantic salmon, and creme brulee. It took about 15 to 20 minutes before we received our appetizers even when the restaurant was not busy at all. The arctic char salad was delicious and was not fishy at all and the caesar salad was pretty standard. Once we finished off our appetizers, our mains came out about 10 minutes later. My wife's atlantic salmon and fingerling potatoes were very good but the sauteed spinach was a little oversalted. The pork hock in my amitriciana was the best meat I've had in a while but the sauce and pasta was just okay. By the time dessert was brought out, we were pretty much stuffed. I tried the creme brulee and it was perfect. The espresso bits inside made it that much better.  Overall, it was a decent experience but the wait staff wasn't very attentive and the kitchen seemed very slow for a Tuesday evening with only half the restaurant full."}
{"text":"Summerliscious 2013  For $15 meal?! Sumptuous. I love it. Love their decor inside but opt for patio. Food: good portions, good  taste, great ambiance,  good service. We were full! Our server was kind enough to give us kiddies appetizer to share for the kids instead of their summerliscious appetizer. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We had a small Sunday brunch wedding at Archeo, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone else planning a similar event. There are cheaper venues around, but we didn't regret the extra money. The space is beautiful, the staff are really great at what they do, and the food was fantastic.  The planning process wasn't perfect - we had to request some things more than once - but on the day the staff on site were just incredibly competent and accommodating. We didn't have a wedding planner or really anyone else who could deal with the venue, and I was a bit worried that we would spend all morning making sure everything was going smoothly, but instead they really looked after us, even bringing out the food early when we got a bit ahead of schedule, making sure I got a cup of coffee, etc. I wish all customer service was this top notch."}
{"text":"We came for dinner during Summerlicious, and I understand that portions are sometimes a little smaller with the set menus. The 3 course meal was delicious but the portions were absolutely tiny! The appetizer and dessert were two-bite sized. I was still very hungry when I left the restaurant, and I am not a big person. My husbands meal was a little better - I would say that his meal was 4 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent patio seating. It's stunning venue if you like the modern rustic look.  Their Summerlicious menu was excellent for a $15 lunch.  The smoked pork sholder quiche was suprising good.  Their bread was soft and still warm."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. The apps (Octopus and fritters) were tasty. Wasn't happy with my sausage pizza. They ran out of three other entrees at about 7:30pm. Staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The best that I can say about this place is that whomever designed the inside had really good taste in art. Whoever cooks the food is clueless about how to make a delicious dish. Everything was bland, boring and uninspired. Whoever hired the waiters and hostess doesn't have any idea about the scope of their staff's duties. I shouldn't have to feel like a pain in the ass asking to order or get more water or receive the bill.  This place sucks. Spend your money on other restaurants in the Distillery."}
{"text":"No. Just no.  I'm amazed by the glowing reviews on here. I don't know if it was a full moon or what but our brunch experience here was one of the worst dining experiences of our lives!  We were lured in by the buffet coupled with the opportunity to sit outside on a beautiful day. It was the worst mistake of life.   We were seated outside, the hostess was really pleasant and quickly cleaned off a table for us. We were told that a server would be with us in a minute so we waited patiently. Our server walked by our table many times without ever acknowledging us in any way, we figured there was no way he could even be our server. After about 15 minutes he mentioned that he would be right over as he passed by us. As a former server/bartender I have a really high tolerance level as I know what it's like to have a lot of tables sit at once or a demanding large group. We spent a lot of time watching this guy and there was zero reason for things to have started this way and it only got worse. Also, it's a buffet - you aren't handling the food at all! He had someone topping up coffees/water and helping to clear tables - what?  After finally ordering drinks we ventured into the buffet. Not the end of the world but it would be really handy to have some kind of place cards on the covered containers so your customers aren't needlessly opening and closing every dish.   We grabbed a couple of plates and they were super dirty. Not, \"oh you missed a spot\" kind of dirty....a large black thing stuck to the front of one (bigger than a toonie) and a pile of come kind of dairy product on the other. After picking through the entire stack we had to find someone to bring out more - there wasn't a single clean one.  We get back to our table, finish our plates and our drinks still haven't arrived. When they finally do he hasn't brought the water or cream/sugar for the coffees. He says he'll be right back and after 5 minutes we go in and ask another (very helpful) server to get them for us.   After seeing the chunks floating in our water we decide that one plate of food in this place was enough and it was time to get the heck out of dodge. Getting the bill is equally painful, the best part of the entire thing was leaving.   We will never be back and I can't imagine trusting this place to run a special event."}
{"text":"Sadly there aren't enough choices to eat in the Distillery when the Food Truck Festival isn't on. My DC and I had a gift certificate to Boiler House or Archeo and we chose Archeo for the lower prices.  The décor of the restaurant is excellent. Very modern, minimal, \"lofty\" concrete-and-wood with Toronto-themed art. Although it might feel a bit stuffy at first because of the location and menu prices it actually has quite a relaxed vibe.  Our waitress was new and didn't know how to open the wine we ordered with a standard corkscrew. It didn't bother us at all and lightened the mood, but be aware of that sort of service bothers you.  Everything was going along smoothly, but I found the food simply average. We started with the phyllo wrapped brie, which was delicious, but not really a culinary secret. For mains we had the duck confit pizza and the roasted pork tenderloin. The pizza was lacking in duck and the tenderloin looked better than it tasted. For dessert we had the canoli, the best part of which was the memories of much better canolis I had in NYC.  Overall it's not a bad dining experience, but I expected above average food and didn't get it."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had our first date here and we keep going back!  We like the atmosphere, especially during the quieter times we were there.  It can get quite noisy when busy (as with any restaurant of course) but that's minor. The food has always been great, albeit a tad expensive but we expect that for this area.  And we can't say enough about the staff.  Each time we've been there we were greeted with a warm smile, and the servers were always on top of things. We make it a priority to go during Winterlicious every year to try whatever dishes they're offering and we're never disappointed. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good ambience but the options available for alternate diets like Vegas or those with allergies is really limited. The prices are a bit expensive but factor in this is a really touristy area."}
{"text":"Due to the good reviews,  we decided to have lunch here on August 11, 2015.  Very nice ambiance.   Server was fine, however the food was hit and miss.   My husband enjoyed his lemon linguini vongole and my daughters said their pizzas were okay,  however,  the gnocchi was awful.  My food was luke warm when it arrived and sitting in a watery sauce.   Everything about the dish was awful- the chicken and the mushroom were bland and tasted water logged,  the gnocchi was seasoned with herbs but not tasty.   I didn't finish most of the meal.   Disappointing."}
{"text":"We got married here two years ago.   We used the patio for the ceremony and had the reception inside.  We were able to customize the menu to all Canadian dishes and the distillery nervous was fantastic.  We set up an open bar and paid per drink which was the right choice since our family aren't big drinkers.   The food was tremendous and the people who came, still talk about it after all this time. The service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Went here with two friends one evening after the Christmas market. The interior is beautiful, I only wish they made better use of it. But the main point was that the service and food were very disappointing. Or server never came to check on us or our food or wine levels- he was totally mia. We had to order from the bus boy who didn't seem to know much. The pasta tasted like grocery store boxed noodles- and at that price point I would expect much better. We also had to ask for Parmesan since it wasn't offered. A total lack of service and I could have made better food myself. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed and downright disappointed with the meal offerings for a vegan.   The service and servers were amazing. The opening salad was very nice, lovely presentation and tastey. However, then my main arrived:  few small pieces of cooked vegetables scattered amongst a measly bowl of rice with a hint of curry paste and a piece of papadum standing upright. How can any trained chef think this is a solid meal?  I say this was a fail! Not vegan friendly.  Follow up: The restaurant responded advising me to let them know \"in the moment\" of any disappointments. My issue with that response is that it is very uncomfortable to complain in the presence of other dinner guests. While perhaps there is little that can be done after the fact, and I should be grateful that my review and experience was acknowledged, I stand behind my original comment that the chef should know better. Upon further thought, the restaurant could just accept  a failing and say they will consider a change.  Again, not a good spot for a vegan."}
{"text":"Went here on a business lunch with co-workers for a holiday treat and appreciation.  It was fantastic!  Although we got lost finding the restaurant, once we were able to locate it what a nice place to have discovered.  (Note to people who are looking, the restaurant is just to the left inside the main gate - we were blinded by the people taking down the Xmas fair decorations and missed the sign)  There were 4 of us and we were well attended to.  They have a coat check in the front which is a nice touch so you don't have to drag your coat around and hang on the back of your chair.  We ordered appetizers, and remarked at the variety of interesting foods from rabbit ragout, to duck confit.  The appetizers we ordered were escargot, and baked brie wrapped in filo pastry.   The escargot is divine as it is in a cheese and butter sauce and piled on top of a roll that's been cut out and the escargot sit in it.  For lunch we all ordered differently.  The pasta isn't too big for lunch, even if the waitress says it's huge.  The pizza however is too big if you are ordering an appetizer.  Of our party we had the rabbit ragout pasta, the mushroom pasta, the pepperoni pizza, and the duck confit pizza.  I had the duck and it was delish!  I would love to go again one day.  I really enjoyed this restaurant and the service was fantastic.  She was attentive and helpful with our questions."}
{"text":"Didn't love the food. It wasn't authentic Italian food but rather different unique maybe fusion like. The only saving grace was the kids loved their meals. And the wine list lacked lustre.  what Italian restaurant doesn't have any Italian wine on the menu. So strange. It was disappointing for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day Brunch.  The decor of the restaurant is beautiful but the food was just ok.  The brunch set up is in the middle of the room and the tables are kind of crowded together along the sides.  Perhaps because the brunch there doesn't seem as busy as other places (Hot House), food tends to sit longer and gets an unappetizing look.  I think my favourite part of brunch was the dessert.  They had a strawberry angel food cake, it was like eating a cloud!  (Or at least my idea of what a cloud would taste like lol) They also had little jars of what looked like strawberry rhubarb crumble, chocolate cake and little heart shaped cake pops dipped in chocolate with the word 'mom' written on the front, nice touch.  The service was good and our server checked on our table often with prompt tea/coffee refills but it's highly unlikely I would return here for brunch."}
{"text":"The food was ok. The recommend special was dry and excessively crunchy. Our waitress shame blamed my friend for not mentioning a peanut allergy. She, in her own defence, vehement claimed that there was explicit mention of nuts on the menu. She embarrassed all of us. We went home with our tails between ours legs and looked up the menu only to see that was no mention of nuts on her meal choice (the steak).  The acoustics were ok."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious recently and was not impressed. The pasta (papperdelle alla puntanesca) had a very odd taste to it; the capers with the anchovies gave it a really overwhelming salty/bitter taste. The margherita pizza was just okay, I've had better. The only highlight of the 3 course meal was the white chocolate ricotta cheesecake. Overall, a subpar restaurant experience given its location."}
{"text":"At maybe 50% capacity on a Saturday night, I'm wondering if this is the norm or cause of the winter wetness that it ain't so busy.  The PIADINI flatbread comes with fries with black garlic aoili or house salad. The feature of the day was a Genoa salami with mushrooms, mozzarella, and some hot peppers. Flatbread was crisp at advertised by our server and toppings not bad but overall on the dry side. The garlic aoili was bomb though and made for a nice dip for both the piadini and thick cut fluffy fries.  The PAPARDELLE BOLOGNESE was nice and saucy with a hefty amount of meat in the sauce, and a nice hit of basil and juicy tomatoes throughout. The fried anchovy was nice but sat ontop of the dish, whole, so if you didn't think to ration it over the course the dish, you'd end up with a big salty hit of fish. Pasta excellently al dente.  Another member of our group ordered the FLATIRON which seemed to be a surprisingly small portion. Described on the menu as \"Potato Tostones, Crème Fraiche, Beet, Juniper, Glace De Veau\", my allergic-to-peanuts friend did not expect to have to ask about nut content of the dish. To our surprise, the steak came on a bed of beet puree, with a side of potatoes... dusted with ground pistachios. She asked the server whether the dish had any peanuts and was met with a curt response, \"there's pistachios, it was on the menu\". Definitely not impressed with this kind of customer service, particularly when no comment nor request was made on our end. Checking back now on the actual description of the dish, the server was clearly flat out wrong and rude.   Overall the pasta is the only redeeming factor for this place but given all the other choices in the distillery, I probably won't be back soon."}
{"text":"Tried to have lunch on the patio at 2pm. We were told that the place was packed (by the hostess) and that we could have drinks right off, but that food would take about 30 minutes to get to us. Ok, we settled in and decided to wait it out.   After sitting down, the waitress told us the wait would be an hour. We let her know that the hostess said otherwise, but she didn't have a comment for it. Fine, given that they said it was busy, and the weekend, and we didn't feel like getting in another line elsewhere, we settled...again.  Meanwhile, the other patrons on the patio were eating, and we weren't given an answer to our question as to why they could eat and not us. I had to assume that these patrons also waited an hour, since the waiter wouldn't say.  Half hour goes by and food is streaming out of the kitchen. I decided to go inside to see how busy it was. IT WAS LESS THAN HALF FULL. The patio by this time, was also less than half full, but the food restriction was still on.  Then the waitress came out to proceed to tell us the specials of the day. Why the hell would you do this, knowing that the patrons can't eat what your offering? Was this to help quell the hunger pains? Or cause more?   After a half hour, we pushed back, stating everything above. Suddenly, they offered a burger and fries that would be 6-8 minutes. It actually took 25, but I cut them even more slack.  Then the waiter comes by  to check up. \"Wasn't it worth waiting for??\" Holy s**t. You gotta be kidding! \"Dude, do you know a burger anywhere that you would wait 1.5 hours for? Seriously?\" Look, I had to be frank. I think sometimes staff stay stupid crap without thinking, simply because they feel it's expected of them. Personally, I feel dumb questions should get a dumb answer.   Never coming back. This was my 3rd attempt to eat there. The first 2 attempts were blocked by private events. Totally done with this place. Go to the Boiler House or Tappas if you need to eat at the Distillery District. Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"This place is lovely for an event. The interior is beautiful and has a authentic meets modern look to it. Inside there is a mix of wood and stone and glass as a design. They offer a wide selection of drinks. Pricing can range from high end of affordable to expensive depending of how much you drink and eat. It is tucked away in the distillery district so it is mainly Accessible by walking or bus."}
{"text":"A cute place at the Distillery District to enjoy a good meal with friends. We booked a large table and got seated right in the middle, which was sort of perfect for us until we started socializing. Apparently, the aisles are a bit tight, so we got bumped several times by servers while talking to guests.   Service was up and down - food and drinks came at a great pace, but the bill took an extremely long time and required a few follow-up clarifications (and we were all pretty antsy at that point as we all parking that was expired).   Food here is delicious though. The pizzas are great, the risotto is fantastic, and the sandwiches are a great deal (comes with soup or salad).   Love the bathrooms here too, individual stalls and they're oh-so-clean!   Would I come here again? Not quite yet - there are so many places in this area I need to try before I can make a truly informed decision as to whether this place is awesome or not. I'll fill you guys in later!"}
{"text":"We went during Winterlicious and I just have to say they were amazing! I ate at about 5 restaurants during that 2 week span and they were the best with their customer service and they didn't skimp on the portions either, which I noticed restaurants did. The Muscles were amazing, the deserts were great, and the main courses were delightful too! Only reason they didn't receive a 5 is because they forgot about us for 20 minutes and failed to take our order at the beginning and I had to re-order another 20 minutes after ordering due to them running out of the ingredients for my meal. I was a little bummed because I'm lactose intolerant and needed to completely alter my re-order, but it was still delicious. The server also seemed apologetic and sincere for the minor bumps so it didn't interfere with our experience very much. I almost gave them a 5 but had to give a 4 due to the bumps in the road. ;)"}
{"text":"Where to start ! 1- the smell of the place is very bad 2- chairs are not clean, even the utensils  3- the food isn't great that u would overlook the uncleanliness"}
{"text":"I came here with friends after attending the Christmas Market in the Distillery District last month and I will definitely be back!   I absolutely loved the interior. The space is evocative of a trendy art gallery with its open concept, high ceilings, and enormously framed pictures. The food was delicious! My friends and I shared the bruschetta to start and it was very fresh and flavourful. I opted for the burger and fries. The burger was medium rare, juicy, and tender. Our server recommended the fries, which were also very good.   Service was exceptional. Our energetic server had a lot of suggestions for us and made sure we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"Shot a wedding here. The food was amazing the patio great and the service exceptional!   First off I was totally excited to have a wedding at the Distillery. I mean it's just such a fantastic spot for photos!  I had a chance to chat with some of the staff and most of them are artists, actors and/or models trying to pick up some cash while looking to score their next big hit. That being said, there was nothing cocky about their service, they were friendly, genuine and never seemed annoyed by requests.    The decor is great and perfect for an intimate wedding, with a great patio for the ceremony or just the cocktail hour.   And the food? Well that deserves a 5 stars just by itself! Perfectly cooked and seasoned, to where you have no need to add any more salt (being a salt addict this is a big award)"}
{"text":"The food was a 3.  The overall experience was a 4.  We split two pizzas--the blanco and the grilled chicken.  Both were tasty, though we were surprised that neither had pizza/tomato sauce, and I like chewy crusts and these were crunchy.  Still, excellent tastes and creative toppings.  The local lager was delicious.  The ambiance is SO nice!  It's a beautiful setting--great for an occasion meal.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"While the service was slow and the room cool because of change in weather, it was worth waiting for as the food was fabulous.  Our party of six had soup of the day (tomato), chicken pizza and eggs Bennie brunch and we all commented it was very good."}
{"text":"Brought my girlfriend here for her birthday and was not disappointed. Atmosphere is a 5/5. Really nice spot for a date. Really cool gallery feel inside. Food 4/5. Small menu but the food was well done. Prices were reasonable. Wine menu was great."}
{"text":"I went here over the holidays, after having read many good reviews on yelp!   Archeo is in the distillery district, right off the main gate. Once inside we were greeted and our coats hung for us. It was not very busy inside, a handful of people. I love the decor, modern fused with the historical beauty of the building. We were seated near the window (drafty! could improve on their insulation) and our waiter came by to greet us. She was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. I ordered the Cobb salad, and my friend the french onion soup and rabbit pasta (that is not the name of this dish on the menu btw, but my best recollection of what he had).   I loved my salad. It was a mixed Cobb, with pieces of chicken, grilled corn, thick bacon chunks, greens, tomatoes, blue cheese, yummy yummy yummy. Zesty lemon based dressing set it off. Its on the appetizer menu but easily could be a main course (I didnt even finish my salad, it was a big serving size).  I tried my friends french onion soup, it had a huge dollop of cheese on top! whooee if you love melted cheese, this is for you! The soup part itself was flavored well. Also tried his rabbit pasta...very good. I rarely eat rabbit, but I would say it didnt have any particular taste to it, just tasted like...meat.  I really enjoyed this restaurant. It would be more fun (not to mention more warm!) with a larger crowd. Given that, the food was excellent and I will return to try other dishes on the menu. I love restaurants that offer some type of creativity to their menu's!  I noticed this place has been given $$$ price ratings. I wouldnt say its overly expensive. Our meal came to...$50-60 tax/tip incl, including a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Italian food doesn't have anything in common with this restaurant.  Although the restaurant itself is nicely decorated and service is good, the food is bad (lightly stated).  I ordered mushroom soup and I got black water with kale only.  I didn't eat it.  The right thing they did, they didn't include it in our bill.  They have to do something about their food!!!"}
{"text":"Most Memorable Feature: Honest servers  Came here on a double date for summerlicious dinner.  We had very friendly and honest servers who weren't afraid to admit when they weren't able to describe items on the menu.  They also went the extra mile and admitted when they inaccurately described items and appropriately apologized for the misunderstanding.  Food quality exceeded my expectations! Definitely great value for the price! All of us left feeling quite satisfied with the food.  Would come here again!  Dishes ordered: fazzoletti (handkerchief pasta), p.e.i. mussels, caramelle (house made pasta), calamaro (stuffed squid), chocolate fondue, affogato, raspberry sorbet"}
{"text":"I like the open concept of the dining room. There was a lot of space between tables and it is refreshing to eat at a restaurant in Toronto where you are not touching elbows with the people next to you.  We came on a Wednesday night during the christmas market. The restaurant had other customers but it was by no means \"busy\"   We ordered our food, and the appetizer and drinks came out promptly. Afterwards we waited an additional 35 minutes for our mains to show up. People around us who arrived after us started getting their food, and our mains still haven't arrived. The server did come by the table to say the mains will be right out.....ten minutes, then 15 minutes passed and the mains still hadn't arrived.  We ordered the striped bass and Hangar steak. When we finally did receive them my fish was hot, but the steak was luke warm at best. It looked like it was sitting out for a while hanging around.  Our guess is they messed up the fish or forgot it or didn't realize they had to cook it until after the steak was finished. Not sure what the remedy for a situation like this would be, but i do feel like it should have been addressed at some point during our meal.  The food was ok...but not good enough for us to be dying to go back."}
{"text":"Totally loved the experience here.  We stopped in with no resos- and even though we waited 45 mins for a table - ( it was a full night due to the Christmas market). the servers and wait staff totally made it ok.   They offered us snacks and water while we waited! When we sat down, the food was amazing - I had the seared ricotta gnocchi with smoked chicken.      The only weak point was the $8 carpaccio, which was only slice.   Otherwise, It was a great experience. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, and both times were for organized events where the entire space was rented out.  It's in the Distillery District, which is one of my favourite, picturesque areas of Toronto.  The decor was simple and rustic.  It's a decent size space as well perfect for about 100-120 people and a large dance floor or stage area.  The bathrooms are at the side too - love private bathrooms - so you don't have to walk through the stage area if something is going on.  They have a nice size patio as well when it's nice out.  The staff were great, and the food was excellent!  I would come back here on a regular day to try it for sure.  For the wedding they had a good variety of midnight snacks as well."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Service: 3/5 Location: 5/5  Nestled in the Distillery District, Archeo gives off a modern, yet rustic vibe. It's described as an urban loft with modern and historic appeal and I couldn't agree more. Due to its location, it is more on the expensive side, but it still won't break the bank.   I ordered the lemon linguini vongole with clams and I loved it! You can never go wrong with citrus and seafood and the pasta sauce was perfectly creamy. For dessert we ordered the tiramisu crème brulee and never looked back. The crème brulee was executed perfectly and the little biscuits they included on the side were a delicious touch.  Archeo is a great choice for a romantic date. The Distillery is especially beautiful during the holiday season when they have the Christmas village up and running."}
{"text":"Archeo has been an old standby whenever I'm in the Distillery District. I still remember years ago when Archeo and Boiler House were the only sit-down restaurants at 55 Mill Street! Although there are now plenty more options, I still like Archeo and find it to be pretty consistent.   Starting with the location, it's right off the main gates, so very easy to find and convenient. The space is minimalist and rustic, very open and relaxed yet still fancy-ish. It makes sense that it is a popular venue for weddings and other private events. On that note, I have come here in the summer several times only to find that it is closed for an event, so do keep that in mind (or better yet, make a reservation on opentable!). The one thing that I think is out of place and detracts from the atmosphere is the TV playing CP24 in the corner. Just unnecessary and placed in an almost hidden location that I doubt anyone except for staff ever watches it.   One of my favourites from their menu was the ricotto gnudi, which were cheesy and light like clouds. However, it is sadly no longer on the menu. The sandwiches make for a yummy lunch, although currently the sandwich choices are only a turkey club or a burger. On my last visit, my DC and I decided to share a salad and a pizza. I remember their pizzas being really big, so this was a good decision! We had the roasted vegetable pizza, which has mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, zucchini and mozzarella with tomato sauce. It was fresh and flavourful. Their crust is nice and soft, although you might not like that if you prefer a thinner, crispier crust like at Terroni or Libretto. We also had the arugula and bosc pear salad. The portion was generous and the vinaigrette just light and delicate.   Service is considerate and gracious. On my last visit, our server was very mindful that we had to catch a show at the Young Centre for the Performing Arts, and brought extra dishes since we were sharing.   Overall, Archeo is a nice place for a laid-back pre-theatre meal and in the summer, the stunning patio is a prime spot for relaxing with some vino."}
{"text":"This is a really nice restaurant, I'm not sure how we've missed it all the times we've been to the Distillery. Super friendly staff and great with kids. We were two couples with a toddler each. Both kids loved their meals, and we did too. Dessert was yummy too. Would definitely return. #distillerytoronto #torontoeats #barleelounge"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but nothing really stood out. The staff was polite and friendly but the whole place seemed a bit disoriented and unorganized. The space of the restaurant didn't seem fully utilized. I was expecting a better design, it seemed like they could have fit many more tables. The menu was also very small. We had the soup of the day, and two pastas, the food seemed quite homemade, but as I said before it wasn't anything memorable.   Food also took a bit longer than I expected. Overall, great location. But honestly I wouldn't go back again. Next time I would prefer roaming the food stalls of the Christmas market that was going on nearby"}
{"text":"Meh. The menu's pretty uninspired. There are better restaurants in the distillery, and there's better Italian to be had in Toronto."}
{"text":"My mother loves to make me responsible for choosing restaurants for birthday celebrations. My parents also LOVE brunch buffets. There aren't too many in the city so, I figured why not give Archeo a try. We were able to make reservations which is always a bonus when it's brunch.  Our 11:30 reservations got us a choice of where we wanted to sit in the spacious and not super busy restaurant, so we wound up on the patio under the shady umbrella.   Just a heads up that the the tables are really small and we had to do a bit of juggling between glasses and plates to make room for everything.  Let's talk about the food for a second. The buffet table is in the center of the room. There are about 6 chafing trays filled with a variety of food including standard breakfast fare. Lots of selection, sadly most of it was cold or lukewarm.   They also had roast beef and peameal bacon sitting under a hot lamp which wasn't super appetizing. There was the requisite make your own omelet bar which I didn't try but it looked yummy from what I saw on my dining companion's plate.   I found the layout confusing having to circle back to get condiments for toast. Also, the dessert table was right in the sunlight and the pastries started looking sadder and sadder as the sun shone through and the plates got emptier.   Needless to say, the food was delicious, at $20 including coffee or tea per person it's quite the bargain. Our server was also fairly attentive bringing coffee and water refills constantly.  At this price for this variety, I'm willing to let the few deltas slide for many repeat visits."}
{"text":"After walking awhile in the Christmas market it was already 8, so we just randomly chose Arheo for dinner since it is just located in the Distillery District. The menu is very simple and doesn't have that much variety to choose from. I ordered the flat iron which comes with two tiny potatoes. The steak is really tender and juicy, but the portion is quite small (my friend just finished it in 5 mins). Overall, it is great but probably you need to order more dishes to be full."}
{"text":"Archeo is easy to miss when you are visiting the Distillery District and not specifically looking for it - even though it is right at the main gate entrance to the district, the exterior of this restaurant is so low key that it can easily be mistaken as a gift/clothing shop of some kind. If you do give them a try, you'll find that it is quite a solid restaurant with very reasonable prices given it's at a touristy location.  The restaurant has a casual, rustic Italian Trattoria look and feel to it. Service is prompt and delightful. Unlike other restaurants in the area, this place does not have a huge menu selection, but it is well-rounded and thoughtful. With me and 3 other companions, we were able to sample pretty much all of the appetizers and most of the secondi main dishes.  The food here is contemporary Italian, so anyone who comes here expecting to taste classic home style Italian cooking would probably be disappointed. Presentation of the dishes here are great, and I found the flavours very interesting.  Dishes we had for the evening:  - Antipasti with local & house cured meats, housemade pickles, ferments, mustard and cracker - Cannelloni with Chianti braised rabbit, charred carrot puree, and burnt cucumber infusion - Fresh local greens with house ricotta and elderberry caper - Fritto Misto (Maitake mushroom, olive ascolone, dandelion and burnt cucumber emulsion) - Flatiron steak with potatoes, creme fraiche, beet, juniper and glace de veau (this was perfectly seared and was an absolute joy to eat) - Fazzoletti Ripieni with house made Italian sausage, seared Ontario mushrooms, fennel, kumquat and anise truffle nage (this was an awesome dish as well) - Farfelle with rapini, vanilla poached salsify, shallots, garlic confit, garlic pesto cream and preserved lemon - Pappardelle Bolognese with blisted vine tomatoes, white anchovies and smoked olive oil (my favourite pasta of the evening) - Branzino with pan fried sweet gale, crispy skin, brussel sprouts, dandelion greens and elderberry piccata - Piadini Manzo with beef bresaola, sunchoke puree, green olive, pistachio, smoked golden blyth goat gouda (much more interesting and tastier than a pizza!) - Apple cake with brown butter icecream and marsala cream (this was so good, especially the brown butter icecream!) - Vanilla buttermilk panna cotta  - Bittersweet chocolate bar with cocoa nibs, raspberry sorbet and strawberry coulis (a very nice and balanced dessert)  I truly appreciate Executive Chef Dyer's passion of trying to focus on using as much local ingredients as possible for his dishes. I was also delighted to know that most things are made/prepared in-house, which is always nice.  Overall, I am definitely a fan of this place and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone visiting the Distillery District who wants to try good and reasonably priced Italian fare. Archeo is a popular event spot and could be closed for a private event, so reservations are highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch this past weekend... AWFUL AWFUL SERVICE!!! The food was decent, but man I can't stress enough how bad the service was. The hostesses were pleasant and were kind enough to take out coats... but things went downhill very quickly after.  Our waiter didn't appear until 30 minutes after we had helped ourselves to the buffet style brunch. He was cold, and seemed uninterested in his job. While making their rounds, they constantly ignored our corner of the room, leaving us with piles of dirty plates and empty coffee mugs.  Near the end of our meal, I witnessed the floor manager approach the table of 6 beside us, and ask them to leave because the \"next reservation had arrived\". Completely unprofessional and EMBARASSING.  Once the party had left, i overheard the two waiters cleaning up Complaining about how some people \"really can't take a hint\".  Our waiter finally cracked a smile when handing us the bill, expecting some sort of a tip from us... Get real  UNREAL. so incredibly disappointed. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and will let as many people know my terrible experience here."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service.  We usually go to other resturant on the main stripe.  We suddenly discover this resturant when we had coffee in bricks bakery.  The food is canadian.  We ordered pizza and a beef tenderloin as main course.  The pizza was interesting with new combination.  Fries come with the pizza wasn't too good but not bad.  The beef tenderloin was cooked in the right doness but the portion is quit small."}
{"text":"The staff at Archeo Trattoria were fantastic in planning our wedding at their venue. The industrial beauty of the restaurant was exactly what we were looking for. Other than the groom, the most important part of my wedding was the food. Archeo ran the dinner like a regular restaurant, with each guest getting a menu, so I didn't have to fuss with everyones preferences beforehand. The food was delicious and the most restaurant quality food I had experienced at a wedding. The side patio was a great place to have cocktails and lounge after dinner. My guests say that one of the highlights of the night was the amazing bartender, who remembered everyones drinks and kept them flowing all night.   If you are looking for a modern wedding in an unconventional space, this is the place."}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  we dined here as a part of a private party / large group (apx. 80 of us) and did not have the ability to select from the regular menu.  Due to the challenges involved serving a group that size I'm adding a half of a star to what would have otherwise been a 2.5.   Pros:  Atmosphere - the Distillery is an interesting pedestrian-only brick area that had live entertainment in the street (another private party complete with go-go dancers and techno music), it filled up with club-dress wearing 20-somethings by the time we were leaving.    The interior is charming from the walls up (see other reviews for detail), but the cement floor needs ....needs....SOMEthing.... just not cement.    Staff - very attentive, no downtime, excellent bartender - looking for the next customer while remembering/serving your 3 drink orders.    Outside patio - the couch area was intimate yet perfect for people watching.  Creme Brulee - I'm a creme brulee NUT - this was the 2nd best I've ever had...the first being at a  tiny restaurant in Vail, CO.   Cons - the appetizers were inedible (lamb, mini-burgers, spicy chicken), the dinner salmon was bland and overcooked, the dinner tenderloin was anything but tender and overcooked.  Overall - if you're a family looking for a nicer place to take the kids, I would try it.  If you're a foodie - not so much."}
{"text":"Could be good. Nobody knows for sure as they are very very rarely open to the public. I have lived in the Distillery for over 3 years and every time I tried to go there they were closed for a private function. Treat this as a wedding venue and not a restaurant."}
{"text":"This review is based on my experience during Summerlicious 2014.  I love the location right inside Distillery District. As I can walk around a little, go for a drink after or just hang out.  Making reservation using Opentable is just super convenient.   Summerlicious $25 Dinner  First Course:  - Classic Caesar - Grilled Calamari Sofrito  Second Course: - Penne Arribiata with Ricotta Salata - Grilled Salmon  Third Course: - Red Wine Poached Pear and Mascarpone Tart - Tiramisu with Red Wine Cherry Compote  The food was solid and the portion was generous. I enjoyed most of the item aside from the dessert which were so so.  Service was excellent and attentive even during \"Licious\" Restaurant week.  There is also a really nice patio, maybe not be as buzzing as other patios in the area but if you want some quiet time, this seems to be a much better choice.  Archeo is worth coming back if you enjoy good Italian food and some quiet time with your friends!"}
{"text":"We went during the Christmas market and therefore we could enter the market without paying. That was starting great.  We enter and we are surprised by the large place in this old factory. Decoration is sober but made with good taste.  Waitress are really nice.  The choice is not that large but the selection is great.  Prices are correct."}
{"text":"Very sophisticated place, onde of the best italian food ever tried! The pasta with fungi was amazing! Very good place to celebrate a special occasion with someone special!"}
{"text":"Came with girlfriends and sat outside at patio for a glass of wine and also tried the beets soup. Our server, Carrie, was super sweet. Would recommend based on the good service!"}
{"text":"Decent food and friendly service.  We came as a group of 6 for Summerlicious, some of us ran late and they were very accommodating. They served the perfect focaccia bread, crispy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside. The fazzoletti was good, but by the time it reached our table it was cold. The pappardelle bolognese was my main entree, it was good but nothing special. The stuffed calamaro tasted fresh and light, however the portion was so small it should have been listed as an entree. They ended up messing up our dessert orders, but made up for it with complementary raspberry sorbet. It was delicious and so rich you can taste the berries.   Overall a pleasant experience, but I probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"Went here for a wedding on a Saturday, and thought it was great. I can't comment on this place when it's a regular restaurant, but for a wedding I enjoyed it.    The decor is not stuffy, which I liked, but also not too casual.  Lots of brick.  The outside area is a little dangerous for those wearing heels (I think one girl took a spill), as the bricks are very uneven and your heel will constantly get stuck in the dirt.  That said, if you know how to walk properly in heels you should be able to fare decently.  The outside decor wasn't anything special, but for an outside ceremony it was fine.  I think they could setup a nicer tent though, the one they have is a little dirty looking.  The staff seemed very friendly, the only complaint I had is that during the cocktail hour, the snacks were nowhere to be found.  I know I saw food entering a few people's mouths, but no food went anywhere near my mouth which was aggravating at the time...but considering everyone stuffed their faces at dinner it was quickly forgotten.   The dinner was great, some sort of pear and pecan salad to start (was pretty good), I had the stuffed cornish hen for the main and everyone else had steak.  Mine was great. The desert was a creme brulet with a random piece of shortcake cookie on the side, om nom nom x 2000.  This place is good for a small wedding, the dance floor is small and right in front of the bar, and it's nice to be able to go back outside to the private area whenever you want (there's also a gate where you can escape if you want, but I don't know why you'd want to).    I had about 48 glasses of white wine and the bartender was super friendly with each serving.  I'd like to try this place on a regular day sometime, but until then I would recommend it for an intimate wedding reception."}
