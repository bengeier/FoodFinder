{"text":"Awful food brown lettus not fresh  at all.. and the meat balls taste like dog food.. and they have a sign up that's says no refunds they'll fix any order. please don't waste your money....no lines no wait! i see why.. wish someone had warned me"}
{"text":"This place was awesome when it first opened. But since then the quality has deteriorated, prices have gone up and portions have gone down! They nickel and dime you for everything...$1.79 for a breadstick! They use to be $1.00...CRAZY! I got a half portion and it's definitely not half the portion of noodles in there...very disappointed. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I like the concept of a build-your-own salad/pasta place, but the quality here is really lacking.  The marinara sauce was awful, metallic.  They guy recooked my pasta while cooking the vegetables, so it was totally mush.  The salad was brown iceburg lettuce only (I like iceburg, but mix something in to at least make it look green!).  They must have discontinued the spinach and artichoke toppings that some of the other reviews here mentioned.  While the pasta, salad, breadstick, drink combo is more food than I could finish, it was overpriced for $13 (no meat, that would cost even more) considering the quality.  I should have stayed away when I saw this place had the fewest customers in the food court."}
{"text":"What a cool find! I had been trying to think of something new to try today and just by chance ended up at Beechwood Mall. I am so glad I did!  Pastativo located in the food court upstairs, is not your ordinary food court meal. Pastativo is the latest in eateries to try and take a \"chipotle-esqe\" approach to how you order your meal. But in my opinion, they do it much, much better!  You can choose your sauce, choose your type of pasta, choose the size bowl you want... The smaller portion limits you to 5 veggies or additions to your sauce and the regular size gives you unlimited. You may add chicken, meatballs or shrimp for an extra cost.  I chose the regular size with their TIVO sauce. This is a marinara/Alfredo mix of a sauce that is a rich and flavorful combo. I chose penne for the pasta and added chicken for $2 more. For my additions I had mozzarella,  and parmesan cheese. You could also have added bell peppers red peppers, mushrooms, you name it they had it! Fresh tomatoes, broccoli, etc. they cook your dish to order so it did take it about 5 minutes to cook but it was worth the wait. I made mine into a combo with a breadstick and a drink. The breadstick you do not want to pass up. It's a lightly toasted breadstick with garlic butter and Parmesan on top... And mozzarella in the middle.  I loved dipping it in the sauce with my meal.  I had originally planned to only eat half and go back for dessert. They had a lovely looking Tiramisu but I was too full! I will have to have it next time!  I made it a point to go back and thank the staff and I am glad I did! Chef Dee and the gang loved hearing how much I enjoyed dinner and Rachel told me they would soon be starting their own food truck! I hope they will be at Walnut Wednesday's because I know they will be a huge hit! (But they better stick around in Beechwood too -- I would miss them!)   Check them out!"}
{"text":"I love pastativo you get to choose your noodle your meat and your veggies you can even choose your sauce. It's was  in the mall but it was good food. Service was fast."}
{"text":"I'm giving one star because I didn't even have an opportunity to try the food. Silly me for thinking at 12:15pm on an ordinary Wednesday they would actually be open! After ignoring me for a couple minutes I took it upon myself to ask the employee if they were even open. He said they would be in about 10 minutes without any further explanation or apology. Normally the wait wouldn't be a big deal, but I work in an hour and have a 30 minute drive there. I didn't have time to wait today. However, I doubt I'll come back. The disorganization of not being open in the prime lunch hour along with the employee's clear lack of care about opening late puts a rather bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Finally a nice place to customize a salad. They give you a nice portion of greens and you can choice from romaine, iceberg, spinach and/or kale. If you choose the unlimited salad for $7.99 you can have an unlimited number of toppings. We tried the honey mustard dressing this time and it was delicious and dairy free. Found out my talking to the nice people that work there that is is not a chain. Their family started the business so go help support a local business. The Rizzos"}
{"text":"I was at the  mall looking for something to eat with my cousin and I see this pasta place at the food court. Their style is very similar to Piada! I tried a sample of the pasta dish they were giving out and it was good ! I stood in line to get the same pasta I tried. I forgot what my dish was actually called, but when I received it and actually started eating my pasta dish! It's just wasn't good! I'm really not a fan! I wasted my money should of just went to chick fila:("}
{"text":"This place puts Piada to shame. You can customize your salad and pasta to order and they cook it right in front of you! I ordered a pasta bowl with farfalle, tomato cream sauce, lots of vegetables, and a meatball which was absolutely delicious! They offer at least 3 pasta options to choose from (farfalle, penne, spaghetti), 5 sauce options (olive oil with garlic, alfredo, marinara, tomato cream, and pesto), a few meat options which include meatball and chicken, and tons of fresh vegetables and cheeses!  The variety of choices and freshness really puts this place in a category of it's own...and the staff was SO friendly. Pastativo is conveniently located in Beachwood Place Mall's food court so whenever you are at the mall, it's a must! I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The pastas taste fairly ok but I hate the fact that for every little customization, they want to charge.  Example: Can you add a bit more sauce - Yes, it's a $ charge, can I only have 3 out of the 5 toppings but add a bit more of tomatoes - Yes, there is a charge. What the heck, just let me eat my way! Quite annoying!  Greedy business!   Food 4 star Customer service 1 star"}
{"text":"Tried Pastativo for my first time today and LOVED it. I had the pasta with tivo sauce (marinara and alfredo mix) with broccolli, spinach, peppers and tomatoes and it was just so good. You can pick from an areay of toppings to add to your pasta, salad or pizza. The people working were so friendly. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"We ate at Pastativo's this evening for the first time. We'll be back. The food is made fresh and to our individual wishes. Many toppings are offered. All so tasty. Customer service is personal and caring, clarifying to ensure the food delivered is just right."}
{"text":"Place was great before they opened another store in an actual building. It's gone down hill and sucks, cause I loved the food so much. Got rid of half their toppings and the sizes got smaller. Price is still the same, not worth it anymore sadly."}
{"text":"I unfortunately based on today's food have to downgrade to 3 stars.   They chopped spaghetti into 1 inch long. It's not spaghetti anymore. No respectful Italians would serve spaghetti like that, even in food court.   The amount of food they give you per serving also decreased. It's definitely not as filling as when I wrote first review.   It's still a healthier choice at eat at the mall, I'd probably still come to eat here, just not as enthusiastically as before.  Alas all good things come to an end."}
{"text":"Completely disorganized. Waited ten minutes for them to start cooking the order. They messed up the order before me and the staff used profanity each time they messed up. Disorganized, poor quality food, and spoke with the owner who was worthless. They earned a one star and should learn how to service customers. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Very similar to many fast causal places -- you choose your meat and veggies and they make it.   2 things (which is why they got 2 stars off) -- first and foremost, the service was AWFUL. Literally did not care about what we wanted, just cared about getting us through the line. I had to ask for a receipt -- he walked away from the cash register without telling me I am good. I don't know what took so long to get me though the wait of me paying for my food (the wait to make my food was not a problem, but from the time it was done to the time I fully paid for it was about 5-7 minutes).   Secondly, the food was eh. The meatballs were not very good at all (it was very cold) and the pasta sauce (the red sauce) wasn't amazing (I'm used to a homemade Italian sauce).   For my first time coming here, it was not a good experience. Will probably be my last."}
{"text":"A good food choice for a mall. You can choose to go real healthy or to load up the cheese!!!! Pastativo is like a piada, but with less choices and shorter lines. The one special thing......... BOSCO STICKS!!! If anyone is as lucky as I am, you know what a bosco stick is and why it's worth the trip. For those unlucky few, this is a WARM garlic bread stick with moz cheese in the middle. And I'm going to leave it at that. (Can you tell I love cheese?!?!)"}
{"text":"3 stars in the realm of \"fast food\": it's good. So I've tried the pasta twice with different variations and it had the same result... Descent. So the thing is, the sauces taste a lot like what you get from jars and the bowl is more pasta than toppings. I was also unhappy about the price. It clearly says on the board a regular size with unlimited toppings is 7.99 & a few lines below it shows that meat is $2 for chicken and $3 for shrimp. So I didn't know that when I was making my order, I just thought all things are included as toppings! Oh well, my fault. But 12$ is a lot for so-so pasta with not that many toppings. It all tastes good but isn't impressive... Especially when there is Piada in the world."}
{"text":"Yum! You get your choice of pasta shapes, choice of sauce, unlimited toppings and for-a-charge, meat. We both got the bowtie pasta with the Tivo (blush) sauce . I got the black olive and egg toppings plus a cheese choice, mine being parmesan. Super delicious, relatively inexpensive and super-friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This a a great place considering that it is in a mall food court. Great selection of toppings and everything is customizable. They cook everything right in front of you too! My boyfriend and found a deal on groupon so it was very affordable."}
{"text":"For a fast food stall in a mall, this place has good food. I love pasta, and this place made me excited to be able to build my own. They cook everything fresh in front of you, and you have your main options of picking a type of pasta, sauce, meat, and veggies/mix-ins. They charge for every mix-in, and it's a bit expensive. The portion sizes are average, but it's heavy. It took about ten minutes for my friend and I to have our meals. My issue here was the staff. They had two people working a Tuesday night shift and only one of them was preparing the food. She listened to music with her earbuds in while attending to guests. She did not guide me through the menu even though I said it was my first time there, and did not ask if I wanted anything else, even a drink. I would have bought a second meal to take home, but since she was the only one cooking, it was very slow. I wondered why everyone went to the other places in the food court."}
