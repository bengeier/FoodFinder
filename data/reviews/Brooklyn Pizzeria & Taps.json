{"text":"Not a bad place at all to grab a beer and some appies. Food has always been good and service very friendly which is sadly hard to find these days! Any problems I've had have been dealt with very promptly with great kindness. I hate to complain so when I do I appreciate my concerns being addressed the way these guys do. Good wings!!"}
{"text":"This place just recently opened and I was amazed with the service, food, and ambiance. Our server was very outgoing, attentive, and easy to talk to. The food was DELICIOUS, and the restaurant had a casual and relaxing vibe to it. We went on a weekday for dinner so weekends are probably more of a party scene as the server mentioned something about live bands. Awesome place! Will most likely go back there again."}
{"text":"First time visitor today. Considering it was a cool saturday afternoon there wasn't a lot of customers there. We were immediately met at the door and asked if we wanted dining room or pub side. 
Took us a while to read over the menu, but the waitress gave us all the time we needed and brought our drinks in the meantime. My wife ordered the Butter Chicken Club and I ordered the Bronx Burger. After we ordered we noticed an appetizer called Tower of Onion Rings, we'll we had to add that to our order. Onion rings were nice and thick and came with a Sriracha Mayo for dipping. Excellent serving and taste. 
Then our lunches came out, wife's sandwich was made with two colors of spiral bread. However the Butter part of the Butter Chicken Club never quite made it to the plate. It was still an excellent chicken sandwich but was nowhere near being Butter Chicken. We did mention it to the waitress after we were done and she went to ask the kitchen. When she came back she told us there was a misinterpretation in the kitchen as to what constitutes Butter Chicken. She did offer us a free dessert to which we graciously declined but did say we would be back.
The way to tell if you have a good burger is if you need more than one napkin it passes the test. The Bronx Burger is a three napkin adventure. 
The only negative today was it is a little pricey but very good food. Would like to go back when it's busier to see what the service is like then. 
Overall very happy with our discovery today."}
{"text":"We eat at Brooklyn regularly and order the same thing every time - hot wings and pizza. The hot wings are spicy and delicious and the pizza is the best we've had in Calgary. The Brooklyn Brawler is the one we order most often and we haven't been disappointed yet. Service is always great too!"}
{"text":"Was my first time here, had a great time, great service, had the onion rings as an appetizer and they were the best I've had. Had their spaghetti special which was also great. Topped off the meal with a cheesecake desert wrapped in a pastry, was so tasty!!  My man and I had to roll ourselves out the door. Looking forward to another date night here."}
{"text":"I hate to do this, but if the food is terrible, the restaurants needs to know. Maybe they can change for the better.

First off I have gave them two stars only because they have had good reviews on the pizza and my wife and I did not have the pizza. Also the waiter was extremely friendly and deserved a star.

We had a couple of the other items on the menu. I had the spaghetti and meatballs and my wife had the Chicken Parmigiana Sandwich. 

Starting with the chicken sandwich. The menu states for the chicken parmigiana sandwich : \"Fresh chicken breast lightly breaded in-house\" Unfortunately there is no way in the world that breaded chicken breast was fresh, more likely reheated in a microwave, probably one or two days old, straight out of the fridge. Absolutely terrible taste.

The spaghetti and meatballs: the best thing I could say about this dish is the spaghetti was cooked right. The meatballs (and I use the word meat very loosely) tasted like there was only bread crumbs and no meat in there, with absolutely no flavour. \"WHERE'S the BEEF\"!  This dish comes with a plate full of spaghetti, tomato sauce and three small (1\" dia.) meatballs. Wow! Suggestion: change your meatball recipe and either increase the size of your meatballs or put at least five on one serving. Don't be so cheap.

As well the tomato sauce could not have been homemade, it must be from a can - awful. Even the worst cook in the world could make a better tomato sauce. Apparently, and I am only guessing, they use this sauce on everything. If that's so I cannot image their pizza is any good, not with this sauce. Maybe the cooking process kills taste out of the pizza.

Harsh, but true.

Changes are needed, if you can't serve good food other than your pizzas than stick to the pizza and leave Italian food to the experts."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Calgary hands down!! Great atmosphere and great patio,The staff are friendly and attentive my beer was never empty. Love the place."}
{"text":"Really great pizza with some different flavours but make sure you have room for the cheesecake for dessert!"}
{"text":"Great pizza place in NW Calgary!  When they first opened much was to be desired but they have improved a lot and their food and service is exceptional now.  The waitress recommended the Pork and Fig pizza which was absolutely amazing.  All round solid choice to take the family for tasty Italian style pizza."}
{"text":"Ok so we went back to this place cause we had a pretty good experience the first time...this time probably the worst of any restaurant we've been to. Pretty simple meal I thought we ordered. Kids pasta and a medium pizza you would think wouldn't take more than 20 mins especially when we were maybe the fourth table in this big place. Took 45 mins for the pasta to come (noodles and pasta sauce) and 1 hor 15 mins for the pizza. Watters said the cooks got the order wrong at around the 40 min mark but still come on! Had the manager come by and apologize and literally said she would take care of the pizza which in my mind is fair but really they shouldve taken care of the entire bill. They took 50% off the pizza price??? Again...come on. Told her that we wouldn't be coming back but didn't seem to matter at that point. Brutal Brooklyn pizza. You had the opportunity to turn something bad into good...hope you read this and reach out to me cause i'ma leave this same review everywhere."}
{"text":"Got takeout from this place tonight..
I would have been better off with Mc Donald's!! 
I got the risotto balls.. They where mushy and cold!!! Also got the pasta with the mushrooms and bacon and it tasted like over cooked cold pasta with some melted butter on it.. Also asked for chicken on it twice and I could tell the girl o the phone was not listening and like I figured no chicken 
I was hoping this place would be good but I will never return after the garbage i was served"}
{"text":"Went with my family for a quick and easy sit down dinner. Food was good, 80's pop music was a bit disturbing. Very quick, wife loves hockey so the big screen TV's were great for her. There wasn't too much of a menu and it was so dark it was hard to read the photocopied menu. It's new too us and I'm hoping that it will get better in the coming months."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great for dinner, drinks or a quick lunch. Fantastic service, pizza was great and lots of parking. I have been here when it was The Rock and I find it so much better food wise now. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Tried out Brooklyn pizzaria this evening for the first time. We were happy to finally find a place in Calgary where you have great food and great service at the same time. We ordered the Brooklyn brawler I believe. Which was delicious, for dessert we had a apple pie and tiramisu* both met our expectations. The manager Hemi made sure our experience was enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family. And will return in the near future."}
{"text":"BEWARE GLUTEN FREE PEOPLE!!!!!Went there last night because I saw they had excellent gluten free options.

Told server I needed gluten and dairy free as soon as we arrived. Was offered excellent choices and opinions on what to get.

Received my food and ate a whole slice of pizza before asking server if it was gluten free. I was informed it was NOT. Please be warned and make sure you are safe to be eating what you ordered!!!

When the bill came around I was offered NO discount and had to ask. Was only offered 50% off the pizza and no more.

The food was good BUT suffered all night because of the mistake. Not very impressed with having to ask for a discount and then only receiving 50% off. I will now struggle for 1-3 days because of this mistake !!!!!!

Never going back..!!!! Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Ordered calamari, mixed green house salad, and the meat pizza. All were tasty. I was especially impressed with the calamari. The pizza was generous with a variety of meat, with the only drawback being that the centre got a bit soggy. Ate on the patio which was very spacious and chairs were comfortable. It also got a lot of sun! Aneel was our server and he provided very friendly and overall great service!"}
{"text":"After reading the review in the Calgary Herald my wife and I tried the pizza. Horrible! Bad service, waitress brought wrong pizza, which we tasted 1 terrible bite then had long wait for correct pizza, Brooklyn Bridge. Sauce was merely chopped canned tomatoes with some herbs, cheese was terrible, taste strange. Seems like they try to be different but novelty does not equal quality. Horrible"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to meet someone for lunch. Lots of parking and the restaurant itself is spacious. The music was playing at a decent level so you could have table conversation unlike some places. I had been here when it was the Rock Pizzeria. It still looks the same, has the same staff and feel but the menu seems to have changed. (Same owner)
Pizza is the go-to here so I got the Jamaican with NY style crust. I loved the fresh mango atop of it but man, they overloaded too much on the bell peppers. It was not spicy at all even though it had promised to be, sad for me.
My friend opted for the thin crust which I stayed away from as some reviewers mentioned it was as thin and as crispy as a cracker. Her and I swapped a piece and it was actually not that bad. My friend wanted to make a couple of substitutions too on her order and staff were fine with that, very accommodating.
I asked for a side pizza sauce with my pie as I found it a bit dry and to my amazement, I was not charged for it! :) It was  good, house-made marinara I believe it was.
I had ordered a med pizza and wow, a big medium it was and I took half home for later. $18, way cheaper than some other Calgary places for za.
I also spoke to friends that had been there on other occasions and they recommend the burger and the fish tacos if you are into that.
I would return here for pizza, maybe for take out to try out some of the other creations they offer.
Oh, and my dining partner also got the beer battered fries as an appy to try. They never came until after we got our meal and reminded staff of them who had forgotten to ring them in for us... (free, thank you). They were hot, crunchy and delicious - a must try!
Barring that mishap, the service has improved since its days as the Rock, I prefer it better now to what it once was."}
{"text":"Nice location, clean place with good ambiance, friendly servers and great beer!

We liked the few specialty pizzas we tried for lunch, the Brooklyn bridge and old brooklyn's fire headquarters are our favorites. The have pretty unique and savory flavors, much better than a regular joint.

Highly recommended for pizza lovers!"}
{"text":"Went to Brooklyn Pizzeria with the girlfriend and another couple on a Friday night. Cool environment and decor, all New York-like. A surprising amount of families and kids. Didn't have to wait to get in, which was nice. 
Drinks first: I had a Granville Island Winter Ale (points for that!), girlfriend had a mojito, which was \"alright\". We each ordered a 9\" Brooklyn-style pizza, which is like a thin crust; I had a traditional one with prosciutto and arugula, she had one with pork, pineapple, and bbq sauce. Our couple friends ordered a Chicago deep dish style pizza with a selection of ingredients to share; upon learning that it would take about 45 minutes to make, we also ordered bruschetta and onion rings as appetizers. Bruschetta was pretty small, only four pieces of bread, onion rings were big and tasty. My girlfriend and I both enjoyed our pizzas, but the other couple was not impressed with their deep dish, it seemed that even though they picked all these different toppings, they only got a few of each on a pretty big pie. They didn't even keep it for leftovers.
After ordering and even after we got our food, we hardly saw our server, which was aggravating after our drinks had run dry, especially considering after we arrived around 6:30 and ordered, the place seemed to empty out. 
All in all, it wasn't bad, but it would be tough to convince me to drive all the way out to the area when there's Double Zero Pizza downtown and Chinook and Una on 17th."}
{"text":"The decor was well thought out. The restaurant has a very urban, New York vibe and good music. We went on a Friday night and it was pretty empty, however the service was fast, which was great. 

The bruschetta was very tasty. The truffle onion rings weren't really truffle, and just tasted like onion rings with some cheese on top. The pizza tasted good but wasn't Brooklyn style pizza as the crust wasn't that thin. I had the vegetarian pizza, which I'd recommend if you like the taste of a homemade, thicker dough, and smokier cheddar taste. Portions are very generous so you'll be taking leftovers home (never a bad thing)!

Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"A great place to take the family out, it used to be our go to, especially with 3 celiacs in the family! But lately we have gone elsewhere. Food has been only \"ok\".
Their gluten free pizza needs some work, not my first choice in the city. And their salads leave a lot to be desired, although others in my family rave about them, I prefer smash burgers salad down the street!
Wings are very good, and they do have a lot of options for us celiacs. Just wish they would up their gf game a bit! So maybe if you don't have to go gluten free you would be good.
Service has always been exceptional. Atmosphere is great as well, so there's that."}
{"text":"I'm so sad to hear that this place is closing their doors, I literally JUST discovered them yesterday!
I went for my birthday with a party of 20.
The service was mostly good, there were a few mishaps, but with a group that large I'd expect that.
The food was delicious! And we were looking forward to having a new date spot!
We'll have to check out the Cochrane location. Thank you for making my birthday awesome!"}
{"text":"Seems like this place still needs Managment. Menu is half what the old place was.  Patio was still closed at 16:30 on a sunny day and the food is moderate at best. 

My service was fantastic but the place feels like it could be closed any day.  

Please fix this place up.  I'm local and we need more choices.  Stop trying to compete with the bars 500 feet away and be a good restaurant."}
{"text":"I eventually had the pizza I knew could come from Brooklyn unfortunately it was try 3. 

1.  terrible crust good toppings
2. good crust and stingy toppings
3. perfection that could have come from nyc itself.

Unfortunately for Brooklyn even the perfect pizza came with an appy flop when they couldn't get the pretzel's mustrard sauce right.  Normally it's a creamy mustard flavor that's kind of sweet.  It came out mostly like plain mustard.  We mentioned something and we got back an unmixed goo that had like honey and mustard,  By the end of the meal the kitchen realized they forgot an ingredient.  Yeah.... I know?!

That kind of brings me to my point.  Brooklyn has terrible CONSISTENCY but they had promise if they can pull it together.   Even their menu is polarized by hits and misses. 

Hits:
Pretzels
New York Pizza
Pork Cutlet
Cheesecake

Misses:
baked ziti  (was penne with tomatoe sause and a little cheese - this is not baked and the wrong pasta.  The sauce is boring and the pasta was just over cooked because I'm sure they baked in an over just without any cheese but I assume it wasn't al dente before baking.. so it was basically mush)    I couldn't eat much and didn't take the left overs
anything other than the ny crust on the pizza.  Gag. 
The veggie wrap - boring,  needlessly messy and way to much sauce. 

I urge the management to pair the menu down and train their staff better to get good quality out to the tables EVERY time."}
{"text":"If you want to treat your pallet to a little bit of European quality, this is the spot. 

Before I even bit into my Bugsy Segal pizza the flavor was coming through the smell of the smoked meat into my taste buds. I HAD to ask - and yes, it was slow roasted in house for 5 hours. 

Pretty much you're getting meat as good or better than the best BBQ places in town on your dishes. 

The Citrus Chicken salad had the most incredible fresh citrus flavor in the dressing - you'd swear you took a bite right out of Florida. The chicken - flame broiled over hardwood with a flavor that I haven't had in any dish in Calgary before. 

Turns out the chef is direct from Europe, and this establishment imports many of its key ingredients from there. 

HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"Went last night with the family and it was fantastic. I got the bacon and mushroom pasta. I'm already craving it again. It was spectacular. The boys had pizzas and they were incredible too. We loved it and will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant with the best pizza and staff. I highly recommend it. They also have super fun paint nite!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Food is wonderful! Pasta portions were large and overall delicious!"}
{"text":"My friend and I got off to a rocky start with our waitress. We decided to order chicken wings as a starter, we ordered honey garlic and ended up with BBQ. When we mentioned it to our waitress she went to the kitchen and learned that the restaurant doesn't actually have honey garlic flavouring for chicken wings. So we ended up with the BBQ wings, the wings were a bit dry but the BBQ flavour was pretty good.

For my main course, I ordered the Brooklyn bridge pizza. I ordered it without the pine nuts and added bacon. This pizza was fantastic. It wasn't greasy at all. I would definitely recommend this pizza to anyone, I would definitely order it again. 

The restaurant itself is clean, uncluttered and the artwork is very nice. I could do without their choice of music though, not a big fan of current pop music. Overall, a good restaurant."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and from the start it was great. Our server Leonie was super friendly. The
Brucshetta was amazing!...and the pizza was legit. If you're looking for a new spot for a nice slice...check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"This was my third time to Brooklyn, and like the first two times, the food was very good ... the fries are delish.

However, like the previous two times the service was, well, weird.  It wasn't \"Bad\" just not normal. We are often interrupted during serious or in-depth conversations - just to check things out ... the servers need to learn to read its customers.  

It also appears the servers need some training, my friend had asked for change for a $20, and she returned with $15 and was questioned, she said my friend had talked to fast, and snipped back, fine I'll get you another $5.  this was after, redoing the bills, when we asked to pay with two credit cards (and same bill), the server did not know how to divide the total in half and enter the amount into the credit card machine.  In the end the \"manager\" intervened, things became heated and escalated in anger and tempers flared.  I am still shaking my head over the whole situation"}
{"text":"Oh man.  We ordered a pizza, the wonder wheel and I told my husband it was the best pizza I ever ate!  Super friendly wait staff, we had Karen and she was so sweet and friendly. Pizza crust was unbelievable.  Sooo good."}
{"text":"The deep dish has finally arrived, and having spent considerable time in Chicago, this isn't too bad, considering it's 1000 miles away. 

Currently they are only offering 4 topping options, so I went with the Dom Deluise. Pretty tasty. 

Either way, very good deep dish. Can't wait to have the option to build my own though."}
{"text":"Brendan at Brooklyn pizza made our night. Besides the fact that the pizza was delicious, our drinks were perfect. 10/10 would come again for Brendan 
#Brendan2020"}
{"text":"Authentic, hard to find Italian pizza. Excellent service and delicious food. Chef came and greeted us at our table. Cheers!"}
{"text":"So happy we discovered this hidden gem in Royal Oak! 

The pizza great- I recommend the prospect park. I would say the type and quality is comparable to Una on 17th. 

Really surprised at how good their house beer is too. Tried the flight and loved it (good price too!). 

Hope this place sticks around; there aren't any other really great pizza places in this area! 

100% would recommend."}
{"text":"Started with a very friendly and warm welcome by the hostess. Followed by a greeting by an awesome server with a friendly personality and super knowledgable!  We started with the baked pretzel with cheese sauce and chips - Wow!!! Had a couple draft beers and some seriously good pizza, try the Prospect Park, you'll LOVE it! Finished with the Phyllo wrapped cheesecake. An amazing experience on a Friday night out with my wife!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza place! Ordered some salt and pepper wings and the bacon pizza! Our waiters also gave us great service, I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Flat beer is not a good start to the evening. However the food was half decent. Pizza was on point but the service ....so so very slow. I don't have confidence that that the server had any idea what was on the menu. The staff was friendly enough but I had just hoped for more. The atmosphere is as good with a cool industrial vibe."}
{"text":"Simply....the Pizza isn't what a pizza should be. You can have all the different combinations you want but you must have the basics. I have eaten pizza in a lot of different places. I never had less traditional pizza choices on the menu. It was Saturday night and not many there. I guess others figured it out."}
