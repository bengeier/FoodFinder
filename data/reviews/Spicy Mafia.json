{"text":"Spicy Mafia is good if you want to have hot pot but you're not a big eater or have an average appetite.  It's not AYCE but you have the choice to add on extra food for $1.50 or $2.50 per serving.  There are also snacks you can order, if you're still hungry."}
{"text":"It's a nice restaurant to go in the cold weekday night. The restaurant is not tooooo busy and the service is good,  food is descent. We have a great time there."}
{"text":"After reading some reviews from Yelp and Instagram, I ultimately came to this new hot pot restaurant for a Saturday lunch today. Essentially, I don't like sharing hot pot, but I'm really interested in this mini hot pot idea cooking your own stuff at your own pace, no sharing. That's mainly the reason why it brought me here today. $12.99 plus tax per person.   I ordered one sweet potato pork bone soup base and my friend ordered one signature spicy soup base. Then, we both picked the fresh rice noodle and New Zealand spring lamb with two free dipping sauces for each individual person. We picked housemade sesame sauce, herbal sauce, housemade fermented bean curd sauce and coriander. We spent almost one hour and an half with the cooking and eating food.   At the end, we both really had a great time at this place enjoying our food with lots of fun. Will definitely come back and recommend this to others..."}
{"text":"IF I can, I really want to give zero star. The food completely do not have any flavor except spicy and oil. Terrible experience. I waste my money and I have to search another restaurant."}
{"text":"A very large fresh serving of food  and very good service and reasonably priced. The restaurant was very clean and underground parking that was free. What's not to love. Looking forward to my nest visit. highly recommend Spicy Mafia."}
{"text":"This place is ok. I honestly feel like I could have made a cup of ramen at home and it would have been about the same. The milk tea was good, and if I ever do come back, it'll probably just be for that."}
{"text":"This place was good but portions are so small. I like the individual pots and the variety in flavors but I would rather go ayce hot pot for a bit more."}
{"text":"Spicy Mafia replaced HOPO and is located beside the Chatime on Warden north of Steeles.  It looks like it kept the tables and chairs from the previous restaurant and painted large murals on the wall of wannabe gangsters.  Similarly to the previous restaurant, seating space is lacking with many patrons crammed into small tables with not much space between them.  Although the veggies are of a decent variety, the meat and sauce portions were not generous in amount.  If you're expecting to be stuffed, best to go somewhere else since it's not AYCE.    The spicy soup base (the one with the two chilies) was way spicier than I expected.  I guess I should have prepared myself going here with that name in its title.    Service here is a bit lacking.  When I went on a busy weekday evening, there was only one competent server (dude with the glasses) while everyone else looked like they didn't want to be there.  We had to ask to have menus and eating utensils provided, as well as drinking water.    Overall, the food was decent.  It was good value for price paid, considering it's a-la-carte."}
{"text":"Didn't realize this place closed already, but I'll still comment about my experience.   Tried this place when they were doing their buy 1 get 1 free offer during their soft opening. This is not an AYCE place. Basically, you get to choose the soup base, sauce, and noodles and for the toppings, they have been predetermined (a bit of enoki, veggie, crab meat, luncheon meat etc.). I would have preferred if I could choose say, 8 toppings? There were a few things in the toppings bowl that I don't like.   I like this idea more than AYCE because I think for AYCE, you're basically forcing yourself to eat more because you paid such an expensive price already. Regular price is around $13-15 per person, would have probably visit this place in the winter if it hadn't closed down."}
{"text":"Came with a friend during their buy one get one special. They were packed at the time, but once we were settled service was on point. Water and extra soup for our personal hotpots was quick. The flavours of the soup were certainly tasty but the amount of food at its full price is definitely not worth the value. However, the deal cut that cost in half, which made the experience decent. The music was on point! Would definitely come back if they drop their price just a couple of dollars for the same amount of food we got per person."}
{"text":"This location is very close to my work.  I've driven past it many times in the mornings on my way to Starbucks. I've always waned to but never got the chance to till today! It was perfect for a cold winter day!   Spicy mafia is located at 20 Gibson. The same plaza as Chatime and Sweet Esc. THe parking there is quite limited and very busy all the time because of the food, pharmacy, doctors office, and businesses. That's the only downfall.   I got a table for two today and we were testing out the new item on their menu. It was a 5 Minute DIY noodle bar. Basically you walk up to a open fridge and choose the meats and veggies you want to add to your noodle bowl. It is $8.99 per pound of food. I chose a bunch of beef balls, fish balls, red sausage, mini sausage, enokki mushroom, bamboo shoots, tofu, frozen tofu, udon, and imitation crab meat. Once you finish making your selection, you bring it to the counter where they weigh your food. At this counter you choose your broth too. They had about 5 different broths, but we chose the signature spicy broth and the spicy ectacy broth. We also went with the medium heat. Caution and word of advice here! Medium heat is already VERY spicy. I normally can take heat, but i had to take breaks between this spicy meal to let my mouth cool down.   Once you've chosen your broth you can choose to add some premium toppings like certified angus beef, mussels, whole shrimps, and lamb for $2.50.   They also have delicious drinks to choose from for the price of $4.99. We tried the kiwi juice and the Thai slush coconut milk. The drinks are a bit pricy, but definitely worth it! The coconut Thai drink was exceptional! A must try! Overall, i loved this restaurant and would defiantly be coming back soon to try the individual hot pots!"}
{"text":"BOGO mini hot pot for $12.99 was definitely a great promotion, but I probably wouldn't come back.   The portions were too small with that pricing you could definitely go out and buy more at a supermarket and cook it at home."}
{"text":"Basically mainland Asia version of Deer Garden - more selection but more expensive. Very casual, fast Asian foods. Bright with several seatings, good for students that want to drop by for a quick lunch. Fast service: only took about 10 mins from picking ingredients to getting your food!   You get to pick your own ingredients where they make it into a hotpot stew for you. You just grab what you want into the bowl and bring it up to the counter, remember to put noodles into your bowl too! When you bring it up, they basically just add the soup and boil it for you.   $8.99/lb choose your own soup (signature spicy soup). Very yummy, 4 levels of spicy - got regular and it was pretty weak. Overall, it was surprisingly really good (RECOMMEND)  $4.50 whole lemon black (NOT RECOMMENDED) /green tea - pretty good but wouldn't recommend paying for this (cost: lemon $0.5 + tea $0.25, that's a 600% markup but I guess that's all foods )  4 stars for the food, relatively pricey for what you're getting so 3 stars.  ***Debit/Cash Only***"}
{"text":"Left this place with a bad taste in my mouth ... again. We decided to come here for hot pot since we weren't feeling all you can eat. I've been here before where I waited 45 minutes for my food but you can read the full story on Jasmine K's review.  Food 3/5 You can choose either customized noodle bowl or mini hot pot. Hot pot came with a choice of soup, meat, noodle and a bowl of assorted items. We got extra meat ($2.50 for 8 pieces) and fish balls ($1.50 for 3). The meal on its own was a good portion that leaves you feeling content. Pork soup was a little salty and the numbing spice was decently spicy. Food was average, nothing special.  Service 2/5 Came here on a Friday night and waited 10 minutes for a table. Servers mainly speak Mandarin so you can tell a difference in service if you don't speak it. One server brought our food but never once spoke a word to us nor told us what he brought. Water wasn't served until we asked and had to ask for refills. However another server was courteous enough to ask how our meal was while adding soup to our pots.  Long story short, food is decent but service is close to non-existent. Came for the 20% discount with social media post but was told it was over despite the ad on every table."}
{"text":"Spicy Mafia is visible from the street but you may miss it if you don't know it's tucked behind Chatime.  There are only a handful of tables (about 20?) which can get busy depending on what time you come.    The hotpot is a small individual pot with your own small gas stove.  All your food comes in the little pot in a variety of soups. This being said, the portions are not that big though it does come with your choice of rice/noodles.  Unfortunately the gas stove is only ever too strong or too weak and I can't adjust it to be a mild temperature while heating my food.    That they have one person small portion hotpot is the only redeeming factor at Spicy Mafia - sometimes I crave hotpot but don't want to go all out at an AYCE.  Other than this, their service is horrid and their staff cannot speak any English.  You will not even get a glass of water even after asking a few times.  The staff will explain the menu/promotions/new items incorrectly and not be able to do anything about it.  For example, their new promotion is a weigh-your-own-food counter where you will later pick your own soup base etc.  From the server's limited English I understood this to be a hotpot option, but it isn't.  They simply take the food you've picked, cook it and put it in a bowl for you.  I later brought it up with the server who, again, cannot understand enough to even know he's misled us.  I'll end up coming again because I love hotpot and there's a serious lack of options for non AYCE hotpot, but I would not highly recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"It's good. It is a fun set up. It's like a DIY noodles restaurant where you can add extra sides for extra cost.  Would come again"}
{"text":"Recommended place to get your hot pot cravings satisfied if you're under a budget! Considering a lot of hot pot places are quite expensive and usually AYCE, if you want to feel content then this is the place to go. Unless you have a big appetite. $13-14 as a base price for individual hot pot is considered pretty reasonable.   The concept of the individual hot pots are cute, and comes with a bowl of a few different selections of veggies, meats, seafood, and other things - although I do wish it came with soft tofu. :( But you can always add other toppings, at a cost. I also don't quite understand the need to add +$1.50 for udon noodles.   We got the spicy and the pork bone soup, and the broths were actually quite flavourful! I thoroughly enjoyed my pork bone soup base with the sesame and chili oil as my sauces. The spicy soup was definitely spicy, but not the kind of spicy I enjoy, as it contains the numbing spice.   The service could have been better. Considering we went to go eat around 4-5pm the place was practically empty, yet we had to ask several times to bring water, refill our pots, and ask for napkins! Although the waiters would walk by quite frequently, it's important to be wary of anything your customers might need more of."}
{"text":"I've been to Spicy Mafia twice now and had a good experience both times. The first visit was with a group of 6, we called in advance to reserve a table, and when we got there the table was already set up and ready with menues which was a nice touch.    Food: love the pork bone broth, full of flavour without tasting salty.  The combo comes with an assorted bowl of ingredients (cabage, lettuce, enoki, lotus, spam, red sausage, 1 shrimp, corn, tofu), a little bit of each only but good variety, 1 noodle selection, 1 meat selection, 2 sauce selection.  I also added watercress for $1.50 which came in a decent portion size.  Service: they constantly come to refill the soupbase and service was good overall.  It was a bit slow getting the initial pot, considering it is just soup in a bowl I think this is the one area they can improve on.  Place: newly renovated, enjoyed the individual pot rather than sharing a communal pot.  Easy to run out of table space though if ordering additional items.  Price: buy 1 get 1 free is an Amazing deal.  $12.99 for 2 hotpot combos, deal ends Dec. 10 so make sure you go soon to take advantage and try it out.    Overall, I like this place and considering its a 'soft opening' I think they've done a great job so far.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Came here during the weekday, and noticed that there weren't a lot of people eating there. That was already a red flag, and I should've walked away. As you walk in, you'll notice the cool artwork they have on the walls. As you get seated, the waiter will ask if it will be your first time at the restaurant, and they'll try to help you order and also give you their recommendations. I ordered the Lamb Package, that comes along with the Pork Bone Soup base.   As my order arrived, I noticed a lot of the items that were included, you can actually get from a Chinese supermarket in the frozen section. Anyone that has had hotpot before, will know what I am talking about. The portion is super small...and I actually contemplated if I should order McDonalds after this. FYI: I do eat a lot   What was good?  - pork bone soup base was actually pretty tasty - service was good  What was bad?  - again, portion was small...won't be enough for a man's belly - was expecting everything to be freshly made, but felt like it was just frozen food - prices....not worth it for what you get. I had ordered an additional side dish of stuffed fish balls. I got 3, for $3-$4....... - very little options on the menu  Recommendation: No. That is all I have to say."}
{"text":"{Signature Spicy Soup Base with Rice Noodles, New Zealand Spring Lamb and Housemade Spicy Oil ~ Housemade Porkbone Soup Base with Japanese Udon, New Zealand Spring Lamb and Housemade Spicy Oil}  @spi  Hot pot season is here! But let's be honest, it's always hot pot season   Spicy Mafia is the new Malatang style hot pot restaurant by the same team as Morals Village! We love hot pot and we love spicy...So obviously we had to try out this place! We went on the last day of BOGO (buy one get one pot free) at noonish. It's a relatively small place so you probably will have to wait a little bit. The restaurant was full, so we had to give our name and number and waited at the Chatime beside the restaurant. We only had to wait 15-20 minutes before they called us. It's a hip/urbanish restaurant with drawings of \"gangster\" cartoons on the walls. It really reminded me of Young & Dangerous LOL  They also played hip hop styled Christmas music...which I loved since I could jam and eat at the same time. LOL  FHubs ordered the signature spicy hot pot while I ordered the pork bone one to try. It came out very fast! I loved that you get your own cute little shabu shabu pot!!  The pot already comes with dipping sauce (of your choice) and a bowl of assorted foods for you to cook (like shrimp, corn, lettuce, etc). I suggest trying their housemade spicy oil!! It sorta looked like soy sauce but the flavour is phenomenal! I can't even describe it...so try it! We ordered the squid balls and fish tofu because how can you not order that at hot pot right? It was $1.50 per order and it can get pretty expensive. One order only had like 2-3 balls.  But the soup base was really good!! We were so impressed with the flavour. His soup base wasn't too spicy, and mine had an amazing umami flavour to it!!  After cooking everything in the soup, the soup became a delicious broth for our noodles! Loved it.  This portion was actually perfect for me. I don't eat a lot for hot pot anyways so it was perfect! It can get expensive if you are really hungry and just want to order like 10000 fish balls for your pot LOL  So I don't recommend this place if you're starving. This place is like an upscale hot pot place, perfect enough to bring someone here on a date (I would love to come here on a date seriously LOL)  Share your Spicy Mafia meal on social media to receive 20% off!!"}
{"text":"Brought to you by the same owners of Morals Village, I can describe this place as getting to try Morals Village ala carte (at least if you go for the Hot Pot). It's a great place to go if you don't want to eat ayce, or don't want to be paying too much for hot pot.  Mini Hot Pot Combo: For $12.99-$14.99 (depending on soupbase and noodle), you get a mini hot pot, a noodle of your choice, a meat of your choice and 11 different Malatang toppings. It's actually very filling, and the soupbase is refillable (a plus for people like me who actually drink the soup). Meat people may not be too happy though as you won't get a lot of meat in this case, but you can definitely order add-ons of meat, which may still end up cheaper.  The soupbase is pretty much a subset of Morals Village's soupbase with the addition of Chinese Angelic Soupbase, which is the healthier herbal soup.  Snacks: The chicken nuggets ($5.99) is pretty much a delicious chicken tonkatsu - not sure why it's called nuggets. And the cold noodles ($5.99) mixed with spicy sauce is very good and a generous portion that's good to share!  Service: Since they are new (opened around 2 weeks), service really needs to improve. It is very slow and orders are missing or needs follow-up."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband on a cold night because I had a craving for hot pot. We liked the previous Hopo so we thought we'd give Spicy Mafia a try. We were greeted by staffs who spoke to us in Mandarin as soon as we entered. When I spoke to our server in English, it seemed as though her English was very poor and we had a hard time communicating. Despite that, She still managed to explain to us that we could either order the set menu written on the placemats or customize our own menu at the front with a 20% discount. I thought that was a pretty good deal considering that I got to pick what and how much I liked to eat. So I walked up to the front and started picking my toppings. However, none of them were labelled and it seemed like the staffs weren't even familiar with what they were either (like the type of meatballs). Any who, I picked all the toppings I wanted and found out that the soup base I originally wanted from the set menu wasn't an option in the customized menu. It wasn't clear to me at all. After the staff entered in the weight and the cost, he took my toppings and disappeared to the kitchen, leaving me quite lost in the front counter. When he came back out a few minutes later, his mouth was stuffed with food. He then told me, my food would be ready at my table (while chewing on his food).  My husband stuck with the set menu mini hot pot which was $12.99 and got their signature special spicy soup base in mild. His set came with 8 thin slices of beef, his choice of noodles, few slices of cabbage, imitation crab, luncheon meat, enoki mushrooms, 1 pc of shrimp etc. for a total of 11 toppings. The set although presented neatly, was absolutely not enough for a grown man like him. The broth was extremely spicy even though we ordered mild. If you accidentally bite into one of the hot peppers (which wasn't hard to do since the broth was full of them), your tongue will go numb.   Then came the moment of truth! My set arrived and it looked like the saddest thing on earth. I was in the crossroad of bewilderment and shock. They gave me a bowl of mishmash in soup!!! My hot pot that I had been craving for became a bowl of random noodles that I could make at home! That was when they told me what I ordered wasn't hot pot! They'd cook everything for you if you selected the toppings at the front! Even though the staff apologized for the misunderstanding, I almost felt like I got scammed since the whole restaurant was plastered with the word, \"Hot Pot\" everywhere. I had never been so confused at a restaurant before. And for the quality and quantity of what we got? Sorry, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The food is 3 star, but the cashier did not acknowledge/stop customers that apparently cut lines to get in front of me, so 2 stars."}
{"text":"As said before, this place is good for a good winter night. Like all hot pot places this place is nothing really special. It is rather small and cramp....cozy would be a nice way to put it.   The food was ok. You can't go wrong with hotpot. The portion size was ok. The only complaint was that the meat was very thinly sliced...I mean paper thin.   Price wise, you can't go wrong with 12.99 or 13.99. If you are not a large eater, this place is better than some of the all you can eat hot pots out there."}
{"text":"For my mini hot pot, I chose the Housemade Porkbone Soup Base, Rice Vermicelli as the staple food, New Zealand Spring Lamb for the meat, and Housemade Sesame Sauce and Housemade Spicy Oil for the dipping sauces.  The included toppings were Boutique luncheon meat, Japanese crab meat, Hong Kong style red sausage, whole shrimp, tofu puff, napa cabbage, lettuce, lotus root, sweet corn, seaweed, and enoki.  I chose the Creamy Thai Coconut Slush for my drink and it was really coconuty and refreshing!  This drink was extremely helpful when it came to dousing down some spicy food that night.  We tried the Fried Pork Chop served with Tartar Sauce.  This was really good fried pork chop; perfectly fried so that it was crispy on the outside and the slices were very thin too.    The Chinese Hot Pepper Chicken (Szechuan Special) was indeed a unique dish.  The pieces of chicken were so tender and moist.  They were topped with green hot peppers sauce which were ma la spicy.  This meant that it left a lot of numbing feeling on the lips after you ate it.  The refreshing cold drinks sure helped to douse the heat for this dish! ^_^  Despite the heat, this snack is a must-try!"}
{"text":"Food: Because this is a sub-restaurant from Morals Village. But the soup base choice is less than Morals Village. They have the single serve toppings for you, but you can also choose additional toppings if you want. And they will charge you from $0.5-$2.5 per pieces. The sauce they give you is just a very small plate. I think you need more. And if you need more sauces, they will charge you. They are only $0.5 per serve, but need to add several times. Although the basic price of the pot is just $12.99 and $13.99, they are not enough and you need to add more ingredients. Then the price will go high. In this case, I'd rather to have a AYCE. Also, because it is a small pot, the soup will gone fast. And you need to add soup just after a while. I ordered a spicy pot, but it became a normal soup and the spicy taste has gone finally.   Service: The service was OK. They have the promotion for 20% off if you share this place to the social media.  Location: The location is easy to find, it's not too far from Pacific mall. There is a Chatime next to the Spicy Mafia"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today.  The place was pretty empty,  we were there from 12.30pm - 2.30pm and there was a total of 10 patrons including us.  We ordered a personal hot pot each.  We ordered the signature spicy soup base  and the pork bone soup base. The soup bases are the best thing about this place,  apart from that,  not much else.  You can't really go wrong with hot pot,  you're cooking food yourself.  Also noticed that you get 2 trays of meat per pot now,  instead of 1. It was filling but still not good value.  The meat is so thin that it's see through.  We also ordered the poached chicken,  side dish.  It wasn't very good looking or tasting and a waste of $5.99. The staff came to refill our pots with broth a few times,  so there was always liquid in the little pot.  We were served a mug of tap water but Chinese speaking customers were given a mug of hot barley tea.  Also,  when we enquired about the 20% discount promo,  we were given a mumbled excuse,  that it doesn't apply to hot pots.  Only applies to a la cart,  like wth?  I thought you only sold hot pots and noodle pots.  I think he was being dishonest because the place is so empty.  Doubt I will ever return again."}
{"text":"Spicy Mafia opened up where the old HOPO (by Chatime) used to be. Same concept but everything comes on the side for you to add yourself instead of already being in the hot pot. All hot pots are $12.99-13.99 before adding additional toppings.  I enjoyed the dinner but felt the meat was lacking, I chose pork and they gave five thin slices, maybe thats why they offer the add-ons for additional cost. The rest of the toppings were decent. You get a choice of three different noodles or rice as your base and two sauces.  Their original spicy (2 chili pepper sign) is actually quite spicy, even for a spicy lover like myself. Their \"mala\" broth - an oily, spicy, and numbing Chinese sauce/broth is indeed ma la. Enjoyed it.  The service was so-so because they lost our order even though the server took the two papers away, but they are still in their soft opening stage, won't deduct any marks for that. They offered us free pop for wasting our time waiting. People who work there are quite nice.  Overall good value for a non-AYCE hot pot restaurant although wish more meat was given in the $12.99 base price without additional toppings. Also wish they didnt run out of a few meat and noodle options (they didnt have beef or rice noodles during Friday dinner hours). Lastly, if you want a better deal, visit them now while they still have their BOGO!"}
{"text":"Location: in the \"Chatime plaza\" -- best way to describe the plaza and exactly the whereabouts of this restaurant entrance. It is right next to the Chatime and makes it a very convenient stop after Hot Pot to grab a drink after.   Parking: Don't worry about parking. We came here on a Friday evening and didn't have any issues.   Atmosphere: Small sized hot pot restaurant and enough to fit 8-10 small tables of 4 seats. Probably best to make reservations first if you are trying to come with a large group. We came with a party of 8 on a random Friday night and they did their best to accommodate us in such a short time frame. Although we sat at 2 separate tables of 4, we were lucky to be seated. There was a lineup waiting outside after.   Service; I would say that the staff was very attentive. We simply filled out our order on a paper menu/place mat. The order just consists of check marked boxes for the choices of soup broth, the type of ingredients, any drinks to add on or other special items that is charged different than the basic menu price.  We had personal hot pot with the gas burners. The staff helped set it up and refill the butane tank if empty. They always came around to check if we needed to fill/top up with more soup broth. They came around to help refill water as well.  I would say that the service was quite good.  They also took into account our 20% discount b/c we showed that we wer part of the MARKHAM FOOD on instagram.   FOOD: I selected the spicy signature broth. The soup was very red in colour and the flavours were quite good in the beginning. After cooking and eating longer, I began to feel like it was too salty. I was given the mixing ingredients to make my sauce but found that I didn't need to use ANY AT ALL b/c the broth had so much flavour. I didn't enjoy the \"NUMBING\" sensation in my mouth when I accidently bit into the peppers. I can't imagine what the other broth selection that has 4 pepper EXTRA SPICY would taste like.   In comparison to the other orders at the table, the pork bone broth seemed to be better for a more simply flavour. After having too much of the spicy broth, I got tired of cooking my food with that flavour and instead used my hubby's hot pot instead. Some friends said the pork bone was \"TOO MILD and tasteless\"... hmm I guess not everyone can be satisfied.   I selected the basic $12.99 ingredients. It only had 7 pieces of beef, a big bowl of my choice of noodles (I chose vermicelli), a piece of shrimp, 2 bean curd, 2 fried tofu, 2 pieces of lotus root and some cabbage and lettuce. Surprisingly, it seemed like so little at first... but as I kept eating, I was quite full already.  I can't say that it was that yummy though.   At least the price was not too costly. But I rather have other HOT POT.  I liked the idea of personalized hotpot, but did not enjoy my broth.   Thank you for your service though. You guys were wonderful and attentive."}
{"text":"Came here the past weekend as we heard about the bogo deal ( buy one get one free ). I tried the classic spicy soup base and those reviews were right about the soup base being extra spicy. I have asked them to make it less spicy and it was still super spicy, I ended up taking all the chilli out and I still could not eat it. My taste buds at this point was gone. The regular hot pot came with basic topping such as lettuce, seaweed, tofu, fish cake, enoki mushroom, red sausage and spam. Mostly one of each. It also came with a side of meat (lamb or angus beef - only a few slices). Also the soup base there were about 5 types (spicy, extra spicy, herbal, pork bone and tomato based). I would prefer the tomato base or pork bone if you cannot take extra spicy. You can add additional toppings for $1.25 or more depending on the type of topping. Overall I probably would not come back if it weren't for the bogo. It's probably better if you go to an all you can eat hot pot for the amount you are paying."}
{"text":"Right now until December 11th it's BOGO free so this was a nice surprise when we visited!  You can either do the hot pot style or the noodle style. We all did the hot pot style. I got the tomato base soup and it was great! Better than the regular pork broth. It comes with 12 different toppings, 2 dipping sauces, and a noodle; but you can add extra toppings for $. The base price is $12.99 regularly. The signature sesame dipping sauce is amazing!! Definitely would recommend.   Some of the staff did not know what they are doing but all of the staff did help us and try to make our experience better. We probably called them over 10+ times to get water, change our gas, refill the soup, and more.   Food was great, but the staff is still getting used to how to serve. We will definitely be coming back again to try their signature spicy broth!"}
{"text":"Long wait tonight around 5:50pm, even with the snow and the early time. We had to wait around half an hour for a three person table. We were told to either wait outside or wait at Chatime next door.  With the buy one get one free, it's a good deal. It runs to less than $10/person after tax and tips if you don't order anything but one pot or one noodle per person. However, that special ended today, so I doubt I'll be desperate to come back.   The food is good, but it's not a steal for what you're paying at regular price ($9.99+ for noodles, and $12.99+ for hot pots). My noodles were a decent portion for me, but the portions here are definitely not big. Their tomato soup is not as sweet or as savory as I'd like. Very tomato-y though. Their hot pots come with a shrimp that's pretty good. Dipping sauce-wise, their garlic in oil is very garlicky, which is good. Chili oil is at the table, for those of you who don't want to use one of your two free hot pot sauces on chili oil.   Um...Oh. It's quite cramped in here. When they separate all the tables (like a four person table becomes two separate two person tables), there might not be enough space to walk between tables. That's no fun. They might grab an extra chair from your table without warning too, if there is one. They also need more servers for the kind of service they're providing. It was not the easiest flagging down a server tonight, although when we did have a server, they were fairly attentive.   If I want noodles with a whole ton of toppings, I'd rather go to A Xiang or Primary Taste. Bigger portions. Cheaper prices."}
{"text":"Went at lunch.  Not too busy.  Good service.  Waitress explained how things worked.  Food came quickly.  Got mala soup and pork bone soup noodle.  Mala soup was right level of spicy but too salty for my taste.  Pork bone soup was just right.  Rich and flavorful.  We got 8 thin slices of pork each with our rice noodle.  Pot also came with half egg, some veggies and sausage.  Lots of noodle.  Portion will make you full.    Fun concept.  Aiming for the young bubbletea crowd.  For $10, i prefer wonton noodle or ramen.  But neat concept for cold winter days.  Fun gathering place for the younger crowd.  Especially since it's tight next to chatime.  They are doing 20% off promo if you share on fb or social media."}
{"text":"I came here last Sunday in a group of four people. There were quite a few people, however we came just as a group left so we were seated right away.   I got the sweet tomato pork bone soup (I had it from morals hot pot their other restaurant), two of my friends had the original pork bone soup, and lastly the Chinese Angelica soup.   My sweet tomato soup, was not as good as the old they had at morals unfortunately. You also get free refills on carbs, however when they refill your soup they use a standard soup base broth which I found strange because it not only changed the colour of my soup but the flavour as well.   I do think that the meat quality is pretty good, nothing amazing. However the price is really reasonable and they're doing a promotion of 20% off the entire bill if you post on social media (it can be only one person who posted). I posted on Snapchat so I think any form of social media is expectable.   All in all, it was an okay experience. I would come back again :)"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend on a weekday because we were craving hotpot.  I had the sweet tomato pork bone soup here... it was a bit different from traditional hot pot because they offered a mini hot pot option which I would say is enough for 1 person. There were different kinds of fish balls, vegetables and beef.   Pros: It's a good experience because you have your own mini pot with your own sauces and food. The portion size was small so I was able to finish the amount I had because I usually cannot eat that much during traditional hot pot.  Cons: I feel like for the size and what you're getting, it's not worth it. The food seemed like regular food you can get from the frozen section of the grocery store.   Would I recommend this place? I like the overall idea and portion size which attracted me to come here in the first place but I think after the 1 time, I prefer traditional hot pot."}
{"text":"Spicy Mafia is a la carte hotpot restaurant and you get your own little pot and food items so you don't have to share. It's super cute! It's great for when you want to hotpot, but you don't eat enough to get a good value out of the all-you-can-eat hotpot places.   The price is about 9.99 for the noodle combo and 12.99 for their mini hotpot combo, both of which come with a variety of toppings, and are enough to feed one person of average appetite. For the mini hotpot combo, just a word of warning, it comes with only four slices of meat, but you can always order more for a price. It also comes with your choice of a selection of noodle types or rice.   If you enjoy spicy foods, you must try their Exclusive Spicy Soup Base which is rated four hot peppers. FOUR! However, if you're like me and can't handle too much heat, I really enjoyed their Chinese Angelica Soup Base which has a Chinese Herb Medicine taste to it (it's not for everyone but I LOVE). I also tried the Sweet Tomato Soup Base which was viscous, tomato-ey and flavourful.  I also recommend the kiwi juice which I don't see on menus very often. It is a sweet and refreshing drink that has actual kiwi in it.   If you find it difficult to find parking in the plaza, there is underground parking, the entrance is beside Dayali in the plaza."}
{"text":"Spicy Mafia is perfect on a super cold Toronto winter.  Opened just recently at the border of Markham and Scarborough, I gave Spicy Mafia a try around Christmas time.  Spicy Mafia is not your AYCE hotpot you see everywhere, they do a la carte style which I was pretty happy with.  For around 14$ per pot that comes with your choice of noodle, one meat side and a bowl of mixed toppings, it's a pretty good deal and enough food for one person.  Soup bases are great here, and if you like spicy soup base, they have great selections as well.  Only negative I would say about the a la carte is the meat, it only comes with 4 slices of SUPER THIN meat, which when you put them in the pot, they break apart easily.  I was recommended by one of the servers to try their signature Szechuan chicken which you can order as a side dish. When it came, it didn't look to appealing because of this green sauce thing on top of the chicken but I LOVED IT!! The Szechuan spicy is amazing and I love how it numbs your lips after eating it!  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here with the intention of a cheap hot pot experience. Turns out that it's not as cheap as I thought. Even though they advertise 20% off your order, they only apply to \"optional items\".   The food is good, but it's pretty basic. For a quick hot pot fix it's OK."}
{"text":"Had a very fun experience! The owner and waitress were awesome!! They gave my friend free rice since his soup was too spicy. Would definitely come here again"}
{"text":"Came here two times now. The first was during their grand opening when they had their bogo and the second time was because I won a giveaway.   My mom got the pork bone soup and my dad got the spicy soup (the one with two chilli). The spicy one is REALLY SPICY . For the giveaway, I got the mala tang which was a 5 min customized bowl, where I got to choose between 4 soup base and 39 toppings. They would then weigh it and cook it in 5 mins and I believe it's $8.99/lb. The toppings were inside a fridge, all lined up nice and tidy but I think it would've been useful if they had labels next to them so people would know what some of the toppings were. My parents and I also shared 2 tea eggs ($1.99 each), which tasted quite salty and didn't have much tea taste to it. Not sure if this was also part of the giveaway but they also gave me the option to choose between chicken nuggets or pork cutlets, so I chose the pork cutlets.   Service was A+. The servers were attentive on refilling our soup and checking up on us. I was quite surprised that it was pretty busy for a Monday night at around 7pm."}
{"text":"The ambience was great. The food was okay, probably not the best ramen place I have been to but proximity to u of t makes it a great place to chill out with friends."}
{"text":"Individual hotpot & other spicy noodle dishes. Came on a Saturday night after 9pm and it was empty... but this place is not bad! Good choice for when you're craving hotpot but don't have appetite for AYCE.  Got the basic combo $12.99 - choice of soup base, meat, noodle, 2 sauces + 11 items including veggies, shrimp & red sausage. Pork bone soup was creamy and tasty and they gave frequent refills of soup. The fresh rice noodle was good with the soup and the beef (8 slices) was good too! I chose the garlic oil and sesame sauce made in house but you don't really need dipping sauce, probably order just cilantro if I come back. We added an order of fish balls, which were bad."}
{"text":"I kept seeing instagram pics of this place so I decided to go. I knew it wasn't an AYCE type of hot pot place from reading all the reviews.  Here's how it works, every person gets their own.  1 pick your broth 2 pick your vermicelli, noodle, rice or udon 3 pick your two sauce options 4 pick your meat (pork, beef, lamb) 5 check off any additional food items you might want, but it comes with lotus root, radish, lettuce, one shrimp, one frozen tofu, 2 rolled up bean curd, 1/4 corn, enoki mushrooms, red sausage, luncheon meat, and a tofu puff (maybe more but can't remember).   You cook it all and that's that.  We had the pork bone soup and the first spicy one on the list. Both broths were good.  Service was above average, wait staff are pretty attentive and refill the broth when it gets to low levels - they keep a close eye on this.  My only complaint is that the meat portion which come with the combo are soo small. It's something like 8 slices of meat the size of half the width a $5 bill and just as thin. This pretty much forces you to order more and that's an additional $2.50 (prices may vary later) per serving.   The mini hot pot also doesn't let you put a lot of food in at once, so it takes a bit of time to cook the lotus root, radish and corn. I wish the pot was a bit bigger or deeper. Most of all, I wished they would just give you more meat from the start.  It also looks like, in trying to deter people from sharing sauces or food, they don't give you a bowl to eat from. Yes, no empty bowl. So the piping hot food comes out of the hot pot, onto the spoon (maybe?) and then dipped in sauces and into your mouth? I could see burning yourself with the food to be an issue.   This place is decent for a well rounded meal.  Not good if you enjoy a ton of meat for hot pot. For more meat I would rather go to an AYCE place. Also I should add, for four people where we ordered a few more items and drinks the bill was about $100 which is only a few dollars off from an AYCE place."}
{"text":"This used to be the location for HoPo, and now it's spicy mafia.  This is a non AYCE individual hot pot place that has a decent selection of hot pot ingredients. Service was very friendly, and helpful in explaining how things worked.  We got one pork bone broth and one herbal. Both were decent but didn't knock my socks off.   Overall a decent little place that has some intriguing art work for decor, but I may stick to some AYCE hot pot places for some more variety."}
{"text":"As much as I would like to give Spicy Mafia a higher rating, I can't.  But let's start with the good stuff. Spicy Mafia is located in the Chatime/Sweet Esc plaza at Gibson and Warden. The restaurant is right beside Chatime in the far corner of the plaza. They definitely put effort into the design and interior of Spicy Mafia - it's modern and kinda quirky. Quite cramped though - we ended up having to share a table by the window and every time I got up I had to make the poor lady on the outside edge of the table get up too.  We came to try the customizable noodle bowls and there's quite an impressive range of things to choose from. Different types of fish/beef balls, meats (red sausage, mini regular sausages), tofu, bean sprouts, bean curd sheets, yam noodles, mushrooms (shiitake, enoki, black fungi), different kinds of noodles, etc. - about 40 to choose from in all so you can customize to your heart's content. You put what you want in a large bowl using the same tongs - if you're allergic  be wary of cross-contamination. Then they weigh it - it's 8.99 a pound. Deceptively expensive - I'm a small eater and with about two pounds that was enough. The bowl also weighs 0.2 pounds which they inform you of beforehand.  Then they go ahead and make your noodles, and the bowls came pretty quickly. We got the pork bone soup base, which I liked. Even though this is more expensive, I was liking the freshness of the ingredients and the huge variety. Unfortunately today we got more protein than we bargained for.  As we kept eating I noticed a fly floating in my soup. No big deal. It happens. We informed the server and he was apologetic and came back and told us they'd replaced the soup and reboiled it. After this hiccup we kept on with our meal until Michael discovered a beetle on his udon. It would have been cute even if it hadn't been in his food. Again we called the server over and we were told that this was a sesame seed.  1) There is zero sesame anywhere in the dish or in any of their regular hot pot bowls for that matter. 2) Sesame seeds are round, but taper at the ends and are flat. This is clearly a beetle. With legs clearly visible I might add.  So again they came back with a new soup base and reboiled. Then I found fly number 2 in my soup and at this point I just fish it out and give up.   Throughout all this service was quite courteous and I appreciated that. They told us at the end of our meal that it was likely the watercress that was the source of all these bugs and I certainly think that's true. That doesn't mean it's acceptable for there to be multiple insects in my food (and I took a minimal amount of watercress). If they're going to have vegetables available they should either wash it well enough or pick a vegetable that is easier to clean and won't have as many insects in them. I have watercress all the time in my own house for hot pot and there has never been an insect even once.  They did give us a discount. +20% for sharing on social media. It came out to about 15 dollars for both bowls which is a perfectly reasonable price.. for an insect-less meal. Even without the insects, I think Spicy Mafia is too expensive for what it's worth.  So yeah. If you're going to come here don't get any leafy vegetables."}
{"text":"With the cold weather, the boyfriend and I chose hot pot. Not knowing they were doing BOGO, that was extra nice. They have been opened for 2 months so they are still on their soft opening phase.  The waitress we had was super friendly and helpful. She went through the menu with us and let us know what was included and what was extra costs (I know it says on the menu but it was just nice!), she also had recommendations which we went with - Chicken something, came with a green paste - DELICIOUS! It felt homemade and we both enjoyed this dish, $5.99. Forgot the name, sorry. I took a picture of it though :)  We got the Tomato soup base and the Pork soup base. Both full of flavour, a little salty to drink, but great with the food. Sadly we didnt get to try their Beef as it was not prepared yet. We only had the choice of Lamb or Pork, we both went with Lamb. Everything was FRESH. We were pleasantly surprised. Don't get why Japanese udon was $1 more, but we got it anyway.  Each meat plate comes with only 4 slices - a lot less from the advertised photo on yelp. An additional mest plate also only comes with 4 slices and for $2.50 - pretty pricy, imo. But with the BOGO, we thought we'd just use the extra money and got two more plates.   We also got drinks: a wintermelon tea - a little too sweet, and a lemon black tea - recommended, so yummy! I think the bf said the drinks were like $5 which is almost half of the hot pot itself, pretty expensive if you compare it like that. But no compliants on my end cause they give you $5 worth. I had the drink from beginning to end, normally it would be gone half way through.  The bill ran us $40 in the end, not bad for a weekend. We enjoyed our meal, the company of each other, and we were full. NOTE: THIS IS NOT AN ALL YOU CAN EAT. I think the idea is pretty neat. The pots are quite small so you cant throw everything in like you, well, i, normally do. Soup runs out fast too, but they come by for soup refulls pretty often.  Overall I would say it is a solid 3 star. I gave an additional star because the waitress did an awesome job!"}
{"text":"There aren't many meat options besides the meat balls and Lunch meat.  The place looks nice but it's very crowded. It's very straight forward. You just go in and grab w.e item you want and then they will make it for you. If you like spicy then make sure that you go for the hottest one. I chose little medium spicy and I didn't find it spicy at all. I wish they have a menu option. So that you don't always have to pick your own. Overall it's a great location to go to if your hungry after school."}
{"text":"I came on Saturday and was quite sad that this replaced HOPO which also did individual hotpots. Firstly, the place was busy and so we had to share a table. This was super awkward given when we sat down, the other customers were unaware that we would be sharing the table with them. We proceeded to order the hot pot meals ($12.99) and this was when dinner got even worse. We waited a good 30 minutes and when the food arrived, they did not get the right soup base for my friend. This resulted in more waiting time and having to ask for the soups whereabouts. Some of the servers were quite untrained and impolite while there was a few who were helpful. However, I would say it was quite a mess because when we got the soup, we realized the meat was missing. This started the next wait until we could finally start eating. To makes matters worse, when we got the bill, they decided to tell us that the debit machine broke and they need us to pay in cash which none of us had on hand.... Did we dine and dash? Obviously not ! However, we had to then leave a person behind to drive to the bank for cash. Overall, food was decent but the experience was terrible."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of ramen but lover of spicy food. This place have a serious spicy broth. Similar to a hotspot place, you pick your toppings like fish balls, vegetables, noodles and such, than you proceed to the counter and you may request for more protein option, broth and herbs like cilantro or green onions. You will get your spoon and chopsticks, pick a table (communal) and you wait for the meal to come to you. Food taste is good, nice presentation. This place used to be Tera Lab Japanese modern food. Decor is still the same. I would come back again.   Signature spicy soup Certified angus beef Pop  Optional items( from the fridge) Hst ------ $14.17"}
{"text":"I'd say more of a 3.5/5 to be fair.  I came here for dinner on Sunday around 7PM and it was about half full. We were seated right away and throughout the evening it did get quite busy, mostly with the younger Chinese crowd.  Our server briefly described the menu to us (the combos).. for about $13-14 you can get a selection of a soup base (Tomato, Chinese herbal, Pork Bone), a choice of noodles (rice noodle, instant noodle, udon), a choice of meat (8 pcs of beef, lamb or pork) and two sauces (garlic, scallions, peanut sauce, etc). All of the combos come with a bowl of assorted toppings (veggies, potato slices, tofu, luncheon meat, red sausage, 1 shrimp, imitation cram meat).. just a piece of everything. You have the option of adding extras of anything with an additional $1.5+up. We added a side of quail eggs (4 pcs) for $1.50.   Our food came in no time; the price for the portions is quite decent, except you can tell that they do give you the lowest quality of all (they advertise Nissin instant noodles....what we receive were definitely not!!... and the luncheon meat was def low quality).  This was a fun experience for personal hotpot, very affordable and definitely a good option if you do not want to deal with the aftermath of washing the dishes and pots at home!!  They do offer a handful of drinks served in cute mason jars..but why not walk over to Chatime next door and get something more delicious? :)"}
{"text":"So the new noodle restaurant in the plaz,a was recently opened. There's two choices of how you can eat. The first option is the hot pot combo, they give you personal little stoves and small pots and set dishes that you can eat. The other option is pick your own noodle! There's a shelf of different options and foods to add to your noodle, with a large variety to choose from. Fish balls, beef balls, pork balls, bean sprouts, watercrest, insects, tofu, tofu puffs, pork blood, udon, instant noodle, vermicelli, bamboo shoot, oh and did I forget to mention insects?  The soup bases are pretty interesting, like spicy esctasy soup, classic chong dong style soup, coconut laksa, pickled cabbage, and housemade pork bone soup. You can choose extra meats on the side and drinks. Pricing goes 8.99 per pound.  Now onto the eating, so me and my partner-in-crime Katie, we both got our food and it came all hit and ready for us! The food smelt great and the bowls were nice to look at. Then they appeared. There was a dead fly in her bowl just floating around. Without making a big deal, we hailed a waitress and she took it, replaced the soup. Then I started eating mine. I took a nice big chopstick full of udon and rolled it up on to a spoon. And sitting on the top of my noodle mound?!? A cute little beetle. I called the waitress over, and she got her manager. He promptly told me it was just sesame. So he went back to behind the counter and the waitress returned. I picked up the beetle and placed it on tissue. Took a picture of it, showed the waitress and said, this sesame oddly has legs. She quickly apologized and took the bowl and replaced the udon and soup. Let me remind you that means the other food in contact with said insect was still contaminated. At this point ive lost all my appetite. We got the bill and the manager gave us one soup and drink on the house. With an additional 20% off for Instagram post, it was roughly 15 dollars. The manager explained that it was probably the watercrest, which means they didn't take care to wash it enough.   Service gets a 4/5, atmosphere was 2/5 (we had to share a table), food0/5  Unacceptable.      1 million years dungeon."}
{"text":"Cute date spot. Fun little individual got out. And great if you love spicy food. However the food was just too spicy for me to get the spicy broth. I tried the more subtle broth.   More fun then tasty to be honest. But I gotta say. It was closer to a 4 than a 3 because of  1) fun date spot 2) great music 3) cool mural"}
{"text":"Awesome little place with nice decor and atmosphere. $12.99 for a pot is super reasonable when u compare to a bowl of pho that has 4 slices of beef and is $8.99. Not sure why everyone complains. I was here on a busy Friday night and servers were really attentive. Everyone in the restaurant looked like they were enjoying themselves. It's too bad they are not on yelp to give this place a fairer rating. Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"I would have given it a 3 stars coz the food was semi-decent, if only they were a little more flexible! Due to food allergy me and my friend couldn't eat shrimp so we had ordered the combo that came with shrimp. We had simply request for instead of shrimp to substitute perhaps tofu? But the waitress just simply said no! How hard is it to take out shrimp and add something else due to an allergy to seafood! Super unaccommodating! The Hotpot is way too small! It boils over without even putting a lot of stuff in the pot!  Last complain, upon requesting for the bill and showing the waiter our social media posts that entitles us to a 20% discount per advertisement at each table the guy had the audacity to say only for make your own bowl of noodles and NOT the Hotpot combo! Wtf?!? Where does it say that? Eventually they gave it to us coz we were going to be taken for no fools! Doubt I'll return! Especially after reading all the bugs posts on here!"}
{"text":"I didn't have too high of an expectation when my friend took a few of us here. This place offers each person a mini hot pot and they do not offer AYCE. If you just order the basic menu, it comes with a choice of soup base (I had the pork bone soup and it was just alright. I didn't taste any pork in the soup and I gotta be honest it was probably just MSG and lots of salt). You also get to choose a type of protein, either lamb, pork or beef... I had the beef and my friend had lamb... it was nothing amazing like other fancy hot pot places and the portion was really small... if you are a guy and if you eat a lot of protein, do not come here. The set menu also comes with a small bowl of mixed items like a few pieces of spam, red sausages, tofu, seaweed, a shrimp, imitate crab and some cabbage... We didn't order anything extra coz the set menu was a good portion for a tiny person like me. I would not recommend this place if you are a fan of Morals Village or other fancy AYCE hot pot places. If you are on a budget or just want to give it a try, sure why not.. otherwise I'd give this place a 2 star.  Overall: 2/5 Food: 2/5 Value:4/5 Location:3/5 Service:2/5 Ambiance:2/5  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Delicious hotpot on a cold day to keep you warm! It is located right next to the Chatime store and the design is a bonus for those who love some interior to your meal!"}
{"text":"BOGO is a great deal! As I am really doubtful if I would be paying $12.99 for a mini hotpot with hardly anything in it.  If you are a big eater, going for Moral Village all you can eat option might be better off. I can personally finish 2 orders by myself with no problem.   I do love the concept and their spicy soup bases: Even their 2 chili Signature Spicy Soup Base might be a little too spicy for some but they do have option to make it less spicy or salty. The vegetables and sides were clean and fresh! The meat (Angus Beef/New Zealand Spring Lamb) was sliced really thinly.   We ended up order some extra items: Napa Cabbage, Bean Curd Skin and Chaozhou Stuffed Fishball (3 balls/$1.50) but the portion is small.   Most staff speaks Mandarin/English but the most helpful staff speaks Cantonese/Mandarin/English and he is amazing!"}
{"text":"A small trendy hot pot place for the millennials but indeed you can have a family dinner here. The art work on the wall appears hip and a taste of Asia.   You get your own little pot with some meat and lots of veggies. Indeed there are choices that can be made from their reusable menu used with a dry-erase marker. If you want to add more, it will cost you more than just $12-13. It's a pretty good deal for a hearty warm meal since winter is freezing cold here!!  It's not all you can eat, but your tummy would be pleased.   Happy:  You get your own pot which is different than sharing a big one at other hot pot places. The service was decent for an Asian place.   Not happy:  The portion of veggies are not the same and my bowl had one less veggie than my partner. At the end, my soup base got too hot for me so before which base you get.  The complimentary hot tea is not hot at all. The wintermelon juice is a bit too sweet to my taste. I diluted with the tea.   Verdict:  I wished it was open on Mississauga. I would definitely go more often!! You can take your time to eat, cook, socialize and have fun. So glad I tried it!! (If you have room, Chatime is just beside it)."}
{"text":"Spicy Mafia is from the same team behind both Kaka AYCE and Morals Village. I had the pleasure of attending a tasting at Spicy Mafia during their soft opening, and enjoyed an intimate mini hot pot meal. The concept at Spicy Mafia is similar to Morals Village Hot Pot except it's not AYCE. Rather, the meal is DIY, and each diner gets their own personal hot pot complete with a pre-arranged assortments of items. However, you are free to add more items for extra costs.   Spicy Mafia is housed in the previous HOPO spot and its interior is very bold and modern with lots of prints. There are also a few mafia themed motifs throughout the restaurant including writings on the servers' shirts. It's very fitting considering its name. We started off the night with some snacks, Chicken Nuggets served with Tartar Sauce ($3.99) and Cold Noodle Mixed with Spicy Sauce ($5.99). I am not a fan of cold noodles, but the ones here was pretty good, as the sauce added quite a kick.  Prices start at $12.99 for your choice of soup base, one item from staple food, one meat item, and two dipping sauce. The mini hot pot set comes with all the following topping items; luncheon meat, Japanese crab meat, Hong Kong style red sausage, while shrimp, tofu puff, Napa cabbage, lettuce, lotus root, sweet corn, seaweed, and enoki.   Unlike the large soup bases menu at Morals, there are only five options for soup bases at Spicy Mafia. The newest soup base is the healthier option, Chinese Angelica Soup Base. For meats, you have the option to choose from the following; New Zealand Spring Lamb, Pork Slice, Certified Angus Beef Slice. Each portion comes with four to five slices, but you can always order more meat plates for an additional $2.50 each.   For my hot pot, I opted for the signature spicy soup base, Japanese udon (+$1), certfied Angus beef slice, and housemade sesame sauce and housemade spicy oil as my sauces. The signature spicy soup base is my go-to soup base at Morals Village, so I definitely wanted it as my soup base.  For my drink order, I got the Creamy Thai Coconut Slush, which was refreshing considering the spicy soup base that I chose. I'd say that the overall meal was affordable especially given the quality of the food. It would have been nice to have a little more meat slices, but the extra cost isn't too bad for more. I had a lot of fun with the hot pot concept, and the meal was just right - I was not too full nor too hungry. Spicy Mafia is a good alternative to hot pot if your appetite isn't up for AYCE hot pot, as that can get pretty pricey, especially if you're not that hungry.

{"text":"Visited the place last night, the service was great. It's my second time after they changed their name. we found the ingredient is not fresh, one of the luncheon meat comes with the noodle soup we order has mold."}
{"text":"I don't usually write complaints but last night really irritated me. The deciding factor on visiting Spicy Mafia for dinner was that they were advertising 20% discount your entire bill if you post on social media (there was no fine print or exclusions anywhere on the website). Both myself and dining partner got their mini personal hotpots. As we finished we asked for the bill and mention that we posted on social media for the 20% off. The server proceeds to tell us that the 20% discount is only for their new menu item which is the DIY soup noodles.  I go back on their website to double check, just to make sure the I didn't misread or miss something and again, there was no fine print anywhere. The server wouldn't honour the 20% discount, I paid unhappily and left.   If it weren't for the 20% discount promotion I saw on their website, I wouldn't have even chosen to eat at Spicy Mafia. The food was average, nothing special. I got the regular spicy soup base which was mouth numbing, I couldn't taste 80% of my meal but the regular pork broth was okay.  I wouldn't say the service or food was bad but I wouldn't go back anytime soon. I would much rather eat traditional family style hotpot from Kim Tao.   I still feel somewhat scammed."}
{"text":"Im being generous giving them 3 stars...  there was a line up when i went and it was really cramped waiting by the doors watching other ppl eat.   this was more of a novelty restaurant to me.  You get your own little pot which is neat .. but the ingredients they give you are pretty crappy.   one thing is for sure.  your going to leave this place with your clothes smelling like hot pot."}
{"text":"How it works: 1) Grab an empty bowl & tongs 2) Pick out your meats, veggies, and noodles  3)Bring it to the cashier. Choose your soup, spiciness, & extra toppings (extra cost for the toppings). They'll weigh your bowl and charge you accordingly (debit & cash only!) 4) Grab a seat & relax until they bring you your hot bowl of goodies!   //THE FOOD// I thought the soup was flavourful enough & not too thin. The selection of toppings was good! There's a bunch of fish/meat balls, quail eggs, veggies, etc.  For a filling bowl, it rang out to be ~$11 which is pretty nice given that I got to pick exactly what I wanted !"}
{"text":"I have been itching to try this place since it opened. The concept seemed so attractive. I went with my family on a Saturday night. So the basic premises of the hot pot is that there are individual pots, and a set menu of food for the price of $12.99. You pick the soup base, the kind of meat, the type of carbs, and there is a set for everything else you would get. I ordered the Housemade Pork Bone Soup, side order of lamb, and vermicelli, the thicker kind.  When the food arrived, everything was set up nicely. Each person had about 8 pieces of meat, and smaller quantity of everything else. The table next to us had a table full of food, they probably had to order a lot of extra food.   I started cooking my food, and I noticed the broth was very flavourful. To me the broths were on the saltier side (and my mom would not stop commenting on it). At normal hot pot places, when they need to add to your soup, they normally add boiling water. But here, they give you more broth. Which would have been good if the original brother wasn't so salty. My mom ended up asking them for water to dilute the broth. I didn't dilute the broth, but I did drink a lot of water because of the broth.  In my opinion, it's really nothing special. I don't eat a lot/big appetite (in terms of quantity) but this set left me in limbo, I wasn't full, but I wasn't hungry either. I am not sure whether the sets would be satisfying for others whom eat a little more.   I don't think I would be returning here any time soon."}
{"text":"My 3 girlfriends and I went on a Friday night around 8 pm and it was moderately packed, but we still got a seat right when we got there. We were a little confused at what was going on with the menu, as they had the individual hot pots on one side of the menu, and another section in the back of the store near the where you choose your own toppings, and they make it for you in the back and calculate the cost based on weight.   We ended up going with the individual hot pots. You choose a base, the noodles, the meat and then the dipping sauce (2 free and $0.50 for each extra one you choose). Afterwards, you can add additional toppings for an extra price. I made the mistake not reading what they had in the \"included toppings\" section and ordered extra toppings that were already in the combo.... oops.   3 of us chose the \"signature spicy soup base\" and when it came, all of us regretted it. Despite only having two hot pepper symbol, it was extremely spicy, especially with all the peppercorn and chilies!! I know the name of the restaurant is \"spicy mafia\" but I still got caught off guard. Usually, I love super spicy food, but it was the tongue-numbing kind of spicy from Szechuan, which I did not like at all. The more the pot boiled, the more spicy it got, so all 3 of us ended up taking out all the chilies and peppercorn within 5 minutes of getting the soup, which helped in containing the spiciness. I cannot imagine what the \"Exclusive spicy soup base\" with four pepper symbols, so order with caution!!!!  Overall, all of us were super stuffed with just the basic included toppings with a lot left over. The price was just around $20 for a whole hot pot meal. The service was very fast and friendly as well, and the cool decor was just the cherry on top."}
