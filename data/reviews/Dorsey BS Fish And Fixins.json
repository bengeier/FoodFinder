{"text":"Amazing Fish will be back again. The owner is also a real gem who just makes you feel at home from the moment you walk in to the moment you depart. Hope this new fish joint takes off."}
{"text":"Did you ever go someplace that was so bad you didn't even want to Yelp about it......This is the only restaurant I have ever been too that I didn't even want to Yelp about. The only reason I am is because the only truthful review about this place was filtered out so I feel the need to tell it like it was.


Short story- After one taste of everything we threw the food out and ate someplace else.

Longer story-


Dorsey B's Fish and Fixings is located in an older strip mall right by or might what is considered Old Town Glendale. There's a woman there who takes your order and prepares the food herself. She is very pleasant to talk to and is very conversational. I don't know but it seems the owner was a celebrity at one time of some sort because there are many glamor photos of the owner there.

This is an older restaurant and before this one was here many other restaurants failed. It's not fancy or anything. We ordered, paid and eventually our orders arrive.

I taste the Red Snapper. It's coated in unseasoned cornmeal. The fish was freezer burnt and is a strange texture and taste old. Next I try the Macaroni and cheese. The Macaroni is gooey and the cheese taste like watered down Velveta. My other side was Sweet Potatoes. They taste like they have been out of the can for a long time. Even the tarter sauce is runny and not good.

As horrible as my platter was my husband's White Fish Platter was even worse!

The White Fish was so freezer burnt it was hard dry and crunchy also coated in plain unseasoned corn meal. I tasted a Hush Puppy and I had to spit it out. It was not edible. My husband told me not to even try the red beans and rice he said they were sour.

It seemed like the refrigeration and freezers are in need of repair and someone with better cooking skills should be in charge of preparing food.

This food was unacceptable and not edible. 
After tasting everything we threw the food out. We left and ate someplace else.



This was among the very worst food experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"Catfish, collard greens, and yams!  Yuuum!  @Dorsey B's Fish and Fixins!  SWC of 59th and Olive. First time here but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food is cooked to order, the catfish nuggets are my fav with that creamy Mac and greens im not from the south but this food makes me want to visit for sure"}
{"text":"The restaurant was very clean, and decorated with a lot of colorful art as well. I love how she had the business cards visible on the tables underneath a clear top. The fish basket and the hush puppies were by far the best I have ever tasted since being in Mississippi where I am from. And she has satisfied my cravings of fish so much I went back twice in one night!"}
{"text":"My mom took me here for lunch for my birthday and it was so good! I had the snapper, greens and hush puppies. My mom had catfish, Mac n cheese and red beans and rice. We shared everything and it was AMAZING! The staff is awesome. They were so sweet and generous. They were awesome. Literally only negative is my snapper was a bit dry. Everything down to the hot sauce is delicious."}
