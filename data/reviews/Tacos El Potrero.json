{"text":"Love this place. Tacos were $1.50 or $2 for supreme(cheese and sour cream). I got the supreme asada and they were crazy good. They are cash only. I also got the asada fries to share with my boyfriend and it was okay. The fries tasted a little fishy. Kind of like they weren't fried in fresh oil. Won't get them again. But I will definitely be back for the tacos."}
{"text":"OMG, these tacos are the best I have ever tasted in the US, I come from Mexico and it felt like home. The pambazos, sopes, & flautas are so good especially the pastor supreme burrito!!!! The green salsa is better than any other salsa I've tried, it is not your watered down salsa. i also asked for xtra toppings on my regular tacos and did not get charged (they told me they only charge for the supreme ones) but of the 4 days I came to eat out of the 7 I was in town I did not have a bad experience. I come every 4 months and decided to now give me them a great review! They have low prices, and the quality of the food is great! Portion is good too if you want more you can ask for it and pay an extra price :) Will definitely come back again! And I recommend others to try it out for their own experience!!"}
{"text":"One of the best tacos I have tried in Vegas their salsas are amazing and spicy. Honestly if you like tacos you have to try this place"}
{"text":"-HAPPY TACO TUESDAY!!  Wowwww, just wow!!!  We ordered 30 chicken and 15 steak tacos today. We WILL be back! The meat was soooo soft and marinated & and the salsa was DELICIOUS! We just moved from Michigan to Las Vegas and Tacos El Potrero is now our go to taco spot!!!   ((And the family is so nice!!! Very sweet to me on the phone and very helpful towards my husband when he went to pick up our order!))  Thanks again!!! The food was AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"We pulled up and they turned the lights off before we could walk over. An hour earlier than posted (11pm - supposed to close at midnight). Boo"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place!!! We tried the chains out here and weren't too satisfied. Being from Los Angeles, we're pretty picky with our Mexican food. The food here is ALWAYS fresh and most importantly, yummmmmaaaaay!!! The torta is not greasy and the carne asada fries are delish! This place is always our go to when we can't seem to make up our minds about what we want to eat. Try it! You're going to love it"}
{"text":"The food is actually not bad.  Not the best, but definitely not bad.  The reason i only gave them 3 stars is , because they are VERY GREEDY with their salsa.  No matter how much you spend,  they dont want to part ways with it!  So weird!  I've even offered to pay extra for more salsas with my order,  and you can tell by their facial expressions they are bothered by it.  Also they have messed up our order twice.   On both occasions we didnt notice until we got home.  We were short tacos both times.    Probably won't be back for these reasons."}
{"text":"This is the best taco truck I have been found, try out few taco trucks before. The tacos are awesome . especially all foods serving are so clean in order. Definitely recommend for neighborhood and tourists too."}
{"text":"Went by today and the truck is no longer there and was no answer on the phone. Not sure if they had an event to go to but I haven't seen them"}
{"text":"You have to try this!  OK.  It's a permanent food truck.  Original! Mexican tacos.  Carne Asada, Al Pastor, ... my favorite Lengua.. so tender. Don't be so pretentious.  Just park the car and enjoy."}
{"text":"OMG THE PAMBAZO WAS REALLY GOOOOD!!! Never had one, to my cousins In Vegas this is a place you need to try! Coming from Berdoo CA, wish we had them out there! Btw bring cash guys, no ATM's.... Yet? Lol"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The Carne asada has phenomenal flavor to it and the green sauce is spicy and flavorful!! The service is great, owners are very friendly. I never get tired of coming here."}
{"text":"I am very iffy when it comes to eating at food trucks and Mexican restaurants so today I thought I try this place as I seen alot of positive reviews so I thought I give it a chance and I wasn't disappointed the Carne asada burrito I got was really good it made my mouth melt it was that good. The fries were good not great they kind of remind me of those crinkled fries from the grocery store that you buy at smiths still good though the prices here are reasonable and they always have deals going on overall this place will probably end up being my go to place as the food here pretty much won me over."}
{"text":"How do you charge for onions & cilantro? What comes on the tacos where you come from?   Maybe I'm just spoiled by the taco trucks in LA. It wasn't bad by any means, but nothing I would rave about.   Again, maybe I'm biased, but the portions weren't big to me. There could have been more meat in my tacos and there could have been more burrito to my burrito.   And they were super stingy with the salsa. I've never in my experience known salsa to be a bank breaker and I cannot take people who try to control my condiment intake. Especially with enough food for 2 people and 1 salsa for each of us."}
{"text":"The food was good quality and the service was good. To start, the most recent order, things off their flyer menu were to be ordered and the prices on the flyer are wrong. And they don't even honor the prices that are on the flyer. It is still wrong as of late. The portions are definitely good too. I want to definitely return and I can't wait to see any improvements they make when I return, I'll check the prices and adjust review accordingly."}
{"text":"The tacos were really good, the only thing is that they were smaller than I expected but other than that it was very tasty. My bf got the pambazo with chorizo and patatos and that was delicious, a good size too."}
{"text":"Great food great customer service, if you are on the go and in the mood for good Mexican food this is a good spot. Although its not a restaurant and they are located right next to the spring valley market you won't regret stopping by. Would definitely go by again."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town I go there all the time, everyone is friendly and prices are great quick place to grab something to eat"}
{"text":"I'm not exaggerating when I say that I have a severe love for tacos... And when I found it this place is only right up the street from my house? I had to try it out. And thank God I did because these are some of the best tacos I've ever had. Everything about the meat to the tortillas have so much flavor!! There flautas are very light and crispy with a lot of meat inside of them. And the co-pays are just to die for. And both of their red and green sauces have a competition with my taste buds every time I tried them. They are both to die for!! I literally eats there probably three times a week I've recommended tons of friends here and they all have said the same exact thing, the best tacos I've ever had!!!!"}
{"text":"The best tacos & boritos in town for sure! Me & husband are in love with their carne asada tacos and the supreme cesadia! Their food is fresh, homemade style that taste deliciously! Don't waste your money buying from big chain companies, this family business worth every penny! And I say it because of their good costumer service & tasty food!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place after driving by them for the last year and a half. Not really a taco truck but more like a small trailer that you can tow. Judging by the size of it, makes you wonder how they can make whatever you decide to get tasty.  For my first visit, I got 3 tacos ($1.50 each). I got Al Pastor, Asada, and Carnitas. The Pastor was not your typical cut of pork off the spit. It was more like grilled after being sliced. The Carne Asada was your standard sliced seasoned beef. Was ok. The Carnitas were pretty good and not dry. All three had good flavor especially with the chopped up cilantro, onion, and radish. Also comes with a slice of lime and two different kinds of salsa. One is supposedly medium while the other is hot. To me both were good but both seemd to have the same spice level. I ended up mixing both up and which complemented the tacos well.  The second visit I wanted to get the Asada Fries ($8.00) but wanted it with Al Pastor instead. The nice lady said that was not a problem. If you refer to my pic, they have sour cream, pico de gallo, and cheddar cheese. It was really good.  Some random info. They take cash only. Since they are right next to a convenience mart, you can get more choices of drink from there. Make sure to take one of their flyers so that you know what the specials are for certain days.  All in all I thought what they serve here is pretty good. I just think that you should get just a little bit more meat for what you get.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #168"}
{"text":"Some of, if not the best Mexican food in the city. Even with most of the Mexican in Las Vegas originating from a can (hi Robertos), leaving the bar pretty low to begin with, this place shines! It could easily go up against some of the best that Cali has to offer. Great scratch-made mexi grub!! Do yourself a favor and make an order.."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, great service and pretty good prices. I wish they were open longer hours, but it's a nice treat to have them for dinner. My fav are the sopes with everything and add fresh avocado, my second favorite are the nachos with chicken or asada."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Very inexpensive.   I highly recommend this place!  I had 3 different tacos.  All were equally good!"}
{"text":"This place is good not great. Had the flautas and two tacos. The bf had a carne asada burrito. The flautas (3) are although good tasting extremely TINY. The tacos were okay my chorizo was cold and overly salted. The burrito was good but the portions this place gives is a JOKE...The tacos had no meat, Im serious there was a sliver of tongue smaller then a bic lighter, the burrito was the same I had 3 bites and never got any carne asada. Had three flautas, two tacos and left hungry. The only reason Id come back would be for the flautas they were delicious just made for a small child I guess."}
{"text":"Very fresh foods here. Cheap and better than some fancy Mexican restaurants. Fresh fresh Mexican foods here and tasty."}
{"text":"Awesome attitude and quick eats! Portions are quite large, we split a supreme burrito and it was more than enough for two. Had the carnitas (shredded pork) and it was delicious. They also told us you can call in your order in advance so it's ready to pick up when you get there! Great!"}
{"text":"Its not worth your time or money. I love Mexican food, but this wasn't it. The food was really bland, the meat had little to no flavor,  there's an upcharge for basic things like pico de gallo and for 8 tacos, she gave me 2 salsas. I asked for more and she acted like she didn't want to give it to me. The  I should've listened to the reviews, but i decided to give them a try anyway. Not sure why they seem so stingy, its weird.   If you're in that area starving, and nothing is open, go for it, so you wont die. Otherwise.. 'meh'  Oh well, i tried it. I'll go elsewhere next time!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican spot in Vegas......the food is so good!. I use to live right by there so I've tried everything.  Its all good especially the chicken and el pastor. The rice is perfect and beans are the whole kind that taste very clean and healthy. The lady is hella cool too"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the tacos de asada last time. Tonight I got Carne Asada fries! Yummy! The green salsa is really good.  The service is fast and friendly.  Toss a tip in the School fund jar.  The girl who took my order tonight  wants to be a lawyer so the jar is for her.   Don't forget it's cash only but worth having to hit the your banks ATM if you have to."}
{"text":"This place has the best lengua tacos in the land. For any other meat, Tacos El Gordo still takes the crown but the lengua here is flavorful, juicy, and on point. $2 each and I'd get 5. Comes with all the toppings and hot sauce. This is a food truck in a parking lot and there are no seats so order to-go or expect to eat in your car. Cash only."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The service is great but their chicken flautas are the best I have ever taste. Highly recommend their food."}
{"text":"Yeah!! THEY'RE BACK!!!!!! I just visited this place last night and I'm happy to see they came back. Food is still so delicious and fresh! Definitely my favorite place!"}
{"text":"Roadside surprise! What a great discovery- great choices for tacos chicken, steak, tongue , carne asada .... all were excellent! Served the authentic way with spicy green sauce and a lime. I'm certain this will be a mandatory stop every time we are in Vegas !"}
{"text":"Great taco place close to the Rio. Had the pastor burrito with the green salsa.  Well cooked and will visit next time in town. Nice to eat something other then hotel food."}
{"text":"I have seen this little food trailer on a number of occasions but I finally got the opportunity to try the food las weekend.   They are located on the corner of Flamingo and Lindell. They have a number of daily specials and even items I had never heard of before. Once I see something new I know that's what I'm ordering. I was craving al pastor so I tried the pambazo with al pastor. It's a bit like a torts but the bread is marinated and fried I think. My fella for the al pastor burrito. Both of our orders came out quickly and we were on our way home with a back full of inexpensive goodies.  Both items were great. Not the best al pastor I've ever had, a little on the dry side, but good. We both preferred the pambazo to the burrito, though. The salsas were super spicy and I loved that. I have my eye in al pastor fries and I'll definitely be back for Taco Tuesday some time really soon."}
