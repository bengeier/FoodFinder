{"text":"Ever since I was a wee lass I've been taken to Moe Pancer's  for the pastrami sammaches. I still remember the interior of the old location. My dad was a Toronto-born food lover, and he knew ALL the places to go! Whenever we were we driving along the 401,  we ALWAYS stopped in a Moe's!  As a wee lass I LOVED the dill pickles.  30 years later, Moe's still rocks! I always get the pastrami sammache platter! Piled high with your choice of fattiness meat, fries, slaw and of course extra DILLS!! I have yet to try something different from the menu.....when something is this perfect, it need not be changed!"}
{"text":"Pancer's is incredible. I love the pastrami but it tastes even better if you ask for extra \"speck\" which is just more ground black pepper making it more spicy. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Awesome corned beef! Family run for 50 years.... Fast & efficient service.... Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill since the ownership changed. The service is terrible and gets worse each time I go. This was my last time. The quality of the pastrami has also suffered.   After arriving at the restaurant we were not greeted, the not so friendly waitress placed the menus on our table without greeting us it asking if we wanted anything to drink. I tried to tell her that we already knew what we wanted to order twice but was ignored.   When she finally came back to take our order we ordered the pastrami and fries combo (lean). The restaurant was almost empty yet it took about 20 minutes for the food to arrive. The pastrami was was chewy and not what I would consider lean, the fries were good but then again I do prefer them overcooked. The best part of the meal was the pickle.   When the waitress brought us our bill she said absolutely nothing just placed the bill face down and walked away abruptly. Didn't bother asking how everything was (perhaps she already knew the answer).  Sadly this will be my last time going to Moe Pancers at least until it changes ownership again and they have staff and management that understand the importance of customer service.   One star for the fries and pickle."}
{"text":"Upsides: Matzah ball soup was pretty good. Had a corned beef sandwich which was exceptional.   Downsides: Coleslaw was awful - can't believe they serve that. The dressing has absolutely no taste. The server I had was attentive but looked miserable and seemed disinterested.   Better service and better coleslaw is needed. Sandwich was awesome."}
{"text":"Great smoked meat.  Absolutely best Matzah ball soup in Toronto."}
{"text":"been a long time supporter  new owners keeping up with the pancer tradition nice guy best deli in toronto"}
{"text":"It is really sad. I have enjoyed this restaurant for more than 50 years. My parents brought us here every Sunday and thus a tradition began. I witnessed three generations of the Pancer's family owning and operating this once fine deli. In the last few years the deli was sold to non-family members. At first the change seemed to be positive.. But wow what has happened?? The new owners are nasty people. Almost all the staff has changed. Some of the products such as the hot dogs have changed and are just no good. The prices keep going up while the quantity and quality keeps getting smaller and poorer. But the worse part is that this place is now a major health hazard. It is truly filthy. The floor is nasty, the main floor handicap washroom is out of order, the basement washrooms are disgusting, and there are spider webs as you go down the stairs to the washrooms that look like they have not been cleaned for years. Can it get worse, yes, the meat cutter takes your money, and then with out washing his hands and with out gloves handles each slice of your meat as he cuts it. The meat cutter wipes his hair and his face and then handles your food. The tradition is dead and so is this filthy restaurant..  If you care about your health go somewhere else.."}
{"text":"The corned beef and pastrami sandwiches are arguably the best in Toronto.  If I crave Schwartzs from Montreal, this is one of the best alternatives to making a 6 hour drive"}
{"text":"Pancer's can lay claim to one of the best corned beef sandwiches in the city. The meat seems to melt in your mouth, and the bread is always fresh. (I hate stale, crumbly bread!) The fries I thought were rather ordinary, and at close to $4 I don't think they are worth it. The service is usually pretty fast. If you are in the Bathurst and Wilson area and looking for a great corned beef, give this place a try."}
{"text":"An experience in the worst service / management of a restaurant so great it was more astonishing than frustrating.   First impression: Greeted with a grunt from a waitress sitting at a table as we walked in. Sign says \"Please wait to be seated\". So we wait and she stares at us for about 10 seconds. \"Sit over there\" and she points to another table.  The place is dirty, but in a charming-deli sort of way. I know they've got supposed great corned beef / smoked meat here, so I'm very interested in trying it. I see a special listed on a chalk board for haddock fish and chips, so we order that, too. Smoked meat sandwich, fish n' chips, and a latke.   While placing the order, we had to repeat ourselves a few times because the young waitress was very flustered. She had about four or five tables to herself, and didn't appear to be getting any help from the other 4 or 5 employees present (Mostly listening to iPods/washing dishes, or sitting). I could hear other tables getting ancy, and one got up and left because they had been waiting so long. So I strapped myself in.  Our sodas were forgotten and had to be asked for about 3 times. Same thing happened to the other tables. This girl was getting everything wrong, but she really didn't mean it so it was hard to be upset. They brought out the sandwich after about 15 or 20 minutes, but no appetizer (latke), and the fish n' chips about 15 minutes later. It wasn't busy, so it was perplexing that there was such a hard time getting food out to tables on time, as ordered, or at all.   One customer went up to the deli counter where the guy behind was cutting meat. \"May I have some mustard? There's none on the table\". \"You're gonna have to sit down and ask your waitress, it's going to take me just as long to get it for you\" \"....ummm... ok?\"  The sandwich was good, actually. I liked it a lot. Could have been spicier, I guess. And there was only French's Yellow Mustard. Fish and Chips...well, I should have known better. They were quite bad.  Latke...was...quite good! Maybe my favorite part of the meal. No, wait, my favorite part of the meal was imagining Gordon Ramsay walking in and yelling everyone for either sitting on their asses, not caring about customers, and generally the worst management of a restaurant imaginable.   $35 poorly spent."}
{"text":"A solid deli. Nothing over the top...just the good stuff  Nana used to make."}
{"text":"The best chicken fricasee in town. Better even than 50 years ago which is how long I've been going there.  And the deli sandwiches are classic and piled high.  I think they have re-opened."}
{"text":"I love coming here the food is fresh  I ordered turkey sandwich man it was good . They are known for the pastrami !! The food is perfect the prices are fair and everytime I eat here it always tastes homemade.. You can't go wrong here.."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I went here with a friend for lunch on the recommendation that the food was great. Food was ok, nothing to write home about, but the service I received was appalling. My friend ordered the corned beef, I ordered the smoked meat sandwich. The first word out of our server's mouth to me was, you must like bologna, because that's what this is, must love your nitrates too. Then when the server brings our drinks she asks me if I am from Montreal. I reply no, and she responds that I must just love chemicals then. At this point I'm ready to leave, but my friend really wanted to try the food. When our food finally arrives the server sets my friends plate down and states, the good lunch choice and sets my plate down and snarls, the meat that could stay in a fridge for a month. I don't care how bad you think the food is, when a customer orders from the restaurant you are supposed to be promoting, it is inappropriate to consistently harass them for the item they choose. Will never go back. Way better deli's in this city with better food and WAY better service. Cannot believe the reviews people have given this place. They must not have made the mistake of trying the smoked meat. Try Caplansky's. Their servers are happy to serve you anything from their menu."}
{"text":"Outstanding corned beef in an appropriately ratty old deli setting, complete with rough-around-the-edges waitresses - PERFECT!! LOVE the corned beef here, best I've found in the city, ask for \"fatty\" to get it extra moist and flavourful, request the hot mustard to really set it off, and even though the fries are frozen, they arrive red-hot, NOT over-salted, and are just yummy :) I can't speak to anything else on the menu, I always get corned beef and I always love it. The place is tacky, the servers brusque unless you charm them out of their boredom, and the corned beef is perfection.  Really big eaters like myself can order the corned beef \"platter\" that comes with four slices of rye and is basically a do-it-yourself two-sandwich plate ;) Trust me, just go! Cheers,  .James."}
{"text":"i was taken here today by my Jewish friend who lives in the neighbourhood and wanted me to experience  authentic Jewish deli. i lived in Montreal and knew this from Swartz's and The Main. i wanted chopped liver (which i love), however it could have been served with a few slices of tomatoes or some onions. plus the bread that they gave us with that order was the super small slices from the end of a loaf, so we HAD to order more. the liver was great although i needed to spice it up with salt and pepper. SO GOOD. we ordered a full fat half corned beef and half pastrami sandwich. it was superb and the rye bread was very soft and fresh. i wanted to order the meat that they prepare in house. even the pickles were the bestl. i had a cabbage soup which was delicious although a bit too sugary for my taste. it had big pieces or cabbage and juicy, tender meat. all in all, a super great experience. highly recommended. the place is an institution."}
{"text":"The sign in the counter says \"The Best Corned Beef Sandwich in Town\". I think that this may be a boast that actually has some meat (har har) to it. Consider this: the first time I ate their famous corned beef sandwich, I was ANGRY. I was angry at all the times I ever ate that shitty corned beef that comes from the grocery store and ENJOYED it. It was like I grew up watching only Sandra Bullock movies, and at 28 walked into a theatre and saw Inception. I was at once grateful, elated and frustrated. How was I not introduced to this sooner?  On my second visit, I dragged half of my family along with me. We started ordering a bunch of sandwiches when our server stopped us and instead ordered 2 platters of sandwiches for us, saving us a ton of money, I should add. Each platter comes with two kinds of meat, two sides, and a stack of bread. We had corned beef, pastrami, roast beef and beef tongue. First came a small plate of fries, some potato salad and two bowls of coleslaw. The fries were exactly the right amount, these days I can no longer eat the metric ton of fries that come with most meals. My grandma was a fan of the potato salad, and the coleslaw was fine. Who gets excited over coleslaw?   The standout favourite was still the corned beef. The pastrami was second. I really enjoyed the beef tongue, but the rest of the family wasn't too into it. The roast beef was kind of dry and tasteless compared to everything else. Five people easily shared 2 platters without feeling super stuffed. Honestly, I didn't enjoy the platters as much as I did the sandwich on its own, but maybe that's because I didn't want to hog all the food and only had two slivers of meat with each sandwich, whereas the sandwich they give you is stacked so high, you have to squish it down to eat it.  This place is amazing and is my new go-to place when I'm craving Schwartz's in Montreal."}
{"text":"the smoked meats are awesome, havent been there in  a while, prices are a tad expensive but the flavor and quality are out of this world...close to Montreal quality..."}
{"text":"I came here for my friends Bday dinner so we were a group of 6. We all of course ordered the smoke meat in a variety of dishes. I got the smoked meat sandwich and my husband got the pile of meat (not sure the dish name). This was the best smoke meat sandwich I have ever had!!!!! I've never had the Montreal smoked meat but my husband said it was very similar and comparable.   The decor is old and not as clean as I would want but the restaurant has been around for a long time... Service is not that great as it took a while to get the sandwiches. This might be due to the fact there's only one server for the whole floor and this is a Sunday. So they are very short staffed.   But since the smoke meat was so damn good I would def come again even if I have to wait! Lol"}
{"text":"Pancers has been around forever.   I really like their pastrami, although the corned beef is pretty good too.  They will hand cut if you want it for just a buck more.  For just over 11 bucks and tax you can get a great sandwich, a dill and some sides."}
{"text":"Sorry, Caplansky and Corned Beef House -- I gotta say, Pancer's has the both of you beat for Best Corned Beef in Toronto. Even though Pancer's is practically in BFE, it's worth the commute for their tasty, tasty meat. Even the coleslaw (which I generally hate) and the french fries are good. Best yet, the people that work there are awesome. Oh, believe me -- you'll get your food with a side of sass, and you're going to love every second of it."}
{"text":"The corn beef sandwiches here are outta this world. Piled sky high, that salty tender meat melts in your mouth and barely fits between two slices of rye and some mustard. It's just plain old fashioned delicatessen goodness!   I've been told this is one of the more famous deli's in T.O. and I can see why - they do things the old fashioned way and boys is it worth it. The fries are greasy but oh-so-yummy and the restaurant itself is filled with a zillion signed pictures, newspaper articles and random memorabilia that make this place full of character.   If you can get out here for a bite, you surely won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is a great place! Just went for a quick lunch and shared a platter of 2 meats: tongue and smoked meat. They were both excellent. The fries that accompanied the order were crispy, but a bit skimpy and not the absolute best. The coleslaw was terrific and not overly sweet.   When you examine the menu they list (cooperative advertising), their suppliers. This made me wonder what is really made on the premises. This is only a slight reservation, as the taste comes through well.  This is not fine dining but casual, cheerful and quick."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite and best deli sandwich in Toronto. All aspiring sandwiches and sandwich makers should run to Moe Pancer's with pencil and paper in hand and take detailed clear and concise notes because they have the deli experience down pat. The food the service the atmosphere are exactly what they should be to the classic Jewish deli experience."}
{"text":"The basement restroom area stinks like rotten milk and bleach but the Kishka is outstanding."}
{"text":"Pancers is not bad. But I cannot say it is as good as Caplansky's downtown. I have heard stories about this place from Toronto Jewish friends and I expected some type of Toronto deli wonderland à la Schwartz's in Montreal but Ontarianized. What I got was a let down.   I came here because I am a devout RUSH fan and this is where Geddy and Alex came to eat after their first paid gig in 1968. I eagerly told our server that and she could not have given less of a damn, simply saying \"yeah, they are on the wall\". But whatever, I want my meat. We sit down to order. Having driven here all the way from Montréal in my 1997 Volvo 850 GLT Wagon, I had to take a long tinkle, so I ask where the bathroom is. The manager/owner of the Restaurant directs me to a confusingly located doorway and when I try and go into ANOTHER door that is marked \"WASHROOM\" the owner/manager yells at me \"HEY NO HANGING OUT BY THE DOOR!\" In a very rude tone of voice, what a Jerk! I am coming from another province to drop $30 on your mediocre meat don't belittle me!    People say the service here is bad, our server was a bit gruff but I cant say the service was really bad, good enough to warrant leaving a decent tip.  Now on to the meat: the Smoked Meat was watery and chalky tasting, the type of industrial tasting smoked meat that in Montreal we look down upon, the type that is pre made in a factory than shipped to filthy fast food restaurants in bad neighborhoods. The Pastrami was odd tasting and had a corny taste not salty at all like real NY Pastrami should be. I had to add salt myself to make it edible. The Beef knish that I had as an appetizer however was pretty good.   The Restaurant itself is located on Bathurst so far north of civilization you need to drive there, the 7 Bus would take you literally a lifetime to get there but Moe Pancers doesn't seem like the type of place that south of 401 Hipster Toronto dwellers should be eating at anyway, so I'll add a star for that, since the food is certainly just average. Not bad, but average. The clientele is VERY old, I would say the average age in the place was probably around 92 and me and my friend brought down the average age by about 70 years!! That is alright though, I respect my elders, one day I will be one too and hopefully still eating smoked meats and knish's.   Moe Pancers is located in a run down strip mall that is easy to miss. It looks like it has not seen any changes since 1973, sometimes that can be a good thing but in the case of Moe Pancers it is kind of a turn off, the place looks down and out from the exterior. Maybe invest in some new signage at least.   I later read that the Pancer family sold the Deli to some randos but opened up another location in Vaughn. Had I know that I would have just gone there as I would rather give my money to them. My advice to Moe Pancers: go to Montreal. Eat at Schwartz's and Copy that. It'll do you some good. I guess silly Ontarian's will never really get it.  Overall, Moe Pancers is OK. I wouldn't go back but if you are in North York and you want a decent corned beef and to hang out with North York's surviving members of the Greatest Generation, check out Moe Pancers!"}
{"text":"Great food but incredibly rude service on a regular basis.  Not sure if they've discovered the concept of customer service as of yet. Worth a try though."}
{"text":"I have been here on several occasions and I say the corn beef sandwich here is very good. The service here is great, the waitress was very friendly and did a great job of making us feel welcomed. However, she is the only person working the floor so service is very slow.   There is a large selection of sandwiches here with different types of meats. I liked most of them with the exception of the roast beef which I though was dry.  I definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a good deli sandwich."}
{"text":"little known fact about pancers. BABY BEEF! i mean listen, you want corned beef meh go feeeeck ya self. go for the baby beef, unless your a pu**y and care about unfair animal practices.  Baby Beef, and kishka. DO IT  best deli in toronto still doesnt touch schwartzs of montreal"}
{"text":"MEAT! MEAT! MEAT!  Pastrami on Rye ($7.50) was so good!  Made in house! Soft, tender, juicy and  flavoured with the perfect spices!  Moe Pancer's has this old world charm without the hustle. I found the restaurant clean and the wait staff friendly!  I'll be back for more MEAT! Corn Beef anyone?!"}
{"text":"Will it sink, or will it float - the Matzo Ball soup conundrum.  Pancer's has been around since I have - which is well beyond the advent of 10 digit dialling and postal codes.   Lets talk broth first. One word: good. Not great. good. This place is known for its smoked meat, but I'm here to test the balls, (matzo). The soup is nothing to write home about. Its home made but its sort of weak.  The matzo balls are smallish in diameter. mid-weight. You know its there on the spoon, but it doesn't hurt the wrist. There's flavour there, somewhere. Perhaps a tad more salt?"}
