{"text":"New favourite spot! Chef Renaldo is top notch and the rest of the staff is very friendly and welcoming. The veal, done in a Barolo wine reduction, is to die for. AMAZING wine list too!!"}
{"text":"We were headed elsewhere for dinner and happened upon this lovely, little restaurant.  We checked out the menu and decided to stay instead of going with our original plan. So glad we did!! The ambiance, the food and the service was equally excellent. 
We will definitely be back - thank you for a wonderful evening!!"}
{"text":"Went to Anima Trattoria and Wine Bar for their grand opening. The experience was amazing! The atmosphere was very cozy and intimate. We started with the charcuterie board, which was amazing value... so many delicious meats and cheeses. The onion and bacon jams were fantastic. My wife had the branzino and I had the veal chop. Both were delicious. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for great Italian food in Etobicoke."}
{"text":"Mine and my husbands favorite spot! We have visited about 4 times since they opened a few months ago (just us and a large group). service is personable, atmosphere is intimate, wine is delicious, and FOOD IS INCREDIBLE. You can tell the chef has a passion for food and the servers care about your experience. Highly recommend for an intimate night with your partner, large group or family/friends night out. :)"}
