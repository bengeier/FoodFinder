{"text":"I have to admit, we love Laredos, but only order one thing...the nachos con mariscos.  They are so good we never order anything else.  The margaritas are good, but a little sweet for my taste.

The service is good and the bartenders are quite friendly."}
{"text":"Good place to go if you're in the mood for Mexican food. It's always my first choice. Good decent food; best in the area. Good service and even free chips and salsa which they refill at the start. Okay prices. Overall four stars."}
{"text":"If I want mexican, I go here.  It is perfect for lunch too, as the service is fast.  Free chips and salsa makes it even better.  It is not overly priced and with the weekday specials, almost cheap for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Nearly every time i'm in Madison to visit my sister and her family, at least one dinner is at or from Laredo's. And I always end up getting the same thing- the Beef Chimmichanga. 

I will admit that I'm not an expert on Mexican food, but i think this place does well if you're having a craving and as with all things, you always have to temper your expectations. It won't blow you away, but it'll be enough to satisfy that Mexican-itch in your tummy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! 
Service - everyone is so friendly and welcoming!
Food - tasty and comes in large portions. Nachos appetizers are great, in-house guacamole is the best i have ever tasted, several types to try.
Drinks - Delicious margaritas, lots of flavors to choose from, but the classic is awesome. 
Atmosphere - light music, beautiful art on the walls. A very casual and authentic place."}
{"text":"Food is very good! Ordered the chicken enchiladas poblanos, soo good with white cheese sauce and table side guacamole is fun and tasty too! Service is fast and clean environment! U won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"We've had really good experiences here. On the last trip, my \"enchiladas guadelajaras\" were excellent, topped with fresh lettuce/tomatoes and guacamole. Very fresh and delicious. My wife's \"enchilada poblano\" was similarly excellent. The mole sauce was rich. We enjoyed the Laredo margarita and a dessert flan. The only mild criticism is that the dining room (like most other restaurants) can get really loud. But we'll be back."}
{"text":"The service was fast, the food was good and it was cheap. I had hoped for a little different atmosphere - it's bright with booths - but all in all it was a great experience.  I plan on going back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Best mexican food in town. Service is very friendly and food comes fast.....almost too fast!"}
{"text":"Boring, bland and over priced for what it is. Originally we liked it but prices went up and food quality slightly down makes it not worth going."}
{"text":"Ok this is my favorite mexican restaurant in Madison and it's only because they have the best Queso!!! 

No one else can get it right it seems but that Queso is the best! 

I also like their quesadillas :p"}
{"text":"There really aren't  many places to eat in Madison as other reviews have stated. Being from NY it really did seem like a no mans land, so thankfully Yelp came to our rescue. We went to Laredo's and got carne asada, nachos with chicken, chimichanga's,and churros. It wasn't the greatest but it wasn't the worst thing in the world. We only got our food to take-out so I don't really know about there wait staff or the bar. We got our food pretty quickly and it was hot but not really well packaged. When we got back to the hotel some  of packages where leaking, it was annoying but didn't effect the taste. All the food was good and has something familiar about it. If your in Madison,WI and are looking for decent Mexican then try Laredo's."}
{"text":"Lunch and Dinner experiences... Super Fast service for lunch.
Atmosphere is nice, booths were comfy. Greeted right away in Spanish which was promising.
Friendly staff and busy place.

Huevos Rancheros with Chorizo is amazing!! Not greasy -seriously perfect! 

Chicken Enchilada with Mole Sauce: The chicken is very flavorful, cooked with onion and peppers and other spices was a nice change from normally bland chicken I've had at other places. The Mole they said was house-made, but I felt it was a bit underwhelming and very much like the kind you can buy in the store and doctor. Needed more intensity IMO. Large portions made good left overs.

The Sopa (aka Mexican Rice) was very flavorful and well done, moist but not sticky.

Chile Relleno: all I can say is the batter ruins it entirely. Disgusting. It tasted like it was cooked in old heavy grease and tasted like a soggy thick battered onion ring. The cheese stuffing and pepper would be very good if they could do a lighter batter and use clean grease to fry it and then maybe let it drain before continuing... Disappointed.

The menu certainly caters to American tastes as others have said. The salsa is very good the chips were OK. I've got to try the guac and a couple other items mentioned here."}
{"text":"I've been going to Laredos for about 13 years and have always been a fan. They have made some changes I don't love, but the chips and salsa and quick service usually make up for them. The meat is cooked authentic style(with potatoes) and generally very flavorful. There has been a time or two the meat has been too salty or burnt tasting but I would def. recommend Laredos to friends.


Edit - 9/30/12

Not too sure whats going on at the Whitney Laredo's but it's been kind of falling off.."}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions, waiter knowledgeable about ingredients. We'll enjoy this just as much as the takeaway as we did in the restaurant!"}
{"text":":::YUMMY:::

Great service! Loved our waiter, super polite and knew what he was talking about. 

The chips and salsa were tasty. Fresh chips and amazing salsa. Not spicy. 

We first ordered the special margaritas which were a strawberry and lime mixed. They tasted excellent and they had the right amount of booze in them. Loved it!!

 The waiter recommend My husband the sea food enchiladas. He really liked them. Said the shrimp tasted fresh and would definitely get them again. 

I got the Chicken Fajitas, el de casa. 
Loved it! Before you even see your food you can hear the fresh veggies and chicken  roasting on the skillet coming out of the kitchen! Everything tasted fresh.
I also got the corn tortillas with it. I think they were homemade! Mmmm!

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Only been here a few times,  the food can be hit or miss.  Atmosphere is much more relaxed than pedros. Lots of choices and combos. I really likes the quesadilla, almost like a texmex grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"Good, cheap, fast, friendly. Best fresh chips and salsa."}
{"text":"By Madison standards, not that bad. But not all that great if you've ever lived in any large city (LA, Chicago, San Fran) where there are tons of little storefront mom and pop Mexican places and even food trucks that do better than Laredo's on a regular basis. The fajitas are probably the best thing here."}
{"text":"Yet another restaurant I wish I had visited earlier but didn't because of the 3.5 star rating, which was lower than many of the other Mexican options in the area. For the purposes of this review, not coming here sooner was probably a good thing because I have the opportunity to try all of those higher rated places and this place in comparison comes out on top with a solid 5 stars. 

While this was only my first time here, I came here with a party of 10 and not one of us was not satisfied with our meals, so I would reconsider some of the poor ratings on here before writing this place off. 

Not only was the food inexpensive, but the portions were HUGE. In addition, the service was extremely quick. I drink a ton of water at dinners and I did not find myself empty once between their four refills. They even start you off with free nachos and salsa, which they refill before you are even finished if you would like more. Finally, on more of an aside but still related, I also liked that they give you boxes to package leftovers yourself rather than bring it to the back to do it for you, since I've read that that process can be unsanitary at times. Again, just a super nitpicky detail that I personally appreciated."}
{"text":"Good drink specials, food was pretty good, service staff was very attentive. Only negative thing is that the menu's were super dirty-it was so disgusting I sanatized my hands before digging into the chips."}
{"text":"The tacos are always delicious, but I fear venturing of onto other items as they may not satisfy my hunger for good food. I've had enchiladas, burritos and chimichangas here, but they are nothing too good. I only come here when I have a craving for steak tacos, besides then I usually go elsewhere."}
{"text":"So I stopped in at Laredos and ordered a Table side Guacamole de Casa and salsa and chips to go. $17.95? I was in a rush and didn't think about it. Just signed the tab and left. Looked at the prices online afterward. RIPPED OFF"}
{"text":"I agree with everyone else... ridiculously fast service.  Cheap.  The most amazing salsa and freshly made tortilla chips ever (you can get both to go!).  My only complaint is that sometimes when I order tacos they don't bother to ask soft or hard shell, and just give you whatever.  Then I have to awkwardly send it back to get it fixed."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and was happy to find a good Mexican restaurant in a hole in the wall of a strip mall. The colorful wall murals are fun, and the food is good and comes in large servings, almost too large."}
{"text":"We live in the area and I never thought to come here before now even though I often crave Mexican food.

The place definitely satisfied my cravings.

First of all, the house guacamole is to die for. It comes in a huge stone bowl and the avocados are perfectly ripe and seasoned just right.

I ordered the enchiladas with mole sauce, and it was richly flavorful. The spanish rice that accompanied the dish was so good that I finished it first and wanted more, I usually don't feel this way about rice.

I also thought the service was great, it's a friendly place."}
{"text":"Massive menu made choosing my Mexican meal mighty difficult! 

The four of us opted for appetizers of table-side guacamole, yum, made to order with our options of tomatoes, garlic, jalopenos, cilantro, and onions. We also ordered some cheesy fundido thing that was also yummy. 

The meals were sort of superfluous at that point, so we all took leftovers home. Maybe not the best Mexican I've had, but certainly tasty enough. 

$70 covered the two appetizers, four entrees, at least a couple sodas, and tip. 

Service was pretty on-point, but the tables were way too small to handle that much food. :)"}
{"text":"I think Laredo's has the best Mexican food in Madison. I really like their salsa and guacamole. They have great cheese enchiladas too. Their margaritas are really tasty too:-) I recommend going to eat here."}
{"text":"I am a long time customer of both Laredo's and Mi Cocina (Cocina Real) in Middleton (they have the same owners). I went out for dinner last night at the Hilldale branch and had a very bad experience. I was dismayed because it was so atypical to what I usually experience when I visit Laredos.

The Good:
The host, Jesus, was pleasant and friendly! He did an excellent job of seating us and bringing us our chips and salsa. He provided great service and had an awesome attitude. Unfortunately, this is where the good part of my visit ends. 

The Bad:
Our server, in stark contrast to Jesus, was quite disappointing. First of all, he screwed up my drink order, bringing me a blended Margarita instead of one on the rocks as I had ordered. When I politely sent my drink back, he had a bad attitude about it. The replacement Margarita that he gave me tasted as though it had no alcohol in in. I would not be surprised if this was his way of \"getting back at me\". This alone really wasn't all that big of a deal and I wouldn't be writing except for what happened next. My dining partner ordered a steak taco salad. He was brought a taco salad with scallops. We told our waiter about the mistake and asked for a steak taco salad. He the proceeded to ARGUE  with us and said that we did order scallops. My companion is actually allergic to seafood, and I can assure you he did not order scallops. The correct salad was eventually brought to us after about 30 minutes, but not after our waiter basically abandoned our table. He stopped refilling our waters, and he never brought us the refill of chips and salsa we requested. And Lord knows what they did to the taco salad. I actually can't believe my companion was brave enough to eat it. We did not leave a tip. Unfortunately, I did not catch the waiter's name, but I wrote an explanation on our receipt as to why there was no tip given. For the record, I generally give 15-20% for average service, and 25% for excellent service. I was just so irked that this waiter ruined our dinner that I couldn't reward him. Finally, the food wasn't up to par. I feel like they've cheapened the quality of their food of late. I might as well have gone to Taco Bell. 

I am not sure that I will return to any Laredo's establishment for quite a long time, if at all."}
{"text":"Put this inside of you. Great vegetarian options. Prices are reasonable and the food is good."}
{"text":"Laredos has a very extensive menu everyone can enjoy. They have all the typical entrees we have come to expect, but also a few less common and delicious spins on the classics with a variety of authentic flavors. 
What's also great is the extremely reasonable prices.
The decor has that fun cheese factor and quick, friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place used to be 5* but really is not quite as good as what it was.  The service used to be the best of any place in the city, and is just average now.  But the food is still good.  Tastes fresh.  Prices are fair.  Portions are good.  Not the gem it once was, but still the best mexican place in Madison."}
{"text":"Deceptive $ charging, horrible carry out, and an even worse \"manager\" and staff. 

Let me start by saying I've never, ever complained at a restaurant in my whole life, nor have I ever \"asked to talk to a manager\". I am so not that kind of person.

I order 2 ($11-12) meals for carryout and 2 sides of nacho cheese. Total is 30 bucks, leave a $5 tip. They give my bf 1 meal and 2 cheeses, so he goes back in to very nicely say hey guys I'm missing a meal. They tell him that we only ordered one meal and 2 cheeses and they tell him the rest of the cost beyond the 12 dollar meal is from the cheese and that it is $11 for the 2 small things of cheese. So he comes home and I go drive there and ask to get the second meal or have them explain why I paid 35 bucks for the one meal. I wasn't even being mean or anything.

They blatantly laugh about my pretty basic question of why I paid 35 dollars and go on saying the cheese is $11. I always get this as a side and I know this is total bs. Its seriously a little plastic cup of cheese lol. So I asked for a manager which I probably never wouldn't have done if the workers weren't acting like total jerks and I kind of felt like they were scamming people out of money on their cards or something fishy. 

Then I met the manager and that cocky idiot was just as bad if not worse as the horrible employees. After them all treating me like complete crap and suddenly acting like they don't speak any english, I finally said okay you will lose a customer over this? He laughed and shrugged and told me he didn't care. It's people like this who run businesses in the ground. 


Moral of my experiences:

-never ever order carryout 
-check your receipt if you actually get one or pay with cash if you go there since the prices magically change and they will do nothing once your card has been swipe
-hope you have no issues since the staff don't care 

As for the food it really could be better the meat has been questionable and freshness is hit or miss. And I guess don't get a side of nacho cheese unless you're a  baller. Rant over"}
{"text":"You always know what you're going to get. Very consistent each time I go. They have good chicken enchiladas. Food can take some time so you may not want to visit if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"Okay Mexican food,  a little pricy for Americanized Mexican dishes of canned beans and rice. 

The staff is always eagerly friendly and they've handled large take-out orders for our office staff lunch pretty handily with much incident. 

They make pretty strong and good margaritas and we do like the thick tortilla chips. 

I would skip the tableside guacamole where they roll out a cart of guac ingredients and make it in front of you for $14, unless you know you'd be just paying for the entertainment factor."}
{"text":"As with most places regarding Mexican in Madison it goes from meh to waaaaahhhh!!!! Laredos has halfway decent margaritas but it is a mostly darkly lit, dingy place with spotty service. The food isn't very flavorful the chips are bland and the salsa often tastes like tomato paste mixed with water. Don't get me started on the chimichangas what part of deep fried do they not understand? Seriously. I don't want to waste anymore time talking about this place. It looks like it hasn't had a dust rag run through it since the battle of the Alamo. Don't get me started on a dump like Pedro's I'd rather eat out of an outhouse bowl so I'm not even going to bother with a review."}
{"text":"I don't understand how people think this place is good. The food has no flavor. NONE. I understand Madison is far away from the border but come on, it feels like sham to me. If you are going to advertise as Mexican food then at least put some real dishes on the menu. 
Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I am from chicagoland where we Mexican restaurants every 5 feet.  This place is one of the best.  Any place where you eat refried beans like pudding is saying something.  Not to mention awesome salsa, solid dishes; all with great flavor!"}
{"text":"We have gone to Laredo's many times over the years. On our trip there last Wednesday night my son ordered the Rio Bravo. He was sick with food poisoning later that night and into the next day."}
{"text":"It's not the best or most authentic, but I love it.  The service is great and combo #1 is a home run."}
{"text":"Cute little hole in the wall place, AUTHENTIC GREAT TASTING Mexican food, excellent prices, friendly staff, very clean and well kept place, food comes out FAST and tastes FRESH, excellent home made chips and salsa and guacamole, good beer and good drinks. We have gone back two weeks in a row. Can not recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"I used to love the Laredos on Whitney Way, but having been to this University location I was super dissapointed. The food came out within 3 minutes of us ordering, I consider that a bad thing as the place was slow and I wondering how long the food had been sittin ghteir. It was flavorless and non appetizing. We didn't finish the meals, but they were reasonably priced. We probably will not go back again, it was just not that good."}
{"text":"Would probably give a 3.5 if that was an option. Very Wisconsin Tex mex - huge portions, not super related to Mexican food, very cheese centric. Good if that's what you're looking for though!"}
{"text":"The food is always good here and the margaritas as well. Usually the service is outstanding but today it is a little lacking. I guess it really is true that service usually is better when they're busier. There's hardly anyone here just myself and one other table but yet the server that I have seems really nonchalant I guess for lack of a better word. When he brought my chips and salsa he just threw it on the table, did not place in front of me or in the middle of the table but at the edge of the table on the other side of the booth. I'm here alone so there was not anyone else on the other side across from me. When my margarita finally came and that took longer than usual as well,the server who brought it was different and she also did not place the margarita in front of me, she placed it on the other side of the table as well-- near the edge which I thought was so strange. So I don't plan to tip very well today and I'm just hoping that if Laredos was reading this they'll make sure that all of their servers professional courteous service at all times. And there's even less of an excuse for this when they are really slow."}
{"text":"Like many other reviewers I love this place too. I've been eating here for years and am satisfied every time. The services is superb. My only knock is the prices have risen pretty steeply over the years. It's gone from amazing because of the price, service and food to still a great restaurant but maybe not the same deal as before."}
{"text":"Been to Laredo's a few times before and it was never my first choice. Now that l am a yelper I thought I would give it another look. Came on a Wednesday night and they had a large margarita special, it was good and was not light on the pour, all Mexican help and that enhanced the atmosphere! We were well taken care of! I had the Steak Rodeo,while not the best cut of meat it was huge and tasted very good. I'm a pretty good eater and could not finish it . The service was fast and friendly and I could not find any real fault's with this Establishment. Next time it could be first on my list, a nice and happy place!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and very fast and courteous wait staff.  I always get the chicken burrito made to order with queso on top,  its huge and super delicious."}
{"text":"Never been upset with Loredo's.  Resturant is always clean and service is always good.  I prefer their new location in Fitchburg."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's go-to get together spots whenever we need to decide on where to go to dinner for a group gathering.

If you are going with a larger group, make sure to get there early (especially if you are planning to go during a dinner rush), as they do not accept reservations.  You can have even just a couple people arrive early and they will start holding a table for you.

My boyfriend is ridiculously obsessed with their rice (it is REALLY good)....  He even usually orders one or two orders of it to-go after the meal, as well.  He also swears by the Mexicali Quesadilla with beef and orders it every time.  I have tried it and it is delicious.  I think the being smothered in queso has something to do with it.

My personal favorite is their Cancun (shrimp) tacos!  They are so flavorful....  Enough food to satisfy you but light enough that you don't feel overly full and sluggish afterwards.  If you order the chimichanga, be warned that it actually comes with TWO, which is pretty awesome because then you have a meal for later (if you don't eat them both in one sitting, of course).  

And you must try their chips (I mean, you're probably going to try them anyway because they bring them to your table and they also come with to-go orders).  They are so fresh, light, and crispy.  

The service is friendly but can be slow at times, but it's not enough of an issue for me to take away a star.  I mean, the food is just too good and makes up for it.

Two big YUMs up for Laredo's!"}
{"text":"Laredo's is a simple little Mexican restaurant hidden away in a sad little strip mall. I admit I was hesitant upon walking in, but my brother picked it so I wasn't going to complain. I'm glad I didn't either because I was actually pretty impressed. 

The prices were really reasonable and the menu had plenty of variety to choose from. I had tacos, my bro had an enchilada, and my mother a taco salad. Everyone enjoyed their meals and they came out quick.

I certainly would not hesitate to eat at Laredo's again."}
{"text":"Ugh. Where to begin.

I drove up to Madison to visit my boyfriend on Cinco De Mayo, and decided we should get some mexican and margaritas to be festive! So we chose Laredo's.
Bad call.
Service was bad from the minute we walked in. Hostesses were unfriendly, and since they were on a 15 minute wait, they ripped off a piece of notebook paper, wrote the number \"30\" on it, and told us they'd call our number.

We decided we'd grab some drinks at the bar while we waited. When the bartender finally made his way over to us, we ordered a beer and a margarita, to which he responded \"Uhh, that's gonna be 8 something... maybe.\" So my boyfriend just handed him a $10 and told him to keep it. Really? Shouldn't he know how much to charge?

When we finally got seated, we decided on nachos for an appetizer. They came out in one big pile of squishy mush. The meat was decent, but everything else tasted bland, and well.. mushy.

We ordered our entrees, and waited. And waited. And watched other people order and eat. And waited..... and waited... for 45 minutes, we waited. We actually considered just leaving (which I have never done and couldn't ever actually do). Finally our server came to our table and asked if we had gotten our food yet. We said no, he went to the kitchen, came back and told us they had boxed it up to go but that he would  bring it out now.
Yuck! I don't want food that's been sitting around in boxes for 45 minutes when I go out to eat. So my boyfriend told him we didn't want our food anymore and we'd just pay for the appetizer and leave.

At least we were too full of mushy nachos to really be hungry for the rest of our food.

In short, don't go to Laredo's."}
{"text":"Really good chips and salsa. You get huge portions. Food is seasoned well, no WOW factor but it's really good food. The staff is super friendly and fast"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. It has always been an average visit. However, today may have been the one that changed our minds...

ORDER THE ENCHILADAS MONTEREY.

Trust me on this. Two enchiladas: one cheese, one chicken. It is then flooded in molé sauce, and accompanied with refried black beans. $8.79 and you're welcome.

Both my wife and I were completely impressed and we're ordering this dish again."}
{"text":"Situated on the side of a major commuter highway is this nondescript little brick building that would appear to house nothing but just another greasy Tex-Mex restaurant shelling out food just a cut above Taco Bell for quintuple the price.

And when you walk in that seems to be confirmed...pink walls, tile floors, mariachi music...everything about it will remind you of your typical suburban \"Mexican\" restaurant experience, so I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the food went far above and beyond my expectations. I thought I came in knowing exactly what I was getting myself into.

Instead for around $20 (and this includes tip+tax) I was presented with a very high-quality lunch of fajitas and salad for two that I am more accustomed to expecting from a place that markets itself as upscale. The seasoning was excellent, the meat was juicy and high-quality, the salad was fresh and unique."}
{"text":"This is your fairly typical gringo Mexican place. I say this as someone who is very much a gringo. 

To talk about what was good, I sort of have to cover where there's room for improvement first. It'll make more sense that way.

* The first cup I received for my drink had a huge crack all the way down the side of it that leaked Coca-Cola all over the table. I really don't know how they missed this one, but it was about one firm grasp from giving a guest an unexpected shower. 

* The men's room could use some attention. It didn't look like it was dirty, so much as that it needed a bit of maintenance. I have a couple of pictures I plan to upload, but I'm not sure they do the scene justice. The sealant attaching the urinals to the walls has begun to peel and the porcelain itself is discolored. There is a sheet of mirrored stainless steel that has, over the years, become tarnished and hazy by age and presumably some less-than-gentle washings. Covering most of that mirror was a half filled-out world cup bracket (at this point the tournament has been over for more than a month) declaring Mexico the winner (nope). My fiancée reported a similar condition in the women's room.

* The service was...Abrupt? Curt? Brusque? You know what I'm trying to say. It's not that  either the hostess, the guy who brought chips, or the server were rude--they weren't--but neither were they particularly hospitable. Requests, questions, etc were--whenever possible--met simply with emotionless, quick, monosyllabic affirmations.

* The food came out disconcertingly quick. I recognize that this is a weird thing to bring up as a negative, but understand that the time from placing our order to the food arriving was probably less than 10 minutes. Being quick is great, but even Applebee's isn't that quick and they just microwave things. In fairness to the restaurant, Mexican food lends itself well to being put in a pot and kept heated, then served out as necesarry and I'm sure that is what happened. Their menu states that their food is made fresh daily, but I've frozen burrito filling I've made at home and gotten the same exact texture as what I was served here so I would question that bit.

The positive, and there is some:

* For a quick burrito that I suspect was frozen that morning, it was actually pretty good. The flavors were all well blended and the result was something I was happy to eat. I ordered a burrito that was covered in a delicious cheesy, creamy sauce (the Rio something, I don't remember). That cheese has just the right texture and flavor to complement the burrito and I can't recommend it highly enough. It might be a bit heavy if you're not into cheese though. 

* The fresh salsa brought to the table had good flavor. It wasn't as hot as I'd like for myself, but when I'm with my better half I'm used to compromising on hotness, so it was okay (even though I'm coming down with a cold and I was hoping to find a food that would clear out my sinuses!).

* The prices were outstanding. I would have expected to pay 1.5x the price of what they charge for any of their dishes at most restaurants. With certain lunch specials you can eat for a little over $5, more if you get a drink. That's just wonderful.

Ultimately, I'd recommend this place to friends and family who I know aren't ready for a \"real\" Mexican experience. It is what it is, and the food is tasty enough. 3/5."}
{"text":"Ever since Laredo's first came to Madison it has been one of my favorite Mexican places. Not only because of the good food but the good prices and service. 

I hate to say Laredo's has fallen victim to trying to cut back food quality and service to save a buck. But, at the same time, raising their prices. It started about a year ago when they started adding chunks of potatoes to their meat to try and stretch it to go further. Now, they have slipped some other unknown filler into the meat along with the potatoes to stretch it further. 

Last night I went with my wife and stepson for dinner.  All three of our entrees were cold.  I ordered the enchiladas sonora.  The rice was a solid mass and was simply scooped from a much larger preparation...probably a corner of a large kitchen pan based on it's shape/density.  The refried beans were ice cold.  The chicken enchiladas were simply thrown together... cold with precooked chicken.  It was gross.  I have worked previously in the service industry and I honestly do not know how this disaster of a meal could have left the kitchen.   

I'm sad to say the Laredo's I grew to love no longer exists and I can ever go back. Good luck if you go there."}
{"text":"I have yet to be disappointed by Laredo's!  My wife and I went a week or so ago for a date night.  I got the Cinco De Mayo dish with their famous cheese sauce instead of the red/green sauce.  Yummy!  I always love eating here and then regret how full my tummy is :)"}
{"text":"First off let me say great vibe! Good authentic music and decor, they made the best of a small place. The food however, could use a little work. Not saying it's bad or makes you sick, certain dishes can be rather bland or mushed together. Let me explain more:

Service - Vert good, waitstaff is attentive and service is quick. I work just across the parking lot and having my lunch there takes 30 minutes easy.
10/10

Food / Drink Quality - First with the good, the drinks. They are well made and reasonably priced. The food however is hit or miss. My first time there I ordered the chimichanga. I had a hankering for deep fried burritos, problem was the presentaion was very sloppy and the lettuce/ sauce drenched the chimi so there was no crunch left. Ive learned to ask for specifics as to save the deep fried goodness. The beans seem watered down and runny and the beef is mixed with potatoes, hiding any kind of spice. Their authentic dishes are decent but there isn't much variety outside of tex-mex. The beef tips are well seasoned however.
6.5/10

Price - Although the food needs a little work, the prices and portions are decent. The lunch specials are great for a cheap and hot meal, just avoid the potato beef. Get chicken or steak, its worth the extra 75 cents.
8/10

Experience - The vibe is great, love the decor and waitstaff. Very good. Seemes a little cramped in the booth section.
9/10

Overall 33.5/40 - I like Laredos but I like at least 5 other places in Madison more, much better than Taco Bell, just under Cancun."}
{"text":"I've been to this location (Whitney Way) many times between 2012-2016. I like their food because of the great, affordable options as well as taste/flavor! The staff is polite & gets the food out in a timely manner. I'd recommend the place."}
{"text":"Really good carnitas burrito!! 

This beaner gives it 5 stars for taste, service. And authenticity.  Will defiantly come back."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow, I hate waiting for my drink refills and didn't get plates for my chips and queso 
But the entrees were really good, ate too much, but that's what we boys do.
Rio Bravo burritos, Enchiladas Nortenas, and Burrito Mexicali all good."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I was a little bit surprised in that the food was actually pretty good.  I'm not sure why I was expecting otherwise.  I guess because from the outside it just looks like your standard cookie cutter Mexican restaurant.  Hell maybe it is.

I had a veggie fajita that came out, as it should, sizzling on a cast iron skillet.  The veggies were well prepared and flavorful, as were the beans and rice that came with them.

The only complaint I have is with the horchata I drank.  It tasted OK, but it was too rich.  Like they ran low on rice milk and supplemented with cow milk or something.  It also left a slight film in my mouth which is a quick way to get me to dislike anything."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the lunch menu, but I found it bland and unsatisfying.  I wish I had found a Chipolte instead.  On the plus side, it was quick."}
{"text":"One star because we didn't even eat here! Walked in around 9:00 and we asked when they closed because we didn't want to keep them if they closed at 9:30 or something and the guy said 20 minutes so we decided to leave when they really don't close till 10 on this specific day! Seemed like he just didn't want to bother serving us. Not sure what the issue was."}
{"text":"\"Holy cow that was fast!\"

That's the typical response of someone who got their dinner here.

They don't mess around.  Even for a group of 4 if you wait 15 minutes for your food, something is seriously wrong.  In the meantime, enjoy some chips and salsa.

As for the food?  It's okay.  It's not anything stellar, but you won't leave disappointed.  It's a good Mexican offering.    

But it's the service that makes this place.  They're fast, they're good, and it's an overall decent establishment."}
{"text":"First things first, this place is a joke. The hostess didn't even wait for us to seat us. Our waiter was too busy washing dishes to even fix our orders. The verde sauce was warmed... so warm it was steaming. I'm sorry, but who eats warm verde sauce on their tacos? Not this chica!! Can we discuss the fact that I had to ask for cilantro and onions for my tacos AND they did not have lime and then offered me a lemon . I will not put lemon on my steak taco. How do you run out of limes at a Mexican restaurant.... is that not one of the primary Ingredients to eating Mexican? No one thought to run to a grocery store and buy a few limes? We are just going to not have limes for our customers? Okay good idea. But I will say my steak and shrimp quesadilla was amazing even with the chicken that came inside it (that which I did not order). But what I will do is give them 12 stars for the margaritas, they were perfect. All jokes aside, I would NEVER dine here again but I would definitely stop in for a drink."}
{"text":"This is an old stand-by. If I could give 3.5 stars, I'd do that, but it's not quite a 4 in my book. They are solid, consistent, and have friendly service. 

I think the food is good, and there is a lot of it. Tostadas are consistently soggy on the combination plates, which frustrates me a bit, and when guacamole comes as part of a dish, I find the portion to be too small. 

I do appreciate the chips and salsa (although there's never enough salsa and I'm constantly asking for more) without a ridiculous uncharge found at other Mexican restaurants.

I will continue to visit occasionally because it's a quick and uncomplicated in-and-out for lunch at reasonable prices. 

The best thing, though, is taking leftovers home and turning into a scramble or frittata the following morning. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Laredo's is a great place to go when you are really craving tex-mex Mexican food. I have changed my order up every time I have gone and have never been unhappy. I would say my favorite is the fajitas. It may not be the most authentic Mexican food but it does the job."}
{"text":"I've always been happy with Laredo's... super fast service, good consistent food, decent salsa all at a good price."}
{"text":"Laredo's is always wonderful. All of the staff and servers are polite, friendly and FAST. We love ordering the guacamole and margaritas!"}
{"text":"This is the only Laredo's location we've dined at. The food was bland, Mexican food should have a boom, zest, bom chicka wow wow. This place had none of that. Sorry I will stick with Pasquals across the road!

Food 1 Star
Service 2 Stars
Location 2 Stars

{"text":"Great queso, great portion sizes. Great if you're hungry and ready to eat a lot of Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever! Best food ever period. I compare all other Mexican restaurants to Laredo's, it can't be beat! The restaurant is filled with fun pictures painted on the wall, the staff is always friendly, and the food is amazing. 

They bring endless, hot, free chips and salsa. 
I would recommend the chimichanga colorada, fajitas, tacos, and chili relleno."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever! Best food ever period. I compare all other Mexican restaurants to Laredo's, it can't be beat! Best chips. Best salsa. Great service. Have never ordered anything that wasn't delicious. The chimichanga colorada is incredible."}
{"text":"Love Laredos. Lots of options ranging from vegetarian to steak. Great chips and salsa. Friendly servers. Love their top shelf tequila. Very smooth and wonderfully priced."}
{"text":"Holy yuck. I have been to Laredos in the past. Not bad for the American version of Mexican food. In fact they have this one unique dish called Pollo Yucatan that is actually pretty good. I've tried to mimic the creamy salsa verde sauce. But even that fell short tonight. 

I didn't want a heavy plate so I ordered the enchilada and taco combo platter with beef. DON'T DO IT. I can't believe you can get a worse dish than that. The ground beef was the driest ground beef I have ever had. And the sauce was bland. The best thing on the plate were the refried beans. Those weren't too bad but I pretty much spent $11 for $0.49 of beans.

The staff seems bored and irritated to be there. That is never a good sign.

I might try this place one more time when I'm in the mood, but c'mon....if you are competing with American styled Mexican against Pedro's who is blocks away....you are going to lose."}
{"text":"I've never been too fond of Laredo's. A coworker talked me into going for lunch though. 

I do like the lunch specials. Only $6 for a decent size lunch and it comes out very fast! The food does tend to be on the more plain side of the flavor scale. For what you pay I guess you can't complain too much. 

The service was good and as I mentioned earlier they were very quick to bring us our lunch."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant.  My wife and I have been to this establishment a number of times and it is always good.  Last night was no exception.  

Chips and salsa arrive to our table shortly after we are seated, followed by an attentive waiter that took our drink order.  On a couple of occasions, we have taken advantage of the 2-for-1 house margaritas, but opted for fountain Coke products for this visit.  My wife always gets the combination plate No. 2 where I typically attempt trying something new.  On this particular visit, I went for an old standby that was on special: the seafood burrito.  The best way I can describe my burrito is that it is always consistently good, yet frequently inconsistent.  
I have had the seafood burrito on a number of occasions and it's always delicious.  The seafood is never overdone and never fishy but there is always a little difference in the execution.  On this most recent occasion, I was given the option to have beans and rice on the side as opposed to inside the burrito, but I don't think I have ever had the burrito with rice and beans.  It was also stuffed with a decent amount of spicy yet almost fruity jalapenos which I have never noticed before.  I have also ordered the same burrito and it has come to the table smothered with queso.  
Please don't mistake that I am complaining.  The food is great.  My wife always gets the combination plate No. 2 because the beef is always tender and flavorful as well as the chicken.  We have never had a bad meal at this location.  Burritos, tacos, the chimichanga verde, the fajitas jalisco; they are all great.
You don't walk into the place expecting 5-star gourmet but it tastes delicious and it is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Very good mexican food.   Authentic in taste and atmosphere.  The Fajita Guadalajara is our favorite.  We share it and there's plenty for both of us."}
{"text":"A decent enough mexican tex mex place if you absolutely refuse to try to get something worthwhile. It's better than Pedro's but I occasionally miss the free fresh tortillas you'd get there. As the previous reviewer said, thoroughly average.

If you want Mexican but actually want to eat good food instead of filling the empty cavity under your diaphragm, go to Taqueria Gudelajara. You'll save money too."}
{"text":"Their food is very good, but I was not impressed with the service. I asked for water when I first sat down; had to ask three different waiters over the course of 30 minutes before I actually got a glass of water brought to my table, though. Our waiter was very inattentive, even though it was a slow time of day and there were very few patrons in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent menu range, very flavorful meals, free chips and salsa appetizers, gigantic portions, and prices in the $10-15 range typical of a Mexican restaurant combine to make Laredo's the best Mexican place I've yet tried in Madison.  My only complaints are the flavor of their lime margaritas (which is sub-par) and the lack of kick in their salsa (but I love very hot foods)."}
{"text":"I'm not so sure why this place gets voted best of Madison all the time.  I think people have a hard time distinguishing between something that's great, and something that they've just heard about.

Laredo's is totally average.  The service is good, the food is just okay.  End of story."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Nice chips, good burrito. Haven't found any Wonderful mexican in Madison so far, but this is not bad."}
{"text":"Me gusta!!! I love Mexican food and while visiting Madison this past week we actually came here twice in 10 days. The queso dip was delicious as well as our entrees. The price for the food is cheap (we were only here for lunch menu). And they came out in really good time! 

The only complaint I have is the prices for margaritas - $10 and it didn't taste like a drop of tequila was in it :( other than that we will definitely be coming back, without ordering the margaritas."}
{"text":"This is another great dining establishment in Madison.  I was here for a quick dinner with friends before a Badger's hockey game recently.  The menu was big, and the prices were reasonable.

I had combo with a chicken burrito and taco.  They were cooked well, and very flavorful.

One of the great things was how quickly everything came out.  The service was fast and friendly.  Will definitely stop back and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Was so unbelievably delicious! Super fast service and friendly. Best enchilada and Mexican rice!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously fast?  Yeah, particularly the 'ridiculous' part.  I've never been rushed through any meal quite like the last time I went to Laredo's.  I think me and my dining companion were seated and back out the door in under a half hour.  That's practically fast food-caliber fast.  When my food is that fast, I don't really enjoy myself.  I feel like I'm in a race to see who can cram the most Mexican food in their stomach first.  I think maybe if I were going there for lunch on my work hour, I'd appreciate the fastness more.

That said, the food is always delicious and reasonably priced.  I particularly enjoy their different flavors of margaritas.  Also, they have good lunch specials."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible food. This is not Mexican food in any shape form or fashion. Even the rice isn't authentic. The tamale was edible, but not fantastic. The burrito I got was disgusting, bland, and slapped together. The enchilada my husband ordered was basically the same as my burrito but with a corn tortilla instead of flour. And the taco was more disgusting than taco bell. 

I can't believe this passes for Mexican food and I can't believe this has four stars.

We will never ever go here again. 

The salsa and chips were decent and the service was quick (although not good service; he didn't say a SINGLE thing or offer to do anything about it when I told him that my burrito was gross)."}
{"text":"Close to 2 star because they need to step it up here.   This is another of the overrated Madison restaurants and another one of the \"Best of Madison\" restaurants that is just plain mediocre.  Don't get me wrong, I have had some good hot meals here but they have a lot of work to do to get me past 3 stars.  The bathrooms are not the cleanest and seem neglected.  The food is of good flavor and hot but not especially memorable.   I did have one of the best margaritas here once.  The staff is a little remote and unfriendly and they are a little crowded.  Just ok and not somewhere I would recommend for Mexican food.  Pedros is better and they aren't spectacular either."}
{"text":"We were visiting, and thought we would give this place a try.  The atmosphere was cute with the murals and such, the booth was comfortable and the service was friendly.  The chips and salsa were decent - always nice when the former are served warm as it really brings out the corn flavor.  Only one margarita was ordered, and although it packed a punch, and you could definitely taste the tequila, it wasn't very memorable.

After our table of four ordered, we continued to snack on those darn addicting chips.  When our meals finally arrived, I was not impressed.  I had ordered a combo of one tostada, one tamale, and one chile relleno.  You know the kitchen doesn't have much concern about the taste or execution of a dish, when all three components are swimming together, with no delineation.  My tostada was limp as it soaked up the sauce from somewhere else.  It was just a mumbo jumbo of ingredients meant to fill someone's stomach without regard for taste or finesse.  Most of the time it was difficult to know what part of my entree I was eating as it all melded together.   I can understand how the younger generation may love this place, as you get a lot of food for the money, but I am way past experiencing belly bombs.

I know that some restaurant owners feel they have to cater to some Americanized version of their traditional food.  I guess I'm just not their target market."}
{"text":"Okay so as I was eating it I was loving it. So tasty...but then about an hour later I was sick. I won't give you the gory details, but I definitely won't be going there again."}
{"text":"Laredo's has been an old favorite for many years.  We've been countless times, and the service is always good, and food excellent.  The bottom line is that you can't beat the good food for the price.  Sure, you'll find better Mexican places in other parts of the country, but this quite possibly could be the best Mexican food in town."}
{"text":"This is where you go to get wrecked............ by cheese.  If you like cheese A LOT, you can order any of their delicious combos smothered in ooey, gooey, creamy, warm cheese.  

Is there actually any real food underneath the gigantic blobs of cheese?  Strap on a portable oxygen tank and dive in to find out!

In the 1988 film \"The Blob,\" an evil life form goes around eating people, only at Laredo's you can finally get yer revenge and eat the blob...............if you dare!  

*blurp *blurp*"}
{"text":"I really like Laredo's.  This location is nice but not fancy.  I usually only get 1 thing there and thats the Burrito La Roqueta.  It is amazing.  There are some days that are better than others but overall, it's pretty much a winner for me.  I also really enjoy the Queso dip and the tortilla chips.  I request their spicy sauce and dip my chip in both the Queso dip and spicy salsa.  It's a fantastic combination!"}
{"text":"Best service in town, maybe in the world.  This newly blossoming empire around town also serves up the ultimate hangover cure, especially when complimented by a Propel.  Store that fact away, it's a useful one."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I have visited this restaurant several times and have always left happy. The chips and salsa are perfect! Fresh warm chips that aren't too flimsy, yet perfectly crisp. Table side guacamole was the best I've had, and done just the way you want it.  We have tried many of the entrees and they are always great. Fajitas have nice size pieces of steak, chicken and big shrimp. Texana quesadilla was absolutely delicious! Waitstaff is always very attentive and food comes out timely and hot. When I'm on the East side of Madison and want good Mexican food, I definitely head to Laredo's."}
{"text":"Great service. The waiters are always at the table, food is fast, chips and salsa are good."}
{"text":"Sooo good! Fantastic cheese! Great salsa. But the cheese...... SOOOOOOOO DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I went just the other day and they are still rocking out great Mexican American food. The service is fast and friendly. This is not authentic Mexican it's what I grew up on and it's very good. They have great chicken tacos, great quesadillas. Double plus good!!!"}
{"text":"stopped by for lunch on a Sunday.  I forgot how much I enjoy the kick ass margarita's at this place.  The simple standard marg, blended with salt is awesome.

Beyond that I orderd the Chimichanga Verde.  It was a spinach tortilla filled with a wonderful mix of pork, peppers and onions.  The green \"verde\" sauce was flavorful.  It could have used a little more \"kick\" for my palate yet all aound a great meal.

Once again the only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is service.  It wasn't super busy yet the waiter seemed to disappear near the end of my meal and I waited forever to get the check."}
{"text":"Used to be a fabulously affordable restaurant with good food, too (and a nice vegetarian plate selection). Then in they suddenly printed new, fancy menus (minus the vegetarian listing), jacked up the prices, and decorated the place up a little more. After that the food didn't taste as good and the service became lackluster -perhaps forgiveable if not for the price increases. Our little group of Laredo's fans was heartbroken."}
{"text":"I've been to Laredo's three times now, and it just doesn't do it for me. The food is fine, but nothing to write home about. 

+ pretty cheap
+ lots of combo platters so you can easily mix it up
- chips/salsa not that good
- food is only average

Tonight I ordered the chimichangas. Instead of one big one, you get two smaller ones. Since you get two and your choice of chicken or beef, I asked for one of each. 

They brought my platter, and after I took a bite of beans I noticed our waitress hovering over me with another platter. She explained that \"this one\" had one of each, and that she was going to take the one they gave me and \"just throw it away.\" 

A waste, because it wasn't really that big of a deal if they'd brought me two of the same; there was no price difference and I wasn't dead set on having one of each. 

As it turns out, I think they had originally given me what I asked for and took it away, because my replacement plate was two chicken chimis*. Food trashed for no reason, and potentially the correct order (or they plated it incorrectly, twice). 

*Their idea of chimichangas are really just bigger-than-average flautas; they were open-ended and have no filling aside from the meat. They also offer flautas, I wonder if they're just the same thing.

Other blips in service:
- served everyone but one person at the table, and took forever to finally bring them their food (soup)
- we had three kids with our group, and their parents explained they were going to split a meal between the three of them; the waitress didn't bring any extra plates, so we made \"plates\" out of napkins

So, yeah. The food there is fine, but the atmosphere (dark) and service (lacking) make it pretty low on my list of Mexican places in Madison."}
{"text":"Before coming here, we didn't think it was possible to have BAD Mexican food. (Heck, we'll even take Taco Bell.) The meat here was cold and the flavor was awful. Don't come here unless you're a big fan of Chef Boyardee."}
{"text":"Definitely some of the fastest served food in the area. I always enjoy their fajitas, queso and margaritas. While not the most exceptional mexican food I've ever had, its always consistently good. One of the things I think they could improve on, is specifically with their chicken in the fajitas. I almost feel as though the meat wasn't cooked fresh on the spot, but earlier in the day for quick service. While thats great for turnaround and getting food out, it leaves the chicken feeling dry and not as fresh as it could be. If they are looking to push their quality they could really look into a different way of preparing their foods. Overall though I really like coming here and will continue to."}
{"text":"I would like to start out my review by saying Laredo's used to be one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town. However, my last two visits have left a lot to be desired. Like other reviewers have noted it seems that they have cut back on their food quality to save money. My family and I visited recently and ordered the following: 3 tacos, regular nachos, enchiladas meal, and two kids meals (quesadillas). The meat in all the dishes had chunks of potatoes (at first I thought they were large onions) which I thought was very odd. The kid's quesadillas were just a small tortilla with shredded cheese folded in half and pressed. Our bill came to $40.00 and I felt like at best we had about $8.00 worth of food out of a Sysco can and heated up. Service is good. Food not so good."}
{"text":"A pitcher of margaritas for $25.. yes please. Just dont try to finish this off by yourself.. bring your friends. 

If you are looking for a quaint little sit down Mexican food place. Youve hit the spot. Its easily accessed with lots of parking out front, prices are decent, and the wait staff is pretty good. Chips and salsa are free, the food is served quickly, and the guac does cost extra."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good and the food was prepared quickly. The first time we went there we were less than impressed but decided to give it another try. Food was better this time, but nothing spectacular. Our bill was about 25 with the tip for two people, so it's relatively inexpensive."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican food, ridiculously fast service, and their margaritas are basically tequila slushees.  They have a solid daily specials board and their menu is packed with a lot of interesting ingredient combinations that provide you with more options than just your typical choice of chicken or beef."}
{"text":"Every time were here it's great!! They are quite willing to make any dish vegetarian - not just rice and beans. If you ask they will sub in potato, spinach and more cheese. The servers are always friendly and accommodating with our wee one. Careful of the margaritas... They're strong ;)"}
{"text":"Great salsa and chips.  Free.
Chimichanga, enchilada, tacos...  All delicious.
This place is our Go-To in Madison for great Mexican food.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone that is looking for great food, fair pricing, and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you are trying to meet a movie theater time or make it to your kids' soccer game, then this might be the place to stop. If you prefer a casual, lingering meal, then this is not your choice.  It feels like they want you to fed, watered and out within 30-40 minutes.

As I was looking over the menu, I ask for guacamole as an appetizer.  I was really looking forward to a nice chunky dip.  My drink came.  A short wait later, a tiny dish of green mush was put before me along with my meal.

What is this?  Did they squeeze it out of a tube?  It did not resemble guacamole at all, except for what I have seen pre-packaged in the grocery store. So disappointing. My entree was the poblano mole enchiladas. Meh.  Just okay, around average.

The waiter checked on me once through the entire meal and that was to bring a leftovers box and my check - which upon seeing my total was (in my opinion) overpriced for what I received.

At the end of the meal, you are not even out of your chair before someone is clearing the table and wiping it down for the next in the cattle chute line."}
{"text":"Not feeling it.

While there's something to be said for a restaurant that can turn a lunch table in less than 30 minutes, the sheer mediocrity of the food has me hesitant to return.  If you have a need for speed, this place is so fast even ol' Jimmy John would freak.  My server dropped off a my complimentary basket of chips and salsa before my rear end hit the seat of my booth and within five minutes of my arrival, my server took my order and delivered my food.

While not freshly made, Laredo's takes the time to warm each basket of chips.  In addition, the consistency of the salsa allowed me get a healthy dose with each chip. .And better yet, another basket of chips magically appeared each time my previous serving ran low.

I ordered the half chimichanga off the lunch menu for $6.49.  When I opted for the beef, I had visions of deeply seared, marinated steak, like many of the taquerias in the area (Los Gemelos, Habanero's, Guadalajara, Sabor Queretano).  The beef in my chimi was grainy, dry, ground beef - massive fail.  Also disappointing was that the exterior fried tortilla had absolutely no crunch, probably the result of the mountain of moist guacamole and sour cream heaped on top of the smallish half chimi.   The dish as a whole was under seasoned, I wish my table had a bottle of hot sauce so I could kick up the heat of my food. I would have requested some had my server checked back after he delivered my food.

With so many more worthy local options for Mexican food (see above), I'll probably avoid Laredo's."}
{"text":"They have really improved since my last not so glowing review. The food is delicious and quick. The waiters are very friendly, helpful, and greet with a smile always. The tortilla soup can be made without the chicken which is awesome for me! It was so yummy. And the music and environment is nice. My daughters and I love going there!"}
{"text":"I've since been back several times and had much better experiences. The food is still pretty bland and not spectacular, but it's a really easy place to take my son for lunch. The staff is friendly and the service is always very fast. It's a good, casual place, but I would prefer having a Pedro's on the west side."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Been here twice and I probably won't come back again- there's gotta be some better Mexican places.
First time I ordered a taco salad and it was all meat with like two little shreds of lettuce. I had to ask for a bowl of lettuce to make it somewhat of a salad lol.
Second time, chicken enchiladas and it was dry as hell. If I ever have to go there again I'm just going to drink haha"}
{"text":"Ole? 

Oh no. 

I can safely say I tried it, right? They have an extensive menu, reasonably priced lunch specials, and decent salsa, but that's about it. Guacamole that came with my chicken fajitas looked like someone had driven over it with a Mack truck and it didn't taste much better. Chicken was grisly and lacked flavor and the peppers were so over cooked they melted in my mouth. Not in that good melt-in-your-mouth sort of way. In my quest to find the best of the Mex in the Midwest, Laredo's didn't have it. 

Got a rec? 

Let me know."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat Mexican in Madison!! Really good fajitas , enchiladas, and margaritas!"}
{"text":"I really had a good time here overall.  Our pitcher of top shelf (we upgraded),  blended, original flavor margaritas were really smooth and delicious!  For what the margaritas cost individually,  definitely look into getting a pitcher if you know you're having more than one margarita during your visit.  It's a large pitcher that goes a long way.  For food, the chips and salsa were fine-pretty typical for a restaurant like this.  I also sampled the mini-chimi's appetizer that I thought was fine, but there was corn inside them, which my husband wasn't liking. For my main dish,  I went with the tamales, and I thought they were really delicious and authentic tasting.  When it comes to service, our waiter was very nice and gave great service, but he talked really, really, fast.  If you're looking for a Mexican restaurant where you will get lots of food for the money along with great top-shelf margaritas, this place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Laredo's is a nice place to get some tasty Mexican food.  Lunch service is quick, allowing me to get in and out without taking too much time.  Many good options on the menu - haven't had anything I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"Really bland food, lousy service. tasted like there was MSG in the food, and the portions were WAY too big. Overpriced, too. Will not be returning. If you want good Mexican, try El Pastor on South Park."}
{"text":"It's cheap Mexican food.
It's hard to really mess up Mexican.

Nothing was particularly bad or good about my visit here. The fish tacos were entirely \"meh\" as was the guacamole.
I wouldn't say no if I was in town again and my friend wanted to come here again. But I have to believe that there are much better Mexican places on Mad-Town."}
{"text":"We used to be regulars here when it opened - at least once a week, maybe more. The food was great, the service unbelievably good. Consequently, the line was out the door and you ALWAYS had to wait. Now... it's in the same space, but nothing else is the same. The food is sub-par (last time I was here I got food poisoning) and the service atrocious. 

They offer chips and salsa at the table when you come in. You used to get one dish of hot and one dish of mild. Now, you get two of medium to hot with none of the fresh veggies and cilantro that used to be a large portion of the salsa of yore. While they have Pico de gallo, if you ask for mild salsa they bring you the red sauce they use on burritos. When I got my hard shell taco order there was so much beef - not what I was expecting. It might have been great - had the beef been seasoned at all and not tasted like fish.

I should probably only give it one star, but I have so much affection for the Laredos of the past that I can't quite make myself do it. We hardly ever come here and only came now because my 11 yo chose it. Now even she's remembering why we haven't been back. I will never be back if I can avoid it. Yuck."}
{"text":"I've been going to Laredos ever since I moved to Madison, I call it my favorite restaurant in Madison, pretty big statement huh?  However, I am contemplating this now, I absolutely LOVE the service, maybe cause most of them know my name because I have been their countless times, But lately the prices have gone up and the last time I think I ordered the enchiladas and they were just average, I suggest going for dinner and ordering the steak jalisco, it's usally delicious and they are usually consistent with the food.  I'll have to try it soon to be sure but definitely go to the West Side on Whitney Way, the East Side Laredos is just NOT THE SAME!"}
{"text":"Not really a whole lot of flavor going on.. I liked the beans and sausage/pulled pork cup of whatever it was. The chips and cheese sauce was good, but the overall flavor in our main dishes was lacking. Not sure what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are frequents at Mexican restaurants and this one tops our list. Very quick service and delicious food. The freshly made guac is TO DIE FOR, as well as the chips and salsa; and the servers are not shy about keeping them coming! I definitely recommend the chicken tacos or the chicken chimichanga (my personal favorites), otherwise my boyfriend always gets the fajitas. Very reasonably priced and love the ambiance. Though the restaurant seems small and tightly packed, I've always felt like we've had privacy at our own table. 

Just an overall great place."}
{"text":"Mediocre Mexican food. Enjoyed the chips and salsa. Thumbs up for our friendly, attentive waiter. Another thumbs up for my tasty mango sangria."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Every time we are in Madison we make a special trip to Laredo's ... worth it every time.  Great service, great food, great margaritas.  I've been dining at this place for nearly ten years now and it has never disappointed."}
{"text":"I remember eating here once and saying, \"What's the point?\"  It's a big heavy, plate of food, but nothing jumps out at you as a highlight.

This time, I got the point.  The point is that sometimes you want a solid meal.  You want to fill up on something solid.  You want to stoke the flame in the belly with something hearty, something warming, something filling, something sometimes gloppy - - with lots of creamy, hefty comfort in the gentle, pleasant flavors.  it's TexiMexiComfort food.

If there were a baseball analogy (which every proper review should include), it's like there are no flavor blasts to the left and right field fences.  Instead it's an inning of seeing-eye ground balls and Texas League singles that still manage to load the bases, and drive in a couple of runs. 

Don't go if you are craving the apex of novel tastiness to cap off your week;  don't go to impress a date;  don't go if you are feeling slightly peckish and want a rare, refined, sublime accent in your culinary landscape.

Go if you want dat belly full of hefty, creamy, mondo-goodness.  I really liked the chile relleno - - it had that vegetal musty twist true to the pepper, and it really stood out amidst the sea of sauce and the ocean of food that is combo #7 with the beef enchilada that also asserted itself OK alongside the bay of beans and the craggy hillside of rice.

The salsa, was excellent, actually, too.   The service is efficient jaded professional.

It's four hours later as I'm writing this, and I'm still stuffed.   Sometimes you just need some TexiMexiComfort food."}
{"text":"Fast service and kid friendliness are two hallmarks of all Laredo's locations, and this is no exception. I am not a big fan of their chips and salsa, but it's no extra charge, so who cares? They always serve my friends' kids with deference and make everyone feel welcome. The food itself is nothing groundbreaking, but it is mostly reasonably priced with fairly large portions.

My favorites are the Rio Bravo burrito (big burrito filled with tender beef tips, Mexican rice, refried beans, topped with queso Blanco - which is excellent) and the burritos de la roqueta (mentions pork on the menu but you can get chicken - very good). After some chips and salsa, I always come away stuffed and can take half my Rio Bravo home. Grab a Blow Pop on the way out!"}
{"text":"I know this not your super traditional place for Mexican food but it's kinda been a staple for me and my family for many, many years. The staff is always super friendly and they still remember me even though we mostly do take out now on account of our son's allergies. They have other locations but this one is the best in my opinion.

My favorite is the enchiladas senoras (sp?). Its chicken with spinach, poblano peppers with a creamy Verde sauce. I also get a side of mole sauce to use on the enchiladas as well, its really tasty. My husband enjoys the burrito de las roquetas. I've tried it and it's really good. Filled with carnitas among other things topped with verde sauce, cheese and fresh salsa. I also like the steak jalisco with mushrooms and onions and the chicken a la parilla. Both are lighter options, not covered in sauces or cheese. Their rice is also pretty good. Pick up and dine in are usually super fast too."}
{"text":"Always great service and good food at reasonable price. One of favorite places to go. Consistently a great experience."}
{"text":"Not bad, big portions, most entrees are sharable if you're not a big eater. But yeah, if you're starving for some good mexican food and eat big, this place will fill you up to the brim."}
{"text":"Basic Mexican fare.  Service is good.  Food is inexpensive.  I am a regular.

See more info in my review of Pedro's."}
{"text":"Great spot to take the kids. I would give 3 stars for the food and 5 stars for the service. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive. The food was good. The portions were pretty large but not overwhelming. The kids quesadilla was awesome according to my son--Crispy and gooey. The veggie combo was very good, and the parilla (chicken) was tasty. My only complaint is that I would have liked a better proportion of tomatoes and onions in the salad/veggies (it was almost all shredded lettuce with just a few diced tomato bits). 

I'm not sure why it isn't busier, but we're definitely going back."}
{"text":"This is a great place for couples and families.  The prices were very reasonable, the food was delicious (and tasted authentic), and the setting was aesthetically pleasing.  The staff was exceptional, as was the services.  Our server always made us feel welcome and did a great job suggestive selling.

The drinks could have been a little stronger, but you can never go wrong with beer, which they had a great selection of.  I recommend for either a night out for dinner or lunch date with a pal."}
{"text":"Possibly some of the best Mexican food in town.  I know for Madison that's not saying much but they have a great menu and great staff.  Check out the enchiladas."}
{"text":"I just wanted some steak tacos with no onions. My first plate arrived, onions obviously present in the tacos. Second plate: tortilla, steak, nothing else in the tacos. Asked for some cheese and lettuce...they brought it out...but acted like I was being unreasonable. Pretty sure I'm not the only person who doesn't want onions in my tacos. Not going back ever. It's too bad because the service was usually great."}
{"text":"I didn't think the meal was spectacular but it was fast. I love the salsa and chips they put out and the at atmosphere is casual/enjoyable. I think in the evening, it sounds like a fun place but we came for lunch."}
