{"text":"A nice addition to the area. Their meat is what really sells the place. Pork carnitas are very tasty and not overly oily. The sopes are great, as are the tortas (even if they are built upon regular sub sandwich bread). They toast all their stuff so it's nice and warm. A lot of food for the price! All I want to see is an horchata machine and I'll be a happy dude."}
{"text":"I could not believe how horrible this place was. I had a \"Mexican style\" -- or so this place claims-- barbecue beef sub.  I got it to go. I had to drive 10 minutes away.  When I finally ate the sub, it was soggy, literally soggy.  The guy who made it toasted it for about 30 seconds. I was thinking that wasn't long enough to get it hot. I was right. The whole thing was not only soggy but lukewarm.  There was nothing \"Mexican style\" about the sub. It was a barbecue beef sub with some ingredients that you might find in Mexican food. On top of all this, a sub and a soda cost me $11. This place just opened, and I am so incredibly disappointed. I don't know how you can open a new place and turn out such a horrible product within the first few weeks of being open."}
{"text":"So excited to have this place in our neighborhood, but really disappointing! The tacos have no flavor, the tortillas taste like from frozen product. They have the food open to the air and the guy serving me couldn't stop talking.... three tacos for $5.75 lunch special \"combo\" its cost me almost $9.00 because the combo doesn't include drink. This place is horrible mexican place to eat.  Carm F."}
{"text":"I've had two excellent subs there now, and my wife had an excellent burrito bowl. The previous comment that warns about the soggy sub is a good point. I'd say eat it there when it's made fresh (the tables inside are good), or at least don't travel much past the neighborhood before enjoying....and you will then enjoy a very tasty sandwich."}
{"text":"Since the last time I went there Mr. Torta's has expanded and clarified its menu a great deal thanks to a bit of renovating at the counter. Now there are visual presentations and written descriptions of basically every ingredient and dish scenario, and I believe they've added a couple new dishes entirely (sopes might be new at least, if my memory is right).  The quality of the ingredients is standout in my opinion. I don't know how they make the food so cheap because they're clearly not cutting corners with the materials. The ingredients are better than what you'd find at Chipotle or Qdoba, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Carnitas were wonderful. First time there and they actually offered samples in little cups of the different meats. I narrowed it down between two of the Carnitas but can't wait to go back and get the other."}
{"text":"We've gotten food from here a few times now and it's always been really good! We've done takeout and delivery.  My husband loves their burritos  (they're huge!) and I like their taco salads and bowls. My favorite meat so far is barbacoa beef as it has a little kick to it. They have a lot of toppings, salsas, and sauces (nacho cheese, chipotle ranch, sour cream, etc). I like to switch it up each time and get a different combo of sauces.  We haven't tried their tortas yet which I think is their specialty so we'll definitely go back.   The staff is really friendly too. Overall a nice little lunch spot!"}
{"text":"So excited to have this place in the neighborhood!  I have been here three times and I have loved it each time!  The guy working there is very friendly!  The nachos are my fav and I like having so many choices of toppings.  There are three different types of beans, several choices of meat and a few different kinds of shredded cheese. The tacos are great, too (I liked the chicken more than the steak) and they give you a choice of sauces that include jalapeno ranch and jalapeno cheddar.  The subs are huge and you can really pile them high!  You definitely get your moneys worth!   Some people here seem surprised and disappointed that their sub became soggy after 10 minutes...well, you know...spreading beans on bread and topping it with saucy meat is going to do that.  I wouldn't plan on traveling too far with your sub before you eat."}
{"text":"Ordered online: Good take out Mexican--especially the chicken tacos, and quesadillas. Very nice, friendly service as well."}
{"text":"Carnitas sub with all the fixings was delicious. Can't get a sandwich like this anywhere else in madison. Owner was incredibly nice, letting me sample every meat lol. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place. I ordered takeout online which was convenient. The employees were friendly, and it was really clean inside. However..when I got home, the chicken tacos I ordered were so soggy that they had pretty much disintegrated. For the price I paid, it wasn't worth it at all.  I'm pretty sure eating in would solve this problem, but for my taco fix I'd rather run to Cuco's or Tienda Los Gemelos."}
{"text":"We ate at Mr. Torta's a week after the restaurant opened.  We chose the tacos and burrito.  The portion sizes were extremely generous to the point you couldn't pick the burrito up without everything falling out.  The chicken tacos were okay but nothing to rave home about.  If you want a soft corn tortilla taco shell, you won't find it here, as they only offer flour tortillas.  The food was lacking in flavor and was probably the most mediocre Mexican food I have ever tasted.  I am still hunting for a more authentic Mexican restaurant in the Madison area, and Mr. Torta's definitely did not fit the bill."}
{"text":"Likes: Their burritos are big and they do good food.  Dislikes: Their prices are high (that may explain why I don't see a lot of people here, a fast nickel is better than a slow dime), and they don't have certain items at dinner.  Good enough for the neighborhood but not something you'd pay a whole lot for."}
{"text":"Sort of like a Qdoba with a local neighborhood feel. The staff builds your own burrito and the guacamole wasn't even an up charge though it's not the best guac I've had either. We opted for the 2 tacos (soft shell) because the burritos were HUGE and more than we could ever eat in one sitting.   A very tasty menu with the standard Mexican options. Good for either eat-in or carry out. We'll definitely be back next time we want some easy Mexican."}
{"text":"This place warms my soul. You can tell the person that runs it is dedicated to his food and his customers. He is always there serving customers with a smile. I ordered a couple of tacos and he started scooping meat but his cook brought out some new meat to refill the pot. He then started the order over again so I could get the fresh meat that just came out.  Toppings are do not cost extra here! Anything you want you can get. There are many flavorful varieties of topping. Not the generic beans and rice and pico de gallo. I got some pickled onions with habanero peppers (spicy!) and some corn salsa, as well as chipotle sauce on my tacos.    Unfortunately the construction is blocking this place a bit but it is open, and there is  plenty of parking you just have to turn right or left off of cottage grove road and there is an entrance easily accessible.   I really hope this business will thrive, everyone should come on over to Mr.Torta's and have some great Mexican food!"}
{"text":"3.5 but they should be able to work out the kinks easily in the near future. I have been here quite a few times because it is good, they have a ton of veggies, it is pretty convenient,  and usually quick. They offer lunch and daily specials and it is basically a Mom and Pop Chipotle-like operation. You choose you meats, cheeses, rice, veggies, salsas, etc. and if you want it in a bowl, taco, \"sub,\" or burrito vehicle.   They can be slow at times and run out of things due to not being fully prepared. While I was having lunch one day I saw the line moving very slowly and a customer left frustrated when she learned they were out of white rice and it was minutes before noon. These practices should be reevaluated for their long term success.   It is good place for a quick lunch overall and I have never had a bad experience. If you are into spiciness get the habanero onions and habanero salas and you will be pleased. They staff are genuinely nice and seem to be doing a lot to keep the place running."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The ingredients are fresh and their pickled onions are spot on - just enough spicy zest. However, I have to wonder for a place that calls itself Mr. Torta's why it does not specialize in tortas? The sandwich that is served here is more like a large sub. There is no Milanesa or other meats/breads/anything traditionally associated with a torta. The meat is generally shredded and not stove-top cooked just warmed.   They do offer (currently) a Monday/Wednesday burrito deal for $5.99. With this you get your choice of beans, rice, meat (chicken or beef - they sometimes have pork instead) and 3 toppings of choice. An additional large helping of any salsa/topping is only 60 cents.   The ingredients are fresh and you get a HUGE meal for the price. I'll be here again to try some of their other options for certain."}
{"text":"Back after a few months. Enjoyed my taco much more than before. Good stuff.  Solid torta, burrito, and taco shop in the we build it for you vein. Completely renovated space that was formerly Papa Bear's. Very nice space with a happy vibe."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new restaurant on Cottage Grove Road. The shop is small and located in a strip mall. Cottage Grove Road is under construction so it's difficult to get to Mr. Torta, but parking is easy and abundant.  Mr. Torta has a good menu selection with a variety of meats and ways to serve it. I ordered there sub, aka the Torta, and it was delicious. They offer many toppings including Pico de  gallo, habanero peppers with onions, and guacamole at no extra cost! Load up your food! The steak fajitas were juicy and tender and perfect. The price is just about right.  This restaurant is a great experience and the best food you'll find on Cottage Grove Road. Visit!"}
{"text":"We attend church just up Acewood Blvd. at Four Lakes church of Christ and have been wanting to come afterwards for lunch. I am so pleased we came by today. The man who greeted us had a wonderful smile and truly seemed happy to serve his customers.  He even will let you sample the meats, veggies or sauces before he puts it on your order. My husband had a pork burrito. It was HUGE and I had the 2 tacos piled high with fresh veggies and he didn't skimp on meat. I had barbacoa beef on one and fajita beef on the other. Everything was AMAZING!!!! So good, flavorful and fresh. The place is also clean as is the bathroom. We will definitely come back!!!! Might be a Sunday regular for us. Thanks Mr. Torta!!!"}
