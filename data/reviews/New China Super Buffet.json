{"text":"Sorry...went there once and had a hair in my food....they 10% discount. I will not go back, so sad."}
{"text":"I gave this place 2 stars only because the food is good for the most part. BUT, it is never hot or even lukewarm which makes me scared to eat it. The owner is super rude. Never greets you, just acts angry at you for coming. He acts like we are trying to rip him off. Because of him and the dangerously cool food, I won't be back. Also, just can't give money to a rude owner, he shouldn't be in business"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go here, as buffets concern me (food temps, cleanliness) but my husband insisted.   He should have listened to me!  We tried to find somewhat healthy options, but it was impossible. ..no cooked veggie dishes, no tofu, and everything was deep fried except the poached salmon which wasn't bad.  Bottom line, if you are someone going to a buffet for quantity, not quality, you may like it.  As for us, back to local wonderful Thai food!"}
{"text":"I just went yesterday and there's a lot to like.  My friend and I were both impressed with the quality of food.  For instance, they have a broccoli cheese dish, and you can tell by the flavor that there is real cheddar and butter in there.  They have ice cream instead of soft serve and the chocolate was on a par with Blue Bell, if not better.  On our second visit (the next day) we ended up with dinner prices, but we got crab that was reasonably large and very tasty.  There were also racks of ribs, Asian style.  On the down side, my friend noticed later that a $3.00 tip was added to her bill (which she had charged) without her knowledge.  So be sure to write out ---0--- in the tip area of your charge slip.  We had also left a two dollar tip in cash.  The service is adequate, but you might have to ask for a drink refill.  Still, for $7.89 I got an excellent lunch.  Dinner was somewhere around $13."}
{"text":"Just had a great buffet at this place! Despite some of the one star reviews, we decided to give this place a try since the place we usually go to closed. No disappointments here. Lots of choices, food is prepared in smaller batches, so it doesnt sit for long, (especially the green beans). We went in around 7 and the place was pretty empty, but by the time we left it was pretty busy. Staff was attentive and courteous, everything was clean, including the rest rooms. Buffet was just under $13. I suppose there are lower priced places, but the food was good (had three plates of different stuff + desert) so I think it was worth it and will make this my go to Chinese Buffet!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place was pretty disappointing! At 7pm the food all seemed dried out and like it had been sitting there for hours! When they did bring out fresh it was only maybe two spoonfuls of the item. So my fried and I could never both try the fresh serving unless we rushed when we saw the lady carrying out the tray which didn't work well with other customers wanting to try the fresh serving as well!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever  Disgusting food , everything was cold and salad seemed as if it was from yesterday just the worst . Not only that but they even charged me for my 11 month old eating no Chinese restaurant has ever done that it's just the worst of place . Never will I come back DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BAD PLACE !"}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin. Came in right at 9:30 when they opened. 25 minutes later, I'm still waiting for them to put the food out! I would have left already but my kid is bugging me to stay. Then the server brought over napkins to our table with another person's lipstick on it. That grossed me out! Finally they put out dome food. I left at 10:45 and they didn't even have the Sushi out yet. NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN!!!!!!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for! $9.99 for weekday dinner is not bad given the amount of selections they have! There was seafood (salmon, shrimp, crab, mussels, and various fish), sushi (many types of rolls to choose from), and the other Chinese/Asian selections. Also, I feel like you shouldn't really expect to get much customer/diner service from a buffet since buffets are self-serve anyways. I get that the staffs don't really greet or say bye but honestly that's just how it is in most Asian restaurants. For this price I'm not complaining. Literally ate 5-6 plates so many to choose from. The fruits were very fresh and dessert was great too. Honestly most of the reviews is not really a true/honest representation; don't expect too much from a ten dollar unlimited eating place! Haha. But yes I would come again! It's literally 8 dollars cheaper than Pacific Seafood Buffet minus the crab legs and crawfish. Definitely bang for your buck if your not big on seafood. I was mainly here for the sushi and loved the selection of rolls and nigiris (salmon, tuna, eels, white fish)."}
{"text":"The food is relatively fresh and tasty, with a great selection. The staff on the other hand is awful. Most of them seem inconvenienced to be there, not a smile in sight. Don't enjoy your beverage too quickly because it's nearly impossible to get a refill. The tables are sticky. The cashier won't put his cell phone down long enough to acknowledge you and the servers will prop open the bathroom doors to the dining room to clean even if you are in the stall and you let them know you are there!"}
{"text":"I have tried just about all the super buffet in the Phoenix metropolitan. so I have a pretty good base for comparison. I find this place to be among the best. food is always fresh. they are supposed to be Oriental, but I see several dishes that are French origin. Several dished definitely European origin. An interesting combination of food."}
{"text":"Food was fresh, tasty and kept nicely warm.   Good variety.  Clean, pleasant place."}
{"text":"I love buffets.  I live about 3 blocks from this one.  It is well worth the 30+ min drive to far better buffets in town.  Very poor quality food."}
{"text":"Good ol' Chinese buffet.  Prices aren't bad and the food is decent.  Some items are better than others.  The squid was a little rubbery but the salt and pepper shrimp was melt-in-your-mouth good.  The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"I think its really good for all you can eat Chinese. The price is good. My daughter and i cost 16.79 for two of us. Child plus adult. Its very clean. People is friendly. Water is cute never hurts. However all staff i interacted with was fun. Males bathroom is even clean.... super clean. So all and all its oit of my way but id keep coming. True Chinese food peeps you may not be thrilled but there is enough i think it keep it called Chinese. More than just American- Chinese"}
{"text":"Took my wife for dinner on a Saturday night and ended up walking out after the first bite. The sushi was stale and room temp at best, with the selection limited to tuna and unagi. The food was terrible. I tried the s&s chicken and my wife tried some chicken with mushroom. Immediately after the first bites we looked at eachother and knew we were leaving. I feel bad only leaving a few bucks for the waitress but this place is revolting. How it got 4 stars is beyond me. I've had better chinese made by a french foreign national than this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I really liked this place. I thought the food and selection was great. We would return."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Asian buffets that we've tried, and over the years we've eaten at quite a few.   We came for lunch just before noon and there were already a couple of dozen patrons.  All the food we tried seemed fresh and at acceptable serving temperature.  Nothing we had was too oily or had too much sugar.  There was a good variety of items to eat.  I had several types of sushi and it was just fine.  The place is clean and well lit, with windows all around, making for a pleasant meal.  The restrooms were clean and well stocked, too.  The price seemed pretty low - 2 senior lunches, one iced tea, and tip were under $25.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Pros: Lots of food selection   Cons: Food has been sitting in warmers for way too long.  Pricey than most AYCE Chinese buffets.  I didn't really like the food."}
{"text":"I love their food.  The best Pork Roast I have ever eaten.  Immaculately clean and great food.  Great for the price."}
{"text":"Bad and rude service. Food bland and dry.  Not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"I ventured into New China Super Buffet with a Chinese friend who was in need of comfort food from her motherland.  This joint was walking distance from her motel so we decided to give it a go.  An autographed poster of LaToya Jackson was the first thing I saw when I made my way to the buffet tables.  This, sadly, was the best part of the meal.  Well, the egg drop soup and chocolate pudding were good too.  Aside from that the food was abysmal.  Even the standard sweet and sour chicken was lackluster.  My friend stuck with white rice, broccoli and some noodles because the rest of what she picked over was not to her liking.  The staff, however, was able to serve her a glass of hot water that was to her liking.  In a desperate attempt to find an item to my liking I went for the American standard...pizza.  Even that was bad.    The staff was friendly and accommodating and it's a shame the quality of food could not match up to the people working there.  I really hate to say it but New China Super Buffet is the worst Chinese buffet I have ever eaten in.  Because I enjoyed the soup and staff I will grant two stars upon this, er, fine establishment."}
{"text":"One of the best buffets around. Food was plentyful. Large assortment of foods, salads, desserts and sushi.  If I lived closer this would be a favorite local spot.  Restaurant was cleas and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years.  First I found the super buffet at Cactus and Tatum and they were good.  A lot better than New China.  They eventually closed down.  Then I discovered Shanghai super buffet at Bell Rd. and 42nd Ave. on a trip to the west side.  Now Shanghai is locked up tight with a notice on the door and their phone is out of service.  So I stopped at New China on the way back and was as disappointed as ever.  Their selection is weak, the staff is unfriendly and the atmosphere is disappointing.   I guess as I miss Shanghai super buffet more and more, I'll drive farther and farther to find one anywhere as good as Shanghai (without going to Shanghai).  :)    But, once again, I will not go back to New China buffet.  More than being a waste of money, it is a disappointment."}
{"text":"Great for what it is. A casual and cheap buffet. They even had a Suishi bar.   The selection was small, but they had all the basics you'd expect. I'd recommend if you're hungry and looking for a cheap place to eat"}
{"text":"Remodled.  Better food than before.  Excellent pork roast."}
{"text":"Every time I go here to eat I always have had a great experience! The food is overall fine, and the staff is on there game! But the reason why I am not giving this a 5 star is because the one who makes the sushi doesn't often refill what actually needs to be put out on the buffet, Instead he makes other rolls that are still sitting out on the buffet!"}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan. The service is very meh, it's your typical American-Chinese buffet style food. They have a very wide variety. Unfortunately, I don't eat meat anymore. That didn't persuade us to stop going. We still loved the place even though I was limited. But, our last couple of visits were bad. We no longer go. The first time we noticed a difference the majority of the food looked... old, stale, they were mostly empty. It was three hours before closing so we thought that was weird. We ate anyway and went on our way.  The next time there was a very long, kind of awful, hair cooked into my food. I pulled it out of my mouth and noticed that it wasn't from me. I lost my appetite. I had not eaten much at all so I pushed the plate away and sat with my boyfriend while he ate. (He didn't go through what I went through I guess?)  Needless to say, the waitress came over and asked if I was done with a puzzled look. I alarmed her of what happened and she literally rolled it off her shoulder as if it was normal for her to hear. I then sat back and didn't get another plate.   I didn't appreciate how they handled the situation but we spoke to a few other people at the restaurant to make sure they knew. It was pretty gross. We haven't gone back since, in over six months."}
{"text":"The New Super China Buffet has great food, great people, and great service. There are endless food options available and everything is made fresh daily.   Have you tried the party trays yet? We ordered several delicious dishes for Thanksgiving and all of our guests loved the food and the yummy desserts.  We ordered the party trays the day before and picked up the food hot and ready for our family party. I would recommend coming in to dine or ordering party trays for your next gathering."}
{"text":"Absolutely DISGUSTING ! Don't do it ! As a Chef I don't like to give any place a bad review but this place was terrible . Not only was the food bad tasting and highly questionable , the customer service was horrific . I got one of almost everything and the worst was the a chicken , how do you mess the up? I'll tell you how, let it go bad and then deep fry it thinking it's going to NOT taste rotten! To finish it off not even the soda was good , flat and didn't taste like original DrPepper . Ugh."}
{"text":"Yet another bad meal. This place is so close to home that I continue to try it thinking some food fairies will magically create some amazing food for my next visit but it never happens.   - meat is fatty and some parts chewy - lack of vegetable dishes - inconsistent cooking - staff is not really attentive/friendly  The plus to this place is it's clean and has free wifi. If you are craving Chinese and don't feel like driving far, this may fill that need but only in a pinch. I'm truly surprised they're still open for business."}
{"text":"Went for lunch a week ago with the same friend that found the place the first time.  None of te dishes were as good as our first visit we both agreed.   It was still a very busy place though. The beverage girl/woman was a bit snobby and said something negative about her tip in Mandrian and much to her surprise I called her on it!  Which shocked the crap out of her - it was priceless!  Little did she know that my Ex is Chinese and spoke the language fluently and thus I picked up something!  That'll teacher to under estimate the knowledge of a sister from the PNW hood!  Haha!"}
{"text":"So my wife and I have gone to this place several times now. The food isn't horrible. The price isn't horrible. The service is very horrible. Every time I go in here I feel like they think I just kicked their dog. The first couple times I thought maybe the girls serving us were just having horrible days but now every single time we have gone in there they are rude to us. I try to be extra nice to see if maybe I can get them to be decent just for a little but no luck. I'm sure they are upset that people don't tip what they think is appropriate but I know I tip very well and even did the first couple times. But I will not being going to a place where they don't appreciate my business. There are buffets on every corner and maybe they don't realize this but maybe they will when they are closed next year."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese buffet in town. Almost everything was cold!... Cold chicken. Come beef. Cold French fries. Choose elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm not picky on flavor, I see people saying the flavors weren't vast enough. I got a nice salad, side veggies, egg drop soup, a bunch of sushi, and chicken on a stick. Guess I don't have much of an appetite either. I didn't try the other chicken options, but out of everything I picked out I must say I was delightfully surprised at the flavors popping around my mouth. It didn't look like it was sitting out, it was hot and truly delicious! Great price for all of their options, they even have octopus you can eat! The cleanest buffet atmosphere I have ever seen, friendly Chinese staff, keep it up New China!"}
{"text":"Been going here for several years and I love it. Their selection is good and the taste and quality is great... and we have always had great service. As with any buffet, there are good and bad times to come. Rush hours can leave you with some empty trays but they work hard to keep up. We go around 4pm to beat the dinner rush. I like to eat without a crowd. LOL"}
{"text":"I love this place. Such a classic all-you-can-eat-buffet sort of situation. Staff was quick with refills and clearing plates and service was friendly."}
{"text":"A signed picture of a smiling LaToya Jackson greets you as you enter. The staff is friendly, the restaurant is spacious, and more than 80 items are offered, dessert included. But the food is far from memorable. A lot of the items were bland - even my favorite, fried chicken - and those which were not were sub par even for a buffet. And don't bother with the sushi; I've come to the conclusion that if you don't have a sushi chef preparing the sushi behind a sushi counter, it's probably not worth it. The establishment will probably survive, though. It looks like it's been there forever and seems to have a loyal customer base from Sun City. The perpetual bumper-to-bumper traffic on that part of Grand Avenue on the drive back to Phoenix was a fitting conclusion for this buffet excursion."}
{"text":"It was okay. The food was pretty good, well the food that was warm. I am a sushi lover and was looking forward to having some, however, when I bit into it I had to spit it right back out because it was disgusting. I usually get sushi rolls from Safeway and they definitely taste WAY better. The vegan fried rice and fried dumplings were my favorite, also very fresh! The fried shrimp was luke warm so I only had a bite, do not want to get sick lol. The cheesy broccoli w/ bacon was very good also very fresh. My boyfriend had some sesame chicken which he loved, but he ate so much I lost track. His crab legs were not done properly so I made sure he did not eat them. The waitress was okay, did not speak much English but made sure our empty plates were not left for long and our drinks were never empty. The flan desert was disgusting and also the cake was dry. The bathroom looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a while, so many people go I feel it should be neatly kept. However it was decent food, decent service, restaurant inside was pretty neat."}
{"text":"I usually come to this place for Chinese food. I'm pretty picky with Chinese food I like to see it before I buy it & a buffet style is the best thing or I would be paying so much money just for getting different things from the menu. Example like some restaurants they only give you lo mein but I want rice as well and they can't do that so I need to pay an extra plate just for rice. The pricing for the buffet is pretty reasonable as well. Drinks are extra.   They have salad, fruit, pizza, egg drop soup, hot & sour soup, different types of meats, sushi, desserts. I love their egg drop soup and those cracker things you put inside it. Also the chicken on a stick is good, it's my favorite. Some days they don't have it.   I believe this is a family owned restaurant cause the same people are always there and on the right side of the restaurant that's were they sit and do other things and sometimes they have a kid and plays around during the week.   Also they do have wifi. They also have tvs inside and each one is on a different channel. Also they are open on New Years."}
{"text":"Cold food. No taste. Rude very rude staff. Will never eat here again. Would not recommend to anyone.  I eat at a lot of Chinese Buffets. And this is by far the worst. High chairs looked like they have never been cleaned."}
{"text":"Average food for a reasonable price. Not the best Chinese food but it works."}
{"text":"Watch your credit or debit they steal 26 dolla bill we are great tippers left 7 bucks they changed to 10.      And food was not good but server was nice and promt but still to steal from customers is the  worst avoid like the pleg"}
{"text":"Good selection of food, but seemed like the person seating me felt inconvenienced with my presence. Also, wifi wouldn't connect; first world problems, I know.."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Sticky. Dirty. Humid.   This place is nasty.  The food is not good, and everything in there is soiled with food or sauce that had been dripping down.    YUCK!"}
{"text":"It is one of the best Chinese buffet I had in US. The staff were friendly and there are many kinds of food which you can eat. I like the shrimp and salad very much. The ice cream is awesome too. It is only 9.99 dollar for dinner. In all, I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This buffet might the the cleanest buffet in Maricopa County. This buffet over the past YEAR has scored grade \"A\" for the past twelve months so it seemed worthy of a try. I note all the food I tried seemed fresh and nothing seemed old. Most pans were kept filled. This buffet is inexpensive (around $12.00 on the weekend) and it's a very large buffet.  The atmosphere looks slightly dated but seems clean. To me the dining room reminds me on a convalescent home because of the wide chairs on wheels.  The staff at the hostess desk didn't greet us but did seat us quickly. I started by trying some sushi. For buffet sushi it was edible.   Then I did a small sampling of Asian type dishes. I tried 4 kinds of chicken dishes and the chicken was nicely prepared and seemed an above average quality for a budget buffet but all tasted the same no matter what I tried. All the chicken was in a sweet sauce that was slightly Asian tasting. An attractive pan of mixed vegetables was on the buffet....I thought I'd enjoy but DANG they tasted just like the chicken. That same sweet and slightly Asian taste.  The beef dish, pork dish and the salmon looked fresh made but you could tell by just looking at them they were over cooked. The salmon had lots of albumin formation and it looked like egg whites coming out of the salmon.   They had a breaded fish and I tried a chunk. The fish tasted like swai and had a panko coating that seemed oil free but was also free of seasoning.  I saw a very strange looking pan of macaroni and cheese. The actual pasta was orange in color.  The one thing I tried that actually seemed delicious was an egg tart. It had a light perfect crust and the filling was smooth and rich and tasted slightly sweet and cheesy.  They offer an assortment of desserts, ice cream and some fresh fruit.  Our server was efficient with the clearing of plates and offering refills but rolled her eyes when my husband wanted a refill. She seemed depressed the whole time we were there.  It wouldn't take much for this to be a good buffet..some things shouldn't be over cooked and much of the food only needs to be seasoned in a better tasting way.  It's clean and fresher than most buffets that I tried.  It's like a box of Almost Home Cookies....Almost Good."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. I liked the sushi Bari. The lunch buffet will set you back 12 bucks."}
{"text":"Every time I went to this buffet I swore it would be the last time. The food is... edible, but I worry about the cleanliness of the establishment. Everything is messy, including the areas around the hot foods, the ice cream bar (toppings EVERYWHERE), the floor, the bathrooms--if this is the front of the house, what does the kitchen look like? I don't even want to know. I went here because it was close to where I live, but no more. If you want really good Chinese food (though it's not a buffet) go to T&J's on Olive."}
{"text":"The food was horrible! It was out for way too long. I think I have  heard dinner is a better time to go! Lunch isn't the best time. ....I think at some point I think they toss out the lunch portion and remake fresh choices for dinner right ? But I shouldn't expect too much from a buffet. Also the waitresses rush you through your meal, or that's what I was feeling."}
{"text":"Well I wanted quantity over quality and I surely got that.  The food was so bad.  Not just a couple of dishes but everything including the deserts. Every dish was over cooked,  not hot, or stale.  I bet they reuse a lot of product due to the slow turnover.   The staff never greets you or makes you feel at home.  Last time I come here."}
{"text":"Awful. Since I am forced to give this place at least one star I will say that the restaurant is very clean and bright inside, but the food....... The food had the potential to be edible, but it was so old and dried out and petrified I think I spit more into my napkin than I actually swallowed. Imagine deep fried jerkey, gristle in every bite, sesame chicken tendons, inside out deep fried bites that are soggy on the outside and crispy on the inside. crab puffs so old and over cooked that the cream cheese has disappeared leaving only a hollow shell filled with brown crust, and iced tea that tastes like dirty dishwater. I could go on. I'm not a food snob and I know what I'm getting into when I go to a greasy Chinese buffet - They are hardly ever good but still appreciated. But this one was just plain bad."}
{"text":"It was OK thought it would be cheaper for the type of food and quality decent selection but nothing to write home about"}
{"text":"Lots of food to choose from. Also fruit, salad, and dessert. The older women who seats people is unfriendly, abrupt, and does NOT smile. She would rather be ANYWHERE else but THERE. Waitresses the same. They need NEW, FRIENDLY, SMILING, HAPPY, (or good at pretending to be), staff there. The food is alright, but that isn't enough for me. Nobody likes to be around people who aren't nice! The food isn't THAT good to make me want to go back! Fire the hostess!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, Terrible Food and very unfriendly staff...this was a two timer...first and last time for this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The busier it is, the better, because the fresh food keeps rolling out. If they've run low on something or the food looks like it's been sitting out for a while, just ask, and they will bring out more. They don't all speak English, but you can always point to what you want or ask your server or  the host/hostess. The price is very reasonable, especially since the selection is huge (don't forget to go past the sushi for the fresh fruit, desserts, and great ice cream). I love their hot tea; even their water tastes good. They come over immediately to seat you and get your drink order. I could go there every day (and sometimes do!) and the selection is large and varied enough so that I can have a completely different meal each time. Lunch and dinner selections are slightly different on weekdays. They post their health dept. inspection results because it's always \"A\". Free Wi-Fi, TV with the sound turned off/closed captions turned on, booths with tables that move so you can get really comfortable. I believe you can also order from a menu. They never rush you. Did I mention how delicious the food is? Do I have to? And, of course, it's all-you-can-eat. Do you know how expensive sushi is elsewhere? And spare ribs with lots of meat on them? And salmon? And crab legs (although they're not available every night)? You get more than your money's worth of scrumptious food. And ask for the senior discount. Everyone who works there smiles at me and treats me well  - because I smile at them - so be polite and ignore the complainers on here. Sometimes they have servers who have just recently arrived from China, so give them a break - go often so they get to know you. You'll probably see me there."}
{"text":"I have only done the take out buffet and I must say that the food is pretty good. I do pack my container until it is bursting at the seems but for $10 I want to make sure I get my money's worth. (Yes I am greedy but hey at last I can admit it) One of these days I will actually sit down and do the buffet but for now, take out buffet it is!"}
{"text":"My family doesn't opt for the buffet option very often but when the need for mass quantities of Sweet and Sour rears it's ugly head, I like knowing where to get that fix.  I have been looking for a new Chinese Buffet since our recent move to the North side of town.  New China is the closest to us and it had received pretty good reviews so I had high hopes.  We went at 5pm on a Sunday so that items would likely be hot and fresh.   First impression when I walked in the door...very dated interior.  I felt like I was in a drab version of Denny's.  It seemed reasonably clean though, so no major faults there.        The food selection was OK.  They had a Lemon Chicken (not so good) and a Sesame Chicken (pretty good) but no Orange or General Tso type option.  The Sweet and Sour chicken was very dry as were a few of the other things I tried.  The wife thought the best item they had was the pizza which always disappeared as soon as they set one out.  Unfortunately, I think that was more due to lack of other edible options than the deliciosity of the pie.  The BBQ ribs were good as was the Chicken on a skewer.    Drinks cost extra and it was definitely not worth the price we paid.  Around $50 for two adults and two kids.   I will be looking around for another Chinese Buffet or maybe we are just going to have to make the trek back over to \"Oriental Garden Super Buffet\" on Indian Bend which is the best buffet I have been to in the area."}
{"text":"So after a day of running errands, my friend and I were hungry. The Indian food buffet wore off after 8 hours of being on the go...  ...and we ended up stopping at this place. This was the 2nd time we've eaten there. The first time we ended up being the last people there despite our 7:30pm arrival...they were shutting the place down around us that time.  This time we knew better. Or so we thought.  We arrived at 8:15, thinking we had enough time...oh hell to the no. Somehow the packed to the gills buffet had managed to somehow become completely empty by 9:00pm -- leaving us there as the only patrons. ugh.  Anyway, since we were there the last time and it was close to closing time, we found the food cold and sub par and frankly, just not good.  This time, we found the food cold and sub par, but marginally better.  Service was snappy and I swear, I didn't even get a chance to put my fork down before the girl was grabbing my plate -- and I wasn't done.  What is it with servers grabbing my plates before I'm done? I think it's just this side of town. I'm a slow eater and I still had veggies on my plate I hadn't even had a chance to tuck into!  As we were there, my friend kept listing all the health codes they were breaking - \"bleach is a no-no!\" and some others that I wasn't paying attention to.  I'll come here again ONLY if fast food is not an option."}
{"text":"This place is not even worth a star...The buffet choice is the worse out of all Chinese buffets I've been too. I went to the salad bar to get dressing and the choices were French, Ranch, Italian, and Hot Mustard. WHO PUTS HOT MUSTARD ON A SALAD BAR...IT SHOULD BE HONEY MUSTARD...REALLY"}
{"text":"Soo this place, seriously needs to be investigated on their food safety. I was terrified to eat there, but I was already sat.  I would say half the food was missing and not replaced since they only had 3 more Hours til closing. For real don't go here, I legit need a shower just for being in this place"}
{"text":"the price is ok. but the food was cold. everything i ate was cold except the soup only thing that was hot... i wont be coming no time soon... the staff are friendly and nice..."}
{"text":"We just went to this restaurant for lunch because we got a flyer in the mail. The flyer said lunch was till4. When we got there at 3:45 we assumed that we were being charged the lunch price. You don't pay until after you've eaten. When we walked in I had said to the lady we're here for lunch. Later they gave us a check and it was for dinner. The flyer was wrong. They had a sign on the wall that said lunch till 330 not four. They charged us 12: 44 for dinner when the flyer had said 11:44. The woman behind the counter was not very nice. The food was good and we enjoyed it in there we just did not like the deception."}
{"text":"I give new china four stars for consistency! I have been coming here off and on for many years now since they first opened over 12 years ago and they are always good.  The food is hot and fresh, amd they always fill the buffetwoth real dishes,  not a lot of \"filler\" items that no one wants.  The fish is always tasty and fresh.  Lots of fresh fruit and desserts too.  The staff is always very nice and they treat customers well.  A very good buffet in north Phoenix!"}
{"text":"There was a lot of food choices but most of it was cold or just plain old not good.  It was also very pricey IMO.  Maybe it was just because of the weekend prices but I don't feel it was worth 12 dollars.    I would suggest trying a different place or doing the lunch as I bet it will be a better deal."}
{"text":"I was expecting a little more selection. There were flies flying around the sushi bar and the waitress kept getting our drinks wrong. Could be better"}
{"text":"Having lived in China, I'm still willing to make huge concessions for American Chinese cuisine, but I can't for this place. Everything tastes subpar, bland to no flavor, and the quality of meats was noticeably poor."}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised there's images of the inside of this place, and people still come to eat here. The stains on the wallpaper and the crooked rolling chairs must be overlooked by these 5 star reviews. Spent $30 here for tasteless food and to listen to the owner yelling across the buffet at her co worker, while we were being seated. I truly believe this buffet is overpriced and overestimated. With rude workers and bland food. I'd write more about this buffet, but my memory has battled hard to forget this place exists.   In other words, not recommended.  The two stars are for my drink and the nice lady who picked up my plate after I left."}
{"text":"it's cheap and decent but not as good as a more expensive one i went to in scottsdale called jasmine tokyo. it has a ton of selection for chinese food like tso chicken, won-ton, egg drop soup, sweet and sour chicken, dumplings, orange chicken, etc... and  even some sushi."}
{"text":"I wasn't all that impressed with this location. I passed it many times during the time I lived in Phoenix and had heard from other people about how good the food was. I almost always check the rating on Yelp for every new place I want to try out and saw that this place was average for a Chinese buffet place in Phoenix. Kind of reluctant to try it out, I still decided to drop in.  When you exit your car the aroma of the food hits you right away and that alone brings people in, but that's pretty much the extent of the amazingness of this place. It looked like your average buffet place. The same kind of set up with the buffets, the tables and booths were older, rug definitely looked as though it's been used for a long time and the employees had the same kind of attitude as they do at all the other buffet place I've been to. They are so monotone, with no personality. They don't smile or anything. Makes me feel uncomfortable with I have a waitress like that.   The buffet had quite a lot of different things to offer. They had your normal salad section, fresh fruit, desserts, different noodles, fried and white rice, many meat dishes, a small sushi area, egg and spring rolls, wings, chicken nuggets, corn, green beans, seafood dishes, skewers, and more. Many of the dishes looked like they had been sitting out for awhile while other dishes were empty when I first came in. I got myself a little bit of a few different dishes, but nothing tasted all that great. Same as any other place.   I was seated in the very back at a table that was suited more for a large party than a party of just two. Not sure why we were placed there since there were many smaller tables closer to the front of the restaurant. We were literally seated where the employees sit and eat and where they store their clean supplies!! The restroom was clean but needs a major updating. Everything was so old looking!  Price seemed a bit high for lunch during the week, especially since we didn't get a drink."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Food is good (for buffet) sushi is usually fresh and tasty. A little slow on refills for drinks but friendly service. Decent selection to choose from. Pricing not bad considering  it's ALL u can eat."}
{"text":"Food was AMAZING , they have a big selector and the sushi is good to ... The place is clean and had slot of space , it's very affordable too"}
{"text":"I've been a few times and this past was by far the best. Great service, always good food and sushi bar worth it alone for the price."}
{"text":"The staff doesn't care about customer service. The food is definitely not kept at regulation temperatures I question their food safety standards. Not much selection. Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Never have I seen a good Chinese buffet, and this is no exception. Not my choice to go here, but I did try to find something I could like. Literally everything here was pretty yucky or on the opposite end, flavorless (or the the wrong flavor). Why so much intense red dye in everything, and why does the blood red \"sweet and sour\" sauce have only sweetness?  Do they think the red dye will somehow add sourness?  Same stuff they used on the ribs. Do they even taste their food?  I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 only because they have a decent selection of fresh fruit and their wait staff was efficient while I was there."}
{"text":"We have ended up at this buffet a couple of times because it was in the area.  However, the customer service is terrible everytime.  It is way over priced for the quality of their food.  We are never satisfied when we leave this place."}
{"text":"If Chinese buffet is what you desire, just keep driving northwest on Grand to the other place!    The food is low quality and the place is one of the dirtiest I've seen in the Valley!  They do have a friendly staff and a vast selection, and so I can award them one star.    Overall this is as bad as it gets, and would have to be starving to walk away satisfied eating here."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative rating I would!    My dad and I had eaten here years ago and it was great!  We wanted Chinese and went in February 2014.  We walked in and we should of known to leave as soon as we hit the wall of grease in the air!    The man behind the counter was more worried about his looks and the floor fan than seating us.   The waitresses were too busy to get you a drink.   The food was rolling out, but it was stone cold \"fresh\" from the kitchen.  Not one item was hot, let alone edible.  All food is to be maintained at 160 degrees, but it was like it just came out of the refrigerator!  Nothing like trying to have a nice meal with dad, and you end up getting sick because of a few bites!   Don't eat here, go get a frozen meal or McDonald's instead!  It will be better tasting and hot!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving Chinese food after several hours of shopping (and I am happy to report that I found some really cute boots).   First thing first...the people working there (if you consider standing around talking and laughing working) were very rude. They seem to have no interest in their customer's dining experience.   The food was horrible. The rice with vegetables was so undercooked. I felt like it was leftover uncooked rice that had been thrown at a bride and groom from a wedding several weeks before. They had one piece of egg foo young sitting out. I tried it and it was horrible. They should call it egg poo young!  We will never go there again. We would rather starve than eat there. It was not clean. Someone needs to call the Health Department!"}
{"text":"Overall, I like the food. Some of the younger female servers are nice, but that's about it.   I usually go during lunch, and always get always overcharged. I pay dinner prices, even though the rate is cheaper for lunch. Hardly ever getting a second plate. So much that I quit going there."}
{"text":"The food is ok and there is a decent selection. It's priced about right for a Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Everything was cold and questionable. How is this place in business? Temperatures on hot food was room temperature. Half of the food looked like it was hours ago. Salad was old. Ceaser salad was like soup. Ranch dressing was watered down. My cookie was stale. Sushi... good luck. Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"The food was good and fresh lots of dishes especially seafood, we had a friend who loves seafood and it was a heaven for him. It was Saturday we arrived about 12:30pm for lunch but we were told it's dinner, I did not want to argue with them I am not sure if weekend they have one rate- dinner rate, but they were 3 of us, one had tea as a drink and 2 waters and the bill came to $35.00, I assume the dinner was $9.95 plus taxes. There were lots of desserts, cookies, cake and fruits and ice cream, it was worth the money."}
{"text":"Love the variety.  Just about every kind of traditional Chinese fare along with cheese pizza, Mac & Cheese and an Italian noodle dish that looked a little like Alfredo. (Didn't try those, but picky kids might appreciate the options).  Soups, sushi and food is good and the price is appropriate.  Definitely hitting the dessert bar and ice cream on the way out.  Restaurant is clean, bathrooms are checked regularly and seating is old school but in good order."}
{"text":"People that work here act like they are being inconvenienced by having to deal with customers. Food isn't worth it. They dump new food onto old food. Gross."}
{"text":"Our first time here even though it is less than 2 miles from our house for the past 3 years.  The food was cold and really did not taste good. The biggest problem was how unsanitary it is.  The cabinets were dirty but not horrible.  Then we went to the restrooms.  I have seen cleaner bathrooms in truck stops on my way to Nogales.  It really looked like the bathroom from Saw the movie.  Wonder what kitchen looks like. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"These people are rude. My wife had weightloss surgery that we ask if we get discount cause she can only eat small portions. They were talking Chinese dont know if they were talking smack. Then we were seated. The waiter had her eye on us by sitting behind us. Used to like buffet. Now it is worse. Food was not all that great. Workers were horrible. Usually I give tips but they did not earn. If a restaurants are selfish then they dont deserve it"}
{"text":"Another all I can eat review!  My coworkers and I came here to celebrate one of my other coworker's birthday.  He loves this place, it's his absolutely favourite place in the entire America.  He eats here almost everyday.  He make the big bucks.  So that is why we took him here for his birthday because if we didn't, he would had came here anyways.    The location is very clean for a buffet place.  The plates were spotless.  The tables were clean too.  The restaurant had excellent lighting, has plenty of seating.  And the staff people were friendly and attentive definitely professional people here.  They had a great variety of foods.  When compared to other buffet Asian food it was of decent quality.  There was definitely more different foods to eat than stomach capacity to try everything in one sitting.   The loo was well kept.  The toilet is on par with a common house toilet.  Had to do a two to make more room to try their sushi which was not too great, but you get what you pay for and you don't throw a fit.   Overall a good experience, fair prices for the quality, I will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"It's an ok place, the food tasted cheap and not very friendly, more of a\"eat your food and go\" vibe."}
{"text":"It was OK.  I've eaten in much worse and I've had much better (Vegas).  There is plenty of selection and the food is typical of an Oriental buffet.  As with all buffets, you need to get there around meal time; any later and you'll get lukewarm leftovers in the steam trays.    The restaurant is large and clean; the servers are typical for a Chinese buffet; they are there to bring you a drink, your bill and to pick up the dirty dishes.  If you are expecting any level of service above that you need to pick something other than a buffet.   If you're in the area and need a buffet fix, this place will fill the bill.  If you want a gourmet, cooked to order Asian cuisine you need to keep looking."}
{"text":"EEEkk!!! DO NOT! I repeat DO NOT go here!!! the food is not at all impressive. It's your regular Chinese buffet selection. but the service thought!!!! geez! its the worst! im not sure what was going on that day but the owner and the waitress were so RUDE! extreme rude! unnecessarily rude!!!"}
{"text":"Just another typical Chinese buffet .. nothing to write home about for sure .. pig food..don't waste your time or money .."}
{"text":"As Chinese buffets go in Phoenix, this is one of the best we've found. For reasonable prices there is a good selection. The sushi is decent if uninspired. There are usually some great egg tarts. The food is in general basic and neither spicy nor overly salted. There is typically some decent fruit and good desserts, yes desserts in a Chinese restaurant that are worth eating. Clean by the standards of such places but without much atmosphere. Definitely a place to bring kids since the food is accessible. If you're looking for the unusual bit of the orient, go elsewhere; but for the average American wanting a decent affordable meal, this is g good solid bet."}
{"text":"The buffet is better than average. Good shrimp and crab bake.  It's a little more Americanized than I like but it tasted very good.  Sushi was good too. The place is clean and lots of seating for big parties and service was quick. The desserts aren't great, not very tasty."}
{"text":"I love their food when it's fresh so I only go during peak meal hours. However overall their food is good. I like to eat here then go shopping at winco, I always leave New China Super Buffet full and happy. I feel their prices are totally fair. They have a selection of standard Chinese dishes, as well as som good sushi, a salad bar, and a nice selection of deserts. I think my only complaint is sometimes the kids of the workers get a little loud and run around the dining area but they are cute so I don't mind all that much unless I'm trying to talk to my partner overall I think it's a good place to bring your family to eat"}
{"text":"The food is alright. The staff is so rude. They need to learn customer service. They just don't care. The lady was so rude, never going back again. My suggestion theres much better Chinese buffet places than this. Don't go here.!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice, both times the food was cold, and old.  The service was sub standard as well both times. Do yourself a favor and pick somewhere else. The good reviews HAVE to be from employees."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Phoenix to spend our anniversary and he is a HUGE buffet fan. We Yelped this place and the reviews were mixed. So we tried it... OMG!!! This place was great! The price was a bit high, and I think the drink is not included, but regardless the people are friendly, the place is very clean, and the first thing that hits you at the door is the nice aroma of the food. What was even nicer was how CLEAN this place was. The ventilation system is awesome as the place was a pleasant temperature, the food smells did not mix and overwhelm your senses, and on a day where the temp was 105 F outside, we enjoyed our Sunday afternoon quite pleasantly. We WILL definitely recommend and come here again when we visit.  Food Selection is not enormous, but well stocked, fresh, and good variety. Mostly Asian theme, not like other buffets more \"Americanized\", and the desserts were off the charts. Especially the chocolate cake squares (heavenly). Large Sushi bar with live sushi guy keeping bar stocked and fresh. Nice flavor combinations. Only thing I missed was the Ice Cream, but I was pleasantly surprised to find they had Mexican  FLAN (a millk and caramel based desert) and it was pretty good. Fresh shrimp, crab legs, beef roast, pork and chicken dishes, awesome crab ragoons, and sooo much more! Thumbs up. Dined on a Sunday afternoon. Total Spent for two people was $28.00"}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good Chinese buffet since moving to the Phoenix area about two years ago. So far, this was our best try. Still, wasn't impressed.  When we walked in the door, nobody greeted us. We stood there looking like lost kids for a while, searching for a \"seat yourself\" sign or directions on what to do. Finally, someone told us they'd be with us in a minute. Ok.  By the way, the place was almost empty.   Got a table, and ordered beverages. When I went up to get food, much if it had definitely been sitting there for a while. There was little left in many bins, and what was left was lukewarm and well..tasted like it looked. A bit stale and dry. That said, I did like the green beans. I never try sea food at Chinese buffets, so I can't tell you how that was. Didn't look great.  I didn't get much with my first run through, so I went up a second time. Some items had finally been replaced or at least refreshed with fresh food. Maybe we were there on an off day. I don't know. I have yet to find a really good place.  Extra review : we had a little one with us. The high chairs were disgusting."}
{"text":"I am a huge Chinese food fan so it's hard for me to dislike any Chinese restaurant or buffets. Usually when I come here the food is fresh and hot but coming her an hour before close was a very bad idea. food was cold and sushi was getting hard. staff could be more friendly but I don't feel that they're being rude on purpose, just can't speak English.  the place is kept very clean and none of the food is repulsive so that's nice. I would still come back, just not right before close again."}
{"text":"I was starving and I literally did not eat all day so I came with very little expectations.  Because honestly almost everything would taste good when one is super hungry.  I am sad to say that was not the case.  Do not eat here.  The only thing I found edible were the sesame chicken and crab rangoon, which are pretty hard to mess up.  The establishment is being a bit over ambitious with its low quality ingredients.    -eggrolls: zero meat, too much cornstarch  & celery, why oh why do you put celery in there? -sushi: not recommended,  rice were hard but soggy at the same time. -Battered crab: stale and soggy (I spat it out) -lomein: I was afraid to try after the experience.  In the trash it goes, waste of 11.50$ plus taxes, for a carry out order.  They don't weigh the food here, just flat box rate.  I am making Ramen as I type this, because I found my food to be inedible.  On the good note: the place looked pretty clean."}
{"text":"Decently priced bland Asian buffet. The food was lackluster but the place is clean. The servers are brisk but attentive. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if you need to seat a large group of people who like mediocre Chinese food this is your place."}
{"text":"Meh. Not bad. Not great. Price is reasonable, and variety is about what you'd expect. I've been to much worse. You won't get sick, you won't be thrilled with the food either though. All in all, a decent super buffet. I'll go back without a fight when the group demands it, but never by choice."}
{"text":"Very little selection and honestly the worst customer service. No one greeted us, staff right past us and we didn't know whether we needed to seat ourselves or wait....but we were hungry and it did the trick"}
{"text":"My first impression was that the selection was very wide, despite what I've read from other reviewers. They had quite a few dishes I haven't seen at a Chinese buffet before. Almost every single pan was filled high and steaming, and employees were constantly changing out pans. I must have tried about 8 different meat dishes and none of them were overcooked, the veggies were all colorful and firm and not-wilty.  Their sushi bar has a lot of potential, but they need to work on keeping the pre-made rolls fresher. For the price, though, it was not bad at all, and could definitely be what gets them more return customers. (I didn't realize until on my way out that they also make sushi to-order.)   Favorites:  Egg tart was BOMB. Totally didn't see that one coming, but it was sweet and creamy and the egg taste was not off-putting at all. Shumai was great Sesame chicken was great  Dinner and a soda for two adults on Sunday came out to about $25.60 before tip."}
{"text":"disgusting food rude workers. signs everywhere to not take more food than you can eat/not to wase food to prevent rise in cost....if food was edible i would eat it.  $28 for me n hubby wasted."}
{"text":"I dinned at this restaurant this evening, and the only positive thing that i have to say is that the soda was cold and fizzy. The service was rude, the food on the buffet was out too long that was becoming crusty and unappealing. There was a lack of selection. The name of the restaurant don't fit the size of the buffet table. I will not go there again & I strongly urge every that is considering this place to dine to look in to other options such as hometown buffet, pizza buffet, & Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet.  I give this two thumbs down and even two toes down"}
{"text":"Good service, the food was great, not sure how much it is yet, so I'm gunna eat like its 20bux lol"}
{"text":"Great variety. Good quality. Nice price.  No complaints."}
