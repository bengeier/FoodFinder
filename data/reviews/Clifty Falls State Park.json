{"text":"The limestone walls and cliffs are absolutely gorgeous. There are wild turkeys all over the place which is kind of fun. The owl noises at night were also cool. The people who work at the park were friendly and helpful. We did our hiking on the north side of the park. The rugged trails were pretty narrow & steep. I actually slipped downhill & ended up on my butt! Trail 2 is literally in the creek so you'll sprain an ankle if you're not careful. Bring an extra pair of shoes because you will be soaked after this. We found some cool fossils in the creek. Going back uphill is a lot harder so keep that in mind. Downtown Madison is cute but we didn't visit there. The pool was a nice relief on a hot day (open noon - 6pm). Now the con's: the bathrooms close to site #47 were just plain gross. However, the bathrooms at the pool were very good. A campstore would be nice for camp souvenirs. The inn has some stuff but it's not the same. The nuclear power plant next door is so ugly against nature's beauty. (The lookout tower by the nature center is the best example.) The caves & tunnels are closed due to white nose syndrome in bats."}
{"text":"Very nice park. Was a little disappointed that I didn't get to see the falls, came in the wrong season for them :-( but aside from that the park has great trails and a walk through cave."}
{"text":"Clifty Falls is an overlooked state Park nestled by Historic Madison. The hiking is amazing and the waterfalls are beatiful. I better note that the falls are low and more like a small stream with not much water, or a crazy river after a large downpour. It is a great place to go for a weekend trip."}
{"text":"I go bike riding in this park several times a week. The roads are gently rolling and the pavement is smooth. Traffic is usually sparse and drivers are normally respectful of walkers and bike riders on the road. No bikes are permitted on the trails. That would be suicide.  
The naturalist there is a walking fountain of interesting facts about the real world of nature. He is a state treasure, hope he doesn't retire."}
{"text":"Went here as a kid, and hadn't been back for 20 years or so. Was so pleased to find that it is just as wonderful as I remember! We started at Hoffman falls and did a full hike around and up to the waterfall. It was absolutely gorgeous! We were very impressed with the abundance of fossils that were present in the area.

After a long exploration of that area, we headed up to big and little clifty. This had great access for people of all ages, even those who are unable or uninterested in hiking! I wish that there were better views of little clifty accessible without hiking up the entire river, but we will definitely make that journey the next time we are there.  All in all, the trails were in much better shape and clearly better maintained then when I had gone as a child, leaving much of our hiking and exploration a relatively easy experience.

Overall, it was a fantastic experience, and I loved being able to share this favorite childhood location with my husband and son!"}
{"text":"A lot of the hiking paths are super steep and slick so the hike was less enjoyable along with the fact it was hard to see the waterfalls and the heights you were at because there was too much brush. In some spots were you could see the beauty it was great. The inn was air conditioned well and the wifi was great. But in our room it was musty, humid, and dank in the air and our beds. The food was decent but overpriced by several dollars. The indoor pool was nice and warm and had a basketball hoop."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the hike in this park.
It is true that the entrance fee is little pricey.  I think you even pay by person and not by car but I am not 100% sure because I got there early in the morning and there was no one at the entrance.
I started at the nature center (trail 1), hiked through trail 2 to the cliffty falls. Trail 2 was fun 'cuz I hiked through semi dried creek bed. I didn't mind uneven surface, stones and wet rocks and some water but it could be a potential minus for some.
I returned to the nature center via loop and it took about 4.5 hours of semi- fast walk.
It was a very hot day but since it is mostly shaded by trees, it turned out to be a great hike.
Don't expect to see any great falls, maybe after a rain but what I saw was only tiny falls but still it was really pretty.
There is a tunnel / cave like area you can go through an explore during certain parts of the year.  Check the below map for details.
Afterwards I went to downtown Madison to check out the place and had a bite to eat. It was a nice trip.

Below is a map for your convenience if interested:

{"text":"First off the park itself is awesome! Great trails and beautiful falls. The Clifty Falls Inn however is about 2 stars. The lobby area and the newer part of the hotel are really nice but if you get the lower priced room expect lower amenities. The shower was either full hot or full cold, no warm, burn or freeze was the only two options. A dirty was cloth was left in the room when we checked in. The air conditioner sounds like a freight train and runs all the time, hard to sleep. The humidity level in the room made everything feel damp. I would recommend the park but not the inn at least not the double queen room."}
{"text":"Out of all the state parks I have been to here in Indiana, this one rates as my second best. The few interactions I've had with park staff they're friendly and helpful. Most of the trails are rugged which excites me as I like the challenge and usually the more rugged the trail, the more cool stuff you can see. We came back to Clifty Falls as in Oct the creeks were pretty dry and unimpressive. We were told that January to June is the best time to see all the waterfalls and I was not disappointed at all. The falls were pretty and it was fun climbing on all the rocks to try and get all the best shots. The public spaces appear to be clean and well maintained. It even seems that some of the railings and bridges have been recently rebuilt. There are a few trails that I'm still wanting to do, and will be back again."}
{"text":"Best place in KYiana for hiking amd picnicking!  awesome trails and varying landscapes. Many trails interconnect so you can hike all day.Pretty easy to follow trals as well or go off and find your way back. Lots of fossils and wildlife.  Plenty of room for a picnic or bbq'ing. Just a really great place."}
{"text":"Honestly, best state park in Indiana! Camping is great. Showers and bathrooms are newer and very clean. Pool is huge and clean. Trails are maintained and excellent! I am a huge fan of Clifty. Highly recommend it, 2 hours from Indy so why not check it out!"}
{"text":"Great place to hike, relax and take in the sites. I prefer to hike here in the late fall, winter & early spring just to avoid the crowds & ticks. The paths are clean & clearly marked, I have found that some of the best hiking is just to venture off the main path and explore. If your willing to get off path and get a little dirty then you will encounter streams, rock formations, fossils and addition falls that many will miss by following the main paths. Its easy to spend a day at the park and what could be better than seeing the various water falls after a recent rain.  

There are four named & advertised waterfalls in the park and maybe 18 others for a total of 22 waterfalls. Each of these are seasonal and best seen after a rain. Bring the family, spend a day and take in a picnic.    

This park isn't far from those of us in southern Indiana or across the river in Louisville."}
{"text":"I will need to get back here when it is not so hot. 

First thing to know, is there is an admission price per car ($9 for out of state and $7 for in state), and I believe it is cash only.
IF they offer you a map, take it, and if they don't offer one, ask for it. Even if you have been before, it is still useful to have, there is a lot of ground to cover.
The trails, which there are plenty of, are not always clearly or well marked (hence the map). I see other reviews where people state they are very well marked, so this could be my un-familiarity with the trails.
This place is BEAUTIFUL. There are miles and miles of trails, with falls, creeks, bridges, rocks, and stairs/ be prepared for stairs. 

I will be back to explore more and will be more prepared with more water and stuff than my first time here!"}
{"text":"We have stayed at Clifty Falls Inn several times, and with good reason.  Nice, clean rooms. The interior of the inn is very pretty.  The restaurant is decent.  We get the breakfast buffet which usually is good.  This last time though, the food on the buffet wasn't always hot.  The pool was closed due to some maintenance issues, which was very disappointing.  I wish they would make an announcement on their website if the pool isn't available.  We will definitely go back though.  Love Clifty Falls and Madison!"}
{"text":"We love this State Park and the Inn.  It is clean, staff is friendly, trails are gorgeous (but I agree, not all are for the casual walker).  The pool at the Inn isn't huge, but it's big enough and is kept up very well.  The pool in the park is very nice too.

This week we ended up here on some rainy days.  Still lots to do in the area and at the Inn.  At the Inn we swam, played some board games provided, and had our meals at the restaurant.  The park is just moments away from Historic Madison, so we took in some shops and other attractions.  Park is nearby to a movie theatre too if that is your interest."}
{"text":"There is a big, damn lie told in coastal areas of the United States.  That lie is sinister; it is cruel; it is close to blasphemy.  This falsehood teaches that the central part of the country, Indiana included, is boring, plain, ugly, uncultured, and not worth visiting.  It is \"flyover country.\"  Should anyone stand in protest of this moniker, all he or she would need is a collage of pictures from Clifty Falls State Park.  A visit to this majestic place could warm the heart and stimulate the mind of even the most highfalutin beachfront property owner.

Located on the outskirts of Madison, Indiana, one of the most picturesque towns in the state, Clifty Falls has something to offer everyone.  The park is huge - 1,416 acres!  Due to its size and amenities, it is perfect for a weekend getaway.  However, it is likewise a fantastic choice for an afternoon nature excursion.  Having 10 hiking trails (plus a really cool old 19th-century railroad tunnel), most of which are rugged, the experienced hiker will not be disappointed.  While it is certainly not as rugged as the Rockies or the Alaska Range, the rolling hills of Southern Indiana still provide scenic cliffs, rushing water, and uphill climbs.  Be sure to come prepared if you plan to take the rugged trails.  For those who are not able to complete the rugged trails, the park has plenty of easy-to-moderate paths.  You will still see some beautiful sights, including the waterfalls, on the easiest trails.  One thing is for certain: Clifty Falls is the perfect place to get an out-of-the-gym workout!

Clifty Falls State Park has large campgrounds - both primitive and non-primitive.  Personally, I'd rather sleep at the lovely Clify Inn.  The inn has the usual hotel amenities - including an indoor pool.  Better yet, you can eat your fill of good, down-home, Hoosier cuisine.  If you're staying for the weekend, be sure to venture into Madison for a meal on the Ohio River.

Clifty Falls State Park: proving Indiana isn't \"flyover country\" since 1920!"}
{"text":"I think I found one thing Indiana has to offer ,this park is beautiful! With  all the trees I feel this is a place that you can hike in the dead of summer"}
{"text":"This is a great state park. We spent one night at the campground. The facilities were very clean and well kept. We spent the second night at Clifty Inn. We had a pleasant stay there as well. The falls and natural landscape were beautiful. Most of the trails are rugged, which make for great exercise! They have a quant nature center with a few reptiles. You should also check out the tower while your in that area. There is a great view of the river from there."}
{"text":"Clifty falls is a great little park. It is located adjacent to Historic Madison which is big on charm. It is a quiet park that appears to be expertly maintained with plenty of amenities for all levels of hikers, campers and other enthusiasts alike."}
{"text":"I spent the day hiking around clifty falls with a friend. The trails that were very rugged, I probably wouldn't bring my dogs due to the steep climbs and rocks. There are quite a few trails, while there are signs it got a little confusing. We had to keep checking the map to make sure we were on the right trail. I think some other people were confused too because they were asking us for directions ha. The trails were really fun and the scenery is beautiful. The state park was definitely a nice escape from the flat terrain of Indiana. This park is a great weekend getaway for anyone !"}
{"text":"Our whole family had a blast here!!! 

Chilly and rainy didn't matter. Trails to walk. Waterfalls to admire. Nature to explore. Quiet. Not too busy. 

Staying in the Inn was great. Rooms nice and spacious and supplied with dishes, hair drier, and items one would need. Wonderful bathroom with jet tub and shower. Separate bedroom. Pull out couch for the kids. 
Nice dining area. Always kind, polite staff who aim to please. Good was delicious. Kids under 3 eat the buffet for free. 
Lodge had tables and couches and fire place. Always a place to continue a puzzle or play checkers chat with new friends. 
Kids favorite was the pool. Good size. Nice ramp into. A little loud in there. 
AND the Nature Center right near the Inn. Wonderful fun for the kids while it rained. So much to learn and do and see. 
Reasonable price, especially Monday through Thursday. 

Cozy place. LOTS of fun. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"These trails are not for the faint of heart.  

My wife, a friend, our Golden Doodle Audrey and I embarked on a few of the trails in Clifty Falls last weekend and I was thrilled!  Getting to Clifty is very straight-forward and finding a trail-head is easy enough with parking lots adjacent to most.  The paths are not your typical well-beaten roads, however.  Many are quite rugged and difficult to traverse.  It will give you quite a workout and even my intrepid Doodle was exhausted by the end of the day.  She really, really didn't want to get out of bed the next morning.

Our visit was in early June on a very temperate, comfortable day.  The paths that go along the creek make it much more enjoyable on warm days since the temperature drops significantly down near the water.  The falls are beautiful and lead to lovely babbling brooks and shallow tributaries.  

Strap on your hiking boots, fill up your Camel Back and get out there and enjoy Clifty Falls!"}
{"text":"OMG, I AM SO PISSED OFF!!!
We paid the $9 entrance fee to go into the park. She asked me if we were from out of state, charged us the $9. We told her we are going hiking to the four waterfalls. Asked for a map, she said \"We don't have any, but you can check at the Inn\"
Even at the Inn, the ladies gave us the map and we told her going hiking to see the falls....we made it plain...we want to see the falls!!!!
Well, after hiking down about 100 steep stairs we found out the water was dried up...so we had to hike back out of there!!!!
Why didn't that park lady tell us when she took my money!!!! We would have turned around!!!
Such a waste of MONEY $$$$"}
{"text":"Great park to hike and enjoy nature.

Things I liked about the place:
1. Park was much cooler as compared to surrounding areas because of trees all around.
2. Trails are numbered and not named which I think is easier to remember.
3. Trails are marked on the basis of their difficulty.
4. Views on the way are spectacular, especially creeks originating from the falls.
5. There is a cool cave on trail 5. I mean really cool. 
6. Didn't see much litter on way."}
{"text":"Great hiking trails with a variety of easy to moderately hard terrains. Perfect picnic spots for family reunion or get togethers. The campground looks nice as well."}
{"text":"Upper loop is 4.5 miles of hilly terrain on the road.   Runners in the weekend are all over the upper loop. The lodge has an outstanding view up and down the Ohio River from the bluff.   Slight noise from the power plant nearby but it quickly downs out as you hike the trails.   It's a great park."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite state parks in Indiana.  There are lots of trails to choose from, lots of places to picnic, a small nature center, an inn and camping.  It was $7 per car to get into the park with Indiana license plates.  At the main gate they also had a posting of the activities for the day such as guided hikes, a program about bats and more.  

We camped this past weekend in the non-electric section.  While we had a nice shady spot about half of the spots have little to no shade which can be brutal in the heat.  When you reserve your campsites online it will give you an idea of how much shade to expect.  Restrooms were clean and modern at the campground.  At the gate to get into the campground you can purchase firewood ($6) and bags of ice ($2). 

The outdoor pool was really nice and was a good size. Even on a hot day it was busy but didn't feel crowded.  It was $3 for each person with kids under 2 admitted free.  They also have a small concession stand that sold ice cream, nachos, French fries, hot dogs, etc.  The nachos ($3) weren't anything special but the kids needed a snack.  The kids loved the water slide.  Smaller kids could ride down with an adult if they had a life jacket on.  One word of warning was that there was only a couple of umbrellas for shade mostly in the snack area. I spoke to a life guard who allowed me to use an extra umbrella to help shade my toddler.  Pool is a must for hot days."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I used to go camping every weekend for years growing up so I am quite the camper / hiker when it comes to these sorts of things. 

This was a quick, spontaneous trip as I've never been here before and wanted o get out of the city- not too far, not too expensive, seemed great. 

And overall, it did deliver what I was looking for from the trip and the state park. My biggest complaints are: 1- the trails are poorly labeled in random places. And not only that, some of the trails don't even connect to anything. You just walk and walk and then end up on a road! As campers, we weren't thrilled about having to end our hike on a road. 2- the camp sites (at least in the non-electric) seem to be a bit close together. Our campsite had no even ground so we were forced to put our tent on what seemed to be a 25-35 degree angle. Also, it was right by the playground and screaming children and raccoons that stole our food, but that's not the camp's fault; it just made for better stories. 3- the firewood they gave us hadn't dried out enough so we had to literally put the firewood we purchased from the office around the fire pit to dry it out as we had the fire. 

Overall, it's a good park but some of the attractions are a bit underwhelming, especially the watch tower. 

I'd recommend going in the winter and or spring so there's a lot of rain to pick the falls up, we only got to see trickles, but still, great views and a much needed getaway."}
{"text":"This is a very nice State park and it is very close to Louisville so you can drive over and spend the day and not get home real late. We took a picnic lunch and spent the day hiking some of the trails and hiked over to see the Fall s. It was very pretty and the hike was fairly easy do. They have some very nice picnic areas and trails so be sure and take advantage of them. Check out their website before you go as you will get information and a downloadable map. We plan to return again soon."}
{"text":"Great family park, but not so good for hiking. The individual trails are short and not well connected. Signage is sparse, and even an expert navigator would find herself/himself confused by the park map. Many of the trails are rocky, so if you have knee issues, this is not the park for you.  

We had very few insect issues today(6/18/16): no ticks, just a few flies, gnats, and mosquitoes.  I suggest wearing shoes that are designed for hiking and water sports if you want to walk in the creek.  If you are not an Indiana resident, you will have to pay a whopping $9.00 to get in. They do take credit cards."}
{"text":"Our favorite park to hike at so far. Cake rock, Clifty Falls and the caves are so cool."}
{"text":"Snow and wind in the winter.  But the place is a charm.  Beautiful!  It is total of 16 of us from a meet up hiking group.  Great leaders and team members."}
{"text":"Easily the best hiking I've ever done in Indiana, with gorgeous panoramic style views.  I went in October, the falls weren't very impressive, but the trees....some girls may swoon over sunsets and sunrises, but some of us swoon over amazing groves of trees nestled together like a patchwork quilt of soft gold, crimson red and fire orange leaves. 

Needless to say, this state park has views that are majestic enough to make someone with no true talents wax poetic nonetheless.

The Clifty Inn cafeteria food was somewhere between $8-$13 for an entree (at lunch time), a little more than I was expecting, but the quality was there.

I don't think all of the forks in the paths are marked super clearly, most of the other hikers we passed were just as uncertain as we were as to which trail they were on. But the trails are such a joy, it's hard to mind the contemplation that you may be headed further into the woods than on your way out. Incidentally, we were fairly easily able to stay on the trail we intended to take, despite many moments of indecision at various forks along the way.


This place is just a gem inside of Indiana. Take the whole family. It's totally worth it."}
{"text":"When I first visited HC, my mom and I had reservations at some random motel in uptown Madison.  When the lady at the college admissions office found that out, she quickly referred us to Clifty.  She even offered to help us book a room there.  We were like, hrmmm, either Clifty is really good or our motel is really shady.  It was both!  
Clifty is cheap (well compared to Hawaii hotels) and their staff is really friendly.  The rooms were clean and had a homey feel to them.  The restaurant in the hotel had cheap food it was good too :).  They had a station for free coffee or tea in the middle of the night.  They even had games in their lounge area.  Nice views from the park.  Also, I stayed here and camped.  That experience was fun too. 
The whole hiking thing was fun at the park too!  We got to see the falls once.  Nice short hike.  Lots of good photog opportunities!"}
{"text":"Clifty Falls is a great state park. As other reviewers have noted the admission price is crazy, but the financial situation of Indiana state parks is big issue in the state. A quick Google search will confirm this sad fact. Unlike other state parks in Indiana most of the trails in this park are straight down and then straight back-up. Finding a long flat hike is not easy. More so than in any other Indiana state park hikers need to stay on the marked trails! People have gotten killed here! A quick search on the web showed that there were deaths in this park in 1962, 2010 and 2012. Please enjoy the park safely and come back alive!"}
{"text":"My first experience at camp ground camping. Probably doesn't count since I am staying in a fancy Winnebago. Nothing like waking up in the morning to birds singing and dogs barking. I so much appreciate these people bringing their dogs. Other helpful tidbits: probably not a good idea to go to the bath house with a pink towel. Just sayin.....

And why is it that guys showers don't have curtains but girls do?

Went down to the lodge the next day.  It has been completely remodeled.  Very nicely done"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic visit. We spent the better part of a day here. We spent a good deal of that time on the many hiking trails there. They have many majestic views of the many waterfalls there which is the main draw here. They also had a scheduled tour where they had a very knowledgeable park attendant take us down to show us a cave that had some rare bats in it which was a huge treat. They had a decent nature center that had some cool things in it and we wrapped up the day by grilling out on one of their many grills that was available. All in all this is a fantastic park and whether you want to enjoy the majestic falls or a good camping spot this is a must stop for any outdoor person."}
{"text":"This park is beautiful. I have been going to Clifty for the last 20 years and I've never once had any problems with this park. 
 
It has always been very clean. Some parks I've been to in the past I've wondered if they even have any one there to upkeep the bathroom, or fallen limbs and trees, or even just to make sure that there is no trash thrown on the grounds. 

The pool area is super nice, I love taking my kids there. They even saw their momma jump off the diving board for the first time there (Or slide off anyhow) 

The falls are so majestic and the trails can get steep but as long as you stick to the path you will be fine. I am even thinking about investing in a walking stick to help out with my hip on the harder trails. This is a definite must see if you love to hike, camp, or swim! A great weekend getaway"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Southern Indiana!  I grew up in Madison and we used to camp here a lot.  The hotel and restaurant are newly renovated and really nice.  There are plenty of trails in varying degrees of difficulty too.  All in all, a great State Park!!!"}
{"text":"This place is dear to my heart and I've never even been there to hike! My wife and I, before we were married, would take little vacations down to the hotel at Clifty Falls during the off season when they have 2 nights for 1 specials typically during the late fall and winter. The park is beautiful with plenty of trails, beautiful falls and lots of interesting geological features left over from when Indiana was a tropical beach. The restaurant at the hotel is acceptable for dining. The rooms are clean. The staff is friendly, The gift shop is well stocked. While not exactly within walking distance from old town Madison, you're just about three minutes away. The view of the Ohio river from one of the south facing rooms puts one at ease and the white noise generated by the coal plant will make you sleep like a baby. 
My family now, several years later, makes the trip here every Thanksgiving to eat the buffet at the Inn and stay for a few nights. I start looking forward to this in about mid July. The wifi service kind of sucks, but, dude, you're at a state park... go your ass on a walk or look out the window or something."}
{"text":"Spent a day at Clifty Falls doing all of the trails! It has now become my favorite park due to the awesome views and trail difficultly. So many waterfalls and gorgeous scenery. Definitely go knowing you will get wet and dirty but that's half the fun!"}
{"text":"What a fun and beautiful Indiana state park to add to your bucket list. Our visit kicked off on a lucky foot (free admission -- no idea why, but the sign was out and we rolled in for nada). Second, the weather was just right - I could imagine our mini hike feeling quite different later in the summer with the abundance of water and mosquitos. Third, the falls are so lovely. The sheet rock style of the falls made me think of Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater home in Pennsylvania. Last, but not least, the trails are very easily marked and offer all levels (easy to rugged). Clifty Falls is located within 10 minutes of both Hanover College and downtown historic Madison on the river."}
{"text":"It only takes a little more than an hour's drive to take you a world away. Hubby and I have been missing out on this great state park!  The only regret we have is that we did not come here sooner and visited more often!  

Clifty Falls State Park has something for everyone.  For true hikers who need to traverse real terrain and cross creeks, you will be glad to hike Trail 2 for hours.  The drive-by-photo-op-tourists can enter through the north entrance, be parked and looking over the gorge within 10minutes of entering the gate.  And for those amature hikers like hubby and I, Trail 7 (1.25mile one way) has the perfect combo of moderately rugged terrain, wide and narrow paths as well as stairs.  There is this awesome Cake Rock that is not to be missed.  Part of Trail 7 is also ADA accessible to the Clifty Falls Overlook area.  See? There is something for everyone!  

Although I have heard that late fall is not the best time to view waterfalls due to the low water levels, we still were able to see plenty of water going over the falls.   Hubby and I lingered over the overlooks for the longest time.  We can't wait to come back in the spring months when water level is higher."}
{"text":"Nice state park with well priced rooms. We like the ones with a patio outside and a view of the river. . Warning. Youe will see electric wires and the power plant. But is you are \" selectively\" choosy, this is a nice place. And Madison is a charming town."}
{"text":"The trails at Clifty Falls are mostly rated Rugged or Very Rugged.  There are only two that are Moderate.  My husband had to try the Very Rugged #2 since I asked him not to.  He said it WAS rugged and wandered back and forth as part of it was closed due to a flooded stream. It wandered between trails 1 and 3.  He loved it.

As all Indiana state parks, it was extremely well organized.  If you can, enter off Route 56.  The Inn is less than a mile from the south entrance.  We entered from the north off of Route 62 at night and it is over 4 miles to the Inn.  The roads are very twisty but it is a scenic road, even in the winter.

It is hard to get lost with the excellent signage.  There is a nature center, closed in the winter of course.

The trees are mostly deciduous so there isn't much green in the winter but Clifty Falls does have a stark beauty.  Don't miss this state park - one of the most impressive in the Indiana system."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this park. The roads are paved and well maintained. The toilet facilities were clean and stocked. The trails had wooden steps and rails in some places and they were very sturdy. The views here are breath taking! It was an amazing hike down into the canyon. We were able to see three of four waterfalls, and plan to go back soon. I would advise making sure there has been rainfall recently in order to ensure the falls aren't dry."}
{"text":"After the remodeling of the Inn, the roads, restrooms, and trails, this state park is looking pretty fine these days.  Everything is super lush and green right now because of the wonderful weather we've been having. The waterfalls are actually falling water, as opposed to years in the past of tiny trickles.

Other great news, the cave tunnel is open again!! So, bring your flashlights and wet hiking gear because this is a must do for any outdoor adventurer. 

Side note: Through August of 2016 the inn is offering buy one night, get the second half off.  This is an incredible deal, the views from the riverside are priceless and offer amazing sunset shots."}
{"text":"What an absolutely amazing, beautiful state park!

Yesterday, the Indianapolis Hiking Club had 2 hikes scheduled - a 5-6 mile morning hike and a 5-6 mile afternoon hike.  

The morning group consisted of 22 hikers.  The morning hike ended up being about 6 miles with an elevation gain of around 600 feet.  Pretty tame but absolutely beautiful with the leaves changing color...but the water fall was only a trickle due to the drought this year.

After lunch at the Clifty Inn, the afternoon hike had 18 hikers.  Due to some confusion with the trail markers, we ended up going 8 miles rather than 6, but this was 'real' hiking!  We had an elevation gain of about 1500 feet and one definitely had to pay attention to where one put their feet as we traversed creek beds and narrow trails with sharp dropoffs.  Great mental workout as well as physical.

Our hike leader, Jim, did a fantastic job of leading us and taking care of hikers with more limited abilities.  My only 'complaint' is that the state park service should do a better job of marking the trails as they can be very confusing at times.  But with the experienced hikers in the group, we found our way with very little back tracking.

The Indianapolis Hiking Club has been around for 53 years and the hikers in the Club range in age up into their 90s!  Many of my hiking companions yesterday are old enough to be my parents, but they keep on truckin'...kudos to them and their active life style!

Although it took a little over 2 hours to get to Clifty Falls State Park from Indianapolis, this state park is located in southern Indiana, it was well worth the time it took to get there and I definitely plan on coming back here before Fall is over...next time I'll remember to bring my camera."}
{"text":"Since the weather was so beautiful this weekend, I decided it was finally time for me to explore the park during our annual choir retreat.
There are more trails than I expected there to be, though they often overlap.
The trails, the falls, the whole area is gorgeous! The trails are (mostly) clearly and well marked and pretty easy to follow. Some of the trails are much more rugged than the others, so grab a map and keep to the trails you feel prepared for! But even on the most rugged trail, I felt not impossibly challenged.
A great way to spend a day, and only about an hour outside of Louisville. An easy day trip!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to hike. There are trails ranging from very easy to difficult. The trails also intersect with each other a lot- making it easy to make your own way through the park. There are several beautiful waterfalls to see. 

Make sure you take a map! You do not want to get turned around or lost while you are out exploring. 

There is also a lovely inn if sleeping on the ground isn't your thing!"}
{"text":"We took advantage of a bright and sunny, Friday in February to explore Clifty Falls State Park. Coming from downtown Madison, we entered through the South Gate near the Clifty Inn. The roads are steep and winding in spots, but offer an increasingly good view of the landscape.

We wanted to explore the Hoffman Falls which aren't far from the entrance - according to the downloadable map found on the park's website. With few markers, we passed the parking lot and ended up half way through the property. It was a gorgeous drive, so we didn't mind being a bit lost.

After locating the right spot, we parked and hiked a short way down a steep trail. The website had said this was the largest falls on site (& I thought they were supposed to be 80+ feet). What we encountered was a beautiful, but small waterfall. Not sure if this is due to low water levels or the time of year. 

We didn't have a lot of time to do a full trail, so we headed back to the car and drove back into town. I'm excited to go back when it warms up and I can spend a half day hiking and exporting the park."}
{"text":"I really like Clifty Falls State Park, I have family who live right on the edge of it.. So we gotten lost on the trails before, gone up to the look out platform and I enjoyed running in the park while hear over Thanksgiving. The trails are great, they also have open area's perfect for a picnic or kicking a soccer ball around! 
Always lots of wildlife around, I didn't see any deer this time but I saw lots of really big birds, not like the Sesame Street kind, but like the Eagles and Buzzards kind.. Can you imagine if you were walking in the woods on a trail and actually saw Big Bird from Sesame Street that would blow my mind and I would be geeking out! Maybe next time, but for now I'll just enjoy the nature!"}
{"text":"Great park, but definitely recommended for experienced hikers in decent shape. The elevation changes are a real ass killer. Very steep at times, you will be sore and very tired after! Biggest suggestion is spend $20 bucks, go on amazon, and get some retractable hiking sticks. They will really help you with balance here as some trails are steep, narrow, and very rocky. I brought one, wish I would have brought two. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate! My friend and I went and only spent two hours here and felt like we were there for six hours. Trail 8 has great views and is very long. Trail 2 is basically a super rocky dry creek bed so avoid if you're concerned about twisting an ankle. Trail 5 is steep and tough to go down or up. I wish I could've spent a longer time here. Unfortunately, it had not rained in the area in about two weeks so the \"falls\" were merely a trickle. Everyone we ran into was very nice and everyone helped each other with figuring out the best routes. There is a big parking lot at the north gate with an open meadow and a rest room, with drinking fountains which was nice because you'll need plenty of water. If you take your pet, make sure they're in proper shape. The steepness of this park, glad I didn't take my dogs who are getting up there in age. I would have had to carry them. Next time I'll go earlier and possibly stay the night. Great place for potentially a two day overnight trip or camping. Find food in nearby Madison, about 5 minutes from the park. Trails are very rocky so I highly recommend hiking boots that go higher up on your ankle to avoid injury. In early October, no issues with insects, but we both sprayed ourselves down before we went. We did see one snake but it was going away from us. Pretty, bring your camera! If you're coming from I65, wait until you get to Madison to fuel up on gas and food. 4 stars because I think they could do a better job marking trails, and more areas for water."}
{"text":"Very peaceful place to walk, hike and relax.  Also, has a great pool and a lovely Inn."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Clifty Falls State Park. We chose our spot online and couldn't have been happier with our choice! The campground was clean, sites were large, and you weren't right on top of other campers. The trails were well maintained and the park staff was friendly and inviting! We will definitely be coming back to this park. We highly recommend doing the tunnel trail and walking through it, it was really
neat!"}
{"text":"Great park- pretty rugged trails- even the moderate ones- beautiful hike - great inn- I wish the trails were marked a bit better- dog-friendly"}
