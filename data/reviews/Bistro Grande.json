{"text":"I went here a while back but i recently joined yelp so i decided to write a review on my experience. This place serves kosher dairy dishes and different types of fish. Between two people we ordered bruschetta, salmon pizza and fettucine alfredo. All three were scrumptious! the pasta was extremely tasty and left me wanting more after each bite. It was both creamy and buttery. The pizza was something ive never tried before and i was a bit skeptical about salmon on it. After trying it though ill definitely have it again! It was the perfect amount of salmon on top of the sauce and cheese. The crust had a perfect crisp. The bruschetta was moist, with many tomatoes and garlic on top. It was amazing! Oh i cant forget they gave us complimentary bread with an olive oil side to start. My boyfriend couldn't stop eating it, i had to actually stop him before he stuffed himself ! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The only positive thing about this restaurant is that it Kosher!  Been in this place twice and every time I get the feeling that they are doing a favor by serving me and letting me spend my money at their place.  The food is so so and the prices are ridiculously high. A dinner for 2 with a glass of wine racks up to $120.00.  If it wasn't for the Kosher kitchen I would think twice if to go there again."}
{"text":"It's really hard to write this review, because this is a strictly Kosher (dairy) restaurant, and I don't keep Kosher, so I have the full range of restaurants to pick from.  If I only had the handful that Kosher-strict people have, I would probably rate this restaurant much higher.    That being said, I do eat a lot of vegetarian food, so I do know that it can have full flavour and full taste.  My tuna confit salad was void of these things, although presentation on the plate was gorgeous.  Prices are EXTREMELY high for what you get, again, because it's Kosher.  Everything is at least 150% more money than it would be at a non-Kosher restaurant.  For example, an omelet could run you upwards of $20.  Coffee was good, service was fine.  I'd go back if I had to dine with people who kept Kosher again, but not good enough to warrant non-Kosher customers."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance  Seemed understaffed because of the holiday Waitress could have been more attentive  Will definitely return next time I visit Toronto"}
{"text":"The other night a few of us were looking for a place nearby that would let us enjoy a good meal while enjoying the beautiful weather. We stumbled upon this kosher bistro and although we had some initial hesitation (none of us are strictly kosher) we ended up having a very good experience.  The d√©cor is very upscale, each table lined with a double tablecloth. The carpet covering the entire dining space is a great buffer allowing conversation not to resonate through the restaurant.  The menu is varied with many pizza, pasta and fish options. Obviously, the restaurant being kosher-dairy meant there was no meat on the menu. We covered our bases with one person ordering a pizza, one a pasta, and one a fish. Prior to the meal, they offered two different varieties of homemade bread (white and whole grain) accompanied by three different spreads (butter, oil and vinegar, and garlic hummus). The bread was very fresh and soft.  Our mains were incredibly tasty. The pizza was thin-crust, covered with mounds of cheese and chopped up fresh vegetables. I had no problem finishing it up in one sitting (but big enough that I probably should have taken about half of it home). The individual who had the pasta, enjoyed it but did feel she was missing a vegetable component to her meal. The other person who had a fish, thought it was perfectly cooked and the accompanying vegetables/potatoes were not overcooked and had a crispness to them.  Servers were prompt and for a mid-week evening, the restaurant was almost full. The lost star was related to the prices. All members of our party felt that everything was about $5 overpriced. Some of this extra expense is related to the cost required to make the food meet kosher requirements but it was still high. None of us found the price would deter us from returning (and a few of remarked that it's the Jew in us that had us 'kvetching' about the price).  All in all, you don't need to be Jewish to eat here, the clientele are varied in their cultural affiliation; however, you do need to recognize that this restaurant follows strict kosher requirements.   All 3 of us decided we would definitely return in the future and walked out happy we took a chance on this place."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a chance after I last visited here 3 years ago. Maybe things had changed, maybe they worked on the food and maybe it was worth the $$ that they charged their clientele.  The ambiance was just as beautiful and as classy when I walked in. But then I started looking at the details. I was there for a birthday and the tables that were set up were a complete mess. Some settings had main menus and sushi menus (I'll get on that in a minute), and some just had menus. I also acknowledge that this is a small thing, but it is the details for a place priced so high but even the sugar packet holder wasn't presentable. It looks like random packets were just jammed in while in a rush.   There were some good things though. I was told that the Penne Arbiatta sauce was good and I was really impressed that they had a change table for us to change our daughter. Now the bad stuff.  When was the last time that you went to an Italian Bistro for the Sushi? Never right? Which it's why I'm as confused as to why there is sushi available on the menu here? It has no place and just indicates to me that the restaurant doesn't want to define its identity and bank on what it's good at (not that it is but what it assumes it's good at). I'm all for fusion restaurants, but not at a place called Bistro Grande.  I was curious about the Seafood Risotto for a kosher place, are they going to use Pollock? Are they going to use imitation seafood? No, when I asked about it, their Seafood Risotto included Tuna and Salmon. For $28, I just found that ridiculously overpriced. Mid to top range Seafood risottos would be priced around $22 and it would at least be true to what people would expect the dish to be. If I ordered this dish and received just Tuna and Salmon, I would be livid. I mean technically it's correct it is seafood, but it's not what most would expect from the order, meanwhile at a higher price.  I ended up ordering the Fettuccini Alfredo instead. I thought \"there would no way they could screw that up and they got 2 of the 3 ingredients in the sauce. Parmesan cheese didn't seem to make it in though. So I just had Fettuccini in butter and cream. I had to pile it on the pasta after the fact to make it edible. I really wasn't impressed I wouldn't have priced this pasta higher than $9 and that would be even a stretch for me. The pasta was also WELL overcooked. It was the furthest thing of al dente that it fell apart on my plate. It's actually astonishing the lack of care that these dishes receive and are pushed out to customers.  I was also kind of confounded when we asked if we could get a smaller portion for our daughter to eat and we were told \"No\" we'd have to order a full portion meal which I wasn't prepared to do if it weren't for the fact that my daughter has the powerful need to eat on occasion.  The restaurant is also in a dead zone (at least for Rogers), so don't expect to tweet, Instagram, e-mail while you are here.  No, I wouldn't recommend going here. I was really unhappy with the food and the service (again)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great choice for anybody who eats kosher or has issues with food allergies or just simply wants a fabulous dairy meal. I have eaten there many times and been happy every time with everything I've ordered. In fact I've often taken people who don't necessarily eat kosher but are extremely satisfied with the food and the service."}
{"text":"Come here if you're looking to spend a lot of money on very little food that isn't anything special.  Wildly overpriced menu. Mediocre service. Restaurant is nice, but it isn't proportional to the costs. Also totally inconvenient parking.  $30 for soup and salad. Nuf said"}
